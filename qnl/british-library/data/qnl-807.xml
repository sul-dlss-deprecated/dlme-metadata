Minister Nepal No« 14 dated 1st November which was copied to you on 2nd November under our No .Ext* 5632* After consultation with the Foreign Office we have come to the conclusion that we should not support the Nepalese Minister if he places an order for a Proctor and a Dominie. On the other hand awkward consequences might ensue if we were placed in the position of having to refuse to support such an order. We would prefer thereforeto prevent the situation from arising. (I understand that an actual order has ' t • • J -/ A not yet been placed 9 but that the IJinister has so far singly been making enquiries.; In these circumstances we have with the concurrence of the Foreign Office sent the attached telegram to Nepal and the Government of India. We hope that this will produce the desired result, and in the meantime we assume that you will take no action in the matter without prior consultation with us. jxglexe - 6 £ diiw aoifAtLvat&amp;o ici*! * (Sgd.)

The position t they point out is that the Nepalese Minister has made an enquiry regarding Dominie^ and Procter*but has not indented. As regards the performance of this aircraft, I have no doubt that the External Affairs Department are quoting either the Civil Aviation Directorate or Air Headquarters, or both. It is perfectly true that neither aircraft has a very large reserve of power for operation over high country and at high aerodromes} for the latter some reduction in load might be necessary. Not having detailed knowledge of the terrain and other conditions at our disposal neither the Civil Aviation Ministry nor I can make any specific recommendation. The Procter might be condemned as a single engine aircraft for flying over mountainous country^but I doubt if we can rule out single engined aircraft and there is little doubt that it will be able to fly to and from Katmandu even though it might be necessary to cut the load slightly.*^ Dominie might be criticised as having inadequate ceiling with one engine to cross the high country safely (its one engine ceiling is approximately 2,500 feet). On the other hand there is no other sma.ll aircraft available which has an adequate single engine ceiling. The fact is that ihere is no alternative aircraft available to offer to Nepal now and if they are prepared to accept the Dominie and Proctor with a knowledge of their limitations, no harm will be done. Later on they should be able to replace these aircraft by the De Havilland Dove which I have no doubt will meet their requirements, unless by that time they find they want stxnething much bigger and higher powered.

Before telegraphing we had perhaps better find out from Mr. Canpbell^. who in the War Office is concerned in this^ and consult him. It would be as well to inform Mr. Plunkett of the Foreign Office at the same time of what we are proposing to do. Meantime, Mr. Campbell should hold his hand.

His Highness the Maharaja states that before receiving this ‘ information he had already written to the Nepalese Minister in landon - His Excellency Mineral Sir Singha Shumshere, K.B.R. - directing him to make enquiries both in 2hgland and from America regarding a passenger aircraft capable of carrying some 5 or 6 passengers and also of smaller planes such as ijoths.

Nevertheless His Highness says that he would prefer to accept it only so far as the smaller aeroplanes are concerned. •s His Hi liness has learned that several big aerodroisss are being built in Northern Bihar His Hi hness does not now feel that there is any necessity for him to maintain a big plane. 3. /ith regard to the training of pilots and provision of trainin and equipment of Ground Staff for the maintenance of aircraft in i'fepal His Highness states that his Iciowledge regarding such matters is somewhat vague.

When His Highness receives this information and knows how Ion training will take ho will give his views regarding this matter. 4* is Highness has noted with pleasure that should an emergency arise as the result of disrupted rail cosjcmnication in which it becomes necessary to re-establish a temporary air service, suoh as exist* at present between India aid Nepal, the Governcx^nt of India will come to -fcpal ’ s assistance and asked me to thank the Gover mcnt of India for this assuring information.
