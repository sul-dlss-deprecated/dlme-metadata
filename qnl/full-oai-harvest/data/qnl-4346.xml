The last file enclosure (folio 46) consists of file notes and lists four documents in the file that are numbered folios 36 to 39. This list wrongly identifies the document numbered folio 37 as folio 38 and vice versa.</extent><extent>Foliation: numbered 1-3, 5-17, 17A, 18-19, 27, 29-46. The numbers 4, 20-26 and 28 have been omitted. The numbering is written in pencil in the top right corner of the folio, starting at the front of the file, on the file cover (f 1) and ending on the inside cover at the back of the file (f 47).Condition: folio 5 is damaged. A tear in the bottom right corner partly obliterates the following written information: ‘1926’and ‘the Foreign’.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file contains several Government of India circular letters and memoranda 1926-1928, 1930 and 1937-1939, for information and guidance on the ordering and supply of government paper, printed forms and other items of stationery.
