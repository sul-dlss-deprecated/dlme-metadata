The origin of the fund, named after the late Haji Khudadad bin Mohammed, who was Supply Agent at the British naval station at Bassidu [Bāsa‘īdū], is explained in a note written by staff at the Political Residency (folio 3). The funds were to be spent on Shia charities, but as no Shia charities existed in Bahrain, the annual allocation there of 350 Indian rupees was handed over to Dr Ralph Holmes of the Victoria Memorial Hospital in Manama, where it was to be used to assist poor Shias.The file includes:lists of individuals in Bahrain to whom money was paid (indicated in Indian rupees) from the Haji Khudadad fund;statements of expenditure incurred by the Political Agency in Bahrain from the Haji Khudadad fund;annual letters from Haji bin Ruqiayeh [also spelt Rokeya, Roqiyeh, Ruqieh, Rogya] requesting his inheritance from the estate of Haji Khudadad, followed by annual instructions from the British Residency to issue payment to Haji bin Ruqiayeh of 20 Indian rupees;correspondence concerning the expenditure in Dubai of money from the Haji Khudadad fund on beds for the Dubai hospital.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Victoria Memorial Hospital, Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Al Maktoum Hospital, Dubai</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Haji Khudadad bin Mohammed</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Charities</topic></subject><subject><topic>Hospitals</topic></subject><subject><topic>Shīʻah</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00012d#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00012d#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
