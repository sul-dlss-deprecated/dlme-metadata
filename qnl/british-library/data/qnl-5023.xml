Dear Sir, Jeddah. Referring to the interview which our Mr. Williem Boulton had with Mr. Kidstone, we now beg to ask for your permission to open a branch of the Alliance Bank of Egypt at Jeddah, which Bank is now in course of being established at Cairo, the two parties Interested in this Bank at the present time being the Alliance Bank of Simla, in which we are considerably interested, and ourselves. Before proceeding with the foxmation of this Bank, we received a letter from Mr. Secretary Balfour, informing us that His Majesty's Government would welcome the establisiment of a Bank on the lines which we then indicated to you. Ve would remind you of the several conversations that we had with the Foreign Office some time ago with regard to this matter, when we fully explained our desire for opening at Jeddah and our plans for doing so, which we discussed with Sir Ronald Graham. It was brought to our notice that it might be desirable to establish relations with Messrs. Gellatly, Hanley A; Go., Shipping Agents, etc., who have been established at Jeddah for sane time, we have now come to a provisional agreenent with this firm, and we enclose you a copy of a letter that we have received from them. The object of our wishing to establish ourselves at Jeddah is purely for the purpose of carrying on business Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Foreign Office, Whitehall, S.'W.l.business as Merchant Bankers, and for reasons which we fully appreciate, we propose that in the first instance we would simply send an experienced Banking official to Jeddah, to work in Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey's office, so as to take over and guide the Banking tusiness which that firm has been carrying on during the war. By this means it will enable us to gradually establish ourselves with Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey &amp; Co. at Jeddah, and quietly develop the Merchant Banking business. We trust that our application may now have your favourable consideration, and if there is any further infomation that you may require, we shall be glad if you will kindly let us know. T:9br[U wDock House, Billiter street, London, E.C.3. j 1st March, 1919. Dear Sirs, Deferring to the interviews ■ r. Llewelyn Evan-Thomas has had with you, we confim that we are agreeable when the time is opportune, to give your firm the opportunity of joining our firm at Jeddah in any banking business or business that uay develop requiring finance. You quite appreciate that in the past the banking business at Jeddah has been quite inconsiderable; there is practically no export trade and the imports are simply those required for Mecca. The Imperial Ottoman Bank opened an agency at Jeddah, but we were informed at the time that they did so unwillingly in connection with the affairs of the Imperial Regie Tobacco, which business is, of course, ended. However, there may be a possibility of finance with the new Arab Government, although our feeling is that if the Arabs retain what we understand they want, Damascus, that City will probably became more of a commercial centre than Jeddah, as Mecca is a holy place and no Christian will be allowed there. We will keep you advised how matters progress, but, of course, any arrangement we come to will have to be subject to the approval of our Foreign Office. We are, etc. (Sd) GELLATLY, HALKEY &amp; CO. tessrs. Boulton Brothers &amp; Co. 39 Old Broad Street, LONDON, E,C.Com. 6) o . • c &gt; MBtim ntncn, Ibl.h, 191V.

I am to state that before forwarding this letter Sir R.

In communicating to you this reservation on the part of Captain Lloyd, I am to add that Mr. Balfour has no fear that your firm will misapprehend the situation, since it has been verbally explained to your Chief Partner at his interviews with this Department. The situation is, as you will understand, one of some delicacy, and it would be unadvisable for your firm to go beyond the arrangement already proposed to you, namely that you should expand your business along existing lines with a view to possible development in the future.

Boulton Bros. &amp; Co., 39, Old Broad Street, Dear Lord Hardinge, I am obliged for your letter, in which you kindly say that though it is difficult for you to give me an interview, the letter which I recently sent to the Foreign Office will receive careful consideration. I fully appreciate your inability in these days to accede to iry request for an interview, but in view of this, I trust you will allow rne to put in the form of a personal letter what I could not suitably say in an 'official one. When I visited Egypt in March, on my return from India, I was received with every consideration by the High Commissioner, and I believe that my firm's proposal of opening in Egypt, in conjunction with the Alliance Bank of Simla, Limited, under the name of the Alliance Bank of Egypt, and possibly of extending operations to Jeddah, was favourably considered. I now learn, however, that the prospect of our proposed Bank being appointed the Government of Egypt's Agent at Jeddah is, for some reason I am unable to explain, less hopeful. I am well aware that my firm, on the grounds of having been, I think I may say, unusually successful and enterprising, has encountered London, E. C. 2. June 20th,1917. ^ Ht.Hon.

The very extended list of shareholders of the Allaince Bank of Simla, Limited, comprising well-known names, is some evidence of the confidence with which that institution is regarded. It appears to he evident that there is now some undeserved stigma attaching to us in official quarters in London, and all I ask is the elementary English right, which I am confident you will concede, of knowing what that stigma is in order that it may he entirely removed, as I assure you will he the case. I feel extremely diffident in writing to you this personal letter at the present time, knowing full well how your attention is required for matters of national urgency, hut hope you will excuse me doing so, on the grounds that the matter in question does really affect very greatly our firm’s standing and interests.

Messrs Gellatly, Hankey &lt;&amp; Co*, &lt; L0ND01T, E.C.3. Dear Sirs Hed.jaz State Bank We beg to hand you herewith duplicate copy of our letter of the 21st ult. regarding this matter which was sent you through Government channels in order to maintain secrecy* You will notice that this letter also is by special permission sent you under Service cover. Imperial Ottoman Bank We take this opportunity to write you rather more freely with reference to this matter. The position at this end is that, after we had obtained the authority of the Arab Government for the proposed transfer to us of the Bank*s assets, and after the British Resident here had advised us that the Authorities in Cairo would be unlikely to interfere, we were asked to call at the Agency to see Capt* Lloyd, M.P. who in the meantime had arrived in Jeddah* Our conversation with Capt. Lloyd rather reversed our cabled advice to you that the Brit is Authorities were not interested in this matter, but at Capt* Lloyd's suggestion we did not communicate with you again as he had arranged for Cairo to cable the foreign Office asking them to see. you in London and advise you of the Government's attitude and wishes. It was agreed between Capt. Lloyd and ourselves, at his request, that, if in the meantime we received advice from you that you had already completed arrangements with the I.0.Bank in London we should communicate with him before actually informing the Bank's Manager here that we accepted the proposed transfer of assets. We gathered from Capt* Lloyd that the attitude of the Government is not yet quite known, and that in view of the Hedjaz State Bank proposal, concerning which we have written you, it may be desired that neither we not anyone else have any semblance of connection with the I.0.Bank in Jeddah* If it is finally approved that we take over the Bank's assets, we believe we should be required to do so strictly in the capacity of Liquidators, and that we should be asked not to accept the Bank's agency with a view to carrying on a continuation of their present business here. Even the desirability of our liquidating on behalf of the Bank is however at present uncertain, but we hope the Eoreign Office will since have explained their wishes to you in London. We informed Captain Lloyd that we are quite at his and the Government's disposal as regards this matter, and that we will act strictly in accordance with what ever wishes or instructions they express to you or to us* Capt* Lloyd has since left Jeddah, and we have been daily expecting a cable from you as to the arrangements made^in London between yourselves and the Foreign Office* We are still, however, without any news, and in the meantime the Bank's Manager here is pressing us almost daily to immediately commence taking over the Bank's assets. He understands from the Alexandria Office that all arrangements between yourselves and the Bank in London have oeen completed long ago* You will understand the difficulties of oui position as we cannot of course meet the local Manager's wishes and at the same time are not free to explain the position of af^cdrs to him* We are putting him off from day to day in the expectation of some news from you. TCe understand that among the matters the Bank wish us to take )ver is the collection of a debt of £.600 owing to them ’ey the ^edaan Igent of the Grand Sheriff. Our feeling is that Business of this nature would hardly tend to do us any good here, we even suggested to Captain Lloyd that perhaps the Best plan would Be for us to oaBle y r ou a recommendation to leave the Bank's Business altogether alone, out he considered it would Be preferaoleif weald nothing paving the whole matter to Be arranged Between yourselves and the toreignOffice We are of course unaware what you will decide with regard to the Hedjaz State Bank proposal, but if you take this matter up it will obviously be desirable that we have no connection whatever with the past or future business of the 1.0. Bank in Jeddah. On the other hand if the I.0.Bank has to be represented here the representation would presumabljr be better in our hands than in those of others.

Boulton Brothers to establish branches of their bank in Egypt and the East. 2. I am to state that the principal point upon which Mr. Balfour would be glad to be furnished with the observations of the India Office and of the Government of India is the proposal of the Bank to open at Jeddah. There would appear to be no objection to a branch of the bank being established in Egypt, but 4 Mr. Balfour understands that Messrs. Boulton Brothers are anxious to obtain something in the nature of a monopoly in banking in the Hedjaz, which as Mr. Chamberlain will appreciate is a very different matter.

Graham's note to Lord Hardinge explains itself. It will be remembered that the Foreign Office are informing the French Government, with our concurrence, (1) that His Majesty's Government adhere to the view that the Hejaz situation is 'not sufficiently secure to warrant the 'establishment there of a foreign bank, more especially in 'view of the suspicion with which any banking institution is 'regarded by Arab opinion'; and (2) that they regard the Sherif's action in closing the local branch of the Imperial Ottoman Bank, and in refusing to allow banking operations in the Hejaz,as 'perfectly justifiable'. In view of this pronouncement, the moment seems obviously inopportune for introducing a new British Banking interest in the person of Mr. Boulton; and it appears much the wiser course - as the Foreign Office propose* to encourage Gellatl^y Hankey and Company to carry on on existing lines, with a view to the gradual extension of their activities as circumstances permit. I feel some doubt, however, whether it is prudent to give the firm - as proposed in the draft - a 'clear understanding' that they are to be the future British Bank at Jeddah. This Office has always laid stress on the desirability of establishing a purely British Bank there, to the exclusion of French interests; and from that point of view the proposed 'understanding' is to be welcomed. But it is always possiole that we may not succeed in keeping the French out and may find ourselves compelled to agree to the establisnment of a Franco-British banking institution at Jeddah, and thus lay ourselves open to the charge of breaking faith with the firm. TheThe point is primarily one for the Foreign Office; hut it might perhaps be suggested to them that the draft should be ^modified as shown in pencil. Otherwise, I submit that we may concur. It seems unnecessary to require a formal letter from the Foreign Office. T.E-.S. 9 . 6. 1917. NOTE BY SIR THOLIAS H0LDERHE3S. DATED THE 11TH JUNE. 19 17 .

This is really a Foreign Office question and I am not disposed to express an opinion. 1st because I do not know what facilities G-ellatley Hankey and Company have 2nd because I have been associated with Messrs. Boulton before I took office and am now a small shareholder in the Alliance Bank of Simla which, I take it, would be part of their connection. But I doubt whether the Government ought to come under obligations to finvone as to the future. A C. 11. 6. 1917.mmReference Paper.

During the last ten yeers we have been teking adwanttga of tne undoubted opportunities open to London financial enterprises, in establishing connections in various parts of the world. In 1909 we were successful in obtaining tne Montenegrin Loan, which althoupjn only for the small amount of £200,000, was the first External Loan for that country. There was much competition from French and other houses for the lasue, tut with Russian and British support, this was overcome by us. The Loan was successfully placed on the London market, and, is all held in smell amounts by investors throughout tne United Kingdom. King Nicholas showed his appreciation of our services by conferring the Order of Danilo upon our Partners - the consent to this being given by His Majesty The King. About this time King Nicholas authorised Mr. Boulton to inform tne Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that he was willing to place under English control 'Die Higiit Honourable Lord Ha rdi nge, K. 0., P. C., Foreign Office, Whitehall, S.W. 1.control tne port of Cattero, to be used as a torpedo boat base. Kr. Eoulton accordingly did this, but the proposal was not acceptable to the English Govermient. The kontene^in Government iias been most correct in its subsequent dealings with our house, and the service of the Loan was only interrupted by the present war. In 1910 we were fortunate in obtaining a Charter from the Hussifin Govemnent for the establishing of 0 Joint Stock Bank in Petrogred, with ISnglish control of the capital. 'friis st(ip was taken on the report made by kr. Robert Boulton, of the astonishing fact that althou^ri there were Banks controlled by German, french and other forei.ji capital, there was no such corresponding English institution in Potrograd. This Bank was established and opened under t e name of the T hssian and Kngli sh Bank, Limited. Lord Balfour of Burleigh and the Right Honourable Austen Chamberlain, t.P., - the present Secretary of Ltate for India - were on the Council of the Bank, together with prominent Russian people. The Bank has done exceedingly well. Its resources have steadily grown, and its shares of Rts. 2f;C each ere now quoted at Rfcs. 40C to Rbs. bCC. In creating the Russirn and English Bank, arid thereby developing in a really practical form English enterprise in Russia, we venture to think that a critical time previous to the war we were pernops instrumental in assisting, however slightly, tne British Govern ent*s Russian policy. In 1913 we were successful in obtaining the City of Petro rad Loan of £2,300,000 - the first Loan to be introduced for that city on the London market. This wos accomplisned in the face of strong German competition, not mentioningIff Mntioning thst of on iSn^Lish proup who, ob ia well known, have been deairoue of upholding a monopoly of finsnciel operations in Russia against all other British houses. The Issue was s great success, and we received the congratulations of prominent City nouses. In 1914 w® issued a second Loan tor £2,2fc4,78C/, and although the outbreak of war caused the bonds to fall in price, with others of the same category, yet we are pleased to mention the fact that there were compensating Kxchangp profits on tne money remitted to Petrograd, Wl ‘ icil ■ ,,de the transaction financially satisfactory. „e have been indirectly instrumental in assisting m the development of v.ta.ble mining properties .hicn proved during thi. ..r of benefit to the Govermient. In October 1914 we made an Issue of £l,0C0,Q0o of London arid South Western Railway ^ Preference Stock, which was greatly over- subscribed. This was the first Isaue to be mode after the outbreak of war, and caused such favourable comiue.it both as to the terns and the way in which the Issue wpb handled. 4e have also carried through much satisfactory bisiness in Canada and Brasil, one of the most prominent brasilien transactions being tnat of tne Loan for £3,ouu,uu0 for the State of Rio de Janeiro - one of the few Brasilian Issues to continue paying its Coupon in case throughout this wer. We submit thst the above list of our more prominent transactions up to that date is convincing evidence of our enterprise and increasing success «°ngat British houses of finance. In Jnnu.ij 19H #r. Bob.rt Hpnlton pmeded to Indie, with toe object of reporting to our hone, on th.possibilities of Indinn Banking. After trnvellinr, ov&lt;&gt;r n ./rent pert of Indie, and meeting prominent business men, r, Boulton was so impressed with the possibilities of th«t vest country that he decidei after the most ceroful investigation to purchase a controlling interest in tne AlliaiKie Bank of Simla. Umited, for our house, thus developing the same policy successfully followed in Russia. Sir Louis Bane, after obtaining tne express approval of the India Office, accompenied V.r. Boulton's o«rty to India. The Allience Bank, established by Sir James .piker in 1074 - an entirely Kngliah institution - has had an exceptionally prosperous and steadily progressive career, and under the management of tne late Sir Arthur her, the Bank continued to advance in prosperity. In 1V14, aa your Lordship is aware, the Swadashi Banking crisis was ruining its course, and we were authoritatively informed that our advent into Banking circles in India was witnout doubt to a greet extent instrumental in terminating tne condition of affairs that threatened to subvert tne Banking poeition of . The Alliance Bank of Simla, Limited, was perhaps the only Bank in India that did not snow a loss in deposit money during this great crisis, not excepting the Presidency Banks, which sustained severs with’rewsla. Throughout-the North of India the requirements of the community were catered for by several small anka. n hia was naturally a weakness, and from the time e decided to co-operate with the Alliance Bank, it was air object to consolidate by amalgamation the Banking interests in Northern India, and so establish a strong institution. Although the “Aar has made very severe calls upon tha staffs both of our own and the Alliance Bank - 8&lt;&amp; o' our LondonLondon staff having volant^ f •nliatod - it has been found possible to put this policy into action, and the Alliance Bank has no* ebsorted the Punjab k.irloaipfry, Lirrited, tne Delhi and London Lank, Limited, the Bank of Upper India, . and has recently arrived at an agreement for the absorption of the Bank of Rangoon, the Alliance tnuo obtaining a footing in Bums* By the steps indicated *e have naturally been largely increasing tne Banking business of our house in London. The industrial development of Indie, as your Lordship is very fully aware, is now being energetically pushed, and we venture to believe that through our enlarged Banking arrangements we shell prove of substantial assistance in the Banking and finance necessary for this movement. The development of our Eastern business causes us to realise the necessity of our opening in Egypt, and when recently in Cairo, l r. Foul ton woe able to itiforn oir Reginald Wingate of his proposals for establishing the AlliaiiCe Bank of Egypt, Limited. It transpires tnat owing to the closing down of German Bankifig connections, such a bank s is oroposu; should ce able to create a good business. seeing that the ceuital of the Alliaiice Bank of Egypt will be held in equal parts by the Alliance Bank of Simla and our house, the institution should duly prove successful from its 'vide.ly establianed interests. In these circumstancea it is withev^ry confidence th fi t we ask your Lordship to extend your kind support in connection with the Alliance Bank of Egypt, and our opening at Jeddah and perhaps other places, when it is considered tne ript moment to do so. i»e fear that we have written your Lord snip at gr* at length, but in view of the greet importance to us of e full knowledgeknowledge of the fects being pieced before His ipjeRty*® Government, we trust you will forgive us doing so ty regarding this statement as a record for future reference. V.e have, &amp;c. (Signed) Boulton Bros, h Co.COPY OF MEMORANDUM SUPPLIED TO THE POLITICAL DEPARTMENT. The Alliance Bank of Simla is I believe quite a high class institution, I have not by me full particulars of its operations, but I find that it has paid dividends of 1($&gt; and upwards from 1884, the latest being 14^; has good names on its directorate. Its present capital is Rs. 80 lakhs authorised, Rs. 70 lakhs subscribed; Reserve Fund rs. 4o lakhs. Boulton Brothers work in close co-operation with the Alliance Bank for which they are the British Agents. They have lately been added to the very restricted list of- banks etc., which are allowed to apply (in their case up to ks.2 lakhs a week) for the Secretary of State’s Council drafts. But I hope that in the selection of a bank to be installed at Jeddah due consideration will be given to the rival claims of some of the large exchange banks doing business with India and the East. The National Bank of India, a very great concern, has a branch at Aden. The Eastern Bank has a branch at Basra and will probably soon have a branch at Bagdad. The Alliance Bank of Simla has, at present, no branch outside India and Kashmir. (3D.)

Cherchali, an Algerian Notable, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to inform you that he concurs in the terms of the Note which Lord Robert Cecil proposes to address to the French Ambassador in regard to that portion of M. Cherchali’s instructions which relates to the Jeddah branch of the Imperial Ottoman Bank. ******* I have etc., (Sipaied) A. Hirtzel. Under Secretary of State. Foreign Office.EXTRACT- F ROM LF/fTER FROM F OREIGN OFFICE TO. .HIDU L^mCE DATED 30th May 1917 FOREIGN OFFICE Sir 30th May 1917• * / * * * * Lord Robert Cecil considers that the opportunity should be taken of rebutting this view and of placing Franco-British relations in Arabia and the Hedjaz on a definite and satisfactory footing. He would therefore suggest that the whole question should be carefully examined by the competent Departments of His Majesty’s Government,and he would be glad in the first instance to be favoured with the views of Mr Chamberlain as to the line on which a reply to the French Notes should be concevied in order that no misunderstanding may be allowed to subsist as to the position and intentions of the His Majesty’s Government ir/Arabian peninsula. In view, however, of the fact that Monsieur Cherchali has been instructed to asso^ciate His Majesty’s Government in a representation he will address to King Hussein regarding the closing of the branch of the Ottoman Bank at Jeddah and that he is reported by Sir R. Wingate to have already arrived in Dgyptt, Lord Robert Cecil considers that an interim reply should be returned to Monsieur Cambon at once in regard '00 these representations, and that early considerations should then be given to the question whether His Majesty’s Government should now lay down the principle that the only Bank at Jeddah is to be a British Bank, and whether or not immediate steps should be taken to cause such a Bank to be established. ****** I am etc (Signed) W. Langley. Under Secretary of State. India OfficegTRACT FRO M FCHEION OFFICE DR APT ?!QTE TO FRENCH A. Tr BASSATX)R DATt^D May 1917 . &lt;f A In view, however, of the fact that M. Cherchali is being instructed to associate His Majesty’s Government in a representat to King Hussein with regard to the closing of the branch of the Imperial Ottoman Bank at Jeddah, it is desirable that Your Excellency should be in a position to inform your Government with - out delay of the attitude of His Majesty’s Government in this matter. In Lord Grey’s Note of the 10th of November last the opinion was expressed that the situation in the Redjaz was not sufficiently secure to warrant the establishment there of a foreign bank, more especially in view of the suspicion with which any banking institution is regarded by Arab opinion. His Majesty’s Government do not feel that circumstances in the Hedjaz have altered in suc£i a way as to cause them to modify the view expressed in Lord Grey’s above-mentioned Note; they consider that the action taken by King Hussein, in refusing to allow banking operations in the Hedjaz, and in closing the branch of the Ottoman Bank was perfectly justifiable and they regret, therefore, that they are unable to associate themselves with the representation which M. Cherchali is instructed to make to the King under this head. I may add that His Majesty’s Government would in any case be unwilling to support the claim of the Imperial Ottoman Bank, in whatever form that Bank were constituted to trade in the Hedjaz, where its antecedents and relations render it am object of suspicion and unsuitable for consucting business with King Hussein and the Arabs.7TO,i ?Wk SIR R. WINOATR CAIRO TO FORFJO-N OFFICE DATP^D 29th May 1917 . Instructions then proceed to examine question of establishment of a Franco-British Bank at Jeddah, and the Sherif is to be informed of the 'painful impression*' which his refusal to permit the reopening of a Branch of the Imperial Ottoman Bank has made on the 'French and British Governments', and he is to l?e urged to revoke this decision which must be due to 'a misunderstanding'. Full text of these Notes will follow by bag, but it is clear that French now desire to limit their recognition of our special position in Arabia to an admission of our preponderant com ercial interests. I consider that a very explicit reply should be returned to these Notes and I should be glad to receive your observations as to the line which such a reply should follow I am consulting the India Office in the same sense. Meanwhile I am informing French Ambassador that we will send a full reply in due course to the general issues raised in his Notes, but that as regards the Ottoman Bank we are still of opinion that the opening of a Bank in the Hedjaz would for the present be undesirable and that King Hussim's attitude has been perfectly jusitfiable that we cannot therefore allow ourselves to be associated with Cherchali's representations in the matter, and that in any case we would be unwilling to support the claim of the Imperial Ottoman Bank, in whatever form that Bank were constituted, to trade in the Hedjaz. You should inform Colonel Wilson how matters stand and thus enable him to prevent Cherchali creating misconceptions in King Hussim's mind about the Ottoman Bank.[ This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should be returned to the Foreign Office when done with unless required for official use.] •n ■ I 1 ± o:m Decypher. 3ir 'A.

We consider that our policy should be (1) elimination of French claims calculated certainly to lead later to political complications; (2) eventual establishment of purely British bank which should bo substantial bank with Indian connections in interest of pilgrim traffic and Indian trade such as National Bank of India with'its Indian, Aden, and Fast African connections. To this end Sherif should be induced to close down at once Ottoman Bank, which should not be resuscitated in any form whatever. If French Government can be induced voluntarily to withdraw their claim, there would appear to be no obstacle in the way of immediate establishment openly of British bank since SheriT is agreeable. If, however, French will not withdraw claim, we see no object in attempting to secure a footing through thin disguise of a trading firm such as Cowasjee Dinshaa&gt; ( and think best course would be to get Sherif to refuse to allow any banking business at all for the present. Time might mollify French attitude, and in view of previous correspondence with French Government of local Islamic prejudice and of uncertainty ol military situation, there would appeal to be no urgency. If, however, it is decided to employ Cowasjee Dinsluu^C, who are respectable linn, it should be clearly laid down that arrangement is temporary, and give them no claim to subsequent banking monopoly.(jfis k/u yy (This Document is the Property ot His Britannic Majesty's Government, and should be returned to the Foreign Office when done with unless required (or official use.] D^cy r::- . ^4. riy^ QKLY ...ir (Caipo)^ Feb. j). 3,10,p.n.

The Ihereef is aware that the lank has French and ' ritish interests, but has to consider man ner in which this la;ik is regarded by public in Hedjaz, The Bhereef has privately expressed his willingness J“| to have a British lan]&lt; in Hedjaz, but will not consider •allowing any other nation to establish a bank for the present. Should Shereef take such action I should consider it very undesirable that any protest should be mode by for I an confidant that ra can best assist Shereef -J interfering as little as possible with internal af fairs i •‘z at present, I furth r consider that suchsuch get ion on hi^s port 'voulci solve msny future diffi culties; for so lo;ig ss Ottoran Bsnk is there vvo shall he continually confronted with difficulties which unless arrested now will seriously prejudice our future influ ence in the country, and if allowed to grow will cer tainly he cause of friction with French later on, A firm attitude now my dispose of this question. It is possible however that Shereef may not take action described. Since recommendation made by Captain Lloyd in paragraph 10 of his letter of November 24th, last he informs me that he thinks a stronger firm with wider business connexions should now be chosen. In spite of Shereef’s willingness to accept a British Bank it is probably undesirable in view of French suspepti- bilitics to introduce one at the moment, I am however making private enquiries as to whether Captor(sic) Cowasji Dinshaw of Aden would not open a branch of their business et Jeddah and undertake banking operations. They might I believe be relied on to act in harmony with British and Indian interests, they have 9 wide connexion with Fed Sea trade a-id they would have further advantage of entering Nedja.z as a native rather than as a European firm.. Addressed to Foreign Office,Mr. Oliphant, I can S 0 e no objection to the diraft letter and telegram, and we will ask the Government of India to expedite their reply to our despatch of 1st December last, and to make some definite proposal. For this purpose will you please let me have a copy of your telegramt to Sir R. Wingate as soon as it has issued. There seems to be an impression in the Foreipn Office that India is in some way responsible for the policy of keeping the Ottoman Bank out, and is showing negligence in not proposing a substitute, May I remind you that Sir M. de Bunsen 1 s letter of 17th October 1916 to Lord Bessborougb was written without reference to us, and before we appeared on the scene at a 11° So too the note to M. Gambon of 10th November 1916. It was not till the F.O. had Captain Lloyd's views, and the Sirdar's concurrence in them, that they consulted us at all viz. 23rd November 1916 (7/.231046), when Lord Grey expressed a preference for not raising the issue at that moment, and suggested as a oossible eventual solution a French bank in Syria, e British bank in Mesopotamia, and a combination of the two in the Hejaz. But in any case no bank was to be established at Jeddah until the Shereef expressed a desire for one. w e concurred provisionally, suggesting that the British bank might be the Easterns, but promising a final opinion after ^consulting the Government of India (30th November 1916). ” r e did not suggest tha.t the Eastern Bank should op°n a branch at Jeddah; but that it should be the Bank to combine with a French Banik, if the Foreign Office's solution were adopted ~ and that because it is the official British bank in Mesopotamia. But I gather that this solution is no longer favoured, and certainly we s lould prefer a purely British bank.&lt;4* 0 .$y* b?

I sincerely hope that it will be possible, without giving cause of offence to our Allies, to arrange for a purely British concern to undertake Banking business at Jeddah. I shall oe in a better position to put forward nn; 1 proposals in this connection after my arrival at Cairo. Yours very sincerely, (tigned) F..V.ingate. T he Right Honourable ' The Viscount Grey of Fallodon. K.G., Foreign Office. LONDON.Extract from a private letter dated November 24th, 1916, From Captain George Lloyd (Jeddah) to H/E.the Governor General. 'mom t m- :. The position is that the Ottoman Bank is still technically open here, but does practically no business • It has probably suffered loss, for it is likely that the Turks when they evacuated, did what they did at Basra, which was to take all the cash and leave a mere receipt behind. Its lack of business is probably partly due to the dislike oi the inhabitants of the Syrian manager, but still more to the fact that the Shereef has so far afforded it no kind of recognition or support. You will by now ha.ve got a copy of Bremond’s original message to the Shereef, the gist of which Wilson telegraphed to you while I was at Khartoum. The original is important because it discloses clearly what the French are after. They probably wish to acquire the position of bankers * to the Shereefian Govt, and to get the Shereef to appoint and recognise a French bank for that purpose. In Bremond’s message trie Ottoman Bank is sometimes referred to a.s a French concern and sometimes as a. French English concern, cut it is noticeable that^when the new bank which he proposes is mentioned 4ha.t no mention is made of the English aspect of the case. Once the Shereef f s recognition were obtained, the uan k would be in a major position to arrange for th© mintage/ov mintage of a new currency, a.nd they would naturally try to get this established in units familiar to French trade, i.e. decimal equivalents. This would not assist our Indian trade now accustomed to a rupee ba.sis. The French bank would also naturally encourage the Shereef to borrow money Iron the Bank and to give him facilities for so doing upon such security as he could offer necessarily upon revenues or some form of internal property. Much as the Shereef might dislike the idea of a French bank at first, the temptation of loans given at first upon favourable terms would be great and •• facile descensus Averni. This is obviously one of the points where economics become politics and where by methods of trade political hold and influence may be, and constantly is acquired. In this connection there!ore it may be pertinent to recollect the terms under which the French Mission came here. These are to be read in a telegram from F.O. to the High Commissioner, No.736 of September 13th. The first paragraph of which runs as follows:- g understand that Colonel Bremond has been officially instructed by ohe French Government that whilst acting cpmpietely in accord with the British authorities in Cairo as far as rendering them all possible fl RS ') stnnnp cnH -Pq/^■»* 1 i Arburs telegram No.1275 of August 28th gives the aims of the mission and its limitations in further detail. It seems to me that the step should be resisted. At the same time I am most fully aware that it is. of the highest importance that no causes of friction between our selves and our allies should be allowed to arise. I think however that this project could be nipped in the budbud without any fear of friction. But for this purpose to be achieved it is essential that the F.O. should not actually encourage it in London and Paris or put forward proposals for joint action. So long as they take no action the matter should be easy. It is clear from the terms of Colonel Bremond’s message that the French recognize the difficulty of openly asking lor a commercia,! privilege in an area in which they have no concerns of this kind, and that they therefore want the Shereef to take the initiative by inviting them to open a French Bank upon which they could gracefully accede e,nd we could say nothing. On the ether hand, the Shereef has no anxiety to see this happen and has put them off so far by saying that he coulu discuss it when he came to Jeddah. I fancy that Wilson could convey unofficially to the Shereef’s mind that we see no advantage in the opening of a French bank at the moment, and that would be sufficient. He could then reply to the French courteously that while he looked for ward to opening the country after the war to many forms of new enterprise for the moment he did not want to see new foreign firms or even the appearance of such entering the Hejas. After some small delay we could get to work ourselves. I think the best way to establish a bank would^ oe to use G-allatly Hankeys for the purpose. They are already here and know the place. If they were encouraged to make an extension of their business in a banking direction I think it is probable they would do so. They are already familiar with the specie business which is to-day the most important financial business to be done and would probably take up other forms of banking businessli encouraged to do so. Gradually they could separate their conking business, begun in their present premises, to a separate house, under plea of a mere extension of ousiness and then open the new house definitely as a bank under their own or a new name• In order to get hold of the Ehereef's business,we might pay his monthly grant into Gellatly Hankeys 'bank' ; nu he could cy drawing a cheque get what sums he wanted. Mien he saw the facility that this offered and the security 01 having his money safely housed near the sea m rntish hands, he would probably more and more make use of it for himself and his Government funds. These tunds plus the specie business would give the Bank a good start and also give us a good grip on affairs. Such is my suggestion. The more instant thing is to get the Shereef to refuse the French suggestion and men there will be time to consider the above suggestion, or any other.j i orn a private letter dated Eovernber 24th, 191c irora Captain George Lloyd (Jeddah) to H.S. the Governor General. 'gttc.l.;. PHI'.) u: igpv; 1 ihere has been some slight confusion I think in the correspondence between the Ottoman Public Debt and the Ottoman Bank. They are quite separate and distinct. When Turkey, somewhere about 1670, I think, first iounu herself unable to meet the interest upon certain of her foreign loans contracted with England, France and others, a coranittee was formed of the Foreign Bondholders concerned for the protection of their interests. Pressure was brought to bear upon Turkey by the Governments concerned vadi the result that Turkey hypothecated certain specified revenues to the service of the loans. These are known as the 'ceded revenues'. An administration was formed to collect them and administer them called the Ottoman Public Dect Administration,_and it had offices in every vilayet of the Turkish Empire for the collection of the ceded re\t-.nu , Aghnam (sheep) sa.lt tax etc. This adrninistra.tion also acquired great hold over the Turkish Government in virtue oi one of its provisions which forbad the Turkish Government to increase the scale of its import duties without the permission of the Ottoman Public Debt. ihe Shereef 1 s action complained of is in respect to the Jeddah branch of this administration and in the seizure oi its lands such ^s they were. ihe Shereef would obviously be unwise in his own interestinterest to run up against the Ottoman debt and risk alienating the sympathies of his allies. As to whether his action is actually illegal it is much harder • -or nos that the Hejas no longer belongs to Turkey the position of the Debt administration in it certainly becomes questionable. The same question is to be met with in other occupied territories of the Ottoman Empire. Doubtless if Russia takes over Armenia, “ rIK ' e * sna England Mesopotamia we shall each of us make ourselves responsible for the annual payment to the bondholders of a sum equivalent to the value of the ceded revenues in the occupied territories. But until such a settlement after the war, the matter is rather one of expediency than right, and doubtless the uhereef wi^l gee it that way once he understands the metter.'fThis Document is the Property ot His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should be returned to the Foreign Office when done with unless required for official ase/| 5090 1916 J mm L/V POLITICAL Decypher of tele 0 run from the Dirdar (Khartoum).

Imncrial Ottoman Bank. Sir, I bog to rofor to tho conToreation I had the honour of having with you thio forenoon* The Branch of the Imperial Ottoman Bank at Jeddah was opened in Mareh 1913* From the date of its inaugura*- tion till the Turke declared War on the Allies it carried on transactions normally* On War being declared, most of the Staff (with one or two exceptions Syrian Christians) were forced to Join the Turkish Army*and although the Bank remained open, practically no business transactions could be undertaken* Some time after the surrendering of Jeddah to the Forces of the Grand Sherif, our Manager there was authorise o{ to proceed to kgypt to report to our London Committee and eventually receive their instructions as to the future management of his Branch* In the course of his report the Manager drew the attention of our London Committee to the fact that not* withstanding the good will of H*H* the Grand Sherif, the Bank, as well as its Staff, personally, would be exposed to serious embarassment and even danger in such a fanati cal Mahomaedan country if they continued to be subject to the Charleh Law, and he therefore suggested that in consideration of this and the large (almost complete) Allied interest in the Bank and its great utility to Bjeddah His Excellency Sir H*nry M*M»hon, G.C.V.O., K.C.I.i., C.S.X.,Djtddah, our London Coowittoo should ondoarour to haro tho protection of one of the Allied Powers extended to thaw* It ie for this reason that Lord Beeeborough 9 our Chairman 9 sent ae the telegraa which I had the honour of eoamunleating to you 9 Sir, this forenoon and in which he requested as to solicit your assistance and adrlee* You were good enough to take an interest in the question and said you would cojoaunleate with the British Agent at jeddah with regard thereto* 1 trust that the fere going explanation will suffice to enable you to do so* Thanking you, Sir, for the kind consideration you hawo shown the Bank in tho matter, X hare the honour to be.

The question of the iaaunlty of foreigners from lo cal jurisdiction has not been raised locally as yet but it is one which requires early consideration both on account of tho nustber of British protece\d subjoota already in tho coun try and of tho foreign influx which will gradually take place. Tho Manager of tho Imperial Ottoman Bank has alrea dy antlolpatod trouble and suggested either that tho Jeddah Branch of his Bank should be offered protection by one of the Allied Powers or that a local bank should be founded under a new naae and presumably under British or other Alllel- registration. The cases of fioumania and Servia may bs cited as useful precedents in eonsldering the question. As provincss at first and than as States dependent on Turkey they were subjectsubject to the Capitulation*, and wfean their independence the vae acknowledged b//Treaty of Berlin, it wae specially provided in the Treaty that the foreign lomunitie* should be continued* It will be still sore neeessary to insist on similar safeguards in $he Hedja* where the administrators of the Sharia Law are without experience of modern European conditions and handicapped by an ignorance which may become dangerous through fanaticism* Ho legal machinery, however, exists at Jeddah to ensure such privileges and until some system is established, the Sharia Law must continue to ope rate* Two courses are open: the first is to come to a full a and lasting understanding with the Sherif regarding the rights of Allied and Allied Protected Subjects and to set up consular courts in order to put them into effect; the sec* ond is to devise some makeshift system which will be pure^ ly temporary in character^but will ensure that justice is done* The first course is open to several objections* The Sherif*e position is as yet by no means secure nor is his Government sufficiently established to justify any lasting arrangement being made at present* And further the establish ment of a property constituted British Consular Court would pave the way to the advent of Consuls of other Allied nation who have bsen discouraged hitherto on the plea of the un settled condition of the country*. A more satisfactory and less obtrusive solution appears to be to ask the Sherif, in return for the many bene fits conferred on him by Great Britain, to delegate to Colo nel Wilson or his representative the authority to settle all caeca, civil or criminal in which British or British protected subjects are concerned J whether between themsel ves or with natives of the country or with subjectsof othtr nations. His authority might evsn bs further exten* ded to inelude subjeets of any Allied nation mho were not represented at Jeddah and eho wioh to aTail themselTss of it in preference to the Sharia Lae. It is probable that the French Government which is represented at Jeddah by the French Military Mission would insist on similarly delegated powers with regard to thslr own subjscts and to ttyis no objection can be made. At the same time it would be desirable to inform the Sherif that the requeet for this personal delegation of Jurisdiction was purely s temporary measure pending final settlement at a more convenient opportunity. As regard the case of the Imperial Ottoman Banfc, it appears that this Bank, though largely controlled by Allied interests, ill a Turkish institution and that thsre- fors the status of its Branch at Jeddah must be definitely changed before any protection can be afforded to it. This would seem to involve altering the status of the bank as a whole and if such s sten is not regarded favourably it would appear desirable to adopt the suggest ion of the Manager of the Alexandria branch and establish a local bank with a new name which could take over the con nection of the Imperial Ottoman Bank and be registered in the name of one of the Allied Powers. This would protsct the interests of the bank as an institution but would not safeguard those of the staff in their private capacities. The obvious solution to this is for ths bank to send only subjects of Aomc Allied Power to represent them at Jeddah. (signed) K.CORNWALLIS.

Lord Grey considers that, in view of the correspondence which has already passed between His Majesty f s Government and the French Government in the matter, it will be' preferable to defer raising this issue for the present and to wait until the matter has been given further careful consideration. An eventual solution might perhaps be found in some arrangement whereby a purely British official Bank would be established in Mesopotamia and the zone marked 'B' in the recent Asiatic Agreement, and a purely French official Bank in Syria and zone ‘’A”, and it could be provided that when the moment arrives for introducing a Bank into the Hedjaz, this Bank should represent a really equal combination of the above two Banks rather than a reconstitution of the Imperial The Under Secretary of State, India Office .Imperial Ottoman Bank with its associations, at least in so far as Arab opinion is concerned, with the Turkish regime. Lord Grey considers that in any case no Bank should he established at Jeddah until the Sherif expresses a desire for the presence of such an institution. I am to request that you will lay the above considerations and suggestions before Mr. Chamberlain and that the opinion of the Government of India may be ascertained on the question.

In absence of any recent or reliable statistics on trade of Jeddah, he cannot speak with confidence as to opportunities which that place oifers at the moment for operations of a Bank but thinks it probable that there is scope for a Bank and that the facilities which it would offer would not only be timely but appreciated by local- inhabitants and Authorities, Moslem religious y objections to banking he considers to be more technical than real, for Arabs not only in ngypt but in Syria and Mesopotamia freely avail themselves of British and other banking facilities and often prefer them to methodsmsthods of native noneylonclorg doth for deposit and ad vance purposes. In support of this he instances the success obtained tty Eastern lan 1 : in Mesopotamia doth prior to and during the war, I can also confirm this in regard to appreciation of National Nank of Egypt dy natives of Soudan where several tranches are establish^ edr whilst this is so, he is much inclined to deprecate introduction of Ottoman Sank, either under its own or any other name, into Hedjaz, He points out while some portion of Bank’s capital and direction-ef- personnel is certainly British, it is wellknown its activities have for a long time past teen engaged in furthering French economic and political business rather than British and that it has also at times been involved in undesirable forms of cosmopolitan finance. Establishment also named would not therefore alter it’s methods. An examination moreover of this Bank’s affairs and books which he recently made at Basrah confirms him in this view. He further points out any Bank operating at Jeddah would be necessarily in close relations with the Shereef and notables of Mecca and submits that it is in conse quence very important, from a political point of view, that if any Bank be established there it should be of highest reputation, unconnected with abuses of Turkish j regime and if possible an entirely British concern* The matter has, he thinks, unusual importance from fact thatthat one 3 established, Bank would inevitably have much t-; do with pilgrim traffic in future and would have communications with Moslem over an increasingly wide spread area, an aspect of the question which cannot fail to concern His Majesty's Governments He has also called my attention to more purely economic side of the subject which refers to two main points, first importance of Manchester Cotton trade in Red Sea, and secondly, question ox currency, both cog nate to this question, consideration of both of which confirms him in his general reluctance to see any other than a British bank in so delicate a place as Jeddah, Captain Lloyd's Banking experience and personal knowledge of Ottoman Bank methods lend weight to his views which coincide generally with my own.[ This Document is the Property ot HU Britannic Majesty*!
