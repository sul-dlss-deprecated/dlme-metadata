Position has since developed as follows Triumvirate visited me together on the night of 6th April to say that the Shah had sent for Akbar Mirza that morning to discuss the situation further. In doing, so, he had confirmed rriore decidedly the assurance which he had previously given Prime Minister to the effect that he intended to fall in with our views, and said that Cabinet had better formulate definite proposals in consultation with me and show them to him before he gave me an audience. Triumvirate went on to express the view that the Shah, having been driven by our explicit intimation to face problem squarely, and having now definitely brought himself to decide upon policy of exclusive recourse to us, but having at the same time renounced his proposed journey to Europe, it was urgently necessary to clinch matter at once lest other influences should get to work on him. They accordingly proposed that an agreement in general terms should be drawn up forthwith. In my following telegrams I communicate for your consideration, with brief explanatory comment, the drafts of a deed of agreement and a confidential subsidiary agreement framed in terms in which triumvirate make their proposal, and on basis on which they believe business can be put through. They ask for certain assurances regarding the Shah and themselves, which I will deal with separately. Subject to your concurrence, the idea is that, on signature of these instruments, Mushaver will be informed that a definite understanding has been come to with Great Britain, and that his mission is consequently finished, except in so far as it may be necessary or desirable to keep him for any work in connection with the League of Nations as distinct from Peace Conference.

No comment. Article 2. 1 wanted to say that powers of the advisers should be matter for agreement between the two Governments, but they said that they would have great difficulty in getting that through, if explicitly stated, and argued that, as His Majesty s Government would not allow advisers to accept terms which they did not themselves approve, result was the same. Secondly, I wished to add a clause under which Persia undertook not to go elsewhere for advisers or loans. They objected to this on the ground that wording was the same as that of a certain Russian ultimatum, and would not be accepted in so many words As regards advisers, we endeavoured to get round Ameer by saying we will supply “such expert advisers as may be necessary, 5 ’ it being quashed that none are necessary from other sources. You may prefer to say “ all such expert advisers.” As regards borrowing, they urge that, if we are running their finances, we obviously shall not agree on loans from other quarters. Articles 3, 4, and 5. No comment. Article 6. Wording seems sufficiently innocuous and vague, but His Majesty’s Government may wish to improve upon it. Article 7. Of course Persia’s main object in revision is to obtain more revenue. Article 8. They are very anxious that this should be inserted in order to captivate public sentiment. (Sent to India.) JL No. 5.

As regards (a\ your telegram No. 142 gave me to understand that on hypothesis that no bill was presented against us, you would be prepared in principle, to assist Persia in the matter at an opportune moment.

A . . -n • , , , As regards (6) I am well aware, and so is Cabinet, that 1 ersia has taken no part in connection’with war which would make her at all deserving of an increase of territory; but position is that we are anxious to carry through successtully deal with Persia, which is very important m the interest of botn countries, and in our own interests we must give Cabinet as much material as we can oi a nature calculated to facilitate their efforts to get &gt; through without much opposition. There is no way in which we can Halter her vanity or earn her goodwill, as being her sincere champion, more than by getting a bit of territory for her - and though I know primd fade views of His Majesty s Government on the subject, I nevertheless venture to make following suggestions m case any of them may point to a means to humour Persia without serious prejudice to other i ii terests * * * 1 Alone Turco-Persian frontier from Mandali [?] northward investigation may indicate some tract in which for ethnological or other reasons a small bit of territory might be left to Persia-for instance, round Zohab or m neighbourhood ‘f Kotur where Boundary Commission left gap in their delimitation.

My hrsi impressions are that the general agreement (your telegram No. 258) will prove acceptable, subject to insertion in paragraph 2 of words “ all sucb expert advisers. ’ Question whether Financial Adviser ought to be in service of His Majesty’s Govern ment isalso one for consideration, and I am consulting Treasury. Your telegram No. 259. In view of strong feeling against secret agreements, it would appear desirable, if anything is to be done on these points, to embody it in subsequent letter to Minister. His Majesty’s Government would like further time to consider (a) and (h). (a) would need addition of such words as “ if and when opportunity offers.” Colonel Wilson is being consulted about the frontier. His Majesty’s Government could not commit themselves to maintenance in perpetuity of Kajar dynasty, or to subsidy to Shah, which would amount at present rate to 120,000b a year. , . . 11 i m If Persian finances are properly administered rise m revenue would benenciaily afi'ect civil list of Sovereign. ,, \ , i i Further payment of 500,000 tomans would, if ever approved, have to be merely an advance out of any prospective loan.

Fending final conclusions, following observations are prompted by your telegram. It is not] Persian Government [? who] desire items (a) and (b) to be secret. They would of course welcome their inclusion in principal agreement. If compact between ourselves and Persian Government, in fir-&gt;t clause of (a), would be considered “ unholy ” if published, perhaps the understanding could be arranged by exchange of letters and only last clause, beginning with “ British Government,” come into agreement. Rather than make addition which you suggested I think it would be a more acceptable alternative if words “ will do their best ” were substituted for “ will undertake.’ Life of present monarch is not likely to be a long one owing to his increasing obesity. As regards “ dynasty,” would it be possible to say “Shah and his successors will have our friendly support [? as long asj, M &amp;c., or that “we will not support any change of dynasty as long as ” ? As regards 500,000 tomans. If advanced out of a loan it would be much less palatable, because item would have to appear in Government accounts, which would be inconvenient to parties whose palms were greased. Perhaps it would be possible to [? make] Anglo-Persian Oil Company agree and get them to share it. In case of item which offers difficulty a diluted form would be preferable to complete rejection. (Sent to India.) No. 2. Sir P. Cox to Earl Curzon. — (Received April 20, 5‘30 p.m.) Tehran, April 19, 1919. (No. 296. Most Urgent.) (April 19, 115 a.m.) PRIME MINISTER informs me last telegram from Mushaver, dated 16th April, is to the following effect:— ' “It is expected peace with Germany will be signed 25th April. After that, question of [? Adriatic I and Italy’s claims will be taken up [? and whether] they could be [group undecypherable] to T? Supreme Council] after Adriatic had been dealt with, question of Persia would be taken up by Conference. Since hearing this he had called on I&gt;ord Hardinge and enquired to what extent Persia might hope for British support at the Conference. Lord Hardinge replied amount of British support depended on results of deliberations now proceeding between British Minister and Persian Gov.ern- ment. . . “ Mushaver asked to be informed at once of details of these [? negotiations]. “Prime Minister will delay reply for fwo or three days, in case you wish to suggest any particular course, otherwise he will reply negotiations are connected with questions of advisers regarding which Mushaver has been already informed. Prime Minister enquired whether His Majesty’s Government proposed to inform I ramee and America of the nature of contemplated agreement before the fact, or when it was a fait accompli. “ I replied that His Majesty’s Government might be depending on me to take whichever course was wisest in our joint interests. “ Owing to letters now beginning to arrive from [? Mushaver or to leakage of his telegrams] an assiduous amount of gossip is being generated by interested elements taking sides. I can hardly credit statement as to early discussion of Persian affairs at Peace Conference, and I should be glad to learn whether there is any foundation for it.” [1867] JBEarl Curzon to Sir P. Cox (Tehran). (No. 234. Confidential. Urgent.) Foreign OJJicey April 23, 1919, 2‘30 F.m, YOUR telegrarii No. 293 of 19th April: Negotiations with Persian Government On point 1 I agree to substitution of words “His Majesty’s Government will do their best ” as urged by you. As regards the life of the Shah, we should not, I fear, be justified in gambling on the eventuality anticipated by you. His Majesty is at present receiving a considerable sum from us so long as he gives his loyal support to Vossugh-ed-Dowleh. As 1 pointed out in my telegram No. 225, if Persian finances are administered better tins will redound to his benefit. British public opinion would, 1 feel convinced, raise grave objection to paying the subsidy mentioned in your telegram No. 2G2. While, therefore I regret necessity of raising objection to the alternatives put forward by you, 1 shall be glad to receive any other suggestion which you can make on the subject. With regard to the dynasty, I agree to wording “ Shah and his successors will have our friendly support ” on the conditions already specified. 1 assume that vou consider this phraseology more palatable to His Majesty than the alternative which you gave. As regards question of 500,000 tomans, there is difficulty in suggesting to Anglo- Persian Oil Company their participation in the matter. The company are at present endeavouring to acquire a vast monopoly in the shape of a concession for railway construction over the major part of Persia, llis Majesty’s Government, on the other hand, are not yet convinced that it is in general British interest that this concession should materialise. In these circumstances we might be embarrassing ourselves by making any such suggestion to the company. Now that there is no longer a vote of credit, any financial advance of the magnitude suggested would have to be borne on a parliamentary vote, and be subjected to a more careful scrutiny than would perhans be the case in the Persian Ministry of Finance..

I am not quite clear as to whether His Majesty’s Government still wish subjects of clauses (-a) and (6), to be secret, and separately treated by exchange of letters, or whether it is con-udered that they can be altered in form so as to come into principal document. As regards clause (a), I will try [Palter] words “will do their best.” As regards (5), I await further communication. My telegram No. 262. I hope.that dynastic clause may be settled by use of alternate wording approved by you. Failing that, I will try my second suggestion. As regards subsidy to Shah,' duration of Vossuk-ed-Dowleh’s incumbency is, of course, uncertain. Would it be possible to continue subsidy for, say, ten years, and add following reservation, beginning “or until such time as improved administration has increased total revenue by double amount of subsidy ” ? Present subsidy is only about 10,0001. per annum. Telegrams Nos. 263 and 263 a. In last resort, I think that payment would be accepted as an advance on account of loan, presuming that (': Persian Ministers] will be instructed not to probe item. If the above solution proves difficult, would His Majesty s Government be prepared to give half amount as a present ? Or can you devise any means by which payment of an extra month of monthly subsidy of 350,000 tomans could be arranged for this purpose ? I cannot at present suggest any.

(Repeated to '1'eh ran.) (Received January 30, 10'30 a.m.) (Secret * PERSIA. Cox’s telegram No. 24 of 13th January, and Lord Curzon’s telegram of 23rd January. With Cox’s central proposal we are in full sympathy. Financial reform is the all quo of Persia regeneration. British financial control would be line of least resistance to that permanent maintenance of British influence which is the guiding principle of His Majesty’s Government’s Persian policy. (.’ox’s full programme of reform, however is so thorough that it may well prove too strong meat even for ultra pro-British triumvirate in the Cabinet. In any case, as we know from experience pro-British optimism of men so bound up with us as Vossuk and the sons of Zill and F. F. are a very uncertain barometer of public opinion. In a matter of such moment we cannot afford a repetition on a large scale of our experience over the South Persia Rifles where recognition of the South Persia Rifles by Vossuk was closely followed by his downfall, and repudiation of his recognition by successive cabinets contributed greatly to our troubles in South Persia. It is not enough that the proposed reforms would be readily acceptable to the [? present] Cabinet; it is essential that they should run so little counter to public opinion that the present Cabinet will be able to carry them into effect, and that their successors in office will accept them as a matter of course. To us this appears a very large assumption—the recent changes for better in public opinion notwithstanding. Indeed it is only if Cox’s programme is whittled down to what is absolutely [? essential] that it seems to us to hold out hope of enduring success. If then British financial control is to be our first aim we should not hesitate to jettison a good deal of the scheme to secure it. In particular we doubt wisdom of pressing an elaborate network of British advisers on the various departments. This would savour too much of the Egyptian model [? and might] raise cry that our ultimate goal in Persia is the goal we have reached in Egypt. Given financial control and the resultant increase in Minister’s influence the utmost that would seem necessary would be the introduction (provided this can be readily secured) of an adviser in some department where his presence is palpably desirable for the success of financial reform. W e are, for similar reasons, sceptical of the wisdom of British advisers in each major jjrovince. It is not clear whether Cox intends them to supplement or supersede our consuls. If the former, there w'ould be ample opportunities for friction between consul and adviser (witness the recent case of Gough and Sykes); if the latter, we should be laying ourselves open to the charge (not merely in Persia, but in England and the world at large) of treating Persia as a British protectorate. Here again, given British financial control and the Minister’s predominant influence in Tehran, a reasonable measure of control of provincial Governors could surely be exercised adequately and in a manner far less galling to Persian susceptibilities by our consuls. Most difficult of all is the problem of the officering of uniform force. On the one hand our experience of foreigners has been unfortunate; their ways with Orientals aie not our wa\ s , friction with us, even though we controlled purne-strings, would be almost inevitable; intrigues against us the reverse of improbable. On the other hand there is probably nothing that would contribute more to Persia’s acceptance o. Coxs scheme and to a genuine change of general attitude towards us, than our acquiescence in the officering from non-British sources, whereas rigid insistence on British officers (especially in the face of our published engagements regarding the couth Persia Rifles) might give opposition a weapon wherewith to wreck whole scheme. In our opinion, predominant British influence at the Cabinet and British control of pay would put us in a strong enough position to be able to afford officering by some selected foreign State politically harmless both to Persia and ourselves (say I rench Switzerland) merely reserving to ourselves an officer at each headquarters (preferably as the Persian general military as well as financial adviser) to control financial arrangements. Should, however, His Majesty’s Government decide to negative foreign officers then we suggest instruction and guidance essential for the Persian uniform force might be supplied by means of a military instructional mission under British leadership, and composed of British officers, though we need not object to inclusi isionof a few acceptable neutral officers in subordinate positions, if we could not keep whole mission British. \\ e understand Persia at present contemplates a uniform force of 10 brigades, each comprising 3 battalions of infantry, 1 regiment of cavalry, 2 mountain batteries, 2 field batteries, and for this force it seems to us that a mission could furnish a headquarters instructional staff together with instructors for the various arms [corrupt group], and in specialist matters. As regards financial aspect of scheme, we are unable to criticise Cox’s proposals at short notice. We are very doubtful, however, whether this estimate of a million sterling down, with another million or two in sight, would prove at all near the mark unless his scheme is very greatly reduced. In any case w r e must repeat our warning that it will be our duty strenuously to resist any extension of India’s financial commitments in Persian affairs. Iso. 8. Sir P. Co% to Earl Curzon.—(Received May 1, 4'10 p.m.) (No. 324. Most Urgent.) FOLLOWING sent to India :— Tehran, April 30, 1919. (April 30, 4 20 p.m.) Reference to Foreign Department telegram No. 484 S. of 24th April. I am indeed sorry Government of India should view with such disfavour and misgiving negotiations now in progress, but I cannot help thinking that in defending position which they feel obliged to take up they are inclined in some directions to see phantoms. On reading through correspondence dating from my telegram No. 970 of 14th November to the present, it seems to me that divergency of view existing is now more apparent than real, and that between policy indicated in draft agreements submitted and views expressed in Government of India’s telegram of 28th January there is really little difference, while it must be remembered that state of public opinion has in the meantime become much more favourable to close associations with us. As regards advisers, Government of India would like security of financial control and stop then, while as regards uniform force, they deprecate rigid insistence on British officers, but do not object to a British instructional mission. In the first connection it will involve little less difficulty and risk to obtain execution of financial control alone than it will to obtain the rest ot desiderata, which latter are regarded as natural corollary of former. Draft agreement provides for recourse to us for all advisers that may be needed, but it is not necessary to press a !? net]work of them on administration forthwith, nor need we insist on our exclusive rights too rigidly. Thus there is no need to dismiss foreigners now here nor to object to engagement of a foreigner if we approve of him. On the other hand, my belief [(is | that work and position of a British financial commission would soon become impossible if they were surrounded by a “ salade russe ” of foreign advisers in other depaitments who for the most part would be occupied in [? working] against them [gioup umie- cypherable] similar in the^case of uniform force ; I think we must accept apparently loyal Swedes and a few Russians now here. If they prove disloyal to us or unfit they can gradually be paid off ; but after our past experience, to allow an organised 1 ersian force to be officered by another nationality if we can possibly officer it ourselves wom.d I should emphasise here splendid reputations which our troops in 1 ersia have earned amongst people and [? their] officials. Not a word of complaint overreaches me, and press are continually expressing appreciation of their attitude Incidentally Tehran is included, with my concurrence, in Northern ersian force area for purposes of leave, and there is a small but continuous stream of officers am men visiting' Tehran before demobilisation. They are welcomed m town, and hitherto there has never been the slightest complaint against them, b urther, we nave aerodrome here, and planes come here whenever they please. _ ^ , , , I cannot legislate for hostile attitude of British newspapers or ^h^'ts ol spread of revolutionary agitation in India, Egypt, or successful advance of Bolshevism ; but at any rate those sinister possibilities emphasise necessity, if we mean business, of going through with it at once. At present dice are loaded m our favour, but tins wi j not he the case for very much longer. [1867] CAs regards people of Persia, what they are crying out for is security of life and property, improvement of trade routes, reform of central administration, and to know that they are really going to be helped. If we could only allow local newspapers and our consuls in Persia to make it known that reform and progress were no longer bo be blocked by foreign rivalries, and that we were specially going to assist Persia in arranging for Mohammerah, Tehran, or Bagdad-Tehran Railways, 1 am confident we should have the mass of public opinion with us. As it is elections are going very well for the present Cabinet so far. 1 must add following brief comment on details of Government of India's telegram above quoted :— 1. I think it is hardly justifiable at' this stage to refer to draft agreements and proposals as “ Cox’s latest scheme,” in view of first and second paragraphs in your telegram No. 38 of 23rd January, repeated to India. Either it is policy of His Majesty’s Government or it is not. 2. Demands of Shah and triumvirate are more Persico [sic], and will not amount to very much in their ultimate form. 3. I he only coercion I contemplated was possible demonstration by JCasvin garrison in the event of Starosselski, or a few selected self-seeking democrats in capital, endeavouring to engineer trouble. We are in no wise committed necessarify to maintain this Cabinet by force. It is undoubtedly best we could get, but in absence of any Bolshevik movement I should not fear a change, though 1 should regret it. 4. financial commitments are a .question of imperial interests, and I cannot comment. o. Military aspect ol arrangement is, in my opinion, precisely contrary to that suggested by Government of India. If we do not grasp the opportunity country will relapse into violent anarchy, necessitating intervention on a large scale. If we do grasp it we can withdraw troops as soon as uniform force takes shape. ^ Ver ^ Ipr news', I cannot estimate probabilities of spread of anti-bntish propaganda from Egyptian and’ Bolshevik directions. Up to now there has been no apparent result. 7. Question of police.

If neither France nor America would accept it now L* ta .Y naturally put. out of the question], we may feel tolerably certain that they will not accept it at a later period, for unless I am greatly mistaken it will gradually daw r n upon civilised mankind that exercise of mandatory powers is not of necessity either lucrative or agreeable. I he moral of these reflections is that we should endeavour m our diplomacy with 1 eisia to { ? make] it clear that our policy is to give favours, not to ask them. That if the Shah or his people, or both, think that they can get on without our aid they are welcome io no so, but th.at, if they want to call in any other Power, we could only tolerate this il policies were carried out in regular fashion and Persia were prepared to place herself under the protection of some mandatory which should hold, like others, mandatories from league of Nations. Present system of spending our money and our energies to keep Persia on her legs, getting nothing in exchange except attacks from those Persians who lay special claims to patriotism, seems to me quite intolerable. It should be our aim to convince them that we desire to encourage every form of Persian independence, except that Oriental form which consists in maintaining a false appearance of stability by dexterously balancing opposing interests of Western Powers; and that only reward or desire is that on western frontier of Afghanistan and India we should have a neighbour friendly, orderly, prosperous, and peaceful. rr O_[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Mig esty s Government. 1 CONFIDENTIAL.. Part III. No. 1. Earl Curzon to Sir P. Cox. (No. 204;.) (Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, Mag 9, 1919. YUuK telegram No. 257 and connected telegrams, including your telegram No. 308. Eastern Committee have gone carefully through text of proposed agreement, which \\ e are most anxious to get into a shape that will facilitate early conclusion. Following observations are submitted — Clause 2. It would be better after the words “ Persian Government ” to say ‘the services of whatever expert advisers may after consultation between the two Governments be considered necessary, &amp;c.” Clause 3. For the five words after “ Persia ” substitute “ in respect of the.” Clause 4, by placing the security before the loan, appears to suggest that we are more interested in getting the former than in offering the latter. Could you not transpose and name loan first and security second ? In concluding sentence after ” advance ” should be inserted “on account of it.” Clause 6 may have a value which we do not fully appreciate. But it appears to be open to objection that it encourages a reference to Peace Conference, as only place where existing treaties with other Powers as well as ourselves can be revised at very moment when we are deprecating any such reference. d he same risk is apparent in paragraphs (a) and fb) of subsidiary agreement (your telegram No. 259), since Persian Government could reasonably contend that at Peace Conference alone can they obtain compensation or secure rectification of frontiers. W e would prefer to dispense with any such compromising assurances, unless you think them absolutely necessary, in which case they might be differently warded and included in separate letter. Your telegram No. 262. It is impossible to go beyond the assurance “ Shah and his successors will have our friendly support.” As to permanent subsidy to Shah or pecuniary solatium to friendly persons on contempiaied scale, neither would be likely to receive Parliamentary assent. Auditor-General would decline to pass an extra month's charge of monthly subsidy of 350,000 tomans. Our view is that proposed agreement will be of utmost advantage to Persia, who gains much while losing nothing. Idea of compensating Ministers appears therefore to be out of the question. We could hardly go beyond guarantee of asylum. If Ministers are so frightened of proposed agreement as to fear expulsion, agreement itself would not rest on very secure foundation. Similarly no British Government would employ coercion to obtain or enforce a compliance, which must either be freely given or not all. With regard to proposed loan, consent of Treasury, which has not yet been given, would be more easily obtained if we knew what precise security Persian Government would be prepared to offer. Hitherto southern customs have been our main security. Disappearance of Russia may now have released other sources in Northern Persia or elsewhere, about which w^e wmuld welcome your opinion. No mention is made in draft whether loan would be in sterling or in local currency. Former alternative would be greatly preferable, because of less difficulty in remission of funds. We are hopeful that you may be able to give us a revised draft on above lines with which we can go to Treasury. (Repeated to India.)No. 2. Sir P. Cox to Earl Curzon— (Received Mat/ 14.)

They enquire, however, for their personal enlightenment as to what would be juncture at which in each case His Majesty’s Government would be ready to give enefct to their co-operation. &lt;t . May I suggest something on following lines ? As regards tieaties^ As soon as peace is concluded and Conference disperses.’ As regards frontiers, On receiving Persia’s detailed aspirations and arguments on which they are based they will decide what is possible in consultation with Persian Government, and discuss with Government principally concerned.'' As regards compensation, could matter be dealt with by League ol Nations when formed ? I am telegraphing separately text of proposed draft letter for approval or modification. Apart from letter Cabinet ask. if possible, for indication of some innocuous terms in which they could make known cautiously and informally our helpful attitude in these matters for propaganda purposes. As regards Shah, he will be much disappointed at tenor of your response regarding himself, but should he in consequence adopt obstructive attitude it is considered that it will be possible to sterilise his amenities. As regards triumvirate, they fear His Majesty’s Government have not quite appreciated their position. Semblance of “ coercion ” has been explained in my telegram No. 324. They represent that they are not apprehensive that policy will not succeed. If they were they would not embark on it. But they cannot expect to be in office all their lives, and some future Cabinet, although it had our approval and was working our policy, might have reasons for persecuting any one of them if they had not our friendly protection. They urge that they are only asking the protection which has been given in several cases before by Russian Government or ours to individuals who have deserved well or have been honoured by us. In any case, however, they do not wish that conclusion of these negotiations should be delayed by discussion of their personal interests, and arfc content to leave matter in our hands for settlement afterwards. As regards secret service money, it is assumed you will let them have amount as advance on account of loan. As regards loan, in way of security it is considered that customs revenue will be most satisfactory source for it, and it is proposed dur lien on customs of south should be extended to include customs of Seistan, Kermanshah, and, if necessary, those of Azerbaijan.^ 1 have not mentioned Azerbaijan especially, but suggest some of customs oi north &gt;f necessary can be raised later.

It is assumed that His Majesty's Government will not wish to complicate present negotiations by introducing any new proposals, but in case His Majesty s Govern ment should, on conclusion of these negotiations, wish to revise security earmarked for previous debts, 1 submit following note prepared by Mr. MacleaH' “ Existing debts secured on southern customs are “ Pre-war loans, 2,054,000L “ Half moratorium advances, 405,COOL • “ Rran advances in Bushire, Shiraz, and Tehran to end of May 1919, TSSjOOOjOOO krans, equal at 26 to 1,451,0001. “ Adding proposed loan, 2,000,000Z., total becomes 5,920,0001, which, if consoli dated on most favourable terms, would require an annual payment of at least 326,0007.. equal at present exchange of 26 to 847,000 tomans, or, at pre-war exchange of 54, to 1,700,000 tomans. Present customs revenues of southern customs provide ample security, but if trade and exchange should revert to pre-war conditions it would require all net customs revenue of South Persia, from Seistan to Khoi, to meet annual debt, payment, but inclusion of remaining surplus customs revenue of Julfa and Tabriz would provide a margin of 700,000 tomans.” (Sent to India.)

Foreign Office, May 17, 1919, 6 r.M. Y OUR recent telegrams, official and private. 1 entirely concur as to importance of early settlement and dangers of delay, and if 1 ask further questions it is only to avoid embarrassing consequences of accepting terms which may at a later date be differently interpreted by the two parties. lor instance, as regards text of proposed letter in your telegrams unnumbered of Idth May, it looks to me as though Triumvirate were putting into this letter the conditions for which Mushaver is unsuccessfully contending at Paris in order to circumvent latter and represent to Persian critics that they have obtained from us spontaneously what their colleague could not secure from Peace Conference. If this be so, terms of this document must be examined in light of Mushaver’s published demands. 1. When mention is made of existing treaties, does it mean Anglo-Persian treaties based on Turkmanchai Treaty which Persia has now denounced ? Or does it mean treaties between Persia and other Powers ? And in either case, what shall we be expected to do ? 2. What are present-day requirements ? Allusion is obscure, and seems to point to abolition of Capitulations, consular guards, and other privileges which it would be impossible to abandon. 3. from what tribunal other than Peace Conference is it expected that we should endeavour to obtain compensation for damage suffered by Persia ? Does this promise therefore mean anything ? 4. Tour telegram No. 356. I note that two sentences, as regards treaties and frontiers suggested by you in paragraph 2, do not appear in text of proposed letter. Are they to be regarded as dropped ? 5. It is almost certain that question of compensation would not fall within purview of League of Nations when formed. 6. In same telegram Persian Government appear to revert to original suggestion of advance of 500,000 tomans on account of loan. I gravely doubt wisdom of such action. Should present Cabinet fall and be succeeded by Mushaver or others, fact that first 200,000L of loan had been expended for such purpose wmuld become known in Persia, wmuld effectively damn career of Triumvirate, and if made public would excite severest criticism here. We could conclude agreement at once, subject to consent of Treasury, for which I am prepared to press, if we could get rid of perplexities to wffiich 1 have referred. No. 2. Sir P. Cox to Earl Curzon.—{Received May 22, 11'5 a.w.) (Most Urgent^) ' Tehran, May 21, 1919. (Private and Personal.) (YJay 21, 11 a.m.) YOUR private telegram 17th May. Second paragraph.—Though result is perhaps the same, I would rather state position as follows :— In November last, at our request, Persian Government formulated the design which they hoped to lay before Peace Conference (see my telegram No. 1003 of last year). If in pursuit of a strongly pro-British policy they deli berately fail even to get these designs discussed at Conference, much less complied with, it is essential that they should be able to justify themselves by showing that their policy had at all events achieved very material advantages for country [? from] other means. W ith reference to clauses 1 [1982]and 2 of your message. Apart from fact of denunciation of Treaty of Turkmancfiai (which is not recognised in so far as we are concerned), it may be assumed, 1 thin , that in view of friendly assurances they have received from hussian Legation and elsewhere, that when new Russian Government takes shape it will resume relations with Persia on a revised basis. Cabinet only ask us to scrutinise our own treaties with a view to revision. They are confident that it we agree to do so other Powers will follow suit, and [? of course] any modification affecting ext ra- territoriality or judicial status of foreigners*' will depend on concurrence of other Powers also. Mere consent to examine treaties does not commit us to accept any modification that does not commend itself to us, and Cabinet do not for a moment expect [? abandonment of] privileges to which you refer. To make [? above] clearer perhaps you would prefer to refer to examination of “treaties existing between the two Governments ’ instead of u by the two Governments, and to omit words in conformity with present-day requirements,'' substituting, if you think fit, words “ where considered necessary T and desirable by both parties.” Clauses 3 and 5 : If you hold that question of compensation (or rectification of frontier) must be dealt with by Peace Conference or not at ail, the only course would seem to be that, provided that Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs’ mission is first abandoned, His Majesty’s Government should agree to bring the matter before Conference on behalf of Persia (see my telegram No. 261). I must discuss this again with Triumvirate, and will reply after doing so. Clause 4 : The two sentences quoted in my telegram No. 356 were not intended for insertion in letter, but as draft replies to separate request of Triumvirate for personal enlightenment. Are they accepted specially ? Clause 6 : If amount represents difficulty it might be reduced, but a substantial sum for secret service is essential. It is true that Cabinet cannot hold office indefinitely ; on the other hand, it is recognised by both them and me that they must remain until new policy is firmly established ; I should hope for a couple of years with our staunch support. Contingency which you apprehend consequently seems hardly to need to be taken into account. Perhaps a more euphonious definition of item could be found, such as “ education of public opinion ” or “ costly initiation of reforms ? ”CONFIDENTIAL. Part V. No. 1. Sir V. Cox, to Earl Curzon. — (Received May 25, 3’15 p.m.) ( [Unnumbered.] Very Urgent.) (Private and Personal.) Tehran, May 24, 1110 a.m. Mi private telegram of 21st May. I have discussed compensation question further with Triumvirate. They are of opinion that representations of Persia’s interest by His Majesty’s Government at this stage would not be regarded favourably by public, and that if any question is to be ventilated at 1 eace Conference, it would be advisable for them to j ? appoint another] representative for the purpose in consultation with us. As regards text of separate letter, I am confident that, if one of Triumvirate or I could be present for a few hours for personal discussion with His Majesty’s Govern ment, an innocuous and suitable draft could be evolved ; but it is difficult to reach that result by exchange of telegrams without loss of time, which is prejudicial to our interests. I have therefore proposed abbreviated draft, and Triumvirate are prepared to accept following if His Majesty’s Government feel able to approve. Preamble would be the same as that submitted in my telegram No. 359, but ending with words in connection with following three desiderata ” instead of as previously worded. Then as follows :— (R.) ‘ ‘ Clause 1. Revision of the treaties at present in operation between two Powers. Clause 2. Claim of Persia to compensation of material damage suffered at hands of the other belligerents. Clause 3. Rectifications of frontier of Persia at points where it is agreed upon by the parties to be justifiable. “ Clause 4. Precise manner, time, and means to be chosen for pursuing these aims and for representation of [group undecypher able] of second and third before Peace Conference by Persian representative hereinafter mentioned, sh&amp;W be discussed forthwith between His Majesty’s Foreign Office and the special representative now-to be appointed by Persian Government for the purpose of acceptance of His Majesty’s Government. The latter are not prepared to afford co-operation in regard to above questions so long as Mushaver-el-Mamalek continues to represent Persian interests.” (End of R.) Words in clause 4, between “ aims ” and “ shall be discussed ” are inserted at desire of Triumvirate ; they argue that whether either matter is to be ventilated before Conference or not depends entirely on results of discussion of details between His Majesty’s Government and their special envoy. If above draft does not entirely meet with your approval, perhaps draft could be telegraphed to me which does suit His Majesty’s Government. With a letter on above lines and some concessions from His Majesty’s Government in regard to “secret service.” [P item] I think negotiations can be concluded without further delay. No. 2.

I have informed him that I am prepared to accept this liability, subject to my Council’s approval, on understanding that [2109]Treasury agree to re-examine whole question of incidence of Persian expenditure, and that if examination leads to readjustment in principle of scale of division as between British and Indian revenues, new scale will apply retrospectively to loan now’ in contemplation. It is proposed that new loan should be secured on southern customs plus those of Seistan, Kermanshah, and Azerbaijan, or other available revenues of Persian Government. Loan must be made available in gold, silver, or local currency, last named being obviously greatly preferable so far as practicable. In respect to Indian moiety Imperial Bank could doubtless obtain krans by sale of rupee drafts on you (vide my telegram of 21st May and your reply of 25th May). If krans for British moiety cannot be obtained in full by sale of sterling, could you supply any further rupees against repayment to me by Treasury in sterling?

(Sent to India.) No. 5. Earl Curzon to Sir P. Cox (Tehran). (No 330. Very Grgent.) Foreign Office, June 10, 1919, 9 p.m. TOUR telegram No. 399 of 5th June: Negotiations with Persian Government: Loan. Paragraph 1 : 1 agree. Government of India will be asked to afford to the bank such facilities as may be possible. Paragraph 1' : There is no question of the loan being made by anyone but His Majesty’s Government, and in these circumstances the question of a public issue will not arise. Paragraph 3 : 1 agree. As regards specific conditions of loan in question point 1 is acceptable. Point 2 : British financial advances to Persia used to be at 5 per cent., and were raised to 7 per cent, in case of joint Anglo-Russian advances owing to alleged difficulty of Russian Ministry of Finance in finding the money at less than 7 per cent. Now, however, in view of dearness of money treasury would in ordinary cncumstances ask 8 per cent, interest; you should be guided accordingly, though I might try to secure a lower rate if thereby w r e might obtain some useful concession in the general negotiations. .co r Point 3 : I note that in concluding paragraph of your telegram No. 358 of 14th May opinion is expressed that present customs revenues of southein customs provide ample security. In view of possibility of Russia consolidating herseo some day and again taking interest in Persian affairs, it may not be desirable to mention specifically the plac s enumerated in paragraph 3 ot loan conditions. 1 v 'onld piefVi therefore to add after the words ‘‘net customs receipts toe words ot all the remaining customs revenues £0 long as they are available. _ Points 4 and 5 : Unobjectionable. Owing to absence of Chancellor of Exchequer I have not been able to take his definite views on the subject, but see no objection to vour proposing above-mentioned conditions to Persian Government. While general conditions must necessarily be dependent on this financial proposition, it may hasten matters if I offer the following comments on your telegram of 24th May, Private and Personal, regaidmg the separate iliaft lettei to Persian Prime Minister. . . , . , The alternative wording for separate letter given in your above-mentioned telegram is open to various objections which do not apply to previous text contained in vour telegram No. 359 of 13th May. • , i i • ' Firstlyf all renunciation of claims by one Government against the other is omitted.4 Secondly, His Majesty’s Government are definitely committed to discussion fortWh oi manner, time, and means to be chosen for putting Persia s compensation and frontier desiderata before tbe Peace Conference. , XT oro On the other hand, Persian Government were reported in yonr telegram No 356 to have no desire that these two questions should be raised before the Peace ^Further, the wording about Mushaver in last sentence, if allowed to stand, would place upon His Majesty’s Government the primary responsibility of ousting his Excellency from Paris. . .. . ,. c , . This would, I think, be a serious error. For it would make a lifelong enemy of Mushaver and would antagonise his friends. Isor is it necessaiy, since have no objection to him per se, and am quite prepared to discuss matters with him when once agreement has been signed, provided his Government are assured of his loyaltv and bona fides. He is perpetually asking for meeting with me, and it may he that plan would be to take him into confidence. But of this Persian Government must he the judge. I am quite ready to leave to your discretion whether to raise above-mentioned points at the same time as that of the loan or to defer them for sepaiate conversation with Persian Prime Minister, but your frequent ami reasonable appeals for expedition suggest that action should not be delayed.

Our position was safeguarded by reference to “other belligerents,” but leciproca. renunciation of claims was not specifically mentioned, as I thought it mi^ht be necessary or convenient to show this short draft to Entente Governments at the sanu; time as mam agreement. There is no objection, as far as Persian Government is concerned, to specific mention. , j 1 / e . on t* 118 su b.l ec t I would explain basis on which I have all along discussed it. that i 1 ersia presented to us a claim for damage bv our troops wp should present bill tor maintenance of troops which we had been obliged to send to Persia owing to latter’s inability to defend her neutrality. It does not involve abandonment of personal claims of British subjects or that of oil company for breach of pipe-line. Kindly confirm this. 2. i ime and means of ventilating desiderata depends on agreement between parties, or practically on pleasure of His Majesty’s Government. If “forthwith” is objected to, “as soon as practicable ” would perhaps meet requirements. Alternative word might be omitted. o, W hen 1 stated in my telegram No. 356 that Persian Government had no desire to ventilate desiderata before Peace Conference, it was on the hypothesis that there were other means of doing so, but your telegram of the 17th May, to which I replied on the 21st May, suggested that there was no alternative, and it was supposed that Conference would soon be over. 4. As regards Mushaver. Having seen most of his telegrams I am convinced (and so is Triumvirate) that we cannot rely on his loyalty or bona fides for any purpose connected with present negotiations. Moreover, once they are concluded/l do not quite see what could usefully be discussed with him. Cabinet would prefer to eliminate him by appointing him to some diplomatic post. In any case there is no necessity for us to take onus of ousting him if you do not wish it, and that sentence might be omitted. After considering above explanations, kindly let me know which draft you finally decide on, and with wdiat modifications. In conclusion, I would mention that the Shah is beginning to talk again of his journey to Europe in the autumn, and I hope that you will give me authority when I visit him again in regard to pending agreement, to say he will be given all co-operation, and (if possible) invitation to England.

Tehran, June 24, 1919, YOUR telegram No. 330. - Point 2 : Triumvirate plead hard for 7 per cent., which is rate of former advances and is supported by present price of 1911 loan. They also press for period of twenty years for payment instead of fifteen, in order to reduce annual instalments payable,This does not seem to be a point of much practical significance, because in all pro bability this advance will be converted long before that through some scheme of consolidation of floating debt. Point 3 : Opinion expressed in concluding paragraph of my telegram No. 358 was specifically qualified. Southern Customs revenue before the war afforded bare security for then existing debt of 2,000,000£. They furnish at present sufficient receipts for service of a debt of 6,000,000£., because the pound sterling costs 20 instead of 54 krang and because whole of trade of Persia has been passing through these Southern customs offices, as every other route has been closed. Kermanshah, however, is already drawing away part of this fortuitous trade and Customs revenue. This does not suggest, therefore, that amendment proposed by you [group undecypherable] sufficiently explicit. I have collaborated with Triumvirate following formula for this article as follows :— “ All receipts pledged to Ifill loan are pledged to present advance with continuity of all conditions stipulated in 1911 loan contract, and with priority over all debts other than 1911 loan and subsequent advances. In case of deficit, Persian Government will make good necessary sums from other resources, and for that purpose hereby pledges to service of present and other advances above-mentioned in priority, and with continuity of conditions stipulated in above-mentioned contract, the Customs receipts [in whole or in part] of all other regions in so far as receipts are or shall be at its diposal.” This formula enables us to dispense with point 4, to which objection has been made.

Sir, India Office, July 2, 1919. I AM directed by the Secretary of State for India in Council to acquaint you, for the information of Earl Curzon of Kedleston, that he has laid before the Council of India the question of the contribution from Indian revenues of a moiety of the projected loan of 2,000,000/. to the Persian Government. The Secretary of State in Council, after consultation with the Government of India bv telegraphic correspondence (copy of which is enclosed), is willing to accept this liability on Indian revenues on the understanding that the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury agree to the re-examination at the earliest convenient d:ite of the whole question of the incidence on Indian and Imperial revenues of expenditure in Persia, and further, that if this examination leads to a readjustment in principle of the scale of division of such expenditure the new scale shall be applied with retrospective effect to the loan now in contemplation, including, of course, any advance payments to the Persian Government, which are to be charged to that Government against the loan. Mr. Montagu would draw Lord Curzon’s special attention to the last sentence of paragraph 1 of the Government of India’s telegram of the 13th June, and directs me to say that his concurrence in the present scheme has been given in the belief that the policv now being inaugurated will result in a great reduction of the liabilities of His Majesty’s Government in Persia. While, therefore, he does not share the misgivings of the Government of India he is as unwilling as they are to contemplate any further charge on Indian revenues on this account. As regards the second paragraph of the Government of India’s telegram the Secretary of State concurs in their remarks in regard to the means of making the loan available, and regrets that he cannot undertake to afford facilities to the Treasury by the supply of rupees in India against repayment in sterling in respect of any portion of the British moiety of the loan. He would, for the reason advanced by the Government of India* be glad if the operation of making the loan available were deferred as long as possible. I am, &amp;c. A. HIRTZEL. May 30, 1919. Enclosure 1 in No. 2. Mr. Montagu to Government of India. (Telegraphic.) P. PERSIAN negotiations. Please refer to my telegram dated 9th instant. _ Provided contribution of half cost is made bv India, Treasury agree to finance loan to Persian Government of S.OOO.OOOZ. Reply I have made to Treasury is that, subject [437J ISto approval of Council of India, I am prepared to undertake this liability on the condition that they agree to re-examination of the whole question of the incidence of expenditure on Persia, and that in the event of such re-examination involving a readjustment in principle of the scale on which division of cost between Imperial and Indian revenues is based, the loan now contemplated shall come under the retrospective application of the new scale. Security proposed for new loan, in addition to revenues of southern customs, is customs of Azerbaijan, Seistan, and Kermanshah, or other Persian Government revenues which may he available. It is necessary that the loan should be made available in gold, or silver, or local currency ; obviously availability in local currency so far as practicable is greatly to be. preferred. So far as India’s share is concerned, no doubt Imperial Bank could obtain krans by selling rupee drafts on you * see in this connection my telegram dated 21st May and yours of 25th Mav in reply' If it is not possible, by selling sterling, to obtain krans for British moiety in full, could you supply any rupees in addition against refund in sterling by Treasury to me ? This message is being sent also to Minister at Tehran, whose advice is being sought in regard to dates of payment and amounts of instalments and rate of interest. Above proposal, in my opinion, affords the most hopeful prospect available of reaching a solution of Persian questions such as to provide a Government friendly in attitude and stable in character, and at the same time to terminate the demand on Indian funds for large subsidies at irregular intervals for particular purposes. Enclosure 2 in No. 2. Government of India to Mr. Montagu. (Telegraphic) P _ LI is noted that in your telegram of 30th May, regarding loan to Persia, you have agreed to accept liability of half share on condition of willingness of Treasury to re examine whole question of incidence of Persian expenditure, and that application of any consequential readjustment will extend with retrospective effect to loan now in question. The present scheme causes us misgiving, and we therefore trust that there will L)e no extension of the liability you have now accepted. As regards the method of making loan available, it is recognised that the must convenient method m regard to the Indian half is that suggested, viz,, that by selling- rupee drafts on us Imperial Bank of Persia should obtain krans. But as it seems probable just now that there will again shortly be great difficulties in our Treasury position here, the postponement of this operation for as long as practicable would be a convenience.

YOUR telegram No. 389. n i .^ ue J* v ] ' n P ar agraph 1 of my telegram No. 464 was prompted by request from Cabinet tor drafts in French, and their assumption that official text would be in that language. If drafts are in English they will also have to be in Persian. I will discuss point again with Prime Minister, and if French text is to be employed at all, I think it would be best to telegraph it. Meanwhile there are one or two remaining new points which can be dealt with independently. Although English texts were provisionally accepted by Cabinet, they have, on seeing ^ r rench version, asked for one or two material alterations. For facilitv of cyphering I refer to English text. 1. In article 1 oi principal agreement they ask for insertion of word ** absolutely ” or “ completely ” after words “ to respect,” 2. In article 2 they ask for omission of words‘‘after consultation between tw'o Governments. 1 heir reason is that subject of “ tutelage ” has been good deal in evidence of late, and they are anxious to eliminate anything that could be quoted as tending in that direction. 3. I considered necessity of altering wording of article 4, but came to conclusion that it was [? better] to let it stand, and to append separate loan contract referring to principal agreement on lines already accepted. Text will be telegraphed to you, with others, for approval. 4. Since being informed of views expressed in paragraph 6 of your telegram 17th May, triumvirate had not again discussed question of advance for propaganda and secret service. They have returned to attack however, in the course of these final [? discussions]. They urge that expenditure of such a sum as 2,000L [? 20,000£.j would do more harm than good, as it would simply stimulate [? the] appetites of numerous people who could not be satisfied ; that [omitted : ? there] are only tw'o alternatives, either to pay nothing at all and fight agreement on its merits, or topay liberally, and establish it without fighting. In former case, brunt ol risk and fighting will fall on them ; for in first place they all liave politic&lt;d enemies, and in second place there is a section of public which does not want reforms by anybody, or in any direction, and if both of these elements are disappointed from negotiations [? they will] do their best to [make] difficulties. They urge that, loan once having been accepted by Parliament, neeessiryof laying before Parliament question of this small [? advance] from it can hardly arise. As regards points 1 and 2 above, triumvirate can hardly insist, but unless you consider there are essential objections 1 should be inclined to humour them in both cases. As regards point 4, scale of payments both by us and by others during war has necessarily enlarged people’s ideas in this direction. There is no doubt triumvirate will have to pay freely to make things go smoothly, and as money will be Persian Government’s and not ours, I recommend advance be given for inauguration of preliminary reform scheme.

Almost all of the correspondence is conducted between Sir Percy Zachariah Cox [Acting British Minister to Persia] and Earl Curzon [George Nathaniel Curzon, Acting Foreign Secretary in the absence of Arthur James Balfour, who was attending the Paris Peace Conference]. Other correspondents include the Viceroy of India [Frederic John Napier Thesiger], the Foreign Secretary [Balfour], the India Office, and the Secretary of State for India [Edwin Samuel Montagu].The telegrams document negotiations – running concurrently with the Paris Peace Conference – between Cox and the Persian Government for an Anglo-Persian Treaty. Cox's telegrams notify Curzon of the details of a draft agreement; Curzon's telegrams to Cox make requests for revisions to the wording and, in certain cases, to the essence of the draft.Topics of discussion include: the Persian Government's desire for the frontiers of Persia to be rectified in certain localities and Britain's policy on this issue; Persian claims to compensation for damage suffered during the war at the hands of the other belligerents; the likelihood of the Persian case being heard at the Paris Conference; details of a proposed new loan to the Persian Government from the British Government, and the Secretary of State for India's concerns about the implications of this loan for the division of expenditure on Persia between Imperial and Indian revenues.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for India, United Kingdom</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Persia, Qajar dynasty</namePart></name></subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Sir Knight Percy Zachariah Cox</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston George Nathaniel Curzon</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Loans</topic></subject><subject><topic>Foreign affairs</topic></subject><subject><topic>Paris Peace Conference (1919-1920)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Reparations</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000189#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
