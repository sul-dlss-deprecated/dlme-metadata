Much of this correspondence relates to the details of a financial 'war subsidy' paid to the Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Said bin Taimur [Sa‘īd bin Taymūr], and how exactly it should be spent. Correspondence towards the rear of the volume discusses the compilation and distribution of 'Bombing Target Catalogues' (lists of potential targets) by British Forces in India.The majority of the correspondence in the volume is between the Political Agency in Muscat, the Political Residency in Bushire and Said bin Taimur. Most of the correspondence with the Sultan is in Arabic accompanied by English translations.In addition to this correspondence, the volume also contains the following related documents:'Note on an interview with His Highness the Sultan at the "Palace" at 9-30 a.m. on the 30th November 1939' (folio 34)'Copy of an extract from a note on an interview between His Highness the Sultan of Muscat and Oman and the Treasury Officer Muscat on February the 3rd, 1940' (folio 99)'Details of Training and Equipment of the Muscat Infantry, for the year 1940' (folios 158-163).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Persian Gulf Political Residency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Second World War (1939-1945)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Military logistics</topic></subject><subject><topic>Defence</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x0000a1#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x0000a1#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
