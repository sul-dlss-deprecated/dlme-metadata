Yfazir to H • H • Say id Teimur 'tmm fiwiotNa. OlMflfiBIiAl RfcCQRDl Memorandum, The following few remarks are recorded in the hope that they may be of sonie us© and as a jaemorandun of guidance on soni inportant points. . (i) International position of the state of Muscat. Muscat is acknowledged by treaty as an independent state by Great Britain, the United States of America, France and Holland, and its independence is expressly guaranteed by the British and French governments in a Joint agreement. British and French consuls are at present resident in Muscat and till quite recently there was an American vice-consul. The greatest care should therefore be taken b/ you when acting in your official capacity as a servant of the state to observe most punctiliously the usual diplomatic courtesies to the representatives of foreign countries equally. The subjects of foreign countries are also by treaty, notably in the case of Great Britain and France, triable by the consular courts of the countries concerned. 2) Peculiar position of Great Britain with regard to Muscat. By many agreements and owing; to her preponderating influence in the Gulf Great Britain has obtained a dominant position in Muscat. Trade interests* engagements for the suppression of the slave trade, the necessity for controlling the arms traffic of which Muscat was formerly the centre for supplying the tribes of the Horth Wost Frontier, and finally the plain desirability of not having a hostile power in such an advantageous position opposite to India and at the entrance to the Gulf all contributed to tills ernd.(I 2lf- Our relations with Muscat on ,So to apoak &gt; the International baals are embodied In the Comnerclal treaty, wh3 ,Gh as re^rls prooeiare has been elaborate! In the Muscat Order in Council. Roughly British subjects receive most favoured nation treat- -ment, aild when they are accused of any criz?ie or ly ve any case brought- against t em by an Arab subject they are only triable in t c3 British consular court.The taxation which the Sultan may impose upon British subjects is strictly defined, and any new taxes or Imposts Imposed by th Sultan on his ovn subjects are not blnilr.. ur on British subjects unless th^/ .-ire so made by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf under what is known as a King's Regulation under the Muscat Order in Council Our relations with Muscat under agreement are very important. The Buitan may not alienate any portion of his dominions to a foreign power, he has consented to the reform of his administration especially in the matters of customs, justice m&amp;XK, levy corps and education, and he has to consult arid take the advice of the Political A|/ent in all matters of importance. The British aovermaent on its part has granted a loan to the state of 6^- lakhs of rupees to pay off t e Sultan's debts, and guarantees to maintain the effective authority of the Sultan on the coast. It also pays to the Sultan a subsidy of a lakh a year to compensate him for the arms traffic, and through it is also paid the Zanzibar subsidy. The Political A^ent must therefore b&lt;» consulted before any Important step is conten. lated. (3) Position of the state as regards Interior Ouan. It may be sal'I that f r almosj fifty years the Sultanr of Muscat have had no effective power over interior Oman. At present int rior Oman Is practically a separate state under a religious Imam. The British government has never assisted the Sultan in any way to attempt t^ r»aToiv^ 2 lost hoi I over the interior, nor is this its policy It confines J to helping the Sultan on the coast when nec ssary.Our present efforta are lirect^ 1 to trying to obtain a morluB Vivendi 'between the Imam and the Sultan* The Sultan himself has placed this matter entirely in the han5s of Gdvemmant anl himseir never corresponds with the interior* The greatest care should therefore be taken by you to avoid any action wiii oh mi Jit be interpreted as an attemx^t by the Bultan t© attack the Omanis with ta© object of bringing them under his rule. In such an attempt it in fairly certain that Crovomment would not assist him in any way # Nor should you oomnunicatt with the Omani cliiefs, as such communication will only be Interpreted by them as an attempt by the Sultan 1 s government to interfere with tiheir freedom# (4) Your personal position re^irls tue royal family« Your position here is very delicate and the vary greatest tact is necessary. Cultivate t crsoEai friendsh|) with t/ioa m far M p .salble and consult them even if JTM do not take their advice. Take no action with regard to any of them unless you are in a x^^^don to show openly that suoh action was by tiie direct order of the B It mi# Your osition now that the Sultan iB away is peculiarly hard. (5) Your general line of action and policy. The very skeleton of refinzm of the administration I b necessary. V 'e only want make'the state pay its way and our loan and if possible to make it stand on its own le&amp;s without continual propping from us. Make the customs pay and j^ulhs remove the more ^larin^ reform® and let the rest rip. Go very slow, be very tactful and try and remove any feeling that the people may ^et that your coming is only the prelude to British occupation* In addition to the fact that thi« in not true axh such a rumour cannot but have a bad effect on our policy and our prestige elsewhere. Pay tue greatest reflpect to lacal prejudices and above all to religion. It in not a difficult matter nowadays to arouse anti Christ! i&amp; sentiment, and the Omani fanatics are next door with whom we want to some kind of agreem nt. Officially wear some native uniform or dress, never British uniform of any kind which is never worn■■ by by a British officer in the servlc© of another state. Sink your Individuality as a British officer and take on that of an oriental wazir in a medieval Arab state. Entertain the ashraf.Concentrate on making your reforms such as are popular with the ?ople. Muscat under the last few Sultans has been famous even in Arabia for bad government and needless appresslon. ( K . Political A^ent # Muscat.

Muscat. i6th April 1930. From R.E.L.Win^ate Esq. I.C.S# Political Agent and H.B.M's Consul, Muscat To The Deputy Political Resident , Bushire. Sir I have the honour to forward a translation of a recent proclamation of H.H.the Sultan's Government relative to the reform of his Judicial system# It will 'be remembered that a reform of the administration of justice was one of the conditions of the loan. Up till quite recently jastice to all intents and purposes did not exist, and those to suffer most by this condition of affairs were the British subjects in whose hands the v&gt; reat majority of the trade is, and who were unable to obtain satisfactory redress against their Arab debtors. H,H# some time ago instituted a court under the presidency of Sayid Nadir, his brother. Complaints were however numerous against this man and Justice was slower and certainly more corrupt than it had been when H.H» saw to the cases himself. I had b en compelled on several occasions to protest to H.H. om this point. Sayid rladir finally resi^ne:!. Recently the wazir had been deciding cases and had instituted a commercial court. The situation was however still unsatisfactory and excessive fees were being imposed, a fatal mistake in a backward state like Muscat w^ere the essentials of any Judicial system are that it should be speedy, popular and cheap and that it should not interfere in any way with the religious suscentibilities f of the people. Acting therefore under my advice the waxir made subventions to the Qa^i and other notables wnichZ 2L 5P y resultei in their evolving tUe resulting system •! Jaear that the praclamation has given the artatest satisfaction to all classes. It will be seen that the main points in th^ system are (1) It ^ives to all persons the ri^ht to appear in person before the Qazi on any subject, and the Qazi may decile the case. The sole exceptionsto txiis rule are commercial cases over the value of Rs.500/-. The old method of personal justice by the religious Jud^e which is peculiarly suitel to Muscat anl which certainly accords *t with the wishes of the people is preserved. The onus of transferin-; a case to the other or civil court rests with the Qazi• (2) A regular 'adiliyah' court is provided and a fairly competent man has been appointed s Jud^e, This court tries all transfersd cases and all cases brought forward by iUMcBritish against Arab subjects which have to be presented through the Political A^ent and at the hearing of which t e Agency dragoman has t be present. Similarly cases by Arab against British subjects which have to be tried in the Consular court are presented through this court. Gases may of course be broujat before this Court direct. (3) A coramerc al court consisting of a bench of merchants has been provided to deal with complicated comiBrcial cases. This has already been working some time and in spite of the arguments which be advanced against the constitution of such a court ,it has ^iven great satiafac- -tion and has certainly achieved results. (4) Provision has been made against the interference by the Qazi's court with t e other court and X vice-versa. (5) Justice Is free, the only fees being charged being those for paper. I have the honout to be # Sir your most obelient servant -H 0 T I C 3§ # **-;****■****■«■ It is notified for the information of the inhabitants of the territories of the Cultan of aftoat and Omaxi that in view of the necessity of making as acceptable a system as possible that ws hare framed the admir.iRtretion of Justice and » . ' I have instituted courts of equity and Justice for the convenience of the public in the country and for the settlement of business. Two courts have been opened ShariaSi (religious) and Adliah (justice) # C-aees are divided into three cat^t ories jharialb (reli gious) tiliZHTiyRtx (civil) ana Tujarriyah (mercantile). Fvery one is at liberty to submit his clain in any of / the courts, he wishes, The only exceptions are mercantile cases or like.these if they aye for more than five hundred rupees which should be decided by the ^.jlis 'fujjar (Bench of merchants) | and must be file^in the ohakmah Adliah for submission before the ajlis ( bench), * Mo case can be submitted in both courts and no c/icc can be transferred at the parties option. All religious cases must be instituted in the Bhariah Court. If a case iM submitted in the Bhariah Court be found to need civil enquiries and cannot be decided in the Shariah Court it should be transferred to the court of dliah. Any one who wishes to appeal against nny decision, has a right to do so, by submitting his appeal before H.H. the Sultan with details of the case within two weeks of the date of decision# Whatever we notified on 1st April for pr- ent of Hs 5/- for every case and Rs.l/- for every witness is at present cancelled, but the stamped paper costing 25 pice is still re- maining and all clains to court of justice must be made on that I paper but it is nof required for the Jhariah Court, sd: for H«H« the oultan, by ^aslr.I Jo I SSCRST British Consulate and Political Agency 55/ r ?

Sir I have the h®n«ur invitg y#ur attention the eituation arising freai tVie expressed lenir^ of the Saltan of Muscat 5ayll kixxSsjc Teiaur Mn Faisal bin Turki to abdicate froia the Sultanate# It will be reraeaiberei that he ©xpreesel this wish verbally in India. The G-«vernment of India however decided that he jaust return to Muscat at the end of three months• The Sultan is therefore due back in Muscat some time at the end of June# At the time that this decision ^as arrl/ad at I had however ventured to su&amp;geat that oven though the Sultan should return, nevertheless the whole situation with rogart to the future of Muscat and his expressed deira to abdicate should be very carefully considered. The matter Is a very important one and clearly cannot be ended at the present position. The Sultan will either reiterate ills wish^ possibly openly, or he will prove obstructive when he returns. It is in these circumstances that I venture with some diffidonc to put forward the following views and su^estions. (I) the character of the Sultan. Sayld Teimar is nob unlntolU&amp;eit. Ho Is however incredibly weak and incurably vain,. Both these characteristics have not made him a BUCCGSsful ruler of an Arab stat.o. HI a weakness has result el in hie h«ln S exploited by Ms family and unscrupulouB persons ana in hits being unable to make any headway against the rebellion, while his vanityIn an Arab country iih^re and s®od manner p. towards hizh and low alike are •Vl.icatorj.hae alienated nany nf those who s.re 'by cenviotlon his supporters. In the interior owlnc to the aicrule of hl£ father and grand father which he has net Inprovod hlacclf, he Is hated, and this hatred has 'been t Intensified 'by his c«vall«r treatmert ^f r»helkhs and his general pomposity refered to above. He Is not really wantonly extravagant but si reply eijly al&amp;eut inoney* He Inherited Ills father*r absurd Idta# about his position and his Independence Jarggly the result of the An^lo-Frcnch position In Muscat. Tired of the ivhole affair and especially, of Muscat he has however now definitely abandoned th^se lieaa and has thrown himself unreservedly on our merey. As far as character is concerned he never will be a ^ucce^sful ruler. (i) ?he Sultan's fsimily # The Sultan has one son Sa/id Sail, about ten years old. He has many brothers, the Npet notable of whom are Say Id Nadir, half a negro, and Bay id Ha'uad, a freemason and with a tendency to become europetnlsei. Tlje rest and his many uncles and CDUsins and nephews are quits impossible and may be ruled out. For Sayid Said provided he is decently educated in India not in England, there are possibilities• Sayid Nadir V I p an inti&amp;uer and is rightly despised and detested. Sayid Ha^l is showing sl^na of becoming a useful member of society. He Is by character however unsulte to the first place in the state. From the royal family therefore there is nobody to auoe««« SayId Tsdaur except hie eon, and at present he le too youni to be anything aore than a figure head, of the admlnl b tratl on , (3) Our policy in Muscat. ffe are definitely oooaltteA to the support of the Sultan and the reform .f his administration en the oeast. Thsi reform is proceeding slowly and with a consideraHmearara of popular support. The stronger wo make the Sultan and hie the simpler will be the solution of the Oman problem, which is no more thmn the problem of * borderline of will trihetf who never have been controlled, and whom it would be felly to attempt to rulo. To continue our reform successfully we want %x1rx&amp;* a pliable ruler# It is open to ioubt if the present Sultan kept on the throne and in Muscat against his Till, will prove pliaole* There is therefore a strong prims, facie case for permitting the Sultan to abdicate. Such a step could not be taicen however without careful consideration iof the following points. (4) the form of government which would replace the rule of the Sultan during the minority of his lion. U) The effect of the abdication of the Sultan and of the form of rule which replace? him on J'uscat oplnion^and problems« (3} The light in which any action by us would be regarded by ousicte opinion* (4) Tue financial ability: of the etate to pension the Sultan atiiMicmijcx adequately. As regards (i) I would propose the formal recognition of Sayld Said as Sultan acting throu^ a Council oi Heisoncy. Such a council would be composed of three or five members with the British advisor always as a member* There would not be any difficulty in finding suitable men to act in this capacity. The veto which the political A^ent can always exercise m all setters of importance on which he must be consulted is sufficient sale guard agaJnst undesirable action by the Council# As regards the effect of such a step in Muscat I and Oman, I conjecture that it would probably be hailed with pi delight. Sayid Teimur is not popular and the interior distrusts him. The formation of a council of influential mento rule In his stead, backed up 'by our supp #rt would b« more A?o#pt®vle to all parties* and would certainly facilitate administration. but I would venture to suggest that we ma/ allay a great deal of ivs^icion by an pen declaration of policy as regards Muscat# could the Sultan a pension of firoa He.5000/• to z Xsi 9 iOOOO/** per mensem# aliould be sufficient for him and he would rirobabl:/ be content with this provided he had a little capital In addition which could be provided by the sale of Owadar and the anting of a portloli of the proceeds lio hia persoanally. Chiefs 1 College in India would be the best trainxns. All these suggeationi are tentative and I mtb^.t them with the greatest.diffidence. From what I know of the situation here and of the character of the Buitan I am however sure that soae action will have to be taken by us on this qiestlon- In vi^w or the Sult&amp;nia return at the end ®f June it would be advisaolt? to be prepared for eventualities, 'hat the Sultan ohould relvoi'n for a short tians certainly best, bat :.he shorter '•hr.t tine the better# If it should .be found possible oo arrive at a dd*initw policy and t# communicate it to the SulEtan before lus return and to set hiia to fisrev to it, vhich mil be iifiicult unless it proml se^- h?.m the prospect of early retirement, our positicn in Muscat will b® much simplified. As regards (3) I am not competent to speak. As regards (4) I am satisfied that the stato Trier remains the question of the education of Saylti Said, He should not remain in Muscat, aid possibly a X have t,h« honout to be Sir your mc-st obelient servant /) A Political Agent, Muscat.

To The Deputy political Resident, BushireW Sir I have the honour to refer to the question of the future education and training of Sayid Said bin Telmur, the son of H.H.Sayld Telmur bin Faisal, Sultan of Muscat and the heir to the Sultanate. In my secret letter No.898 dated the 28th April 1020 I had touched upon this question, and had advocated that Sayid Said should he sent to a Chiefs' College in India In the r ; event of my recommendations contained in the above letter being accepted. It is I think however incontrovertible that even in the event of the policy which I have outlined not being adopted by Government, the education of his son in a manner befitting hie future station and responsibilities is a subject of urgent and paramount importance. The Sultans of Muscat in the past and the present Sultan have been completely uneducated. This in Arabia is not an unusual state of affaire, but it is possible that it has seldom reached the absurd position which it has in Muscat, It is a melancholy fact that it was only a few years ago that the present Sultan learned to read and write. His brothers are in little better state and some are quite illiterate. Broughtjas they are among the women in the hideous position and climate of Muscat, it is little to windered at that at a very early age they develop into the most useless and vicious types of degenerates, possessed of childish ideas of their own importance, difficult to deal with, a justifiable cause of annoyance to the tribes of the .^54 Interior, and a continuous drain on the slender purse of the state# In the cases of the Sultans themselves this almost complete lack of education has made them the tools of unscrupulous ministers and courtiers, has deprived them of all power over or respect from their people and has without doubt made them both suspicious and difficult to deal with. It is perhaps permissible hereto refer to what I is nowjadmitted policy with regard to Muscat, which is to make the state and the ruler sufficiently strong to do without continual propping and interference from us. Efforts to put the administration on a sounder footing are being made, but the whole structure will fall to the ground later if we cannot supply a head of the state who will be the head of the state and who will command respect from his qualities and will endeavour to fulfill his responsibilities through his training For reasons which I have pointed out else- -where the hope of the state lies in Sayid Said, the son of the Sultan. He is an intelligent and excellent mannered little boy of eight to ten years old, who can read and write Arabic and wh6 is as yet uncorrupted by his horrible surroundings* In the healthy atmosphere and surroundings of A Chiefs' College such as the Mayo College at AJmere he would have a very fine chance of developing into a useful member of society. The boy himself has for long been anxious to go to school and has spoken to me on the subject. I had Intended to broach the subject to the Sultan immediately on his return, but as this has been delayed I took the opportunity of asking %he wazir Captain Maccollum who would be passing through Karachi on leave to open the question with the Sultan. I have today received a wire from Captain Maccollum that the Sultan agrees to sending his son to a Chiefs 1 College and hopes that the Political Agent will help to make the necessary arrangements as soon as possible. I hope that the wishes of the Sultan will commend themselves to your approval. I am most anxious thatsteps should be taken at once if possible to enable Sayld Said to enter a college next term. If I may venture a personal opinion it is that nothing but good can come from such a step, prom the point of view of climate, nearness to Muscat and ether reasons I would suggest Ajmere as the most suitable place. The state will provide any necessary allowances which the principal of the College should think necessary for his position. He would take with him servants from here, but it is very doubtful if there is any person from the state who is qualified in any way to act as his guardian. For this reason I would advocate his being put under the personal care of one of the English masters. In view of p ssible delay I am sending a copy of this letter to the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department in addition to the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad. I would request tnat if this proposal is approved I may be informed by telegraph and that that the Government of India will request the Principal of Chiefs' College at Ajmere to complete all necessary arrange- -ments in direct correspondence with me. I have the honour to be Sir your most ohedient servant political Agent, Muscat.

I have the honour to refer to my letter No«898 dated the 28th April 1920 on the subject of the desire of the Sultaii of Muscat Sayid Telmur to abdicate from the Sultanate. I had expressed the opinion that when it came to the time fixed by the G-ovemment of India for his return to Muscat, the Sultan would twist and turn to put off the evil day. I had therefore suggested that it would be well for Government to arrive at some definite policy with regard to this very important point. The situation which I had predicted would occur has now arisen, and I think it will be clear that something must be done. On the 9th June the Sultan reported to me by wire his arrival at Karachi, and added that he would not be returning to Muscat till a few days after the Id owing to the break of the monsoon. I reported this to the Government of India with reference to replying to H.H. on behalf of his congratulations on the occasion of His Majesty's birthday. S. G. P. i. 147 a &amp; h. b. m .'s Consul, Muscat.—14-3-13. 1,440. I - II II 1 . ■■■ 57 This , 111 waB perfectly clear was only the prelule to fArther excuses. On the 20th June I received a wire from the Sultan stating that he was retained In l^jscat under doctor's orders and that he was writing to me fully. As the wazlr Captain Maccollum was passing through Karachi on leave I instructed him to wire me his opinion on the attitude of the Sultan on the question of his eventual return to Muscat as shown from his conversation with the wazlr generally. He was of course In no way to betray that he knew anything of the Sultan's intentions or of his jam* previous application 'to the Viceroy* Yesterday I received a wire from the wazir that the Sultan showed no Intention of returning to Muscat and that he was of opinion that the Sultan's mind was still running on abdication. Today I have received the letter refered to by the Sultan in his telegram. It is written in his own hand and I append a translation. Comment on this would be superfluous. It is an open statement that he will do his best never to return to Muscat. I have already placed on ay record my views on the whole question. I have nothing to add except that a large tribal agtherlng has been convened at Semail to discuss the course of action to be adopted by the Omanlts owing to the imposition of the penal zakat. It is impossible at present to say which way the cat will jump, they may come to tame terms or they may in an access of madness make an attack on Matrah, The latter could in all probability be dealt with without difficulty. But should the Omanis approach me as regards terms. It is scarcely necessary to point out 0 even Xf I how much stronger my position would be if I knew RM cou n o communicate the intentions of government as regards t Sultan, o ^ have the honour to be Sir your most obedient servanJ^J),... ttr Cu^it CciuiuOJCcuu y tTranslation of a letter dated Karachi 29th Ramazan 1335 ( 17th June 1920 ) received the 25th June 1920 from Telmur bin Faisal bin Turkl, Sultan of Muscat to Mr.Wlnsate H.B.M's Consul, Muscat. After compllmentB. I had already sent a telegram when I reached Karachi and mentioned In It briefly the impossibility of my returning to Muscat in these days. The reason of this is that when I reached Karachi I put myself under a doctor for treatment In order that I maght be cured of the diseases which I have had for a long time and of whose bad consequences I have long been afraid. Now I am in the habds of a doctor and I therefore inform Government of the cause of this delay. In the second place It is not a secret a doctor's treatment must take time, and I have a medical certificate to this effect. Undoubtedly Government will not endanger my health ( lit. will not allow the badness of my health ), and It would be a great benefit to me If I could be cured of these diseases of mine. It may be known to you that I do not Intend to return to Muscat till the treatment finishes. I have already mentioned this delay to the Commissioner here. It is necessary that I Should mention the matter to you fully also that you may know.

To The Deputy Political Resident, lushire* Sir, 1 have the honour to refer to my letter So, 4«9 da dated #th Teloruary 1920 on the suTsject of the financial position of the Muscat State* In this letter I stated that it appeared from the letters interchanged between my predecessor and H.H. the Sultan on the subject of the loan that on 1st Deoeiriber 1920 a sum of R8 5S,250/- coicprising Rs39,000/- interest and RsIfij250/» first instalment of principal would be due from t the Muscat State to the Government of India. I have now made out a table of payments of which I attach a copy due from the Muscat State in liquidation of the loan of Ra lakhs* It will 'be seen froci this ta'ble that a very heav^ burden is placed upon the State during the first few years, years in which the State will be struggling to make both ends meet arai to provide large sums of money for essential initial expenditure in addition to meeting the ordinary recurring expenses of administration. In my letter No. 2354 dated 28th November 1919 I had based my calculations for the repayment of the loan on Appendix N of volume II of the Civil Account Code. In accordance with this equal instalments of Rs43,«90,4 are due every half year. It will be seen that if the Government of India A 'X, sanctionsanction this method of repayment, the first instalment not tieiEg payable till after a year in accordance with the terms of the loan instead of after six months, the State will only have to pay Rs 1,81,MUZ upto acd including the 3rd payment due on 1st Decemher 1921, instead of Rs1,6#,»12 /8/- under the present conditions. This saving of a quarter of a lakh in this most critical financial year is a matter of great importance to this struggling State. I venture to hope that you will recemmend this method of repayment to the Government of India, in view of the efforts that are feeing made to make this backward State pay its way. It will he within your recollection that the loan granted is a dead loss asfar as the State is concerned It just paid the Sultan's debts ( actually over Rs«,000/- short ) and left not a penny which might have been spent in initial expenditure and reforms which would have proved remunerative later on* I have the honour to 'be* Sir f Yot ' nt ® Political Agent and H .l .H's Consul, Muscat.3tfa- From To No* of 1920.

Sir, I have the honour to forward a revised list of the recurring monthly expenditure of the Muscat State , prepared under my instructions by the Waiir to H.H. the Sultan of Muscat. Bvery payment including H.E. the Sultan's privy purse is contained in this list « The original list presented by the Sultan in October estimated the monthly payment at Rs§7,700/- including his privy purse of Rsl0,000 per mensem. Tfc« revised list therefore only actually shows a saving of Rs4700/- per mensem but the following remarks will show the very large economies that have really been made;- (1) In the Sultan's original list no provision is made for miscellaneous expenditure. Rs4,661/~ is provided monthly in therevised list. (2) The items starred, mostly salaries of establish- -ments at outside ports were not included in the Sultan's list. The Walis did what they liked, pocketed such income as there was themselves and met expenditure by the pernicious system of drafts on the local port customs, leaving it to the Sultan to pay up later. Ho employee was ever paid* This has now all been regularised and salaries are paid punctually and regularly fro® Muscat, to the contentment of all concerned. The salaries included th e first time in the(5) Lf the civil list amount to RglS,316/- and dollars 100/- per mens em# (3^ ) As an instance of the state of affairs prevalent till quite recently, it was found that Mohomed Reimoo the farmer of the Gwadur Customs was supplying rations , 'buhta, etc, to the Sultan's palace and Muscat and Muttra establishments at the rate of Rs 12,000/- per mensem* The ration list was revised and the amount slightly reduced by about 10 per cent» Nasib, the naval contractor was then gjdiven the contract and is supplying the rations for between Rs3,000/- and Rs4,000/- per mensem^ ( Hote # « these rations are included in several items in the list of payments )♦ Over a lakh of rupees a year has been saved by this alone. After the preparation of this list news was received from jbhe Sultan fixing the allowance of Saiyid Nadir fa j 2, rfT. at per Diensem instead of Rs2,S*00/- per mensem as formerly» I have the honour to be.

A copy of Political gent Muscat's letter dated 28th April 898 was sent to India, Office and Simla under our no,14264 of 12tli May, IB Givcom®I1 L CdicMul 1 ^ 2nd July 1920 X-o to- y Th6 question of the Sultan is really I think becoming serious. You may remember that I told you on the Lawrence that I was sure that he would make every effort not to return, and it was for this reason that I hoped that Government would consider the matter seriously. It is very difficult for Government to make him return. Faced with the plea of illness they can practically do nothing. Meanwhile 8$? attitude may very likely be misinterpreted. Officially I have given my views. The reasons why he does not wish to return are fairly obvious. Like all of us he is Idle with a tendency to European luxury. He has no use whatever for ruling his very difficult state. He Is hated by his subjects and by his family. The former hate him because of the misrule of his early years and because of his obvious unsuitability as a ruler. Nothing that we can do wilx ever regain him the love or respect of his subjects. The latter hate him because thfcy are not Sultans and because they regard him simply as a means by which they can obtain money and oppress the people. Now that their depredations have been largely curtailed and their allowances fixed they devest him the more. Of all this beir^/no fool he is perfectly well aware. He without'«ears agination if he returns and from the records of his family this fear is not without a great deal ' of justification. With his son in and a council of regency which would not contain one of his brothers there would be a chance of reestablishing the popularity of the dynasty a certain measure of popular support. It is even ju^t po that some of the great chiefs of the interior would serve on the council (it is only a question of sufficlenTmoney for them)• if ! . . 1 U ym 11 i mm ( VQuite clearly in the event of a change in the succession it would be futile to consult the wishes of the tribes. The Imam has definitely proved himself beyond the pale, and I thiflte that most even of the Omanis realise this. Besides we have set our hand to the plough and we cannot turn back. Once we have made the coastal government strong enough to guard itself and to keep up a semblance of administration we can let the whole show rip and withdraw the P.A.even, replacing him by a consul from among the Indian merchants. Provided there was a council of regency I would not have the British adviser a member as I first suggested. Keep it entirely Arab. The wazir can exercise quite enough power through inspection and advice. Besides as long as there is a wazir there will be a P.A. and he could keep the council in order. I imagine the difficulty in taking any steps with regard to the Sultan is the general nervousness of Government in taking any action at present remotely connected with Arabian or Moslem politics, and uncertainty as to the attitude of the French. In any case it looks as if I shall have to see the Sultan again in India and fix up something, but I have n t the least idea what is the policy of aovemmert I may be able to deal with him. Probably noone else can. It is just possible that I amta unduly pessimistic about the attltide of the S u 3.tan, but I lo not think that it Is likely. The sltuat on In the Interior Is most interesting. At the present moment my mind is rather exercised as to what Government are going to do with me.7* Telegram Code# .1 Prom - Foreign, Simla# To - Political, Bushire* Repeated Muscat. So. 1073-E.A.

The Government of India have been warned that thl« situation would be inevitable see my despatch dated the 38th April and my despatch dated the 26th June, An independent ruler with a medical certificate is difficult to move. I would sugseet my proceeding to Karachi after a p»riod of ten days or four- -teen lays by which time I should have clear Indication of the line affairs are taking in the Interior. I can endeavour t® p »rsuade him to return for a few days when he can appoint on ray advice a Council of Regency to act till he really returns. I can hold out no hopes that he will return at present unless it Is conditionally for a short time nor can we exert pressure fcn him as we have n#t a leg t© stand on. The policy by which European officer act d for him during his absence for three months produced good effect but vallie will be lost if this should be continued Indefinitely and will in addition be liable to misinterpretation. I would suggest wazir being made minister In council in charge of finance and the army. Exact members of council and the pre- - sident cannot be stated till I have discussed the question with the Sultan and ontained his consent to the conditions. Sultan could then return to India openljs to continue his cure and his return for one week personally to arrange ad- -mini strati on during his further absence will have good effecl® Copies by post for information to The Civil Commissioner Baghdad fiie Deputy Political Resident Bu«hlr« The Deputy Secretary to the Gevernment of Ii a / Foreign and political Department, Simla21st July 1920 'Q_Oul I tJLl/C.\ With reference to the question of the Sultan and whether he returns for a short time and there is to he a sort of council to carry on while he is away, which I consider ia the only possible course, you may think it worth while to consider the question of Maccollum. As far as I can make out he has been appointed wazir to the Sultan of Muscat, a position that obviously he could not hold under a regency council,It might be therefore necessary to consult him as to whether he would consent to serve on as minister in charge of the army and finance. His position would be very little different from what it was before, except that in this case he would be acting according to the orders of a council on the spot insteaa of on the supposed orders of the Sultan in India. In these circumstances if it should be decided to bring the Sultan back for a short period almost at once it might be better for Maccollum to accompany the Sultan Sums when he returns, i.e. not to return before him. I shall have interviewed the Sultan and returned presumably myself, and such an arrangement would I think have the bes^ general However I have not the least idea as yet what it is intended to do, so the above is merely a tentative suggestion.

The following proposals have been discussed by the Government of India with the Political Agent, Muscat, We would be very pleased to have your views. (1), That the Sultan should be allowed to abdicate in favour of his son,who would be installed in his place with a eouncil Regency. (2). That he should not abdicate but be allowed to live out of Muscat for the most of each year. The Government of the country would then be carried on by a Council of Ministers, (3). That he should be made to return and live in his country permanently. The Government of India are inclined to favour the second proposal. They are opposed to the first because onsing to the present delicate Arab and Moslem situation, the abdication of the Sultan would certainly be attributed to wrong motives and would be severely criticised both in India and Arania. he third possibility seems an undesirable solution even were it possible, as it would mean a discontented,useleas and obstructivl ruler living in Muscat, A subsidiary question is that of sending Captain MoCollum back to hai) work in Muscat. The Government of India would be pleased to have your views about this also.

D.F*5«. According to the instructions contained in F.S, note of 3rl Septamber I interviewed His Hi hness the Sultan of Muscat in the Circuit Hou«e at Ambala today. His Hi^imess had arrived the night before with his Secretary Khan Bahadur Ahmed Shubeili from Kashmir, and owing to hie habit of trave ling incognito had not had a very pleasa nt time in Ambala, obtaining accomodation in theE Civil and Military Hotel where by chance I found him. His Highness has changed greatly in appearance wearing ( habitually I understand ) European clothes and a sheepskin fez. He has also trimmed his beard. Both these actions are of course heinous offences in the eyse of the Ibadhi sect of Islam to which he belongs, and which preserves to the better the Koranic instructions on these points. The interview lasted six hours and was extremely trying. His highness showed a mulelike obsti acy in sticking to xiis original request to abdicate at all costs, and on this point as on the subject of appointing an administrative council instead of a British wazir, very considerable persuasion had to be used. His attitude was a combination of terror at having to return to Muscat even for a day and of a pathetic desire to get as much money out of his state as possible for his own personal use. By playing on these two obviously incompatible points of view it was possible to secure his consent to the the important points demanded in the note, though it will be seen that he has put in a request that his yearly stay in Muscat should be only a couple of months. In view of his attitude I considered it advosable to get him to write me a letter explaining his attitude and the steps he intended to take to arrange for an administrative council. This I enclose for reference. He also gave me for personal delivery to the Wali of Muttrah who is in charge of the state at present a(1 letter contlaning his Instructions on the latter rjoint. It will be seen that in his letter (l) He accepts the coniition that he must resile a portion of the year in Muscat, but asks that the period may be shortenel.

This council is to continue its functions even when he is in Muscat.

(2) Gwadur. Without my mentioning the subject he brought this up and proved anxious to include Gwadur in the Muscat customs control. This will solve the G-wadur problem from the Muscat point of view - which was purely the problem of why this lucrative source of revenue should be used as a private estate This will greatly inerease the revenue of the state and do away with the regime of Mohammed Remoo. This change of control is to take place on the Sultan's return. (3) Recognition of Saiyid Said as his heir. He was very anxious about lihis. I replied that I would in no way commit Government on this point but that at his k request I woulad bring up the point before Government.

Saiyid Said is his only possible successor but whether we could give such an assurance is beyond my purview. (4) His residence in India.

He then asked if G-overnment would lend him the money - presumably with the extra security of the Gwadur custom*.

There were other points about allowances to certain members of his family which he asked me to arrange with this administrative council which it is unnecessary to mention.

His fear was that he himsel/ might be badgeFdd and that though as a puppet Sultan in name he didi not mind being controlled by us, he did not like the idea of being contrtlled financially above all by his relations He was told however that this subject could not be reopened and was somewhat reassured when reminded of the financiii control exercised by the P.A. under the terme of the loan. He unquestionably wished to throw the whole burden and responsi- -bility on the British Government, and this transparently obvious wish of hi« is an additional proof of the necessity for not committing ourselves further.isrjq pfo Zob'Lf British Gonaulate and Political Agency Muscat, 12th October 1920. ^ From 3?^ R.E.L.Winsate Esq. I.C.S, political Asent and H.B.M 1 # Consul, Muscat. To The Deputy political Resident, Bushlre. I I s Sir, I have the honour to forward a report on the finances of the Muscat State from the Ist October 1919 to the 30tb September 1920. This financial year Is taken as It was from the 1st October 1919 that the reform of the state was taken In hand, and control over the finances was exercised by the political Agent under the terms of the loan. A preliminary budget for the financial year 1st October 1920 to the 30th September 1921 is ^ forw|^ed^ I would refer to my letters No. 2336 dated 28 /11/19 n« M / FINANCIAL YEAR Ist OCTOBER 1919 TO 30th SEPTEMBER 1920 t The State startJt*® the year with nothing whatever in the treasury. In fact It may have been said to have started with less than nothing as the Sultan's debts even after making heavy discount for Immediate payment amounted to R8.e ,56,165/-, towards which Government granted a loan of Rs.6,50,000/-, leaving RS.M6165/- to be met from the state treasury. In addition to this the Sultan apparently approprlat- -ed the subsidy paid on the 1st October, which should have been credited to the state treasury to his own use. The state therefore really started the year with a debit balance of between Rs .28,000/- and Rb .21,000/''. At the end of the current financial year the treasury Is able to show a credit balance of Rs.3,51,618/-. It Is worthy of remark that this satisfactory result has been attained In spite of extremely adverse conditions, namely the!( restriction on the export of rice from India, the troubles at gur f-nd other towns of the coast which lost the state almost a iakh of income, and the continued hostility of the Interior whic^ resulted in something like a blockade and was a great hindrance to trade. On the other hand the State in the last month was able to make a considerable amount out of the penal zakat. The Income and expenditure during the year were R8.11,65,386/- and Re.8,13,774/- respectively. In the prelimin were -ary budget which I submitted the figures Rs»10,76,400/« and Ra.tx 9,01,280/- respectively, while in the revised budget which I submitted they were Rs.8,86,400/- and Rs # 8,31,530/-« It will thus be seen that the expenditure has been practically the same as that estimated in the revised budget, while the income has been RB.90,000/ rt more than that estimated in the original budget. Turning to the details of income and expend!- -ture it will be seen that customs receipts from all sources total Rs.8,88,680/- ( Rs.8,13,515/- from Muscat and Muttrah and Rs.75,165/- from other ports ), as compared with an estimate of Rs.8,90,000/- ( Rs.7,40,000/- from Muscat and Muttrah and Rs.1,50,000/- from other ports ). The increase of income at Muscat has therefore compensated for the loss of income caused by the troubles at Sur and elsewhere# The subsidies as explained above show Rs.15,530/- less fcxaJat than was expected» Quarantine receipts and landing charges total Rs.6830/«. Miscellaneous receipts total Rs.99,046/-» This sum includes the sale proceeds of the Nur-al-Eahr and of certain surplus state stores, farms of state gardens, fines etc. Expenditure underthe head Sultan's privy purse amounts to Rs.1,20,000/- as estimated in the original budget. During the months May to August H.H.'s privy purse had been reduced to R b .5000/- p.nu owing to the condition of the state finances at that time. The British advisor had however givento H.H» in writing that if the finances of the state at the eni of the year permitted it he should be paid at the rate of Rs#10,C0O/» p*nu including arrears. Under these circumstancei the full payment has been made# Allowances to members of the royal family and administrative charges need no comment. The various changes which have occurred have been fully explained in my letter No. 1385 of the 23rd June 1920* The Masnaah, Hazm and Rostaq affairs cost the state Rs.52,79C/-. Miscellaneous expenses were Rs.1,02,139/-. These latter include some advances given by the state which are recoverable# PRELIMINARY BUDGET FOR THE YEAR 1st 0CT0BSR1920 TS 30th SEPTEMBER 1921. Including the opening balance from last year of r8 .3 # 51,600/- the estimated income is R«•17,74.000/- # while the estimated expenditure is Rs.11,61,480/-, giving an estimated closing balance at the end of the year of Rs.6,12,520 The estimated receipts from customs and the zakat have been increased by over three lakhs to R b .12,00,000/*** The possibility of the removal of the embargo on the export of rice from India, the certain boom in trade which will be caused by the peace with the interior, and the probability of a more efficient customs control which will probably include the port of Q-wadur do not make this estimate excessive. On the expenditure side the first charge on the revenues is the repayment of two instalments amounting to Rs.93,480/- of the loan granted by Government. In items (3) (4) and (7) ample allowance has been made for possible increases. Rs.78,000/- has been provided under the heading marine charges. This includes initial expenditure of Rs. 60000/- on the purchase of a motor cruiser and a motor boat and recurring expenditure of Rs.l500/-p-a.(ICS HI R8 .i ,85,000/- has been provided under the heading military charges. It is assumed that the Levy Corps will not arrive here till January, and a recurring expenditure of R0*i6,OOO/« p»Di* for nine months together with an initial expenditure of R8.50,000/- has been budgetted for. -aneous it is hoped to provide funds for starting and staffing a good school* with a certain amount of confidence. Finances will still however have to be husbanded with care and for several years It will be inadvisable to incur initial expenditure which is not urgently necessary or which does not secure an early return The following schedules are attached, (X) Classified receipts month by month from October 1919 tp September 1920• (2) Classified expenditure month by month from October 1919 to September 1920t (3) Preliminary budget for the year 1st October 1930 to 30th September 1921# The other items need no comment.

Secretary Khan Bahadur Ahmed Shubeili from Kashmir, and owing to his habit of travelling incognito had not had a very pleasant time'in Ambala, obtaining accommodation in the Civil and Military Hotel where by chance I found him. His Highness has changed greatly in appearance wearing (habitually I understand) European clothes and a sheepskin fez. He has also trimmed his beard. Both these actions are of course heinous offences in the eyes of the Ibadhi sect of Islam to which he belongs, and which preserves to the letter the Koranic instructions on these points. The interview lasted six hours and was extremely difficult and trying. His Highness showed a mule like obstinacy in sticking to his original request to abdicate at all costs, and on this point as on the subject of appointing an administrative council instead of a British Wazir, very considerable persuasion had to be used. His attitude was a combination of terror at having to return to Muscat even for a day and of a pathetic desire to get as much money out of his State as possible for his own personal use. By playing on the^se two obviously incompatible points of view it was possible to secure his consent to the important points demanded in the F.S's n ote, though it will be seen that he has put in a request that his yearly stay in Muscat should only^a couple of months. In view of his attitude I considered it advisable to get him to Wr ite me a letter explaining his attitude and the steps he intended take to arrange for an administrative council. This I enclpse for reference. He also gave me for personal delivery to the Wali Mattrah who is in charge of the state at present a letter His Highness had arrived the night before with his containingi?L containing Ms instructions on the latter point. It will be seen that in his letter (1) He accepts the condition that he must reside a portion of the year in Muscat, but asks that the period may be It was impossible to move him on this point, and in view of the great difficulty I had in securing his consent to the others I let it pass, compromising that his acceptance should talce the form of a request, it being left to Government to decide. Personally I venture the opinion that it does not much matter. He is determined to do nothing, and nothing usefnl can be done by him. He might be made to stay three months. 1 reply is necessary on this point. (2) He has given orders for the formation of an administrative council, and has placed all matters except those mentioned in (3) of P.S. note in its hands, thereby fulfilling conditions (2) and (3) of P.S. note. This council is to continue in its functions even when he is in Muscat. (3) I did not think it necessary for him to put his acceptance of condition (4) of F.S. note in writing as this follows automatically, and he became almost hysterical at the thought that he should ever even contemplate returning to Muscat permanently. (4) He has given me a free hand in the negotiations with the Omanis. It was very important to have this in writing, and , owing to his hatred of them and his sense of pride it was a very difficult point to gain. (5) He hopes Government will continue to assist him. (6) He announces his return to Muscat for November. shortened. This is suitable. (7) He asks for a ship to take him as this will be his formal return. If one is available and going up the Gulf there would be no in granting this request. isis regards his letter to the Wali of Mattrah authorising [ the institution of an advisory council, no comment is necessary. The responsibility of inaugurating this council harmoniously is the Political igent's. The whole interview only confirmed the impression of the utter uselessness of this vain and idle puppet. Only outside political considerations of the higest importance can permit him to remain even as a Sultan only in name. Other poin ts raise d bv H.H. during the intervifiw , (1) llisjrivy purse. This has been reduced from Rs.10,000/- to Rs» 5,000/— p#iiu and he was anxious to have it raised ag'ain# He was told by me that the first financial year under the reforms would end on 30th September and that the position of the State would be reviewed and he would be informed accordingly. (2) Gwadur, ?/ithout my mentioning the subject he brought this up and proved anxious to include Gwadur in the Muscat customs control. This will solve the Gwadur problem from the Muscat point of view- ffhich was purely the problem of why this lucrative source of revenue should be used as a private estate. This will greatly increase the revenue of the State and do away with the regime of Mohamed Remoo. This change of control is to take place on the Sultan's return. (3) Beco^nition of Sayid Said Nisseri as his heir . He was very anxious about this. I replied that I would in no way commit Government on this point but that at his request I would bring up the point before Government. What is at the bottom of his mind in this case is that if anything should happen to him we should not appoint one of his brothers. Sayid Said is his only possible successor but whether We could give such an assurance is beyond my purview. (4) Sis. residence in India . He is anxious to have a permanent pied a terr e in*India W-s mind seems to run on Dehra Dun or Bangalore. This is probably ^sirable if he is going to reside over half the year in India. ^ is at least better than his wandering incognito over the whole peninsula. His idea is to buy a small house. He calculates that WfosX this witt 1 furniture will cost Mm Bs. 50,000/-. I informed , state finances could not possibly bear this charge tjjis year. He then asked if Government would lend him the money - presumably with the extra security of the Gwadur customs. I replied I had no idea and did not think it very likely. Probably the best reply would be to say that he should rent a house for a year pending the result of the next financial year with Gwadur thrown in. (5) A very minor point - he wants a license to buy a sporting rifle and 400 cartridges. There were other points about allowances to certain members of his family which he asked me to arrange with his administrative council which it is unnecessary to mention. He expressed considerable apprehension at the non-return of Captain McGollum. His fear was that he himself might be badgered and that though as a puppet Sultan in name he did not mind being controlled by us, he did not like the idea of being controlled financially above all, by his relations. He was told however that this subject could not be reopened and was someirhat reassured when reminded of the financial control exercised by the P.A. under the terms of the loan. He unquestionably wished to throw the whole burden and responsibility on the British Government, and this transparently obvious wish of his is an additional proof of the necessity for not committing ourselves further.Translation of a letter from His Highness the Sultan of' Maskat to Muhammad bin ihraad bin Nasir, Yazir, Maskat State, dated the 8th September 1920 corresponding to _x_ Dhil Huij 1338. ^fter compliments . I write to inform yon that I do not propose going to Maskat for the present, as while there I could never keep good health and always suffered from ill-health. On my arrival in India I consulted the doctors, who after treating my complaints told me that the climate of Maskat will not suit my health. But (of course) T must return to Maskat every year for a short period. I have decided to create a f Majlis-al-Yizarat' (Council of Ministers) for conducting my Government which should meet twice a week, and have appointed 4 persons for the purpose charged with the responsibility of the good government of my State, excluding (from their jurisdiction) certain (class of) affairs which I will indicate on my arrival at Maskat in November next. I now desire that you should carry out my order stated above. The Council will consist of my brother Nadir, Muhammad bin ihmad Vali of Matrah, Shaikh Rashid bin Aziz and Haji Zubair bin ALi. My brother Nadir will be the President of the Council, but he will have no special authority (independent of the Council) except with the concurrence of all the 4 persons, each of whom will have equal vote. In certain important matters the representative of the British Government at Maskat should be consulted. This Council will conduct the affiars of the State during my absence from Maskat, and all State matters shall be referred to them and the responsibility will rest with them, as it is now.Translation of a letter dated, Umbala, the Sth September 1920, corresponding to _x_ Dhil Hujj 1338, from His Highness the Sultan of Maskat to Mr. (R.E.L.) Wingate, His Britannic Majesty 's Consul (and Political 4gent) at Maskat. compliments . With reference to the conversation we had at Umballa on the 8th September 1920 on the question of my return to Maskat, I beg to say that I have already informed yon before that I do not at all wish to return to Maskat owing to the unsatisfactory state of my health and because I am always ailing at that place. I also explained this, through you, to the (jovernment (of India) while I was at Delhi. You have now informed me that the. Government cannot agree to this except (on condition) that I made some other arrangements in this matter, igreeably to the views of the Government, and in order to comply with its wishes as far as I can in regard to my returning to Maskat for a time, I (propose to) go there for two months every year. You have told me that the Government desires that I should go to Maskat (and stop there) for 4 or 5 months every year. But I find it will suit me and my health better (if I did) as I have stated above, and I have no doubt that the Government and His Excellency the Viceroy will not agree to see me suffer. (Pray) communicate this from me to the Foreign Secretary. I also beg to inform you that in regard to the affairs of my Government, I have written to the Vazir at Maslcat, Muhammad bin Ahmad bin Nasir, to the effect that I have appointed 4 persons to work in consultation in the office of the Yazir, as is done at present at Maskat. The 4 persons are Muhammad bin ihmad bin Nasir, Yali of Matrah, my brother Nadir, Shaikh Rashid bin Aziz and Zubair bin ALi. They will have executive powers for the good government of the country, but they will have no authority whatsoever to interfere m matters concerning me personally or those of my family, noi shall th y usurpusurp the State or the lands belonging to the State. I beg you will kindly communicate this to the Government for its acceptance. I have no doubt that the Government will accept this (arrangement) and instruct the Consul at Maskat to refer all matters (direct) to the Yizarat of my Government after the date of this letter. I have understood all you have told me in regard to my rebel subjects among the Oman people and I thank the Government (for it) and no doubt you will look into the matter yourself. I have already in the past given you my views on the question, and I fully realise it is an important matter. (But) the Government will deal justly in this important matter and is to be relied upon in its opinion on this question. I beg Of the Government to continue to extend its help and favour to my Government, as it has done in the past, and I trust this will continue for ever. I (propose to) leave India for Maskat at the end of November next in order to spend the time I have agreed to do there. I beg that the Government will kindly appoint a ship for me to carry me (to Maskat). Tr to iy.Telegram •Code. prom - Praser, Bushire. To - Political, Muscat.

I.C.S, | kkKK fetiirtrti'i i'i rurti • ' r i • .i**aBs«'A&gt;.' Political Agent and Coneul, Muscat. To The Deputy political Resident, Bushire, Sir, In confirmation of my telegram No.1987 dated 7th October I have the honour to report that according to the order# of Hie Highness the Sultan of Muscat contained in his letter dated the 8th September to Muhammad bin Ahmad, acting wazir of the Muscat state, of which a translation is attached, a Council of Minister# has been formed to carry on the administration of the State both during the absence of H.H. from Muscat and also while he is in residence there. This Council formally assumed its functions on the 7th October. ( Note. In the translation of the letter first made the important words ' and on my return also 11 occurring after the words ' during my absence from Muscat 11 in the last sentence were Inadvertently omitted. ) Of these new arrangement# His Highness Informed Government through me in his letter dated the 8th September, a translation of which is attached. The Council 1 b composed as follows, Salyid Nadir bin Faisal, brother of the Sultan, president. Saiyld Muhammad bin Ahmad, Wall of Muttrah and late acting wazir. Revenue Minister. Sheikh Rashid bin Uzzalz, Qazi of Muscat, Minister for Religious Affairs. Hajl Zubelr Mn All, Judge of the Mahkamah or Court of Justice Minister of Justice. A secretary to the Council has been appointed whose duties are to record the decisions of the Council andto prepare the necessary letters and orders for signature. The Council meets twice a week, on Mondays and Thursdays. At the meetings all political matters and other affairs of importance are discussed and decided. The ministers continue throughout to carry out their own specific duties, and within certain roughly defined and understood limits are fully responsible in their own spheres. The fact that any extraordinary or unauthoried action by them will at once be lenown and will be liable to be discussed and possibly reversed t,y the Council is sufficient check against the abuse of their separate authorities. The president has no more power than the other ministers. His chief function is to represent the Sultan on all official occasions. In addition he has been entrusted by the Council with the authority to sign all pamsports and permits for travellers and dhows. The appointment of a member of the Royal family as president was necessary in order to retain the prestige c£ the family in Muscat. It cannot be said that Saiyid Nadir possesses any great qualifications, but he is the best the family can do # and under the late regime he had not been treated very wellt. The personalities of the members of the Council very largely curtail any powers for evil that he may have. The Council acts as a court of appeal in the place of the Sultan in the few instances when appeals are made. The Walis of the coast towns and the public have been informed of the institution of the Council under the orders of the Sultan, and that they should address all letters and receive all orders in the future from the Council of Ministers of the Sultan. The British Consulate also now corresponds directly with the Council of Ministers. The Council is only Just beginning its work, and w ith the natural lack of experience of the members matters are proceeding slowly and everything is as yet not perfectly adjusted.The members are however showing a certain amount ofkeenness and a commendable desire to make an attempt at administration. They will for some time however need a considerable amount of guidance and advice. This the Political Agent is entitled to give under the terms of our asreementi W itii Muscat. At the present moment the Council is if anything too prone to ask the Political Agent's advice on almost everything. By giving advice on important matters and with- -holiing it on trivial matters, it is hoped that they will eventually lose their fear of responsibility and attain some self -reliance. The opposing personalities of the members of the Council practically insure* that no member will ever* become all powerful. I have the honour to be Sir, your most obedient servant political Agent, Muscat^ Copy to The Deputy Secretary to the Q-ovemment of India Foreign and political Department, Simla.I iio| Tr(Ufl8 i a tlon of a letter from His Hi «ime«s the Sultxfl of uucat to lohnnmad bin Ahmad bin laair, Vaair, Muscat State, doted the 8th September 1930 corresponding to— xhil Ha J J 1338.

As you are aware .of the three Customs officials who originally cam^ ^ ^ IQ^ from Egypt only'T4r, Ahdul Salam Effendi Gha,nim ^remains as Director-Creneral of Customs • This gentleman has signed a two year contract which terminates in October 1921 and he has stated to me that he intends, subject to his health remaining normal, to remain in Muscat till the expiry of his contract though should he contemplate renewing his contract he intends to take some two or three months 1 leave in Egypt during the course of the next hot weather. Of the 5 Customs officials sent from Baghdad one has already been returned and one will shortly be returned♦ It is possible that the services of the remaining three may be kept, but not one of them is capable of under- - taking Mr. Abdul Salam 1 s duty even for a day. It is there- -fore clearly imperative that arrangements should be made, if possible immediately, for securing the services of one or possibly two ■gastsausx competent Customs officials from Sgypt, Sudan or Zanzibar* Mr.I 'v3^ M Mr. Abdul Salam informs me that he knows of several capable men in Egypt who might be willing to serve in Muscat on 2 year contract with the option of renewal jkx in the same way as Mr. Abdul 'alam. Pay from R s 400/. to R s 500/- per mensem aeording to qualifications anfi terms siniilar to those offered to Mr. Abdul Salarru Would it be possible therefore for you to get into communication with the Sudan Agent on the subject. The latter or the Director General of Customs in Egypt has a copy of Gut contract which will be available from that officer. m f His Highness' government suggest advertising through S I the medium of the press in Zanzibar for certain officials of lower grade. I shall be glad if you will instruct me if you consider this advisable and if I should take up the matter with the Resident of Zanzibar on behalf of His Highness' Govern- -ment • In view of the considerable time that these matters take to arrange and of the necessity of having a competent man who can take Mr. Abdul flam's place by March 1921 . I 8ll ould be grateful should you be able to take the matter in hand as soon as possible* I have the honour to be.

Six clerks are wanted. They should be Arabs knowing how to read and write Arabic well and with a good knowledge of arithmetic. They need have had no previous acquaintance with customs work, and need m know no English, though men with these qualifications would of course be welcoiae. The pay proposed is Rs.iOO/-' to Rs .200/» p.®. The exact pay to be given would be decided after experience of their qualifications and abilities. There is also prospect of very early promotion to the Rs.200/- to Rs.30o/- grade. ExpenBes of travelling to Muscat would of course be borne by the Muscat Government. The Muscat Crovemment would also be prepared to offer special terms to specially qualified and experienced ®en In Customs work, if two such men are available. I should be most grateful if you could xk in way assist in obtaining the services of such men, or in Ringing to the notice of the public that such appointments ftre open, if you could communicate with me telegraphically 8 ^ould it be possible to find any suitable men it would be of great assistance to the Muscat Government who are very|hor t of such perBonn*!.

I,C.S # Political Agent and H.B.M's Consul, Muscat, Ueut-Colonel A.P♦Trevor C.S.I. G # I.E, Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf I venture to set down for your information a few observations on the present condition and possible future divclopment of the towns of Muscat and Muttrah. At the present ffloaent change is taking place so rapidly, and the direction of this change Is so clearly indicated that it behoves (JovernBient to take into consideration what this ehange means as far as their own interests are concerned, and to prepare for it. well known, a fine deep water harbour sheltered from all ixkk winds except the north easily defended against aftbaek from the sea and almost inaccessible from the land side, and the actual geographical position of the town at the entrance of the Persian Gulf which gave ts its possessor the command of the trade from India to the Gulf ports, and in the days of sailing vessels made it an indispensable emporium where the aerehandise brought from India in one season of the year could await the favourable winds that would carry it up the Gulf later. steamers in the Gulf killed Muscat as an emporium for all •xcept the small ports of the Oman and Mekran coasts, and for the supply of the interior through the neighbouring port of Muttrah from which the caravan roads start. Vested interests however die hard and the process oil decay though visible was •low, and this process was ggimiifrsfrgftjr arrested at the end of Bushire. The factors which caused the growth of Muscat are The advent of steam and of a regular line ofl ast oentxxrj by the temporary and artificial prosperity toro ught to Muscat by the arms traffic. Our operations against gun running and the ^jtollahment of the Arms Warehouse in 1911 largely curtailed trils trade, and the late war which caused the complete cessation of the import of arms into Muscat and the Arms Oonvention of 1919 which placed Muscat within the prohibited a m« gave the final blows to the Arms Traffic, which at the present time is non-existent and not likely to reyive. During the last six years therefore Muscat has existed only as a distributing centre for supplying the needs of interior Oman, the Oman coast ports, and in a small way the M«kran and Shamal coasts. The fact that it is the only port of call for steamers has also prevented trade from entirely abandoning the port, and the immunity of the town from attacks from the interior, a somewhat Important consideration during the late rebellion, had caused several firms to retain their headquarters at Muscat. During the whole of this time however Muscat has been facing the growing competition from Muttrah. This latter port has always been the port for native sailing xwuie vessels, and the war which brought about almost a cessation of steam shipping in the Gulf gave a great impetus to dhow b@me trade. Peace which though it brought about an increase of steamersxKKm seems to have also caused a rise in freights has not altered conditions. In fact this years statistics show an increase in dhow borne trade, an increase which competent opinion considers will continue with a corresponding diminution of the steam borne trade. XiiRxixttwc Steamers will continue to be used for the export of certain kinds of dates fcnft of pomegranates, but probably for little else. It may be remembered in this connection that the voyage by dhow from Karachi in most seasons of the year ls both short and safe, and that there being no import of perishable goods time is of little importance. Under these/s conditions the matted resolves Itself int® one of freight @nly# and the smal1 ehance whleil the steamer has against the diiaw ln this respect will he seen by a coaparlsen of the ra^es for rlee whleh are Rs•«/!«/*. per bag by steamer and RB.-/13/- ^ The second factor which has favoured Mufctrah at the expense of Muscat has been the fact that Muttrah Is in direct connection with the Interior, and the starting point for caravans» All goods landed at Muscat and destined for the Interior have to be taken by sea the Intervening three miles to Muttraiu This Is an expensive proceeding, and It Is clear that such goods cannot compete with those landed direct at Muttrah. The final factor favourable to Muttrah at the expense of Muscat has only operated during the last two ionths» This has been the peace with Oman which has removed the feeling of inseeurity which had persisted even with the f presence of an Indian regiment, and whleh has opened up vistas of greatly Increased trade with the interior® All conditions therefore point to the practical extinction of Muscat In favour of Muttrah. In fact it may now be said that Muscat has n® ralson d'etre whatever. A year ago the transference of trade and popula- -tion from Muscat to Muttrah had scarcely begun. During the first eight months of the year the change was gradual and only just perceptible^ but during the last two months what was a gentle trickle has become a raging flood. When I first arrived in Muscat in October 1910 the population of the town was at least 5000# At present it is estimated at less than 1500* What I remember as a densely populated suburb fe year ago, between the Bab al Saghlr and the oonsulate garden is nowentirely empty. All have emigrated to Muttrah My head peon tells me that the quarter in which he ^•ives near Tuwian which a year ago contained over 400 persons now houses less than thirty. The once crowded cloth bazar now only contains one miserable shop. The famous goldsmithsof Muscat are reduced to two. The whole town is dead. You jaay traverse it from end to end in any direction at any hour of the day or night, and except outside the Bab al Saghir it sundown where the miserable inhabitants gather to purchase the few dates or sardines on which they subsist, you will not meet ten human beings, and the chances are that these will all be bunnias, servants of the Consulate or slaves of the Sultan. K.B.Nasib the naval contractor and the wealthiest of the Baluch community admits that the Baluch coolies have are deserted or about to desert Muscat as there is no work. The bunnias admit that it is only because they have their good houses here that they continue to live at Muscat. Their work is at Muttrah. Were the mails to call at Muttrah instead of at Muscat they would also desert in a body® Over three quarters of the houses in Muscat are empty or are falling down, Noone who wishes to seil land can find a purchaser at any price. As an instance of the fall in land values the case of Dadhabhai may be quoted. Two years ago he was anxious that Q-ovemment should purchase a house of Ms close to the Consulate, and he had asked 11,000 dollars as the price. This was probably not much in excess of the market value. Today he has failed to find a purchaser at &amp;s#5000/~, that is at less than a fifth of the price. The Director of Customs telle me that has to reorganise completely his customs arrangement®. Except for a packages from the steamer on mail days the Muscat customs is -eserted, and there is no work for the employees.At Muttrah the staff cannot cope with the work, the quays are crowded and sailing vessells have to await their turn, very often several days, to be discharged. The chief British Indian merchant in Muttrah Us me that at least five hundred Omanis arrive at and part Irom Muttrah daily, and from personal observation I hould not think that this was a exaggeration. The Sultan and his family are no longer alucrative source of revenue to the bunniaa, as their debts Have been paid and will not be paid again. Were the Consulate to be removed from Muscat it may safely be predicted that except for lizards, eats and the Sultan 1 s family Muscat would b deserted within six months« This situation which I have sketched in a manner that if anything minimises the actual, must I venture t@ think have a considerable effect upon our position in Oman territory .Muscat may be said to be suffering from an incurabl# disease, its days are numbered and we can do nothing to save It, if it is worth saving which in my opinion it most certain^ is not. We have two alternatives before us. We can either by sheer inanition decline to see the obvious and by keeping our representative at Muscat with the conveniences such as post offices and telegraphs which go with hia, cause some continuously inconvenience to trade and maintain Muscat jcKxxx}s]U&amp;xiu&amp;x&amp; KjMdtKxatxacxjglrKrtwyOTyttg in articulo mortis; or we can face the obvious and act accordingly*. The political situation which must strongly influence the consideration of this problem has lately greatly changed. We are no longer supporting a ruler who in spite of his impotence yet owing to his theoretivalj^jc independentawas in a position to cause us considerable trouble. The arms traffic is at an end, the French are closing their consulate. A Sultan with fantastic ideas about his own independence has been succeeded by an absentee 11 roi faineant 11 who wishes to leave administration in the hands of his ministers. A bankrupt and incompetent administration endeavouring to control a large and openly hostile hinterland which would have destroyed it at any moment had it not been for our support has been replaced by an administration which if only a shade less incompetent at least has a well-filled treasury, and wil it is hoped shortly have a few reliable soldiers, while it has only to extend its activities to the control of the coast towns, the menacing and embarrassing interior ruling itselfand on signed terms of peace with the Sultan's government. So has the work and the Position of the political Agent changed. Excluding his technical consular worK which of course remains the eame he is no longer the British representative at the court of an absolute though futile ruler, endeavouring to persuade him to take some measure or to meet the claims of some British subject, but the adviser of the Sultan's ministers on certain matter#, and in direct connection with the practically independent chiefs of the interior who look to his good offices to settle any point that may be at issue with the Sultan's government, as do the latter in similar case with the interior* -ing the possibility of establishing their headquarters at Muttrah where their largest customs post will be located, and where the levy will be stationed, and even if the theoretical headquarters should remain at Muscat, the greater part of the actual work will be done at Muttrah. There is no political necessity for the p.iU to remain at Muscat. In taking into consideration the possibility of a move from Muscat to Muttrah howevej 1 the cost must be counted. The Consulate buildings in Muscat are large and valuable. They consist of the Agency which in addition houses the post and telegraph offices, the house of the Agency Surgeon now owing to the absence of the top storey unlivable in, two first class clerks 1 quarters, three second class clerks 1 quarters and an sub-assistant surgeon's quarter# In addition there are the lines for the consular guard, and government may be said to possess a share in the Muscat hospital. *ould be almost prohibitive^ especially as except for the 1 material the buildings in Muscat would be a dead loss and the s He would be valueless. The Sultan's government are seriously consider- The cost ©f erecting similar buildings in Muttrah The situation may therefore be summed up as Allows;(1) Trade ifl becoming entirely centred in Muttrah at Jhe expense of Muscat. ■ (2) The local government even if it does not follow itself will do mosj of its work there. (3) The work of the Political Agent will become mostly Muttrah work for the above reasons, and for the additional reason of its connection with the interior. (4) Steamers call at Muscat and the post and telegraph offices are situated there. A demand for the maila to call at Muttrah instead of Muscat is inevitable and would certainly be a great boon to trade. There have been repeated demands for a post office to be opened there. (5) British institutions are housed in valuable In buildings in Muscat which could not be reerected at Muttrah except at a cost quite incommensurate with the importance of Oman. It therefore seems that if we are to move with the times a compromise will have to be arrived at, and I put forward the following tentative proposals for your considerate -tion. (1) A site should be obtained at Muttrah or if possible a house in which a post office could be housed and which would provide room in addition for a small political office. (2) The Political Agent should certain fixed days a week at Muttrah, including mail days. This would be a simple matter when the launch comes. (3) The resilence of the Political Agent and of most of his staff would remain at Muscat, as would also the telegraph office and one postal clerk to do the small amount of postal work. (4) Mail steamers should call at Muttrah instead of Muscat. I hope that it will be clearly understood that tnea© suggestiorls are merely tentative, and that I have only the opportunity to bring forward with some emphasis iac ts of the situation* in this part of the world, and Iventure to think that these facts are possibly unrealised, ghouli you consider that tliese facts call for some action on our part It will be possible to examine In detail any proposals which may recommend themselves to you» I have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedient servant 1% f 0' v I.C.S, V political Agent, Muscat. 1 ' 1 m IH :k British Con»ulat# ani PollUcal Ae«naj Um&amp;sX, i6th November 19@0« froa /r ' To R.IS^.Wingat# Esq* l.C.S, Politloal Agi&amp;nt anti H.B.M'si Consul, Muscat. lisut-Colon^l A.?.Trevor C # S.I, 0*1,%, Officiating Political Rculd^nt In the Gulf Buaihire* Sir, I venture to »&lt;it donn for jour information a few ob«ervatlon» on the present camlitioa m&amp; pv^tihl* futitr# d«V0lopaa«nt of th&amp; towns of Muscat and Muttrah.

The Political Agent shows that an increasingly rapid exodus from ruscat to Muttra is taking place, and that at the present rate v uacat will soon only 'be occupied by hangers-on of the sultan and the Consulate. The reasons for this exodus are clearly shown in Mr. Wingate'a letter. J'uttra is much less shut in than T'uscat, and is slightly cool or and healthier. Dr. Jayakar who was Agency surgeon at Muscat for many years always, I understand, lived at ^mttra. r. Mackirdv who also 1 ved at ' uscat for over 20 years used to spend the greater part of the hot weather at 'uttra# These facts are further reasons for the migration in addition to by those mentionod/wr.

The matter was brought before H.Ht the Sultan Immediately on his return from India at the end of last month# He expressed himself as most anxious for his som to commence his studies at Ajmere as soon as possible. He was at the same time insistent that his son should be accompanied by an Arab Sgyptian who knew Arabic well and also English, and who would be able to instruct his son in advanced Arabic and literature, proficiency in which would be essential for his future posi tion, and at the same time act as a sort of business manager or master of the household to hia.

He thereflfire hopes that Government will help him to obtain the services of such a man. and points out with truth that he himself has not the machinery to get Into touch with likely per»ons. It should not be difficult to obtain the services of a qualified Egyptian for this post which should be a very pleasant one. The tutor would presumably live with Saiyld Said and the state would offer a salary of from Rs.2oO/- to Rs.SOO/- PelQ.

I auch ragret the dalay In replying which was due to the fact that It was necessary to put this case before H.H» the Sultan himself, and he only returned fro® India on tha 38th of last month# The CustomB Administration of G -wadur has long been s source of complaint. H .H. the Sultan has Invariably kept the control of Gwadur In Ms own hands. In other words he has 4 „ • used it as a sort of private estate administered entirely •part from tho rest of his dominions through the agency of ' 1 Shammed Relmoo who Is his customs director there and who accounts for the revenues direct to the Sultan Instead of to the state treasury at Muscat. It Is true that there is a Wall at Gwadur but this official Is possessed of no power whatever In comparison to Mohaaned Relmoo. Immediately in the return of H.H. to Muscat I S. G. P. I.— 147 P. A. &amp; H. B. M.'s Consul, Muscat.— 14-3-13. 1,440. W ■ | m -called th« SultAn'• attention to the state of affairs at (jwadur and to ths repeated complaints which had been made by the mercantile community there on the subject* of the Customs Administration which had culminated in a serious complaint being made by you. H.H» at once stated that it had been his intention for some time to bring Qwadur under the central customs control at Muscat^ anl that he would take steps to bring about this change as soon ap possible. Tills means that Mohammed Reimoo will ne longer be Customs Director, that Customs officials will be appointed from Muscat and that the revenues will be credited direct to the state treasury^ This is most satisfactory and as soon as it is possible to arrange for the personnel the change will take place. This disposes of the point raised in the fifth paragraph of your ffcrst letter. I am also pressing upon the Sultan's government the desirability of prohibiting the reexport of rice from Gwadur should the stocks there be low. It does not seem that any such prohibition was ever issued by the Sultan's government, and that therefore it is techliically impossible to hold Mohammed KKa^®DUtkldt*xx Reimoo responsible. In view of the fact that he will shortly cease to hold the post of Customs Director it does not seem that further action against him is necessary as far as the Sultan's government is concerned, though of course this does not affect the light in which his action is regarded by the Government of India. Directly matters are en train for the establ- -ishment of the new Customs Administration at G-wadur I will obtain from the local government copies of all the rules and re dUlations to be enforced there anl forward them to you.

He will also be leaving Muscat at the end of March for a short period of leave in Egypt which his health urgently requires. The question of replacing him during this time and the problem of obtaining the services of other officials from the Egyptian or Sudan Governments hafe-already been taken . ^P by you. Mr.Abdul Salam, at the urgent request of thejtosest Government which I heartily endorse, has expressed his willingness to stay on another two years on a renewed contract proviied the Egyptian Crovermaent will agree to his being seconded for this furiiher period. As has already been pointed out in my letter No,3S of the 7th January 1920 to the adclresa of the Civil Commissioner Baghdai. there can be no question of arfking such officials to sever their connection with the Egyptian Qovernment ; such a course would be obviously unfair to them, nor indeed could the state hold out prospects which would in any way compensate for what such an official would have to give up in the way of pension, amenities of life, promotion and so on« In his telegram No. 1441 of the Ist Feb 1930 to the Arab Bureau the Civil Commissioner Baghdad reiter ated these views. It therefore rests with the Egyptian Government as to whether they would be willing to spare the services of this official for another period. I venture to submit the following few remarks in the hope that th« Egyptian Government will view with favour the request of the state authorities and will relax their rule in favour of another period oi seconding Muscat is an independent Islamic state, almost entirely Arab in population. It is completely self-governing but owing to the appalling system of finance prevalent was only a year ago entirely bankrupt. By far the greatest source of revenue is from the customs. The reform of the Customs was undertaken by the Egyptian officials lent by tne Egyptian Government, but two of these have left and for far the greater part of the year Mr .Abdul Salam has been in sole charge. That at the end of a year's working the state treasury shows a over credit balance of three lakhs of rupees represents a somewhat remarkable feat, and the credit for this satisfactory result is largely due to the great energy and admirable management of the Director General* Of these facts you are however well av.are, as xix of the extreme difficulty of getting officials to serve in J. /guecat. Mr.Alaiul Salam liaB done first claes work In training local material in the more subordinate posts of the customs, but men to fill the superior posts will for some time to come have to 'be imported from oujbside. Whether these will 'be available I do not know, 'but the situation is in any case alarming as it does not seem that they will reach here before the departure of Mr .Abdul Salam on leave. Ylhen the ^suiding hand of Mr .Abdul Salam is withdrawn, especially when he will have had no opportunity to train his successor in the peculiar conditions of the place, I dare not contemplate the result, but it is safe to prophecy that a year's strenuous work and successful structure on the part of all concerned will crumble to' dust.

Sir, I hav© the honour to forward a detailed statement of th© f finances of the I us cat State during the first four months of th© financial year brining 1st October 1920 till the 31st January 1921# The rapid fall in th© exchange rate of the dollar has caused'' the revaluation of the cash balances in the State Treasury which are held partly in rupees and partly in dollars^ Th© dollar has now been coinputed at Bso2/ fc - instead of at Bs^/S/- ss formerly* The cash balance in the state treasury on the 1st Cctobtr 1920 was therefore Bs:3,25,8C{y~ at the new valuation instead of Bs.35I6C0/- 8s formerly given• The receipts, expenditure and balances during the four months under reveiw have all been calculated at the rate of Bs• 2/- to the dollar# The receipts during the four months totsl Bst4 f 38,9CC/'»' on an averggt of Bs: 1,09,725/- per mensem. Daring the same period in 1919-1920 the receipts were Bs :2,86,C90/~ on an average of Rs:71,522/- per mensem. The receipts therefore show an average monthly i ne r«a S r of E S ;38,20C/-, ®d a total tocrcaso of B S :I528CC/4 as compered to last year. When it is rcmauibcred that duiins this period in ths l^t finsuoial year' the dollar was rorlii more thtt Ss :2/8/- Ail# now it is only worth 8s:2/-, the result may be regarded as fairly satisfactory* Turing to the details of receipts the most notable end satisfactory feature is the oustoms revenue from ports other than(Pag-© 2)• than I 'u sos t trail* This total w s:69 f 945/»- as Gompsred to nil the previous year® In addition to th® EdT^ittsigQ of &amp;n incrft^sQ in rerenu© mi tbes© reooipts are a fairly rtlitble indication of the iicreased kutbority of the central administration, and angur well for tho future is Sohar and 'iwaiur the two richest of the outlying ports with the exception of Our have not yet been absorbed 'by the central customs control, though they will be iEimediately customs personnel becomes arailable. Landing;, ^usrrntine snd miscellaneous receipts total compared to nil the previous year* Customs receipts at Tuscat and T'uttrah total rfs:2,9C,S85/- as compared to *'s:2,39,5CC/- the previous year, an increase of Ss:5l,385/- only. This is admittedly disappointing but it is undoubtedly caused by the prevalent trade slump due to the filling exchange, i-erchsmts «ro ch^ry of ordering out new stocks till they hsve disposed of their old r^t the artificially high prices which were prevflent only six months «go. The totrl customs receipts from ell sdil souicgs ere there- -fore Es;3,SO,88C/-. The budeet^-Vs^o 0 aTerage a lakh e month tnS therefor# expeotntloas hmc not fcaen fulfilled. The reasons for this have however been explained shove and are due to world wide conditions of which it was not easy to calculate the effect whem tbc budget was originally framed. fixpenditure for the four months was ls;3,55,CiO/- on an average of Rs.88,75C/- per irensem as coirpared with fcs.2,56,0bC/- on an average of Bs.54,000/- per men sew the previous year. The expenditure has however included the two large item of Ks:46.740/- for tiie repayment of the loan and Es:530CC/- for the purchase of a motor cruiser and motor boat, while in the same period of last year only the usual running administrative expenditure had to be met. Excluding the two large items above mentioned the running expendi ture was almost exactly the saw as in the same four months of last year, about Es^.OOC/- per mensem. This again is satisfactory as iO\(Page 3). ss incongruous as it uiay seftm almost all salaries hay® been increased and tht salary list includes the administration of tfci© outlying ports which it did not before. The running expenditure is within the budget estimate. The four months therefor© sho^ a credit balance in the treasury of Rs:83 t 89C/-, which gives a total cash bslsnce nf ^t I jx the credit of the state of Bs:4 t C9,70C/- including the balance at the end of the last financial year, the value of the dollar being taken at Rs;2/«-«» The first instrlment of the loan has been met, as also the initial expenditure on the boats. The expenses of the levy corps have been provided for, and the state should be able to meet them, but in vie^r of the prevail ing trade depression the resources of the state will have to be very carefully husbanded. The following schedules ere attached:- 1. Schedule of payments. 2. Schedule of receipts. 3. Schedule, .tp};alg.of # E®coipts, .Pay-^ -ments snd Bala-nces.

Reference your telegram No. 168 of the 26th January about a tutor for Saiyid Said, I am afraid that I know of noone in Mesopotamia. The problem is a most difficult one. The only tiling that I can think of is thaVyou should addrRSSB Zia-ud-din, the principal of Alisarh. There are always about thirty or forty Arabic le&amp;ree atuients there, among whom will be some excellent Arabic scholars. They are of course well up in Arabic literature and grammar, but do not know the spoken language. If the Principal* could recommend a suitable man who would be willing to undertake the job the latter could interview the Sultan at Dehra Dun which is quite close, and if could considered suitable he could then come to Muscat for a couple of months or so and stay with Saiyid Baid. Duribg his stay at Muscat he would with his previous knowledge be able to pick up quite enough of the spoken language to caryy on with. is quite agreable to it. In fact such a maa mifiht be far more suitable than an Arab or an Egyptian who would be like a fieh I have iiacussel this plan with the Bultan, an! he out of water the whole time®ft n L a\L British Reei'denoy and Consulate -General, Buehire, 23rd February 1921. His Higlmess the Sultan o' T 'uscat desires to send his aon sayyid Saoed to the Mayo Chiefs College, and is anxious to send a reliable well educated man of good family, who knows litorary Arabic well and can give lessons in it, to the College with the hoy as tutor and guardian. Hj s Highness is prepared to pay a salary of Ss^SOO/- - 300/- per mensem to a suitable man, and he would presumably live with Sayyid Saeed. For some time past I have been trying to get hold of a suitahlo 'rab but failod / and it has occurred to me that per haps you may have some graduates who have taken degrees and are on the look out for employment, some of whom would probably be really good -rabio scholars and be otherwise suitable. If you can recommend a suitable man would you kindly instruct him to go to Dehra Dun and interview His Highness the Sultan who will be there next month. Then if His High ness approves of him ho could go to '.uso-t^and stay with Sayyid Saeed for two or three months. This should be quite sufficient period to enable a good Arabic scholar to become reasonably proficient at colloquial Arabic, and the new tutor could then proceed to Mayo College with his pupil. As I am going on a long tour^ and to write to mo would only delay matters, so will you kindly reply to his letter to the political Agent Muscat C'r.

Sir, I have the honour to refer to my letter No.267 date! the ICth February 1921 on the subject of the finances of the Muscat state. The world wide trade depression and the fall in the price of silver to which reference was made in the above letter have been acutely felt in Muscat during the last two months. The revenue of the state has been correspondingly affected, and the figures for the months of February and March show receipts of 118.63,190/- and Rs. ^respectively and expenditure of R8»62,970/« and Rs, l%0^. Included in the expenditure of March are payments of Rs.8000/« on account of petrol for the motor boat for more than six months and about Rs.5000/- in connection with the levy corps. I do not anticipate that trade will show much if any improvement during the months of April, may and June. During July the date season begins, but again owing to the complete lack of rain this year the date crop in Oman will certainly be a bad one, it is estimated by local opinion at not more than 75^ of last year's, and the price of dates will equally c rtainly be low. From July onwards it nevertheless may be anticipated that the income will average a lakh or more a month. For the months of March, April, May and June it is however more than probable that the income of the state will not average more than Rs.50,000/~. This is very serious, but this falling is due to causes which are world wide andwhich six months ago it was not easy to for...,. The running expenses of the state, excluding the repayment of the loan now average about R B .64.000A p.m. With the arrival H xl of the levy corps, an! with the extra expenses of providing th. personnel of the boat and of more customs officials, should no reductions be made in the present scale of monthly charges, the monthly expenditure will be abou,. Rs.80,000/-, This means that the running expenditure for the months March to June will exceed the income by about R b.1,30,000/-. In addition to this the state on the 1st June has to pay Rs.46,740/- towards the second instalment of the loan, and during these months R8 .26.500/- for the arms and equipment of the levies. In otner woris during these four months th® expenditure of the state will exceed the insome by about two lakhs of rupees. At the end of February the state had in its treasury a balance of Hs.4,10,000/-. There will therefore be sufficient funds to meet this extra expenditure. But the greatest economy is called for and I have addressed a strong letter to the Council of Ministers urging them to cut down all expenditure to the minimum possible. By the dismissal of the useless 'asker' and of certain surplus personnel at other ports it should be possible to save some Rs.SOOOyA- p.m. In view of the undoubted financial stringency I however consider that the state is called on to make other economies. The only method in which this can be done is by reducing the Sultan^ personal allowance of Ra.10,000/- p.m. Under the terms of the loan the payment of this allowance is conditional upon the ability of the state to make the payment. Should the finances of the state be momentarily embarrassed Government has the right to ask the Muscat G-overnment to reduce this personal allowance. During 1920 this step was taken upon my advice, but owing to some misunderstanding the Wazir gave to His Highness an undertaking that the amount withheld should be paid it the end of the year if it was found that the stateooull afford It. '^ T V, I have repeatedly informed toe Sultan in . .. . ou -i-tan in conversaticn 14 ^ ^ ^ personal allo.ance depend, upon whether Oovern.ent consider* that Ms B tate a . for4 It. and he perfectly underetands the aituation. X would at H0 in this connection rpii q ++ x. - ^ ention to Memoranduia No. 1766-S-A date! the ist December 1930 from fh* r 0 J i0in G-ovemment of InOia in tie ■ - an and Political Department, and to the correspondence which passed between the Sultan and the Political A^ent when I the loan was granted, I I would therefore recommend that the Sultan be informed that from the 1st May 1921 his pereonal allowance Wil1 b ^ UCea t0 RB - 5 0^/- P-*. as long as he resides in India^ to the present financial position of the state. I put up a draft letter to be sent to His Highness for your approval, In view of the necessity for despatching this letter to the Sultan before the end of April, and at the same time of informing the Council of Ministers as to the decision taken, I should be grateful of early orders. I have the honour to be Sir, your most obedient servant • C *S« Political Agent, Muscat.2- i+v PROPOSED LETTER TO THE SULTAN OP MUSCAT IN INDIA ON THE ^ SUBJECT OP THE LiUSCAT STATE FINANCES AND HIS PRIVY PURSE. After compliments. I aliress Your Highness on the subject of the finances of your state. During the last few months a period of great trade depression has come over the whole world. This is largely the result of the late war, and it is to be hoped, in fact it is sure that this stae of affairs will only be temporary. At the same time due to other causes the price of silver has fallen. In Muscat this means that the dollar can no longer purchase as much as formerly. Finally there has been no rain this year, and-this as Your Highness knows means that the Oman date crop will be bad in comparison with former years. In consequence of these advers causes merchant are nervous of trading to any great extent and in many cases have not the money to do so. This condition of affairs must affect the income and finances of Your Highness' state. Indeed the effect is already noticeable. In spite of a more efficient organisa- -ti on ^during the monthe of February the income only just balanc d the expenditure, whiJu during the month of March it exceeded the income by Rs, These are usually ' among the most profitable months of the year At the same time the state is compelled to incur heavy initial expenditure in outfitting and paying Your Highness new troops, and in other essential services. After consultation with Your Highness ministers I have calculated that during the four months from March till the end of June, if no economies are made, the exioenditure will exceed the income of the state by about two lakhs of rupees. By careful management the state treasury has a balance of about four lakhs of rupees. Ths state will therefore inshallah be able to meet successfully this period^ of financial stringency till the i4ie season begins and trade revives.

Mr. Abdul Salstm left Muscat on the 24th instant en route for Egypt. He has taken three months and'six days furlough excluding the period of the voyage preparatory to terminating his contract. The customs are now in charge of Mr.Abu Saleh, an old employee of the Muscat customs. Should the Egyptian Government second Mr.Abdul Salam for a further period of two years the Muscat Government will communicate with Mr.Abdul Salam in Egypt as to the terms of a new contract. The Muscat customs are now of course no longer under the charge of a trained customs official, as we should interpret the phrase, and it is with regret that I must reiter- -ate the pessimistic opinion as to the future expressed in my S.
