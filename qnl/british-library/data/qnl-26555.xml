Millard was visibly disturbed and at once began to explain to me that he had, on receiving Rendel’s letter on E 2481, communicated its contents by bag to Mr. Murray of the State Department for communication to the headquarters of the Standard Oil Company of California. Millard went on to speculate as to whether instructions on the I' 7 -' POL DePr ewbject/ / &lt;j.C. Walton, Esq. , C.B. , M.C® POL. DEPt. 5JUL 1934 office© subject could possilDly not have reached the Company’s local officials in the Hasa before the violation reported in E 4006 had taken place; as the Resident had not reported the date on which the violation took place, it was impossible to be certain, but it seemed unlikely that there had not been time for the instructions to be received locally. Millard also said that having regard to the position of Salwa with reference to the coast line, he could not conceive how the pilot of the aeroplane could have been mistaken as to Salwa being to the east of the blue line as described by us. Millard then asked me what we wanted done in the matter. I told him that relations between His Majesty’s Government and the Bahrein Oil Company (which, like the California Arabian Standard Oil Company, which operates in the Hasa, is a subsidiary of the Standard of California) had always been most amicable and we were anxious that relations in that part of the world with Standard of California and its subsidiaries should remain so. On the other hand, we naturally expected that the frontier would/would, not be violated, and wanted the position cleared up. I left it to him what action to take; we did not want to make an unnecessary fuss so long as the position was made clear. Millard expressed gratitude for our attitude in the matter, said that he was still extremely puzzled by what had occurred, that he would pass on the information as regards the violation of the frontier to Mr. Murray of the State Department in order that the question could be taken up with Standard of California. This seems to me satisfactory. I have not the least doubt from Millard’s attitude that he, at any rate, is not privy to any intention on the part of the Standard Oil Company of California, or the California Arabian Standard Oil Company to jump our claims as regards the blue line. He was clearly much disturbed at my communication and equally clearly relieved to find that we were not disposed to// +* /^VwvO 'k), &lt;.

The Foreign Office in their letter of 24th April to the U.S.Embassy (your No.E.2481/279/91) requested the Embassy to make sure that the Company were informed of the position regarding the Blue Line boundary, 'in order that there may be no danger of their aircraft unwittingly violating the prohibition of flying east of the boundary or of their inadvertently extending their operations in any way to the east of that line'. In view of this, if the Foreign ^ Office see no objection, we think it might be as well to draw the Embassy’s attention to this infringement of the Blue Line. •Inoftrely. 2531 (Mj J. C.

There is, 1 think, definite advantage in letting the United States Government have the text of these tv\o Conventions at once and intimating to them that we regard tne Blue Line of tne 1913 Convention as the eastern limit of Ihn Baud*s-territories. It will he remembered that the position of the Blue Line was examined in connection with tne question of the Qatar boundary. It was suggested (Foreign Office concurring) that while the fact that the 1913 Convention had not been ratified possibly made our legal position rather weak, it would be desirable on general grounds to maintain that line as the eastern boundary of Saudi Arabia. The legal position has now been further investigated by the Foreign Office Legal Advisers. As a result, I^adonottonti £yeai Mvv ^unaul (jngi they are of opinion that in view of the fact that the Blue Line of tne unratified 1913 Convention is referred to in the ratified Convention of 1914 we shall be on very strong ground legally internationally in maintaining it against Ton Saua. They have separately put forward a proposal,which is for discussion in the Middle Bast Committee next week, that we should, if this view is accepted, claim on behalf of Qatar all the area betweec the base of the Qatar Peninsula (the boundary at present claimed by tne Sheikh himself) and the Blue Line. That proposal, ii accepted, would not, however, involve any extension either of the area of the Qatar oil concession or of the guarantee of protection given by H.M.G. beyond the base of the ’Qatar Peninsula.

It appears to Sir John Simon that if His Majesty's Government were to refrain from assisting the United States Government in their present enquiry by drawing their attention to these texts, the United States Government might well obtain misleading information on the subject either from the Turkish Government or from King Ibn Baud, or might imagine that the situation in this part of Arabia is completely fluid and undefined* In this event it might well happen that the aircraft which the California Arabian Standard Oil Company are employing for their survey of the Hasa oil concession might embark on extensive survey operations in the hinterland of Qatar, possibly penetrating even as far as the coast to the south-east of Qatar, without its being realised by the United States Government or the Company that in doing so they were going beyond what His Majesty's Government regard as the limit of Ibn Saud's dominions; and this aerial reconnaissance might easily be followed by experimental operations on the part of the company in the area west of the 1913 line. It is by no means certain that His Majesty's Government would be informed of such operations in time to forestall them# 3. If on the other hand His Majesty's Government communicate to the United states Government forthwith, through .the United States Embassy in Angora, the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1914, which contains a precise definition of the frontier in this area, the United States Government will have no excuse for not warning the company of the views held by His Majesty's Government; and since there is no reason to believe that they desire another dispute with His Majesty’s Government in this area/area at present, it is possible that they 'will advise the company to keep to the west of the frontier line in question and not to challenge the claims of His Majesty’s Government hy deliberately crossing it # 4© I am to request the favour of an early reply, 5.

British Embassy, Angora. February 13, 1934. Sir, I have the honour to inform you, as a matter of possible interest, that the United iStates Embassy in Angora recently enquired whether a copy of the Anglo-Turkish treaty of the 29th July, 1913, which delimited the frontiers between Aden and the Ottoman dominions and between Muscat and the Ottoman dominions, among others, could be supplied to them from the archives of His Majesty’s Embassy. The United States Embassy have been informed that a search was made among the archives of this Embassy, but without result. 2. In making this request the secretary of the United States Embassy explained that it was the State Department at Washington which desired a copy of the treaty, end had instructed the Embassy here to apply for a copy to the Turkish Government. The secretary went on to say that he had himself thought of addressing a similar request to His Majesty’s Embassy in order to avoid delay in obtaining a copy of the treaty. 3. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Washington. I have, etc., (Sgd*) Percy Loraine. The Eight Honourable Sir John Simon, G.C.S.I., K.C.V.O., etc., etc., etc.air.

Xhie enquiry mny prove of considerable importance, since there ia reaeon to believe that the interest which it reveals on the part of the United states *oyurnment in the question of boundaries in a astern ^rabia is in all probability connected with the activities of United states oil interests in that area. As you sure no doubt aware, in July, 1933, the 8t«ndard Oil Company of California obtained from King tbn Saud an oil concession covering the eastern part of hie dominions. To the north the Halts of /thisthis oonceasion ara oo-terminoua with the frontiers between Saudi ^rabia, on the one hand an« &lt;^|iq and the independent Arab principality oi Kowelt 9 on the other. These frontiers are no* laid down in certain agreements referred to in paragraph 4 below, but the position in the south and south-east Is, however, less simple, 3, On the ?9th July, 1913, His Majesty*s Government concluded with the Ottoman Government a Convention defining the south- eastern boundary of Turkish *rabia from the coast of the Persian Gulf as far as the EOth p rail el of latitude, second Convention concluded on the 9th Uaroh, 1914, continued the definition of this boundary between this point and the already delimited frontier between the Vilayet of the Yeraon and the Aden Protectorate, Copies of the 1913 Convention are enclosed in this despatch: the text of the 1914 Convention will be found on pages 4£ end43 of tte 1933 edit Ion of Volume Al of Altohlson's 'Treution* ^n^ego^nto «nd 'Sanado”, a copy of which is, I understand, in the library of Hie Majesty 9 8 Kmbnasy* The first of these Conventions was never ratified, but the boundary line 1 »id c own in article 11 thereof was definitely adopted by article 3 of the second Convention, the ratifications of which were exchanged in Leaden on the ird June, 1914, His Majesty 9 s Government in the United Kingdom have not had ooc sion to disoues with King tbn Sand, since he acquired Independent sovereignty over Hejd and the llaea Const, the question of the precise boundary between his dominions Mid those of the ^rab rulers in the Persian Gulf, who ere in sped el treaty relations with His Majesty 9 a Government, although Ibn Saud has, by article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda of the 30th May 1937 formally recognised v those apeolal relations .md undertaken to /mai ntainmaintain friendly relations with the rulers concerned* dut tiae fact that certain territories on the Ottoman aide of the Ul«i, 14 line hare now beeo&amp;e independent States f oaimot be regarded in the riew of His Majesty 9 s Government as In any way affecting the status of the territories on the other side of that line, which were then md still roEsain urder British influence* His Majesty's Ooreratuent therefore still ragurd the 191B/14 line as forming the boundary between th© Ottoman Buooesslon State of Saudi 4r ibla ^nd the territories of south eastern Arabia with which they are in special relations* 4* Having regard to the presence of United States oil Interests In this r.rea it is important that the United States ^o\omment should be under no misapprehension on this point* It is desirable therefore /thatn that they should receive as Xull an account as possible of the position of His Majesty's Oovernmont in this matter without delay, find should not be left to obtain possibly misleading information from the Turkish or Saudi Arabian Governments* I sh#ll be glad, therefore, if you will arrange, aa ftoon as possible for the United states Embassy at Angora fa) to be furnished with a copy of The Anglo-Turklsh Convention of the 29th July, 1912, and fb) to be shown the tent of The Anglo~Turkleh Convention of the 9th Karoh, 1914 (Altohlson, volume XI (1933) pages 42 onwards)* It should be pointed out to the United States Embassy that, while the 1913 convention is unratifled, the boundary laid down in Article 11 Is mentioned, aderuately defined and definitely adopted In Article 3 of the ratified convention of 1914, which in the view of His Majesty's Government remains operative. if'urther, since Article 7 of the 1913 Convention contains provisions regarding the/the A rentier of Koweit, It would be well that the attention of the United Statee Kmbaesy N ehoul^Valeo be drawn to (c) the Khwalt-Nejd f* v* Boundary Convention of the End December, 19E£ fAitohiaon volume II (1933) pages 213-4)• ?inally, since in connexion with the California Standard Oil Company 1 e oonoeseion it may be of Interest to the United States Oovermuent to have the exact documentary definition of tnc Iraq-fc y ejd frontier, the United Statee Embassy should also be shown the text of (d) Protocol Ho* 1 between Iraq and He^d, signed at Uqair on the 2nd December, 1922. fAitohiaon voLome II (1933) pagea 211-2). 6.

We are a little doubtful whether the intention of your official letter E.3215/3215/44 of 15th April is to let the American Embassy have all the documents included in the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1914, or only those concerning the Aden boundaries. In the latter event we presume that the documents to be furnished will be the convention of 9th March, 1914, with its annexures - F.O. print [kj~ Turkey/Confidential/6625. Is this correct? Y/e should, I think, like to consult the Government of India before replying officially; and we presume that the Colonial Office also are being consulted, as being a Department directly concerned for the time being, pending a settlement of the question of responsibility for Aden political affairs.

Le GouvernementImperial ottoman s’abstiendra de toute immixtion dans les affaires de Koueit, y compris la question de la suc cession, et de tout acte d’admini- stration ainsi que de toute occupation et tout acte militaire, dans les territoires qui en font partie. En cas de vacance, le Gouvernement Imperial ottoman nommera kaimakam, par firman Imperial, le successeur du cheikh defunt. II aura aussi la faculte de nommer aupresdu cheikh un commissaire pour proteger les int^rets et les indigenes des autres parties de 1’Empire. Article 3. Le Gouvernement Imperial ottoman reconnait la validite des conventions que le cheikh de Koueit a conchies precedem- ment avec le Gouvernement de Sa Majeste britannique en date found in good and due form, have agreed as follows:— I.— Koweit. Article 1. The territory of Koweit, as delimited by articles 5 and 7 of this convention, forms an auto nomous kaza of the Ottoman Empire. Article 2. The Sheikh of Koweit shall, as heretofore, fly the Ottoman flag, with the word “ Koweit ” inscribed in the corner, if he so desire, and he shall enjoy com plete administrative autonomy in the territorial zone defined in article 5 of this convention. The Imperial Ottoman Govern ment shall abstain from any interference in the affairs of Koweit, including the question of the succession, and from any administrative act or occupation, and from any military act, in the territories forming part thereof. In the event of a vacancy, the Imperial Ottoman Government shall appoint the successor of the late Sheikh, by Imperial firman,to bekaimakam. The Imperial Ottoman Govern ment shall also be free to accredit to the Sheikh a commis sioner to protect the interests and the natives of other parts of the Empire. Article 3.

Cette ligne est marquee en vert sur la carte annexee a la presente covehtion (annexe V). Article 8. Dans le cas oil le Gouverne- ment Imperial ottoman s’enten- drait avec le Gouvernement de Sa Majeste britannique pour faire aboutir la ligne ferree de Bagdad-Basra a la mer au terminus de Koueit ou a tout a litre terminus dans le territoire autonome, les deux Gouverne- ments s'entendront sur les dis positions a prendre touchant la garde de la ligne et des stations ainsi que I'etablissement de bu reaux douaniers, depots de marchan discs et toute autre installation accessoire au service de la voie ferree. Article 9. Le cheikh de Koueit jouira en pleine securite des droits de pro- priete privee qu’il possede dans le territoire du vilayet de Basra. Ces droits de propriete privee devront s’exercer en conformity de la loi ottomane et les biens immobiliers qu’ils concernent seront soumis aux impots et cuarges, au mode de conserva tion et de transmission et a la juridiction etablis par les lois ottomanes.

This line is marked in green on the map annexed to this convention (Annex V). Article 8. In the event of the Imperial Ottoman Government agreeing with His Britannic Majesty’s Government to extend the Bagdad-Basra Railway to the sea at the terminus of Koweit, or to any other terminus in the autonomous territory, the two Governments shall come to an understanding as to the measures to be taken with respect to the guarding of the line and stations, and with regard to the establish ment of customs offices, ware houses, and any other installation accessory to the service of the railway. Article 9. The Sheikh of Koweit shall enjoy in full security the private proprietary rights which he possesses in the territory of the Basra vilayet.

Article 10. Criminals of the neighbouring provinces shall not be allowed6 dans le territoire de Koueit et serunt repousses si on les y trouve; egalement les criminels de Koueit ne seront pis re^us dans les provinces voisines et seront repousses si on les y trouve. II est entendu que cette dis position ne servira pas aux autorites ottomanes de pretexte d’immixtion dans les affaires de Koueit; elle ne servira pas non plus au cheikh de Koueit de pretexte d’immixtion dans les affaires des provinces voisines. 11.— El-Katr.

It is understood that this stipulation shall not afford a pretext to the Ottoman autho rities to interfere in the affairs of Koweit; nor, on the other hand, shall it afford a pretext to the Sheikh of Koweit to interfere in the affairs of the neighbouring provinces. II.— El-Katr. Article 11. The Ottoman sanjak of Nejd, the northern boundary of which is marked by a line of demarca tion defined in article 7 of this Convention, ends on the south at the gulf opposite the island of Zakhnuniyah, which belongs to the said sanjak. A line starting from the extreme end of the said gulf shall run due south to Ruba-al-Khali, and shall separate Nejd from the El-Katr peninsula. The boundaries of Nejd are marked by a blue line on the map annexed to this Convention (Annex V A). The Imperial Ottoman Government having renounced all their claims with regard to the El Katr peninsula, it is agreed between the two Governments that the said peninsula shall be governed, as heretofore, by Sheikh Jassim-bin-Sani and his successors. His Britannic Ma jesty’s Government declare that they will not permit the Sheikh of Bahrein to interfere in the internal affairs of El-Katr, to infringe the autonomy of the country, or to annex it.7 Article 12.

I recognise as valid and in force all former treaties and con ventions agreed to between the chiefs of Bahrein and the British Government, either direct or through the mediation of its repre sentatives in this Gulf. Article 2. I agree to abstain from all maritime aggressions of every description, from the prosecution of war, piracy, and slavery by sea, so long as I receive the support of the British Government [81] Dn the maintenance of the security of my own possessions against similar aggressions directed agaiust them by the chieis and tribes of this Gulf. Article 3.

And the British Resident engages that he will forthwith take the necessary steps for obtaining reparation for every injury proved to have been inflicted, or in course of infliction, by sea, upon Bahrein or upon its dependencies in this Gulf. In like manner, I, Sheikh Mahomed- bin-Khuleefa, will afford full redress for all maritime offences, which in justice can be charged against my subjects or myself, as the Ruler of Bahrein. Article 4.

It concerns British policy regarding what is referred to as the 'blue line' (the frontier which marked the Ottoman Government's renunciation of its claims to Bahrain and Qatar, as laid down in the non-ratified Anglo-Ottoman Convention of 1913 and redefined and adopted in the Anglo-Ottoman Convention of the following year).Much of the correspondence relates to a request for a copy of the 1913 Anglo-Ottoman Convention, which was submitted by the United States Embassy in Angora [Ankara] to its British counterpart (reportedly on behalf of the United States' State Department), as well as to the wider significance of this request in relation to the United States' oil interests in the region.The correspondence also discusses Foreign Office concerns that aerial survey work carried out by the California Arabian Standard Oil Company (Casoc) in relation to its Hasa oil concession might extend beyond the blue line (subsequent correspondence relays reports of Casoc's aeroplane having crossed the blue line).Although the date range of the file is 1913-1934 most of the material dates from 1934. In addition to correspondence from 1934, the file includes two letters between officials of the Foreign Office and the India Office dating from 1924, and printed copies of the Anglo-Ottoman Conventions of 1913 and 1914 (in English and French), both of which contain enclosed maps (with text in English and Arabic). Also included with the Conventions are printed copies of agreements and treaties between Britain and various Gulf rulers, covering 1820-1904, and printed copies of Anglo-Ottoman protocols, covering 1903-1905.Notable correspondents include the following: the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (Lieutenant-Colonel Trenchard Craven William Fowle); the British Ambassador in Angora (Percy Loraine); Hugh Millard, United States Embassy, London; officials of the Foreign Office and the India Office.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence (folio 2).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to the Republic of Turkey</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Embassy to the United Kingdom, London</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Arabian American Oil Company</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Qatar</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Saudi Arabia</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Frontiers</topic></subject><subject><topic>Boundaries</topic></subject><subject><topic>Concessions</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x00029d#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
