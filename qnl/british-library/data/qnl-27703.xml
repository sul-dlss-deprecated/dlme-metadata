(b) Kbalid visited me on IGtH December and I had a moat interesting talk with him, during which he said thnt he had only decided to go back, »fter four letters hod passed between Bin ^aud and himself and only after the last had given written oath and the Royal assurance that (a'' the past was dead and buried (dumdum), (b) that he, Khalid himself, was forgiven for everything that had happened, and (c) that anyone coming with him would be safe, and be allowed to return to the tribe. On my enquiring whether he felt absolutely confident / in hi a heart that he would be safe, once he was in the King's hands, Shaikh Khalid replied in the affirmative, but added that he would never be allowed to come up to Kuwait again and would be always under^surveillance. On my remarking that to return under those conditions did not seem quite wise, Khslid replied in the rather fine words, 'T'were better to be a slave among my own people in my own tribal country, than to be a free man in exile 0 . After taking leave of me, Khalid set out for Nejd with 80 followers. I was not a little touched at the man’s pluck and trust in Bin Saud’s word, teay he reap the reward of his bravery !V Im.

The correspondence documents the efforts of the British authorities – at the Saudi Government's request – to monitor Khalid ibn Hithlain's movements and prevent him from using either Kuwait or Bahrain as a base from which to plan hostile actions. The file concludes with extracts from the Kuwait Political Agency's intelligence summaries, which report Khalid ibn Hithlain's return to Saudi Arabia in January 1935, following a general political amnesty granted by the Saudi Government.Notable correspondents include the following: His Majesty's Chargé d’Affaires to Jedda (Albert Spencer Calvert); His Majesty's Minister at Jedda (Sir Andrew Ryan); the Secretary of State for the Colonies (Philip Cunliffe-Lister); the Saudi Minister for Foreign Affairs [Fayṣal bin ‘Abd al-‘Azīz Āl Sa‘ūd]; the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year.
