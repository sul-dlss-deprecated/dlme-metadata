The original building was constructed in the fifteenth century but heavily reconstructed at some point in the nineteenth century, perhaps after this sketch was made. The artist indicates the connection with al-‘Aydarus in the inscription in pencil which reads ‘Sheik Hydroos [Aydroos]’Several figures are sketched in at the entrance to the mosque; a flagstaff appears immediately outside it. Behind the building the faint lines of a step rocky outcrop have been indicated.The sketch is signed lower right with the initials of the artist.Inscriptions:Recto, in pencil, along lower edge: ‘Sheikh Hydroos’Recto, in pen, along lower edge: ‘A Mussulman Temple – Aden. SBH.’Verso, in pencil, along upper edge and lefthand edge: ‘WD3476’; ‘Plan of Aden No. 2’Temporal Context:This sketch was probably made between January 1939, when Stafford Bettesworth Haines seized Aden, and 1854, when he was recalled to Bombay to face embezzlement and fraud charges, during which time Haines administered Aden.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="personal"><namePart>Stafford Bettesworth Haines</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">artist</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Aden</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Mosques</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023332050.0x000001#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
