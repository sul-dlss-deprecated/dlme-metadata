Nev; Delhi, the 13th November 1944. ■ To The Hon f ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. British Consulate-General, Bushire. Through External Affairs Department Sir, Sub.lect; Producticn of Dehydrated Smoked and Pre-cooked Minced Fish for the Defence Services. I have the honour to state that in order to meet the large requirements of the Defence Services, the Government of India have decided to establish two Fish Dehydration Factories with a capacity of 2 tons each per day at selected places along the Indian Coast • 2. These factories will be supplied with fresh fish from deep sea waters and a fairly large fleet of fishing vessels will be required for the purpose. The estimated requirements for each factory are as follows (1) One large country craft converted as a 'Depot' ship and fitted with a marine engine of 120 H.P. and fish storage tanks. (2) Six motor fishing vessels of the 46 1 M.F.V. (HARD CHINE) type fitted with a deisel engine of up to 120 H.P. (3) About 30 country craft ('Bedis' and 'Howras')• 3. The success of the proposed scheme depends, at present, almost entirely on whether or not we can procure suitable vessels and marine engines. This problem is being actively investigated not only in India but in Australia, America and the U.K. 4. It has also been suggested that the possibility of obtaining the required fishing vessels from the Persian Gulf area may be investigated and that you may be approached with that end in vl^w. j t* J: • (6 - 2 - 6. I am, therefore, to request that you may kindly make necessary Investigations on the subject and forward detailed information to this Department on the following linesi- (1) Whether any fishing vessels can be procured from the Persian Gulf area and, if so, to what specifications. (2) An indication of the procedure to be followed by this Department for the procurement of the vessels, if any available, and the authorities on whom our demands should be placed. (3) In how much time approximately the vessels can be made available in India, 6, I am to request that this problem may be treated as urgent and a reply sent to this Department as early as possible.

Each factory along the Indian Coast would require 'one large country craft' fitted with fish storage tanks, six motor fishing vessels and thirty country craft (Bedis and Howras). The Government of India enquired to the Political Resident Persian Gulf on the availability of vessels. Officials in Sharjah and Bahrain replied that there were no fishing vessels available as they were in short supply in the region.Correspondents include K L Panjabi, Government of India, Department of Food; Political Resident Persian Gulf; Political Agent, Bahrain; Political Officer, Sharjah; Charles Dalrymple Belgrave, Adviser, Bahrain Government.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Fishing vessels</topic></subject><subject><topic>Fishery products</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0002d0#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
