Sir, I have the honour to submit for your information the following letter which we have received from our Regional Traffic Superintendent, Karachi 1. The Postmaster General, TJ.K., has announced that the Government Departments concerned with the welfare of British prisoners of war and internees in enemy hands have regretfully decided that the ban on the sending to them of Christmas and New Tear greetings cards and calendars, which was instituted last year, must be renewed this year. 2* The reason is that experience shows that if greetings cards and calendars are s ent congestion is caused in the enemy censorship, resulting in delay to ordinary letters over the Christmas period. The decision is, therefore, in the interests of the prisoners of war themselves, some of whom after last year’s ban wrote appreciatively of the improvement in the letter service at Christmas time, resulting from the ban, as compared with previous years. 3. Relatives will appreciate forthe same reason the importance of not sending additional letters in place of greetings cards. Christmas letters to Prisoners of War Ban on greetings cards and calendars I have the honour to be.

Messrs. Rahmatullah and Shiv Dayal (postal clerks) were interrogated and both gave the same statement. During the course of investigation it was found necessary to interrogate the person who received the packet from the Post Office and took it to the steaiie r, Mr. Moti the clerk of Messrs. Gray, Mackanzie &amp; Go., Bahrain, who is entrusted with this particular job stated that he too received the packet in good condition from the Post Office and delivered to the steamer authorities in the same condition. In addition to these enquiries the police made further investigation in Manama to trace the mis sing fountain pens, but nothing was found. In view of the above facts it would appear that the incident did not taico place at Bahrain for the reason that had the packet not been in good condition the steamer authorities would not have accepted it.”.

Steam ship Bag missing S.S. r, 3arjora 1 *, I have to report that at 6.30 p.m. on Sunday 17th, February 1946, the S.S# ,f Barjora T? arrived at Bahrein from India. On board the ship were 274 Hail Bags, comprising of 118 Bags from Bombay and 156 from Karachi. These bags together with other mails were kept in the Hail Locker which is at the stern of the ship. The mail locked was opened at Bombay and again at Karachi, but not opened again until she arrived at Bahrain. At Bahrain Hatch Ho.3 was opened and parf^pf the Cargo unloaded into dhow^s. Access was then gained^uo the main locker through the wing doors in the Ho.3 Hatch. The Bah rain mail was then brought through these wing doors into No.3 Hatch on to the top of the remaining cargo and then unloaded in sling, by means of the winch into dhowjls at the-.' e-irght of the ship. The bags were checked away by the second Officer of the ship and G.LHs Nail Clerk. At Basrah when the ship was being cleared, an empty bag and the outer wrapping of a registered parcel addressed to Jassim bin Mohamed Kanoo, Bahrain, was found in Hatch No.3. During the investigation the Police visited the said ship and saw the second Officer who is responsible for the mails. He showed the Police copies of weight-bills for a total of 274 bags of mails for Bahrain on the previous jour ney, and a copy of receipt for 274 mails bags, signed by the mail clerk of G.M. &amp; Co. However, from the correspondence attached it will be seen that actually 275 bags were received excluding the missing bag. The second Officer stated that he had taken possession of the missing bag and the wrapping, which were found at Basrah and had kept them in his cabin until he received fur ther instructions. The bag and the outer cover were examined by the Police and shown to the Post Master, Bahrain, and returned to the second Officer. It is not possible to say where the contents of the mail bag were stolen, but it does appear that it was done during the time of unloading at Bahrain, i.e. between being checked out of the mail locker and unloading into the dhows. Investigation was made at Bahrein (Manama &amp; Moharraq) to ascertain if the contents of the missing parcel i.e. Gold Thread was in the market, but nothing was found. There is every possibility of the same being disposed of on board the ship. In order to avoid further re-occurrence of such type of incidents, it is suggested that the mail Bags should be handed over according to the mail list - i.e. Registered Bags, letter Bags, parcel Bags, etc., and not as one consignment of so many of different nature. This will enable better checking.i - 2 Further the attention of the proper authorities should be drawn to the fact that there was a discrepancy in the mail list and the actual number of bags which were handed over to the ship at Bombay or Karachi L Bahrain. v /'/o y—//- Adviaerate, May 8, 1946.

CORRESPONDENCE File 009. Dear Sir, The airmail service to and from South Africa seems to have deteriorated somewhat of recent months, and is inconveniencing both the Company and its employees and complaints from the latter are numerous. Not only are letters taking an extraordinary long time in transit, but some never arrive at all. As an example, I attach an envelope addressed to one of our employees which was stamped for airmail and posted on the 4th May, 1946*, it arrived in Bahrein on the 9th July, 1946. This is, of course, a particularly bad case. The average time taken from Capetown to Bahrein runs about sixteen days at the present time. The Company is not sure where the responsibility for the airmail service between South Africa and the Middle East lies. Perhaps you could be so kind as to suggest to whom we might wn e in an effort to bring about an improvement. I enclose for your information a copy of the Company’s letter to its South African Associates dated May 30th last regarding mail losses. Yours very truly, R. M.

The result of the investigation made by the Bahrain State Police is given below*- The registered parcel in question arrived at Bahrain on 8-1-1946, in sound condition, and remained in deposit in the Bahrain Post-office under the supervision of the Fegi tration Clerk Mr. Rahmatullah who was responsible for its safe custody till 10-1-1946, on which date he handed over the charge of the branch to Mr. Shivdayal. The parcel remained under custody of Mr. Shivdayal till it was despatched by hiS to Muscat on 17-1-1946. This shows that the parcel in question arrived at Bahrain Post-office in good condition, as if it had been received in defective condition tms f would have been reported to the Postmaster by Mr. Rahmatullah. Investigations were carried out to find out whether the parcel in question was tampered with by thepersonsthrough whose h^ds the parcel passed during its stay at the Bahrain Post-office. Before the despatch of the parcel to Mu c * it is possible to suppose that some one might have opened the pareeland taken out the missing fountain pens, and resealed it but there is ^sufficient evidence to substantiate a charee against any member of the Bahrain Post-office. The case if a complicated one and under the present circumstances it is not possible to find out whether the theft took place whiif the parcel in question was in Bahrain Post-office or while in transit to Muscat. 3. In view of this I am of the opinion that it is point- less to go any further into the case. 4 A Captain, for Political Agent, Bahrain. &amp; c.HO.PA/C//T H.B.M's Political A^ent, B« l:ira in* Men ar and mi : THE CUSTOMHOUSE: BAHRAIN: 19th December, 194-6 e , r I an sending herewith a number af letters f©und in the suit case af a passenger named Ahmed bin Yausuf baund far Bushire.

Memorandum:- The otate Police are investigating a case which concerns the Post Office therefore I thinic it may be of interest to you to know some of the facts which have come to light. Several Bahrain merchants complained to me on Thursday 16th that their registered letters to firms in America containing dollar notes and cheques had not reached their destination. Amounts involved were over 3,500 dollars. I was informed that the merchants had complained to the Postmaster who stated that the matter was under investigation. The merchants stated that the letters were properly manifested in Bahrain Post Office, sealed, and put into the post bag but they asserted that the post bag was sealed up not by the Postmaster but by a youth by name of Safar bin Hasan, a Bahrain subject employed as a postman. Action was taken by the Police. I myself searched Safar’s house and in it was found Rs.4,000/- in rupee notes and newly bought luxury goods, gold ornaments, carpets etc. valued at about ks.3,000/-. H. B. M’s Politics Bahrain. ? 5 OCT i347 T)3/- 2 - His pay was Ha, 85/- but has lately been reduced to hs.55/- per month. He worked in the Post Office or about seven years. He stated that he had acquired the money and goods out of his savings. In a locked box in the house there was found a letter from Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie addressed to a firm in U.S.A. dated 21st and 24th of August 1947. The envelope was unopened. A quantity of unused U.S.A. stamps were found and a piece of a heavy envelopa-with Rs.9/- worth of unstamped Bahrain stamps, also some letters, in Persian, from people in Bahrain to relations in Bombay. In possession of 3afar, when he was arrested in his house, was a mail bag containing inward letters, some of them registered. He stated that it was his habit to take the mail bags to his house as he was responsible for delivering mails. Further investigation has revealed the fact that on 28th August 1947 Safar changed 360 dollars into rupee currency. The transaction was done by a Jewish money changer. Registered letters dated 26th August and 28th August, containing together over 400 dollars sent by local merchants to U.S.A. were among those which failed to arrive in America.

Memo rand uni: memorandum No.2467-16/9A case, In continuation of my dated 21st October 1947, regarding the Post Office in the Bahrain £o\xrt on Monday last, 10th November, of 1366 Adviser to , Bahrain Dated, 29th Dulhaj, 1366 November 12, Safar bin Hasan was found guilty of stealing dollars from registered letters and sentenced to two years hard labour. 2. It was proved in Court that Safar was in possession of about Rs.6,000/- in cash and goods for which he was unable to account for satisfactorily, he admitted having bought goods valued at Ks.2,000/- during the last three months. His pay was about 85/- rupees per month. It was also proved that on one occasion he had changed 360 American dollar notes for rupees and from the evidence it appeared that he had every opportunity in the course of his duties to remove letters from the registered mail bag, the Postmaster admitted that it was his practice to hand over the open mail bag to Safar, after having weighed and listed the contents, and that Safar was then supposed to seal the bag. No satisfactory explanation was given by Safar to show why he was in possession of various letters which should not have been found in his house though he asserted that for six or seven years he had been in the habit of taking mail bags, containing outward and inward letters, to his house. *3. The Court is now considering the question of the disposal of the money found in the house which has been taken over by the Court. It is probable that this money will be refunded proportionately to those persons who prove to the Court that their letters disappeared over the period during which the thefts took place. 4. The investigations have disclosed a very unsatisfactory state of things in the Post Office administration. It is highly undesirable that it should be possible for registered or other letters to be taken by local postal employees to their houses. In all cases the letters that disappeared, or were found in the house, were rather bulky packets which appeared likely to contain notes. It is probable that other letters have disappeared whose non-arrival is not yet known. I, personally, sent a letter containing five typed pages, from Bahrain to Beirut which failed to reach its destination and a report on one of the Government departments covering several pages, also failed to reach me in 3ngland. 5. The Police are of the opinion that more than one person was concerned in this matter, not necessarily a post office employee. Although they have some reason to suspect a local Persian, who is a Bahrain subject, and who travels constantly between Bahrain and Persia they have as yet no grounds for dealing with this possible accomplice.

The 18th November, 1947. r j The Secretary to the Hor^ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bahrain^ Memorandum Recently, acting upon complaints from the public that certain registered letters containing dollar notes and cheques valuec at over £ 3500, posted at the Bahrain Post office and entered in their schedule of registered letters had not been received by tnK General Post office in London^ fche Bahrain Police made investiga tions which revealed that these registered articles had been stolen by Safar bin Hassan, a Bahrain subject,employed as a Post ian. A case was accordingly registered against him and he was sent for trial. It has been Droved in the Court that Safar, whose pay was only Rs.85/- per montl^was in possession of nearly Rs.6000/- in cash and goods for which he was unable to account satisfacton y. Several registered letters were also found in his house. Prom the evidence it appeared that Safar had every opportunity in the course of his duties to remove letters from the registered mail bag, as the practice seemed to be for the Postmaster to hand over the open mail bag to him, after having weighed and listed the contents, and for Safar to seal the bag afterwards. The Court found Safar guilty and sentenced him on the 10th November, 1947, to two years hard labour. • The Director of Posts^nd Telegraphs, Sind and Baluchis tan Circle, has been asked to have a departmental enquiry held.

Dear Sir, I have received your memo of the 15th instant and in reply have to say that the money in question was accepted by the Bahrain P.C. before the devaluation of the Pound sterling at its equivalent exchange rate and as such should have been delivered to the payee at its the then value, within a reasonable length of time. However, if any dispute was encountered later, I should have been informed of the facts immediately but I am at a loss to understand the failure of Postal authorities for keeping me ignorant until such time I initiated the matter myself. Further, para 2 of your memo under reply has 'not at all been understood by me. Do you mean that the Governments concerned have still not been able to arrive at an understanding as to the acceptability or otherwise of the remittances received by them prior to the devaluation of the Pound sterling and, as apparent from your memo,!will have to hang on for an indefinite period? If so, I regret very much, I cannot. You may realize that matters of payments are of first priority and my repre sentation to this effect, at this juncture, is not premature. ^ay in view of the above know whether I can withdraw the amount under dispute and if I can, may I further request you to let me know the place, time and date I should call at to collect the same? On the contrary I may please be informed as to how long further the payment would remain withheld. I may point out here for your information again that since the money was accepted from me at 100 to 100 exchange rate I will not, therefore, accept the payment at the devalued rate, either to the payee or to iqyself. An early reply would be very much appreciated. Thanking you. Yours truly Copy toi The Political Agent, The Government of Bahrain, for information in continua tion of my letter dated January 11, 1950. A copy of the memo received by me in reply to my letter referred to above is also attached. Para 2, of the Postal Superintendent’s letter (copy attached) allow me to say, is ridiculous and leaves much to be explained. I need not reiterate the necessity which comoelled me to write you on the subject. A period of four months has already elapsed since the amount was remitted by me and as would be seen from the attached copy of the Superintendent’s memo one cannot anticipate any settlement in the near furure. Will you, therefore, please expedite all possible and oblige. Thanking you in anticipation.(Copy) The Postal Superintendent,Bahrain. 15 th January 1950. P. 0.

He informed us that he has attended the Court several times, but so far, there has not even been a hearing of the case, and, as a result of all of the accused having been released on bail, in his opinion, the case would probably take another one or two years to be settled. He also advised us that the funds in question would not normally be released until the case was settled, but we have instructed him to endeavour to have the Court pass an order, releasing the funds to us immediately. Should our solicitor not be successful, we will then have the matter taken up with the Ministries concerned. Contd. ■THE BRITISH BANK OF IRAN AND THE MIDDLE EAST, BAHRAIN.

From dub-3ection (a) to 3ec.4(l) of the Indian Post Office Act, 1898, I have found that a private friend in his way, journey or travel can take letters with him to deliver to the person to whom they are directed, so the passenger, mentioned in the p.u.c., can be considered as a friend of the sender Abul Kasim Faizi. I do not understand Persian, so to ensure that they contain nothing political or harmful to peace in Bahrain, I suggest I.A. to check them please. J S 2.
