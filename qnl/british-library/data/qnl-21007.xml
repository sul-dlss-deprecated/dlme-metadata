It willhe seen that the American representatives are at present not prepared to accept, without qualification, any of the conditions proposed 'by His Majesty's G-overnment. It 'became clear in the course of the discussion.,that the objection felt by the American group to His Majesty*s Government centred upon the fourth condition relating to the appointment of a British subject as the Company's local Manager in Bahrein, As will be seen from the record of the discussion, an alternative version of this condition was tentatively suggested by the Colonial Office representatives, and the representatives of the Syndicate undertook; to ascertain the views thereon of their American associates, at the sa; e time making it clear that the revised version would not necessarily be considered acceptable by His Majesty's Government.

Since the second Meeting with the representat- -ive of the Syndicate was held, l r r. J anson of the Syndicate has informed an officer of the Colonial Office by telephone that as a result of a preliminary discussion with Major Davis he thought it most unlikely that the American group would be prepared to agree that Major Holmes should be designated 'Local General Manager* of the Company, but ti at he thought it probable, that they would accept some such title as 'Director' the terra 'General Manager' being reserved for the official in charge of the technical operations. He thought that the remainder of the fourth condition in its revised form would probable be acceptable to the American group, ' i—WW 'i'1 \{ [ rtovv ) , 'but the latter might wish to insert some provision making it clear that T'ajor Holmes would have r\o authority to intervene in the teohnical operations of the Company. Lord Passfield would he glad to learn whether Oominander Wedgwood Ben attaches importance to the precise designation to he given to the British official of the Company who will be responsible f r conducting negotiation with the Sheikh of Bahrein and the local population, or whether so long as it is made clear that that official only ma^ have access to the Sheikh and is the resporsihle represent- tive of the Company for the purpose of all dealings with the Sheikh and his people, tjjie question r of his title may, in Commander Wedgwood Benn's opinion, 'be regarded as a matter of comparative indifference. 5.

This letter was on the point of 'being despatched to the Syndicate when Mr. Jans or telephoned to ask that the despatch of the letter tShould tie postponed pending a further discussion. It was in accordance with this request that the present Meeting had ■been called. Mr. Janso n explained that since the Keeting of the 19th July he and Major Solmes had had an opportunity to discuss with Major Davis, the representative or tcie American group holding the option on the Syndicate's Concession, the conditions which His I£ajesty* s Government wished to ijipose as disclosed at that Meeting. Ea had ascertained from Major Davis that his principals took the following view in regard to the four proposed conditions:- (a) They x^ere not prepared to agree to the registration in Great Britain of the Company formed to operate the Concession. They had already formed a Company for that purpose in Canada which, as 'being within easy reach of their headquarters in tue United States, could he controlled therefrom. They contemplated that the Directorships of the new Company should, for the most part, he filled hy the ax)pointme.nt of Directors of their own group, who., for the purpose of Board Meetings, could^without undue inconvenience, travel to Canada. They had no organisation in this country which would enable them to operate a Companyild involve sa (Company) in London, To do so, 'therefore, would the setting up of a speoial organisation for the purpose. Another objection was that the taxation of Companies registered in this oountry was extremely heavy, much WvYlA-^) so than in Canada. ('b) They were not prepared to agree that the Chairman and Managing Director of the new Company should at all tiines he a British subject. It was their intention ttiat thcfe Chairman of the group in America should also officiate as Chairman of the new Company, and that the Managing Director (if any)should also he one of the Directors or Officials already associated with the American group. (o) Of the five Directors contemplated, they were only prepared to agree that one should 'be a British subject. As they were providing the whole capital for the enterprise, they considered it essential that full control should rest in the hands of their group, (d) They were not prepared to agree that the local Manager in charge of the Company * s operations in Bahrein should at all times he a British subject, although they were ¥/illing to appoint a British subject to act as Liaison Officer and to be employed for all negotiations with the Sheikh of Bahrein and with the local population. He would, however, be subject to the authority of the local Manager who would be a technical official in charge of the Field operations of the Company. it would be entirely opposed to their Qrganisation to appoint a non-technical Manager. S jr John Shuckburgh pointed out that in their counter Proposals the American group in effect rejected all the conditions proposed by His Majesty's Government excexjt to the extent of the admission of one British Director the Board of the Company.

It was their intention tliat thS Chairman of the group in America should also officiate as Chairman of the new Company, and that the Managing Director (if any)should also he one of the Directors or Officials already associated with the American group. (c) Of the five Directors contemplated, they were only prepared to agree that one should 'be a British subject. As they were providing the whole capital for the enterprise, they considered it essential that full control should rest in the hands of their group. (d) They were not prepared to agree that the local Manager in charge of the Company's operations in Bahrein should at all times he a British subject, although they were willing to appoint a British subject to act as Liaison Officer and to be employed for all negotiations with the Sheikh of Bahrein and with the local population. He would, however, be subject to the authority of the local Manager who would be a technical official in charge of the Field operations of the Company. it would be entirely opposed to their organisation to appoint a non-technical Manager. Sir John Shuckburgh pointed out that in their counter proposals the American group in effect rejected all the conditions proposed by His Majesty's Government except to the extent of the admission of one British Director to the Board of the Company. He felt some doubt whether the Syndicate's American associates fully a Ppreciated the position. Without His Majesty's ^■OYerniaent♦ s good will and support they could not Q btaln or work this Concession at all. As the price of(of) tliat ' sooa Wlll » 1113 Majesty's GoverMentr^ad laid ^ aof 1 certain entirely reasonable conditions» These, he was satisfied, represented, the fflinimutn requirements of His Majesty s government» The fourth condition} that in regara to tne Appointment of a British local Manager, was as much in the interest of the Company as of His haj esty s Gt-overniaent, although the latter attached the greatest possible importance to this condition, possibly the American group did not realise that had it not 'been for the services rendered 'by Great Britain in the Persian Gulf during the last hundred years, there could have Deen no question to-day of working an oil Cone es a ion in tuose areas. This country, 'by sacrifice of men and money, had made the Gulf safe for enterprises l Qf character, and they had every right to impose [such conditions on the conduct of commercial enterprises |in tuQse regions as they considered necessary in the | prtkerance of their policy of pacification and the promotion of prosperity in the Gulf States. .said that all this had 'been explained to the Americanjgroup on more than one occasion, hut that ^ey apioarently felt that as they were providing all the capital they should 'call the tune'. ! ^-^2^n_S huckhur^h asked to which of the four conditions |the Americans attached the greatest importance. ^i^anson replied that undouhtedly his American associates attached the greatest importance to conditien (d). He bought it possible that if this could he settled to the Sa tisj.action of hoth parties the remaining three conditions 0ll l&lt;i oe disposed of with less difficulty. The Americans SParently had a very low opinion of the managerial c Dil ities of British subjects.

In the light of the views expressed hy the Indian authority concerned, Mr Secretary Benn concurs generally, sulDjact to the verbal modification referred to in . paragraph 3 helow, in the draft letter proposed to he addressed to the Syndicate. The Secretary of State desires, however, to invite particular attention to the Viceroy's suggestion that it is desirahle that the Shaikh of Bahrein should himself insist on transactions with the Company passing through the Political Agent | 0 nly. It will he seen that Colonel Barrett does not anticipate difficulty in arranging for this. The further suggestion made hy the Government of India as to the insertion of a proviso that in the case of war or The Under Secretary of State Colonial Office.-2- r other emergency His Majesty's Government would have a right of pre-emption on the Company*s oil is one which fould appear also to merit consideration. On a minor point referred to in Colonel Barrett's telegram of the 19th august, the Secretary of State agrees with the Political Resident that it is desirable to have in view, if possible, a suitable British understudy who might, if necessary, succeed Major Holmes as Chief Local . jeoresentative in Bahrein* 5. as regards the terms of the draft letter, Mr Benn, in the light of the arguments employed in Foreign Office letter of 16th August, No. E. 4059/E81/91, to the Colonial Office, does not press for the retention of the reference in paragraph 2 to which exception is therein taken.

I do not think that Shaikh Hamed himself cares anything about nationality of the company. Until now he has been under the Lpression that the company is an English one because fejor Holmes ii an Knglishman. What interests the Shaikh, and all his relations, is the prospect of possibly finding oil. increasing the revenues and so making it possible to increase their allowances. Shaikh Hamed is very interested in the idea that perhaps some day the air route will pass through Bahrain. It is thought locally that Ms is going to happen. I am sure i.e will he glad to insist on the aerodrome and flying boat harbour being kept free for the planes, is regards official business passing tnrough the i-olitical A^ent o.-aik Earned would naturally be very glad that it should ao so. When you wish Shaikh Hamed to make these suggestions I leel | sure that he will be glad to do so.

WilUama 'jlote of Conference with Eastern and G-eneral Syndicate, Btti August 19S9, As arranged on the 31st of July, a further meeting was held at the Oolonial Office on Thursdaythe 3th August •between Mr Janson and Major Holmes, of the Eastern and General Syndicate, and Sir John Shuckhurgh. Mr. Williams, Mr» Hall, and Mr, Bigg were also present. Mr. Janson handed to Sir John Shuckhurgh a summary, which had heen received from New York hy telegram, of the comments made 'by the American group upon the proposals put forward on hehilf of His Majesty»s Government at the meetin held oji th® 19th and 31st of July. This summary, which was practically indsntical with the views expressed by Mr. Janson on the 31st of July, read as follows;- ( a ) A Canadian Company is essential on account of taxation and easy location for Managing Director to attend Board Meetings. (b) The Managing Director and/or Chairman cannot he British, as Americans are providing all tke capital and the Gulf oil Company have no Foreign representatives on a fty of their Boards. ^ c ) The Americans agree one Director to he British out of five, he may onl y hold his qualification shares. The Americans agree that a person Satisfactory the British Government would be employed with title of Special Delegate Special Agent Foreign Representative or Special Hepresentative. company, who would directly handle with the Sheikhs consultation with the British Political Agent all 111 -rs of business nature necessary to he taken up with the■ I the SUeiiclis and also all matters of Political or Diplomatic nature to 'be taken up with the Sheikhs. In all such 'business matters such .....would 'be guided 'by advice and suggestions of Local Manager of the Qompany, hut as respect all Political or Diplomatic matters involving policy such would he guided Ijy advice and suggestions of the Home Office of the Parent owing Company. (e) The Americans agree that as ma^r British shall be employed in the Company as consistent with the efficient working of the property. Sir John Shuckhurgh again warned the representatives of the Syndicate that no modification: of the conditions communicated to them on the 19 th of July could he agreed to without consultation with the other interested Departments of Hia&gt; MaJ esty•s Government, and that any modification tentatively agreed upon in the course of the present conversations would have to be referred to those Departments for concurence. In Sir John Shuckhurgh's view, condition (d) was the most important condition, both from the point of view of the American group and from that of His Majesty's Government, and this condition was therefore discussed in the first instance. Mr. Janson explained that the American group had not felt able to accept in its entirety the variant of this condition proposed at the Meeting of the Sls^of July. They had expressed their readiness to agree to ^he appointment of Major Holmes as their local representative in Bahrein for the purpose of conducting business with the Sheikh of Bahrein, in consultation with the Political Agent, but they were not prepared ^ confer upon him the title of Local General Manager or Manager, or to allow him to control in any way the technical operations of the Company in Bahrein; nor were y^at this stage to conclude a contract with Major 'olmes far a period of five years, as, until they had^ coBm® nce&lt; ^ operations in Batirein and had ascertained that oi 1 waS ^ oun ^ 'there in commercially payable quantities, they were not in a position to say wliether tueir operations in Bahrein would extend over s® long a period five years. Sir John Shuckburgh stated that he appreciated why the American group were unwilling at this stage to give Major Holmes a definite appointment for a period of five years, 'but that, while the position might be reasonable in so far as related to Major Holmes, it could not be said to he satisfactory from the point of view of His Majesty's G-overmaent. In his view it was essential to make it clear that Major Holmes, or whoever else was appointed with the approval of His Majesty's Government &amp;s the Local represen&amp;ative of the Company for the purpose of their relations with the local authorities in Bahrein, was the chief representative of the Oompany in Bahrein, and was the only representative of the Oompany who was empowered to deal with those authorities. It was also essential that his appointment should he for a definite periodjof five years in the first instance,or for such lesser period as the Company minght continue to conduct its operations in Bahrein. If the Oompany discontinued operations, the need for the appointment otYiously ceased; but it was necessary to provide against ^ different contingency, vizt:~ that the Oompany might, at an early stage in the proceedings, and without any question arising of a discontinuance of operations, remove the representaiive approved hy His Majesty*s Government and invite our concurrence in the appointment a successor ahout whose suitability it might he difficult for us to satisfy ourselves.. It was^much in interests of the Oompany as of His Majesty's Government that the Chief local representative of the Coiripany should he persona grat a with His Majesty's Go Yerimient, and also with the local authorities in Bahreinle Delieved that five years'experience would suffice fully to convince the Company of this, and to satisfy tJieffl that it was desirable, in their own interests, to to employ a suitable British subject as their cUief local representative in Bahrein. Sir John Shuckhurgh did not think that there was any need for the chief local representative of the Oompany to control their technical operations in Bahrein,' the question of his relations with the official in charge of the technical operations was entirely a matter for the Oompany, which need not 'be mentioned in the conditions governing the assignment of the Ooncession. After some discussion it was agreed that condition (d) might 'be redrafted to make it clear that Major Holmes should 'be appointed as the chief local representative of the Gompany in Bahrein, and that the Company should be under an obligation to His Majesty's Government to employ him in that capacity for a period of five years in the first instance, or for such lesser period as the Company were operating in Bahrein, and that he should 'be the only official of the Oompany who was empowered to deal with the local authorities and population in Bahrein.. It was also agreed that the Colonial Office should furnish the Syndicate with a reasoned explanation of the oiroumstances which rendered it essential to impose this oondition. As regards the remaining conditions, it was agreed that in all^circumstances, the contention of the American group that they should not 'be required to register a ^resh Oompany in this country might he regarded as r easonable; and it was suggested as an alternative that, if His Majesty 's G-overnment agreed that the Company formed take over the concession should remain registered in Canada, the Company on their part should agree to maintain- r egistered agency in this country which should at all 08 in charge of a British subject, who should be the ^ reco^gnisedrecognissd ctiannel of coHununioaliioii between the Company ^ and His Majesty»s Government in the United Kingdom. It was also agreed that if the Company was to remain registered in Canada and to 'be presided over by the Cliainnan of the American group as was proposed, it would be difficult for His Majesty's Government to insist that the Chairman and the Managing Director (if any) of the Company should be British subjects. It was suggested, tiowevar, that if his Majesty's Government agreed to waive this condition, and to the Appointment of one British Dirscuor only out 01 five as proposed by the American group instead of the larger proportion originally proposal, the American group should be requested to agree that the British member of the Board of Directors of the Company should be nominated by His Majesty's Government in Canada in consultation with His Majesty's Government in Uhe United Kingdom, and that his salary as Director should be provided by the Company. With regard to the question of the local employees of the Company other than their chief representative in Bahrein, it was agreed that the formula originally suggested by the Colonial Office was preferable to the alternative suggested by the American group, and should be insisted upon It was agreed that the Colonial Office should endeavour to obtain the concurrence of the other interested Departments of His Majesty's Government in the revised conditions now proposed, and, when this had been done, should commuincate those conditions to the Syndicate by letter with a full explanation of the reasons which ie.idered ne G Q ssary insistence upon condition (d). The representative of the Syndicate expressed the pe if&gt; as appeared to be the case, the modifications tentatively suggested represented the extreme limit of the Co n.jessions which His Majesty's Government were prepared to it would be made clear in the letter communicating revised conditions that His Majesty's Government woula 0t Prepared to consider any further modification ofQ ftliose conditions. The representatives of the Syndicate (jonsiis^ that, if this was done, their task of endeavouring induce the American group to accept those conditions would fte facilitated. fae representatives of the Syndicate iid not consider that any useful purpose would he served lay further negotiation with Major Davis in this country, fuey therefore proposed to inform him generally of the result of their conversations at the Colonial Office, and to explain that no further progress could he made in the matter until the other interested Departments of His Majesty* Majesty's Government, and possibly also the Government of India, had heen consulted, and that some further del^ was therefore inevitable. They hoped that in the circumstances Major Davis would return to the United States to report to his Principals, In any case, Mr. Jans on and Major Holmes proposed, on receipt of the promised letter from the Oolonial Office, themselves to proceed to the United States in order to negotiate direct with Mr. Wallace the Chairman of the American group, and thoy anticipated ttat, with the explanation to he furnished hy the Colonial Office and with those which they themselves would he able to provide, they would fi'Jtp. it possible to secure Mr. Wallace's acceptance of the conditions proposed. It was also agreed that the Oolonial Office letter coauiiunicating the revised conditions should stipulate that steps would he taken hy the Syndicate or the American group which would prejudice the position of the proposed sites for^landing ground and sea-plane station in Bahrein, precise location of which would he communicated to tae Syndicate as soon as possible.Downing Street, August General Syndicate, ' Limited. Sir, I am directed 'by Lord Passfield to refer to ttie conrersation with Mr. Janson and Ma^or Holmes which took place at the Colonial Office on the 8th of August last,, and to inform you that His Majesty^ G-overnment have had under consideration the question of the conditions upon which they would he prepared t advise the Sheikh of Baiirein further to extend the period of the exploration licence granted to the Eastern and General Syndicate in virtue of the Agreement concluded 'between the Syndicate and the Shaikh on the End of December, 1925, and to agree to the assignment of the Syndicated rightsunder that Agreement to a new Company controlled 'by Americam interests.

Those conditions are as follows : - (a.) That the Company formed to take over the Concession from the Syndicate shall he and remain a British Company registered in Canada hut shall maintain a registered office in Great Britain which shall at all times lae in the charge of a British subject, who shall te the reco^gnised channel of communicauion between the Company and His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom of Great Britair|and Northern Ireland. (t) That of the five Directors of the Company one Director shall at all times be a British subject who shall be a Government nominee and whose salary as Director shall be provided by the Company. ( c ) That the Company shall at all times maintain in Bahrein an official to be called the Chief Local Representative'of the Company whose appointment shall K approved by His Majesty's Government in the United I Kingdom and who shall be the sole representative of the f Company empowered to deal direct with the local authorities and population in Bahrein.

(a) That as many of the employees of the Company in jiaiirein as is consistent with the efficient carrying on of the undertaking, shall at all times he British suhjects or subjects of the Shaikh of Bahrein. 2, I aiu to explain that His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom attach great importance to the acceptance of these conditions and are not prepared to agree to their modification. The third or these conditions which (Ityis essential to the harmonious working of the enterprise, is imposed as much in the interests of the operating Company as of His Majesty*s Government. In the opinion of His Majesty's Government it is essential that if the oil resources of Bahrein are to he profitaoly exploited, the relations 'between the Company engaged in such exploitation and the local authorities and population in Bahrein should be maintained upon a satisfactory and friendly has is. To secure this end, it is ahso^flutely necessary in the view of His Majesty's sorernment that^ should he no douht in the minds of such local authorities and population as to who is the Chief Local representative of the Company and that such local ^representative should he not only -persona ^rata with Majesty's Government and with the local authorities in Bahrein,, but also familiar with the conditions prevailing in the Arabian littoral of the Persian Gulf. Koreov er in view of the predominant position of this country in those regions and thf^ prestige attaching hereto It is highly £esirahle that the principal r6 Presentati^ of the Company should be a British subject. His Majesty's Government also desire to receive anan assurance from the Syndicate that neither/ Syndicate* nor the Company to which it is proposed that the rights ol' the syndicate should he assigned, will take any steps wUich would prejudice the position of the proposed sites for a landing ground and seaplane station in Bahrein, the precise location of which wil he coiainunicated to the Syndicate as sood as possible. 4, If the Syndicate are prepared to accept the conditions referred to ahoae and to furnish the assurance referred to on the preceding paragraph. His Majesty*3 GoTernment will he prepared to adYise the Shaikh of Bahrein further to extend the period of the exploration licence granted to the Syndicate in rirtue of the Agreement concluded between the Syndicate and the Shaikh on the End of December, 1925, # and to agree to the assignment of the Syndicate's rights under that Agreement to the new Company, the assignment to be a formal document and to he made expressly subject to 'the aoove conditions and to contain proTision for the cancellation of the Concession upon any hreach of those conditions. 5.

I am desired to thank you for your letters of the 16th and 20th instant, 69035/29, the former setting out the terms upon which His Majesty's Government would be prepared to advise the Sheikh of Bahrein further to extend the period of the exploration licence granted to th© Eastern and General Syndicate in virtue of the Agreement concluded between the Syndicate and the Sheikh on the End of December 1925, and to agree to the assignment of th© Syndicate's rights under that Agreement to a new Company controlled by American interests. The conditions submitted by you are now under consideration by our American friends and I am to say that arrangements are being made for Mr. E.W, Janson and Major Frank Holmes to proceed to America at the earliest possible moment in order that your letters and the views you have expressed in interviews with those gentlemen may be submitted and discussed personally ^ith the principals of the American interests, I note the contents of your letter of th© ^•Oth instant in reference to the site or sites for th© landing ground in Bahrein, and await your further letter 0 Q this subject as promised.

It would appear that in December 1925 an original concession for the operation of a petroleum fieia in the Bahrein Islands was conceded by the Shoik of Bahrein to the Eastern and General Syndicate, a British company• In November 1927 this syndicate gave to the Gulf Oil Conpany of Pennsylvania an option contract covering this concession, but the latter company, since it was a rnenber of the American group, was debarred from operating in the Bahrein Islands by the terms of the Turkish Petroleum Company agreement signed on July 31st, 1928. On December 21st, 1928, the Gulf Company, with the consent of the Eastern arp General Syndicate, assigned its rights to the Standard Oil Company of California under the above option, and the latter company, in turn, organized a Canadian subsidiary to hold and operate the con* cession. Under the terras of the option contract it would appear that the Eastern and General Syndicate undertook to secure from the Colonial Office a renewal of the concession for one year from the date of its expiry, December 2nd, 1928. The Colonial Office, however, when approached in October 1928 by the syndicate made its approval of a renewal oontengent upon the insertion in the original concession agreement of a clause providing, inter alia , that the concessionaires should be a British registered company; furthermore, that the , managing% fflanaging director and tho tnajority of the other directors should b® British subjects, and that foreigners should not control directly or indirectly any of the rights and privileges granted in the concession by the Sheik of Bahrein. The holding or operation of the concession by a company directly or indirectly controlled by Americans would effeclmally be excluded by the insertion of such a clause In the agreement ♦ Embassy of the United States of America, London, April 3, 1989,I 1 5 ,252l/28l/91).

His Majesty's Government would suggest that these conditions should form the subject of direct discussion between representatives of the Eastern and General / Syndicate, as being the existing conoessionnalres, and the Colonial Office. 3. With regard to the oral request which you made on April 3rd to a member of this department for a statement of the policy of His Majesty's Govemraent with regard to the holding and operation , in territories■in territories such as the Bahrein Islands, of petroleum concessions by foreigners , I have the honour to inform yon that His Majesty*s Government feel bonnd to reserve to thenselves the right to consider on its merits, and in the light of the circumstances obtaining at the time, each proposal for the holding or operation of petroleum consessions by foreigners in such territories, and that they therefore find themselves unable to make any general statement of their policy on this question such as the United States Govemnent desire# I have, etc., (For the Secretary of State).

I am, etc., (Signed) 0.G.R.WILLIAMS. 1 ■ I 'BH Ihe Secretary, Eastern and General Syndicate Limited.An Interdepartmental Conference was held at me Golonial Office on Friday, 7th June, to consider the question of what conditions should govern the participation of United States capital in the operation of the Concession granted by the Sheikh of Bahrein to the Eastern and General Syndicate Limited, for the exploitation of oil in the Bahrein Islands * There were present;- Hr .C .G.R. Williams (in the Chair), Mr.H.G. Bushe. Mr.J.H.Hall. Mr.W.J.Bigg Colonial ) Office. ) Lord Monteagle. ) Ir.G.Jebb. ) Forei^i Mr.$.H.Thomson. ) Office. Hr.J,G.Laithwaite. India Office. Mr.H.R.t.Giffard, Petroleuni Department. The Chairman explained briefly the events which had led up to the calling of the Conference, and the questions which had to be considered. Mr.Bushe stated that it seemed desirable in the first Instance to consider upon what grounds His Majesty's (Jovernraent were entitled to impose conditions upon the participation of United States capital In the operation of the Concession. The Concession held by the Syndicate provided for the grant to that Company of an exploration licence entitling the Company to the exclusive right, for a period not exceeding two years from the 2nd of December, 1925, to explore for oil throughout the vshole of the territories controlled by the Sheikh. That licence, which expired on the 1st of December, mm * *of -December, 1927, had. In accordance with-the provisions of the Oonoession, been renewed for a further period of one year. In October, 1928, the 1 . I Syndicate had submitted to the Colonial Office an application lor the renewal of their exploration ' licence for a further period of one year from the 2nd of December, 1928. The Syndicate were informed that if they would give an undertaking in specified terms which would ensure that the operation of the Concession would at all tiaes be and remain under British control. His Majesty's Government would be prepared to recoiamend the Shsikh of Bahrein to grant the Syndicate the renewal desired. The Syndicate, however, had already entered into an agreement with certain ^icerican interests for the transfer of their rights under the ConccsBion to raerican control, and were not, therefore, prepared to give the undertaking desired by His Hajesty's Government. The renewal asked for by the Syndicate was, in consequence, not granted and their exploration licence duly expired on the 1st of December, 1928, negotiations with His Majesty's Government had, how ever, been continued by the Syndicate, in the hope that, notwithstanding the fact that their rights under the concession had passed into American control, His Malesty's Government would feel able to recommend the Sheikh to renew the exploration licence for a further period of one year. had asked that the sum of fls,lC,000 rhich ho had paid to the Sheikh of Bahrein on the ^nd of December, Subsequently, the local 'gent of the Syndicate 1928,w) l In anticipation of the renewal of the exploration lioenoe, should, if that renewal was not granted, be utilised in payaent for a prospecting lioenoe to run from that date. In the Concession granted to the Syndicate by the 3heikh t the latter undertook M on behalf of himself anu his s mcessors, to grant to the Syndicate on application, either after the e^jrv of. or clurint* the period of the exploration licence or any extension or renewal thereof granted to the Syndicate, a prospecting licence in respect of certain areas in Bahrain to be selected by the Syndicate. The rights of the Syndicate at the present time appeared to depend mainly upon the interpretation to be placed upon the words 'after the expiry of.« If those words were interpreted to mean that, 'at any time ' after the expiry of their exploration licence, the Syndicate had the right to demand from the Sheikh or his suocessors the grant of a prospecting licence, $hich carries the right to a mining lea-ne in the terras in the Schedule, the position would be that the Sheikh was for all tise estopped from allowing any other person or persons to prospect for oil in his territories until the Syndicate had applied for and obtained the grant of a prospecting licence and had aeleox.ed the areas in Bahrein to which that licence was to apply. This would mean that the Syndicate would be in a pssition to hold up indefinitely the development of Bahrein which was a reductio ad absurdura « In Mr.Bushe^ view, having regard to the terms of the Ooncossion as a whole, the onlyonifyreasonable and therefore the proper interpretation to be placed upon the words n on application either after the expiry of or during the course of tho period of the exploration licence' was «on application during the period of the exploration licence or upon its expiry, n If that were so it could be argued that the exploration licence granted to the Syndicate had expired on the 1st of December, 19S8, and had not so far been extended or renewed, and that as the Syndicate had not applied either before or upon that date for the grant of a prospecting licence, they were not now entitled to claia such a licence and their Concession had lapsed. In that case it night be said that Kir Majesty 1 s Government were in a position to itapese upon the Syndicate any conditions which they might wish before agreeing to recommend the Sheildj to renew the Syndicated exploration licence for a further period of one year froa the ^.d of December, !&amp;'£. If the Syndicate refused to accept these conditions and claimed, in accordance with the ter -S3of their Con eesion, th t the question should be referred to arbitration, the position of tho Sheikh and of His Majesty's Government in the matter could however, in Ir.Bushefcs view, hardly be said to be unassailable. Although there was no express provision in the Oonoonsion vshich would entitle the Sheilch to refuse to agree to the renewal of the exploration licence '{seroly because the oyndicste * s t ir^hts under the Conoesnion had been transferred to American interestsInterests, it would, In Mr .Busha »s view, be possible to contend that the Goncession had been granted to a particular British Company and that the Sheikh was under no obligation to grant an exploration licence to the American interests to which tho Syndicate's rights under the Concession had been transferred. This contention was, however, of doubtful expediency as It fiould be possible for the rl hts under the Concession to remain in the Syndicate which could be reconstructed so that its control became American. Mr.Bushe suggested, therefore, that it should be explained to the Syndicate that their exploration licence had expired on the let of December, 19283, and that, in the absence of any extension or renewal of that licence, the were not entitled to claim the grant of a prospecting licence as their Concession had lapsed, but that if they were prepared to agree to the conditions which His Majesty^ Government wished to impose upon the introduction of /merioan capital into the operation of the Concession, Bis Majesty's Government would be prepared to recommend the Sheikh to rene?^ their exploration licence for a period of one year, fro- the 2nd of December, 1935. This renewal, if granted, would enable the Syndicate to apply in due course for the grant of a prospecting licence. This suggestion was agreed to. It was suggested that the Syndicate might contend that their Concession made no provision for the introduction of the conditions which His Majesty's Govemrsent had sought to impose, and that as it was only im^umsssmm \1 (m) only the desist of His !aa^®sty*8 GovernKient to Impose these conditions upon the Syndicate which had prevented their being granted the renewal for which they had applied, they were still entitled to claim that renewal. llr.Bushe considered, however, that in that event it would be possible for His Majesty^ Government ■I to take the line that the Syndicate had not established that the renewal for which they had applied was Justified on its merits, but that nevertheless, His Majesty»s Government were prepared, if the Syndicate would accept the conditions referred to, to recommend the Sheikh to grant the renewal for which the Syndicate had asked. The question of what conditions should govern the participation of American capital in the / |l operation of the Concession was then considered. Mr.Laithwalte stated that the India Office thought that the conditions imposed should be as stringent as possible, in order that the operation of the Concession might remain as far as possible under British control. The colonial Office and Foreign Office representatives however, pointed out that, having regard to the terms of the Note which had been addressed by the Foreign Office to the American Embassy, it was not now possible to do aiore than to provide for the retention of a British element In the directing and operating After some discussion it was agreed that ** insert ) fjgraph sug )~ Staff, in No.76.) the conditions to be imposed by the Syndicate should be as follows;- (a) The Company to be formed to take over the Concession to be and remain a British Company registered in Great Britain? (b) The(b) the Ghainuan and the Managing Director (if any) of the Company to be at all times British subjects; (e) a proportion of the Directors (between, say 4911% and 35V3%), to be agreed upon between the parties, to be at all times British subjects; and (d) the local General Manager of the Company and the whole of the local Staff, with certain exceptions to be agreed upon between the parties, to be at all times British subjects or subjects of the Sheikh of Bahrein. It was agreed that these suggested conditions should be cocmunioated officially to the interested Departments for concurrence before they were communicated to the Syndicate. The question of the attitude to be adopted by His !lajesty»s Governnent in the event of American interests desiring to participate in the development of oil in Kuwait was then considered, as this question was likely to arise as soon as the questions outstanding in regard to the Syndicated Oil Concession in Bahrein had been disposed of. It was pointed out that the position in Kuwait differed from that in Bahrein in that Kuwait had been excluded from the scope of the agreement concluded between the various groups comprising the Turkish Petroleum Company, and that no Concession for the development of oil in Kuwait had yet been granted, though an application for such a Concession had been submitted b the Eastern and General Syndicate. It was generally agreed that it would be desirable to resist the Introduction of American interests into Kuwait, and it -as suggested that, if and when a convenient opportunity presented itself. Sir J.Cadman might be sounded as to the possibility of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company applying for an Oil Concession in that territory *Mr.Janson and Ma^or Holmee of the Eastern and General Syndicate called to see Kir John Shrtckburgh on Friday the 19th of July. Mr.Williams, Mr.Bushe and Mr.Bigg were present during the interview. The representatives of the Syndicate t explained the reasons which had led them to transfer to American interests the rights which they possess in virtue of their agreement with the Shaikh of Bahrein. The Syndicate themselves had spent over £50 ,000 in epKloring for oil in Bahrein and their American friends had, it was estimated, spent a further £15 ,000 on the same object. The Syndicate had come to the end of their resources and although t! ey had explored every possible avenue they had been unable to obtain assistance from British capitalists to enable them to exploit their Concession. They had therefore been forced to obtain assistance from American oil interests and in return had transferred to those interests their rights under the Concession granted to them b;; the Shailsh of Bahrein. In transferring those rights they had mad© certain stipulations, which they had anticipated would be acceptable to His Majesty*s Government, to ensure that those rights should be exercised by a British Company, and, in fact, the American oil interests concerned had already registered in Canada a Company formed for the express purpose of continuing the operation of the Concession. At no stage during the course of the discussion did the representatives of the Syndicate attemptattempt to dispute the right of His Majesty's Government or the Shaikh of Bahrein to impose conditions upon the participation of American capital in the operation of the Concession or upon the transfer to American oil interests of the rights conferred by the Concession. It was therefore unnecessa -y to make use of the various arguments referred to in the recent correspondence with the other interested Departments of His Majesty^s Government, though It is, of course, possible that when the Syndicate came to talk to their American friends about the conditions which His Majesty*s Government desire to impose, those American interests will raise the question. When informed of the conditions upon which His Majesty's Government would be prepared to advise the Shaikh of Bahrein to agree to the participation of American capital in the operation of the Concession the representatives of the Syndicate were at first doubtful of their ability to induce their American friends to accept those conditions. After further discussion, however, the representatives of the Syndicate came round to the view that the conditions proposed were on the whole not unreasonable, Mr.Janson at first considered that, having regard to the fact that the American oil interests concerned had already registered a Company in Canada for the express purpose of the operation of the Concession in Bahrein, they would oppose the suggestion that a Company should be registered in thiscountry# He eventually agreed, however, that the proposal \ms not unreasonable and undertook to endeavour to secure Ite acceptance by his nerican friends. Both I'r•Jenaon and Major Holmes considered t at It would be difficult, if, indeed, not impossible, to secure the assent of their American friends to the suggestion that the local General Manager and the whole of the local staff, with certain exceptions to be agreed upon between the parties, should be at all tines British subjects or subjects of the Shaikh of Bahrein, American oil magnates had a very low opinion of British directing staff and were likely to desire to employ American subjects as their local technical staff. Their American friends attached such importance to the retention in the hands of r nerioan engineers of the control of the technical work to be carried out in Bahrein that, although they night be prepared to agree to the appointment of a British subject as their local General -fanager, they were unlikely to agree that more than a small proportion of their local technical staff should be British subjects. Insirtrnoo on the acceptance of the condition proposed might result in the refusal of their American friends to participate in the operation of the Concession vith the result that the cil resources of Bahrein would not at present be exploited. After some discussion the representatives of the Syndicate agreed that ii the condition in question could be amended by the omission of the words 'the whole the local staff, with I 1with certain axoeptlons to be agreed upon between the parties,' and the Ineertion In Xleu of the words as nany o« the local staff as is consistent with the efficient carrying out of the undertaking' they would do their utooat to induce their American friends to accept the conditions proposed. Sir John bhuckburgh agreed to the amendment suggested. It was agreed that the Colonial Office should write to the Syndicate setting out the conditions which it wss proposed should govern the participation of American capital in the operation the Concession and that the Syndicate would then endeavour to secure the assent of the American oil interests concerned to those conditions and report the result of their negotiations to the Colonial Office in due course, r*Janson and Major Hoi es .ere informed that it was unlikely that His Majesty*8 Government would be prepared to consent to any further modification of the conditions proposed, to which considerable importance was attached by other interested Departments of His Majesty 1 ® Government and it was agreed that if the Syndicate were unable to induce their American friends to accept those conditions the whole question should then be made the subject of further discussion at the Colonial Office. Colonial Office. 20th July, 1229.(^) Mr,.Tans on and la^or HSlraes of the Eastern and General Syndicate called to see Sir John huckburgh on Wednesday, 31st July. Mr.Williams, ...r.uiishc and Mr, Hall were present at the interview. Sir Joh n ' huclcbur^ h explained that as a result of the discussion held on the 19th July with representatives of the Syndicate, a letter was prepared in the Colonial Office coramunloating the conditions upon which H.r.G. would be prepared to advise the Sheikh of Bahrein to agree to the extension of the exploration licence granted to the Syndicate and to the 'ssignraent of their Concession. This letter was on the point of being despatched to the Syndicate wheh Hr. Jans on telephoned to ask that the despatch of the letter should be postponed pending a further discussion. It was in accordance with this request that the present Meeting had been called. Kr.Janson explained that since the Meeting of the 19th July he and Major Holmes had had an opportunity to discuss with Major Davis, the represen~ tativo of the /merlean group holding the option on the Syndicate's Concession, the conditions which H.M.G. wished to impose as disclosed at that Meeting. He had ascertained from Major Davis that his principals took the following view in regard to the four proposed conditions (a) They were not prepared to agree to the registration in Great Britain of the Company formed to operate the Concession. They had already forced a Company for that purpose in Canada, which, as being within easy reach of theirtheir headquarters in the United States, could be controlled therefrom. They contemplatea that the Directorships of the new Company should, for the most part, be filled by the appointment of Directors of their own group, who, for the purpose of Board Meetings, oould, without undue inconvenience, travel to Canada. They had no organisation in this country,which would enable them to operate a Company in London. Ta do so, therefore, would involve the setting up of a special organisation for the purpose. Another objection was that the taxation of Companies registered in this country was extremely heavy, much more so than in Canada. They were not prepared to agree that the Chairman and Managing Director of the new Company should at all times be a British subject. It was their intention that the Chairman of the group in America should also officiate as Chairman of the new Company, and that the Managing Director (if any) should-also be one of the Directors or Officials already associated with the .American group. Of the five lirectors contemplated, they were only prepared to agree that one should be a British subject. As they were providing the whole capital for the enterprise, they considered it essential that full controloontroi should rest In th© hands of their group. (d) They were not prepared to agree that the local .lanager in charge of th© Company's operations in Bahrein should at all times be a British mihjedt, although they wore willing to appoint a British subject to act as Liaison Officer and to he eaployed for all negotiations with th© Lheikh of Bahrein and with the local population# He would, however, be suljaot to the authority of the local Manager who would be a technical official in charge of the Field operations of the Company. It would be entirely opposed to their organisation to appoint a non-technical Manager. Sir John Shuclcbargh pointed out that in their counter proposals the 'laerican group in effect rejected all the conditions proposed by H.M.G-. except to the extent of the admission of one British Director to th© Board of th© Comapny. H© felt so.a© doubt vtiether th® Syndicate's American associates fully appreciated the position. Without H.M .G.*s good will and support they could not obtain or work this Concession at all. As the price of that good will, H.tJ.G.Iiad laid down certain entirely reasonable conditions. These, he was satisfied, represented the minimum requirements of H.M.G. The fourth condition, that in regard to the % nppoint lent of a British local Manager, was as much in thein the inter© at of the Company as of fUM.G., although I the latter attached the greatest possible iraportanoe ■ to this condition. Possibly the American group did not realise that had it not been for the services rendered by Great Britain in the Persian Gulf during txi© last hand red years, there could have been no question today of working an oil concession in those 1 areas. This country, by sacrifice of men and money, had taade the Gulf safe for enterprises of this character, and they had every right to impose such conditions on the conduct of commercial enterprises in those regions as they considered necessary in the furtherance of their policy of pacification and the promotion of prosperity in the Gulf States# Mr&gt;Janson said that all this had been explained to the American group on more than one oooasion, but that they apparently felt that as they were providing all the capital they should 'call the tune.» ir John Sbuokburah asked to which of the four conditions the Americano attached the greatest importance. Mr.Janson replied that undoubtedly his American associates attached the greatest importance to condition (d). He thought it possible that if this could be settled to the satisfaction of both parties the remaining three conditions could be disposed of with less difficulty. he mericans apparently had a very low opinion the managerial abilities of British subjects. They regarded the control of the local operations as the Vital considera tion in the successful production of oil, and they wore notnot preparec 1 that this control should be delegated to either a British subject or to a person without the highest technical qualifications. Their local Manager must, in their opinion, be an official in $&amp;o:a they had full confidence. They were aware of no British subject who would satisfy this requirement. Ha^or Heroes asked whether it would satisfy K,M,G. if it were laid down that no representative of the Company should approach the Shaikh except through the British Political Agent at Bahrein. Sir John -Ihuckburnh said that it was essential that a British subject should be the chief local representative of the He must be the Conpany^s HMaber One 1 in Bahrein. It was, he thought, a matter of indifference to H.M.G, whether or not he had any control over the technical operations of the Conpan; . The relations between the British anager and the official in charge of the technical operations v as a matter of internal arrangement within the Company, and one with which H.*■:=.&amp;. were not concerned. But it was, from their point of view, essential that the Company^ official charged with responsibility for all dealings with the Sheikh and the local authorities should be a British subject and should, nofinally at least, be the Chief local representative of the vOKipassy. He would have thought that such an arrangement was in the interest of the Company themselves. H.M.G. would, he thought, be perfectly satisfied if Major Holaes were appointed as the Company'K local ManagerManager at Bahrein. if the '-nerican group f'6re so avers© froin agreeing to the principle of the appointment of a British subject, could it nob he mutually agreed that Major Holmes should be the first looal General Manager, and that the appointment of his successor should be subject to the approval of H.M.G, Ife^jor Koikes said that, for his part, he would be prepared to accept the post,and he thought it possible that such en appointment would be aocoptable to the American group. In conversations ■h?'■. he had had with Jr.Wallace, who virtually * controlled the Aiaeriean group, he gathered that he had won the latter* g confidence• Indeed Lr, Wallace had on one occasion pressed him to take up an Important appointment on behalf of the group in Venezuela. It v.as finally agreed that the r.yndlcato should tentatively suggest to their ftiaerican associates the adoption of the following variant of condition (d), and ascertain whether it would be acceptable. They \70uld make it clear that this v?iriant had not been accepted by H. .G. and could not be so accepted without further reference to the Interested Government Departments:- ^There Shall at all times be a looal General Manager who shall bo approved by His - sweety's Oevemnent. He shall be the Chief Representati- of the ;otnpany in Bahrein and shall be responsib for all relations with the local authorities and oopuiation. All coawunication with the ^heilsh or behalf of the Company, shallbe through the T ritish Political / gent. For the iirst five ..ears after the inception of the enterprise the local tJencral Manager shall be .lajor Holmes.' In the coarse of the discussion, It was mentioned to the Syndicated representatives that H.M.G.wotiia require tin aesuranc© from the Syndicate that no eteps would be taken nhioh would prejudice the position of the proposed site for the landing ground and eea-piane station, the precise location of which would be comnunicated to them in the near future. 'Ihe Syndicate's representatives said that they did not anticipate any difficulty with their American associates on this aoore, and they promised to mention the matter to the latter at an early date. It was agreed that in any letter sent to the Syndicate setting out the conditions governing the ssignment of the Concession, a clcuse to tbe above effect should be inserted. It was agreed that a further Meeting between representatives of the Colonial Office and of the yndicate should be held on Thursday, the 8th of August at 3.50 p«nuMOTS or CONFERDNOB V.'ITH EASTHHW AIlD G'^IBHAL nTOVICAIS.

(b) The Managing Director and/or Chairman canncfc be British, as Americans are providing all the capital and th® Gulf Oil Goapany have no Foreign representatives on any of their Boards• % (c) The Americans agree one Director to be British out of five, but he may only hold his qualification shares. (d) The 1(&lt;!) The Americans- agree that a person satisfact ory to tho British Govornment would b© j employed with title of Special 'Delegate Special Agent foreign Representative or Special Hepresentatlve of the company, who would directly handle with the Sheikhs under consultation with the British Political Agent all matters of business nature necessary to be taken up with the Sheikhs and also all matters of Political or Diplomatic nature to be taken up with the bheikhs. In all such business matters such would be guided by advice and suggestions of Local Manager of the Company, but as respect all Political or Diplomatic matters involving policy such would be guided by advice and suggestions of the Hone Office of the Parent owning Company. (e) The Americans agree that as many British shall be employed in the Company as consistent with the efficient working of the property. Sir John Shuckburgh again wamod the representatives of the Syndicate that no modification of the conditions coamunicated to them on the 19th Oi July could be agreed to without consultation with the other interested Departments of His Majesty's Government, and that any modification tentatively agreed upon in the course of the present conversations- _ - ,convorGatlons would imve to be referred to those i-'Opart'-tiBnts for eonourrentoe # In, Sir John Hhuokburgh's view, condition (d) was the most iaportant condition, both from tha point of viow of the A^arioan group and from triat -- - ^esty 1 -'.cvsm ';nt, and thi': condition was therefore disoussod in the first instance. ...r. Jans on explained that the American group had not felt able to accept in its entirety the vari&amp;it of this condition proposed at the Meeting of the Slst of July. They had expressed their readiness to agree to the appointment of Major ^ Holmes as their looal representative in Bahrein for v the purpose of conducting business with the Sheikh ■ ■: ' . ■ . ' ' „■ r \ of Bahrein, in consultation with the Political \ Agent, but they were not prepared to confer upon him' the title of r.ocal General Manager or Manager, or to -iilow hi . to control in any my the technical operations of the Company in Bahrein; nor were they prepared at thi- stage to conclude a contract with Ha^or Holmes for a period of five years, as, until they h:M ■ operations in Bahrein and had ascertained that oil was to be found there in 30: m- rctally payable quantities, they were not in a position to say whether their operations in Bahrein would extend over so long a period as five years. tr John Shuckburgh stated that he appreciated why the American group were unwilling at thir stare to -ive Ha .lor Holmes a definite appointment for afor a period of five years, but that, vvhile the position mii^ht be reasonable In so far as related to Major Hoiraes, it could not be Bai^ to 'oe satisfactory from the point of view of His Majesty's Government. In hie view it was essential to malte it clear that Major Holmes . or whoever else was apoointed with the approval of His Majesty 1 a Government as fl the local representative of the Company for the purpose of their relations with the local authorities | in Bahrein, was the chief representative of the Company in Bahrein, and was the only representative of the Company who was empowered to deal with those authorities. It was also essential that his appointment should for a definite period of five years in the first instance, or for such lesser period as the Company might continue to conduct 1 its operations in Bahrein. If the Company discontinued opemtions the need for the appointmeat obviously ceased; but it was neceasary to provide against a different contingency, viz:- that tha Company might, at an early stage in the proceedings, and without any question arising of a discontinuance of operations, remove tha reprecentative approved by His Majesty's Government and invite our concurrence in the appointment of a successor about whose suitability it might be difficult for us to satisfy ourselves. It was as much in the interests of the Company as of His llajesty's Govern- raent that the chief local representative of the Company should be pergo na IJSSiS. ^ith His Majesty's C-cveifr-ont, -nd *3&gt;»9 the local authorities in Bahrein. Wewe believe that five years experience would bmi f ice fully to convinoe the Company of this, and to satisfy them that it ms desirable, in their interests, to oontinue to employ a suitable I ;ritU:h subtest as their chief local representative in Bahrein* £ir John Shuoicburgh did not think that txiere was any need for the chief local representative of the Company to control their technical operations in Bahrein; the question of hi a relations with the official in charge of the technical operations was entirely a matter for the Ccnpany, which • ct ' 3 entionec in the conditions governing the r ar: irnment of the -tcnoes eion. iter some discussion it was agreed that condition (d) sight be redrafted to make it clear that Ma^or Holues should be appointed as the chief local representative of the Ooniarsy in Bahrein, and that the oo..peny should be under an obligation to His Majesty*a Crovemnent to saploy him in that capacity for a period of five years in the first instance, or for such lesser period as the Company were operating in Bahrein, and that he should be the only otficial of the company who empowered to deal with the local authorities and population in Bahrein. It mn also agreed that the Colonial Office should furnish the Syndicate a reasoned explanation of the circ uhus tances which rencierGd it essential to impose this condition. As regards the remaining conditions, it was agreed that in all the circumstances, the contention of thethe American gimip the t they should not be ract^ired to reginter e fresh Company in this ecuntry, - IrHt V: re^ r le/ \3 ronsonabX#| and it was sugcoeted as an alternative that, if His Majesty^ t agreed that the Company foraed to take over the oc.icessicn should remain regis to red in Canada, the Oompary en their part should agree to maintain a registered agency in this country which s ^ c tiI 11 I ' i:: charge of a British subject, who '•bailie; be the rocognieed channel of comnunicaticua between the Company and Hia Majesty's Government 'in the United Kingdom# It vws also agreed that if the Company was to re iin regitoered in Oar - ;• and to be presided over by the Chair man of the American group as was proposed, it would be difficult for His Majesty 's Oovemsent to insist that the Chairman and the Managing Director (It any) of the Company should be British subjects. It was suggested, however, that if His Majesty's Government agreed to waive thifi condition, and to the appointment of one British Director only out of five as proposed by the American gro -p i-ntc;.- ^ of the larger proportion originally proposed, the Americen group should be requested to agree that the British member of the Board of Directors of the Ooapany should be nominated by His Majesty's Government in Canada in consultation with His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom, and that his salary as Director should be provided by the Company* 1 ith regard to the question of the local employees©raployees of the Ooiapany other than their chief representative in Bahrein, It was agreed that the iorswla originally suggested by the Colonial Office v.ias pre 1 arable to the alternative suggested by the American group, and should be Insisted upon* It was agreed that the Colonial Office should endeavour to obtain the conourrenoe of the other interested 'e part rents of■ His la jesty's Government in the revised conditions now proposed, and, when this had been done, should connunlcate those conditions to the Syndicate by letter with a full explanation of the reasons which rendered necessary Insistence upon condition (d). The representatives of the Syndicate expressed the hope that if, as appeared to be the case, the a. .1.1. .'cn tentatively suggested represented the e.xtre a 11 :.it of the concessions which His Majesty's Government were prepared to make, it vould be tEade clear in the letter ooramunicating the revised conditions that His Majesty 1 s Government would not be prepared to consider any further ■ ifications of those conditions. The representative of the Syndicate considered that, if this was done, their tesk of endeavouring to induce the American ■ptouo to accept these coneitlcAould b'- facilitated# The representatives of the syndicate die not consider that any useful purpose would be nerved by f'-'^th'-t* riv 'Otiation with Major • .i-;vis m this country. The^ therefore proposed to infor® hisa generally of the result of their conversations at the Colonial Office, and to explain that no further progress oouldbe mad© ia the matter until the other Interested Departments of Hie Majesty's Govemnent, and possibly also the Govemaient of India, had been ;C ' •''••••&gt; '■ '■ Ibftl dttti further delay was therefore inevitable, t ty hoped that in the circumstances Major Davis wtmM return to the Jnited states to report to his Principals. In any case, Mr. Janson and Ma^or r-olines proposed, on receipt of the promised letter from the colonial Office, themselves to proceed to tb^e United . tates in order to negotiate direct '..ith I.r•Wallace, the Chairman of the A m ®rlean groupj and they anticipated that, with the erplanati ns to be •furnished by the Colonial Office and with those vihich they themselves would be able to provide, they would find it possible to ccccre ^ r.r/Qllaoe'F accc-ptance of the conditions proposed. It was also agreed that the Colonial Office tetter communicating the revised conditions should stipulate that no steps wcfuld be taken by the Syndi cate or the American group which -ould prejitdice the position of the proposed sites for a landing r, round and sea -plane station in Bahrein, the precise location of ^hioh would be com;ami cated to the Syndicate as soon as possible.69035/29c .

I am enclosing,herewith, three copies of a draft Con cession Agreement drawn up, except for a few alterations required to describe the area now applied for, and a small addition in C.lause I. Schedule III (Mining Lease) referring to harbour rights, upon exactly the same terms and conditions as specified in the Bahrein Oil Concession dated 2nd December 1925. .&lt;.ou will note that the area now requested has an area of approximately 97,920 square acres. The harbour,the Company will require to develop in order to facilitate the handling of the Oil won from the area hereby applied for and from the area of our present concession, must have deep water and Khor-Kaliya and adjacent waters is the only one fulfilling this condition. There is one area,however, it is not agricultural land, which ray Company would prefer not to see alienated from Government hands at this moment. This area in greater part lies within the Territory covered by the present Bahrein Oil.Concession. The above mentioned area lies S.E. from Sheikh Ali's Bridge (Sakhir Road) a distance of 4 miles along the coast and two miles wide inland from high water mark, no part of the area lies N. of Sheikh Ali's Bridge, so does not interfere with date gardens. It extends South to a point opposite the Southernmost point of Sitra Island. This is almost entirely rocky land exceptcontinued: for a few yards from the coast line, there are a few dates palms at the Sitra end, hut they will not interfere with works necessary to develop the entrance and the harbour. This area is required upon v/hich to build tanks, refinery and pumping plants and make jetties and wharves etc., to connect with the deep water of Khor-Kaliya, Any other unoccupied land can he passed over quite readily without damaging the agricultural efforts to any appre ciable extent, if at all. In regard to the Agricultural project mentioned in your letter,as now being considered,that is the leasing out of unoccupied lands I do not think that this will interfere with the Company's operations, if we should find it necessary, to run pipe-lines, tramlines or roads over any portion of such lands it will not effect the leaseholder except to a small extent owing to the small area occupied. The copies of the draft Concession are for use as follows, should others be required they can be sent to you:- No. 1. To the Hon. The Political Resident,Persian Gulf. No. 2.

The harbour# the Company# will require to develop in order to facilitate the handling of the oil won from the CUULO l .for which they now apply and for the area of their present concession. They must have deep water and Khor Kalaiya and its adjacent waters is the only harbour fulfilling this condition.

No part of the area lies north of Radam Al Kauri,jt ©xtenda south to a point apposite the Southern raoat point of Sitra island. The Eastern and General Syndicate declare it is almost entirely rocky land except for a few yards from the coast line. There are a few date palms at the Sitra end# but they will not interfere with work necessary to develop the entrance and the harbour# . On this area the Oonpany hopes to build Tanks, Refinery# and Pumping Plants and to make Jetties and wharves to connect with the deep waters of Khor Kalaiya.

Sir, ^ ' In reference to my letter of the 1st May, which relates to the mean ing of a clause in the concession recently granted to the Easter^General Syndicate Ltd., I would further remark.- 1. The Government of Bahrein is the absolute owner of all the land on which the Customs premises stand, which includes the Import Shed, the Import Yard, the Customs Offices etc., bounded on the west by Customs Street, and on the East by Customs Road; also the 'foreshore', which extends from the Customs Mole on the East to the beginning of the Marina on the west, but not inci ling a piece of foreshore granted to Z.S.Yusuf Kanoo C.I.6., etc. on which he has built a dock; also the Customs Pier. Consequently the Government of Bahrein owns all property erected thereon, including the Import Shed, the offices etc. the railway lines, and trolleys and the Pier Shed. In addition the Government owns the building now known as the Police Station, and the building behind it, officially known as the Q.M.O's residence but now occupiea/by the Customs' Hindu clerks as free quarters, and the Customs Road and Customs Street. The Customs Pier is theoretically unfinished, the original intention having been to carry it forward to the other side of the 'Khor'. The cost was met by loans granted by merchants, which were repaid by a tax mow known as Pier Fees, levied on all imported cargo, the tax feeifig having been allocated, after repayment of the construction loans, to the upkeep and maintenance of the' Pier, although, as a matter of fact, it is now paid into the Consolidated Fund. The Pier v/as erected in 1335-1338 at a cost of Rs. 1,30,315-0-3., and further have ince been spent on it, by the Government of Bahrein. 2. In 1338, H.E.Sheikh Sir Easa bin Ahmed A1 Khalifa granted a sub sidy to the Baladia of Manama of a tax to be collected by the Customs known as the Baladia Tax which is actually twice the Pier Fees tax. Originally this sura was paid monthly to the Baladia but now it is paid into the Consolidated Fund andthe Consolidated Fund pays a subsidy of Rs. 48000/- per annum to the two Baladias of Manama and Maharaq. This sum is supposed to be the total of the Baladia Tax but it exceeds it. . 3 : Porterage of cargo from the custody of the Bahrein Landing company into Customs charge, which includes sorting, stacking, and moving: is Tind S :i Wh0 a 00ntra q t for ttis work with the Customs, and rknks ^ He is paid on a earfully worked out tariff which varies aeoordinR to the nature and size of the packages remored; e.g. Rs. 8/-$ for baes Rs id/ € for co^e, flour etc., as 2. per nong, as 4. bundle, or kegvofiyllktr ■ /- per large bundle, cask or orate.

The charge for Porterage is on account of money dis bursed for porting and stocking cargo* and aa regards Baladiyah for disbursements for maintenance of local Munici pal! ties j as regards Pier Fees for repairs and maintenance of the Pier* Pier Shed and import Shod.

I I I am also at a loss to understand the meaning of the paragraph which reads as follows:- ' If you would care to make an offer for such land as you may require, H.E. Sheikh Hamad will consider^i^t. 11 The Company will require this land as stated in my letter of May 5th, upon which to build tanks,refinery and pumping plants, make jetties and wharves etc; to connect with the deep waters of Khor Kaliya. If the Bahrein G-overnment mean that it wishes me to make an application and define the Areas the Company would require for the above purposes, I will be pleased to do so,basing my appli- cation on Article II. of the Third Schedule, both for the uncul tivated and private lands. The only unoccupied land that I know J 1 i of within the area mentioned in ray letter of Mav 5th, suitable for hi (i agricultural purposes is that piece of land which was at one time cleared to make an aerodrome,and lies to the North of Sakhir road U about one mile beyond Sheikh Ali's bridge. 14 The Area required by the Company could all be located toil the South of the road to Sakhir, this will leave the aerodrome outside the area mentioned in my letter of the 5th May and so be free for agricultural purposes. i. am * Sir, Your obedient servant. for anil in Mall of It Easleral General Spiafe.UiMBahrein. 19th, May 1928. To. His B. M' s Political Agent, B A H R E I N . Sir, . Pgr' I am in receipt of your No. 0/166 of 1928 dated the 16th May 1 92B for which I thank you. Before answering your queries specifically I would point out generally that the Agreement,made between the Ruler of lahrein and ray Syndicate, should be read as^whole and not in parts, lor instance the amount of Royalty can not be divorces ifrom the privileges bestowed by the Bahrein Government in grant ing raj Company the right of free import of machinery and other goods. The terms of the Agreement,under discussion^were agreed upon at a lengthy conference at the Colonial Office before it was submitted to H .E. Sheikh Hamad Bin Eheikh Esa Al-Khalifah At the conference referred to, the following persons were present ;- Major Young was in the chair. Two persons repre senting the Petroleum Section of the British Government. Two Co lonial Office Officials. Mr.Janson and I represented the Eastern and General Syndicate Limited. The whole trend of Major Young's efforts was to increa the amount of Royalty payable on the oil won. In order to increa, the Royalty he kas prepared to exempt the Concession holders from payment of all Custom Duties and Taxes usually payable to the Bahrein Government. That Major Young was successful can be seen by the ver^ Qyalty, of Rs.3-^-0. per ton on oil won, that is payable to the Bahrein Government (Article VIII Third Schedule). To reply in detail to your request asking for an inter- pretaoxon of Article V of First Schedule, Article VI of the Second schedule and Article IV of the Third Schedule, I submit th £ following: - '•12-5-28. The three Articles named in ^rour letter have each the same purport and were devised, to grant to the Concession holders, the right to import all materials free that are necessary for the development ana working of the oil won,from the Concession Area, in all its phases. In reference to your remarks on 'Import Yard Charges ,, it is possible that one or more of the items ennumerated and grouped under 'Import Yard Charges' may justly be made a charge against goods and materials imported by the Company. And I will take these items in the same order as you have named them (Par.2). — anch U~lJU^_i:,§nt| It is quite possible that this | question of storage, although such storage be made in the Bahrein .■Government Buildings and so come under charges exempted,may become a difficult question, as there is no limit as to how long goods may be left in the Custom Buildings. j .herefore, I am prepared to agree, that if the Company's goods,that come in under exemption, be left for a longer period than- 10 days without being removed from the Customs premi ses, that such goods, after the expiration of the above mentioned period of 10 days^ shall become liable for the ordinary rate of 'Khanchi Charges'. Porterage^.- The question of porterage Is one that may be considered as being doubtful,and as such,I am prepared on [behalf oj mv Company to agree that the Porterage Charges as speci fied under the Tindal's contract be made a charge against the jOompan/ ior all goods imported by way of the Custom's Pier. As much of the machinery that will be required,for the Purpose of developing and operating the oil won from the Conces sion Area,will b e heavy, and as no unloading facilities such as, ^ranes,winches etc; exist on the Custom's Pier for handling heavv materials, it follows, that the Com^ny operating the oil deposits' 'ill require to develop its own harbour,piers and unloadingI •5 - 19-5-50. facilities at Khor Kaliya or elsewhere, 'Port Dues' would not become payable o^ O oodc unloaded elsewhere than at the Custom's Pier. Ba ladiya h ; ^ The Baladiyali charge is eviuently a State Tax, and tllerefore the joxiuedBiou holder^ is exempt from taifc Tax. In any case the 0 oocU»,imported for operating the oil deposit,will not be passed through into the bazaar for sale as is the «ase witn orainary ^oods. Piej;- Tax ;- The Pier Tax is also a State Tax and therefore the Concession holder is exempt from the payment of this Tax. In reply to partagraph 6, I do not agree that the I exemption enjoyed by the Company under its Agreement with H.E. E. Sheikn amad Bin Esa A1—Khalif ah extends to Customs Duty onlv. It also extends to Taxes. I have given in details the charges I consider that . the Company are liable to pay. The above mentioned charges, in my opinion are the only ones that reasonably can be charged against the Company as Concession holder. I am. Sir, Your obedient servanl It 1v Ho.C/173 of 1928.

If the Bahrein Government wish nim to mke an applica tion and define the areas the Ccu^mny would require for the above purposes, Mag or Holmes will he pleased to do so, basing his application on article II of the Third Schedule of the Company's agreement, both for the uncultivated and private lands. He adds that the area required by the Com- pany could all be located to the south ( presumably east is intended) of the road to 3akhir. Xhis will leave the old aerodrome outside the area of the Company's operations and presumably will not interfere with any major agricul tural scheme that may be contempl&amp;'oaa.

They point out however that much of their machinery will be too heavy for handling at the Pier, and that they will have to develop their own harbour for this purpose. They consider that Baladiyah and Pier tax are State Taxes and as such not char^able ^gainst then under the terms of their concesal on.

Dir, fil y I have lo Uiank; you for the reply (C/32 dated $th Dul Haj 1546.) that you caused to he sent to me by the AdviSE to the Bahrein Government dealing with (a) 1?hat was meant by the word 'indefinitely 4 and (b) As to what was meant hy the paragraph which reads 'His Excel lency would he pleased to consider an offer for such land as the Eastern &amp; General Syndicate may Require', As regards (a) The letter G/32, above referred to, the definition therein of the terra 'indefinitely' does not appear to me to make the paragraph,in which it occurs,more clear. I am still at a loss to understand what the writer desires to convey. It may be that the Adviser is referring to something of which I do not know. The Eastern &amp; General Syndicate Limited as the Concession holder, does not wish, nor does it intend to interfere with the land operations of the Bahrein Government in any way. If the Bahrein Government wishes to dispose of its Agricul- cultural land by sale, it is entirely its own business and does not concern the Concession holder, except to see that the 'status quo 44 be maintained,as regards the rights and privileges of the Company. Dealing with (b) This question was not Bsswered in letter G/35^ The Concession Agreement defines,most clearly,the rights, payments and privileges etc; of the Concession holder in respect of both the Government's uncultivated lands and private lands (Third Schedule, Article II.). There is not any mention in the Concession Agreement that the Concession holder is permitted to make an 'offer' for land, and in aiscussing the Bahrein Concession Agreement at the Colonial'Office a strong stand was taken to prevent the acquisition of land,to hold in fee simple^ by the Comcession holder. It appears to me that this question is befenminK involved - to dear t h e position, I ^ « I may ear ^' ^ate, to discuss the doubt and make certain that we are all in accord ae to the actual point we are endeavouring to elucidate? 1 aB1 . . , Sir, Your obedient servant. 1 for aide; nalc! &gt; v He Eastern Si General Syicate, IMelBahrein June 5th, 1928 To.

I have no further remarks to make except that I would press the reasonableness of the Eastern general Syndicate paying the extra amount asked for. They have, I submit, on their first concession had an opportunity of investigating as to the advisability or otherwise of proceeding with their enterprise, and now as a result of the investigation they consider it is worth their while to take over the other half of the Shaikh's territory and his territorial water and con sequently they should pay for the privilege. I contend that this Government has a strong claim in this connection as the Eastern General Syndicate only applied for the new concession- having apparently made sure it was worth their while. n Adviser to The Government of Bahrein.No. C/l98 of 1928.

There is such a marked difference of opinion as to the | terras of the further Concession between the State Adviser and myselJ, that I see no chance of us reaching an Agreement, owing principally to the enormously Increased payments demanded. At the conference on June the 4th, I agrfed to certain alterations^ to the text of the Draft Agreement submitted to you on May the 5th 1928, under the impression that we were settling a final Draft to be submitted to The Hon'ble The Political Resi dent, but without the Knowledge that it was to be 'amended' later.

Political Agency, Bahrain. The 8th July 1929. From Major C.C.J. Barrett, C.S.X., C.Z.B., Political Agent, Bahrain. To The Secretary to the Hon. the Political Reeidnnt in the Perelan Gulf, Bushlre. y P. iso Sir 1 have the honour to infona you that Major Frank Kolmee, local repreeentatlfe of the Kaetem and General Syndicate has applied for an eagploring proepect- -ing and mining conceeeion for the area of the Bahrain Island not cohered by the agreement eigned fcy him and Hie Exoellonoy Sheikh Hamad on ^nd nece^bor 19£8. 1 enclose three oopies of an agreement for these conceseions, which has 'been drafted by Major Holmes. 2, The Bahrain Government, whom I have consult- -ed are prepared to grant a further concession only if the company will accept certain modification® proposed, whinVi are incorporated in the alternative draft which X have marked B. The alterations are underlined in red InK The main point of difforonce is that the State demands an increased rental for their leasts. The rental now demanded can be ooon from reference to the Articles of the Agreement. In lio^ 10,000 payc-hle under Article VI a sum of Bs 20,000 annually is now asked for the exploration lioenss while the annual pay- »ment for the prospecting license has heen raioect Rs 10,000' 7 Rf 10,000 to Rp SOjOOOo^t ia made clear that rcckonin to te made by the English and not the Arabic year„ In tht 0B.Beof tlic aining loaaea rtftrtno* is rtqutstod to Article m ©f t TMrd Sohedult. The Bahrain Goyernxnent rtquire the Company to pay them Re 20,000 annually in lieu of the Re 10,000 euggeeted Maj ot Holmes. The sums of Ks 30,000 mentioned in ArtioleVS of the fhird Schedule are accordingly raised to Bs 70,000. 3. Major Holmes considered himself unable to acoept these increased payments on behalf of his Company whereas the Bahrain State Adviser considers that, in the altered circumstances, since the first agreement was signed, the sums now demanded err if at all on the side of gemerosity to the Company. The Company has now had the advantage of 2jtyears exploration, hence they are not talcing the same risk as formerly. Their explorations have apparent -ly conTinced them that oil is to he found in the islands, and that it is worth their while to take over areas not already covered by their original agreement. Suoh being the case the State considers that they should he prepared to pay the extra price demanded. If the Company do not wish to pay, the State authorities are quite satisfied with the original agreement and do not desire to sign a new one. 4. The other points of difference are of minor importance. Major Holmes had agreed to meet the Bahrain Governments wishes, hut subsequently for what appear to he tactical reasons withdrew his consent^and re-submitted his original proposals, on hearing that tht Bahrain State pressed their demand for the increaseiC preliminary payments. I will take the Bahrain State*s modifioa- -tionu seriatim. .ArticleArticle VI.* Tnis lias already been discueecd above, firot Schedule. X. • The Sheikh cannot give the Company the right to enter the private property. He recognises their right to acquire private property by agreement with its owner and safsguards them against a ring to put up prices* IX. - It is made clear that the use of water for domestic purposes only is granted. This clause as originally drafted might be interpreted in such a way that water essential for date gardens would be diverted to other purposes. XII. - There is practically no fuel in Bahrain. The right to use such as is lying cn waste lands only is granted* V. - There is a public pier at Bahrainat which goods v are usually landed. The right of suppling porters is farmed out to a contractor. The State's wording of this article is intended to guard against the Bahrain State being put to actual loss owing to the porterage of the Company's material. In the same way The State asks to be guarded against the choking of their warehouses toy Company's goods left indefinitely in their charge. If the Company makes a private pier and ware- ••house in their concession no charge would be made for goods landed therein. VI. - The word n reasenable* does not require explana- -tion. Second schedule. I,III,IV,VI and VII. - These have already been explain- -ed under tfirst Schedule. Third Schedule. I. - The addition of the words ' saving and with c|u■ w respeot to aaorod buildings, slirineo caul grave yards*. II. • H Hesdtd « hap changed to ' ' neoessary to M . III. - Til© change from Bs 10,000 to Rs has already boon discussed. IV. - 2nd. paragraph, the inclusion of the words w Sulaj eot to the right of the Sheikh to recover porter* -age charges, and denurrage on goods remaining in his charge for a period in oxcess of 10 days on all goods entering Bahrain hy way of the existing Customs pier* has already been explained. - The reason for the alteration of figuree has already been explained. VI* • The words ' To take all reasonable preoau- / -tions ' and *exoept for reasons beyond his control* 1 have been added as the original wording goes too far. t ■■ ■' The aheikh oanno be expected to accept liabilities. ''7' S f /• 'ft?''/' i I ' ly*/ ' i —' / / such as no civilised State would accep^for the recovery of stolen property. He maintains a police force which with the help of the * trustworthy guards ' will do all that they can to safeguard the Company v s property and nothing more can be expected. 6.

In this connection X am to state that Major Holmes and iir. Sanson, one of the director® of the lantern and ueneral Syndicate, callad at the Colonial Office the l?th of 0&lt;fcto%er in regard to the extension for which they hare applied and explained that the first Geologist whom the Syndicate had sent out to Bahrein had reported unfawura^ly as to the prospect® of winning oil in commercially payable quantities, ^ince then 4 other Geologists had 'heen sent out and their reports, although conflicting, were, for themost part, very favoursvie. The Syndicate now wiehed to send out again the original Geologist in order to give him an opportunity of fconsidering hit unfavourable report, fhey were satisfied that in view of the Geological information now available he • ou id» if sent out ae,ain, report favourably. 3. The representatives of the Syndicate also stated that they were at present negotiating with American and Canadian u®4?s ary 0i? stats ■0aB ii41ftii lnt#r«8t» with a vim to finding sufficient capital to finance proapecting operations in Batorfin (if the final geological reports proved favourable) anfi ultimate coraEeroial development. In this they were baapered hyan agreemaat concluded between the mrioue interests participating in the Turkish fetroleum which ae^arred any one constituent group froat taking up a oono^seion within an area so defined «© as to include Bahrein, haoa etc., without previously offering that eon cession to the Turkish Petrol »um ^ owpany as a wbole. the American group with whom the syndicate were negotiating in regard to participation in Bahrein was a the Turkish Petroleum Company and consequently could not act independently of that Coapanyl It was therefore possible that the latter Company wight in fact acquired an interest in the Bahrein concession. On Veing asked whether it wae anticipated, if the present negotiations with the American group were successful, the preponderance of capital would American, Mr. .Sanson said that such would he the case. Eis own Syndicate had already ©scpended sone &lt;£6(1,000 on exploratory work in Bahrein and could not hmselves find the ®oney to finance prospecting and develo^raeaat. 'fhey had tried to obtain Snglish capital for the purpose without success and they had now to loofe to America. Mr. Janson admitted that, if the capital were preponderantly Ainerican, the real control would also pass into American hands, bj&amp;t that the Eastern and General Syndicate would presumably be kept alive in some form as the nominal concessionaires, iis did not conceal the fact, however, that the British Company would %e the raerest facade %thind. which the Ameri can group would pull timstrings, and that the concession would probably pass either into the virtual control of the Turkish ^•troleuo Company or into that of an American group of that Company. Mr# Sanson was reminded that unoer the terms of0 f the niniBS lease the concession oould not &gt;&gt;« conveyed fc0 third party without the conaent of the Sham acting' wider the advice of the Eesldent in the Feriean Gulf •no that Ms Majesty 1 a Government had ^een assured when the grant of the con cession to the Syndicate was first veing discussed that control would and would remain entirely British. Mr.Janson did not deny this ^ut he gaid that in practice and in view of the earlier unfavourable geological report a it had proved wholly &lt;*• impossible to raise the necessary capital in tMs country. Mr. Sanson added that vefore his negotiations with the Aaerioan group went further he would comcunlcate his financial proposals to hi® Majesty's Qovernweat officially and invite their concurrence. 4. This latter comaunication has not yet v ecn received from the Syndicate presuiia^-ly v ecause they are still hope Ail of obtaining British capital. Mr. Ass^ry 0$ proposes, however, subject to the concurrence of the Secre ta ry of State for 1 nJUa to inforsa ths Syndicate that if they are prepared t give an undertaking siollrir in form to the d aft ola.se referred t j in Colonial Office letter So,59191/28 of today*• date, on the sufeject of oil concession in Kerwa.it . thsfc tne Ucwpany a....ill Ht all Uses ht and rsaain a British O-wnany and to eahddy that un-4srtaxing in any Agreement which they may conclude »lth the Shaikh of Bahrein for the renew al of their sxnloratlon licence.

This period expired on 1st December 1927 but at the request of Major Holmes, Shaikh Hiamad acting on the advice of the Political Hesident extended it for another year. J In accordance with the terms of Article VI of the agreement the Eastern and General Syndicate paid the Bahrain State a sum of Rs 20,000 for the original exploration license, the Eastern BanJk^ahrain have paid the State a further sum of Rs 10,000 on 2nd December of this year^presumably in anticipation of Shaikh Hamadapproval of the grant of a further ox 'tension of their exploration license, although the •bject has not boon stated.k- In 1926 Pr«f€8««r mj&amp; vlsittd island, wHile during Ui« «urly m«ntii» •f 1928 Messrs.

It is the opinion •fthe British colony in Bahrain that they are wery efficient unofficial Consuls.
