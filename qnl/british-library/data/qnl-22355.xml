At present the Bahrain Islands consist of Manamah, Muharraq, Uta-Na r san- not inhabited, Sitrah and Nabi^g^ Salih. The Islands are situated on the east of the Arab peninsula and south west of the Gulf of Basrah at a distance of 30 kilometers from the coast(main-land)• The area is about 552 kilometers square. There are no high mountains and the highest place in the island is Jabal ad-Dakhan which is about 150 meters. Its coasts are low and the Island is surrounded by sand hills. The land is very fertile0 Oranges, lauz, ponj^ranates, grapes and figs are grown. The climate of the place is damp but trying. There are no rain falls.

There are 1150 sailing boats for the pearl fishery which is the most important source of income of the island./3 State Admin3tration&gt; J ■' » ^ Shaikh Hanja is the independent Ruler of Bahrain and is assisted by a minister who looks after the affairs Ox the state. He hast-two officialsj one in Manamah and one in Miharraq* The qadhi al Qiiihat(chief Qadhi) deals with the most important matters. Petty cases are tried in Muharraq by a Sunni Qadhi and in Manamah by a Shi 1 ah Qadhi. Besides these two there are seven other Qadhis. Cases relating to trade are referred to a special committee headed by the British Consul and is called the Lajlis al 'Urffi.

The fourth place is Hidd and is inhabited by 7,000. Fifthly, there are about 50 villages with a population which differs according to the importance of each of them. The Shaikhs of Bahrain- Al Khalifal^are Sunnis of p ' - - - • • , - - / Fallci sect and from a tribe called al 'Utubiyah. TheyPI became the Rule« of the country in the year 1783 A.C. The present Ruler is Shaikh Hamad bin f Isa al Khalifah who succeeded to the Shaikh-ship in the year 1923# The History of Bahrain# Before the prophet Muhammad Bahrain w as in the possession of the Persians. In the days of the prophet the tribe of 'Abdul Qais bin 'Afsah came from Tuhamah and tarned out the Persians and occupied the place. In the year 627 A.C. 'Ali bin •Abdullah al Hadhrami sent messengers to the Island to induce its Shaikh- Munjir Ibn 'Isawaih to embrace Islam. The island was tteen * • ■ — - - . - i- ^ inhabited by fire-worshippers, Jews and Christains. The mission was successful. After the death of the prophet, peace be on him, Thuraya bin Dhubyan revolted and the country remained in a state of disturbances till the year 1507 when it was occupied by the Portuges and it remained in their possession till the year 1622 when they were conquered by Shah ^bbas who included the same in the Persian dominions. It remained in his possession till the year 1712 when he was conquered by the Sultan of Oman. The Island was again recaptured by Nadir Shah in the year 1735 and remained under his influence till the year 1783 when the ^tubiyah family, from whom s the present Al Khalifah decend, occupied the same /1783/1800 1810. Bahrain enjpyed full independence without any interference from others from the year 1783 till the year 1800. In the year 1800 they were conquered by the Sultan of Mascat who declared the same under his protect ion . In the year 1801 Amir 'Abdul f Aziz of Najd occup ied the ^sland and in the year 1810 the: Utubiyah saved their country from all interference. For certain period they, however, paid tribute to Muscat, Persia and Najd. Bahrain paid the tribute to Najd until the year 1828 and to Najd until the year 1830. In the year 1839 the Egyptian army, which attacked the Wahhabis in Na.id, attemoted to occupy Bahrain but was stopped bythe Bntxsh just as they did with the Persians when they attempted to do the same thing in the year 1843. m the year 1847 England entered into treaty with the grand-son, Shaikh Muhammad, of the founder of the A1 Khalifah Principality for the suppression of slave traffic. Turkey objected to the same but no heed was paid to them by the British. This e4ep was the first step towards the recognition of Bahrain. It was then followed oy another treaty in the year 1856. In 1867 Persia again tried to occupy Bahrain but they were stopped by Britain. In order to put an end to the Powers activities and ^Itions they decided to enfier into a treaty with mi al Khalifah which they did on 21st March Iflei according to which Bahrain was Placed under the British Protection. Another treaty was entered into on 16th September 1868 following the attempt which the Persians made in the year 1867. Other TreatipR.

It would be interesting if the Shaikh could find out confidentially through Shaikh 1 Abdullah, who wrote the article in the Saut al Ahrar.

About a month and a half ago when f Ali bin iiusain and Shaikh f Abdullah vere in the ^eb^non an article appeared in a Beyrout newspaper under the signature of 'All bin Salim to the effect that Shaikh 'Abdullah and Shaikh ^uhanu ad were negotiating a treaty for ^5 years with ^reat Britain and that Shaikh Muharcmrd was going to ^ondon to sign it. uhaikh 'Abdullah had a denial published in the same paper the next day. From ell the information I have received there is no doubt at all that 'All bin iiusain was the author of this article. 2. I showed this article to His Excellency Shaikh ha mad and he agreed with me that the author was 'All bin Uusain, but I suggested t^at it would be better before deciding what should be done, if he discussed the matter with Shaikh 'Abdullah on his return. In the meantime it came to bj , notice that 'All bin Uusain was very heavily indebted in the town and was claiming that as a Government servant ne could not bo sued. Also one of the common immoralities of life in the last was biing pursued in his house to uch an extent that It hi d become a scandal. I was also informed that he had misappropriat ed the greater portion of 'Iraq Dinars 200. which the Kuni- clpality had given him for the purchase of certain articles in 1 Iraq. Dalrymple Selgrave Esquire, 6 Neville Terrace, Onslow Gardens, London S.V..2. 4« &gt;ou uiciy renkrinber a letter v -hich Ciiptain Prior v&lt;Totc to His Excellency shaikh Han ^d on the 9th November 1931 informing him of certain anti-British intrigues of 'All bin ] husaln and asking ills Ixcellency Shaikh iiamad to give him an Y&gt; exemplary warning* -his warning v-.as given by Lis Excellency V ohaikiri Hamau• i reminded rile Excellency shaikh hanad of this warning. 5. I discussed the matter with ^halkh «Abdullah and iihaikn kahaRiffiad and later with riis Excellency ^haikii ^amad and found all three of them very determined that f ..li bin Husain shculu be uismissed from hi a post as Secretary. Ironj enquiries in the town it was apparent that with the exception of the Kanoo, the Fakhroo and the Qusaibi families, he was deservedly disliked. It seamed to mc that if any exezr.plar/ punishment was to be given to him. It should be done quickly so that he should not have time to create any trouble. ii is Excellency 'haikn ^umad was very much of th&gt; same opinion and it was decided tn^t tne best course would be for him to be dismissed by the orders of tne shaikh and this was done. From what I have gathered his dismissal has been popular in the town and His Excellency tne Shaikh is very glad to be rid of him, both from personal and other reasons. 6. At present the Municipality have found that he owes % them over a thousand rupees and that tne goods he purchased in 'Iraq were not worth a quarter of the value stated by him. They are, therefore, calling for experts to value tnese goods and I think it is likely tnat they will decide to run a criminal case against him. 7. I was present at the m»:eting of the Baladiyah this morning when the decision to examine the goods was reached /and itand it was also decided that his Provident ^'iind s.uouid not be handed over till either he %as exonerated at the enrulry or acquitted at the trial. 8# Shaikh Muhammad I think at one time wished to have his son, bhaikh Khalifah, appointed Gecretary. Jhaikh f Abdu-lah suggested temporarily appointing the Secretary of the Muharraq l^unicipality and appointing Shaikh Khallfah temporarily as Secretary of the Muharraq iSunicipality. Certain M mbers of the Municipality wished to appoint Ahmad ^in Husain Ibrahim Kanoo. I do not think that he is a suitable person, 1 managed to have these suggestions shelved and I told Shaikh Muhammad that it would be best if the appointment of a Secretary were left till your arrival. He was not willing to give that reason to the Baladiyah because he thought taat It might lead Members to think that you would reinstate him, so the Baladiyah have decided not to act hastily but to look out for a really suitable man. 9. As far as I know there Is no inkling in the town or in the Baladiyah that the *ig e mcy has played any part in the dismissal of 'Ali bin Lusain. 10. In the normal course I should have written to you In the first place but it appeared desire ble that act J on should be taken quickly and His Ixcellency the 0 haikh was so determined, with his two brothers in agreement, on the dis missal of ? Ali bin liusain that I did not suggest postponment. I talked over the whole matter with de ^renier and I maj say- that he entirely agrees with what has been done. There has been no agitation of any importance. !!• I do not think that there will be time to let you know by this mail as to whether or not there will be a case against him, but I will write by the next mail.

Worth Esquire,I.C.S., Political Agent, Bahrain. cFrom the Ad, to th Bahrain Gov No. C, 134/35 Bahrain. Persian Gulf. 20th February 1935. Dear Colonel Loch, Last summer Ali bin xlussein Khalfan, for several years the Secretary of the Ivianama Municipal Council, was tried by Shaikh Sulman in the Bahrain Court on a charge of misappropriating municipal funds and sentenced to six months hard labour. I understand that he was ^given no opportunity of producing evidence in the way of documents or receipts from Basrah where the goods for which he was given the money were purchased. He returned from Baghdad to Bahrain by air, direct, and proceedings were instituted against him at once, the first matter was the question of a newspaper article v/hich he was said to have written in Syria then he was charged with misappropriation. 2* He has now completed his sentence and has applied to the Bahrain Government for permission to go to Basrah in order to get the remainder of the goods which he says he bought and paid for and to get the receipts for other goods which he bought. lorwarded his application to Shaikh Hamed and received a reply from Shaikh Hamed informing me that the judgment which was inflicted on Ali bin Hussein was on the advice of the Political Agent and not from Shaikh Hamed himself therefore he tells me to ascertain whether you have any objection to the man going to Basrah in which case Shaikh Hamed will allow him to go. A copy of all that was recorded in this case was forwarded to you in my letter No. C. 129 of 28/1/35.— . 5. I think myself that this case was handled in an unfortunate manner, Shaikh Sulman was well knov/n to be on very bad terms with Ali bin Hussein, on account of the slaughter house matter. During the hearing, which took five minutes, Kozaibi and Abdel Rahman Zayani were present and when they made some suggestion to Shaikh Sulman he told ^ them that the whole case was being brought by the order of the Agency and that the 11 Hukm ' was from the Agency. 6. The man has served his sentence and he made no appeal, a new Secretary has been appointed to the Biladya and therefore I think no harm would come of allowing him to go to Basrah. Yours sincerely.

I feel, however, that must drrin, ?'ttent on to lis Excellency Shaikh Sir Hamad's view ttu t n t was on the cdv ce of the * llt'.cal Agent' that the judgment was Ocide and - lalkh Sri ;n f s statement thet the case brought 'by order of the Agency'. I fear that there mu^t be some mLsappreheas 'on, possibly due to the fact that the Acting Political A^ent sew aha Kh Salman on the subject, ills Excellency himself v^rote a letter dated the Ist August VMA th Kab: 1 al Than- ^353) to Sha ^h kuhammad b n »Isi A1 Kh llfah dlrcharging »/I b!n Husa.n and the Act ng r olit cai Agent Informed re th't, when he visited Sha.kh Salman at Jasrah, he esked him to return next day to hear a cese wh ch was be ng brought by the B &amp;lad -iyah t inst 'Ali b.n iusaln for rlsa^ rop- riatlon, but that it was Incorrect to state that the case was being brought by the order of the Agency. 4. I think that it was unfortunate that the /ctlng Political Agent took the unusual step of himself going to see Dhaka Salman in the matter, but I also fe^l that It was unfortunate that the case was deaxt wHh in, so far as I can judge from the mformcLtion before me, in so sum i ry a fesh on. t C» talrymple ael^rave ^squire.
