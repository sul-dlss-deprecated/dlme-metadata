Also discussed is the likelihood that if Russia takes possession of Herat they will then be able to flank the Indian empire on the right by Kokund, on the left by Beloochistan and in the centre via Candahar.The letter concludes by commenting on Pelly's letters in the
                           Daily News, and general opinions of the running of both England and India.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024079755.0x00001b#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
