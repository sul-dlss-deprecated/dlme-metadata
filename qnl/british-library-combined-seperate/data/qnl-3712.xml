The first half of the file, covering the period November 1940 to January 1941, relates to a request to the Bahrain Political Agent, from British Overseas Airways Corporation’s (BOAC) Station Superintendent in Bahrain (f 2), to use shortwave radio communication to communicate with aircraft. The second half of the file, covering the period December 1943 to January 1944, relates to a request to the Bahrain Political Agent from BOAC’s Station Superintendent in Bahrain (M J C Auster, f 13), to use low power radio signals at Bahrain to communicate with flying boats flying at night. Both requests required official sanction from the Political Agency, in liaison with naval representatives, air liaison officers, and Bahrain-based representatives of Cable and Wireless Limited. Two final items in the file (ff 23 and 24) concern the tour of a Signals Mission to the Gulf and wider region, to examine and assess radio equipment on the RAF Transport Command and Empire Air Routes.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Overseas Airways Corporation</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Cable and Wireless Ltd</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>RAF Transport Command</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Radio</topic></subject><subject><topic>Aerial navigation</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000336#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000336#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000336#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
