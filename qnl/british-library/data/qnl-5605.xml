Saudi began by asking whether Iraqi Minister at Tehran had cor rectly described intention of Iraqi Grovernment when he informed Per sian Government that they would only negotiate Shatt-el-iirab conven tion on condition that Great Britain was invited to take part in ■ negotiations and to sign instrument when concluded. basin Pasha, replied that in view of volume of British shipping using Shatt-el-Arab and in consideration of their alliance with Great Britain Iraqi Government had committed themselves to inclusion of his (sic Mlis Majesty’s) Government in any agreement about Shatt-el-Arab. Samii then produced a telegram from Kazemi which contained accoun of his discussion with you at Geneva similar to that reported in Tehran telegram No. 592. He suggested that as you had agreed to Hazemi* s proposals there was no longer any reason for Iraqi Government to invite His Majesty*s Government to be party to proposed convention. Yasin Pasha replied that Iraqi Government would not alter their decision unless they'were informed by His Majesty*s Government that . they (His Majesty*s Government) did not wish to participate. Samii then read from Kazemi* s telegram strong advice to Iraqi Government not to betray Iraqi interests into British hands by allow ing His Majesty's Government an equal footing with riparian govern ments in control of Shatt-el-Arab. This point was rubbed in by Samii and provoked an outburst from Yasin Pasha who asked Samii whether he thought Iraqi Government were such fools as to prefer to share control ox... ©.2 . oi Shot g el~/,rab with hersian^ v/hn + i ° vmo Vcint eo. uo take some of their territory froo them tlvm V nfa .

'Tne Iraqi minister called yesterday afternoon and expressed th following views in the course of a private conversation. s. nazeini T s Indecision regarding British participation in Con servancy Board was largely due to his impression that Yasin Pasha was equally undecided. It was therefore necessary first to bring Yasin Pasha to the point. He then expressed a purely personal view that this could be done if somewhat strong pressure were brought to bear on (? Yasin Pasha). After all, he said, Iraq owed much to Great Britain and was entirely dependent on her. If His Majesty 1 s Government exer cised authority on Yasin Pasha he could not resist. 5. i/Iy Iraqi colleague did not wish to be saddled with the responsibility of having expressed these views, but as he had already expressed them somewhat emphatically some days ago to Mr. Mallet it is clear that he holds them with conviction. He seemed anxious that they should be passed on very privately and con fidentially. 4. As to the possibility of the Iraqi-Iran agreement he said that in the view of his government there were three points which should stand together, Treaty friendship, Conservancy Convention and Bon-aggression Pact. The Iraqi Government would not wish to conclude the latter until their outstanding difficulties with Persia had been settled. Kazemi on the other hand attached great importance to the Pact. Pressure might therefore be exercised2 . on the Persian Government by Iraqi refusal to sign the race until the other two matters had been disposed 01 t&gt;. Me also told me that he heard that Kazemi had written to Geneva proposing that the signatories of the Pact should have a single semi-permanent seat on wie Council of the ^ec^ue. He had done so without previously consulting narkey, Iraq or Afghanistan. Turkey had since objected as her European connexions necessitated independent representation at Geneva.

I called on Minister for Foreign Affairs today to enquire actual position of Shatt-el~Arab negotiations. I said that I understood Persian delegation at Bagdad had received instructions to agree to invitation to His Majesty’s Government to participate in negotiations for Conservancy Bo ard. 2. Minister for Foreign Affairs said Samii had been informed that Persian Government had no objection to participation of His Majesty’s Government in negotiations. I said I presumed this also meant signature of convention. Minister for Foreign Affairs sold, No. It was impossible for His Majesty’s Government to sign convention which on had been agreed by you in conversation with him at Geneva would only form one of several annexes to treaty of friend ship between Persia and Iraq. When I contested this- point of view Minister for Foreign Affairs went on to say that he had discussed with you at Geneva a draft which he had himself drawn up whereby convention should be signed by Persia and Iraq and a- third member should sit on commission. Persian Government agreed that this member should be British. 3. I said this was not at all my understanding of the position nor had I any information that- you had agreed to negotiations on this basis. On the other hand I knew that the ...■V 2, the views of His Majesty's Government were that negotiations should take place on ’oasis of draft tripartite convention, 1935 edition of which was in their possession. 4. Minister for Foreign Affairs said that he had never seen this draft and they had not got it. I replied that Mr. Mallet had given it to Hour! Esfandiary and Sir A. Clark Kerr to Sarnii. His Excellency then said he would look further into the matter. Judging from his tone during this conversation I fully expect he will express strongest objections to 1935 dr,aft and to signature by His Majesty's Government. He asked Why His Majesty's Government should sign this. I replied that our interests in naviga tion of Shatt-ei-Arab justified it and that it would be of advantage to both parties to have a third member friendly to both sides who could assist in cases of differences of opinion. 5. In view of his attitude I felt it quite impossible to press further for his agreement to signature by us without further instructions from you. 6.

He told me the proposition put to the Persian Government by him had been that His Majesty’s Government should be invited to participate in negotiations; there had been no specific mention of signature though he suggested to me that this would be understood. M. Soheily had been reluctant at first to agree,but since Kazemi’s return instructions have been sent to Bamii that he can agree to British participation in the negotiations. These instructions are almost certainly those in undecipherable telegram referred to in paragraph 4 oi Sir A. Clark Kerr’s telegram under reference. 3. it would be of use to know whether these instructions have actually reached. Samii and in what form. My Iraqi colleague is convinced that they are as described above, 4. In these circumstances I will await your instructions before acting in the sense of last paragraph of Sir A. Clark Kerr’s telegram though I will take an early opportunity of enquiring of Minister for Foreign .affairs or Soheily what their account of the present position is. 5. My Iraqi colleague also stated that Kazemi had mentioned ...3„ mentioned to him his preference for arreting that British participation in convention should only he for a limited uirO.e, say 'two or u'hrep , ue „eors. xhe object would he to give Persia a, lever with us thrown the Pewi -i po«er to block further continuation of British particioa- tion^or even co oecure the inclusion of some other Power. 1 M «•«» Government hen expressed objection to this idea, Which Indeed seems scarcely practicable, apart from other considerations» Addressed to Foreirn OffifP sqt.

Perso-Iraqi frontier dispute) and your telegram No. 182 (of December 9th). I agree with Mr® Mallet's suggestions. I do not under stand why Iraqi Ciovernment should have troubled Shah about length of anchorage, unless as a move in a bazaar bargain. 2. If anchorage is granted main interests which should be safeguarded are: (a) right of warships of Iraq and her allies to pass betw r een Basra and open sea in all circumstances of peace and war. (b) unified control of conservancy and navigation. 3. (a) will be assured if anchorage is limited to 100 yards in width (see Admiralty letters in my despatches Nos. 501 (of July 25th) and 704 (of October 17th), which also show that while anchorage should not extend north of Murgaba Jetty its southern limit is of small importance). If at any stage satisfactory agreement is in sight on every point except width of anchorage you should report by telegraph. 4. (b) vail be secured by proposed Conservancy Convention and I assume Iraqi Government will not cede anchorage unless Convention of at least 50 years’ validity Is previously concluded, 5. If anchorage were only l eased for duration of Conservancy Convention and this Convention were given unlimited duration, anchorage would theoretically be perpetual, but would revert to Iraq if Convention for any reason ended. This would he satisfactory arrangement for Iraqi Government, and lease2 . lease could carry with it full sovereignty while it lasted it might nossibly be acceptable to lersian Government. o. Persian suggestion in paragraph 6 of Mr. Mallet's 1^ctwi of rorember 28fch to Mr. i.endel is worth examination. Provided sovereignty remained with Iraq, Conservancy r Convention were concluded and rights of jurisdiction to be given to Persia were specified (e.g. police, customs. * etc.) area in which they were exercised could probably be made fairly extensive. addressed to Bagdad Bo. 15 Saving, repeated to Tehran No. 4 Saving.cy reply to this letter should be addressed to— THE SECRETARY, Board of Trade, Great George Street, Westminster, S.W.l, md the following reference number quoted:— r i&gt; r / q o ■?, - vl/ v-' ) BOARD OF TRADE, Great George Street Westminster, S.W.l M.12254/55. | Q rr ? 2 5rd December, 1955. c. 1 ' The Board of Trade present their compliments to the Secretary of State for India in Council, and beg to transmit herewith for information copy of a letter of to-day’s date which they have caused to be addressed to The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office, S.W.l.

As a result of conversations about the form of invitation to His Majesty's Government to be a party to convention Nuri Pasha sent me on the 17th draft of joint letter to be signed by Samii and himself. Letter confined itself to an invitation to participate in negotiations and made no reference to His Majesty's Government being a signatory. I pointed out omission and Nuri Pasha told me,that itboas deliberate and had been made (--group -undec: ) Prime Minister in case* he suggested that I should take the matter up. I saw the Prime Minister this morning and he explained that although the Iraqi Government still desired that His Majesty’s Government should be a signatory, he had thought it better tactics to try to bring Persians into line by degrees P He was most anxious not to do anything that might frighten them off at the beginning and he thought that if he were at this stage to ask them to agree to join in an invitation to His Majesty’s Government to be a party to convention he would create the impression that Iraq and Great Britain were enter ing into negotiations combined against Persia. Moreover he understood that Persian delegate had not yet clear instructions even about our participation (this was confirmed2. confirmed to me yesterday l)y Samii who said that he had indeed just received an undecypherable telegram which might contain instructions hut he could not say. He added that his delegation had not even brought with them a copy of 1955 text. I gave him one). I did my best to allay the Prime Minister's fears and said that it seemed to me that better tactics would, be to make it clear to Persians from the beginning that we (? group omitted) to sign but I was not successful. Finally he agreed to include omitted reference in joint letter if Persian delegation received clear instructions from Tehran to join Iraqi Govern ment in making invitation in the form desired.

Article 18a. Any claim against the board for civil damages shall (unless some other procedure is agreed upon between the board and the claimant or claimants) be determined by an independent arbitrator.

Reference to previous correspondence (if any):—COPY. ( T) rr Mercantile Marine Department, ) n Board of Trade, v v .. 1 k.) \ j Great George Street, Westminster, r D S.Vif, lo December, 1935 ♦ Oct ' M. 12234/35 0 IMPQRTAilT . Sir, With reference to your letter of the 23rd October (No .£*6159/112/34) on the subject of the proposed Shatt-el-Arab Conservancy Board Convention, I am directed by the Board of Trade to state, for the information of Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare, that they have given careful consideration to the matter. The Board agree with the Secretary of State that it is desirable to retain the provisions in the Draft Convention requiring a unanimous vote of the proposed Board to determine certain matters* The decisions to be taken under these provisions will largely affect shipping, which is predominantly under the British flag, and it would be undesirable for the British member of the Board to be liable to be out-voted by his colleagues on any matter affecting the interests of shipping. If in the course of the negotiations it becomes necessary to consider whether The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, S.W. 1* /thethe requirement of a unanimous vote can be dispensed with in some respects, any such proposal could be examined on its merit In the following paragraphs the Board propose to comment on the suggestions made in the Memorandum enclosed with your letter for the modification of the Draft Convention and at the same time to take the opportunity of themselves proposing certain amendments suggested by their reperusal of the draft with a view to improving the text. The references to the draft in the following paragraphs relate to the text as agreed at August, 1935, a copy of which was enclosed with your letter, except where otherwise specified. Article 2 , The Board have been unable to identify the position of the boundary mark called 'Pillar Ko. 1'. The Board consider that the reference to this mark should be made more explicit but the matter could no doubt be left to be cleared up on the spot with the assistance of the technical advice available, and the completion of the draft need hardly be delayed for a precise form of wording on this point. The Board concur in the amendments in lines 22 and 28 respectively suggested in Mr. Baggallay s Memorandum, /SomeSome further minor drafting amendments are suggested in the first enclosure to this letter. Article 5 . The Board have no ohservations to offer on the proposal to amend Article 3, or on the terns of that Article as redrafted in Annex 2 of Mr. Baggallay^s Memorandum. Article a . With regard to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company’s suggestion to include among the functions of the Conservancy Board the maintenance of rr herths of the requisite depths of water at all jetties, quays and wharves', the Board understand that Harbour Authorities in the United Kingdom do not usually undertake the dredging of berths alongside jetties, quays and wharves except in the capacity of agents of the owners of the structure, and at the expense of the latter. If the Company’s suggestion was adopted the/Board might find themselves liable for oamage to the structure of the quays etc., (if for example the foundations had not been carried deep enough) or to vessels using the berths in case of grounding. Moreover, it seems unreasonable that the Conservancy Board should be underan cfbligation to dredge a 'berth alongside every privateV^L^ jetty that may he constructed in the river. The Board consider that the normal practice should he followed in this instance, and that the maintenance of berths of the requisite depth should continue to he the responsibility of the owner of the wharf Jetty or quay, in whose interest it is to provide the necessary facilities, unless there are any strong practical grounds to the contrary in the circumstances of this waterway. Subject to any further observations which the Petroleum Department or the Company may desire to offer on this aspect of the matter the Board suggest the aeletion of lines 13 and 14 of this Article as redrafted in Annex 3 to the Memorandum. The Conservancy Board would not, of course, be precluded by the omission of this provision from performing the dredging operations as the agents of the owners of the structures. Certain minor verbal amendments to the Article as redrafted t&gt;y Mr. Baggallay are suggested for consideration in thej/attaches to this letter. With regard to the proposal to insert a reference to the International Sanitary Convention, the Secretary of State may wish to consult the Ministry of Health. The Board for their part have no objections. /SubjectSubject to these comments the Board concur in Mr. Baggallay’s redraft of Article 4. Article 5 . The Board have no comments to offer upon the vie w expressed in Mr. Baggallay’s Memorandum. Article 6 (a) . In addition to the amendment in line 1 proposed in the Memorandum, with which the Board agree, it would seem also desirable to strike out the word 'Navigation' at the beginning of line 5. In so far as the dues are for services rendered to shipping, it is desirable that they should be levied only by reference to the ships themselves, though it is sometimes the practice to reduce the amount of such dues in respect of ships in ballast (e.g. in the Sues Canal). The Board presume that the possibility of a reduction of this nature is envisaged by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, but if the ■ desirable to add at the end, after 'transported', some such words as 'or be such as to render necessary a detailed examination of cargo, except in cases of Article 18 of the Convention relating to the Danube, 1921, quantity' are deleted from lines 6 and 7, suspected fraud or infringement of regulations’ (o.p. /andand Article 7 the Regime of of the Statute annexed Navigable Waterways of to the Convention on International Concern., 1921). Article 6 (b ) . The Board desire to suggest certain amendments to this proposal in order to bring the provisions into general conformity with the provisions of similar purport adopted in Commercial Treaties. For convenience a redraft of the paragraph is appended as the general enclosure to this letter. Article 6(c ) . The Board agree that there is some ambiguity in the phrase ’’engaged in river navigation”, and note the wish of the Anglo-Irarian Oil Company to include vessels engaged in lightering among the vessels qualifying for special consideration in respect of dues. The Board doubt, however, whether the insertion of the word ”normally” would clarify the meaning in the sense intended. They would suggest for consideration that the paragraph should be reworded as follows ”6 (c ) Nothing in the preceding paragraph shall be deemed to prejudice the power of the Board to make special arrangements in respect of vessels or classes of vessels navigating only within the seaward limits mentioned in Article 2, or engaged in / lighter ingFirst Enclosure additional drafting amendments by board of trade to the draft S HATT - EL- ARAB CONSERVANCY BOARD CONVENT ION» Article 2« Lines 2 and 8 » Insert !, nautical ,, or ”British Statute w before 'miles up stream'• Lines 6 and 12 ♦ Insert 'seaward' before 'approaches to the river' and omit 'on the seaward side'.

TREASURY chambers, WHITEHALL, S.W.l. 27th November, 1935. Dear Helm, We have been looking at the papers enclosed with your communication of the 25th October (E 6159/112/34} about the Shat t—el—Arab Conservancy Board Convent ion*. While we accept the view expressed in paragraph 6 of the letters of the 23rd October, we hope that it will be possible to retain the requirement of unanimity in the Articles dealing with financial administration. It is unnecessary to enlarge upon the various -undesirable things that might happen if the Iranian and Iraqi representatives could out vote the British representative. I find, for example, that we regarded the unanimity required by Article 8 as safe guarding the reserves against improper investment. If we are now to consider amendments in the draft, it may be well to consider whether the figure of £142,500 provided in Article 20 is still appropriate. I find that this figure (or rather its rupee equivalent, was decided upon at the beginning of 1932. At the end of 1931-32, the outstanding debt of the Port of Basra was £378,612. It is now (31.3.35) £324,524. (Both figures from the Administration reports and not checked against our records;. It is not very clear from our papers how the figure of 19 lakhs (£142,500) is arrived at, but it rather looks/ K. Helm, Esq., C.B.E., Foreign Office..looks as if the debt to he taken over should he reduced proportionately as the total debt of the Port declines, Prima facie, one would prefer to rely for repayment on the Port of Basra, under Colonel Ward ! s administration, rather than on the Conservancy Board, whose Iraqi and Iranian memhers may he difficult. This suggests that, if it would he appropriate to scale down the debt transferred to the Conservancy Board to correspond with the reduction of the total debt of the Port of Basra, we should propose it. It would however he best to hear what Colonel Ward thinks of this before reaching a decision. Yours sincerely, (Sgd,.) E.

At present the Bahaanshir is not navigable and although suggestions have been made at various times that the Persians might wish to make it so, as it lies entirely in their territory and 'would provide an alternative access to Abadan, it would in My Lords opinion be undesirable to give the Persians a lever to force the Board to spend money on making this river navigable, unless this is incidental to some larger operation such as the diversion of the Karan is order to avoid the deposition of silt in the Sh&amp;tt.

Printed copies of the report will be transmitted to you when they are available. 2. The main financial details of the year’s workings are summarised m this and subsequent paragraphs. Port of Basra— Revenue Operating expenditure Depreciation of new assets charged against revenue Twelfth instalment of capital debt and interest charges Revenue surplus Profit on power house 3 . The actual revenue surplus of ID. 34,480 was considerably in excess of the estimated surplus of ID. 2,310. The difference was due in part to the difficulty in arriving at an estimate in view of the reductions in port dues and the uncertainty as to the maintenance of traffic on the completion of the Iraq Petroleum Company pipe-line shipments. In the event, tonnages proved to be higher than in the previous year, and the rise in exports was particularly encouraging to the port authorities. The amount of tanker shipping entering the limits of the port was well maintained. n p 4. The reserves, which together total ID. 358,384, consist largely ot new capital works which account for ID. 220,049. Nevertheless, the financial position of the port continues to be very strong, and there is every reason to believe that the long chain of substantial revenue surpluses will continue unbroken toi some years to come. . , 5 . The following summary of the reserve account as it stood on the 31st March, 1934, and the 31st March, 1935, illustrates clearly the financia position of the port:— General reserve Surplus revenue reserve Central power station surplus revenue reserve Total reserves Cash- On deposit On hand ... Net amount due to port on current accounts Stores Expended on capital works ... Total The nature of the capital works at present in hand, for which, in the absence of budgetary provision, formal sanction was recently given by Royal decree, was explained in Sir Archibald Clark Kerr’s despatch No. 177 of the 2 nd April. 1 e [481 t—2] 1934.

Draft Shatt-el-Arab Conservancy Board Convention Copy of to is \ v/V Previ ous papers :- FOR INFORMATION. It will te remembered that the object x . of the draft Conservancy Boa.rd Convention is to satisfy Persian aspirations in the Shatt-el- Arab by giving Persia a share in the control of the waterway through representation on the L*rTTUj(!fC tripartite Board which wi Id be set up by the Convention. The Board would consist of Iraqi, Persian and British representatives, and it is hoped that the British representative would have sufficient influence to protect the interests of British shipping in the Shatt which amounts to 80 to 90 per cent of the total tonnage, and to enable H.M.G. to carry out their responsibilities under the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of Alliance (the control of the Shatt being ~tcr cr l necessary ■£e&gt;g H.M.G. for the^ supplies z-cAthe 3330 1000 12.34OX C4.S4- R.A.F. in Iraq in of serious emergency or war the transport of troops and munitions). Until recently the question of concluding the Convention has been more or less dormant since 1932 when there seemed to be some hope of the Persians accepting the Conservancy Board scheme and when a copy of the draft Convention was handed to the Persian Minister of Court. It is now quite possible, however, that the Conservancy Board scheme m.a,y a,fter all materialise as part of a solution of the present Perso-Iraqi frontier dispute, since there is again a possibility that the Persians may be willing to renounce their claim to sovereignty over half the waters of the Shatt (subject to their obtaining a Persian anchorage off Abadan) in return for a sh^re in the control of navigation such as would be given them by the draft Convention. It is proposed that when Huri Pasha goes to Tehran in the near future to negotiate with the Persians in regard to the frontier dispute, he should oJjkr again offer them a solution of the presnnt on the lines of the draft Convention, end it is probable that he will take with him to Tehran a copy of the draft in its latest form for presentation to the Persian Government. Several minor amendments have been made in the draft Convention since the Persians received a copy in 1932, and an important amendment has also been suggested in Article 2 with a view to giving the Board control of the whole of the Bahmanshir Channel which is of course a Persian waterway. The reasons for this amendment are indicated in the record of the conversation between Mr.Bendel and Nuri Pasha at P.Z.4608/35 (the latest paper on the file) but it is doubtful whether the Persians could be persuaded to accept it. J. With regard to Article 4 of the draft Convention which provides for the running of the Persian Gulf lighting service by the Board at the request of the authority or authorities at present responsible for this service, the position has been slightly altered by the fact that H.M.G. have recently r eeMinute Paper. Department to hand over to Persia the lights and buoys situated in Persian territory or territorial waters. The relevant clause in Article 4 is however merely permissive and it is perhaps improbable that the Persians would agree to the running of the Persian lights by the Board. In that case it would presumably be quite easy to arrange for the lights and buoys on the Arab side of the Gulf to be run by the British representative on the Conservancy Board^ instead of as at present by the Director of the port of Basra^on behalf of the Government of India, who are of course responsible for their upkeep. A. A copy of the draft Convention which is up to date except for a minor amendment in Article 20 and for the proposed amendment of Article 2 in regard to the Bahmanshir mentioned above will be found at P.Z.83/35. - ' 7/ ir |1 TL /mU A** f- ;S '- / ' SL &gt;‘ ^ fa ** * f/fa ^ I! . “ ‘± 4 -wl i ' li Am rnz ^ J * /-' tL ^ . .‘r ^ l,ll m IXi* m Mom ^ — r h'^1 r T ^kiitwkto* /A tt. • .Jt ....

Your telegrams Nos. 185 to 187 and 191 (of July Eott and July 29tli: Perso-Iraqi frontier dispute). Definite acceptance of British participation in Conservancy Board hy Iraqi government is most satisfactory. 2. His majesty ? 3 Government entirely agree with Nuri Pasha that customs and smuggling should he dealt with in a separate agreement. 3. With regard to quarantine, articles 4 and 5 of draft Conservancy Convention give Board power to deal with sanitary questions. His iHajest37- ? s Government do not know what points separate agreement about quarantine is intended to cover, and without fuller informaoion would not wish to suggest that no such agreement should oe made. But they would urge that in technical discussions great care should he taken to avoid any duplication of authoiity and any encroachment on powers v/hich Board will need wi oh in its own jurisdiction 4. For your own confidential information, principal ohjection to bilateral convention is lack of security as regards duration. His majesty’s Government might be oi ven same vote and therefore same powers as two signatories, but if latter agreed to terminate convention before expiry t of its full term or to vary it so as to exclude His Majesty’sMajesty's Government from the Board, His Majesty's Government would have no legal ground for objection. Even if one signatory denounced it illegally, His Majesty's Government would have no locus standi for supporting other signatory. These dangers could be partially surmounted if one of signatories gave His Majesty's Government separate assurances against premature denun ciation or variation. But such assurances would be difficult to publish and unless published would have little value. If, on the other hand, both signatories were willing to give them they would presumably be willing to accept His Majesty's Government as signatory. 5. His Majesty’s Government are therefore definitely averse to idea of a bilateral convention.

Nuri told me today that he thought that provided that Persian Government recognised 1914 frontier he could now assure me that the Prime Minister accepted in principle the tripartite Conservancy Board with Great Bricain as third party. He added however that no formal Cabinet decision had as yet been taken. He was now seeking the best means of overcoming opposition which he foresaw on the part of the Persians and following possible courses of action had suggested themselves to him - 1. that he should try to secure Persian acceptance of the main provisions of Conservancy Board and when this was achieved he should pro pose to the Persians that His Majesty's Government should par ticipate in subseouent negotiation of text and in due course as a-signatory. He said it would fortify his proposal for British participation if at a time to be agreed between him and His Majesty's Minister at Tehran, Fir. Hugessen were authorised to remind Persian Government of important Britisn shipping interests in the Shatt-el-Arab and to urge upon them advantages of accepting Iraqi Government's offer of Conservancy Board. 2. That in the event of sustained Persian resistance to tripartite convention he thought that rather than allow arrange ments to break down Iraqi Government might propose to Persia conclusion of a bipartite convention providing specifically for representative of bis Majesty's Government on n a k?aid of thxee.

But , in view of the fact that it was Els Majesty's Minister and not the Irani representative at Tehran who in the first place communicated a text of the draft to the Iranian Government, I consider that there would be advantage in your endeavouring to fix the method of eventual approach to the am.an Government by discussion with Nuri Pasha in London i.e. provided you concur in the procedure outlined above* 6.

If the Board had no authority over the Bahmanshir as a whole ? there would be no guarantee that such dangers, or any other possible complications of a similar nature, could be prevented or remedied; but if the whole of the Bahmanshir fell within the Jurisdiction of the Board, it could from the outset talc© any necessary steps to guard against them, e,g* by dredging the channel or strengthening the banks wherever this might be required. 3® We appreciate that if the Iraqi Government accept the proposed amendment, the greatest care will be required in bringing it to the notice of the Persian Government if there is to be any hope of its acceptance by that Government,, But if the details of the Conservancy Convention are liscussed during your forthcoming visit to Tehran, we would suggest that the above amendment might be put forward, in *Q sense as a fait accompli but as a basis of discussion, hith the sol© purpose of securing a more efficient practical and technical control of the Sha11-eX~Arab * Believe me, Yours sincerely, (Signed) QoWl KexideX*Boat Channels, separating MuhaXla Island from Abadan Island; and 60 .yards up all oranoh waterways of the main streams mentioned* shall he placed under the control and administrative authority of a conservancy hoard* to the or at any port which may in future he formed on these waterways; except that the hoard shall have power to make and enforce regulations regarding vessels so moored or made fast* for the purpose of securing the safety of life and property afloat ? and of preventing the risk of damageo The hoard shall have power to issue regulations governing construction of all fatties quays or wharves § which* by projecting into the waterway* could in any way interfere with navigation 0con* (E 3941/112/34 ) NO DISTRIBUTION * iTn ■ —nw»—— Decode e Sir A* Clark Kerr (Bagdad) 26th June 1936.

The A.P.O.C. are anxious that the Iraqi Government should not be informed that the Dredging Agreement is, in fact, practically a dead letter, and it appears that they are afraid that the deletion of the whole of paragraph (ii) of Article 20 of the draft Convention might give them this impression. In view of this, while they think that the Company^ apprehensions are based on a misunderstanding, the Foreign Office now propose to amend Article 20 again so as to retain the second sentence of paragraph (ii) ^Ith ougi/j deleting the first sentence as before^ V T fehey consider that if the Iraqi Government/2 Government should tua- to the reference to the Dredging 1 Agreement it would not be practicahle to contest the matter.

It will be seen from the petroleum Departments letter that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company are anxious that the Iraq[i Government should not be informed that the Fao Bar Dredging Agreement of 19£5 which forms the subject of the second part of Article £0, as at present drafted, is practially a dead letter. Their apprehensions on this score are evidently based on a misunderstanding, for the acceptance of cir Francis Humphrys 1 proposal that Article £0 should be so amended as to omit all mention of the Agreement does not imply that His Majesty f s Government need express any such opinion. *The validity of the Agreement is one that concerns the Ira(ii Government and the company, and if it is otherwise valid it cannot be invalidated by the fact that no mention is made of it in an instrument concluded between the Iraqi Government and third parties. Such an instrument might, of course, place obligations upon the Iraqi Government which would be incompatible with the obligations it had/ r ^ n ^ e r-Secretary of State , India Office. (.15 COPY SENT B’^AIR MAIL 7/y jr — —■10 liad already undertaken to the company under tke Agreement, but it would be primarily for the Iraq.! Government to satisfy itself, before it entered into the new commitment, that this was not the case. 3 # Mow that the provisions of the Agreement respecting the debt due from the Iraqi Government to the company have been automatically cancelled by the repayment of the debt, the main obligations imposed by the Agreement on the Iraqi Government are: (1) to carry on continously the dredging of the Shatt-el-Arab so as to provide a channel of a specified width and depth (2) to give effect in doing so to a report drawn up by a certain consulting engineer in June 1923 (3) to discontinue- the dredging operations, if, but only if, an arbitrator finds this to be 'just and convenient” (4) to render periodical statements of accounts. The benefits extended to the Iraqi Government in return appear to consist of no more than the right to receive three months 1 credit on all oil supplied to them by the company. 4. It is quite conceivable that if a reference to the Agreement were retained in the draft of the Convention and if this draft were ever to become the subject of negotiation, the Iraqi or the Persian Government, or both of them, might express the opinion that although the Board would in practice naturally carry out the spirit of the obligations imposed upon Iraq by the Agreement there was no reason why it should enter into a commitment towards a private conpany to carry out the letter of these obligations. Such an objection would, in Sir John Simon’s opinion, be too reasonable for His Majesty’s Government to be able, to resist it. b, in these circumstances Sir John Simon proposes, if Sir Samuel Hoare agrees, to suggest to the Iraqi Government that Article 20 should be amended, not in the manner originally suggested in this Department’s letter E 6956/38/34 of End January, 1935,/1935 , but in the laanner following, tliat is to say; tiie arrangement of Article EO(i) would remain unaltered, but Article 20( ii) would read as follows; 'fixe obligations undertaken by and the benefits 'pertaining to the Iraqi Government under the Dredging 'Agreement, dated the 19th day of March, 1925, concluded 'between the Iraqi Government and the Anglo-Persian Oil 'Company shall be transferred to the Board,' on the understanding that if either the Iraqi Government, when this suggestion is made to them, or the Persian Government, at some later stage, should object to the retention of a reference to the Agreement in the Convention, His Majesty^ Government will have no option but to drop this reference altogether. 6. Sir John Simon would be glad if he might receive a reply to this letter at an early date in view of the fact that, in certain circumstances, the draft Conservancy Board Convention may come under discussion with the Iraqi and Persian delegations at Geneva during the forthcoming session of the Council of the League of Nations, in connexion with the Perso-Iraqi frontier dispute. 7.

In regard to this matter, this Department was asked semi-officially by the Treasury to confirm with the Anglo- Persian Oil Company that the Company had in fact been paid. This was done and at the same time the Company were told unofficially of the proposed amendment. While admitting that the Agreement of 1925 is practically a dead letter, the Company stated tnat they would deprecate the Irapi Government being so informed, and tney suggested that as they had been consulted in the earlier stages when the draft Conservancy Convention was being formulated they might be given an opportunity of considering any amendments which might afiect their interests.

IN continuation of paragraph 10 of Sir Francis Humphrys’s despatch No. 123 of the 4th March last, I have the honour to furnish the following particulars regarding the capital works programme of the Port of Basra for the financial years 1934-35 and 1935-36, the cost of which will be met from the reserve funds of the port. 2. The programme submitted by the Port Director for the financial year which ends on the 31st March, has several times been revised, and now comprises the following items :— (a) Construction of an air port at Maqil (&amp;) Reconstruction of “Viceroy” pier, with provision for a saluting base ... (c) Extension of the supply of electricity from the central power-house to the district of Abul Khasib Dinars. 23,500 8,400 10,000 41,900 3. The construction of a large air port for Basra, fully equipped on modern and scientific lines, is understood to have received the approval of the Government in principle, and the work has, to a large extent, already been carried out. The total cost is estimated to be 52,000 dinars, and the balance of 28,500 dinars is earmarked for expenditure during the coming financial year. 4. The work on the reconstruction of the Viceroy pier involves the rebuilding of a jetty originally constructed as a temporary landing place at Ashar by the military authorities for military purposes. It has since been utilised to accommodate native sea-going and river craft, but is now worn out. A saluting base will be built on the new pier. . 5. The money to be spent upon the extension of the mains of the central power-house to Abul Khasib represents a further investment of port funds, from which substantial financial benefit should be derived. p t • 6 . The above proposals have been under the consideration of the Iraqi Government for more than a year, and according to my information have been approved in principle. Nevertheless, the sanction of Parliament has not ye been given. Considerable progress has been made towards the completion o the work, and, as there is no possibility of the law being passed during t e financial year which has just ended, the Port Director may subsequently find some difficulty with the Comptroller and Auditor-General. 7. In addition to the above he has submitted to the Government a fur ei programme of capital works which he proposes to carry out during 1935-3 , some of which will extend into 1936-37. The expenditure involved is estimated as follows:— 1935- 36— Continuation works ... New proposals 1936- 37- 0 Continuation works ... ••• ••• o,zuu Full details of the proposals are contained in the attached copy of a lettei fiom the Port Director, addressed to the Ministry of Finance.() e on T 1 . e ,, calls for special comment is the proposal to spend 50,000 dinars upon e m tion of a central water supply system for Basra and the adjacen is ric s, w (p Not printed Dinars. 28,500 81.300 [381 p—2]will absorb the present inadequate town supply. This will be controll H Port Directorate on lines similar to those governing the management f ^ successful central power-house. The port surplus funds will be msuffi ' ^ finance the whole of this work, and it is proposed that the Iraqi Treasu to advance a sum of 30,000 dinars as a loan. As the project was conceiv I Government and is being undertaken by the Port Director at their beh t • ^ unlikely that there will be any undue difficulty over this proposal. eSt ’ ^ 8 . The attitude of the Ministry of Finance towards the other item programme is not yet known. The expenditure upon the air port is greaf 8 ° was originally estimated, and if the full programme is sanctioned the ^ ^ an funds of the port will have been wholly spent. The revenue likely to be J eServe by the port from the air port will not for many years be commensurate w't}!? heavy expenditure incurred, and it is a development which mighf 1 ^ appropriately have been financed by the Treasury. On the other lianr| m0 |! e investments in the electricity and water undertakings are directly remune t' I am advised that there is no reason to apprehend that the expenditure whA 6 ' is proposed to finance from the reserve funds will affect the ability of th ^ ^ to continue the annual payment to His Majesty’s Government in liquidati ^ the capital debt. It does not appear desirable that His Majesty’s Govern° n ^ should raise any objection to the proposals on the ground that the fma 1 *^ 11 ! stability of the port will be in any way impaired if the expenditure is approval 9. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Department of OvpiL'. Trade and to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran. ' I have, &amp;c. ARCHIBALD CLARK KERR.0. 243 146/112/34) Sir, In his telegram No. 17 of the 16th January Sir Francis Humphrys informed me that Colonel Ward agreed with the suggestion made in my despatch No.880 of the 80th December, 1934, that the whole of the Bahmanshir should if possible be included among the v/aters to be controlled by the proposed Tripartite Conservancy Board for the Shatt-el-Arab, although he was doubtful whether the suggestion would be welcome to the Persian Government. Sir Francis Humphrys also indicated that the alterations in Article 2 of the draft convention proposed in my despatch No. 880 with a view to putting this suggestion into effect appeared to be suitable, while in his despatch No. 27 of the 19th January His Majesty's Minister at Tehran expressed views very similar in effect to those of Colonel Ward. 2. The developments y/hich have occurred during the last three months in the Perso-Iraqi frontier dispute have rendered extremely improbable the early conclusion of the Conservancy Board Convention, or even the early opening of any negotiations to that end. But although the question is thus not one of immediate urgency, it is desirable that the proposed alterations in Article 2 should be agreed upon as between His Majesty's Government and the Iraqi Government without undue delay. 3.

[E 1787/1181/93] Sir F. Humphrys to Sir John Simon.—(Received March 18.) gjj? ^ Bagdad, March 4, 1935. ’ WITH reference to my despatch No. 263 of the lOt'h May, 1934, I have the honour to transmit herewith two statements showing the budget estimates of the Port of Basra for the coming financial year, in the form in which they have been sent forward by the Government for consideration by the Iraqi Parliament^ 1 ) A sub-committee has been formed from the Finance Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, and has proceeded to Basra to examine the estimates in consultation with the’ Port Director. 2. The figures, as compared with those of the estimates for the current financial year, are as follows :— Revenue. Expenditure. Surplus. £ £ £ 1934- 35 ... 261,500 259,190 2,310 1935- 36 ... 273,140 272,651 489 The operations of the current year are expected to result in an actual surplus of approximately £10,000. The realisation of a revenue suiplus gi eater than the estimate has been an annual achievement of the Port Director for some years past, and the estimates now under consideration have doubtless been framed on similarly conservative lines. . , 3 . The revenue figures have been prepared on the assumption tJiat tne Government will approve a reduction, with effect from the 1st April, of 2 fils per ton in port dues “ A.” These dues are charged on all sea-going vessels of 10 tons, and upwards crossing the outer Bar, and the reduction is estimated to cost t e Directorate approximately £10,000 a year. Notwithstanding this, and further reductions which are being introduced in the scale of charges for services rendered on port premises, the total revenue is estimated to exceed that oi the current financial year by £11,640. An increase in the volume of imports handled by the port is expected to follow the improvement m trade which is now visible. It is also anticipated that shipping tonnage entering port limits will increase and that greater use will be made of the port creek dredger, from the hire of which substantial fees are derived. u a 4. The benefit accorded to vessels entering the Port of Basra by the reduction in port dues “ A ” will be tempered by the proposed imposition of a sanitary due ” of 3 fils per gross registered ton on all shipping entering the port, it is suggested that this due should be imposed with effect from the s anuary, &gt; in order to meet the cost of a new sanitary and quarantine sei\ice w ic 18 ^ consideration for establishment in the port to meet international hea requirements. The charge will not be levied on tanker traffic and ot ^ jessels not actually entering the Port of Basra. The scheme for setting up a san ) has not yet received the formal sanction of the Iraqi Governmen . 5. The estimates include the anticipated receipts a nd_ expenditure of Basra Power House, which generates and supplies power w lmlk to the porff Royal Air Force and the Basra Municipality at the rate of s ( 2 •) J? * It is proposed to reduce the rate to 8 fils (2t£.) per uni , wi e n f 1st April next. Although the estimates of the power house show an ex^ of £254 only of revenue over expenditure, the undertaking represen s Thu* investment of port funds, from which the Port Directorate rece ^®® 1 ~ electrical' has considerably reduced the cost to the port of the large qu y energy necessary for its normal operations. Maipctv’* 6 . Full provision is made in the estimates for the paym i 1 j ' j Government in March 1936 of the twelfth instalment of the capital debt, and p) Not printed. [356 s—2]2 interest charges, amounting in all to £34,200. There is every reason to r • that this payment will be forthcoming on due date. Adequate provisionh^ ate been made for depreciation from revenue, of the additions to capital asset i? 80 have been financed from surplus revenues. ts w hich 7. I also have the honour to transmit herewith two statements ( l \ anticipated revenue and one of anticipated expenditure, of the Fao Bar service for the coming year. Receipts ... Expenditure The figures are as under Surplus £ 162,500 162,045 455 The estimates of revenue are based on the assumption that the volume of shin ' now using the dredged channel will be maintained. Allowance has been m ^ for a further reduction of 15 per cent, in the dredging due charged on shipping-f take effect from the 1 st April next. The estimates have been drawn up on the b ° that the scale of charges should be no more than sufficient to meet the bona fide^\ of the service. The rate of the dredging due will then have been reduced^ 36 • 25 per cent, since the repayment to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company of t/ money lent by them for the purpose of dredging the channel. 1 e 8 . The figures of expenditure take- into account the cost of manning an ] operating the third dredger, the delivery of which is expected by the beginning of the new financial year. A serious set-back was experienced during the last flood season as the result of a heavy accumulation of silt within the dredged limits which reduced the width of the channel. The efforts of the two dredgers now in use have, by working day and night, been sufficient to maintain the navigable depth of water in the channel only, without further consolidating and improving it. Although, therefore, it had been hoped to reduce the hours of dredging when the third dredger arrived, the estimates have had to be drawn up on the basis that the new dredger, as well as the other two, will work day and night throughout the year. Provision is contained in the estimates for the final payment of £20,000 on account of the purchase price of the dredger. 9. In addition to the revenue estimates of the dredging service, the Port Director has submitted a programme of capital works estimated to cost £79,000 spread equally over the financial years 1935-36 and 1936-37. Permanent buildings for staff and workshops at Fao will account for £55,500 of this amount, and the rest is to be expended upon improving and augmenting the craft,’ machinery and equipment available for the dredging service. The cost of this programme will be met from the reserve and surplus funds held by the Port Director on behalf of the dredging service. 10. The Port Director has also submitted a further programme of capital works for the Port of Basra for the coming financial year, which, together with that referred to in paragraph 10 of my despatch under reference, is still under the consideration of the Government. I will submit later a separate report regarding this item. 11 . I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade and to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran. I have, &amp;c. F. H.

D*0 *Ko# 69-3 of 1935 The Residency, Bushire, the 12th January, 1935 Could you please refer to paragraph 3 of Cgilvie- Forbes 1 demi-official letter to Rendel, Ko.280/12/34, dated the 6th October 1934, on the subject of pilots for the Shatt- al-Arab, a copy of which came to me in the course of official routine, and which 1 kept it by me until 1 could discuss it with Dickson during my recent visit to Kuwait* 2* The paragraph in question ran as follows:(I quote it for ready reference) M The next best thing might be Kuwaitis, who are sea~minded, but the objection to employing them is that so many are indentured in the pearl diving trade, under conditions almost of slavery* Xi they abandoned that calling in favour of piloting, they would be made to suffer in various ways.' 3. I’m afraid I must take some exception to Ogilvie- Forbes* remarks* In the first place this hit at Kuwait seems to me rather gratuitous in the context in which it ap,sans. ^uite apart from the Kuwaiti divers, as Cgilvie- Forbes must know there are many Kuwaiti dhows the crews of which are line seamen, and who would certainly be quite willing to become pilots provided they were ofit-ed sufficient pay. There was no reason theretore, as iar as I con see, for the question of the divers to be brought up. 4. in the second place Ugilvie-lorbes' statement that the divers work under conditions almost oi sxaver^. j-s HU fwellency ;, *HeHun3phrys,G*C*M.G*tG*C*V*0*, K • R *~4 •, C • i * * His Majesty’s i.iabassador, Bagdad borne /(2) / borne out by actual facts which are as follows, as supplied to in a report by aichson. Dickson during his time at Kuwait, some six years now, has had no complaints from divers of bad treatment, though there have been ample opportunities for divers to make such complaints. Most diving cases are heard by the Shaikh himself 1 , or his deputy Shaikh Abdulla, the remainder of the eases being tried in a local Court unaer one abu fiammaz, a retired dhow Captain. The dhaikh, on whom the main responsi bility rests for the conauct of the diving, whatever his faults , oay be. is a humane man, and Abu Garanaz has the confidence of the sea-faring community. Moreover motives of expediency enter into the treatment of divers quite apart from those of humanity . or justice. nothing is easier for a diver, if he feels he la being harshly treated or harassed over hie debts, than to cross the frontier into Reja or Iraq. Consistent bad treatment of divers would result in wholesale desertions, which would certain ly not suit the Shaikh, and such desertions do not occur. as ; a matter of fact the diving profession seems to be popular as thousands of individuals come to Kuwait yearly from Kejd and Iraq to try their luck on the Banks* S. The following are some details as to how the business side of the diving is conducted: (1) The season lasts about 4 months in every jear,i.e. from June to September. Before a diver goes to the anKs he receives from his boat captain an advance of money, (fixed by the Shaikh for the whole diving fraternity), for himself and his family. Similarly on return from the Banks the diver gets another advance to help him through until the next season. Botn advances are about Rs.50/-(2) The above advances are recov«r^d from the divert share of the catch, but if trie boat is unlucky and the catch poor, then under the diving law the debt is carried forward until next year. No interest is charg ed* (3) By the Shaikh’s orders the employers, or actual owner* of boats, who stay on shore whefc the diving is in progress, have tc see as far as possible that the divers 1 families do not get into difficulties when their men folk are at sea. (4) The son of a deceased diver can only be made to work off his father’s debts by a creditor if he - the son - wishes to follow in his father’s footsteps as a diver. Should the son decide to follow scrae other profession he is free to do so arid the creditor has no claim on his services* ( 6 ) The property of the widow of a deceased diver cannot be seized for debt provided it is registered in her name* 6 . I certainly do not wish to pitch my case too high, or to maintain that everything is perfect with regard to Kuwait diving, or that cases of individual harship do not occur. But such cases are not peculiar to Kuwait * all over the world, even in England, labour conditions are far from perfect. Much poverty no doubt exists amongst the Kuwait divers, but one has to remember that of late years the bottom i*as dropped out of the pearl market. The divers themselves, too, work ing in a trade which is in the nature of a gamble on the catch .re feckless folk and readily allow themselves to drift into debt, while I do not suppose that creditors in Kuwait are /are any more tender-hearted than those elsewhere. On the other hand unlike their colleagues in most other countries they are not allowed to extort interest. 7 , In conclusion it appears to me that tgllvie-Forbes 1 statement that the Kuwait clivers work M under conditions almost 0 £ slavei'y ’ 1 gives quite a wrong impression, and 1 cannot help reeling that it is somewhat umurtunate that, before making tills statement in a demi-official letter which has had official circulation, he did not apply either to Dickson or myself* for further information on the subject. 1 am sending a copy of this letter to Metcalf© and Laithwaite * Yours sincerely, sd.T.C.Fowle....J IlgW ^ r* :707 a.73/u5« 31st January, 5 - ' Sir, Kith, referonce to your letter of the &lt;2nd January, Ho.E.6956/58/34, I am coraanded by ly lords W ^ fy t commissioners of the Admiralty to acqurdnt you, for the information of the Secretary of State for foreign Sffairs, that they concur in the proposal to amena Article 20 of the draft Shatt-el-^Arab Oonservancy Board Oonvention in the sense suggested by Sir Francis Humphrys.

This suggestion would,if adopted, entail the amendment of Article 2 of the draft convention (see my despatch No.390 of 7th June, 1934). At present this article reads as follows : ’’The Shatt-el-Arab the Bahmanshir river ”from its junction with the Karun river to a point one of the measures needed to ensure that the Shatt-el-A.rab shall ’’mile from that point, (etc.) shall be placed under n the control and administrative authority of a ”Conservancy Board....” but it rniaht be altered to read: 'The Shatt-el-Arab the Bahmanshir River from the point of its separation from the narun river 'to the sea, including its appr nrcaches from the seaward ’’side, .... shall be placed etc h Excellency Ll eutenantl Colonel - uanci s Humphry s , G . C , M . G . , G * C . V . 0. , etc., etc. , etc., Bagdad.2 . It is only logical that if the Conservancy Board is to have the power to divert water from the Karan River above Moharamerah into the Bahmanshir its power should extend down -^he whole course of the channel (i«e. the Bahmanshir) into which that water is to be diverted. The Board might, for example, decide that it was necessary, in order to reduce the amount of silt coming into the Shatt-el-Arab from the Karun, to make some kind of a groyne or dam. just above Mohammerah which would send a greater proportion of the Karun water down the Bahmanshir, and this might lead to the Bahmanshir itself silting up at some point on its course. This silting might presumably in turn lead to the Bahmanshir breaking its banks, and If such a break were to occur sufficiently near to the K' - North Western end of the Bahmanshir extensive damage might conceivably be done to the town and refinery of nbadan. Moreover if such a break were to occur it is presumably conceivable that the Bahmanshir might then cut a new channel across Abadan island into the Shatt-el-Arab, and this might again affect the navigation of the Shatt through an alteration in the flow of the existing currents and the depositing of silt at new and unexpected points. If the Board had no authority over the Bahmanshir, there would be no guarantee that such Gangers or any other possible complications ox a similar nature could be remedied; but if the whole of the Bahmanshir fell within their jurisdiction they could from the outset take any necessary steps to guard against them e • A• D 3 7 dredging the channel or strengthening the banks wherever this might be required. 3. A further argument in favour of extending the Board s sphere of control is that It is that it does not yet appear to te conclusively established, In spite of the opinions c ,i venby eminent engineering authorities in the past in this sense, that the Bahmanshir could not be made navigable for vessels of medium draught. You will recollect, for example, that in his 'Memorandum on the History of Steam Navigation in the Middle 'East” Mr. T.G. McNie relates how the 'Comet” escaped from Mohammerah on the outbreak of war with Turkey in 1914 by way 0 f the Bahmanshir (see page 8 of the version printed in the Foreign Office (E 6501/5462/93) of which copies have already reached you in Eastern Department’s letter to the Chancery of 7th December). In spite of the shallow draught of the /'* V 'Comet” (three feet), this feat suggests that, apart from the existence of mud-banks, there may be no insuperable obstacle to the use of 'the Bahmanshir as a waterway and if its use as a waterway were ever, or for any reason, to be developed, it would seem, eminently desirable that it should be brought under the same control as the adjoining waterway of ohe Shatt—el—Arab# 4, These considerations might not, admittedly, appeal to the Persian Government, #iose main motive ion embarking upon oO expensive an operation as a regular programme of dredging in the Bahmanshir would be the provision ox an a 11 -x ,.ric.,i approach for their warships, if for vessels of no deeper draught, to the fresh-water port of hohammerah* In the situation hitherto contemplated i*e. the oxfer of the Conservancy Board to the Persian Government as a substitute for territorial adjustments in the Shatt-el-er^b YiOx ^ would indeed be no particular Inducement which could be offexed the Persian Government for the extension of the Board’s control beyond the limits specified In the draft Convention already m their possession; while uhe fact that this draft provides for no wider limits can doubtless be ascribed to the^ de of/of the drafters to render the whole Convention as easy as possible of Persian acceptance. But in the situation recently i.e. the acceptance of the Conservancy Board by . Government as the price of territorial adjustment, the position would clearly be different, since His Majesty's Government and the Iraqi Government would be in a far stronger oosition for imposing their own conditions and the Persian Government, as they would, under the suggested bargain, secure territorial sovereignty on their own side of the Shatt-el-Arab, would have less inducement to develop the Bahmanshir in opposition to the Shatt and might therefore the more readily agree to its being brought wholly under the control of the proposed Board. 5, But in whatever manner the question of territorial ( adjustment may develop in the future, it does not appear that it could do any harm to put the point forward if the Conservancy Board proposals ever reach the stage of active oiscussion with the Persian Government. In the meanwhile I shall be glad if you will furnish me with any observations which you may have to offer on this suggestion, after consulting Colonel ai^ to whom however no mention should be made of the political considerations referred to in the immediately preceding para graph, since it is important that the tentative suggestions which have been put forward for a possible Perso-Iraqi bargain, by which the Conservancy Board. Convention should be secured at the price of a readjustment of the Shatt frontier, should be treated as strictly confidential. 6.

Admiralty, 28th November, 1934. * My dear Rendel, The assessment of the dangers threatening the Shatt-el-Arab has led us to look again at the draft Conservancy Convention. You will doubtless already have realised tha.t the considerations advanced in King’s letter M.02770/34 of the 7th November suggest that it might be desirable for the Conservancy Board to have jurisdiction over the whole of the Bahmanshir, not merely the portion which lies within a mile of the junction with the Karun (See Article 2 of the draft Convention). If the Convention is to go forward, yon may be able to find some suitable opportunity for amending the draft in this respect - that is, unless you think it would be very obnoxious to the Persians I We d.o not, however, in the present limited state technical knowledge of the problem, regard it : essential to press this point. I am sending copies of this letter to irie, Osborne and Brandon. Yours sincerely, (Signed) E.A. Seal. (l 151 T5 1 tendel, Esq. , C.M.G. , foreign OFFICE,, ne No. ■ WHITEHALL 1234.

'That Article provide? for the assumption by the Conservancy Board of the liquidation of the debt due by the Government of Iraq to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Ltd. in respect of the monies provided by the Company for the initial cost of the dredging operations at the Bhatt-al-Arab bar. obligations and benefits arising out of the Dredging Agreement of 19th March, 1925, concluded between the Government and the Company, as modified by the agreement of 2nd June, also to be transferred to the Conservancy Board. 3, The position has changed since that Article drafted. The whole of the debt due to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company has been repaid and. nothing is now owing account.

Foreign Office, June 7, 1934. k 1 ’ j jjave to inform you that a recent re-examination of the latest provisional xt of the draft Shatt-el-Arab Conservancy Board Convention (a copy of which was sent to you in my despatch No. 89 of the 11 th February, 1933), has revealed die need for the following minor alteration. 2 The second paragraph of article 18 at present runs as follows :— “Each member of the board shall, in the territory of a high contracting party other than that by whom he was appointed, be entitled to the same privileges and immunities as if he were a member of a diplomatic mission to such high contracting party.” In view of the fact that nominations are, by virtue of article 3 of the convention, to be made by His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, the Persian Government/ and the Iraqi Government respectively, and not by the high contracting parties {i.e., the three sovereigns in person), the above-quoted passage should be amended to read :— “The Governments of the United Kingdom, Persia, and Iraq will each respectively recognise the members, appointed in accordance with article 3 by either of the other two Governments, as being entitled to diplomatic privileges and immunity.” 3 As you will observe, the foregoing amendment is of formal rather than practical importance, and should be accepted without difficulty by the Iraqi Government. I request that, should a suitable opportunity present itselt tor doing so you will arrange for its incorporation both in the Arabic text m the possession of the Iraqi Government and in the text communicated by them to the Persian Minister at Bagdad. . . , 4 . Should the negotiation of the proposed convention again become a practical question, it will eventually be necessary to reach a decision as e language or languages to be used in it, and to insert in the drait text a na para graph on this subject. The point should be borne in mind, but the prospec s o concluding the convention, or even of discussing it in detail wl th the ersian Government, now appear so slender that there is no need to consider i ur er at the present stage. . ^ rr i 5.

Please see Mr*Cleary’s minute at devious papers :— 2730 1000 4.34 P.Z. 38 61/M. This Office does not appear to have received a copy of the unratified Fao Bar dredging agreement of 2nd June 1932, between the Iraqi Government and the A.P*0.C., and the earlier papers on this subject were not sent to us by the Colonial Office. JThe present position arises from the fact that trie Iraqis recently paid off the whole of the debt due to the A.P.O.C. on account of the loan made by the Company for the dredging of the Hooka Channel, the very heavy dredging dues imposed on shipping in the Shatt w*%mu5h larger than necessary for the needs of the dredging srvice. Since A.P.O.C. tankers pay about 90/90 per cent of these dues, the Company were naturally anxious to obtain a.n assurance from the Iraqi Government J such as had apparently been provided for in the unratified dredging dues agreement^that in future the dues would be adjusted to the actual cost of the dredging operations. The Iraqi Government^who refused to ratify the dredging agreement at first showed some indication of a desire to raid the surplus revenues of the Dredging Fund and devote ^ to other purposes, but they are now aware of the danger that by charging unreasonable dues they may provoke the Persian Government to bring pressure to bear on the A.P.O.C. to transfer their operations from Abadan to Bandar Shapur in view of the fact that the large proportion of the dues are paid by the Company out of revenues derived from Persian oil. The Iraqi Government now see that their own interests and those of the Company are identical in this matter but^apart from the fact that the repayment of the A.P.C.C. loan would necessitate some amendments to the text of the unratified dredging agreement^it appears that their reason for refusing to ratify the agreement is one of amour P- r ..9.P l r , e .&gt; since they feel that it would be unbecoming for a Government to bind themselves to a commercial company in such a way as to forgo their sovereign right to impose such dues as they think fit. In view of this it was proposed to embody the principles of the unratified dredging agreement in an exchange of notes between the Iraqi Government and H.M.G., but, as explained in the minute a,t P.Z.38 61, H.M.G. obj ected to clause 5 of the draft exchange of notes proposed by H * M * S Ambassador at Bagdad (Flagged), because ^ wo uld^bind Uoe their best endeavours to encourage British 'pping to use the Shatt during the currency of the agreement and this might be extremely inconvenient for political reasons The same objections have since been strongly urged by H.M.’s Minioter, Tehran (Sir Reginald Hoare) in his despatch of 18th/18th May (P. Z. 4032/34) . Sir R.Hoare^s views are . interesting, especially on the extent as to which the A.P-O.C. could resist a demand from the Persian Government to transfer from Abadan to Bandar Shapur, and whether it would be desirable for H.M.G. to prevent the Company from making such a move by the use of their veto (paras. 4 and following). He considers that the Company would be most unwise to refuse such a demand except on purely financial grounds and that a refusal on the grounds that they were committed to Iraq or that it was contrary to the wishes of H.M.G. would have a most unfortunate effect. 4 3. A 2b% reduction of the dredging dues has now become effective, and it will be seen from the Foreign Office despatch of 17th September to Bagdad below (P. Z. 5952/34) that the whole question has been recently discussed by the Foreign Office with Sir Francis Humphrys and the Basra Port Director, who have been on leave in this country, and with the A.P.O.C. It has been agreed as a result of these discussions that the object of the A.P.O.C. - viz. to obtain a.n assurance that the Iraqis will adjust the dues according to the actual cost of dredging operations - can be attained without the necessity of an exchange of notes between H.M.G. and the Iraqi Government, if the latter are prepared to repeat or confirm the assurance already given orally to the Ambassador by the late Iraqi Minister of Finance and reported in his Saving telegram of 10th May (Flag C). Sir Francis Humphrys has been instructed to try and obtain confirmation of this assurance on his return to Bagdad. 4. Reference is also invited to papers at P.Z. 4014/34 and P.Z.4909/34 about the rumoured intentions of the Persian Government to use pilots of their own in the Shatt/Shatt-el-Arab, and to treat Abadan as a wholly Persian port, appointing harbour masters and charging port dues independent of the charges made by the port of Basra. Colonel Ward, the Basra Port Director, was apprehensive that there might be something in this and that the Persians might attempt to dragoon his pilots, who are all Persian subjects, into joining their own service. It will be seen from P.Z.5039/34 that Colonel Ward is thinking of retiring, and in this event we have heard rumours that the Iraqis have some intention of appointing an Iraqi to succeed him. The efficient maintenance of the Shatt waterway during the last few years has been almost entirely due to the competence and energy of Colonel Ward and his success in overcoming Persian obstruction, and the appointment of an Iraqi Port Director in his place would almost certainly have most unfortunate results.

Clause 5, which of course has not Been shown to Iraqi Government, was inserted mainly as window-dressing in order to induce the Iraqi Government to agree to the wording of a document which otherwise appears to he one-sided, and to enable Minister of Finance more easily to defend agreement if called upon to do so. It was not intended to lay a moral obligation on His Majesty's Government to use their veto (md its wording would have to be stretched to do so) ’out by expressing a general desire to maintain the status quo to act as a deterrent to prevent the Persian Government from pressing the transfer of Anglo-Persian tanhers from I Abadan bo Bandar Sdalrpur 0 I confess that/ I do not understand Company's oejection to clause 5 and I would reiterate my conviction that for ^ I Company to use threat of transfer in order to oring lro.qi Government to terms would he a mistake in tactics and ±o,±± in its object.

The Minister also Informed me that the Government were quite willing to negotiate an exchange of notes With me on this question but preferred not to make an agreement with the Company. I feel that it will be difficult to satisfy the Iraqi Government of the value of such notes unless His Majesty's Government declare their interest in maintaining the status quo. If we fail to satisfy Iraq on this point we must reconcile ourselves to the possibility of seeing the -aooka Channel go out of action. Without dues paid cy the Company's tankers, dredging could not be continued and the Channel would soon silt up.

During the paet week I have heard persistent rumours to the effect that the Persian luthoritiee intend to station a Pilot-Vessel in the vicinity of Hooka Float on the Outer Bar for the purpose of supplying Pilots to vessels proceeding to the new port of Bander Shahpour, also to supply pilots to the Persian Men-o-war when navigating the fhatt-al-Arab. Our Pilots are uneasy about this matter, they fear that they may be intimidated into joining the Pilotage Service that the Persian Authorities are about to institute. \r there are no persons qualified to be a pilot on the Shatt-al-trab other than the pilots in our Bervice, it is con sidered almost certain by our Pilots that they will be pressed to join the Persian ervice, particularly for the Shatt-al-\rab. I am informed that previous attempts have been made to persuade one or two of our Pilots to join the Persian Marine Service without result. I also hear that the Persian Authorities intend to treat Abadan as a Persian Port entirely; rumour has it that they are appointing a Port officer and that an attempt will be made to establish Persian Harbour Masters at Abadan to berth all vessels using the Abadan Jetties, and that j-ort Dues will be charged independent of any charges made by the Port of Basrah. The Pilot Vessel referred to is reported to be being built in I taly and that it is nearing completion.I am unable to vouch for the veracity of these rumours 1'ut uneasiness appears to prevail amongst our Pilots on account of them and I have deemed it my duty to make this report In case there should he any substance in the information quoted above please.

The papers now added deal mainly with the Fao Bar Dredging Agreement between the iIraqi Government and the A.P.O.C. This has not yet been ratified by the -Iraqi Government owing to the fact that the repayment of the loan made to them by the A.P.O.C. for dredging the Boole*- channel makes some amendments to the text necessary and to the objection to negotiating with a private company. Accordingly it has now been proposed I that an agreement regarding the maintenance I of the Iraq ports and their approaches should ’ *e negotiated between H.M.G. and the -Iraqi Government. H.M.G. have not yet been able to come to a decision on the proposals, which will 1 J { kbe found in the Draft Exchange of Notes below, mainly because they would (see Clause 5) bind to use their best endeavours to encourage shipping (and, in particular, A.P.0.C.shipping) to use the Shatt-el-Arab during the currency of the Agreement. This might be inconvenient both to the A.P.O.C. themselves and to H.M.G. To the A.P.O.C. because they may find it desirable,either on account of economic pressure from Persia or through the fapacity of Iraq, to be able to transfer their shipping base from Abadan^ to Bandar Shahpur; and to H.M.G. because in this event the clause may have serious repercussions on our relations with Persia or, alternatively, f Iraq. This Agreement could apparently co-exist with the proposed Conservancy Board Convention, though the latter would appear to require some modification if it is not to overlap with the former. In any case Art.20 (ii) of the Convention^wi 11 now require amending. But according to Sir B .Hoare’s despatch of the 24th March below the Conservancy Board J' 2., ^ Convention has become now far less attractive to Persia than it was a few years ago. This is ascribed to the Shah’s desire to develop the new port of Bandar Shahpur and his eagerness to strike a blow at the prosperity of ’Iraq, both of which may cause him to put pressure on the A.P.O.C. to transfer their shipping base to Bandar Shahpur. There is also the question of the frontier in the Shatt-el-Arab which is likely to remain an obstacle to the conclusion of any such Convention . t /S' X S JUN 1334(NDEA^-O communication on this subject, please quote 1 ' anyfurterc No ^ \^. jm+'c/m hv YlCLfflC* but to “The l-P*JL /'Ml' 9 c*&lt;. s)it4/ii ■ u % , rmt to any person by name, but to— U^der-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. i. 1 19 3 4 _J _ THE Onder-Secretary of State for Foreign affairs 'presents Oris cunipli nie,ltlK to **' ^ and, by direction of the Secretary of State, transmits herewith cop^a-o of the under-mentioned paper.

Sir, vifith reference to Sir Hubert Young T s despatch to the Colonial Office No. 895 of September 10th, 1932, I have the honour to inform you that the revised agreement of June 2nd 1952 between the Government of ’Iraq and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Limited, relating to the dredging of the Shatt-al-Arab bar and the approaches thereto has not yet been ratified, and that the Government have now withdrawn it from Parliament. 2. The ostensible reason for the withdrawal is that amendments to the text are necessary. This is true inasmuch as, when the agreement was signed a sum of £232,000 still remained due to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company on account of the loans made by them from which the cost of dredging the hooka channel was met. The steady increase in the revenue derived from the heavy dues levied upon the shipping utilising the dredged waterway has enabled the Government to extinguish this debt at a greater speed than was originally anticipated, and the loans have now been entirely repaid. As the new agreement prescribes the method in which the outstanding oalance of the debt should be liquidated, it is comprehensiole that the ’Iraqi Government should no 7 / wish to delete references to that balance from the agreement. 3. This, however, is not the whole picture* iV itii the extinction of the debt, the conditions 01 the old dredging /agreement, ‘ta Sight Hon'ble, ilr John Simon, G.C.S.I., K.C.V.O., etc* . et c« . etc .,oa-reement, which is still nominally in force, have been ^•uifilleh and the whole of the dredgers and the equipment have become the unencumbered property of the Government. -liere is now nothing to prevent the Government from disposing of the surplus revenues in any manner they think fit. I am advised that, when the original agreement was concluded in 1925, there was an implied understanding between the Government and the Company that, when the channel was finished and the construction charges were paid off, the dredging dues would be reduced to a scale which would be just sufficient to pay the cost of maintenance. There was, however, no written undertaking to this effect. 4, The sums of money involved are of some magnitude. Tor the past calendar year, the receipts and expenditure of the ifao Bar Dredging Service were approximately as fo Hows revenue .. £300,000 Expenditure •• £120,000 leaving a surplus of £180,000, from which payments nave ^ been made on account of interest on the outstanding balance of the loan and the final liquidation oi the loan itself. The figure of expenditure includes the necessary provision for depreciation, and with the disappearance of loan charges this surplus will represent the annual pro lit accruing from the operations of the dredging service at the existing scale Ox charges. On the other hand, the Anglo-Persian Oil company pay more than 90;J of the dues collected from shipping usin.. uhe dredged channel and, if the dues are not reduced, they will feel, wi th justification, that they are being defrauded oi £140,000 annually, 5. If there is no appreciable diminution in the volume of tanker shipping it would be possible to reduce the present scale /ofof charges by 50jb and still leave amply sufficient revenue to cover all expenses and depreciation, with, a reserve for contingencies. 6 . The ’Iraqi Grovernment are well aware of the facts in the preceding paragraphs and their continued failure, despite numerous representations, to secure the ratification of the new agreement, has two possible motives, viz: (a) the desire to use the threat of non-ratification as a weapon with which to extort from the Oil Company a reduction in the sale price of oil and oil products in ’Iraq; (b) the reluctance to foijjjgo the chance of making xs Mr. Ogilvie Forbes reported in his despatch No. 424 of July 4th last, the late Minister of Finance, Yasin Pasha, had conceived the idea of appropriating the surplus revenues of the Fao Bar Dredging Service for the purpose of paying off the balance of the capital indebtedness of the Port of Basrah to His Majesty’s Government. He so far committed himself to the policy of treating the surplus revenues as available for allocation by the ’Iraqi Government as to authorise the Port Director to order a third dredger to be paid lor from these funds. It is only fair to add that Colonel ward, the Director of the Port of Basrah, failed to ino/uce the Anglo— Persian Oil Company to find the money for this purpose. The present Minister of Finance is, I believe, a disciple Oj. Yasin Pasha in this matter and shows the same unwillingness xorego the chance of making the tanker traffic supply rundj-r^m wnich to buy His Majesty’s Government out oi the Port Oj. Basrah. The fact that it would be unjust, to say the least, -j-Or the Government to continue to charge dues at rates which, a large and easy profit. /owingowing to the extinction of the debt, have become exorbitant, does not appear to weigh heavily with him. 7 . I have for some time endeavoured orally to convince both the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the iCingr that failure to ratify the agreement is a short sighted policy, which may ultimately prove to have serious consecuences for ’Iraq. I have warned them that it is Quite likely that the Persian Government will bring pressure to bear on the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to fill their tankers at the Persian Port of Bandar Shahpur instead of at do ad an, and that, if the Company could not point to a written agreement with the ’Iraqi Government committing them to continue to use the Hooka channel, they might be unable to resist such pressure. I emphasised the fact that over 90/b of the shipping from which the dues are collected is travelling to and from Persian ports, and that it would be grossly improper for the ’Iraqi Government to tax this shipping by levying disproportionate dredging dues ::or the purpose of making a large profit. If the Anglo-Persian Oil Company were to move their oil port to Bandar ohahpur the amount of traffic passing through the dredged channel would be insufficient, by a large margin, to meet the cost of naintaining it. The channel would silt up and, instead the ’Iraqi Government having, at no cost to themselves, a deep water approach to their only seaport, shipping bound ^or Iraq would be foroed to use the western channel ;vnich provides for a draft of 15 feet or less at high tide. 8. Incidentally, I was informed a few days ago by Lr. Gass, the Deputy Manager of the Anglo-Persian Oil who negotiated the revised agreement at the time Oo. a-s signature, that it had been demonstrated thao i~ u.ic ^c ale o^ dredging charges was not lowered, it would, pay the Company to aove to Bandar Shahpur. The Persian. Government woulo. /probablyprobably willingly provide the Port facilities that they &lt;4*2J required there at cost price and the 1 Iraqi Grovernment could by no means assume that the Company would continue -to send their tankers to and from Abadan at any price. I did not pass this information on to the ’Iraqi Government, as they would never believe that the Company would willingly transfer its tankers to so bad an anchorage as Bandar Shahpur, where they might soon find themselves exposed to worse forms of rapacity at the hands of the Persian Government. 9. Nuri Pasha informs me that the Council of Ministers have reconsidered the question and are now generally convinced that it is in the best interests of ’Iraq that the agreement should be ratified. The Minister of Finance is, however, not yet converted. Nuri Pasha tells me that the Government will probably ask for the agreement to be revised for the reason ■ \ given in paragraph 2, i.e. that the liquidation of the loan makes modification necessary. It seems likely that they will take advantage of this revision to endeavour to secure other alterations in the wording, notably to the provisions in Clause 9 to the effect that the dredging dues shall nou be increased or decreased by more than 25/o without the written consent of the Company. It is felt that these words are damaging to the amour propre of the Government, ana I have privately suggested to Nuri Pasha an amendment which would preserve the principle that dredging dues should be levied on a scale necessary to pay for dredging costs ana for nothing else. 10. It is the intention of the Government to invite a representative of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to oome up from Abadan in order to consider the amendments deoired and /Ihope that a definite move will be made n t - ae present 'Id Holidays are over.

(E 1914/21 5 / 93 ) gOii^Zt (^3/5/34) Bagdad, 14th -arch» 1934, Sir ? i , n — In the last paragraph of my despatch Ko,42 of January 22nd last, I had the honour to inform you of the intention of the then Iraqi Government to discuss with a representative of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company certain amendments in the unratified Fao Bar Dredging Agreement of June 2nd, 1932* 2» The recent change in the Cabinet appears, however, to have brought about a change in the Governments attitude towards this agreement. I am Informed that the hew Minister of Finance = Kaji Pasha Suwaidi - is unconvinced as to the necessity for the agreement, and the question of further discussion with the Company is not being pursued for the moment. 3. On the other hand, Mr. Hogg, the Adviser to the Ministry of Finance, informed me on March 5th that his Minister was about to recommend to the Council of Ministers a reduction of 30$ in the dredging dues with effect from April 1st next, and that it was intended to purchase a third dredger from the surplus assets ol the Dredging Fund. This would absorb the whole of the reserves of the fund. 4. Both Colonel Ward and Hr. Hogg consider that an arrangement on toese lines will be satisfactory and fair to the Anglo-Perslan Oil Company and that , if aaoyted ” 1 ' lU ' of the dredging dues, during the coming financial year at least, would be properly spent for the purpose for which they ere &amp;ght Honourable ~ Sir John Simon, G.CoS,I.» K,C.v.u.

The* sutoBtanttal reductions in the scale of d es should go far towards removing the grievance of the Company. § Mr. Hogg added that the Minister of Finance favoured the gnn*srvanejr Board.scheme and proposed, subject the consent of the Persian Goverasent, shortly to enter into negotiations with that Government and His Majesty's snbassy. The Minister for Foreign Affairs told me recently that he had comunicated privately to the Persian Minister in Bagdad a copy of the draft instrument which formed the enclosure to your despatch Ho»89_ of February lith, 1953. 6 Both Colonel t?ard and Mr. Hogg are of the opinion that if the Conservancy Board proposals are actually adopted, the ratification of the Fao Bar Dredging Agreement will no oince the dredgerssurvey ships 0 ®t€c t . tbr as their share of the assess TO »Td be handed over to the Boa.u as . . bv the port of Basra.

UNC LETTER c O * ® ^ PERSIA. September 27, 1933. ^ CONFIDENTIAL. Section 7 . [E 5741/91/34] No. 1 . CM- 5 Mr. Mallet to Sir John Simon.—(Received September 27.) (No. 431.) Sir, Gulhek, September 7, 1933. WITH reference to your despatch No. 332 of the 10th August last, and in amplification of my telegram No. 185 of the 29th August, I have the honour to inform you that the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs reverted to the whole question of Persia’s claims in the Shatt-el-Arab at an interview which I had with his Highness on that date. 2. Feroughi is evidently much obsessed with this question, which he regards as the main obstacle to better relations with Iraq. I do not encourage him to air his grievances about Iraq to me, but when such questions as the behaviour of the Persian navy are under discussion between us it is difficult to prevent him from turning the conversation to this topic. On this occasion I had been rehearsing the whole catalogue of misdeeds of the Persian navy in the hope of persuading him that Major Bayendor was not a fit person to be Senior Naval Officer, and I happened to mention the dangerous manner in which Persian men-of-war navigated the Shatt-el-Arab. I asked his Highness whether in this connexion he had received a report from the Persian Charge d’Affaires of the conversation mentioned in your despatch, and Feroughi replied in the affirmative. From this he launched out into the sad story of Persia’s grievances in the Shatt-el-Arab. Everything depended upon the interpretation of article 2 of the Treaty of Erzerum, which made over the eastern bank of the Shatt-el-Arab to Persia and gave the Persians complete liberty of navigating the river, but did not state that the waters of the river were definitely to be Turkish territorial waters. On this the 1913-14 frontier settlement was drawn up, but the Persian Government had never accepted it and considered it entirely unfair to Persia. His Highness went on to declare that Persia had no desire to grab fresh territory from the young nation of Iraq. Demonstrating his argument with an ashtray which lay between us, he said: “For me to take this ashtray and say it is mine, and for you to snatch it back and say ‘No, it is mine,’ would be a merely childish way to behave.. We Persians are not children, and we do not wish to behave in such a manner. What the Persian Government desired was that the Shatt-el-Arab should be declared an international waterway “like others.” _ . 3 . I said that I was not prepared to discuss the details of this question with Ms Highness, more especially as he already knew our point of view quite we lJ- He had heard from M. Nury what the Foreign Office thought of the subject, and, as we had just been mentioning the activities of the French lighting and buoying expert in the Gulf, I would add that our interest in the Shatt-el-Arab was. naturally to know that the best relations existed between the limitrophe States,, and from our own point of view to be assured that British shipping, which constituted the vast majority of the shipping in the waterway, shouM run no ns x through neglect of dredging or inadequate lighting and buoying. His Highness was well aware of the scheme propounded by Sir Francis Humphrys m the coui se of his visit here for the establishment of a tripartite conservancy board, r eroug i said: “Yes, the Persian Government accepted the idea. His Highness s subsequent remarks were not entirely clear to me, and, indeed, it is quite possib e that he himself was uncertain of his subject, but I took him to mean that e conservancy board would be all right, but there must, in addition, be some torm ot internationalisation of the waters of the Shatt-el-Arab. p • 4. I explained to his Highness that the question was obviously one for Persia a nd Iraq to negotiate between themselves, and that Iraq was now entirely independent and would expect to be treated as such. Feroughi expressed the greatest anxiety to respect the independence of Iraq in every possible way, e Wed that when the time came he might count upon the good offices ot His, [915 dd—7]2 Majesty’s Ambassador in Bagdad, for whom he had the greatest admiration I told his Highness that I felt sure that when the negotiations with Iraq were 11 under way, and if both parties desired the advice of Sir Francis Humnhrvs fn should be no difficulty in obtaining it. ^ ’ ere 5. I hope that my mention of the conservancy board idea, upon which I onl touched quite lightly, will not meet with your disapproval. When such subiec/ as the Shatt-el-Arab and the lighting and buoying in the Gulf are beino- discussed here it is almost impossible not to mention the scheme, which is, after alf the whol pivot of our policy in these matters. As you will see ’ from the enclosed memorandum by Mr. Baggallay of a conversation which he held with the head of the English Section of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, the Persian Government have evidently not been giving very serious consideration lately to the details of the scheme, but they have now, I hope, received a certain stimulus from us I realise that in speaking as I did to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I mav be held to have gone somewhat beyond the instructions contained in your telegram No 122 of the 17th August. The fact, however, that our conversation had touched upon M. Nury’s visit to Mr. Rendel made it very difficult for me to avoid all mention of the tripartite scheme. It may, in any case, be useful to have ascertained that in Feroughi’s mind the scheme is not entirely shelved. On the other hand there is always a danger that the Ministry of War may be going ahead with a quite independent plan without ever having heard of the conservancy board idea I hope that they may now, as the result of Mr. Baggallay’s talk with Sheyesteh and mine with Feroughi, be apprised of the real situation and shape their policy accordingly. ^ ^ 6 . I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad (No. 73), and to the Acting Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (No. 135). I have, &amp;c. V. A. L. MALLET. i Enclosure in No. 1 . Memorandum by Mr. Baggallay respecting a Conversation with the Head of the English Section of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. I * 3 I SPOKE to Sheyesteh on Saturday (26th August) about the question of lights and buoys in the Persian Gulf, explaining that I wished to amplify our note of the 23rd August, which he had just received. 2 . I said that the Foreign Office and other Departments had thought it rather discourteous of the Persian Government to have gone ahead with the inspection of the lights on the Persian coast (and, what w~as worse, on Tamb) without waiting for a reply to the request for guidance to be extended to their newly-engaged expert by the Port of Basra authorities. We had admittedly taken two months to reply, but there was nothing in the original request to indicate that the matter was at all urgent, and in any case the Persian Government had never told us who the expert was. 3 Sheyesteh said that he had passed on to the Ministry of War our enquiry as to the expert’s identity, but the latter had replied that as it was only a question of inspecting lights on Persian territory, the matter was a purely internal one r^ aS scarce ty necessary to &lt;c trouble ” the Legation with the expert’s name. We both agreed that this was a strange reply in view of the previous request for assistance. Sheyesteh said he would gladly tell me who the expert was if he knew himself, but he didn t; he only knew he was a Frenchman. I said it was, no business of ours, but it might be worth ascertaining whether the expert was quite independent or the representative of some construction company, whose main object w onld be contracts. Sheyesteh thought this a great idea. 4. We then got on to the main issue. I explained as well as I could how necessaiy it was for the safety and convenience of the vessels navigating the Gulf mat the navigation guides should be maintained on a uniform system throughout it ' 8 coasts and waters; and that it was for this reason that we were extremely anxious that before putting into effect any recommendations made by their expert,THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT I HAVE the honour to acknowledge receipt of your telegram No. 120 of the 5 th instant on the subject of Per so-Iraqi relations. 2. There is not much that I can add to what I said in my telegram No. 167 of the 8 th August. It is evident that there is a good deal of friction between the two neighbours and, while the Persians are probably the worst offenders, I am not convinced that the Iraq Government could not do more to improve relations than adopt the purely passive attitude which they seem at present to favour. In this connexion I was glad to learn from your despatch No. 258 of the 26th July last that Nouri Pasha has been urged to renew proposals to the Persian Government for the establishment of a tripartite conservancy board for the Shatt-el-Arab. Now that this question has also been broached at the Foreign Office with the Persian Charge d’Affaires, I assume that I am at liberty to mention it to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, if he reverts to the subjects of the Shatt-el-Arab or lighting and buoying of the Persian Gulf. 3 . The Persian press continues, doubtless under official inspiration, to complain of frontier incidents. I have the honour to enclose summaries C) of two recent articles in the Ittela at. 4. The Legation chauffeur tells me that there was a good deal of gossip recently in the coffee-shops about the need for teaching the Iraqis a lesson and that Reza Shah ought to show his strength by annexing Bagdad. It was deduced that King Feisal would not return from Europe, having followed the example of Ahmad Shah, but no doubt His Majesty’s sudden return to Bagdad will have put a stop to such nonsensical talk. 5. 1 will endeavour to keep in touch with the Iraq Minister. He is, I imagine, quite capable of keeping up his end with Feroughi, and although officially their relations must be rather difficult just now 7 , they seem to be personally on the best of terms. 6 .

Presumably, if he retains his present post, it will not be neceeeary to oifer him so high © salary m would be the case if h« confined hla activities to the Conservancy Board. I imagine that after having built up the = ort oi Basra to its present state of high efficiency, he would be rather reluctant to let the control pass into other hands, but you. can probably say what would be his intention, and whether, either on political or administrative grounds, it would be inadvisable that the two appointments should be held by the same man.

Bagdad, November 24, 1932. 1 HAVE the honour to make the following report on the recent visit to Bagdad of Mirza Muhammad Ali Khan Eeroughi, Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs 2 His Highness arrived by motor car from Damascus on the 19th November, and I called on him at the Persian Legation the same evening. g referring briefly to the several questions outstanding between the PpiAan and Iraqi Governments, he led the conversation to the subject of Persian desiderata in the Shatt-al-Arab. He went over the familiar ground cd injustice to Persia of a frontier which placed the whole of the waters of the Shatt under Iraqi sovereignty, and expressed the hope that His Majesty’s Government “ould use their good offices to obtain a rectification of this position which would remove the disabilities from which Persian interests at present suffered. I said that His Majesty’s Government had from the beginning made clear their wi ing- ness to facilitate a settlement of the Shatt-al-Arab question, and it was with that end in view that they had put forward and sponsored the Conservancy Board scheme. I had discussed the principal features of this scheme with His Highness and the Minister of Court when I visited Tehran m April, and Teymourtache had accepted these proposals in principle as forming a satisfactory basis for conclusion of an agreement which would remove Persia s grievance 8 m reg the Shatt. I hoped that there would be an ear jy A fv Board negotiations on these lines, and I was convinced that the Conservancy Board proposals would, in practice, give Persia all that she require . nfficiallv 4. Feroughi said that he was not, of course, discussing th ® An exnlain but merely wished to profit from the opportunity offered y °ur g ^ how anxious the Persian Government were to establish e n ation j n boundary in the Shatt-al-Arab. I again reminded him o , . a y Tehran, in the course of which I had ^explained a r,(\\no-amoiLr- inconsiderate demand to make on a young State, and very vo Inherited from fropre to surrender any part of the sovereign rights w ic - had been the Ottoman Empire, particularly as the boundary m es § before the definitely settled by agreement with the Turkish Goyernme ^ y Ferouffhi Great War in amplification of the terms of the Trea y 0 f Iraa to m ake shrugged his shoulders and said that it should not be ci i , i ^at the concessions to the dignity of a friendly neighbour nieans of living Conservancy Board proposals seemed to me to afior satisfaction to the requirements of both countries. pvpninp- we met .5.

TILE IvLAR INE DEPAR TACiiNT, BOARD OP TRADE, GREAT GEORGE STREET, WESTMINSTER, S.W.l. 13th Octoher, 1932. Dear Rendel, Baker has handed to me your letter of the 11th Octoher (E 4793/147/34), replying to his of the 17th September which was written on my behalf when I was away on leave. I quite agree with the contents of your letter and will await a notification from you when you think the time has come for explaining the position as regards Shatt-el-Arab to the shipowners. I also agree with your view that when the new Advisory Committee is constituted, containing possibly non-British elements as well as British, we can look upon its constitution with equanimity since its function will be purely advisory and related mainly to technical non-political questions. Yours &amp;c., (Signed) C.H.

The papers will be laid before Sir Francis Baghdad. 27th October, 1932. Humphrys as soon as he arrives. The only observations which I have to offer are that I concur entirely in your view that the time is not yet ripe to approach the ship owners with regard to the proposed transfer of the responsibility for the lights and buoys to the Board. I see no reason why an Advisory Committee similar to that now in being at Bombay, representing the same interests and w 7 ith the same functions, should not be set up at Basrah. Such a Committee, although its capacity will be purely advisory, will tend to strengthen the British interest in the Board itself. There should be no great difficulty in securing the consent of the ’Irapi and Persian Governments, as they have no particular interest in tne Lights and Buoys, and have had no measure of control over them hitherto.

Dear Rendel, 1 am wrltingj, in Grimshaw ! s absence, v/ith regard to the scheme to transfer the Persian Gulf lights to the projected Bhatt-el-Arah Conservancy Board, and the need, at some stage or other, for explaining the position to British shipowners* ^You last wrote to Qrimsnaw on this matter on 16th April, and said that when the time eventually came to approach the shipowners, it would he 'best for the Board of Trade to take the necessary action* Bryant has reported to me y/hst you said to him at the meeting on 15th September - to the effect that the proposed Treaty cannot yet he mentioned to the Shipowners' Associations, and I quite recognise the necessity of keeping important Treaty negotiations of this kind entirely secret* The need for telling the shipowners 'beforehand what is being done depends, t/O some extent, on whether they will have an Advisory Committee under the new system, as they have at present* The matter is one of real importance, as the principle has been fully admitted in connection with Lighthouse administration in this country that, as British shipowners are the largest contributors to the ilmd resulting from the light dues, they should have a voice as regards the expenditure - especially on net' worxs* it is the old principle of taxation and representation going together.

My dear Young, I enclose a copy of a letter from Balter of the Mercantile Marina department of the board of irade, in which he ask© that Humphry s i attention should be drawn to the importance of having, as at present, an Advisory Committee on which British shipowners will he represented, after the Persian Half lights have been handed over to the proposed hhatt-el-Arab Conservancy Board. I also enclose a copy of my reply. arb is, I understand, fully aware of the composition and functions of the Advisory committee uauer the present system. Briefly, the Committee, which at present sits at Bombay, consists of one representative of eacn of the following bodies? The British India Steam navigation Company * The Bombay Persia etesm Navigation Company The /uaglo-Persian Oil Company. Messrs. F*C* Strick and company, Condon. The Sir H. Young, G.M.Gh, B.8.0.The Bombay Chamber of Commerce. The Bombay Underwriters* Association* The British Tanker Company* The Sur&amp;ah-uhell oil Storage and Distributing Company of India* This Advisory Committee has a purely non~ofiicial character* It is however, supplied by the oovcrnment of India with the fullest pOBSlbie information about the lighting and buoying service and the expenditure upon it, and is given every opportunity oi suggesting economies and improvements in administration* If and when the Conservancy Board takes over the lighting ana huaying of the Gulf, it ■«•** clear that this Advisory Committee will have to change its headquarters to Basra. I understand that all the British shipping lines trading in the aulf have their represwitativea at oasra, and that the change over iron Bombas' to Basra is not H’xely to have any practical arswbeeks. 1’he present Advisory Committee is, of course, purely British, ana it nay eventually he necessary' to arrange for other non-British elements to he represented on it.

Present: yr.Rendel, Foreign Office.(in the chair) ^ir r. Humphry. Mr. Hall, Colonial Office. Mr. Baxter, Foreign Office. (1) £TJ£mTO f or propose^ norotlatlnnn . Sir F. Humphry® explained his view with regard to the procedure to be followed during the forthcoming negotiations. His idea was that, in the first place the Iraqi Government would Invite the Persian Govern ment to send a negotiator to Bagdad to trv to reach a settlement of all the questions outstanding between the two Governments. This had already been provisionally arranged, and the Persian negotiator was, he believed, to be the Persian Minister of Justice. hhen this Persian negotiator had arrived, the Iraqi Government ought then to invite him, Sir F. Humph rye, to take part officially in the negotiations in so far as they affected the Shatt-el-Arab. Sir F. Humphrys anticipated that the negotiations would last for some weeks, and that eventually something like a deadlock would be reached. He would then propose, at what he considered to be the 1 psychological moment but not before, to send a private telegram, through Mr. Hoare, to Teymourt&amp;che, reminding the latter of their previous conver tion on the subject and Inviting Teymourtache, in accordance with a sugges tion already made to him, to visit Iraq and go for a two days* yachting trip as the guest of Sir F.Humphrvs Ri f5U - ^ in tihe Shatt-el-Arab itself and the northern end of the Persian Gulf. There was a good chance, he felt sure, that Teyraourtache, if onlv he could he got into the right mood, would he ready to sign,for the final settlement of this long outstanding dispute would he a considerable personal triumph for himself. The programme sug ested b-” Sir F.Humnhrys was provisionally agreed to. (2) Chairmanship of Conservancy Board . Sir F, Humphry* then explained the reasons for which he had been unable to agree with certain of the views expressed at the full meeting that morning. In the first place, it had been suggested that the British representative on the Board might be a retired British Naval officer. This would, in Sir F. Humphrys’ opinion, be open to strong objection, as it would arouse the suspicions of both Iraqis and Persians, who would conclude that the British Admiralty was trying to get control of the Board for strategic reasons. On the contrary, it was essential that the British representative should be appointed purely for his technical qualifications and should have nothing to do with either politics or naval affairs. Sir F. Humph rys considered that probably the only really suitable appointment would be that of Colonel Ward, the present Basra Port Director. Colonel Hard was persona grata to both Iraqis and Persians. Bis technical knowledge and administrative ability were fully e recognised loyally, and he was known to have nothing to do with politics. Sir F. Humphry* explained that it would ..•would be of Ihe utmost Importance to him in the negotiations to be able to say definitely that Colonel Ward would be the British representative on the Board for the first few years. He was convinced that, if only he could assure the Iraqis and Persians of this, there would be little difficulty in getting them to agree that Colonel Ward should be the Chairman and Executive Officer for the first ten years of the Board's existence, during which it seemed absolutely essential, if the Conservancy Scheme was to work at all well, that the British member should be able to manage the whole of the Board's affairs. But if the relevant provision of the Convention was merely nemlsslve - l.e, if it were laid down only that the Board miidit appoint one of its members to be executive officer - the Persian and Iraqi members might well contrive to secure the appointment, not of the British irieMier of the Board, who alone would possess the necessary qualifications, but of a paid servant of the Board possible of other nationality. Colonel Ward, however, would never agree to accept the appointment of British representative on the Con servancy Board, unless he could be assured that he would in practice manage the af fairs of the Board during the whole period of his appointment. Sir F. Humph rye there fore felt stronglv that Article 5, paragraph 1 of the draft Convention should run somewhat as follows:- 'The Board shall. mri n the first ten yearn.pr delegate to one of Its members the nower of exercising executive * ♦ •executive functions in the intervals between meetings.* Mr.Hendel agreed generally with Sir F. Humphrys* views, altliough he personally would have preferred to say, 'during at least the first five years of ite existence', and undertook that his suggestion for the amendment of Article 5, paragraph 1, of the Convention would be sympathetically examined. It was agreed that the Foreign Office would forth with take the necessary sV ps to secure the concurrence of the other Departments concerned in the proposal that Colonel Ward should be asked to be the first British member of the proposed Shaft-el-Arab Conservancy Board, and that, if he accepted, Sir F. Humphrvs should be authorised to inform the Iraqis and Persians of the proposed appointment at whatever moment in the negotiations he thought suitable* FOREIGN OFFICE, 17th September, 1932. ___on tms SUUJBUU, I o.

Sir I am directed dy Secretary Sir John Simon to transmit to you, for the consideration of the Secretary of State for India, the accompanying copy of a letter sent to the Board of Trade on the 29th September regarding the proposal that Colonel Ward, the present Director of the Port of Basra, should now he offered the appointment of British Member on the proposed Shatt~el-A ra b Conservancy Board in the event of the successful outcome of the forthcoming negotiations with the Iraqi and Persian Governments on this question. Similar letters were addressed on the same date to the Treasury, Colonial Office and Admiralty. 2. I am to enquire whether Sir Samuel Hoare is prepared to agree to the course of action suggested in paragraph 5 of the enclosed letter. 3. Copies of this letter are being sent to the Board of Trade, Treasury, Colonial Office and Admiralty. I am Sir, Your obedient Servant, lie Under-Secretary of State Indiaopy E 4792/20/34) n r\ ^ o 7 * ^ o FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l. 29th September, 1932* Important, Sir, I am directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to inform you that he has recently received from Sir Francis Humphrys, His Majesty* s High Commissioner for Iraq, a strong recommendation that Colonel Ward, the present Director of the Port of Basra, should now be offered the appointment of British member on the proposed Shatt-el-Arab Conservancy Board in the event of the successful outcome of the forthcoming negotiations with the Iraqi and Persian Governments on this question. 2. Sir Francis Humphrys has represented the extreme importance, in the interests of the efficient working of the whole Conservancy Board scheme, of ensuring that the British member, who alone is likely to possess the necessary technical qualifications, shall exercise during the first few years of the Board’s existence the functions of its principal executive officer* The Iraqi and Persian Governments appear to realise that it will be impossible at present for them to appoint a representative of their own nationality with the required experience of navigation and conservancy work, but they are nevertheless unlikely to agree to the delegation of full executive functions to the British member, unless the personality of that member is such as to inspire them with complete confidence They may otherwise press that full executive functions should be entrusted fee Secretary to the Board of Trade*4 . entrusted to a subordinate official of other than British nationality. The selection of a suitable British representative on the Board is therefore a matter of considerable importance. Sir Francis Humphrys would deprecate the appoint ment of a Britisn official who, in the opinion of the Iraqi and Persian Governments might be liable to be influenced by political considerations, and the same objection would apply to the appointment of a retired naval officer, whom the Persian and Iraqi Governments, would almost certainly suspect of being under the influence of the Admiralty and of thus aiming at securing for His Majesty’s Government, for strategic reasons, an excessive degree of control over the Board’s affairs. Such suspicions can be averted only if the Britisn member is known to be a technical expert, unconnected in any way with political questions• 3, Sir Francis Humphrys feels that by far the most suitable appointment would be that of the present Basra Port Director. Colonel Ward may, he states, be regarded as persona gra ta to both the Iraqi and Persian Governments. He is known to them as a capable and trustworthy technical expert, entirely uninfluenced by political motives, who has a thorough experience of local conditions extending over a period of more than twelve years, and he has during that time built up a highly efficient administration which has long discharged in a satisfactory manner the very functions to be entrusted in future to the proposed Conservancy Board. Sir Francis Humphrys considers, indeed, that the proposed appointment of Colonel Card would!tself, in Iraqi and Persian eyes, go far to justify British representation on the Board, the necessity for which might during the negotiations be called in question.4. In order that full advantage may be taken during the forthcoming negotiations of Colonel Ward's proposed appointment, Sir irancis Humphrys wishes to be assured in advance that it will be acceptable to Hjs Majesty's Government* 5. I am therefore to enquire whether the Board of Trade are prepared to agree to the proposal that Colonel Wgrd should be asked to be the first British member of the proposed Shatt- el-Arab Conservancy Board should the Convention be concluded, and that, if he accepts the proposed appointment, Sir Francis Humphrys should be authorised to inform the Iraqi and Persian negotiators of this at whatever stage of the negotiations may appear to him appropriate. 6.

But I should have thought that there was something to he said for letting the Resident know that this tour is in contemplation. We are not at all anxious to interest the Persians in what is going on in the Arab States, and to prevent any local misunderstanding I might perhaps suggest to Mr. Bendel that the Resident should he told what is going on and given an opportunity to comment if he so desires. u X-(E 4791/20/34) Dear Crombie, I enclose a summary of the conclusions reached at the meeting held here at 12 o’clock on September 15th to discuss the Shatt-el-Arab Conservancy Board proposals.
