There are also reports from some of the surrounding corn growing districts of famine and disease being rife and that even with some good fortune and rain production is anticipated to be seventy-five percent less than in previous years.Malcolm also reports that the famine is likely to impact the area most during the forthcoming winter and that the local government is making the collection of relief funds difficult and that the only aid available in Bushire is the funds distributed by the Residency.Trade in Bushire is reported as being stagnant and its recovery reliant on the country's agriculture reviving.The letter also relates news of the governance of Bushire; an outbreak of Cholera in Bunder Abbas [Bandar-e-Abbas]; and regarding the care of Pelly's garden during his absence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024376733.0x000023#share">Creative Commons Attribution Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
