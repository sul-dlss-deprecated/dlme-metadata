B. 242. SECRET. TERRITORIAL READJUSTMENTS. Extract from Secret Letter from the Government No. 85, dated 29th September 191G. of India, Jn our Foreign Department secret telegram of the 7th September 19Jf&gt; we had the honour to submit a summary of our views on the points raised in your telegram of the 21st August 1916 in connection with the post bellum disposal of captured territories. It was, however, obviously impossible for us within the compass of a telegram to state fully our provisional views on these important questions. We shall accordingly in this despatch endeavour to state in extenso our opinions— (1) Regarding the surrender or retention of such captured territories as affect Indian interests. (2) Regarding obsolete Treaty rights and territorial readjustments vis-d-vis our Allies. (M) Regarding the proposed readjustment of the boundary of the Aden Protectorate and our future policy generally in that neighbourhood. 1 Enclosure to letter No. 22, dated the 1st June 1916, from the Secretary, Political Department, India Office. 2. As regards the first point, viz., the question of the retention or surrender of captured territories or territories likely to be captured, the only territories of this kind that affect Indian interests are, we think, Iraq and German East Africa. In regard to the former, wo understand from the memorandum prepared by the Foreign Office in May 1 1916, that an agreement has been concluded between Great Britain, France and Russia respecting Asiatic Turkey whereby a definite area, comprising the Basrah and Baghdad Vilayats, has been assigned to Great Britain, wherein “Great Britain shall be allowed to “ establish such direct or indirect administration or control as it desires and “ as it may think fit to arrange with the Arab State or confederation of Arab “ States.” We conclude, therefore, that this area is to be retained by Great Britain under either direct or indirect administration, and that there is no question of surrendering it for purposes of bargaining either with our Allies or with the enemy, and we trust that we are correct in this conclusion. It is unnecessary here to put forward any suggestions as to the form or forms of administration eventually to be established in this area, as such suggestions would be alien to the present discussion. But as Indian interests—political, commercial and military—must be intimately affected by the eventual decision on this point, we trust we shall be fully consulted before such decision is arrived at. As regards German East Africa, that territory has been regarded in many quarters here as offeiing fin .admirable field for Indian expansion, and hopes have been expressed that, whatever may be the future administration of that country, arrangements will be made to admit ol Indian emigration on equitable terms. Similar hopes have been expressed in regard to Iraq, but we foresee that there may be serious drawbacks in connection with the idea of Indian colonisation in that region. This makes it the more important that Indian expansion should find an outlet in German East Africa. India’s needs in this respect have already been felt and will be felt more acutely in futuie. The provision of such a field of expansion would go far to solve some of the existing problems with regard to our surplus population. We trust this opportunity may not be let slip. No other territory is so suitable for Indian colonisation, none other so convenient of access, and there is already a considerable Indian population settled in the vicinity. We are not in a position to make any representation as to the future disposal or administra tion of German East Africa, but we most earnestly trust that this matter will be pressed and that the claims of India to the widest colonisation rights in what is now German East Africa will be strongly urged. S 3302 Turning to the second point, viz., the question of obsolete Treaty rights and territorial readjustments vis-a-vis our Allies, we think that it will be most convenient to consider our desiderata vis-a-vis each in turn as follows. 4. France. —The matters in which we are mainly interested, so far as France is concerned, may be summarised as follows :— (а) The French possessions in India and the Treaties of extradition connected therewith. (б) The Treaties connected with Maskat. (cj The French claim to Sheikh Said and Southern Arabia generally. (d) The arms traffic at Jibouti. As regards (a), llis Majesty’s Government are aware that we have for many years past desired the extinction of French territorial rights in India. French territory, particularly Chandernagore, has been for many years past a base for revolutionary propaganda and revolutionary conspiracies. It is unnecessary for us here to elaborate this point, which has formed the subject of considerable separate correspondence. We fully realize, however, that it may be very difficult to secure the complete extinction of the French Empire in India, but we trust that, should complete extinction be impossible, as suggested in paragraph 7 of the India Office memorandum, dated 20th April 1015, every endeavour may be made to induce the French Government to accept in exchange for Chandernagore and the other Settle ments and luges, with the exception of Pondicherry, territorial compensation adjoining Pondicherry. If the French possessions in India could be reduced to an enlarged but compact Pondicherry with a reasonably rectified frontier, we should, we think, have much less trouble in the future. With the centre of anarchism and revolutionary crime in Bengal and with no likelihood, so far as we can see, of its being transferred to Madras, it seems obvious that if there must be an Alsatia for political criminals and fraudulent debtors in India it is much better that it should be in Pondicherry than anywhere in Bengal. It is more remote and the surrounding country is less sympathetic. Its approaches could be more easily watched and guarded and the interests of a larger, more important and doubtless better governed French dependency would discourage the influx of bad characters. It is not improbable that the French Government may, however, demand more than mere territorial com pensation lor the proposed arrangement and they may conceivably hark back to die question of our extradition rights based on the Treaties of 1815 and I^7b. In this connection we would invite attention to our despatch No. 107 (Secret—General) of the 4th August 1910. We think that as suggested there we might well agree to the modification, at any rate so far as political offences are concerned, of Article 10 of the Treaty of 1876 as pait consideration for the concessions made by France in a general scheme of ireadjustment. At the same time if we are to agree to exclude political offences from the operation of the Treaties of 1815 and 1876, w'e are strongly of opinion that more serious crimes, such as would affect the sa ety of oui common interests in India, should be exempted from the eategoiy of political offences, these should include, if possible, waging wai, se&lt; ucing troops, murder of officials or instigation thereto and offences aganist t ie explosives Act. It would no doubt bS desirable also to include ic - j ms - - t, mt if the Trench have no corresponding prohibition of their own icie vi piobabK be little chance of their agreeing to this. ^ 8 iega!(. s (o), the Maskat 1 reaties.

As legards (&lt;), we had no idea whatever until we received a copy of the lv , , v —1 1 , India Office letter, No. P. 4709—14 1 of Lnclosure to letter &gt;io. ol. dated the ii + i iv . ± 18th December 1914 fr om tile Secretary, J ^ llth Ifcember ]!,1 I to the Foreign Political Department, India Office. ‘ihce, and the connected papers that the Prench laid claim in any shape or form to Sheikh Said or the western portion of Arabia. We trust that steps may be taken to make it clear that His Majesty’s Government have never recognised and can never recognise the claims of the Societe Guest Asiatique or any other French claims in that region. As regards (d), the arms trade at Jibouti, this matter has already formed the subject of correspondence between Cairo and the Foreign Office (vide „ „ , , ^ Cairo’s despatch to Sir E. Grey, - Enclosure to letter No. 26, dated the No . ] ] 9,2 dated 24th May 1910) and w r e need only say that w r e trust that some efficient arrangement may be made whereby Jibouti may be prevented from becoming in the Red Sea what Maskat was in the Persian Gulf. We regard this matter as of the inmost importance. 0. Italy .—So far as Indian interests are concerned, Italy’s ambitions in the direction of the Eastern Littoral of the Red Sea, particularly in the direction of the Yemen, are disquieting. It v^as owing to apprehension regarding her ambitions in this direction that on the entry of Italy as our ally into the war we w 7 ere at once forced to take military action in the form of the occupation of certain islands in the Red Sea —action we should not otherwise have taken—in order to prevent Italy from establishing a claim in this region. The question of Aden will be discussed in a later paragraph, and. the policy we recommend will be stated, but the policy so indicated is contingent on the absence of any European Power from the region of Southern Arabia. The vdiole political and military situation in the Aden protectorate and the Hadramaut would be revolutionised if a European Power obtained a foothold in the Yemen or indeed anywhere on the Arabian Littoral. Indeed our policy in regard to Arabia must perforce be of the nature of a Monroe doctrine. We earnestly hope, therefore, that in return for compensation elsewhere an understanding may be arrived at with the Italian Government whereby she will admit that the Red Sea islands and Western and Southern Arabia are outside the sphere of her interests and influence. A subsidiary point in regard to Italy is the arms traffic in the Red Sea. We understand that His Majesty’s Government have already this matter under consideration, and that the 2 Vide enclosure to letter No. 28, dated Eoreign Office have addressed 3 His omce 8 *''*” 7. Majesty's Ambassador at Home on the subject. All we need do here is to express a hope that a satisfactory arrangement may be effected which will prevent Italian territorv on the Red Sea from affording facilities to the arms traffic. 29tli June 191d, from the Secretary, Political Department, India Office.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000265_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/18/B242</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000265</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/18/B242</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'Territorial re-adjustments.
