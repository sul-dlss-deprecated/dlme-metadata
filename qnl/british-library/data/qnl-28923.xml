Proposals (3) Basrah Tramways; (4) site for refinery; (5) and (G) water \ supply ; (8) water supply and electric light. All approved. Proposal (2). Pulp concession not approved. Proposal (10).

Copy of a m,mo Ho. H.l/2/25 dated 3rd January 1919 , from the Executive Snginear. Civil Works, Baghdad, to the Qivil Commissioner, Baghdad# m*K. Reference your No.37607 of 17*12-19* I send herewith plans showing the layout of Alwiyeh, 2he small scale plan shows roughly the main lines ot the complete scheme, linked up with the Military Cantonment of Hinaidi* 2he large scale plan shows the more complete development of the xye ground available at present* She outlines of the eoheme is briefly as follows;* One main traffic road will run from Baghdad city to Hinaidi Cantonment, through centres marked C.B. and A* A tramway is proposed on this road, which will be the main traffic road of the town and to the cantonment* It is aligned to take the minaret and domes of the mosque of Abdul A&amp;dir Kilani in the far distance at one end, and can be broken by features at points C &amp; A* point rt C' will be a business centre of the town for suoh build* ings as Workshops, Stores, Garages, etc., Midway between 0 &amp; 3 the road will pass through the market or shopping area which is within easy raaoh of the main residential area* Buropean shops and a well built, covered bazaar will be erected here. Point '3' is a centre in the residential area for middle class Buropean houses point 'A* is the real centre of the whole town, and, as it is on the other main central road, this point of intersec tion has been designed as a focal point for radiating roads, and should be treated in a broad and architectural manner. I suggest that the central plot No*295 be reserved for a large monumental building or memorial, surrounded by gardens in plots Ifos«291, 292, 293, 294, 304 , 305,306 and 307, and encircled by the largest houses, probably wealthy and representative shaikhs will desire sites for4 8 3 ^ houaes, and x suggest that those sites be reserved for such purposes. The second main road runs from the river at point 'H” through point 'A' to point 'K' on Abuharmel mounds* Between point w H w t and the river at point I have reserved a large plot of ground t Ho.7 for Govern ment House and Gardens* Point W L' will be the centre of the dome or main architectural feature of Government House. This point will be a vista terminal for several roads* Around Point ,f H w I have laid out a large 'place** and from there to point 'A”, I suggest a broad avenue laid out with avenues and gardens (plots Uos*296,297). This will be the main ceremonial road of the town, on each side of this road, in plots Hos*18, 19, 308, I suggest the Secretariat Offices and Army Headquarters, supporting in architectural composition the Government House. Between these offices and the Point 'A', the largest and best houses for senior officials should be erected. At point 'X 1 *, on the Abuharmal mounds, I suggest that a large park with public gardens and playing fields, should be made* Prom point 'A*, I have radiated several roads to the Military Gantonment and also to the various ceu-cres of the town through the residentAAl area* Point the railway station from which another system of radiating roads start. On the large scale plan I have shown bj a green line the boundary of tfaqf land, by red- the boundary of Government land* For the present portion of the scheme and, until considerable development takes place, no private land will be required. Buildings erected by private individuals on such land must, however, be carefully controlled, so as to conform with the complete scheme. I have divided the whole area into building aites and arranged my roads and servioe roads to suit. n h9 3 ites are roughly graded into 1st class. 2nd classand third olass, aooording to size, aituaticn , ato Most of those sites shown on the plan are reserved for Sovernaent Houses, Offlees, eto., but a certain number of each class will be available for private individuals Aoout 30 sites for houses have already been applied for. 18 sio&amp;ll houses have been built since the work was started last July, on plots Uo.62,63, 64,65,66,76, 80,81,82,83,84,65, and a large olub house is under o on at motion at plot Iio.5, and should be completed about the end of April# It is the intention to make the olub a residential one, and it has been designed on suoh lines* I am at present designing quarters for bachelor and married officers, which will be erected on sites kos* 12,13 during next building season* I also intend to prepare designs for about 25 bungalows which I will endeavour to erect next year# I will submit at a later date a definite building programme •several new roads must also be cut and the matters of irrigation, water supply and electric lighting gardens, avenues, drainage, etc; all require consider- ation as a large amount of this work must be put in hand soon# These plans I now send you are not complete# I am at present working up a complete plan which I wish to have reproduced but I wish to give several matters more consideration and dont want to 'rush' them# As soon as I possibly can, I will let you have the complete scheme* I think however that the plans I now send you, will show roughly , what has been done and the lines on which I wish to work#f / ir | q 4'* Q All further communications on this subject should be addressed to — The Secretary, War Office, London, S.W.l. and the following number quoted.
