Hopwood to Sir F. Mallet.—(Received July 29.) My dearMaliet, . I THINK it is impracticable at this stage to enter into any definite, understanding with McLeod, and it is important not to allow the matter to be hurried from that side. It is necessary to keep in mind that McLeod’s interests and his views of the Anglo-Persian position are naturally those of the Anglo-Saxon Company, of which he is a director. It is only by accident that he has become aware of the nature of the Admiralty negotiations with the Anglo-Persian Company, and it is desirable that our relations with and intentions in regard to that company should not be discussed When we made our recent contract with the “ Shell” we informed McLeod that the D’Arcv croup had been supported in respect of Mesopotamia for at least four years past—done before the Anglo-Saxon Company showed any interest in that region. Supplies from Mesopotamia are not included in the Admiralty contract with the Our negotiations with the Anglo-Persian Company are still in progress, and have not yet reached a final stage. i 1 , . , , ,, T I may mention in confidence (and particularly not to be mentioned to McLeod) that the Admiralty contemplate as a preliminary step the sending out of an expert committee to examine the Persian fields. We shall no doubt write officially to the Foreign Office in due course on that point. McLeod’s scheme of directors is altogether illusory. He appears to assume that Anglo-Persian (two),National Bank (two),and “Shell” (one) representatives—five British subfects—would necessarily act together, and that Anglo-Saxon (one) and Deutsche Bank (two) would be foreigners, or under foreign control, and, therefore, might foim a minority of three. In actual fact, as National Bank and “ Shell” have an understanding with one another, and their only claim to come in is, vi&amp;_, the Deutsche Bank, the actual working group would no doubt be— Six, viz., Deutsche Bank, “Shell” and Anglo-Saxon, and National Bank. Two Anglo-Persian. We have understood from recent correspondence and meeting at the Board of Trade that the National Bank may drop out. Is not the first step to determine that point ? If they do not act with the independent British company it is not much good their remaining in from the Admiralty point of view, but there may be Foreign Office reasons for not excluding them. ...... If the National Bank drop out, the Anglo-Saxon, who came in at their invitation, will obviously be in a different position. In these circumstances it seems to us that support to D Arcy should be steadily continued till a reasonable agreement is in sight; that negotiations should be directed to securing that at least half of the directors shall represent British interests who might reasonably be expected to work together ; that the mam lines of contiol of the working of the field and of marketing shall be settled, if practicable, by agreement beforehand. On both these last matters there is no doubt much room for give and take and the Admiralty does not intend to support any unreasonable claim. McLeod’s offer in regard to the fuel oil—an option to buy “ surplus available for export ” is not worth much. I think you are aware that the Germans wish to secure something like 40 per cent, of the fuel oil for German markets apart from local requirements. . Yours sincerely, FRANCIS J. S.

Section 1. [38738] T TP 3 kj a 191 //C (« 29 [Amended Copy.] ^ 1. 9. -«* Minute by Mr. Parker. HERR von KUEHLMANN called to-day to speak to me about tlie Mesopotamian oil con- cession. He said that he had heard from Herr von Gwinner, who said he feared it would be impossible for him to free himself from Ins contractual obligations to the Shell Company. Personally Herr von Gwinner had no marked preference for the Shell Company, but what had happened was this : Herr von Gwinner, in the desire of reaching an agreement with the English, had approached Sir E. Cassel (the National Bank of Turkey). Someone in the National Bank of Turkey had first brought forward the idea of an arrangement with the Shell Company, and an arrangement had subsequently been formally concluded, by which, so it appeared, the National Bank received 50 per cent, in the New Company, the Shell Company 25 per cent., and the Deutsche Bank 25 per cent. . . Under clause 36 a of the articles of association it was laid down that, if one of the three parties withdrew, the shares of that party should be offered first to the other two parties: if, there fore, Herr von Gwinner had pointed out, the National Bank withdrew, the effect would be to increase the holding of the Shell Company. It was accordingly undesirable that the National Bank should go out. I said to Herr von Kuehlmann that this was based on the assumption that the New Company held a valid and undisputed title to what it claimed. He was already aware that His Majesty’s Government, just as much as the German Government, were anxious to avoid, dealing with this question in a contentious spirit, and to reach an acceptable arrangement for the future rather than to waste time on an examination of the past. But if it became a question of whether or not the Shell could be ousted, assuming such a consummation, for t e sake of argument, to be desirable, then there was [1825 w—1] B C $2 some advantage in examining how far the title of the New Company, or the trio, was valid and undisputed. That title consisted in (&lt;x) certain rights, limited by the fact that they were expressly stated not to constitute “ a privilege or a monopoly,” and by the fact that they only extended for 20 kilom. on each side of the Bagdad Railway in so far as that railway might pass through petroliferous districts, and (b) certain claims. The rights were derived under article 22 of the Bagdad Railway Convention of March 1903. The claims rested upon the convention concluded by the Anatolian Railway Company with the Civil List in 1904. That convention, both in the view of the legal advisers of the Sublime Porte, and in the opinion of the legal advisers of the Foreign Office, had lapsed, and it appeared clear that no claim under it would lie in a Court of Law. Herr von Kuehlmann admitted that the rights of the New Company rested upon these two instruments, but he said that the Company had, he understood, taken legal advice which tended to support the view that the convention of 1904 w^ still valid. I said that at any rate the validity was disputed, and the prospects were that, in the absence of an agreement acceptable both to Germany and to Great Britain, there would be no satisfactory settlement and a good deal of ill-feeling which it was most desirable to avoid. If, therefore, the presence of the Shell Company had the practical effect of blocking the concession, except in so far as any rights of the Bagdad Railway Company under the convention of 1903 were concerned, it would do itself no good by adopting a dog-in- the-manger attitude, and refusing either to be easily bought out or to accept reasonable terms. I made it clear that I was not pressing that the Shell Company should go out, but the point I did want to make was that the Shell Company did not really dominate the situation, for it could hardly persist m its claims under any agreement made with Herr von Gwinner, if such persistence ren dered the New Company paralytic. Such beimr the logic of the situation, Herr von Gwinner seemed to be m a position of vantage for exer cismg suasion upon the Shell Company v!r then n-?n rred t0 the POSition of Anglo- T Tr 1 , C ° mpany ’ as ^Presenting Mr. d’Arcy I said that his Company had applied for, and been promised, the diplomatic support of His Majesty’s3 Government many years ago, and long before the National Bank or the Shell Company had appeared on the scene. This company, in the person of Mr. d’Arcy, had received the most definite pro mises from two Grand Viziers that the oil con cession for the vilayets of Mosul and Bagdad would be granted to them; it had been encouraged to keep an agent for many years in Constantinople, and His Majesty’s Government, while they might perhaps induce the Anglo-Persian Company to forgo its well-founded claim to the whole concession, if satisfactory terms were arranged, could not equitably, and did not desire to, abandon those who had first obtained their support. Herr von Kuehlmann asked me what arrange ment I thought would be satisfactory to His Majesty’s Government. I said that this depended to some extent upon whether or not the Shell Company was to remain in the combination, and if so what percentage it was to hold. The principal objects of His Majesty’s Government were (a) to maintain the independence of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, as they were opposed to the creation of large trusts, {h) to secure satis factory marketing arrangements, (c) to secure an abundant supply of oil at a reasonable price, and (d) to support the Anglo-Persian Oil Company m what they considered to be a just and well- established claim to the concession. It was difficult to discuss percentages, control, and marketing arrangements without expert knowledge, but I felt confident that anything short of 60 per cent, would not be regarded as adequate for the Anglo-Persian Company. If that were conceded, I thought that an arrange ment which made fair allowance for the interests of all concerned in the products ought to be practicable ; but I thought it would be difficult to advance towards agreement until the Shell Company came to a proper sense of its own weak position in regard to Mesopotamia. I urged that Herr von Gwinner should be asked to put forward, through Herr von Kuehlmann, proposals which would be acceptable to him, and then a discussion could begin to some purpose. I gave Herr von Kuehlmann a copy of this memorandum for his confidential use, and he said he would communicate further with Herr von Gwinner. He left with me the attached papers. A. P. Foreign Office, August 20, 1913.4 Annex. (i.) Communicated confidentially by Herr von Kuehlmann, August 20, 1913. The Turkish Petroleum Company (Limited), London. Dear Sirs, Beidin, October 19, 1912. WE hereby undertake that we will not directly or indirectly be interested in the production or manufacture of crude oil in the Turkish Empire in Europe and Asia apart from our interest in the Turkish Petroleum Company (Limited). It will, however, be understood that this obligation will in no case interfere with our ordinary banking transactions. Furthermore, it will be understood that all parties participating in the company mentioned will be at liberty to import crude oil into Turkey and refine it there so long as the said company has not found oil in Turkey in workable quantities, but that, if the company begins working oil, it wall then have the option of buying any refineries established there by any of the parties at cost price less amortisation.

IN reply to your letter of tlie 15th August, we have heard nothing at the Foreign Office of an intended conference in which the several interests in the Mesopotamian question would be represented. The matter is very complicated, but w r e do not feel that, at this moment, a conference would help much towards a settlement; and the Foreign Office, as you know, are pledged to support the Anglo-Persian Company, as having been the first comers. But the Foreign Office are really in this matter little more than a channel of com munication. The Departments principally concerned are the Admiralty and the Board of Trade, and especially the former. I should therefore advise you to thrash matters out with the Admiralty, the Foreign Office being deficient in the necessary technical knowledge. Many thanks for your kind congratulations.

I HA’V E the honour to transmit to you herewith copies of four documents which, I think, will be read with interest, as showing that the Turkish Ministry of Mines considers that the Anatolian Railway Company’s rights to the petroleum concession in the vilayets of Bagdad and Mosul have lapsed. The documents are (1) a petition from the Anatolian Railway Company to the Ministry of Mines insisting on the company’s right of preference under the Zander contract of 1904, (2) another petition from the same company requesting that the “permis de recherches ” granted to two Ottoman subjects in the vilayet may be with drawn, as being in violation of the company’s rights, (3) and (4) the minutes in translation made at the Ministry of Mines on (1) and (2). It will be seen in No. 3 that it is stated that the cancellation of the Zander contract was notified to the railway company on the 22nd December (4th January), 1906, and confirmed again on the 4th March following, on each occasion by the Civil List, and that the Ministry of Finance has made a similar declaration to the company. I have not been able to ascertain yet whether replies in the sense of these minutes have been sent to the company. I understand that the “ permis de recherches ” held by the Turkish subjects above mentioned are in order, and that at the end of the year they applied for and obtained the usual extension of one year, which will expire next month, when it is supposed that they will apply for the requisite firmans for the definite concessions. They have already sent a civil engineer to Kerkuk to draw up a plan of the claims. It is said further that they are in negotiation with a British firm which is prepared to take up the scheme as soon as the firmans are issued. It is difficult to see how the issue of the firmans could be prevented, as all the necessary formalities have been gone through. The certainty that we may now be said to possess as to the present valueless character of the Zander contract in the eyes of the Turkish Ministry of Mines should be useful in bringing the National Bank group to terms with Mr. D’Arcy.

Board of Trade to Foreign Office.—(Received August 9.) (Secret.) Sir, Board of Trade, August 8, 1913. I AM directed by the Board of Trade to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 1st August, from which they understand that Sir Edward Grey desires to have the views of this Department, after consultation with the Admiralty, as to the maximum and minimum requirements to be insisted upon by His Majesty’s Government with regard to the proposed oil concession in Mesopotamia. In reply, I am to state that the maximum requirements of His Majesty’s Govern ment, in the interests both of the navy and of British trade, are naturally that the concession should be given as promised by two Grand Viziers to Mr. D’Arcy or his assignees. The Board, however, presume that this course is not considered practicable, and they pass, therefore, to the question of minimum requirements. As regards the latter, the Board desire me to point out that, from the nature of the case, no minimum requirements can be stated wdthout reference to a number of conditions, some of which are very imperfectly known, e.g., the degree of the danger that the concession may be given without our consent to some foreign combination, the composition of the body to which it is likely that the concession may be granted, and the mutual relations of the different elements which compose that body. It follows, therefore, that any detailed proposal based upon existing data for the solution of this difficult problem must be in the highest degree tentative and provisional, since, as soon as negotiations are effectively begun, it is probable that some of the assumptions on which the sch§|§Bge is based will be found to be unwarranted. Subject to the above consideration! I am to say that, so far as the Board are able to judge, the essential points to be kept in mind, from the point of view of British interests, are as follows :— 1. The desire of the Admiralty to secure supplies of fuel oil from the Mesopotamian oil-fields, with the minimum risk that that supply may fail them in time of war or of strained relations 2. The desire of the Admiralty for other reasons to preserve the independence of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, and with that object to prevent any company con nected with the Shell combination from using the supplies of oil obtained from the Mesopotamian oil-fields to undersell the Anglo-Persian Company in the Middle Eastern markets, which it has ’made peculiarly its own, thus forcing the company to choose between ruin and absorption into their system. # rvi rr It is believed, further, that the independence of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company is also an object of solicitude with the Foreign Office in connection with theii general policy in Persia ; but the Board of Trade are not clear as to the precise weight attached by the Foreign Office to this consideration. . 3. The general desire of His Majesty’s Government to support British enterprise, and in particular the obligation of the Foreign Office to fulfil any promise of support given by them to Mr. D’Arcy and his assignees. Taking the above points in order. As regards (1), it seems to the Board that, m ordinary times of peace, the object of the Admiralty would be sufficiently at amed by an option on fuel oil up to a sufficient amount, or proportion of the total output. In time of war or of strained relations, however, such an option might become valueless^ and in these circumstances the Board consider that the only possible security that t e , fuel oil shall reach the navy in time of strained relations is the predominance on the board of the company of British directors, who in such times will, m the last resort, obey the instructions of His Majesty’s Government on matters of vital importance to Imperial safety and defence. It also seems necessary that this predominance on the directorate of the company should be coupled with such marketing arrangements as will ensure that the oil destined for the use of the British navy will actually be aval- able for that purpose, and not be diverted by middlemen to other destinations. n [1825 2] _ _ _ . _ J -I \ r2 s other words, the marketing arrangements, so far as the oil supplies of the British Admiralty are concerned, ought not to he entrusted to any agency o er . an a company on the British character of which the Admiralty can rely. . . . As regards (2), the only safeguard that the Board can suggest is a marketing arrangement which would preclude the company itself, or any company to which it,' may entrust the marketing of its products, from selling any portion ol them within certain defined districts of the Middle East, which are now served by the Anglo-Eersian Oil Company, except through the agency or with the consent of that company. As regards (3), it is only necessary, for the present purpose, to consider specifically the position of Mr. D’Arcy and his assignees, or, in other words, the Anglo- Persian Oil Company. The only way of securing the interests of this company appear to the Board of Trade to be— (a.) By a sufficient participation in the capital of the new combination ; and (6.) By such a protective marketing arrangement as is contemplated under (1) and (2), combined with a provision giving the Anglo-Persian Oil Company the right to market a certain proportion of the total products ; and (c.) Some provision securing fair participation of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in any work of prospecting, mining, and manufacturing that may be entrusted by the new combination to outside agencies. The above being in bare outline the considerations to be aimed at in any scheme, it will be apparent that the precise details can only be filled in on certain assumptions, which may or may not be valid. In the following suggested scheme it has been provisionally assumed that— 1. Any arrangements arrived at must be agreeable to Germany, and both Germany and Turkey stipulate for a certain proportion of the oil fuel; 2. Both the National Bank and the Anglo-Saxon Oil Company stay in the combination ; 3. For political reasons the Foreign Office are of opinion that it is urgently necessary to come to an arrangement at once, and that they do not see their way to ake any previous enquiry as to the relations between the National Bank group and te Bagdad Railway Company, or between the Deutsche Bank and the Anglo-Saxon Oil Company; 4. His Majesty’s Government are prepared to put pressure upon the National Bank to undertake to act in accordance with vital British interests in time of strained relations. On the above assumptions, the following scheme is suggested :— A clear preponderance of the capital of the company to be British, counting for this purpose the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the National Bank as British but not the Anglo-Saxon Company ; 52 per cent, would suffice for this purpose, of which not less than 27 per cent., and preferably more, should be Anglo-Persian nominated by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the National Bank to be British subjects approved by His Majesty’s Government, and undertakings to be gi ven by them and by the groups which they represent that in any time of war or strained relations they.will obey any directions of His Majesty’s Government in matters affecting Imperial safety and defence. matters The National Bank and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to undertake that thev will not transfer their interest, or any part thereof, to any other parties without the previous approval of His Majesty’s Government, and that in anv event it ^hnll Ko * . transfer that the transferees shall come under the undertaking specified abova 1 ^ ° A marketing arrangement on the following lines to be concluded before the formation o the company, and embodied either in the concession or ?n some eouallv binding instrument; no variation m this marketino- arrano-p^P-nt tr, i ? equally the consent of His Majesty’s Government ° arrangement to be ™de ^thout class^ e produ7t^(onTd,’\iOTzi?Tkerose 1 ne e &amp; t o 1 ) ^ 50 P er T' -oh the British Government, anh to market in A^aticVurke^pSIfahndk t0 feT 17 Australia, New Zealand South Africa, and the East Coast of 1^07 exelud W th Sea.

J ' ' ' on an t , . rh ® l! ' tl , s [ l Government to have an option to purchase up to 50 per cent of the total output of fuel oil ^ The German Government to have a similar option up to 40 per cent and the Turkish Government up to 10 per cent., the requirements of the Bagdad Railway Company to be included m the German or Turkish share as mav be arranged. ’ ^ In putting forward the above scheme, the Board of Trade are not unmindful of the fact that the participation suggested for the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in the capital of the new concern is very much below that which Mr. Greenway, on behalf of the D interests, is likely to be satisfied with. On the assumptions, however on which the scheme is framed, it seems the largest proportion of the capital which there is any reasonable chance of securing in the present circumstances for the Anglo- Persian Company, and it must be remembered that the scheme confers very substantial benefits on the ^Anglo-Persian Company in other ways—by securing their existino* markets against invasion, by giving them the marketing rights with regard to 50 per cent, of the Mesopotamian products, and by securing equal treatment with the Anglo- Saxon Company in the matter of mining and prospecting in Mesopotamia. Although, therefore, Mr. Greenway and Mr. D’Arcy are not likely to be altogether satisfied with the proposed arrangement, it appears to the Board that it could be explained to them that this is the best that His Majesty’s Government is able to do for them, and that insistence on better terms would lose the concession altogether. With regard to Admiralty requirements, the Board of Trade have been in informal consultation with representatives of the Admiralty, and they believe that the scheme here put forward would have their support. It will be observed that in the proposed provisions for securing that the directors representing the British groups shall, in fact, act in accordance with British interests, no reference has been made to the proposal put forward by Sir Reginald MacLeod, that one of the representatives of the Shell group should be a British subject approved by His Majesty’s Government. It seems to the Board desirable that if in the course of negotiations this offer should still remain open it should be accepted, but that it would not be desirable, in the case of the Shell Company, to attempt to impose any condition that the British director so nominated should act under the directions of His Majesty’s Government in time of strained relations, as any such stipulation would have to be discussed with representatives of a combination on which foreign interests predominate.

HERR vox KUEHLMANN called to-day to speak to me about the Mesopotamian oil con- , cession. He said that he had heard from Herr von Gwinner, who said he feared it would be impossible for him to free himself from his contractual obligations to .the Shell Company. Personally Herr von Gwinner had no marked preference for the Shell Company, but what had happened was this :— Herr von Gwinner, in the desire of reaching an agreement with the English, had approached Sir E. Cassel (the National Bank of Turkey). Someone in the National Bank of Turkey had first brought forward the idea of an arrangement with the Shell Company, and an arrangement had subsequently been formally concluded, by which, so it appeared, the National Bank received 50 per cent, in the New Company, the Shell Company 25 per cent., and the Deutsche Bank 25 per cent. Under clause oh the articles of association it was laid down that, if one of the three parties withdrew, the shares of that party should be offered first to the other two parties: if, there fore, Herr von Gwinner had pointed out, the National Bank withdrew, the effect would be to increase the holding of the Shell Company. It was accordingly undesirable that the National Bank should go out. I said to Herr von Kuehlmann that this was based on the assumption that the New Company held a valid and undisputed title to what it olaimed. He vras already aware that His Majesty’s Government, just as much as the German Government, were anxious to avoid dealing with this question in a contentious spirit, and to reach an acceptable arrangement for the future rather than to waste time on an examination of the past. But if it became a [1056—1]question of whether or not the Shell could he ousted, assuming such a consummation, for the sake of argument, to be desirable, then there was some advantage in examining how far the title of the New Company, or the trio, was valid and undisputed. That title consisted in (d) certain rights, limited by the fact that they were expressly stated not to constitute “ a privilege or a monopoly, and by the fact that they only extended for 20 kilom. on each side of the Bagdad Railway in so far as that railway might pass through petroliferous districts,, and (b) certain claims. The rights were derived under article 22'of the Bagdad RaiHvay Convention of March 1903. The claims rested upon th'l convention concluded by the Anatolian Railway Company with the Civil List in 1904. That convention, both in the view of the legal advisers of the Sublime Porte, and in the opinion of the legal advisers of the Foreign Office, had lapsed, and it appeared, clear that no claim under it would lie . in a Court of Law. Herr von Kuehlmann admitted that the rights f the New .Company rested upon these two he understood, taken legal advice which tended to support the view that the convention of 1904 was still valid. I said that at any rate the validity was disputed r and the prospects were that, in the absence- of an agreement acceptable both to Germany and to Great Britain, there would be no satisfactory settlement and a good deal of-ill-feeling which it was most desirable to avoid. If, therefore, the presence of the Shell Company had the practical effect of blocking the concession, except in so far as any rights of the Bagdad Railway Company under the convention of 1903 were concerned, it would do itself no good by adopting a dog-in- the-manger attitude, and refusing either to be easily bought out or to accept reasonable terms. I made it clear that I was not pressing that the' Shell Company should go out,, but the point I did want to make was that the Shell Company did not really dominate the situation, for it could hardly persist in its claims under any agreement made with Herr von Gwinner, if such persistence ren dered the New Company paralytic. Such being the logic of the situation, Herr von Gwinner seemed to be in a position of vantage for exer cising suasion upon the Shell Company.I then referred to the position of the Anglo- Persian Oil Company, as tepresenting Mr. d’Arcy. I said that his Company had applied for, and been promised, the diplomatic support of His Majesty’s Government many years ago, and long before the National Bank or the Shell Company had appeared on the scene. This company, in the person of Mr. d’Arcy, had received the most definite pro mises from two Grand Viziers that the oil con cession for the vilayets of Mosul and Bagdad would be granted to them; it had been encouraged to keep an agent for many years in Constantinople, and His Majesty’s Government, while they might perhaps induce the Anglo-Persian Company to forgo its well-founded claim to the whole concession, if satisfactory terms were arranged, could not equitably, and did not desire to, abandon those who had first obtained their support. Herr von Kuehlmann asked me what arrange ment I thought would be satisfactory to His Majesty’s Government. I said that this depended to some extent upon whether or not the Shell Company was to remain in the combination, and if so what percentage it was to hold. The principal objects of His Majesty’s Government were (a) to maintain the independence of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, as they were opposed to the creation of large trusts, (b) to secure satis factory marketing arrangements, (c) to secure an abundant supply of oil at a reasonable price, and (cl) to support the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in what they considered to be a just and well- established claim to the concession. It was difficult to discuss percentages, control, and marketing arrangements without expert knowledge, but I felt confident that anything short of CO per cent, would not be regarded as adequate for the Anglo-Persian Company. If that were conceded, I thought that an arrange ment which made fair allowance for the interests of all concerned in the products ought to be- practicable ; but I thought it would be difficult to advance towards agreement until the Shell Company came to a proper sense of its own weak position in regard to Mesopotamia. I urged that Herr von G winner should be asked to put forward, through Herr von Kuehlmann, proposals which would be acceptable to him, and then a discussion eould begin to some purpose.4 I gave Herr von Ivuehlmann a copy of this memorandum for his confidential use, and lie said he would communicate further with Hen von Gwinner. He left with me the attached papeis. A. P. Foreign Office, August 20, 1913.Co ! riunicat&amp;c ccnfidantlally by Herr vcn Kubl-ianr August 20 th # Xv/iZ. A8SCHMFI * Berlin, October 19th,1912.

WITH reference to my letter of tlie 31st July, enclosing a copy of a letter from Sir R. MacLeod respecting the Mesopotamian oil concession, I am directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to request that you will be so good as to bring the following points to the urgent attention of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty. Sir E. Grey has proposed a discussion respecting this concession with Germany ; he has also informed the Turkish Ambassador that His Majesty’s Government attach very great importance to a satisfactory arrangement in regard to the Mesopotamian oil concession, and that they feel confident that the Ottoman Government will use their best endeavours to secure such a settlement. The German Covernment may at any moment wish to know what are the wishes of His Majesty’s Government in regard to the arrangements' respecting the concession, and Hakki Pasha, who is engaged upon the negotiation of various questions between His Majesty’s Government and the Turkish Government, has repeatedly asked for a clear indication of the wishes of His Majesty’s Government in regard to the oil concession. The moment, from a diplomatic view, is unusually opportune for negotiations, but Sir E. Grey is unable to enter upon negotiations either with the German Government or with Hakki Pasha, because he is unaware of the conditions which it is either desirable to obtain or possible to accept; until such information is furnished by the Departments concerned no progress can be made, and a favourable opportunity may be allowed to go by. Sir E. Grey understands, from semi-official communication with the Board of Trade, that there is some possibility of the proposals contained in Sir R. MacLeod’s letter of the 30th July being acceptable, as the basis of a settlement satisfactory to His Majesty’s Government, though he has no definite information on the subject. He considers that there may be some advantage in allotting a certain share to Sir R. MacLeod’s Company, which derives some claim to participation owing to the rights of the Bagdad Railway Company ; he also assumes that, on conditions, the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty would be willing to admit that company to participation, as to exclude a company which commands such large supplies might possibly have regrettable effects from a naval point of view, though this is a matter upon which he desires an expression of opinion from the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty. Sir E. Grey considers it important to bear in mind that the German Government may, and probably will, claim a certain percentage of oil fuel, and, in case they do, he would be glad to know, before negotiations begin, what arrangements the Lords Commissioners would agree to. Hakki Pasha has intimated that the Turkish Government would insist upon the retention of a certain, though small, percentage of oil fuel and other products, for railways, river navigation, and naval purposes. I 'am to state that Sir E. Grey would he glad if the Lords Commissioners, after communication with the Board of Trade, would furnish him, if possible, by the middle of next week, with a clear and comprehensive statement as to the points indicated in the fourth paragraph of this letter. A similar letter has been written to the Board of Trade. I am, &amp;c. W. LANGLEY.

Hopwood. My Dear Hopwood, Foreign Office, August 1, 1913. THANK you for your letter of to-day. I agree that a hurried settlement is not likely to he a good one ; hut what we do want is a clear indication from the Admiralty of what they will agree to in different contiugencies : ( 1 ) if the Deutsche Bank can throw over the Anglo-Saxon (2), if they cannot. This would enable us to enter upon negotiation with Germany or Turkey with more prospect of success than if we are uncertain as to what is either wanted or acceptable. Indeed, the Deutsche Bank may he unwilling to inform us if they are free to break their contract with the Anglo-Saxon group until we say what conditions we would agree to if they did throw over that group. We have been negotiating about this concession now for over a year, and from the diplomatic point of view delay is undesirable, and not likely to lead to improved terms for us : it is really important to take advantage of Hakki Pasha s presence in London, and there is always the possibility of a change of Government in Turkey which might harm oar prospects. We are being constantly urged by the Turkish Government to come to some agreement. As to the National Bank of Turkey, we are really indifferent at the Foreign Office whether they stay in the combine or come out; but if they come out, then presumably 52 per cent, for the Anglo-Persian group would be claimed, and it is doubtful if the Anglo-Saxon group would agree to accept say 25 per cent, with the Anglo-Persian holding 52 per cent., and the Deutsche Bank 23 per cent. There may, therefore, be advantage in keeping in the National Bank, if in so doing we can tie them down to conditions as to control which would safeguard British interests. Our first object is, I suppose, to protect British Government interests as distinct from those of the Anglo-Persian Company; if, in every respect, the interests of the British Government do not go so far as the interests of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, then the Anglo-Persian Oil Company must be urged to moderate its claims. The Turkish Government, so we understand from Hakki Pasha, would prefer, and may insist upon, the admission of the Anglo-Saxon group to a share. The information I ask for in the first paragraph of this letter is for the confidential use and guidance of the Foreign Office. We have waited so long &lt;£ for the groups concerned to find common ground ” that we are not sanguine that they will do so now if left to themselves. If MacLeod’s schemes are illusory and one-sided, will not the Admiralty say, with the necessary details, what scheme would not be so ? Yours sincerely, LOUIS MALLET. r o O M $3 [August 1.] 19.5 j Section 2.

HERR YON KUEHLMANN came to see me to-day in order to o-iv e a few explanations respecting the German counter-draft for a settlement of the Bao-dad Railway and cognate questions. As the counter-draft is to be sent officially to-morrow I will defer reporting his remarks on those points until it is received. He said that the German Ambassador had received our memorandum about the Mesopotamian oil concession, and had referred the matter to Berlin for instructions He asked me if I could give him any indication of the views of His Majesty’s Government. I replied that I was not in a position to do this, but that what was of great importance was that the Deutsche Bank should not commit themselves any further to the Anglo-Saxon and National Bank group until further communication had taken place between the British and German Governments. He said he would at once report in this sense to Berlin, asking that a hint might be given to Herr von Gwinner in confidence. He then said that last year the German Government, wishing to remove a possible source of friction between the British and German Governments, had suggested to Herr von Gwinner that he should come to terms with the English ; that Herr von Gwinner, wishing to deal with a representative Englishman, had approached Sir E Cassel, whose bank at Constantinople was then looked upon as being in close touch with His Majesty’s Government; and that now, to his great annoyance^ Herr von Gwinner found himself in the wrong boat. It was Sir E. Cassel, so far as Herr von Kuehlmann * was aware, and not the Deutsche Bank, who had entered into negotiation with the Anglo-Saxon Company. The German Government, he thought, did not wish to establish or favour monopolies in oil where it was possible to avoid them, and he thought, though he was of course only expressing his own personal view, that provided adequate arrangements were made for supplying the German Government with a fair share of oil-fuel, and for the sale on favourable terms of other oil products to Germans, that the German Government would have no objection to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company being the technical company in connection with the Mesopotamian oil concession, though he could not be certain how far Herr von Gwinner was actually bound to the Anglo-Saxon Company. He then asked me why Sir E. Cassel had. entered into an agreement with a company which did not enjoy the support of His Majesty’s Government, and I replied that he had better ask Sir E. Cassel; that His Majesty’s Government had consistently supported the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s application for the concession for years. He said that if the National Bank went out then perhaps the Anglo-Persian Company could have 50 per cent, of the whole : I said that I could not say anything definite on this point, but I asked him if the Germans had any particular affection for the Anglo-Saxon Company, to which he replied in the negative. He said Herr von Gwinner was most anxious to be accommodating in the matter. s A copy of this has been sent to the Admiralty and to the Board of Trade. [A] ASIATIC TURKEY AND ARABIA.

With reference to the second paragraph of this despatch I am pleased to learn that it now appears that a new contract was not concluded between the German company and the Ministry of Finance, but that at the interview on the 14th April Mahmud Shevket Pasha was merely referring to the transfer of the rights of the Civil List to the Ministry of Finance, whereby a concession granted by the former would have to be recognised by the latter Department. The question of the proposed amalgamation of rival interests is referred to in my letter to you of the 29tlwultimo, and I have no further observations to offer thereon. The admission of the Grand Vizier as to the non-existence of any new contract confirms the view we have always held, and have represented to you, as to the extreme intangibility of the German claim, and we trust that his Excellency will be able to take advantage of this in pressing the Turkish Government to an early recognition of our rights.

Winchester House, Old Broad Street, London, Sir, April 29, 1913. I BEG to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 28th instant transmitting copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople reporting on a further interview which he lias had with the Turkish Grand Vizier on the subject of the Mesopotamian oil concession. With reference to the hint which was let drop by Mahmud Shevket Pasha to the effect that if an amalgamation of interests can be effected between our group and the newly-formed Turkish Petroleum Company it might be practicable to secure a controlling share of the enterprise for British interests, I am desired to state that if this result can be attained my Board would not be opposed to such an amalgamation. This control can, however, in our opinion, only be secured and maintained by a stipulation to the effect that a preponderating share—say not less than 60 per pent.— in the enterprise shall he held by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (Limited), (i.e., the group associated with Mr. D’Arcy), and that the technical and commercial working of the company to be ultimately formed to work the concession shall be entirely in their hands, the newly-formed Turkish Petroleum Company only being interested in the enterprise as shareholders. The Turkish Petroleum Company as at present constituted is, we understand, composed of the Deutsche Bank, the Shell Company, and the National Bank of turkey, their interests holding respectively 25 per cent., 25 per cent., and 50 per cent, of the shares in the company. At the interview which, at Sir Edward Grey’s suggestion, I had with Sir Babington Smith some months ago he stated definitely : 1 . That it would not be practicable to give our group a preponderating interest in their company, and that the most they could consider would be 25 per cent. 2 . That if, as would doubtless be the case, the Shell Company asked for technical and commercial control, the National Bank of lurkey and the Deutsche Bank would have no alternative but to support their claim. In other words, the newly-formed Turkish Petroleum Company being dominated by foreign interests can only be regarded ms a separate foreign entity, and British contiol can only be secured by stipulating that a preponderating share shall be held by a separate and purely British group. _ . . Should such an arrangement be practicable we should be quite agreeable to falling in with an amalgamation scheme of this nature, but from what Sir Bahington Smith • -» i n • 1 * I’lTI 'L i 1 r-v 4- /'•wl T-r r\ r-i L L Vi O O L L iP 1 1 rl /'V'f P.ll A M A1 I Company in this matter, I think it extremely unlikely that the Turkish Petroleum Companv will agree to any arrangement whereby they cannot ensure to themselves a controlling interest.

Such a guarantee would enable D’Arcy to advance a large sum and on better terms than his competitors. In view of hint in Sir H.

CfWYDYR HOUSE, WHITEHALL, I o.is directed by the board of Trade to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st June, with respect to the negotiations for an arrangement between the National Bank group and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company with regard to the oil fields of Mesopotamia. Jith regard to the suggested compromise put forward in your letter, the Board of Trade direct me, before ; i making any communication to Mr. Greenway, to draw your attention to the following considerations:- The Board understand the effect of your suggestion to be that the capital and control of the new Company should to the extent of 52 per cent be British, but that the British share should be made up of two parts, represented by the Anglo-Peraian Oil Company (about 34 per cent) and the National Bank (about 17 per cent). It is evident that such an arrangement The Under Becretary of State, Foreign Office.arrangement would not secure the interests of the Anglo- Persian Oil Company unless there v/ere some guarantee that the National bank group would act together with them as against the foreign controlled groups in matters of importance to Lritish interests. Failing such a guarantee it is clear that any arrangement now made for marketing, unless made unalterable by being actually embodied in the Concession or in some other way could be revised or set aside in future, and the Admiralty might then find them selves deprived of the protection of their supplies, to which the Board understand they attach great importance. \ It appears, therefore, to the Board that an essential condition of any such arrangement as that outlined in your letter would have to Be either that the marketing agreement should be made in advance in a form incapable of inodifica'* tion without the assent oi His Majesty's Government, or alternatively that the national Bank should give b. sind^ng assurance that they would co-operate with tne Anglo i ersian Oil Company upon the directorate oi the new Company» Perhaps the most satisfactory method of giving effect to the latter alternative would be that both the National BankLank and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company should pledge themselves that in natters involving British interests their representatives on the directorate should seek and follow the directions of His Majesty’s Government. At the same time His Majesty’s Government might intimate that the marketing arrangements to be made by the new Company are in their judgment matters affecting British interests. if such an assurance were given perhaps the following distribution of capital might be acceptable:- Anglo-Persian Oil Company...... ob National Bank 2b Deutsche Bank 2b Anglo-baxon Company lb 100 I have, &amp;c., (Signed) H.

Anglo-Persian Oil Company to Foreign Office.—(Received June 23.') (Confidential.) Winchester House, Old Broad Street, London, June 23, 1913. WITH reference to my interview on Tuesday with Sir Edward Grey on the subject of the Mesopotamian oil concession, I am desired by my board to put forward the following further points for consideration :— At various times during the course of the negotiations for a contract with the Admiralty for oil-fuel we have represented that two steps were necessary for ensuring the maintenance of the Persian oil-fields as a source of supply for oil-fuel for His Majesty’s navy, viz.:— 1. A contract for the purchase of all the oil-fuel we can produce, in excess of the quantity required for the local Indian markets, up to a quantity of, say, 500,000 tons per annum, coupled with a sufficient guarantee, or “ advance payment,” to enable us to raise the additional capital (not less than 2 , 000 , 000 Z.) which would be required to produce this quantity of oil-fuel. 2. The support of His Majesty’s Government to Mr. D’Arcy’s claim to the concession for oil in the provinces of Mosul and Bagdad, which, if it came under the control of the group who are now seeking to obtain it in competition with us, would become a very serious menace to this company. I explained to Sir Edward Grey that the undoubted object of the rival group in desiring to secure control of the Mesopotamian concession was to use the oil produced therefrom as a means of attack on the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the Burma Oil Company, with a view to forcing one or both of these companies into an arrangement whereby they would secure the control of their outputs. I further explained that the power of the group in this direction is at present somewhat limited by the considerable disadvantage in freight at which they would stand in a war of rates, and that it was doubtless with a view to endeavouring to overcome this disadvantage, and thereby placing themselves in a more favourable position for forcing us into their foreign-controlled combine, that they have already secured oil concessions in Egypt, and are now seeking to secure the concession for Mesopotamia. So far the exploitation of their Egyptian field has not given promise of any large production of oil, but were they to secure the Mesopotamian concession and be successful in obtaining from this field a considerable supply of oil there is but little doubt that it would be used as a weapon of attack in the manner indicated above. In this connection I am desired to point out that failure on our part to conclude at an early date the proposed contract and to secure the Mesopotamian concession, or at least its control, may render it impossible for us to maintain our independence, and that among the probable consequences of this there are several that would more particularly affect India, viz.:— 1. Should the Indian Government later on find it desirable to substitute oil-fuel for coal, they are not then likely to be able to purchase it at the low rate at which we are now offering it under a combined contract. 2. The Indian consumer would eventually have to pay a much higher price for his kerosene. 3. The development of the Baluchistan oil-fields and the control of its production by a purely British company may not be practicable. These points are ones which my board think deserve the most serious consideration of the Indian Government in connection with the proposal that they should co-operate with the Admiralty in the coutract for the purchase of 1 eisian oil-fuel. [2950 z —1] i-t i 1The second especially is one that calls for serious attention in the interests of Indian consumers, as the price of kerosene in India is now being maintained at a much lower price than that ruling in other parts of the world, solely by reason of the undertaking which was given many years ago by the Burma Oil Company, and which has always been strictly carried out by them, not to sell their standard quality of kerosene at over rupees 3 : 8 per unit of 2 tins ex-warehouse at Budge Budge (Calcutta). In the present condition of the world’s markets it would be easily practicable to raise the price by fully 1 rupee to rupee 1 : 8 , which would mean that Indian consumers would be called upon to pay some 2 to 3 crores, or, say, 1,300,000b to 2,000,000b, more per annum for their oil than they are paying at present, and were the combine to gain control of the Burma supplies it, is beyond doubt that this additional tribute—the great bulk of which tvould come out of the pockets of the ryots—would be exacted by them from Indian consumers. As my board feel that the above points cannot but have a considerable bearing upon the question now under consideration, they venture to suggest that a copy of this letter should be forwarded to the India Office, together with an expression of the views of His Majesty’s Government on the subject.

Section 2. 128398] No. 1. Board of Trade to Foreign Office.—(Received June 21.) (Secret.) Sir, Board of Trade, June 20, 1913. WITH reference to your letter of the 22nd May and other correspondence relative to the Mesopotamian oil concession, I am directed by the Board of Trade to state, for Sir E. Grey’s information, that, in consequence of informal inter-departmental communications, a conference was held at this office on Thursday, the 5th June, when in addition to representatives ol this Department, the Foreign Office, and the Admiralty, Sir H. Babington Smith and Mr. C. Green way were present on behalf of their respective groups. At that conference emphasis was laid by the departmental representatives on the advisability of a combination of the two competing groups, and the probability that should such a combination not be realised the oil concession in question either would not be granted by the Turkish Government or would fall into the hands of a third party. Sir H. Babington Smith and Mr. Greenway both recognised the force of these considerations, but a lengthy discussion failed to arrive at any basis for a combination which would be acceptable to both parties. Mr. Green way stated that his group attached most importance to securing for the Anglo-Persian Oil Company the marketing of the oil and other products; otherwise they feared that the marketing would be done by the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company,, which is a member of the syndicate represented by Sir H. Babington Smith, and is already in competition with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and endeavouring to force it into the international combination of which the Anglo-Saxon Company forms part. If the Anglo-Persian Company could, by a preliminary agreement, be assured of the marketing, Mr. Greenway’s group would be prepared to take only 33J per cent, in the proposed joint company ; otherwise they must insist on such a holding as would give them control. Sir H. Babington Smith’s proposal was to the effect that his group should have a 75 per cent, share in the company to be formed, thus leaving only 25 per cent, to the group represented by Mr. Greenway, and that no arrangement whatever should be made as to the marketing of the output until the producing stage should be actually reached. He was not prepared to undertake, on behalf of the National Bank of Turkey, to support any claim by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to the marketing, but held that the proposed company must be left entirely free to take whatever course it deemed likely to serve its interests best. After various suggestions had been made as to possible ways of adjusting the claims of the two parties, it was decided that the conference could not carry the matter further for the time being, but Sir H. Babington Smith and Mr. Greenway undertook to discuss the matter between themselves in the light of the considerations urged and suggestions put forward at the conference. The Board of Trade were subsequently informed that Sir H. Babington Smith and Mr. Greenway had not found it possible to arrive at any agreement. It appeared to the Board that, having regard to the reasonable claims and interests of both parties, an equitable arrangement might be reached on the basis of 1. The apportionment of capital in a new company equally between the two groups claiming the concession ; and . 2. The apportionment of the output between the two groups, lor marketing purposes, in approximately equal proportions with some allocation ol markets. This suggestion was conveyed to Mr. Greenway, who, in a letter dated the 12th June, accepted it in principle on behalf of his group, and made some detailed proposals as to The Board then caused the suggested basis of an arrangement to be communicated [2950 x—2] Bto Sir H. Babington Smith, with an intimation of their belief that it would be acceptable to Mr. Greenway. They are now in receipt of a letter from Sir H Babington Smith stating that it is impossible for his group to accept an arrano-ement on the lines indicated.

To accept a participation on any other basis would, I pointed out, mean that we should be merely investing money in a business in which we should have no control a proposition which would ofier no inducement whatever to us, and which would be quite opposed to the objects which we, as active producers of oil ourselves and representino* purely British interests, have in view. Sir Babington said that he quite appreciated our point of view, but that he regretted that his discussion with his associates offered no prospect whatever of any more favourable arrangement, and consequently it was agreed that no object would be served by further continuing our^ endeavours to find a basis for amalgamation which would be acceptable to both parties. The proposal now made by Sir Babington Smith on behalf of his group is practically the same as, and certainly no better than, the one indicated by him to Sir Edward Grey several months ago, and the objections to it to-day are even stronger than they were then, because it has since been made abundantly clear— 1 . That the members of this group are inalienably bound together ; 2 . That the dominating influence in it is foreign; and 3. That the object of the dominant member is one of* attack on the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. In the circumstances I am desired by Mr. D’Arcy to express the hope that His Majesty’s Government will continue to give their strongest support to his endeavours to induce the Turkish Government to fulfil their engagement to him, and indicate to them in the most emphatic manner possible that the granting of the concession to the German group, in breach of the undertaking given to him, would be regarded by His Majesty’s Government with the gravest disfavour. From a remark made by Sir Babington Smith, it would appear that he has had a recent interview with Hakki Pasha on the subject, and I would venture to suggest that it might be desirable to inform Hakki Pasha and also the Grand Vizier that in this matter the National Bank of Turkey’s interests cannot, in view of the constitution of the group with which they are associated, be regarded as British. This is the more advisable inasmuch as it is probable that the Grand Vizier, when recently recommending an amalgamation of the rival interests, and suggesting the possibilhy of an arrangement whereby a controlling share might be secured by British interests, had in view some such arrangement as is now proposed by Sir Babington Smith, and that he is unaware of the fact that the National Bank’s interest would, in effect, be purely foreign.

WITH reference to my interview with you this morning, at which you informed me that Sir Babington Smith’s group were now willing to concede to our group a 50 per cent, participation in the proposed joint syndicate or company, I have since discussed the matter with such of my colleagues as are at the moment available, and we are of opinion that, if His Majesty’s Government consider it quite impossible to effect an arrangement whereby a preponderance of British interests can be absolutely assured, my group may be agreeable to an arrangement on the following lines :— 1 . A syndicate or company to be formed in which the Deutsche Bank-National Bank-Anglo-Saxon group and our group should each have 50 per cent, of partici pation. 2 . Each group to have equal representation on the board of such syndicate or company. 3 . The British Government to have the right to nominate a representative on the board, who shall act as chairman and have a casting vote. [2950 a?—2} B 24 4 . The syndicate or company to be worked as an entirely independent concern, but all arrangements for the marketing of its products to be entrusted to the two groups on the following basis :— (a.) Oil fuel for all parts of the world by the D’Arcy g r o u P- (b.) Benzine for all parts of the world by the National Bank group. (c.) Kerosene, lubricating, and other heavy oils, wax, candles, &amp;c., by— ( 1 .)

(Limited), of Bagdad, Basra, and Mohammerah, who are already organised for the purpose. The above proposals are of course, only tentative, as I have not yet had an opportunity of discussing them with all of my colleagues, but I think it probable that they would be agreed to if His Majesty’s Government cannot see their way to any better arrangement. , . , „ „ Yours faithfully, C. G BEEN WAY. Enclosure 4 in No. 1. Mr. Stanley to Mr. Greenway. (Confidential.) Dear Mr. Green way, Board of Trade, June 13, 1913. I AM much obliged to you for your letter of yesterday. There is just one observation I should like to make upon it in order to prevent any misapprehension. I did not at our interview say that Sir H. Babington Smith’s group vvere willing to concede your group a 50 per cent, participation in the proposed joint syndicate. I thought I made it clear that the Department, being desirous of reconciling the conflicting interests of the rival claimants, were disposed to suggest a settlement on this basis; that the suggestion was offered on our responsibility, and that Babington Smith had not yet been approached on the subject. Your acceptance of the suggestion will enable us to take a step further. I note the proposals you make with regard to marketing products. May I enquire whether, if the question of participation can be satisfactorily arranged, your group would agree to an equal distribution of the products with a territorial preference as regards marketing, in the event of it being impossible to obtain agreement to your proposals ? Yours very truly, GEO. J. STANLEY. Enclosure 5 in No. 1. Mr. Greenway to Mr. Stanley. Winchester House, Old Broad Street, London, Dear Mr. Stanley, June 13, 1913. I AM in receipt of your letter of date, and note that I was mistaken in under standing you to say that Sir H. Babington Smith’s group were willing to concede our group a 50 per cent, participation in the proposed joint syndicate, and that the suggestion was one that your Department proposed putting forward on their own responsibilit}n The suggestion that we might agree to an equal distribution of products with a territorial preference as regards marketing is one that I am afraid we cannot agree to, as in practice it would involve complications which would be difficult, if not impossible, to overcome. The proposals which I have put forward would, so far as kerosene, heavy oils, &amp;c., are concerned, in efiect be the same as equal distribution with territorial preference, and so far as regards benzine and liquid fuel, one is a reasonable set-offagainst the other. Moreover, nay proposals are better calculated to maintain the independence of our group, and consequently a continuance of competition. Yours sincerely, k C. GREENWAY. Enclosure 6 in No. 1. Sir H. Llewellyn Smith to Sir H. Babington Smith. My dear Babington Smith, Board of Trade, Jane 18, 1918. SINCE the receipt of your letter of the 10 th June we have continued to give the question of the Mesopotamian oil concession very careful consideration, and have had some communication with Mr. Greenway about it. I have now reason to believe that we could persuade Mr. Greenway to accept an arrangement on the lines of— 1 . The apportionment of capital in the concession company equally between the two groups ; and 2 . The apportionment of the output between the two groups for marketing purposes either by the allocation to each group of particular products, or by a geographical division of markets, or by a combination of these methods. I should be glad to learn as soon as possible whether you think your group would be willing to consider such an arrangement in principle, in which event I will endeavour at once, after discussion with Mr. Greenway, to put before you a concrete and detailed proposal for consideration, I know the objection taken by your group to any arrangement as to marketing at the present stage, but 1 venture to hope that, in the circumstances, they will not persist in that objection, as I see no other way of removing the present deadlock. I need hardly repeat what you probably know already—that unless the two groups can agree to some mutual arrangement the concession is practically certain not to be granted at all, or will fall into the hands of a third party, a result which we should all deplore. Yours sincerely, H. LLEWELLYN SMITH. Enclosure 7 in No. 1. Sir H. Babington Smith to Sir H. Llewellyn Smith. My dear Llewellyn Smith, 50, Cornhill, London, June 19, 1913. I HAVE received your letter of the 18th June on the Mesopotamia oil question. I fear that it would be impossible for us to accept an arrangement on the lines which you mention. The Deutsche Bank, having stipulated for one-fourth share in the whole enterprise in return for rights and claims which they possessed, will not consent to any reduction of their portion. The result then would be that only one- fourth of the whole concern would remain for the National Bank of Turkey and the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company. The second condition is, I fear, equally unacceptable for the reasons which I have already explained to you. If this is Mr. Greenway’s last word, we can only come to the conclusion that no arrangement is possible. In any case, as there is a third party in the field, we consider ourselves free to do anything that seems likely to protect oui interests m the matter. Yours sincerely, XL BABINGTON SMITH.

I AM commanded by my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to acquaint you with reference to India Office letter of the 24th May that they note with much satis faction that all the present indications and calculations are favourable to the use of oil fuel on certain of the Indian Government railways. 2. My Lords are proceeding with the question of the possibility of entering into a contract with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company for supplies of oil for the naval service over a long term of years. The option of an increase of quantity within two years of the signing of the contract which the company have offered would, no doubt, enable due provision to be made by the company lor supplies to India of 200,000 tons a-year, in the event of the Admiralty not desiring, as seems probable, to draw so much in normal circumstances from that one source of supply as the maximum of 500,000 tons proposed by the company. 3. The contingency has to be faced, however, that some difficulty may anse to prevent the Admiralty from concluding the contract in view of the novel pioposal, which needs much consideration, that an advance shall be made year by year thereundei of a certain portion of the cost of the oil, and that the Admiralty shall take the risk of oil being forthcoming in sufficient quantities to repay the amount advanced. My Lords understand that if the Admiralty are ultimately unable to ^ make^ a contract on those terms the company will have no option but to submit to absorption into a arge com bination, who would provide the necessary capital for development but who would not be prepared to offer the favourable prices now available. This would obviously lead to a corresponding material increase in the price tendered by the company for deliveries to Karachi for the Indian railways, and in that case the basis on which the present favourable calculations are made would be upset. 4 . My Lords desire accordingly to suggest to the Secretary of State for India i Council whether this contingency should not be at once represented confidentially by cable to the Indian Government with a view to considering whether, m those circum stances, an immediate decision might not be arrived at on the basis of the wide experience already available as to oil-driven locomotives in many countries and the ex ]S tmg data as to relative cost of oil and coal, and consequently, on that decision, not be taken to secure supplies at the prices now offered by means of an Indian Gove ment guarantee of interest for a term of years on the new capital which the co p y managing director of the company, has stated that a guarantee of 4 per cent interest by the Indian Government for a period of ten years on 2,000,000/. of capital would meet the case. [2950 £—3] f ^ G r- 26 J UNI 1 Q 1 ' 3 a6 . The outside liability would thus be, at the worst, about 800,000/., as compared with a possible risk of 2,000,000/. if the Admiralty proceed purely on the lines of contract advances over twenty years. It would appear, therefore, that it is greatly to the mutual advantage of Imperial and Indian interests to proceed on the basis suggested^ with a 'pro rdta share in the risk involved. As a matter of principle, the Admiralty could not expect India to take a risk in this matter for naval interests, and conversely the Admiralty could not embark upon heavy liabilities, and give India the full benefit of cheap oil and other possible collateral advantages. These advantages would include the freer competition of suppliers of oil products in Indian markets, as well as the preservation of the independence of a British company working in Persia, to which it is understood that the Indian Government attaches importance, also in relation to possible oil developments in Baluchistan. 7 . If the guarantee were given by the Indian Government it would be a matter for consideration and arrangement by what detailed method the cost should be divided’ proportionately to the interests at stake, between Indian and Imperial funds in respect of any such payments of interest as might be made, and ultimately fail to be recoverable, in a reasonable agreed time by deduction from sums due by the Admiralty or India in respect of oil actually delivered under their respective contracts. 8 . My Lords will be glad if Lord Crewe can see his way to cause this urgent and important matter to be considered in the light of these remarks, and a decision commu nicated at as early a date as possible, as it may not be practicable to hold open the negotiations.

Lowther to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received June 16.) (No. 521.) Sir, Constantinople, June 12 , 1913. 1 OBSERVE the copy of the contract between Dr. Zander and the Civil list for the eventual exploitation of the petroleum fields of Bagdad and Mosul, as communicated to Mr. Maxwell by Sir H. Babington Smith in his letter of the 23rd April last, presents a considerable number of variations from the version forwarded to your Department by Sir W. Townley in his despatch No. 837 of the 28th October, 1904. Sir H. Babington Smith’s copy is, however, no doubt authentic, and I therefore think it worth while to call your attention to one variation in the text, which seems to me to make the case for the German claim even weaker than we have hitherto supposed. The variation in question occurs in article 1, where the “ etudes preliminaires ” which the railway company undertook to carry out are defined in the authentic document as “ sondages et autres,” a specification which did not appear in the version previously in our possession. Now it is well known that the “ etudes preliminaires ” actually made by the company were of the most superficial character, and it is, moreover, obvious from the sum which they claim to have expended, which according to the late Grand Vizier was no more than £ T. 17,000 in round figures, that nothing in the nature of boring on a scale adequate to allow of an opinion being formed of the potentialities of the two vilayets can have been attempted. The cost of carriage of the necessary machinery alone would have absorbed most of this amount. Thus an essential preliminary condition of the contract was unfulfilled, and I suggest that the failure of the company to carry out this obligation invalidates the whole contract including the right of preference provided by article 6 . It would appear that it is less a question, as suggested in the memorandum attached to Sir H. Babington Smith’s letter, whether the rights of the company have lapsed, than whether the rights to be acquired under the contract were ever established. If this view is correct—and it would seem to be the view held by the Turkish Government in 1909, and by the Department of Mines at the present time—the “ protet ” lodged by the company in 1909 would seem to have no force. It would, however, be interesting to learn from Sir H. Babington Smith the exact circumstances which gave rise to this protest. I have, &amp;c. GERALD LOWTHER.

I AM in receipt of your letter of date, and note that I was mistaken in under standing you to say that Sir H.

The suggestion that we might agree to an equal distribution of products with a territorial preference as regards marketing is one that I am afraid we cannot agree to, as in practice it would involve complications which would be difficult, if not impossible, to overcome. The proposals which I have put forward would, so far as kerosene, heavy oils, &amp;c., are concerned, in effect be the same as equal distribution with territorial preference, and so far as regards benzine and liquid fuel, one is a reasonable set off against the other. Moreover, my proposals are better calculated to maintain the independence of our group, and consequently a continuance of competition. Yours sincerely, C. GREEN WAY.

Mr. Greenway to Sir L. Mallet.—(Received June 4.) Winchester House, Old Broad Street, Dear Sir Louis Mallet, London, June 3, 1913. I HAVE received a disquieting telegram from Mr. Stock at Constantinople. The message is slightly mutilated, but the following is doubtless the correct translation :— “ The following information is from the clerk at the Ministry of Mines :— “ Grand Vizier [has] informed the Minister of Mines he wishes to give the concession for the Bagdad and Moussoul petroleum [to] German group. Minister of Mines strongly opposed such action, adhering to [his] scheme adjudication. Suggest that inform Foreign Office in view of possibility strong but discreet representation [be made] to delegate in London [Hakki Pasha]. Fear Grand Vizier may have purposely compromised Turkish Government please his German friends. Informing the Ambassador present position.” The position appears to be a serious one, and although the Ambassador will, of course, take immediate steps in the matter, I think that Mr. Stock’s suggestion that representations on the subject be made to Hakki Pasha is a good one, if practicable. If Hakki Pasha can be persuaded to cable—-for the matter is one, apparently, of some urgency—to his Government the views of the Foreign Office in regard to the attitude of the Grand Vizier, the latter will doubtless hesitate before definitely committing himself to the Germans. I should like, if possible, to discuss the question with you prior to the conference that has been fixed for noon on Thursday, and unless I hear from you to the contrary I would propose to call at 11'30 a.m. on that morning. I enclose for your information copy of a memorandum of an interview between the Minister of Mines and Mr. Stock on the 29th ultimo. Yours, &amp;c. C. GREENWAY. Enclosure in No. 1. Memorandum of Interview with the Minister of Mines. AFTER several attempts to see him I was received to-day, and enquired if he had received a reply from the Sublime Porte, or generally any other communication. He said he had not, at which I expressed surprise that the business should be allowed to drag on. He replied that his colleagues were exceedingly busy at the present time, and could not give their attention to matters of this kind. I suggested that as the matter was of great importance to his department he might find means to induce the Ministers to give the matter a little of their time, and so enable us to get on with the business. He made no reply to this, but stated that we must not think we had any prior right in the matter. I replied that we had an undeniable right, and though our points of view were divergent on this particular subject at present, when the time came we would prove our position. He repeated that neither the Germans nor ourselves have any rights whatever, and evidently meant this to be a formal statement. He went on to say that the vilayets would be put up to auction. I protested that it could not be done. He then said theie was nothing to prevent him getting an offer for the concessions from us, and then ascertaining if the Germans would improve thereon. If they did he would comn back to us with a view to our improving on the German offer, and so on. I told him we could not admit this course either. [2950 d —6] Oy/ dui&lt; 15 i oThe Minister, as usual, showed aversion to discuss the subject; he always appears uncomfortable wdien talking about the business, and confines himself entirely to the “ auction ” idea. I concluded by saying that in the absence of the Porte’s instructions no useful end could be served by our discussing a course to which w 7 e could not possibly agree, ^ and asked when he hoped to have a reply. He said he could not say, but would let me know as soon as he received one. I hear from the chief clerk that the Minister has received quite a number of visits from Baron de Ward and Mr. Edwards. Further, that the Minister has received communications on the concessions, wThch, however, he does not send down to the proper department, and this fact has given rise to a complaint by the chief mining engineer of the Ministry. The chief clerk tells me to beware of a coup by the Minister, but as this person is entirely under the control of Mahmoud Shevket Pasha I do not think there is anything to fear in the way of a surprise. 1 May 28, 1913. ii M ■CONFIDENTIAL. t Sir G.

From enquiries it would appear that, as National Bank, unlike the Ottoman Bank and other banking establishments here, has not so far taken a keen interest in purely commercial business, its withdrawal would not be greatly felt by traders with England or general public, while recent appointment of an Englishman as Director of Ottoman Bank here gives that institution a more directly British colouring than before. As regards our endeavouring to induce some other British banking firms to take j their place, such a course would appear to entail a responsibility on His Majesty’s ! Government, and, in view of prevailing state of unrest in Turkey, would, I am advised, be inadvisable at present juncture. If, later on, some British firm takes initiative, case would be different. As regards British enterprise in Mesopotamia, which is more proper British sphere, services of Eastern Bank, an English institution already established at Bagdad, would presumably be available. v [ 790 - 398 ][This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] 4 s' [A] ASIATIC TURKEY AND ARABIA.

WINCHESTE'B HOUSE, OLO HOAD STREET, LONDON, N.G. tlalit# , i9x»3 • Sir: With reference to my Interview on Tuesday with Sir Edward Grey on the subject of the Mesopotamian Oil Concession I em desired by toy Board to put forward the following further points for consideration. At various times during the course of the negotia 1 tions for a contract with the Admiralty for Oil Fuel we have represented that two steps were necessary for ensuring the maintenance of the Persian oilfields as a source of supply for Oil Fuel for His Majesty’s Navy, viz:- (1) A contract for the purchase of all the Oil Fuel we can produce, ia excess of the quantity required for the local and Indian markets, up to a quantity of say 500,000 tons per annum, coupled with a sufficient guarantee, or 'advance payment', to enable us to raise the additional Capital (not less than £2,000,000) which would be required to produce this quantity of Oil Fuel. (2) Tiie support of His Majesty’s Government to Mr.D’Arcy’s claim to the Concession for Oil in the fhe Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office.the provinces of Mosoul tine. Ba^ndad, v/hich, if it came under the control of the group v'ho are now seeking to obtain it in competition with us, vould become a very serious ienace to this Company. I explained to Sir Edward Grey that the imdoubted object of the rival cf the Ilesopotajilan duced therefrora as Persian Oil Company viow to forcing ore group in debiring to secure control Concession vas to use the Oil pro- a means of attack on the Anglo- , and The Burmah Oil Company, with a or both of these Companies into on arnrn.: ament v/ber ehy they would secure the control of tholr outputs. I further explained that the power of the group in this direction is at present somewhat limited by the considerable disadvantage in fxmignn at r.nich th.ey would stand in a war of rates, and uhuu it was doubt- loss with a view to endeavouring to overcome this dis advantage , and thereby placing themselves in a more favourable position for forcing us into their foreign controlled Combine, they they have already secured Oil Concessions in Egypt, and are now socking to secure the Concession for Mesopotamia. Bo far the exploitation of their Egyptian field hashas not given promise oi any large production of oil, hut were they to secure the Mesopotamian Concession, and he successful in obtaining from this field a considerable supply of Oil, there is but little doubt that it would be used as a weapon of attack in the manner indicated above. In this connection I am desired to point out that failure on our part to conclude at an early date the proposed contract, and to secure the Mesopotamian Con cession or at least its control, may render it Impossible for us to maintain our independence, and that among the probable consequences of this there are several that would more particularly affect India, viz:- (l) Should the Indian Government later on find it desirable to substitute Oil Fuel for Coal they are not then likely to be able to purchase it at the low rate at which we are now offering it under a combined contract; (^) The Indian consumer would eventually have to pay a much higherprice for his Kerosene; (3) The development of the Baluchistan Oil fields, and the control of its production, by a purely British Company may not be practicable. These points are ones which my Board think deserve the most serious consideration of the Indian Governmentin connection with the propone! that they should co operate with the Admiralty in the contract tor the pur chase of Persian Oil Fuel. The second, especially. Is one that calls for serious attention in the Interests of Indian conscunars, as the price of Kerosene in India is now being main tained at a much lower price than that ruling in other parts of the TorId solely by reason of the undertaking 'Tilch was given many years ago by The Burmah Oil Company, and which has always been strictly carried out by them, not to sell their standard quality of Kerosene at over Rs.S/ b/O., per unit of 2 tins ex-warehouse at Budge Budge (Calcutta). In the present condition of the World’s markets it would be easily practicable to raise the price by fully Rs.l to Rs.l/e/O. which would mean that Indian consumers would be called upon to pay some 2 to 3 Or ores, or say , 300,000/£2,000,000, more per annum for their Oil than they are paying at present, and were the Combine to gain control of the Burmah supplies it is beyond doubt that this additional tribute - the great bulk of which would come out of the pockets of the ryots - would be exacted by them from IndianIndian consumers. As my Board feel that the above points cannot but have a considerable bearing upon the Question now under consideration, they venture to suggest that a copy of this letter should be forwarded to the India Office together with an expression of the views of His Maies- ty *3 Government on the subject.

Grey, was initialled ad referendum . At HaKki's request the blank space was left, as he said he might wish to include something about the 'temettu' tax, though it was pointed out to him that it would be very inconvenient to carry on collateral negotiations here. The accompanying note about irrigation was hanaed to him, and he said he would refer the matter to Constantinople for instructions. As to oil, he pointed out that the National Bank group had a double claim: they had inherited the indisputable rights of the Bagdad Hailway Company under the Convention of 1903 to mines and oil for a distance of 20 kilometres on either side of the line: if say 100 kilometres of the line passed through petroliferous districts, then it meant that the National Bank had a good claim to oil in 40,000 square kilometres Then they had inherited the claims, which were he knew disputed, to oil in virtue of the Agreement of 19041904 •nade by the Anatolian Railway Company. As against this, he contended, there was nothing but an oral undertaking, which should never have been given as it was ultra vires , incurred by Kiamil Pusha who was an old man. That, he contended, was all that Messrs. D'Arcy and Greenway had to go on. % did not assent to this; though it is clear that the Turks consider the National Bank group have the best claim of the two, and that that part of their claim which rests on the convention of March 1903 is of course indisputable. It seems absolutely necessary that the two groups should come to terms if there is to be a settlement. Hakki Pasha said that Dr. Gwinner had asked him if there would be any objection to the Germans tdcing up 10^ of the Turkish share of the new navigation Company: Hakki had said that he would consider the point after consulting us. We told hint that ./he Germans had proposed to us that they should stand out of the navigation on the Euphrates and ilgris. | It seems important not to let the Germans into the Turkish part of the undertaking, at all events un.until we know precisely whether the l^oional Bank, ats a Tiir'Kish institution, intends to continue operations in Turkey and if it would like to come into the Turkish side of the Navigation Company, Te told :lak/Ci I‘as ha that the Egyptian Government, who had been consulted, had no objection to the Turkish Government retaining the option to alter the veto on Egyptian borrowing powers by firman or declaration as they might deem most expedient: the Egyptian Government considered however that it would be more in accordance with precedent if it //ere done by firman.

[June 14.] Section 2. [27272] No. 1. Minute by Mr. Parker. I SAW Sir Henry Babington Smith this morning, in pursuance of the suggestion which was made to him in Sir L. Mallet’s letter of the 13th June. I said that Sir E. Grey had not yet read his letter of the 11th June about the future of the National Bank, and that the matter which I was to mention to him was that of discussions between him and Herr von Gwinner about the Bagdad Railway question, and the extent to which British capital could be interested in it, and on what conditions. Sir Henry Babington Smith said that he was quite prepared to discuss the position tentatively and ad referendum with Herr von Gwinner, though he must explain to him that the discussion would in no way bind the National Bank, whose continuance as a Turkish institution was now very doubtful, and that the sole object of the discussion was to elicit the terms which Herr Gwinner was willing to give in order to attract British capitalists. We agreed that, as Herr Gwinner leaves London to-morrow, it would be advisable for this interview to take place, with the object stated. Sir Henry Babington Smith said that, having regard to the state which the Bagdad negotiations had reached, the National Bank were anxious not to leave us in the lurch by their decision to cease operations in Turkey, and therefore they would be quite prepared to negotiate with Dr. Gwinner, as proposed. I o-athered from him, though we did not discuss this point at any length, that Lord Revelstoke and Sir E.

[2917 y-G][This Dociiment is the Properly of His Britannic Majesty’s Government,] I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your despatch No. 113 of the 21st ultimo transmitting the copy of a letter received by yonr department from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in reply to one which yon caused to he addressed to that company on the 31st March, copy of which was also found enclosed. I had the occasion of s eeing the Grand Vizier on the 5th instant, when I again referred to the subject of the Mesopotamia oilfields. I drew his attention specially to article 22 of the Bagdad Railway convention, which 1 read to him, and pointed out that this article gave the railway company no privileges, no monopolies in the matter of mines, and that others were consequently free to prospect for oil, or, in fact, for any kind of minerals within the 20-kilom. zone of the line. His Highness referred to the Turkish text of the article, and, after having read it, explained that the object of the article in question was to avoid the railway company having privileges or monopolies vis-d-vis the Turkish Government within the 20-kilom. zone, and that such conditions were always inserted in railway conventions for military reasons, but it none the less gave the company certain privileges as regards competitors. To my further contention that the Germans had so far discovered no sources of oil and had not even applied for “permis de recherches” for prospecting in the oil districts, Mahmoud Shevket Pasha stated that oil springs had been discovered in those regions many years ago, and that the arrangement made between the Anatolian Railway Company and the Civil list in 1904 having conferred upon the company the right to work those sources the Germans now naturally claimed that the privileges now acquired by them under this agreement during the former regime of Government must he confirmed by the new. Being unable to follow his Highness in this line of argument, and seeing that a continuation of the discussion of the subject was useless, as it was quite apparent his Highness did not appear to have gone into the matter seriously, I remarked I was adverse to taking up so much of his time and would be glad to know whether there was any official thoroughly conversant with the whole question, as it would, perhaps, be better to discuss the various points with him. Mahmoud Shevket Pasha said that the matter had now become a purely political one, and therefore he was the only person competent to deal with it. Anxious, if possible, to obtain a confirmation of his former statement to me with regard to British participation in the combine he had advocated, I reminded his Highness of his declaration that, in the event of the amalgamation of the British and German groups, he would be prepared to secure a preponderating share for British capital in the new combine ; to this he remarked that he had not meant a preponderating share of capital, but that there should be a British majority on the Board of Administration, and, on my stating that Every much doubted whether such an arrangement would be acceptable, his Highness said that, in any case, he was quite prepared to listen to proposals which might be put forward, but I informed him that this was all premature, as His Majesty’s Government were not disposed to favour the idea of amalgamation. The impression left by this conversation with the Grand Vizier is that he has not studied the question in detail and is, moreover, not disposed to enter into a discussion regarding the validity of German rights supposed to be secured by the agreement of 1904 and the privileges which they may have under article 22 of the convention. Mahmoud Shefket Pasha has again shifted his ground, and now has modified his first statement to me with regard to British participation in the Anglo-German combine he advocated, and in view of his last statement, to the effect that the matter has now become a purely political one, I fear we have for the moment come to a deadlock. Mr. Stock informs me that he has learnt from confidential sources that the Ministry of Mines has been instructed by the Grand Vizier to draw up a draft contract showing the conditions on which the Turkish Government would be prepared to treat for the concession of the working of the oilfields in the Mosul and Bagdad vilayets.

[2917 r— 12] C 1 Sl 82 It would appear that the proposals submitted to the Ministry of Mines bv Mr. Nichols are being taken as a basis for framing the pro jet de contrat, and that the principal conditions which will be laid down are:— 1. That no ground rent will be charged. (Under the mining law an annual taxi of 10 piastres per djerib (10,000 deunums or about one hectare; is levied.) 2. Payment of a royalty of 15 per cent. (It is not clear whether this is a royalty on gross or net output or on net receipts.) ^ 3. That the annual amount of royalty shall not be less than £ T. 100,000. (It is supposed that this amount is to be mentioned in order that the concessionnaires should be compelled to work and develop all the oilfields acquired under the concession.) 4. A time limit of four years will be given, within which the concessonnaires will have to conduct prospecting operations, establish the necessary refining plant, as well as the laying of pipe lines. No royalty will be charged during this period. Great secrecy is being observed by the Minister, who, it appears, in answer to the enquiries of some of the officials of his department as to the names of the persons with whom the Government was about to treat, stated that he was not at liberty to divulge any names, but on being pressed admitted that negotiations with an Anglo-German group were contemplated. . , would therefore seem that the Grand Vizier intends taking some definite course m the matter; whether he intends treating with the German National Bank group oris sanguine enough to believe that his suggestion for the fusion of the German-D’Arcv groups will be acted upon, and that he is preparing for negotiations with this new Anglo-German combine, remains to be seen.

Lowther. The amalgamation of competing interests, which is now suggested by the Ottoman Government, appears to the Board objectionable, as likely (if carried out on a basis of equality) to lead to the absorption of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in the Anglo- Dutch combination (in which German interests are believed to be largely concerned). It is possible, however, that the Anglo-Persian Company might be willing to undertake that, in the event of their securing the concession, they would allow the competing interests to subscribe a proportion (say 40 per cent.) of the capital requisite for working that particular concession, and the Board would have no objection to such a course, provided that satisfactory arrangements were made to prevent that holding from being increased in the future.

WHEN I had the pleasure of seeing you a few days ago, I promised to send you a memorandum regarding the petroleum rights in Turkey acquired by the Turkish Petroleum Company (Limited). This, as you are aware, is the designation of the company formed by our group. I enclose a memorandum, accompanied by a copy of the contract between the Anatolian Railway Company and the Ministry of the Civil List. If any further information or explanations are required in order to make the position perfectly clear, I shall be very happy to give them. Yours sincerelv, H. BABINGTON SMITH. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Memorandum concerning the Petroleum Rights in Turkey acquired by the Turkish Petroleum Company (Limited). (Confidential.) THE Turkish Petroleum Company (Limited) has acquired all the interests and rights of the Deutsche Bank, of the Anatolian Railway Company, and of the Bagdad Railway Company in respect of the prospecting for, the mining, the production, and the refining of mineral oil in the Ottoman Empire in Europe or Asia. These rights include :— 1. The rights arising under the railway concessions. The concessions for the Bagdad Railway and for the Anatolian Railway include the following clause : “Le concessionnaire pourra exploiter les mines qu’il aura decouvertes dans une zone de 20 kilom. de chaque cote de I’axe de la voie en se conformant aux lois et reglements y relatifs, et sans que cela const!tue pour lui un privilege ou un monopole.” This clause does not confer any exclusive rights in the railway zone ; but (a) the Government is bound to grant to the concessionnaires “ permis de recherches ” and firmans for working petroleum within the railway zone, if applied for in accordance with the existing laws and regulations ; (6), the Government is unable to grant exclusive rights for working petroleum within the railway zone to any other parties. 2. The rights arising under the contract of the 4th (17th) July, 1904, between the Ministry of the Civil List and the Anatolian Railway Company relating to the working of petroleum in the vilayets of Bagdad and Mosul. A copy of this contract is annexed. The question of the exact position resulting from this contract has formed the subject of discussions between the railway company and the Government. The Government has expressed the opinion that the rights of the company had lapsed ; but the company has contested this view, and maintained that its rights were still in force. A formal “ protet ” was communicated to the Government by the company in August 1909. In this it was pointed out that, even if it could be established (which they did not admit) that the company’s rights under articles 1 and 2 of the contract had lapsed, article 6 still remained in force, and gave the company not only the right to receive repayment of the expenses incurred, but -also a right of preference on equal terms over any other party applying for a concession to work petroleum in the above-mentioned vilayets.

IN conversation to day with the Grand Vizier I endeavoured to elicit some further information as to the alleged contract which he gave me to understand on the 14th instant had been concluded between the German company and the Ministry of Finance subsequent to the transfer of the rights of the Civil List to the Ministry of Finance after the promulgation of the Constitution, and I asked him whether it would be possible to see this contract. The Grand Vizier immediately qualified his previous statement, and said that he had not intended to say that there had been a new contract, but that the transfer of the concession given by the Civil List was ipso facto carried over to the Ministries under the new arrangement and amounted to a new contract, I observed that under the mining regulations then in force the grant of a general concession for petroleum springs in the vilayet of Bagdad and Mosul would not be in conformity with the law. His Highness replied that this might be so, but that the Government under the Constitution had been compelled to confirm a great many illegalities, and it would have been impossible for them to cancel such contracts. His Highness then again urged very strongly the advisability of bringing about a combination of the rival interests as being the only way of solving the difficulties [by which he found himself surrounded in his desire to fulfil the engagements to which the Ottoman Government was bound and to gratify His Majesty’s Government in granting some concession to Messrs. D’Arcy. His Highness said that in this combination he would be prepared to see that the preponderating share should be British. I asked him how he would guarantee this, to which he replied that he would leave this to His Majesty’s Government who would have to see that the controlling share was British and could take its precautions that it should remain British. His Highness begged me urgently to lay this consideration before you. I have, &amp;c. GERARD LOWTHER.

Anglo-Pcrsian Oil Company to Foreign Office.—(Received April 3.) (Confidential.) Winchester House, Old Broad Street, London, Sir, April 2, 1913. I BEG to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 31st ultimo, enclosing copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople recording a conversation with Mr. E. Whittall, a director of the National Bank of Turkey, on the subject of the oilfields of Asiatic Turkey, and also giving the substance of a telegram since received from his Excellency reporting a statement made by the Grand Vizier as to the rights held by the German group in respect of the Bagdad .Railway Convention. With regard to the latter, 1 would beg to draw attention to the clause of the said convention referring to the right to exploit mines, which reads as follows :— r .r'' ! [April 3.] i C A \ , W W '“if ■ ^ Section 3 . j I 19:3 ; i “ Article 22. Le concessionnaire pourra exploiter les mines qu’il aura decouvertes dans une zone de 20 kilom. de chaque cote de laxe de la voie, en se conformant aux lois et reglements y relatifs, et sans que cela constitue pour lui uu privilege ou un monopole.” From this it will, we think, be evident that the Grand Vizier’s statement that the most valuable oil districts would in any case go to the German group in virtue of the Bagdad Bail way Convention is quite unjustified, inasmuch as the German group have not yet “ discovered” any petroleum mines at all, nor have they complied with the rules and regulations relative thereto, i.e., put in _ applications for any specific mine or mines as required under this article, without which it is quite clear that they cannot claim any “discovery” of oil land. Further, under the terms of the convention it is not, we think, permissible for the German group to “discover” any mines before the railway in question is actually constructed or is m course of construction, because until then it would be impossible for them to show what the delimitations of their “ zone ” would be. Consequently our rights under the assurances given to us by the Turkish Govern ment in 19u9 clearly rank prior to any rights which the German group may consider they hold by virtue of the Bagdad Bailway Convention. We are, of course, quite prepared to recognise any real rights which may exist under the Bagdad Bailway Convention, but, assuming that the Turkish Government carry out their engagements to us, we shall ourselves immediately ^ discover such territory as we may desire to work ; and as there is no reason why this should not be done before the German group will, by the terms of the convention, be in a position to locate any territory, they will, we hold, then only be entitled to claim under the convention such land within their ultimate zone of 20 kilom. as we may not already Commenting on the report of the interview with Mr. E. Whittall, the whole trend of his conversation would, in our opinion, seem to indicate that the German group are not now so confident of success as they pretend, as otherwise they would not be so insistent in seeking to obtain an amalgamation of the divergent interests. # As regards their supposed claims to the concession under the option given them some long time ago by the Civil List, these may be ignored We scarcely think the German group now attach serious importance thereto, as we have just learnt from our representative in Constantinople that M. Huguemn has petitioned the Ministry of Mines for a “ permis de recherche ” for certain territory m Mosul and that he has indicated his willingness to altogether forgo their claims m Bagdad provided this “nermis” is granted. We have requested Mr. Stock to verify this information, as, it true, the obvious conclusion is that the German group realise that they cannot substantiate their claims to the concession as a whole, and are therefore endeavouring to secure, at any rate^a small portion of the od-bearmg land (m Mosul only) by ^ 'Mn Whitt ah’s statement that we would be unable to work the fields, even if we get the concession, is, of course, an absurdity. ; y. [2884 c — 3] 0 f 11 2 O P./I AV ' V1H iX Neither he nor anyone else can tell which are or are not the best fields in the vilayets of Mosul and Bagdad before the ground is actually tested by drilling; and even if the best fields are situated on the ultimate trace oi the Bagdad Railway the German group would, as we have shown above, have no claim to them if they had first been “ discoveredby others. . ,m. x . , , ,, . The suo-o-estion that the railway might charge prohibitive rates and thereby interfere with our successful working of the concession shows great ignorance on the part of Mr Whittall as to the practical working of an oil company, and assumes a supineness to their own interests on the part of the Turkish Government which there are no reasonable grounds for supposing they would display. In the first place, if oil be found in any quantity in Mesopotamia only a very small portion of it could be marketed locally, and for export purposes oil would not be transported by rail, but by the much more economical means of a pipe line. Consequently the question of railway rates or preference would only have a very small^ bearing upon the successful working of the fields by us or by any othei gioup noo associated with the Bagdad Railway. &lt; l . f In the second place, as, under the terms of the proposed concession to us, the Turkish Government have, by virtue of the royalty payable to them, an interest in the successful working of the concession, it is hardly conceivable that they would permit of any prohibitive prices or preferential rates that would in any way militate against this, particularly in view of the fact that article 22 of the convention^ clearly lays down that the mining rights granted thereunder shall in no wmy constitute a privilege or a monopoly. With these views before him we trust that His Majesty’s Minister at Constantinople will be able to combat very strongly the misleading statements made to him by the Grand Vizier, and be in a position to insist in the most emphatic way on the fulfilment of the assurances given in 1909. We very much appreciate the hearty assistance which has been given to us in this Rter by his Excellency, and feel confident, from the evident uneasiness of the German ^ oup, that if a determined stand be now made our negotiations can be brought to a successful conclusion.

(No. Sir, the subject of Mr. D’Arcy’s claim to the concession of the oil-field in the Mosul and Bagdad provinces, and which I have duly reported in previous despatches, all tend to show that Mahmoud Shevket Pasha is inclined to deny the validity of Mr. D’Arcy’s rights, mainly because of the German agreement with the Civil List in 1904, which his Highness now asserts—as reported in my despatch No. 336 of the 21st instant —to have been recognised by the new constitutional Government. His Highness’s urgent advocacy of the amalgamation of the British and German groups for working the oil fields, and his declaration to me that he was prepared to see that the preponderating share in such a combine should be British, seems however to indicate the recognition of certain moral rights acquired by Mr. D’Arcy, coupled with the intention of keeping faith with the Germans. It seems to me that the negotiations on behalf of Mr. D’Arcy have now reached a point not far from a deadlock, and I am apprehensive lest the pressure which may be exerted in favour of the rival groups by ourselves and the Germans may result in determining the Government not to give exclusive rights to either groups. Should the Government act in the sense indicated, and thus nullify the German agreement of 1904 as well as Mr. D’Arcy’s claim, then presumably both Mr. D’Arcy as well as the German group, and, in fact, any outsider, would be free^ to apply for prospecting licences and work, as far as possible according to the mining regulations in force. _ Such a result would, I think, be most disappointing, and on a review of the whole ! situation I am led to think that the declaration made to me by Mahmoud Shevket Pasha with regard to the large share which he would secure to British capital in any participation wfith the Germans, might perhaps form the basis for negotiating on new lines. I cannot, of course, give an assurance that the Grand Vizier is really in a position to ensure to us a preponderant participation ; but, if it should be so, Mr. Stock assures me that such a solution would most likely satisfy Mr. D’Arcy, and I presume that in this case British interests also would be sufficiently safe- The Grand Vizier’s proposal has, however, suggested to my mind another possible solution, and that is that the area over which exclusive rights are demanded by the rival groups should, by an arrangement made between Mr. D’Arcy, the Deutsche Bank, and the Turkish Government, be divided, the Germans taking the vilayet of Mosul and Mr. D’Arcy acquiring the rights over the whole oi the Bagdad province. I &amp; ra T 0 !* aware what the relative importance of these two provinces as oil-bearing districts may be, but I am led to believe that the potentialities of the Bagaad^ pioimce should be important enough to make the position of the Anglo-Persian Oil Syndicate, ; • L • _i_ mu^ Totlnr-c fin.4nr&gt;A fhp Onvfvrn- ment to grant exclusive rights to Mr. D’Arcy over^the oil-fields of Mesopotamia should, I think, be borne in mind, and the alternatives which have been suggested m older to retain an interest in part of the oihbearing districts merit, I think serious con sideration. Should either of the suggestions meet with the approval ol Mr. D Arcy, and be accepted in principle by the Government, I am of the opinion that the presence of Mr. Grtenway in Constantinople, in order to carry on the negotiations with the Deutsche Bank and the Turkish Government, would be most desirable.

WHEN I saw the Grand Vizier on the 14th instant I again urged on his Highness the claims of Mr. d’Arcy’s group to the oil concession in the two Mesopotamian vilayets, and as a story had just come to my ears that the Germans were in possession of a contract made with the Minister of Finance which reaffirmed their rights under the Zander contract, I asked him on what the Anatolian Railway Company based their claim. Mahmoud Shevket Pasha said that a contract such as I have described above was in existence, and that if the Turkish Government knowing of its existence had nevertheless since said that the Germans had forfeited their rights, this line had been adopted merely to induce the Germans to increase their offer, and the English group had been deceived. If the concession were now granted to the latter the Anatolian Railway Company would bring an action for damages against the Government, and would certainly win it. The Grand Vizier went on to urge once more the necessity of combining the rival interests, and he went so far as to hint that it might perhaps be arranged that the controlling share might be secured to the English. I said that a fusion of interests would not suit us, and he replied that this was unfortunate as the Government was anxious to see the industry developed. You will remember that I reported in my despatch No. 257 of the 31st ultimo Gl? that the Grand Vizier had spoken of the existence of a contract having been signed between the Germans and the Minister of Finance at some period subsequent to the Zander contract, but that his Highness’ knowledge of the agreement was so vague that I came to the conclusion that he was alluding merely to the German protest against the annulment of the alleged rights under the Zander contract, a conclusion in which I was confirmed by the positive denial of Mr. Whittall that any such later agreement had been concluded, and by the failure of Mr. Stock to find any trace of it in the dossier at the Ministry of Mines. Although Mahmoud Shevket Pasha gave me no details of the contents of the alleged contract, further than that it reaffirmed the earlier German rights, I am now however disposed to believe that such a document does exist, and I have suggested to Mr. Stock that he should endeavour to get a copy of it at the Ministry of Finance. i Until we are in possession of it, it is of course impossible to judge what the value of this contract really is, but at first sight I am inclined to doubt whether it is worth so much to the Germans as the Grand Vizier would have us believe. On general * grounds it seems to me improbable that, if the document was as binding as it is represented to be, the Grand Vizier would still be negotiating with us, but would reply that it was impossible for him to discuss a concession which had already been granted to another party. Again, it is generally admitted that a petroleum monopoly . for any part of the Empire cannot be legally granted under the existing mining law, and therefore any contract for a monopoly entered into until the law is modified would appear to be ultra vires.

[April 5.] Section 1, [15581] No. 1. Sir G. Lowther to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received April 5.) (No. 257.) Sir, Constantinople, March 31, 1913. I HAD another opportunity of speaking to the Grand Vizier yesterday on the subject of the claim of the Anglo-Persian Oil Syndicate, represented here now by Mr. Stock, and I explained to his Highness that we could not share bis view as to the advisability of an amalgamation which he had suggested in a recent conversation, as reported in my despatch No. 239 of the 24th instant, but that His Majesty’s Government must insist upon the carrying out of the promises made by Hussein Hilmi Pasha, supported, as we believed them to be, by a decision of the Council of Ministers. His Highness, in reply, said that all the researches that had been made had failed to reveal any decision of a Council of Ministers in favour of the English company, and that, if Hilmi Pasha had made any such reference, it could only have been to a discussion in the Council of Ministers and not to a decision of that body. I said that it seemed to me obvious that Hilmi Pasha would nob have continued to negotiate with the English company if the German company still had rights in the matter, to which his Highness replied that a contract existed between the German company, subsequent to the transfer of the Civil List, and the Ministry of Finance, and that, if this were not carried out, the German company would undoubtedly bring an action against the Government, which, in his opinion, they would win. The document to which the Grand Vizier referred is presumably the protest made by the German company against the cancellation of their previous rights. In any case, Mr. Whittall declares that there was no contract beyond the Zander agreement and the above-mentioned protest. There was likelihood, the Grand Vizier said, that if we did not agree to an amalgamation the matter would drag on and neither side might obtain the concession. But, his Highness added, the Turkish Government now appreciated that they might derive very considerable revenues from the exploitation of these petroleum fields, and for this reason he was anxious to see a settlement on the lines he had suggested, namely, amalgamation. I enclose herewith a copy of a letter received from Mr. Stock, reporting a conver sation with the Minister of Mines. It will be observed that the Minister took up a different attitude from that adopted by the Grand Vizier, and implied that the deposits would be given to the highest bidder. The statement of the Minister regarding the action of the Council of Ministers in 1909 is probably a correct one, namely, that no definite decision was taken in favour of Mr. Nichols, but that his proposals were to be favourably considered if no competitor offered better conditions.

I HAVE the honour to submit, enclosed herewith, the report of the interview I had of the Minister of Mines on the 29th. Your Excellency will find it as unsatisfactory as all the interviews have hitherto been. I have been unable to obtain a copy of the 1909 decision of the Council of Ministers to test his statement in regard thereto, and until I can get this it will ^ be difficult to deal with the Minister, though from his tone it is clear that he is not acting on his own initiative, but is simply serving as the Grand Vizier s mouthpiece.

Report of Interview between Minister of Mines and Mr. Stock. AFTER several ineffectual attempts I saw the Minister to-daj and enquired as t the expected reply from the Porte. He stated that no reply had been received. I complained that valuable time was being lost, and that the reply of the Porte ought not to be such a difficult matter in view’ of the existing records of past negotiations. Djelal Bey replied that it must not be thought that the settlement of the question was so easy, as he was determined to turn the oil deposits to the best account for the Imperial Government, and that, in order to arrive at an approximate valuation, he had dispatched delegates to Batoum and Roumania to get an idea of the value of oil lands. On the receipt of the reports of the delegates he would be in a position to deal with the question. 1 objected that it was materially impossible to compare the unproved territory we are dealing with as against the Russian and Roumanian lands. His reply was, applying foreign values to the Mesopotamian areas, he would be satisfied to get one-fifth of such value, and that, in any case, the deposits would go to the highest bidders. I again referred him to the 1909 decision of the Council of Ministers, and stated that I did not see how the concessions could possibly go to any but the group repre sented by Mr. Nichols. In reply to this he said that the Council of Ministers had never decided to grant the concessions, as stated; that all the Council had done was to decide that, unless the Nichols propositions could be bettered, they were to be favourably considered. The Minister definitely stated that this decision clearly left his path open to deal with the highest bidder. I ventured to suggest that I had every reason to believe that Mahmoud Shefket Pasha did not look at the matter in quite the same light. This drew the prompt reply that if there was any interference by the Grand Vizier in his Department’s work he (the Minister) would at once resign. I told him there was no desire to pass over his head, but it was only reasonable to suppose that, as the Council of Ministers had dealt with the matter in the past, it would continue to deal with it in the future, and, as president of that body, Mahmoud Shefket Pasha’s opinions and statements were worthy of consideration. The appearance of visitors put a stop to further discussion. Conclusions. I have to find out if it is true that delegates have been sent to Russia and Roumania in order to test the Minister’s statement under this head. The absence of any desire to negotiate or deal with the question, and the Minister’s statement that the reports of the delegates must be awaited, again shows an intentional delay ing of the business.

WITH reference to my telegram No. 139 of the 11th instant, I have the honour to report that I again to-day approached the Grand Vizier on the subject of the D’Arcy Petroleum Concession, and 1 asked him whether he could now tell me who was the competitor to Messrs. D Arcy to whom he had previously alluded, and explain to me why the Minister of Commerce had not, as I had been informed by Mr. Stock, been able to obtain any reply from the Sublime Porte as to how the matter stood. The Grand Vizier came out into the open and said that the competitor was the British Petroleum Syndicate, a company in great part supported by British capital, but to some extent by German and Dutch, and as the greater part was British, he did not see why it had not the support of His Majesty’s Government. I again explained to him that D’Arcy’s had received promises and assurances from a previous Turkish Government, when it was clearly understood that the German claims had been forfeited, and that D’Arcy’s were therefore really the only company in the field. Indeed, the then Grand Vizier could not have gone so far as he did had he not considered that D’Arcy’s had absolute rights in the matter. The Grand Vizier did not agree with or deny this argument, hut went on to explain the advantages there would be in bringing about an amalgamation of the conflicting interests, much in the same language as that used by Mr. Whittall, as reported m my despatch No. 227 of the 20th instant. His Highness said that, even if the concession were given to D’Arcy’s, he did not see how they could utilise it. The Bagdad Railway had preferential rights over 20 kilom. on either side of the line, and he understood that this would cover the best petroleum fields, and the carrying rights on the railway would always be in the hands of the Bagdad Railway. He gave me clearly to understand that he dreaded a conflict between the two embassies which would place the Turkish Governmeut in an embarrassing situation, and he reminded me of a conversation he had had with me two years ago, in which he deprecated competition in the country between British and German interests, and repeated the hope that means would be found for them to work together and not in opposition. He appeared to have some hopes that the solution might be found in amalgamation. It was clear to me that strong pressure had been brought to bear upon him from the other side. I have, &amp;c.

You are aware of the rights possessed by the Bagdad Railway Company under article 22 of their convention with the Turkish Government, and I am to enquire whether, in the light of that knowledge, your views are in accordance with this presumption.

[March 18.] CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1, / [11393] No. 1. Memorandum communicated to TJakki Pasha, March 18, 1913. IN the spring of 1909 the terms of a contract had been agreed upon, and approved by the Sultan s civil list, between the Ottoman Government, on the one hand, and the representative and local agent at Constantinople (Mr. Nichols) of Mr. W. K. D’Arcy, a British subject, on the other, whereby the right to work the deposits of mineral oil existing in the vilayets of Mosul and Bagdad was assured to Mr. D’Arcy. The Grand Vizier had given assurances that the concession in question would be granted to Mr.^ D Arcy, and had gone so far as to make a recommendation that an Impelial irade should be issued to that effect, when the coup d'Etat which occurred at that time in Constantinople prevented the completion of the transaction. Mr. Stock, the local representative of Mr. DArcy, is at present in Constantinople, and His Majesty’s Ambassador at that capital has been furnished with instructions to afford h im sustained and energetic support in his negotiations. Mr. Stock was granted an interview by the Minister of Mines, who observed to him that the mining laws of the Empire do not permit of privileges such as those which are being sought by Mr. DArcy being granted over such wide territories as the entire vilayets of Bagdad and Mosul. Mr. Stock, however, pointed out that the Council of Ministers had iu the past decided that these privileges should be granted to the ‘‘syndicate represented by Mr. Nichols,” and that it was a “ droit acquis,” and that if Mr. D’Arcy had not moved in the matter recently it was because of the troubles in which Turkey had been involved, beginning with the war with Italy ; but Mr. D’Arcy now felt that the business could not be delayed, and that he must exercise his rights as confirmed to His Majesty’s Ambassador by the Grand Vizier. The Minister thereupon suggested that the difficulty which he had indicated could be overcome by the promulgation of a short special law by the Council of Ministers and by the issue of an irade, and promised to lay the matter at once before his colleagues in the Cabinet. In view of the circumstances above related, and of the expectation long held out to Mr. D’Arcy that the concession would be granted to him, His Majesty’s Government feel confident that the Ottoman Government will recognise his claim, and His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs trusts that his Highness Hakki Pasha will recommend it strongly to the favourable consideration of the Sublime Porte. His Majesty’s Government attach the greatest importance to the solution of this question in the sense indicated, and hope that Hakki Pasha Avill lose no time in telegraphing in this sense to his Government.

IN yonr despatch No. /3 of the hth instant was enclosed a copy of a telegram sent by Mr. Grieenwaj^ to Mi.

I would observe that I have no recollection whatever of any promises having been made directly to me by Hilmi Pasha in this connection. I was not concerned in the early stages of the negotiations, and, as will be seen from my despatch No 674 of the 17th August, 1909,1 only received from his Highness a statement to the effect that the Council of Ministers had “practically” decided to grant the concession, and later on in that despatch I refer to the promises said to have been made by the Sublime Porte to Mr. Nichols, and 1 then expressed the opinion that perhaps Mr. Nichols w r as over-sanguine. Mr. Marling, who was acting charge d’affaires w r hen the question again came forward towards the end of the year, is quite certain that no such promise was made to him. I have, &amp;c.

Lowiher to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received March 15.) (No. 192. Confidential.) Sir, Constantinople, March 10, 1913. WITH reference to the last paragraph of my telegram No. 117 of the 1st March, it is clear that the German syndicate will make a most determined effort to prevent Mr. D’Arcy getting the concession for the oil deposits in question, and their position here at the present moment is very strong. The committee, now in power, has always manifested leanings towards Germany, and the sympathy recently shown in England towards the Balkan allies, wrongly interpreted here as anti-Turkish, combined with the fact that the Germans, through the Deutsche Bank-Anatolian Railway combine, has helped the present Committee Cabinet by granting them financial assistance at a critical moment, has accentuated this pro-German tendency. As in the Lynch affair in 1909, when the Germans were so successful, there is no doubt that German agencies here, direct and indirect, will put forth every effort to secure the oil-fields concession. It would seem that the only strong leverage we have to counteract such efforts are the concessions Hakki Pasha now seems to be unofficially discussing in London in connection with the 4 per cent, customs increase, &amp;c. As His Majesty’s Government, by their communication of the 18th July last, is already committed in the matter, and it may be difficult to add any other desiderata, I ventured to suggest that Hakki Pasha might be given to understand that we attach the greatest importance to the concession being given to us. If, coupled with such a hint, he found that we were indisposed to proceed rapidly with the negotiations, and that the pourparlers dragged on without any apparent serious reason, he and the Ottoman Cabinet would perhaps realise the necessity of giving us satisfaction in the matter. 1 understand that the plan of the committee in the matter of the Balkan war is to endeavour to turn European public opinion into pro-Turkish channels, and that in this connection it has been decided to be most accommodating on all outstanding questions with European Governments, especially those of the Triple Entente. It might perhaps be possible to take advantage of this disposition and anxiety to attain our purpose in the question of the oil-fields concession. It is perhaps unfortunate that Mr. E. Whittall, who is on the board of Sir E. Cassel’s National Bank, should be associated with the foreign-con trolled combine which is opposed to Mr. D’Arcy in a matter of supreme importance to British interests and the vital issue of the naval defence of the Empire.

ON Saturday, the 1st instant, I saw Djemal Bey, Minister of Mines and Commerce, who was expecting me, the Grand Vizier having communicated with him as arranged. I had a cordial and friendly reception, and having opened the subject the Minister said there were difficulties in the way, as the laws do not permit of privileges such as we want over such wide territories as the entire vilayets of Mosul and Bagdad. I told him the Council of Ministers had decided in the past that these privileges would be granted to the “ syndicate represented by Mr. Nichols,” and that it was “ un droit acquis ” ; that if we had not moved in the matter recently it was because of the state of war, first with Italy and at present with the Balkans, and that as peace is now in sight the syndicate had decided to conclude the business and exercise its rights as confirmed to the British Ambassador by the Grand Vizier. The Minister suggested that those formalities were prior to the Chester project, but I objected that that fact only strengthened our position, and that he knew as well if not better than the syndicate that the Chester scheme was quite dead. He appeared to admit this, and suggested that the vilayet difficulty could be overcome by promulgating a short special law through the Council of Ministers and an irade, and that he would bring the matter before his colleagues at once. At this point the Minister raised a point that I expected, i.e., was the syndicate prepared to make a cash advance on account of djerib tax and royalties? He added that he had recently received an offer of £ T. 500,000 for the rights we are now demanding. I suggested that he ought to have accepted such a brilliant offer, but he replied that he was not sure the offer was quite serious. I think he was bluffing. Continuing the conversation, he said the Government was poor and would certainly look for such a facility. I told him that no such thing was provided for in the arrangements made with the Government in the past, and in principle we could not admit such a condition ; but that the syndicate might be persuaded to meet the case, though this could only be in a reasonable amount, and in direct proportion to the present problematic value of the privilege which can only cover unproved lands. I informed him that I was not authorised to discuss this phase of the matter with him as a Government official, but would do so at a later date and when the Government had intimated its readiness to issue the necessary permits. Having pressed the Minister for an early reply from the Cabinet, we arranged for to-morrow (Tuesday). I returned to the office to find Mr. Weakley awaiting me. ^ He told me the Ambassador had received a long and pressing despatch from the Foreign Office wanting to know what had been done, and stating that during this week competitors would make a definite move, and leaving it to the Ambassador to judge of the necessity of acting energetically.2 I// i' if! 11 ! I I • i i Li. ul •? ' VJ (ill s *^ *■ The Ambassador had sent Mr. Weakley over to ascertain what I had done. I gave him full particulars which he communicated to Sir Gerard Lowther, who had arranged to see the Grand Vizier and Foreign Minister yesterday. I expect to hear the result of yesterday’s meeting to-day. -IjM The amount of £ T. 50,000 mentioned as available for an advance or for other0 specific purposes will not, I am afraid, appeal to the Government, and the question arises how far the syndicate go towards a substantial advance on the express condition that it is properly secured, that it bears interest and is repaid in a short period by the djerib tax and royalties, and that if these two items are not sufficient to provide for reasonably early liquidation, the Government to make it up from other sources. There are many concession-hunters and financiers, here and abroad, who are only too ready to come forward with advances in consideration of facilities, and I feel that we shall have to come into line with present requirements if we are to do any satisfactory work. We must not lose sight of the fact that the Government well knows that there are valuable oil deposits in the two vilayets, but what makes the situation difficult is that the officials have such inflated ideas of the value of these deposits. Djavid Bey, ex-Minister of Finance and a very active Young Turk, is now in Europe beating up the markets for money, and I understand he has authority to trade concessions in exchange; one local paper stated that he was authorised to deal with the Chester scheme. I suggest the advisability of carefully considering the necessity of meeting the financial situation on favourable terms in the way of security, interest and repayment and to let me know the maximum that can be granted, it being understood, of course! that it be arranged for the least possible amount. Officially, neither the Ambassador nor the Foreign Office must know of any such arrangement. Touching Djavid Bey’s presence in Europe, I think it necessary that the Foreign Office be induced to instruct the British Ambassador, in whichever capital Djavid happens to be, to hint to him that he must not deal with oil propositions in Mosul or Bagdad : our position could easily be seriously prejudiced by Djavid. The Germans will, without fail, make the most of him while he is in Berlin, and we must not forget that the relations between him and Huggenin are of the most intimate. It will interest you to know that in the file at the Ministry of Mines there is an official communication from the Civil List to the effect that at the time the oil rights were retransferred to the Ministry there was no contract or negotiations pending; in other words, the rights were handed over free and unencumbered. I shall moyennant finance get a copy of this, as it will, I believe, dispose of any German claims. . ^ shall be glad if you v r ill let me have a concise resume of all you did out here, with names as far as possible ; this will be materially helpful. • u T u er l W f ° ne no ^ touched on by us in London, the expenditure necessary with the chief clerk at the Ministry of Mines or at any other department for getting copies of any documents we may require. Men of this class cannot be arranged for on condition of the concessions going through, but must be paid in cash as and when their assistance is required, and leave us to make the best possible bargains. Yours very faithfully, H. W. STOCK. -y. . Jusl returned from Minister of Mines, who has not yet spoken to Grand Vizier; am to go again to-morrow, and shall report to Sir G. Lowther this afternoon.

TY]TH reference to your letter of the 26th ultimo, I have had an interview with the Director of Contracts at which the points raised in your letter were discussed, and at his request I beg to give the following explanations in respect of two of the various proposals which we have had under consideration with a view to overcoming the financial difficulties in connection with the proposed oil-fuel contract, viz. :— 1. Advance payment of 100,000L per annum for the period of the contract in respect of off to be delivered, repayable by deductions of 5s. per ton from the contract price of the oil delivered. The security for repayment of these advances would be— (a,) The deductions from the contract price as above; (h.) The credit of the company; and in order to further safeguard the Government, my directors would also be willing to consider giving a charge, up to the amount of the advances outstanding, on the assets of the company, subject only to the current debenture loan of 600,00QZ. As the Government are, I believe, aware, the properties of the company are, even at the present time, probably saleable for a sum greatly in excess of the liability that would be incurred in respect of the above proposal. The security that would be thus offered is therefore ample. This proposal obviously differs materially from the out-and-out subsidy referred to in the Foreign Office memorandum No. 1 of the 19th November, 1912, but it is much the same in effect as the proposal contained in my letter of the 11th October, addressed to you, with the exception of the above-indicated security. It, however, has the advantage that, the advance payment being a condition of sale common to many contracts, it could presumably be dealt with departmentally, and would not, therefore, be open to the objections which were found to this proposal in its original form. [2839 k—A] / , Q 4 APR 1§13 1 - '2. Guarantee by the Indian Government or by His Majesty s Government of 4 per cent, per annum on the 2,000,000L additional capital which it is estimated would be required to carry out the proposed contract. It was originally proposed that this guarantee should be given for the period of the contract, but my directors now think that it may be possible to raise the required capital on a guarantee for a period of ten years ; but this is a point to which they cannot definitely commit themselves at the moment. As in the “advance” proposal, the amount paid by the Government in respect of the guarantee will be repayable by deductions at the rate of 5s. per ton on the quantity of oil delivered. This proposal would only involve a total risk of 800,000L, less the amount repayable in respect of the oil delivered, and the whole amount would be covered in about nine years, with deliveries at the rate of 350,000 tons per annum.

VVliH reference to the message received from His Majesty’s Minister at Constantinople on the subject of the Mesopotamian oil concession which Mr. Parker kindly communicated to me last evening, I beg to point out that the assurances given to His Majesty’s Ambassador by the Grand Vizier that the Council of Ministers had decided to grant the concession to us were made subsequent to the transfer of the said properties to the Minister of Finance. As regards the Sublime Porte’s contention, that “ the application made to the Civil List and on the spot without result before transfer of its properties to the Minister of Finance in 1909 would by fact of that transfer be considered null and void,” if this is accepted as correct, it follows ipso facto that the claims of the Anatolian Railway Company under the option granted to them by the Civil List cannot possibly be substantiated. As soon as the properties were transferred to the State, a letter was addressed to the Grand Vizier to the effect that— (1.) Mr. Nichols had applied to the Civil List for the right to work the petroleum deposits of the vilayets of Bagdad and Mosul; (2.) That the convention thereof had been submitted to his Highness; (3.) That it had practically been accepted by the said Ministry; and (4.) In conclusion the Grand Vizier was asked to issue orders to the proper department so that the necessary formalities could be concluded as soon as possible. This letter was dated the 25th Nissan, 1325 (8th May, 1909), and was signed by Mr. R. Whittal in the absence of Mr. Nichols, as his representative. This letter was handed to the Grand Vizier on that date, and he at once referred the matter to the Minister of Finance with the request that he would do the needful at once. Thereupon, the Minister of Finance immediately requested the Civil List to forward to him the dossier of the business, including the draft of our convention, and the whole question was discussed at subsequent meetings of the Council of Ministers. As stated above, it was at this stage that the Grand Vizier gave the assurances to His Majesty’s Minister. With reference to the Porte’s statement that the mines can only be granted subject to the provisions prescribed by the regulations now in force, we are prepared to accept the concession on the understanding that it is subject to the existing and any future mining laws that may be promulgated, on the condition that any taxes or other imposts payable thereunder shall only be leviable in respect of such land as may be occupied by us for exploratory or drilling purposes,, and we instructed Mr. Stock to this effect verbally before his departure and confirmed same in writing on the 21st ultimo. All negotiations with the various Ministries were conducted by Mr. Nichols in his name as representative of the British group, and Mr. D’Arcy’s name was not mentioned to the Turkish officials.

My Lords are quite willing to join in a meeting of representatives of the Foreign Office, India Office, and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to discuss the suggestions which the company indicate that they could put forward as alternative to those already commented on in Admiralty letter of the 28th December, 1912, in which the objections to any proposal of a direct subsidy or to making any suggestion to the Secretary of State for India for any indirect subsidy were pointed out. 2. The Admiralty have recently entered into a contract with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company for 30,000 tons of fuel oil to be delivered in 1913-14, subject to certain stipu lations as to the quality of the oil, and a proposal from the company for a long term contract for large quantities is at present engaging attention. A number of considera tions arise on this latter proposal which cannot be disposed of immediately but no time is being lost in going fully into the matter with a view to making a definite reply to the company at the earliest possible date, probably within the next two or three weeks. Unless the necessity for a meeting has become one of exceptional urgency my Lords are of opinion that it would be preferable from their point of view to defer the proposed meeting until the company have received a reply from the Admiralty on the question of a forward contract. 3. Possibly in the interval the Secretary of State for India may be able to obtain from the Indian Government some expression of their views generally and in particular in regard to the possibility of utilising Persian fuel oil for Indian railways. It appears very doubtful, however, whether the India Office can be expected to give an opinion at present having regard to Mr. Greenway’s remarks as to the probable duration of the tests that the railway board appear to be conducting. The possibility of taking more ! effective action could undoubtedly be strengthened if the India Office as well as the Admiralty could enter into contracts for use of Persian oil on its merits for the services in which the two departments are respectively interested. 4. With regard to Mr. Greenway’s suggestion of a contract with advanced payments, the proposal as far as can be judged on the outline given by Mr. Greenway seems to differ but little in substance from the previous proposal of a subsidy which my Lords have not felt able to entertain. Further explanation may conceivably put the proposal in a different and more favourable light or one of the alternatives may possibly prove more acceptable. To ascertain whether this is likely to be the case my Lords are communicating with the company as in letter of which a copy is enclosed herewith. 5. A copy of this letter and enclosure is being sent to the India Office. I am, &amp;c. W. GRAHAM GREENE. Enclosure in No. 1. Admiralty to Anglo-Persian Oil Company. Sir, Admiralty, February 26, 1913.

Certain points, however, arise which prevent them from [2804 dd—A] t 13 MARI 3 copy 14 [VIA-. 1013 t SECi.c : V : ii !2 giving an immediate reply to your proposal to the Admiralty, but no time is bein 1 in the matter, and my Lords hope to reply definitely within two or three weeks ° ° St In the meantime they desire some further information in respect of the nrono 1' regard to the payment of advances under an Admiralty contract.

Sir, Foreign Office, February 24, 191 WITH reference to your letter of the 17th instant, and your interview at this Office on the following clay, in connection with the negotiations for an oil concession for Mosul and Bagdad, I am directed by Secretary Sir E.

The Grand Vizier had given assurances that the concession in question would be granted to Mr. D’Arcy, and had gone so far as to make a recommendation that an Imperial irade should be issued to that effect, when the coup cVldtat which occurred at that time prevented the completion of the transaction. The local representative of Mr. D’Arcy leaves London for Constantinople in a few days with a view to pursue the matter, and His Majesty’s Ambassador at that capital has been furnished with stringent instructions to afford him sustained and energetic support, and to arrange for his reception by the Grand Vizier at an early date. In view of the circumstances above related and of the expectation long [held out to Mr. D’Arcy that the concession would be granted to him, His Majesty’s Government feel confident that the Ottoman Government will recognise his claim, and His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs trusts that his Highness the Turkish Ambassador will recommend it strongly to the favourable consideration of the Sublime Porte.

A1 _ i W inchester House, Old Broad Street, London, Dear Mr. Parker, January 23, 1913. WITH reference to your request for particulars of the specific grounds upon which our claim to the Bagdad-Mosul concession is based, I am informed by Mr. Nichols that these are as follows :— 1. In April 1909 the details of our convention were all settled in principle and approved_ of by the Grand Vizier, application had been made to the palace for the Imperial iradd, and but for the mutiny that occurred in that month and the subsequent events the irade would undoubtedly have been signed. 2. In June 1909 the then Grand Vizier himself assured Sir G. Lowther that the Council of Ministers had decided to grant the concession to us (see Sir Louis Mallet’s letter of the 28th June, 1909, to Mr. D’Arcv). 3. Statements of a favourable nature were,' I understand, also made to His Majesty’s Ambassador by a subsequent Grand Vizier. 4. Similar promises were repeated from time to time to Mr. Nichols by several of the Ministers and officials attached to the various departments. Mr. Nichols has been assured on many occasions since 1906 by all the competent Turkish officials that any rights which may have been granted to the Socibtd Chemin de Fer d’Anatolie under the option dated the 16th July, 1904, had lapsed, and that the Turkish Government were absolutely free to deal with them in any way they chose, and, as a matter of fact, the Turkish Government have since been negotiating for the disposal of them, or portions of them, to different parties in connection with railway schemes (e.g., the “Chester,” the “Glascow,” the “Prince Ibrahim” schemes), and several small “permits des recherches” have been actually issued by the Minister of Mines. During the whole of this time no really serious steps appear to have been taken by the Socffite Chemin de Fer d’Anatolie to establish a recognition of their claim under the above option, and it is only recently, consequent upon the formation of the Deutsche Bank, National Bank, and Shell combination, that they have shown any activity in the matter, their policy up till this period having been purely one of a “dog in the manger ” character. A further ground to the concession may, I think, be very justly claimed in respect of the large amount of money and time which we have already expended in connection with this matter, relying, as we have done, on the numerous promises and assurances which we have from time to time received to the effect that the concession would be granted to us. Yours truly, C. GBEENWAY. P.S.—I will reply to your letter of yesterday in the course of a day or two. C. G.

(No. 28.) ^ ir ’ Constantinople, January 12, 1913. 1 the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your despatch No. 565 of the 13th ultimo, m which was enclosed copy of a letter from Messrs. Murrieta and Co., as also a c ®Py a document prepared by Count Ostrorog, bearing on the question of Tahsm asha s concession, and on the subject-matter of which observations are invited. From information we have, it appears that Tahsin Pasha’s claim is based on a permis de lecherches, or prospecting licence—and not on a concession—which was issued to him by the Bagdad authorities in 1898 (1313) on instructions from the Ministry of Mines. The licence, which permits prospecting operations for one year onl}-, authorised Tahsin Pasha in general terms to prospect for petroleum in the vilayet of Bagdad, and was not drawn up in accordance with the mining regulations. The omission of certain details in the licence, required by those regulations, does not, however, seem to have affected the validity of the document at the time, for Tahsin Pasha was able during the same year to carry out prospecting work for over seven months, but was obliged to discontinue his investigations in consequence of the issue of an Imperial irade by bultan Abdul Hamid, which granted the concession of all oil-fields found in the Empire to the Ministry of the Civil List. Tahsin Pasha’s permis de recherehes was ignored, and his right to continue prospecting work during the unexpired term of his licence was arbitrarily swept away by the issue of this irade, and besides his right under the mining regulations to put in a demand for the concession of the mines and oil-fields explored was cancelled. Tahsin Pasha does not seem to have been able to take any steps, but is said to have entered a protest against the agreement made in 1904 between the Civil List and the Anatolian Railway Company regarding the survey and eventual working of the oil-fields of Mosul and Bagdad, and at the same time claimed his rights. On the change of Government in 1908, the right over the oil-fields was withdrawn from the Civil List, and passed under the control of the Ministry of Mines, and Tahsin Pasha seems then to have brought his claim to the notice of that department. His claim was referred by the department to the Council of State for a decision, but unfortunately for Tahsin Pasha all the documents relative to the case were lost or burnt in the fire which broke out and destroyed part of the building of the Sublime Porte. A great deal of time was necessarily taken in procuring copies of the lost documents, and in the reconstruction of the dossier, but this having been done, the Council of State proceeded to the examination of the whole question. Although on two occasions the council seem to have been ready to recognise the justice and validity of Tahsin Pasha’s claim, the final decision of the Council of State has been given against Tahsin Pasha on the ground that the “permis ” issued to him was irregularly drawn up, and that whatever rights Tahsin Pasha may have acquired under that “permis ” were annulled by the Imperial irade. Tahsin Pasha has, I hear, appealed against this decision, and has petitioned the Grand Vizier, so that his case will now be examined by the Council of Ministers. With regard to the request made by Messrs. Murrieta in their letter, that assistance might be afforded by His Majesty’s Embassy for establishing Tahsin Pasha’s rights, I would beg to point out that the question at issue is not, as far as I am aware, one between a British subject or company and the Turkish Government, but one in which a Turkish subject is endeavouring to obtain the recognition and restitution by his own authorities of certain rights granted to him in 1908 under a prospecting licence. It has not transpired from the correspondence, nor have I understood that Messrs. Murrieta or the group interested have been officially recognised through their local agents as principals in the matter, or that the official negotiations for the recognition of rights acquired under the licence have been conducted in their name or by them. These negotiations throughout have been, I understand, carried on by [2759 5—3] 13 MARI SI COPY R1913 t SECRETARY'S IMJ * ‘2 Tahsin Pasha, or on his behalf and in his name, and under such circumstances 't would, I think, be impossible for His Majesty’s Embassy to intervene. The opinion given by Count Ostrorog on the question of the validity of Tah ' Pasha’s rights seems to be a correct exposition of the legal aspects of the case should prove useful in the negotiations which Tahsin Pasha has now entered into the Porte. I would add that from recent information it appears that Tahsin Pasha has entered into no negotiations with any person or company for the sale of his rights and is bound to the syndicate represented by Mr. Thomson.

[[February 18.] Section 1. Enclosure in No. 1. Hxtracts from a Letter received by Mr. H. E. Nichols from a Correspondent in Constantino pie. MY friends at the Ministry of Mines have handed me a copy of an application to the said ministry signed by a member of the Board of Managers of the National Bank of Turkey, Mr. E. Whittall, the summary of the contents being as follows :— “ In accordance with a former agreement and the special clauses of the railway concession of the Anatolian Railway Company, the right of working the oil mines situated in the Moussoul and Bagdad districts was granted to the said company. By a special arrangement these rights have been transferred to us, and we, therefore, hereby ask for the concession of working the said petroleum mines.” The Minister of Mines, in order that he may be in a position to deal with this request, has written a letter to the Minister of Public Works asking for particulars of the above-mentioned rights claimed by the Anatolian Company, to which the Ministry of Public Works replied briefly to the effect “ that the Minister does not know, neither has he found in the conventions of the Anatolian Company, any clause or disposition granting to them the right of working the oil mines alluded to.” The Ministry receiving this reply will be obliged to put the matter aside in view of the above, whilst, on the other hand, the earlier orders of the Sublime Porte that the Ministry is not to deal with the petroleum mines will also prevent them from taking the initiative. I know, however, as a fact, that now that the Committee of Union and Progress is in power, and seeing that two of the influential members of the committee are on the board of management of the National Bank they will try again, taking new and more effective steps, to secure recognition of these rights, directly or indirectly, by the State Departments. I may add that some of the superior officials of the Mining Department have been promised “ satisfactory remuneration ” if the affair succeeds.

I HAVE read with interest the minute by Mr. Hurston the subject of the German claims to oil concessions in Mesopotamia which you were good enough to forward to me in your despatch No. 575 of the 23rd of this month, and am in agreement with the conclusions arrived at by Mr. Hurst. I would point out that we have never had any documentary evidence from Mr. Nichols to prove that the German rights under the 190J convention have lapsed. The impression has always been that the Germans have based their claim on their convention with the civil list, and certainly the last article of that agreement, which gives the Germans a preferential right, would in itself dispense with the necessity of a new arrangement. The Germans should, in my opinion, be pushed into the open in this matter, and this could be done by Mr. D’Arcy, w T hose agent ought to be here to maintain his claims to the oilfields, and to insist upon the fulfilment of the promises which he has, as he maintains, received.

Foreign Office, February 20, 1913, 5 p.m. Mr. STOCK, local representative of Messrs. D’Arcy and Greenway, is returning to Constantinople on Monday, and I have to instruct your Excellency to arrange for a private interview between Mr. Stock and the Grand Vizier at an early date in regard to the oil concession in Mosul and Bagdad. As you are aware, I have been advised that, on the terms of the 1904 agreement between the Anatolian Company and the Civil List alone, there is no reason to assume that the Germans have a secure title to an option. Moreover, in the spring of 1909 the terms of a contract had been virtually agreed to by the Ottoman Government on the one hand and the lawyer (Sir Edwin Pears) and local agent of Mr. D’Arcy on the other. The Grand Vizier had given assurances that the concession would be granted, and his Highness had gone so far as to issue a recommendation that an irade should be promulgated when the coup d'Etat took place. In view of these circumstances, and the expectation long held out to Mr. D’Arcy that the concession would be granted to him, His Majesty’s Government feel confident that the Ottoman Government will recognise the claim of Mr. D’Arcy now definitely advanced, and I have to request your Excellency to afford Mr. Stock your sustained and energetic support, as it is a matter of supreme importance to British interests that these oilfields should not pass into the hands of a foreign-controlled combine. I understand that a definite application has only recently been put forward by Mr. Whittall on behalf of such a combine, which appears to have succeeded to the ■claims of the Anatolian Railwmy Company.

I BEG to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 5th instant, conveying confidentially the views of the Admiralty on the proposals recently put before His Maiesty’s Government by my company. _ p T Before replying to the point referred to in the earlier part of your letter, 1 am desired by my board to say, with reference to the last four paragraphs, that the desire expressed by Sir Edward Grey that this company may not find it necessary to combine with the Shell Company is shared very strongly by myself and by every one of my colleagues, and that it is solely for this reason that we have been endeavouring to seek for some practicable means of maintaining the purely British character of the company. At the same time, however, I am desired again to point out that the matter is one of considerable urgency, as, although we have managed so far to put off the Shell Company by excuses of one kind and another (in whicli we have been helped by the fact that our entry into the market has been somewhat delayed owing to late deliveries of some plant), yet that within a short time we shall, by the exigencies of our position, be forced into coming to a decision one way or the other. Should we unfortunately be unable to withstand this pressure we shall do our utmost to exclude contracts with the Admiralty from any such agreement, but, as you will have seen from the copies of the correspondence between Mr. Cohen, of the Asiatic Petroleum Company (Limited), and myself, beginning with a letter dated the 15th October 1912, and concluding with one dated the 24th October, 1912, of which I have submitted copies for your confidential information, this condition would be very strongly resisted by the Shell Company, and it may be impossible for us to insist upon it. As regards the proposed granting of a subsidy by His Majesty’s Government, my board quite appreciate that there may be difficultiespn the way that are insurmountable, but they desire me to point out that it is, they think, scarcely correct to say that the Admiralty are asked to embark upon a policy of finding 2,000,0001. of capital, inasmuch as it could, of course, be stipulated that the annual amount should only be payable so long as the company was duly carrying out the conditions of the contract. Therefore the only risk that could be involved would be that of the amount actually paid in advance of deliveries of oil. . . i i i As regards the proposal that the financial assistance to the company should be provided by means of an Indian Government guarantee (of say 3 per cent, to 3^ pei cent, per annum) on the 2,000,0001 of additional capital that it is estimated would be required, it is quite true that this would be practically asking foi a subsidy fiom India for the benefit of Imperial services; but this also, for the leason given m the last paragraph, is a subsidy more in name than in effect, since the interest guaranteed would be repayable by the company annually out of the amount due by the Admiralty on account of the oil delivered, and the only risk involved would be that of the company s But the granting of this small assistance to the Imperial services would, my board venture to suggest, b°e a very right and proper one for India to make to the Imperial Navy, more particularly m view of the great importance to India, both politically and strategically, of maintaining the purely British character of this impoitant commercial interest in Southern Persia. . So far, as regards the adoption by the Indian Government of Persian oil m place of coal for use on Indian railways, I am pleased to report that as the result of representa tions by my company the Railway Board have now authorised extensive tests and trials in comparison with coal, but, though there is but little doubt that these will demonstrate the superior advantages of oil, the question of whether or not the Indian Government eventually decide upon the use of Persian oil for railway purposes will not help to [2804 n—1] ^ 14FEB191solve the present difficulty, as it will be eighteen months to two years before th of these tests and trials can be shewn. le resil lt8 Therefore, the proposal as to the giving of a guarantee by the Indian Gove is one that must, presumably, be judged solely from the point of view of whether ment India can properly be asked to make this (nominal) contribution to the Imperial N ^ and on this question my board fear that any representations made b v them 1+7’ India Office will be of no avail unless at the same time some strong indication ° ^ given that such assistance would be welcomed by His Majesty’s Government ^ But, as represented by me at my last interview with Sir Louis Mallet’ if n +• the proposals so far put forward by us is felt to be practicable, there are ffiven *7- on the part of His Majesty’s Government to preserve the British control of the vZT oilfields, probably half-a-dozen alternative ways in which this could be achiever! • 7 if a meeting could be arranged at which some members of my board and snot , ’ u of the Government and [or] of the Admiralty Board as arl (Teah^ could meet together to discuss the various alternatives at a “ round table conferenre ” some solution could no doubt be found. emnce, For example, one suggestion which I put forward at my interview with Sir Tn • Mallet was that a contract should be entered into between the Almhaliy and “v company on the lines proposed in my letter dated the 20th ultimo—one of rll stipulations of this contract being that the Admiralty should each year pay 100 00M on account of the oil subsequently deliverable. This is quite an ordinarLonditio! of commercial contracts, and m effect would mean that, from the time that we begin the large amount of expenditure (for additional field development, pipe lines and refineries! that would be required to implement the contract--!.e., ‘‘lay the keel' of th extension of our busmess-we should be paid 100,0001. peii annum on account of it money expended which sum (at the rate of 5*. per ton) ‘would go in reduction of the amount payable for the oil we have delivered. Such an arrangement might, my board think, enable them to raise the additional capital that would be required to meet a contract of the nature of the one S consideration, and at the same time remove the one obstacle that stands in the wav of t e company maintaining its independence. ^ r„ m , AS t /T- ra - att J e , r , is on , e of g reat importance—not only to the Ando-Persian Oil Company (Limited), but also, we venture to think, to His Majesty’s Government ami rid o se o e hfr: ;: gency ’ my board r uid ^ * Ir iz' Xot quest L Z.WbeT gmg F ea u rly me6tin g’ 88 ™ggested above, at which the Tf deXT^th thLLfffl n U88ed ’ W ' th a V ‘ eW t0 tr ^ in g find some practicable way Government nor be open toVohticafobjeTtXs W ° Uld Deither ^ 0ner ° US t0 I have, &amp;c.

The British Steamship “ Ayr ”, now loading at Basrah was consigned to Asfar &amp; Co , (Mr. Asfar is a Chaldean under French protection) by Messrs. Marcus Samuel &amp; Co., and the S.

With reference to your letter of the 4th ul.imo &gt; relative to uhe exploitation of oilfields in Mesopotamia and Persia, I am directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to inform you that the managing director of the Angle- Persian Oil Company called at this Office on one eon ultimo and had an interview with Sir L. Mallet on the subject. Mr. Greenway informed Sir L. Mallet that if His Majesty's Government were successful in obtainirg tne Mesopotamian concession for his Company they would be in a position to refuse the offer of amalgamation made to them by the Shell Company. He then asked whether the Admiralty had replied as to the conclusion of a contract with his Company and on being informed of their refusal to do so, s^d that, in that case the amalgamation of his Company with the Shell Company was inevitable ever, if trie Mesopotam ian concession was secured by the former. he Under Secret-faxy of State, India Office.r ( 2462 / 13 ). 25 ^) Sir L.

Mallet thereupon observed that in these circumstances there was no use in sending instructions to His Majesty*s Ambassador at Constantinople to sup- port the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in their efforts to obtain the Mesopotamian concessions and that he should accordingly recommend Sir E. Grey no longer to do so. Mr. Greenway said that if his Company had the support of His Majesty* s Government they would be in a much better position for making good terms with the Shell Company. Sir L. Mallet said that the sole preoccupation of His Majesty’s Government was that his Company 1 s Persian concession, embracing as it did all the oilfields of Persia, which were largely situated on the Persian Gulf, should not pass under me; control of c*. foi sign syndicate. He reminded Mr. Greenway of his Company’s professions of imperialism and of the support which His(2463/13). His Majesty's Government had hitherto given to them and stated*that Sir E. Grey had been much surprised to learn-that persons of the standing of Lord Strathcona and Mr. d'Arey should actually propose to enter into such an arrangement. when it appeared that a marketing agreement, i.e., one for the sale of the oil at a certain price, would amply suffice to meet the case. Mr. Greenway said that he himself would strongly oppose amalgamation with the Shell Company and there is reason to believe that, if sufficient pressure is exercised by His Majesty's Government, the Anglo- Persian Oil Company will not go beyond a marketing agreement with them. Sir L. Mallet suggested that such an agreement might be made for five years after which it might be to the interest of the Admiralty to make a contract with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, ouc Mr. Greenway said that such an agreement would have to be for ten years. Mr. Greenway informed Sir L. Mallet that the Snell Company were in negotiation with Lord Cowdrey in con nexion with the exploitation of the Mexican oilfields and(2463/13). and tnat there was no doubt that the absorption of His Lordship's interests by the Company was only the matter of a very short time. I am to draw the special attention of the Marquess of Crewe to this last statement which appears to Sir E. Grey to be of special importance. I am to transmit to you herewith copy of a letter which Sir E. Grey has caused to be addressed to Mr. Greenway setting forth the views of the Admiralty on this subject ana to observe that this Office could only support a proposal to subsidise the Anglo-Persian Oil Company if Lord Crewe and the Lords Commissioners were able to show good grounds for doing so.

They point out that you are fully aware that cheap Indian carl will necessarily remein a formidable competitor with oil on some of the Indian Hallways and therefore if the Persian oil products cannot be adopted on their merits either forlnaian B&amp;iiwry purposes, or for other purposes for the beneiit of the Indian consumer, the Admiralty in inviting the India Office to take up the question of subsidy would oe practically asking(£465/13) asking for a subsidy from India to your Company in- directly for the benefit of Imperial Services.

If in addition continued diplomatic(2463/13) &amp; diplomatic support is given to the Company in respect of the iviesopotamian concessions in order to avoid if possible the bringing of other Foreign influence into the Persian fields, the Admiralty are of opinion that, apart from any political considerations which might justify more exceptional measures, as much Governmental support as present circumstances admit would bo given to the preservation of the commercial independence of the Anglo-Persion Company. The Admiralty regret any extension of influence which may tend to a greater monopoly in the oil fuel market by powerful conbinations, but th^y have to con sider from the purely Admiralty point of view in each case whether Admiralty interests would be so jeopardised as to necessitate the consideration of the large ques tion of subsidizing commercial ecmpanies, - a policy v/hich they have hitherto declined to entertain in other cases and which if once begun would probably have to be extended, - and they consider that it is at present very difficult to say in regard to any oilfield, however Important(2463/13). important in certain eventualities it micht become, whether it is likely to stand in any absolutely pre eminent or exclusive- position from the Admiralty point of view. I am however to express Sir E.Grey’s strong hope that your ComprAiiy will not find it necessary to combine with the Shull Company. I am to observe that the support 'which His Majes ty’s Government have given to your Company in the past, both in obtaining their concussion in Persia and in other ways, was given on the understanding that the enterprise would .remain British and it would be a matter of great surprise and regret if your Company made any arrangement whereby a syndicate predominantly foreign obtained control of their interests In that country. I am to point out that, in such t contingency, your Company could not of course hope to obtain from His majesty’s Government the some support as in the past. I am to add that while, in the contrary case, your Company would continue to enjoy in Persia the treatment hitherto accorded to theia by His Majesty’s Government, there(2463/13) there is some reason to suppose that the German claliiis to the viesopoteunian concjssion ^ rest on a more sub stantial foundation tiian was at first imagined. The infonimtion at present available with regard to the precise nature of these claUts is however incomplete, and His Majesty's Government consider it worth your Company's while to make every effort at Constantinople to obtain the concession and ¥vill afford you their full diplomatic support.

Lowther to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received December 28.) Constantinople, December 22, 1912. WITH reference to your teleoram No. 1092 of the 6 th instant, on the subject of the concession of the Mesopotamian oil-fields applied for by Mr. D’Arcy, and the communication which you desired me to make to the Turkish Government in favour of Mr. I) Arcy s claim to the concession, I have the honour to report that I took the opportunity afforded at an interview which 1 had with the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 10 th instant of bringing the matter to his Excellency's notice. I reminded Gabriel Effendi that the question of the concession of the oil-fields in the Mosul and Bagdad \ilayets had been the subject of negotiations between Mr. D’Arcy’s represen- tative and the Ottoman Government for a number of years, and that the attitude observed by the Government throughout these negotiations had been such as to give some encouragement to believe that a satisfactory basis would be found for giving the concession to Mr. D’Arcy. I informed Gabriel Effendi that His Majesty’s Government expressed the hope that, in view of the efforts which had been made by Mr. D’Arcy, the concession in question would be given to no other concession- naire, and that Mr. D’Arcy’s rights to work those oil-fields would be fully recognised and granted. Gabriel Effendi intimated that he had no knowledge of the question, nor, as far as he was aware, had it come before the Cabinet, and that it was a matter which concerned the Ministry of Mines and Forests. He enquired whether the ques tion of granting a concession had recently been raised, and what was the object of my representations at the pres mt moment. As you are doubtless aware, the consideration which was given by the Government to the railway project submitted by Mr. Chester rendered it impossible for Mr. D’Arcy to go on with his negotiations, and the final decisions of Government and Parliament with regard to this railway scheme had to be awaited. In my despatch No. 318 of the 14th April last I had the honour to report on the position cf the Chester scheme and the disinclination of the American group to continue their negotiations in view of the very onerous conditions on which the Government proposed to grant the Youmurtalik concession. The general political situation, and the changes of Ministry which have taken place since last April, have not been favourable to the consideration anew of Mr. Chester’s project, and it would be difficult to determine the views which the present Cabinet holds with regard to that scheme. It must also be observed that frequent changes at the Ministry of Mines have taken place since Mr. Nicols, Mr. DArcy’s repre sentative, last treated for the concession of the Mesopotamian oil-fields, and it is exceedingly unlikely that the present Minister has any knowledge of Mr. Nicols’ application or of his negotiations with the department. Because of these circumstances, and of the fact that, in the view of His Majesty’s Government, it is highly desirable that the concession of these oil-fields should, if possible, be in British hands, I venture to think it very essential, in view of any repre sentations which may have to be made by His Majesty’s Embassy, that Mr. D’Arcy’s representative should be in Constantinople to resume his relations with the Mining Department.

I have, &amp;c. GERARD LOWTHER, Enclosure in No. 1. Memorandum by Mr. Weakley. (Confidential.) I SAW Mr. Edwin Whitall this morning on the subject of the rights of the Germans to the Mesopotamian oil-fields. He said that, for the private information of the embassy, he would state that a company had recently been formed for acquiring the rights over all the petroleum-fields in Turkey in Asia and to work them. The group consisted of the Royal Asiatic Company, the Batavian Company, the Deutsche Bank, the National Bank of Turkey, the Shell Transport Company, as well as other firms interested in petroleum, and this new company had taken over the rights of the Anatolian and Bagdad Railways in respect of the 20-kilom. zone on either side of the railway lines conceded by the conventions, as well as those over the petroleum-fields which had already been acquired by the Deutsche Bank. He was a director of the new company, and was associated with Mr. Gunther, the sub-director of the Anatolian Railway Company, in looking after the new company’s affairs in Constantinople. D’Arcy had been working for a number of years to obtain the concession of the Mesopotamian oil-fields, but beyond a verbal promise which, Mr. Whitall understood, Nichols had got from Hussein Hilmi Pasha when Grand Vizier, D’Arcy’s negotiations had not led to anything. (In fact, D’Arcy had done nothing for the last two or three years, and it would seem as though he had retired from the field altogether.) Mr. Whitall had written to London suggesting that D’Arcy might be approached with a view to his joining the new company, which was practically a British concern, as he thought that about 75 per cent, of the capital would be British. Mr. Whitall thought some negotiations had already taken place with D’Arcy, and that there had been some hitch, but he had no knowledge of what had occurred. With regard to German rights to the concession of the Mesopotamian oil-fields, Mr. Whitall said he was thoroughly conversant with the question, as he had all the dossier dealing with the subject. If the infoi mation required on the matter was purely for the information of the embassy, he was prepared to give all the details, but if it was to be used, it was only natural, that as a director of the company, he was unable to say anything. He would, however, state that the Germans had carefully followed all the phases of the question, and taken such steps has had appeared necessary to protect their rights, which were absolutely secure, more than this he could not say. Nichols, whilst in Constantinople, had obtained an idea of the drift of the corre spondence which had been exchanged between the Government and the Germans, but Mr. Whitall did not think Nichols had seen any of the documents, nor had he obtained copies of them. Nichols, however, had no knowledge of the correspondence exchanged subsequently, after he hacLI^j 1 ^o^tantinople. December 27, ie E.

Admiralty, S.W., Sir, 2Uth March 1912. I am commanded by My Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to inform you, for the information of the Secretary of State for India in Council, that a communication has been received from the Anglo- Persian Oil Company, Limited, representing that it would materially facilitate the working of the Company and “ consequently promote “ the production of oil fuel for Navy purposes by a purely British “ Company,” if the Government of India were to adopt oil fuel in substitution for coal on the State Railways in Western India, as the Company would thereby secure a certain market for oil fuel and be encouraged to incur further capital outlay in the development of their extensive oilfields, and in making additions to their refineries to enable them to contract with the Admiralty for large supplies of such fuel. The Company urges that as fuel oil cannot be remuneratively shipped from the Persian Gulf to markets west of the Suez Canal in competition with oil produced from the Russian and Roumanian oilfields, the only likely outlet for Persian oil, other than the Admiralty, is with the Indian Railways. The Company contend that in the matter of cost, Persian oil will have no difficulty in competing with Indian coal as a fuel on the Western Indian Railways, when the advantages of higher calorific power, reduced charges for handling, &amp;c., as proved by the adoption of oil in preference to coal on the railways of California, Mexico, and other countries, are taken into consideration. My Lords are of opinion that the opening of a commercial market in India would undoubtedly help the Company to extend its operations in Persia, and might conceivably result in an increase of the available supply of oil fuel for His Majesty’s Navy, especially in time of war or emergency. At present the requirements of oil fuel by His Majesty’s ships in eastern waters are not considerable, and from motives of economy the quantity of oil drawn under the contract with the Burma Oil Company for shipment to the United Kingdom, under normal conditions, does not exceed 10,000 tons per annum. The peace requirements of His Majesty’s ships in eastern waters are, nevertheless, expected gradually to expand to a moderate extent, while in war it is to be anticipated that there would be a considerable increase in the demands which the Admiralty would make upon the Burma and Persian oilfields. My Lords recognise that the expediency of adopting oil as a fuel in substitution for coal is a matter upon which the State Railways could best form a judgment, from the point of view of their own interests and on the score of relative efficiency, but inasmuch as the suggestion made by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company seems to present the possibility of mutual advantage to Indian and Admiralty interests, they would be glad if the Secretary of State would cause the representations of the Company to be forwarded to the Government of India for their consideration and remarks.

In reply to your letter, C.R 13,458, of the 26th March 1912 as to the supply of oil fuel for naval purposes by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Limited, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India in Council to forward, for confidential information, a copy of a note by Sir A. M.

Oil is novv replacing coal in locomotives wherever coal is dear and suitable oil cheap. For instance, it has ousted coal in Mexico for the Simple reason that that country does not produce coal and does produce oil which, with care m selection, is suited to locomotive use Ihe difference on the Mexican (Vera Cruz to City of Mexico) Railway (for which my firm act as Consulting Engineers) is put there Vt al om -0 pet cent, m favour of oil, and would no doubt be much more ’ if the Mexican oil fields were not a monopoly.

I suggest therefore that if these papers go to India they should be accompanied by a report on the Persian oil by one of the first authorities on the subject, and by an actual tender for it from the Oil Company. To show the low rate at which coal can be brought to the surface in India, I may state that the cost at the Collieries owned by the East Indian Railway Company rarely exceeds 3s. Ad. a ton including rent, sinking fund, and all other charges. The quality of the coal is fair but not equal to English. A. M. R. Enclosure No. 3. Admiralty to India Office. C.P. 23075. Admiralty, Sir, 8th November 1912. In reply to your letter of the 15th April, P.W. 558, I am com manded by My Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to transmit herewith, for the information of the Secretary of State for India in Council, the attached copies of correspondence between the Admiralty and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company on the subject of the use and probable suitability of Persian oil on the State Railways of Western India. I am also to attach a copy of the Admiralty specification for oil fuel which is at present under consideration with a view to the possible relaxation of certain of the tests laid down for flashpoint, viscosity, and sulphur contents. I am, &amp;c., The Under Secretary of State W. Graham Greene. for India. Annex 1. Anglo-Persian Oil Co., Ltd., Winchester House, Old Broad Street, E.C., Sir, 8th March 1912. With reference to the evidence given by the Chairman, Lord Strathcona, and myself at the recent Commission on oil fuel, I am directed by my Board to point out that it would materially facilitate the working of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, and consequently promote the development of oil fuel for Navy purposes by a purely British Company, if the Government of India were to adopt the use of oil fuel in substitution for coal on the State railways in Western India as we should thereby secure a certain market for oil fuel, and be encouraged to incur further capital outlay in the development of our extensive oil fields, and in the additions to our refineries which would be necessary to enable us to contract with the Admiralty for large supplies of such fuel. In my evidence I indicated that with our existing refineries we should be open to negotiate with the Admiralty for a contract for 50,000 to 75,000 tons per annum, and that this quantity could doubtless be largely increased were there any inducement. Unless, however, we can ensure a larger certain market for our products than is at present available to us no such inducement exists. The only direction, other than with the Admiralty, in which we can look for any large outlet for Persian oil, is with the Indian railways, because fuel oil cannot beremuneratively shipped from the Persian Gulf to markets west of the Suez Canal in competition with oil produced from the Russian and Roumanian oil fields. But, given an outlet for our oil, such as would he provided by the substitution by the Indian railways of oil fuel for coal, we should be able to largely extend our operations, and be in a position to contract with the Admiralty for much larger quantities of Navy fuel. It is perhaps superfluous to draw attention to the very great advantages which oil possesses over coal—as a fuel for railways as well as for marine purposes—as proved by its extensive adoption in California, Mexico, and other countries where it can be obtained at a moderate cost; and in the matter of cost Persian oil fuel will have no difficulty in competing with Indian coal on the Western Indian railways, which are now paying from Rs. 14 to Rs. IS per ton for their coal ex ship at Bombay and Karachi, to which has to be added, to compare it with oil, the much greater incidence of charges for unloading, handling, haulage, &amp;c., before it reaches the point where it is taken on the tenders for consumption. In view of the assurances of support given by our Government at the time the Company was formed, as explained in the evidence given by Lord Strathcona, and of the great advantage that would be gained by the Admiralty in thus opening up increased British sources of supply of fuel oil, my Board venture to suggest that you would draw the attention of the Indian Government to the desirability, on Imperial grounds, of giving their attention to this matter and of adopting fuel oil on State railways wherever it is found to compare advantageously with coal in ultimate cost and efficiency.

My Lords are given to understand that oil is not used as a fuel in lieu of coal or wood on the Burma railways, and I am to request that you will state whether it is claimed that the use of oil 0,11 the railways of Western India would afford advantages which have not been realised in the case of Burma. I am, &amp;c., The Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Ltd. Annex 4. Anglo-Persian Oil, Co., Ltd., Winchester House, Old Broad Street, E.C., Sir, 28th May 1912. I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. C.P. lo,258/8412 of the 25th ultimo, and in reply beg to inform you that it is our intention to produce two grades of fuel oil, one with a minimum flash point of 200° Fahr., and the other with a minimum flash point of 150° Fahr. r Ihe price of each will naturally be dependent upon whether the erection of the necessary tank storage at Bombay or Karachi is under taken by you and the State railways—and there are obvious advantages in favour of this course both from a naval and railway point of view—* or by us. In the former case we should for a substantial contract indicate a price of :— Rs. 35 per ton ex ship Bombay or Karachi for fuel oil, 200° F.P. Rs. 30 per ton ex ship Bombay or Karachi for fuel oil, 150° F.P. If, on the other hand, the tanks be built by this company to cover interest on cost of erection, rent, maintenance, &amp;c., the above figures would be increased by about Rs. 5 per ton for delivery ex tank, such figure being based on the assumption that, as the fuel oil would be required for State purposes it would be exempt from import duty. The figures quoted are quite approximate and without engagement, as I have no indication of the possible requirements for naval or railway purposes. I may add that we are quite prepared to contract for a term of years. At Abadan, our shipping port in the Persian Gulf, rre have, erected and in course of erection, tank storage accommodation for 80,000 tons, and this can easily be increased as circumstances may require. At present we are only arranging for tank storage at Bombay and Karachi to the extent of 2-3,000 tons at each place, but we shall, of course, be prepared to augment this to any extent that may be necessary to maintain a sufficiently large reserve to meet any contracts we may enter into with the Admiralty or the Indian railways. As requested I have asked Sir Boverton Redwood to report on the suitability of Persian oil as fuel, particularly with regard to the setting point at ordinary temperatures as determined by the presence of paraffin, and I am confident that he will be able to satisfy you on this point. W ith reference to your remarks anent the Burma railways I beg to explain that the production of fuel oil in Burma has never been large enough to permit of the Burmah Oil Company, Limited, offering it to the local railway companies in sufficient quantities to justify its adoption in lieu of coal. The position in Persia is different inasmuch as theoutlets available there for the refined products of petroleum are limited and consequently a considerable proportion of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s production will be marketed in the form of fuel oil if a sufficiently remunerative price can be obtained for it.

My Lords note that you have asked Sir Boverton Redwood to report upon the suitability of Persian oil as a fuel, and they assume that this report will be forwarded to the Admiralty in due course.

I hnd that owing to the presence in the crude oil of slightlv more than the Admiralty maximum of sulphur, as well as of solid hydro- caibons (paraffin), it has been necessary to devise a sneciel method nP '1“ “.if* !'f &gt;■«“--« si zS&amp;g ack mg to the oidmary cost ol manufacture of this product. Inachieving this object it was found essential to retain the paraffin in an amorphous condition, otherwise it would have been necessary to employ the costly process of mechanical separation of the crystalline paraffin. The solution of the problem has, therefore, involved a good deal of experimental work, but the final results have demonstrated that an oil fuel representing 50 per cent, of the crude oil and complying with the Admiralty specification can be made without the adoption of any special process for the extraction of paraffin, but the cost of this, owing to the small percentage of fuel oil obtained would be somewhat high. &amp; At the same time the experiments have shown that if the Admiralty limit of flash-point were reduced from 200° F. to, say 150° F., and the sulphur limit increased to about, or a little over, 1 per cent./it would be possible to obtain a larger percentage of oil fuel, up to 70 per cent, of the crude oil, at a lower cost.

His Majesty’s Government do not, however, surrender their right to be represente on the Board by a larger number of directors proportionate to their share m the Company, if such a step should become necessary at any future time. His Maiesty’s Government have given an assurance to the Company that this veto will be exercised with due regard to the financial and commercial interests yt the Company, and only in respect of matters of general policy, such as the supervision ot the activities of the Company as they may affect questions of foreign and military policy, any proposed sale of the undertaking or change of status of the Company, and new exploitation and other matters directly bearing on the fulfilment of current contracts for the Admiralty. 5 . The capital furnished by His Majesty’s Government will be issued in instalments as required, and is intended to provide for such development of resources and exten sion of facilities as may be necessary to secure an abundant quantity of oil for naval purposes over a term of upwards of twenty years. Ihe Company have furnished full particulars of all pertinent matters relating to their financial position and prospects as well as preliminary estimates of expenditure and a scheme of development. No provision is included in the Parliamentary Bill for the exercise of the option of redemption of debentures in 1920 referred to above, which will have to be submitted to Parliament if and when His Majesty’s Government decide to redeem the debentures. Purchases of oil for the Admiralty will continue to be a charge to naval votes. 6 . The report of Admiral Slade’s Commission indicates that, with judicious working and control, the Company’s Concession may be expected to produce abundant supplies of oil over a long period of years. The Concession is a very large one, with good indications of oil in many places other than those at present being worked, and existing wells have proved productive and of good durability. The Admiralty has for some years past kept touch with the development of exploitation in this region, and has had the advantage also of considering the evidence on this subject given before the Boyal Commission on Fuel and Engines, of which Admiral of the Fleet Lord Fisher of Kilverstone was Chairman. This evidence is confirmed by the investigations of Admiral Slade’s Commission. As shown in paragraph 35 of the report of the latter Commission, some of the Company’s wells have been “throttled down” to keep the production within the limits of current requirements and the capacity of the existing pipe-line, and it may be added that the policy adopted in the development of the field has been to drill the wells only to such depth as to prove the continuity of the oil- bearing formation without actually bringing them into production. The statistics of production up to September 1913 given in the report simply indicate the limited quantity of oil which has been allowed to flow from a few of the wells, and are in no sense a measure of what the Company’s output might be expected to amount to if the whole of the existing wells were brought into full productivity, still less of the possible maximum output when additional wells are drilled. Information has quite recently come to hand showing that one of the wells from which supplies have long been drawn has suddenly begun to spout with great violence, with the result that this well alone yields more oil than the present pipe-line is capable of transporting. It has, therefore, become necessary, in order to minimise the loss of oil, to undertake very considerable extension of the transport, storage, and refining facilities with the least possible delay. The favourable anticipation expressed by Admiral Slade’s Commission as to the aggregate resources of the Company’s Concession has thus already received considerable support.reasons which have bTe^ freqrentlv^xXh 116 ! 1 T ^ V Ubl ' C iuterests as confidential, for ever, that provision is madTtS ^ ^ be sta ted; how- scale of price'of a reasonable proportion oft ^ e y b °\ a ^ of the Admiralty on the present har t ^ stimated annual requirements allowance for expansion.

Experience in the use of oil fuel in sups o io arges size will be gained in due course when the five battleships of tne 1912-13 programme, which burn oil only, are commissioned. With the further engineering evelopment of internal combustion engines it may be expected a greater economy ln 01 consumption will be realised. Seeing, however, that at present most of le arger ue -consuming units of His Majesty’s fleet still use coal, and will continue o o 80 ui the immediate future, the latter fuel will continue to form the principal combustible m use in His Majesty’s navy for some time to come. Oil fuel is, however, o very great importance, and the proportion that the amount consumed bears to the otal quantity of ^ fuel used is an increasing one. Experiments are being carried out by numerous investigators to arrive at the most economical method of extracting oil from shale and coal. It is hoped, therefore, that when the use of oil in His Majesty’s ser\ ice shall be so extended that it will form the major part of the fuel used, instead of the mmor part as at present, the production and commercial utilisation of oil and other products of coal and shale will have reached such a position that the oil fuel so obtained will supplement natural petroleum to a greater extent than is at present the case. It would then be practicable to meet a portion of the increased demand from these sources. . IL The whole circumstances of the supply of oil fuel have been very carefully investigated by the Admiralty, with the valuable aid of the Koyal Commission. The situation has been considered from the point of view both of the amounts of natural petroleum that may be reasonably expected to be obtainable and of the possibility of the increased quantities that may be available from the sources referred to in paragraph 9. 11 . The quantity of oil fuel that is used by His Majesty’s navy is indeed only a small proportion of the world’s total production of petroleum oil, but it must be remembered that not all oil products are suitable for use in His Majesty’s ships, nor is there as a rule af any given moment any large quantity of suitable oil immediately available on the market, and what there is is liable, particularly at times of political stress, to large fluctuation of price. There is also the possibility of restriction of supply, whether natural or artificial, to be'guarded against, and therefore, in order to place the country m a position of security as regards the supply of oil fuel, it is necessary to provide that some considerable portion of the Admiralty’s annual requirements shall come from a source which shall be as free as possible from these disturbing influences. 12 . The policy of the Admiralty with regard to the provision of oil is to spread its contracts as much as possible over widely separated fields. Thus in time of war if some areas should be closed others will remain open. But while it is not desirable to draw all our supplies from one source, it is essential that the fields overwhich His Majesty’s Government will have -^1 £ ^ - developed times ot emergency they wi l be able to suppJy at short notice an^ae^^ ^ Admi ^ ltv is through failure of deliveries e sew ere. ajopted^with regard to other articles of prime only extending pohey whicy^been of . war&gt; and it is assuming such control that the State’can effectively ensure that supplies shall always be foXoming in times of emergency, and that the prices in such cases ^hall not be artificially inflated by interested producers and marketing agencies. It murt a^so be borne in mind that foreign navies are on the road to become large co J oil and that in the course of time they will be entering the market tor nc ® Quantities and competing still more keenly with His Majesty s Government for prompt supplies. This will probably have the effect of inflating prices or reducing available supplies, and for thfe reason alone it is necessary to make provision now to the present time the production and distribution of petroleum oil is fairly well distributed among a number of Companies. There is, however, an evident tendency or the oilfields of the world and the marketing of their products to fall more and more under the control of a comparatively few large concerns, do a great extent this is probably unavoidable. The policy of amalgamation is founded on considerations ot expediency similar to those which induce a large oil consumer to distribute orders as widely as possible, viz., greater security of supply, in order that a possible shortage in one direction may be counterbalanced by abundance elsewhere. 13. A large consumer like the Admiralty, with the national interest of naval defence in its keeping, cannot, however, place itself in a position of dependence for vital supplies upon a few large Companies whose interests are necessarily cosmopolitan and financial, although the Admiralty may properly place a reasonable portion of its contracts in the hands of such organisations, admittedly efficient, and possessing great resources. ^ It is important and essential in naval interests to secure that at least one large British Oil Company shall be maintained, having independent control of considerable supplies of natural petroleum, and bound to the Government by financial and contractual obliga tions. Such an arrangement can hardly fail to have its effect not merely on the supplies directly so obtained, but on the terms and conditions on which the whole of the Admiralty’s requirements will be met, owing to the greater independence and bargaining power thus obtained. 14. The principal conditions which have to be fulfilled in order to obtain a satis factory settlement of the fuel question are :— (a.) Oil of a quality suitable for use in His Majesty’s ships. (b.) Security of supply. (c.) Beduction of liability to great fluctuations in price, and economy in average cost. (d.) Economy in transport, and regular employment for tank-vessels. (e.) Economy in storage. The control over a large producing property which yields a quality of oil eminently suitable for use in His Majesty’s ships, and which when fully developed will supply a considerable proportion ot the requirements of the Admiralty goes far to satisfy (a) and (b). In addition a system has been adopted of placing forward contracts with reliable companies (including the Shale Oil Companies of Scotland) operating fields which are geographically widely separated. There will still remain a balance to be purchased according to the exigencies of the market, and in effecting such purchases all sources of supply will be kept in view. Supplies available from the United Kingdom and other parts of the British dominions will certainly receive due consideration. The realisation of (c) must follow from the fact that the Government will control a large portion of their regular supplies with the power of expansion in case of necessity. Similarly (d) and (e) will be greatly facilitated by the substitution of a regular source of supply under Government control for a system of contracts on the open market, which, in order to keep the average price within reasonable limits, entails buying large quantities when the market is favourable with the consequent heavy fluctuations in the demand for freight. It also reduces the necessity of maintaining more storage available than is^necessary for the regular reserve, so as to provide accommodation for a sudden increase in quantity, owing to larger purchases on a favourable market.7 stated^to SrHament onTh^7th C Julv^T*i3°that min&lt;1 ’ FIrSt ^ ° f the Admiralt y The Koval Commission ’ whil f f st a P^?P ortlon of ^ e natura l oil which we require.” dr- *' 6 ;ir z • + A 6 ' A 16 ^ rounds .°J l W P 1C P H 1S Majesty’s Government arrived at their decision to enter need Stoe'ct eT ^ ^ fnglo-Ve^n Oil Company are purely naval, viz., the tpera- l f ect 0n1 iA of a rea sonable proportion of the supply of oil fuel required for naval purposes. There are obviously other questions involved besides that of finance and the security of finding sufficient oil, and these questions have received due consideration. The opinion expressed in paragraph 11 of Admiral Slade’s report, viz as to the excellent effect in the matter of local tranquillity and progress already produced by the enterprise of the Anglo-Persian Company, confirms what had been earned from other sources, and it may be expected that an extension of the activities of the Coinpany will strengthen the effect already produced and indirectly aid in other branches ot local industrial development. # •n I 7 ' ! here is S round for confident anticipation that the step which has been taken wiil be of great benefit to the navy, and that the exercise of foresight in this matter, after the fullest investigation into the many complex questions that have arisen, will ultimately prove to have contributed greatly to the security of important naval supplies and to a very large economy of expenditure in providing for a fuel which will without doubt become an absolute necessity in order to secure the full efficiency of His Majesty’s naval service.

Ship y hich wiU falfil g iyen conditions of speed and doneTith cm! 1 It t dimensions, and consequently at smaller cost, than could be done with coal. _ But further than this, the great advantages which liquid fuel vlssefs of 1 vervb “b ^ ? roblem of , ou . r . naval design makes it possible to obtain ntb!v d' f ^ hl S bs P eed compared with the dimensions—a speed compared with thei dimensions which could never be attained if coal remained the only fuel. All tW C u vantages atten( ^nt upon the use of oil can be reaped by everv other nation that chooses to employ it, but, as I explained last March, there is one‘ great special advantage which oil confers upon the British Fleet which would not be enjoyed by any weaker naval power-—I mean the special advantage to the strongest navy of not hfmg forced to leave its fighting position in order to refuel. It may be assumed that the weaker navy will bide its opportunity in port, while the stronger must keep the seas continuously. Recoaling, therefore, imposes a continued strain on the stronger fleet without any corresponding deduction from the weaker. Oil which can be fed so easily from one vessel to another would, therefore, add an appreciable percentage o ie relative fighting^ strength of the British Navy, without any corresponding discounts m other directions. So much for the general advantages of oil fuel, which 1 think it will be admitted are considerable. The light-armoured cruisers simply could not be constructed on a coal-burning basis ; they would either have to be greatly increased in length and consequently in dispkcement, in which case they would become too expensive craft for the numbers and service required, or else they would lose from three to four knots in speed, and consequently be quite unfit for the tactical duties for which they were designed. Without the use of oil, and oil only, these excellent types would have been permanently denied us. Oil has been used for some time for the new flotillas of torpedo-boat destroyers. The increased speed of these vessels renders them, all ■ 6 nior o dependent upon its use. A coal-burning destroyer does not bear any o (12)22000 G- 80 1000 5/14 E &amp; S A 2comparison in speed or endurance wi&amp;an^ can s^relyldyan^teyondXi? present dimensions without merging into cruisers and becoming too expensive for the work they have to do. # • -i • 0 -l- • lippomin 0, so important that we must have the Our stake m oJ-bimung ^ tea( L su f o£ 0 iUt a steady price.

This second aspect of our ultimate policy involves the Admiralty being able to retort, refine, top—top means driving lighter products off by evaporation or distil crude oil of various kinds until it reaches the quality required for naval use. -This again leads us into having to dispose of the surplus products another great problem but 1 do not myself see any reason why we should shrink, if necessary, from entering this held of State enterprise. We are already making our own cordite, which is a most complex and difficult operation. We already keep our great system of the dockyards in full activity in order to provide a check on private constructors, and I see no reason, nor do my advisers, why we should shrink from making this further extension of the vast and various businesses of the Admiralty. r I he third aspect of the ultimate policy is that we must become the owners, or at any rate, the controllers at the source of at least a proportion of the supply of natural oil which we require. On all these lines we are advancing rapidly and we are moving towards that position of independence outside the oil market which it is our ultimate policy to secure, which we are quite strong enough with the power of this country to secure against any combination, and which must be secured before any fundamental change is made in the main coal-burning basis of the fleet. I come to the interim policy which is required for the building up of the oil-fuel reserves and for the period while the complicated, administrative, scientific, and financial questions involved in the ultimate policy are being settled. The interim policy consists in making at once a series of forward contracts for about five years, with a certain power of renewal, to secure a regular and an adequate supply during this immediately future period at reasonable and steady prices. It is the need of concluding promptly this series of forward contracts now being prepared which is the principal and immediate reason which leads me to open this subject so fully to the Committee to-day. I have one difficulty in presenting my case satis factorily to the Committee, and that is that this subject is highly confidential. These oil contracts are well within the ordinary competence of the Admiralty to settle subject to Treasury control. It has never been the practice of the Admiralty to publish the terms of its contracts or even the names of its contractors for important munitions of war, such as oil must be regarded. Parliament has always approved that course being followed, and it never was more necessary that this rule should be adopted and observed than in regard to oil contracts. When you are carrying through a series of complex and delicate negotiations which may power fully affect a market limited and controlled like the oil market, or when you are trying to hold a balance between various oil combinations, and preserve and develop independent sources of supply you do not exactly want to go and tell everybody what you are doing beforehand. Our power, such as it is, to make good and thrifty contracts for the public depends very largely on our being preserved by the House in11 our right of confidential negotiations. But quite amrt which though important, are not comparable In importance m ^ mm ® rcial masons, the subject, the quantities of oil needed for the fWt thi ' 6 A° tiie ot ^ er as P 0 cts of the amount consumed by various vesslds mnfei^rious c“ n^onTfi^ as secret in a military sense as the supply and reser^ nP n T ° 111 iese facts are cannot, therefore, attempt to discuss in public the detail -'h ^ Uaitl0n or tor P e(: loes. I give an exhaustive list of the contactin'? c ^ not conditions! 1 eaCb ’ ^ th6 dUratl011 ° f the C011traCt ’ 1^ 2 the^thTr I can, however, state the principle on which we are proceeding. The future of the oil market is so uncertain the subject is so specialised; and present prices tre so unfavourable, that a balance has to be struck on the one hand betweef tht reTatii t advantages and disadvantages of making forward contracts at fixed prices and of providing for rapid periodical revisions of price on the other hand. This has been kept carefully in view. In framing the tableau, if I may use such an expression o! the contracts which have now been prepared, three governing principles have teen observed : First, a wide geographical distribution, to guard against local failure of supplies and to avoid undue reliance on any particular source, so as to preserve as much security and as much expansive power or elasticity in regard to each source as possible ; secondly, to keep alive independent competitive sources of supply so as to safeguard the Admiralty irom becoming dependent on any single combination ; and, thirdly, to draw our oil supply, so far as possible, from sources under British control or British iiirlueiice, and along those sea or ocean routes which the Navy can most easily and most surely protect. Let the Committee observe that it is not a case of choosing oetween alternatives it is not a case of choosing this course against that On no one quality, on no one process, on no one country, on no one companv on no one ioute, and on no one oil field must we be dependent. Safety and certainty in oil he in variety, and in variety alone. (2) 2nd March 1914. In debate in Committee of the House of Commons on the Supplementary Navy Estimate for 1913-14. It was suggested last year that the policy which the Admiralty had followed during my tenure in regard to oil-burning ships was contrary to the recommendations of the Royal Commission. Both the series of reports and the minutes of evidence of that Commission, except perhaps the final report which I am now considering, are strictly confidential for military reasons, and also because the bulk of the evidence given was given on the distinct understanding that secrecy would be observed. I have, however, received from the chairman of the Commission, Lord Fisher, the following statement, which has been agreed upon unanimously by the whole Commission. That Commission, I must remind the Committee, contains some of the most distinguished men of this country, and certainly the highest authority that could be convened in this country, to consider questions connected with oil supplies. This is what Lord Fisher writes, and I will lay the document from which I take this extract on the table :— “ I have obtained the authority of my colleagues to write this memorandum in order that the following summary of the unanimous views of the Commis sioners may- be available for such use as you think fit to make of it. (1) The advantages to be derived from the use of oil fuel and the imperative necessity for such use if the Fleet is to be maintained in a condition of the highest attainable efficiency are conclusively established by the Commission’s first interim report. (2) The Commissioners are of opinion that the oil resources of the world are amply adequate to meet the requirements of the Fleet if suitable measures are taken to secure supplies. (3) Large reserves should he accumulated in this country, and with certain other storage centres on British territory, the extent of these reserves should hear a prescribed relation to the consumption under peace requirements, and this will give a definite basis.” In asking the House to approve the action of the Government in spending 500,000k on increasing the oil reserves of the moment—or, rather, ante-dating our accumulation of a certain standard of reserves—I think I can claim to prove that we have acted throughout on the highest expert authority ; that we have taken in good time all the A 3measures whicli are necessary to assure what is undoubtedly a very difficult and complex operation. fS') ]7th March 1914 In Committee of the House of Commons on the Navy Estimates V ; for 1914-15. The advantages of oil were very fully explained by me to the House towards the end of last session, but I have the authority of the Chairman of the Royal Commission on Fuel and Engines to state that the evidence taken by the Commissioners shows that the adoption of oil and oil engines will increase very greatly the advantages attaching to the use of oil as a substitute for coal in steam raising. I am dealing- now with the burning of oil under the boilers in the ordinary way, but, of course, the advantages are greater in the case of oil engines. The Chairman of the Royal Commission goes on to state the advantages. He says :— “ There is no doubt that, with otherwise similar warships, the one that burns only oil possesses a large excess of speed over that which burns only coal, and even exhibits superiority in this respect over that which burns coal and oil. The radius of action, when using oil in place of coal, is increased at least 40 per cent, for the same weight of fuel. The use of oil enables a fleet to re-fuel at sea with great facility. With coal this is impracticable, except under very favourable weather conditions. The special advantage to the British Fleet of not being forced to leave its fighting position in order to re-fuel need not be enlarged upon. The strength of the British Fleet is thereby increased by at least 25 per cent, (while not adding that percentage of strength to the enemy’s fleet), as so large a proportion of the coal-burning ships have to be absent re-fuelling. This also leads to a large unnecessary expenditure of fuel going to and returning from the coaling- base, and additional wear and tear of machinery. Oil bunkers can be replenished with great rapidity and without interfering with the fighting efficiency of the ship, and a few men suffice for the work. On the other hand the operation of coaling is lengthy and laborious, necessi tating the exertions of the whole of the crew; with the result that the men are physically exhausted by the operation and the ship is rendered for a time unfit to fight. The use of oil is also attended by the saving of the large amount of labour involved in coal-trimming and stoking, as well as in the removal of ashes, clinkers, and soot when coal is burned, and by a reduction in the stoke hold of some 55 per cent. Oil gives the great advantage, as compared with coal, of admitting a very lapid increase of steam production and of eliminating variations of steam pressure due to the necessity for the cleaning of coal-burning furnaces In a coal-burning ship, after part of the coal has been used, the ship cannot attain her full power without taking men from the guns to trim the coal whereas the oil is delivered to the furnaces with continuous facility until the whole has been consumed; moreover, oil can be stowed in some spare spaces m a ship from which it would be quite impracticable to bring coal to the U ruu CeS ’ W1 ^ ^ le certain ty further increasing radius of action. the use of oil fuel instead of coal makes it possible in every type of war vessel to produce a ship which will fulfil given conditions of speed, armament (kc., on lesser dimensions and at smaller cost. Further than this the m-eat advantages which liquid fuel presents m the problem of naval design make it possible to obtain vessels of very high speed in relation to their dimensions which would be wholly impracticable if coal were retained as the sole fuel ” Those are some pf the reasons which have been furnished to me by the Chairman of the Ruyal Commission, and which he informs me are assented to unanimously bv the whole of the Commission There is one other which I will add which has been brought into prominence by the manoeuvres this year. The great dangers to which ships of war will be subjected from submarines will not be in the open sea W when they are returning to their harbour for fuel. They may be waited for byTbmaThree Vhen coming m or going om of their harbour and suffer fatal injury The coal shins Wi have to go to fixed stations and to regular harbours to J coal, but oil-buS battleships, of which we have only five at present, will be able to fuel at sea in manv cases, and in other cases, to fuel behind any shelter without ever going to any fixedI point. Consequently, these vital units on whieh o,,,, 1 , been spent will enjoy comparative imnumitv from thlsT'f *'?* ° f ® 0ne y h ™» which all large vessels are being increasingly subjecte 'r !l and .^danger, to House that the light cruisers and the fast battleships of t L 1q% P ° mted ° Ut to tlle built with special reference to our war needs an,! t„ V 1 P ro Sramme were could not have built ships to answer the reauisite up 0f t -r re ? ul 1 ren ? ents &gt; and that we had not been prepared to take the step of Xtb “ fl if We 4 ad adhered to coal aad building up the oil reserve out of incoXXb? °X } '' lh , e . ln ™ ense b ^ d en of shoulders to bear that burden.

The Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Limited, was formed m l !)09 wi^thAe object D*^Xhtom Ae 28flrof MaydsoTand gives the exclusive UxUcy, wn cn iims y and carry away oil and petroleum products through- oifttheVersian Empire, except in the provinces of Azerbadjan Ghil^ Mazendiman \ i niiarl nnrl TCborassan The Company s capital consists of 1,000,000b 1 nlly laiu 0 d„b Shale?(dn issued) and 1,W0,W. Cumulative 6 per cent. Participating Prefereime Shares -Of which 900,000h have been issued to date It is empowered to create 0 Debenture Stock to the extent of half the Share Capital of the Company. At the present time 600,000b have been issued. 9 , The late Lord Strathcona was Chairman of the Company from its formation until his death and all the directors are British subjects. The Burmah Oil Company— which is’ entirely under British control—is largely interested m the Anglo-1 ersian Oil Company, holding, as it does, the great bulk of the Ordinary Shares, and for several years it has guaranteed the interest on the Prefeience Shaies. 4. Before the formation of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company preliminary exami nation and testing were necessary, and in order to carry out this work, and to comply with the terms of the Concession, a company known as the First Exploitation Company, Limited, was formed in 1903, with a capital of 600,000b of which 544,000b have been issued to date. The Concession provided for the allotment to the Persian Government of 20,000b Fully Paid Shares in this Company, as well as for a payment of 20,000/. in cash. 5. On the inception of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, in 1909, the actual holding of the First Exploitation Company was limited to one square mile in the Maidan-i- Naphtun field, which is situated in territory belonging to the Bakhtiari Khans. In accordance with the terms of a separate agreement, the latter receive 3 per cent, of the shares in any Company formed to work oil in their country, and in order to facilitate the working of the agreement, it was decided to introduce a second subsidiary Company, known as the Bakhtiari Oil Company (Limited), with a capital of 400,000b, to work the remainder of the oil bearing lands in the Bakhtiari country other than the square mile allotted to the First Exploitation Company. 6. All the shares in these two Companies not held in Persia are the property of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, the respective holdings being as follows :— First Exploitation Company :— £ Anglo-Persian Company - - 478,460 Persian Shareholders - - - 65,540 Bakhtiari Company;— Anglo-Persian Company - - 388,000 = 97 ‘ 00 Persian Shareholders - - - 12,000 — 3 ‘ 00 87 ’ 95 per cent. 12'05 .. 7. A royalty of 16 per cent, of the net yearly profits is payable to the Persian Government. 8. While the Subsidiary Companies are entirely under the control of the Anglo- Persian Oil Company, it will be seen that the Persian Government and the Bakhtiari tribes are considerably interested in their prosperity. This is an important factor both in ensuring amicable relations between the Company, the Government, and the tribes, and in protecting the Company’s undertakings from disturbance, a point of no little importance in view of their isolated positions in a somewhat disturbed country. 9. The Company’s Concession covers an area of some 500,000 square miles, and only a very small portion has so far been examined. Oil has been found in quantity at Maidan-i-Naphtun and has also been proved at Kasr-i-Shirin, whilst surface indications of petroleum have been observed at White Oil Springs, Kishm, Daliki, Ahmadi, Rudan, Kuh Champa, and numerous other places. The places mentioned are shown on the accompanying topographical map.25 Naphtun area, lyingmiles'^N.N.K orMo^mmera^ to be transported to the field by river and across adTfficolt trtT^l^t^eT skilled labour^ is S tnainly 1 recruited Wn&amp;whife fnffl : the accordance with a provision of the Concession Wo-aIv p ^ u P slvllled labo ^fers are, m been hitherto experienced in securing an adequate'surmlv Th’ alK n ° dlfficu ! t y has Khans lor the policing of the field works and ,mnev =Fi 7 ' P ^eements with the the Sheikh of Mohaminerah for the same work i^clSn Pfitth^Pefith wlte lower section of the pipeline, have been earn* pH mn u-l J f ^ ancl tIie Tl« material b«, elite obtained by ,he pe.mate m the (Im of 'r5i£°2tai2nt ZiS&amp;JSS: SrSiehSSt ““ -*-* * Previous Geological Examinations. 12. Part of the area held by the Company has been examined from time to time by several well-known geologists, including — 16 „ . Mr - ?\ T am Urls ’ F ' G ' 8 '’ Wh ° examined Kasr-i-Shirin, Ahwaz, and the White Oil bprmgs m 1901. Mr. W H. Dalton, F.G.S., late of His Majesty’s Geological Survey of Great Britain who examined the Kasr-i-Shirm, White Oil Springs, Shardin^and other districts m 190o. Mr.E H Cunningham Craig, B.A., late of His Majesty’s Geological Survey of Great Britain, and late Government Geologist of Trinidad, and Geologist to the burmah Oil Company, who surveyed the Maidan-i-Naphtun and Shardin 'areas in 1907. Mr. Basil F. Macrorie, F.G.S., Geologist to the Burmah Oil Company who examined the Maidan-i-Naphtun, Shardin, White Oil Springs, and Ahwaz areas in 1909. Mr. S. Lister James, F.G.S., late Geologist to the Burmah Oil Company, who examined Maidan-i-Naphtun, Ahwaz, and the White Oil Springs in 1913. 13. We had the advantage of reading the reports made by these gentlemen, who have all pronounced favourably as to the petroliferous possibilities of the territory. We were fortunate enough to find Mr. Lister James still at Maidan-i-Naphtun, and to have the opportunity of discussing with him the geological features of the district. Mr. James accompanied us during the remainder of our stay in Persia, and ids co-operation proved extremely valuable. 14. We have also perused a report by Sir Boverton Redwood, Bart., written in 1909, upon the oilfields of Persia, in which he summarises the data contained in the reports of Messrs. Burls, Dalton, and Cunningham Craig, and forms a very favourable opinion as to the value of the Concession. Geology of the Fields. 15. Elsewhere we have recorded at length the geological characteristics of the districts examined by us, and expressed our views thereon. Besides examining the producing field at Maidan-i-Naphtun, we also visited the following localities where petroliferous indications had been reported :— The White Oil Springs, 38 miles N.E. of Ahwaz. Ahwaz, 65 miles from Mohammerah. Hal-al-Naft, on Kishm Island. Lingeh. Sarzeh, near Sirik. The neighbourhood of Jask. 16. Our examination of the areas visited enables us to agree with the conclusion of Dr. Pilgrim/ 5 that the principal petroliferous zones occur in the Ears Series, representative of, if not coincident with, the Miocene of Europe, and in examining Memoir GeoJ. Survey of India, Vol. 34, Ft. 4, p. 36. 0 2matter of convenience, adopted these beds in the Maidan-i-Naphtnn held we have, as a Mr. lister James’s subdivision, viz. : — Upper Fars. Lower Fars: — Gypsiferous stage with a band of calcareous sandstone in the middle. Lower Limestone stage. 17 In the Maidan-i-Naphtun field the highest petroliferous zone occurs 1,000 feet above the base of the Upper Fars, and the lowest horizon tapped m the wells is about 1,000 feet below the top of the Lower Limestone stage, showing that a thickness exists of about 3,000 feet in which petroliferous beds may occur. The Tower Limestone Stage contains thick beds of a pecuhai (avernous 01 cellulai limestone, which appears to be detrital in origin. The total thickness of these beds has not been determined, as the base is not visible. The Gypsiferous Stage is represented by some 800 feet of soft beds of alternations of gypsums and red clays. The Passage Beds, of some 350 feet in thickness, are similar to the Upper Fars, but are distinguished by alternations of thin beds of gypsum. The Upper Fars are composed of sandstones and shales, the latter containing numerous veins of selenite. The thickness has been estimated to be about 6,000 feet. 18. It was possible to connect in a general way the rocks of other petroliferous areas with those of the Maidan-i-haphtun field, but no correlation was attempted other than to agree generally that they were of Fars age. Considerable lateral variation exists, and there is no doubt that a satisfactory correlation will be effected as soon as a survey is undertaken across the belt of country intervening between the isolated areas examined by us. Structure. 19. Flexures of considerable extent were observed in all the areas examined, revealing structures suitable for the conservation of petroleum. At the Maidan-i- Naphtun Field one large anticline appears to exist, although detailed mapping reveals that it has been puckered into several minor folds, the predominant direction being N.W. and S.E. The structure of this field is complicated, and as we have fully described it elsewhere, it is unnecessary to deal further with the subject here. We have, however, shown that a large area exists in which petroleum will in all probability be enclosed, and we have estimated this area to be approximately 3-|- square miles. As the Company’s production of crude oil is at present derived from only a small portion of the area, the importance of this estimate is at once apparent. 20. The structures observed at Ahwaz, White Oil Springs, and Kishm are all suitable for the storage of petroleum, but as no test lias yet been made, we are unable to suggest to what extent any of them may be productive. Test drilling is already in progress at the two first-named places. Actual Evidence of Petroleum. 21 . At Maidan-i-Naphtun there is one main oil horizon in the central field which has been proved at depths vaw dug from 1,200 to 1,300 feet. This hori zon is the one from which the production of the field has been principally obtained, and upon which reliance is now placed. 22. As already stated above, the oil is found in a hard, porous limestone. This fact is important, because under such conditions a steady production can be maintained, with very little necessity for cleaning out the wells. 23. At Maidan-i-Naphtun, apait from the successful borings which are producing at the present time, evidence of petroleum is obtained at the outcropping of an oilrock in the Naphtha Stream, where a black, sticky oil exudes at the rate of 10 to 12 barrels pei dav „ Other oil shows, though not so prolific, are to be seen m this area, where oil rises through the alluvial gravel.27 24. At the \\ lute Oil Springs two seepages occur on the crest of n fnlH r- i a colourless oil resembling kerosene is obtained ThO nmrl r 1 from which 20 gallons per day, and if nsed by the “ for d^ anticline is some 36 miles to the south-west, and although no evidence oJ petroleTm appears at the surface the same horizon as is exposed at the White Od S! • • expected to exist at some attainable depth below the surface. M ' f gs 18 25. At Kishm oil issues from the lowest exposed beds at two places about half a w •» 1 » 5 26. Several other instances of oil seepages have been reported, at which further “sTt 1 heTcalities eSlr time &amp;t ° Ur disp ° Sal did ^ble us to ; -l ft , V*„&gt;' 'Ihe Producing Field, Pipe Line, and Refinery. • • 27 L 0 ? ^ ^id^-i-^aphtun field 30 wells had been drilled np to the time of onr visit. Only 12, however, have been carried through to the oil horizon, and these have all produced oil, but some are wholly or partly shut down as their production is not at present required. 28. Substantial workshops, storehouses, and stables have been erected, as well as bungalows and houses for the staff and native labourers, of whom over 900 are employed. There is storage available on the field for 60,000 tons of crude oil, either in steel tanks or open reservoirs. 29. The oil is conveyed by pipe line to the refinery at Abadan, distant about 145 miles, and about 800 feet below the level of Maidan-i-Naphtun. The pumping station is situated at Tembi, 2-| miles from the field, where powerful modern pumping machinery has been installed. The pipe line is 6 inches in diameter as far as Wais (53 miles), and 8 inches thence to Abadan, and has an estimated capacity of about 1.000 tons per day, though this figure has been appreciably exceeded over short periods The greater size of the pipe line from Wais will enable considerable quantities of oil to be carried from the White Oil Springs and Ahwaz, if the borings there are successful, without reducing the quantity being carried from Maidan-i- Naphtun. The pipe line is provided with gate-valves 10 miles apart, and stations have been placed at intervals of 20 miles for the purpose of keeping an hourly record of the pressure, with a view to detecting and avoiding any loss by leakage. The line is patrolled from each of these stations, and there is telephonic communication between the field, the stations and the refinery at Abadan. About 75 men are required for the working of the pumping station and pipe line. 30. The refinery, which employs a large number of men, is of modern construction, well designed, and laid out Avith a view to future extensions. It contains four benches, consisting in all of 34 stills, and petrol, kerosene of two qualities, and oil fuel are produced. 31. To prepare an oil fuel suitable for Admiralty requirements it is only necessary to remove about 30 per cent, of the light products; allowing 5 per cent, for loss in refining, a quantity of oil fuel is obtainable equivalent to 65 per cent, of the original crude. A bench of 4 stills is capable of treating 7,500 tons of crude oil, giving an out put of about 4,800 tons of Admiralty fuel per month, and as the refinery is at present constructed, 20 stills could be turner! on for this purpose which would produce about 24.000 tons a month, or in round figures about 280,000 tons a year. 32/rhe total capacity of the pipe line is not sufficient, however, at present to deliver the necessary amount of crude oil, and the maximum possible output of oil fuel at the present time cannot be estimated at more than 20,000 tons a month, or about 240,000 tons a year. 33. The total storage at the refinery, completed or under construction, will have a capacity of nearly 140,000 tons, of which 60,000 tons will be for crude oil. A steel jetty has been built on the river bank near the refinery, having a depth of 25 feet of water alongside at low water spring tide, but tank steamers load to only 18 ft. 6 ins. at the pier, and take the remainder of their cargo from lighters below the bar of the Shatt-al-Arab. It is expected that it will eventually be possible for vessels to load to a considerably greater depth at the refinery. 0 3 * 128 The Output. 34.

VjVVlIli&gt; LU WJ-f JJIUUUUliUil OV-&gt; been necessary to keep some of the wells throttled down, and in none of them has the production been pushed to the stage of pumping. It is therefore, impossible at present to give any statistics which will show the rate at which the wells may be expected to fall off in productivity. 30. Although 10 wells, most of which are partly shut down, are at present producing about 900 tons per day, 800 tons of the total is contributed by three wells only. The wells which have been large producers are all within a somewhat restricted area in the central field, and it would be rash to expect these figures to be maintained throughout the area. It is, however, an important fact that hitherto all the wells have flowed for periods varying from four months to five-and-a-half years without any mechanical assistance, and without any cleaning from the time the oilrock was struck. 37. It is impossible, in the absence of more conclusive evidence, to frame any definite estimate as to the life of this field, but the evidence so far obtained points to an extensive life with an aggregate production much in excess of the present output. 38. The influence of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company has increased the general tranquillity of the district, but it would be wrong to assume that there null never be a relapse, and in the event of an outbreak of lawlessness amongst the tribes, the I situation would present certain difficulties which, though serious, should not be insurmountable. 39. In view of this contingency it is desirable that the development of the Company’s Concession should not be limited to one district, but should be distributed as much as possible consistent with economy of working. Conclusions and Hecommendations. 40. We are satisfied that the Company’s Concession is a most valuable one and, providing no unforeseen factor intervenes, the existing field is capable, with proper development, of supplying a large proportion of the requirements of the Admiralty for a considerable period, while the whole Concession, judiciously worked, would probably safeguard the fuel supply of His Majesty’s Navy,29 41. After an examination of certain districts in Persia adjacent to the Persian ^petroliferous reehms * an^thaTth P p' tS ° f th \ Co “ ce f offeJ reasonable projects as pctroMerous regions, and that the Company should be urged to test these localities without delay: Obvious advantages would accrue from the discovery of a productive field m the bout r, but we are none the less of opinion that even should these regions prove disappointing, ample supplies would be forthcoming from the northern ffelds provided proper steps are taken to prevent their undue depletion. 42 The Company cannot adequately develop this very extensive Concession without additional capital and we understand that the question of His Maiestv’s Government affording it financial support is under consideration. Should such a coarse be decided on, we are of opinion that it should be made a condition that Government should have a voice in the direction of the Company’s mmeral policy We would indeed strongly recommend that such a measure of control should be obtained as to ensure— 1. The efficient supervision of the expenditure of the new capital. 2. The proper conservation of the oilfields in order that the rate of output may he carefully proportioned to the resources of the fields, so that the delivery of oil under contiact to the Admiralty can be adequately safeguarded. 3. General supervision of the future development of the Concession. 43. In conclusion we desire specially to record our appreciation of the valuable services rendered by our Secretary, Mr. J. C.

Tt would seem 'hwi recent correspondence that this Is also f&gt;1r Fldward ftrsy’s view, end they note with much satisfaction the oonnsmioa* tions which it has been practicable to address to r is MaJeety*9 Ambassador at Constantinople In this matter.

The Admiralty on their side intend in letter above referred to, fully to justify the Admiralty T fnder Secretary of State for ^oeel fops inn office, w. for ^oeeim Affairsrs^pect of Admiralty contracts to rive as favourable consideration as practicable to tenders from the An^lo- Persian Oil Company, consistently with dne consideration of supplies from other available sonrees. ? 3. There wonld, however, be rreat objections to the proposal that the Admiralty should themselves embark, or recommend the Secretary of State for India in Connell to embark, upon a policy of finding £ 2 , 000,000 0 f capital for a Orltieh Company operating in territory which althou?^h presumably largely subject to British influence is nevertheless foreign territory. Although the promosri Is that such advance shall be repaid, it would depend upon the success of the Company both in finding its supplies and in maintaining its markets against powerful commercial rivals whether the money would be repaid and the Govern ment would be obliged to appoint x’epresen tat Ives to sit upon the Board of a commercial Company eng a ted in a business subject to much speculative risk. 4. My Lords have more than grave doubts whether such a policy could be #ecorr*ended to Pnrllament on nrvrd founds, and they think it will be clear to Sir Edvard Gres that to attach euoh far-reaching obligations to ordinary Admiralty contracts, mljpfit raise immediately or in the 1 future questions of foreign policy outside the province * of the Admiralty and possibly in certain eventualities 1., , Questions of military and naval protection in which the Indian Oovemment would be largely concerned. Tf such a policy eowld be advocated from the Admiralty point of view alone, which is not the case, there are other oil fields in which the aritnraents for similar action rai^ht prove to b~ eoiiel’y or even no re co cot especially if the fields7 .

In regard to Wr.^reenway’s rsnarVs as to the Admiralty being unwilling to plan* before the Secretary of State for India in Connoll a proposal for an Indian subsidy to -Mils Company to include a snb-oontract for Admiralty benefit, the present position is that the Admiralty are in oomnamication with the India Omee as to whether there is any prospect of Persian oil beln- •dopt®i by t,h« Indian OertrmsntRailways on Its marits of quality and price and the Admiralty have not yet received a definite reply. Mr.^reenvoy Is fully ovrre that cheap Indian ooaljvlll necessarily remain a forr^idabl? competitor with oil on some of the Indlan Railways and therefore If the Persian oil products cannot be adopted on their merits either for Indian Pailway purposes, or for other purposes for the benefit of the Indian consumer, the Admiralty in inviting the India Office to take up the question of subsidy would be practically asking for a subsidy from India to the Company indirectly for the benefit of Imperial Services. Moreover, the Company*® proposal in respect of India InyoIves proposals for prefer ential fiscal treatment of oil imported from Persia into India. This attitude in no way precludes the matter bein* put to the India Office by the An#?lo~Persian Company on its merita. 6* ?dy Lords note that the possible political aspect of the question from the foreign Office and India Office points of yiew has been the sublcct of a OMMttnlcation from the '’•orsiyn Office to the India Office,^ In respect of negotiations between the An.f3.o- Persian Company and the Shell Company, Mr. Creenway indicated if on Agreement were ultimately unavoidable eontraotff with the Admiralty on ordinary terrrjs mi^ht possibly be arranged with the An 3o-Pereian Company outside of any such arrangement. If that course were followed and if the Indian Government were also able on the merits of the coeetion to ntillae oil t*ml on certain of the Indian Railways where there mi^ht be an advantage in the use of oil over coal, considerable support would be nlven to the position of the Company on grounds that would not be of an exceptional character. If In addition continued diplomatle smpport Is ^iven to the Company In respect of the Mesopotamian concessions in order to avoid if possible the brin/dn:; of other Morei -n influence into the Persian fields, my Lords f* are of opinion that f apart fVom any political consideration which in the Judgment of 35r Ldward Grey or the Secretarv of State for India in Council midit Justify more excep tional measures, as much Governmental support as present circumstances admit would be i^iven to the preservation of the comierc ial ihdep end en co of the Anflo-Persian Company. C, My Lords have already expressed their general rerret at imy extension of influence which may tend to a greater monopoly in the oil fuel market by powerful combinations, but thoy have to consider from the purely Admiralty point of view in each case whether Admiralty interests would be so jeopardized as to necessitate the consideration of the lorre question of subsidizing com- (%y mercial Companies, -^policy which they ho,ve hitherto declined to entertain in other cases and which if once begunIn any further communica tion on this subject, please quote No. 53280/l2. 53280/12 and address — The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, London. O Foreign Office December 27th, 1912 Confidential and Immediate I am directed by Secretary Sir £. Grey to acknow ledge the receipt of your letter P.4743 of the 13th Instant regarding the future of the Anglo-Perslan Oil Company in -relation to the commercial and political position of this country In Persia and the Persian Gulf. Mr. Greenway, who represents that Company, called at this Department on the 20th Instant In relation to other business, and advantage was taken of his visit to obtain more precise Information respecting the points Indicated in your letter. He said that In the evidence he had recently given before the Committee now enquiring into the question of ' oil fuel supplies for the Navy he had indicated to some extent the position of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company; he might supplement that evidence by saying that the directors of the Burmah Oil Company (which he affirmed controlled the Anglo-Persian Oil Company) had been ap proached—approached in Glasgow by the Directors of the Shell Transport Company with a view to acquiring control of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company by the purchase of a majority of the ordinary shares. This, Mr. Greenway said, would be tantamount to absorption, which would mo over be more advantageous financially to his Company than an arrangement with the Shell Company either regulating the price of oil or transferring to that Company the oulk of the Anglo-^ersian Company's output. On being pressed Mr. Greenway admitted that such an arrangement might possibly be preliminary to actual absorption, but he was understood to say that provision for eventual absorption would be insisted upon in any arrangement made by the Shell Transport Company, and he added that it would therefore not be practicable for the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to undertake to give due notice to His Majesty's Government of an absorption.

With reference to the proposal contained in my \ \ ^ letter of the 11th October to the Admiralty and to the subsequent interviews in the same connection, ending with the Memorandum drawn up by Mr .Parker on the 19 th ultimo, I am desired by my Board to enquire if any de cision has yet been arrived at by His Majesty’s Govern ment in the matter, as the Company having now arrived at a producing stage are rapidly accumulating Stocks of Liquid Fuel and must necessarily make early arrange ments for the disposal of this portion of their pro ducts. It was suggested in the course of one of the inter views that His Majesty’s Government might see some ob jection to the proposed Contract on the grounds that it might involve some increased political obligations in the event of War or disturbances in Persia, and my Board he Under Secretary of State, f Foreign Office.| -*rv Board desire me to point out that with, or without, the proposed Contract, they would In such an. event ex pect protection, in view of the circumstances in which the Anglo Persian Oil Company came into existence. They also desire to draw attention to the fact that this obligation has already been recognised by Fis Majesty's Government in the provision of an Indian Military Guard about three years ago, when, at the beginning of our oporst/ions in Arabist/an, ths Eaklitriari tribes wsro causing us a good deal of trouble. But my Board further desire me to point out that the Anglo Persian Oil Company, instead of being a cause of trouble, has undoubtedly had a distinctly pacifying influence In that part of Persia where it is carrying on its operations, the large amount of profit which it has brought to the inhabitants having conduced to the peace and order which the Persian Government have in other parts of the country been vainly endeavouring to secure. Consequently, the extensions of the Company’s operations and the further large expenditure of capital which(m) which would be necessitated by the proposed Contract with the Admiralty, would, my Board consider, in no way tend to increase His Majesty* s Government * s political responsibilities in respect of this Company, but, on the other hand, would assist in a peaceful way in secur ing the restoration of order and good Government which is so much desired, as well as in the consolidation of British interests, in Southern Persia.

Green way has pointed out that from a purely financial point of view it would suit the Anglo-Persian Oil Company best to amalgamate with the Shell; but that the directors are prepared to sacrifice the interests of the shareholders to some extent, and to justify their action to them, if His Majesty’s Government will afford the annual payment and secure the concession in Mesopotamia.

The correctness of this view seems to be fully,, supported by the convention of which you have kindly sent me a C0 Py&gt; an d liom our knowledge of the actual circumstances. I may mention that the Deutsche Bank group has already on more than one occasion during the past few years indirectly invited Mr. D’Arcy’s co-operation in their syndicate, doubtless because they were aware of the weakness of their pretensions and knew that unless they could secure the withdrawal of the only serious competitor to tnemselves they would be quite unable to secure the concession. But for the reasons given m the early part of my letter he has always declined these overtures. In the circumstances Mr. D’Arcy therefore ventures to request that His Majesty’s Government will continue to give their fullest support to the negotiations which have, at considerable cost, been carried on by him for so many years past. His representative, Mr. Nicols, has not recently been in Constantinople, because he found it quite impracticable to make any progress with his negotiations owing to the chaotic state of Turkish political affairs, and to the determination of the Turkish Government not to deal in any way with the Mesopotamian oil concession until their policy with regard to the various railway-cum-mineral rights proposals had been fully considered and settled. If, however, there is now a reasonable prospect of the Turkish Government being disposed to grant the concession on reasonable terms, and the full support of His Majesty’s Government can still be relied upon, Mr. D’Arcy is quite ready to move again in the matter.

Copies of correspondence with the Admiralty requesting the supply of oil fuel for naval purposes have already been furnished to your Department.

Mr. Greenway said that a contract, in the ordinary acceptation of the word, was useless to the company ; what they wanted, in order to be able to raise the 2,000,0001 for capital expenditure, was a Government subsidy, or annual payment. He said this might be arranged in various manners :— 1. The most economical way would be for Government to guarantee the capital expenditure of 2,000,0001. in the same way that the Government of India guaranteed railways in India, i.e., Government would guarantee interest up to, say, 4 per cent., and be entitled, as a set-off against the price of the oil, to receive some proportion of the profits of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. This would involve the Government in a maximum annual expenditure of 80,000£. for a period of, say, thirtv to thirty-five years. 2. An annual subsidy of 100,000^., pure and simple, for a similar period. 3. An advance annual payment, on contract, of I00,00(E., the advantage of this proposal being that it would appear under the guise of a contract for the supply of oil fuel, and, as such, perhaps be more acceptable to Parliament than a subsidy pure and simple. In cases (2) and (3) it was suggested that the Government should be indemnified and repaid for the annual payments by a reduction of 5s. per ton from the price payable for the oil delivered. In other words, the Admiralty would pay a fixed price of 30s. per ton, less 5s., which would be deducted for purposes of repayment of the Government advance. ¥ Mr. Greenway suggested, as a possible expedient to overcome parliamentary objections, that it might be possible for the Government of India to enter into the proposed contract or guarantee : this they might do either as agents for His Majesty’s Government, or on their own behalf as contributors to the Imperial navy. Mr. Greenway said that he understood the Government of India were desirous of purchasing oil for Indian State railways, and this might possibly afford an opportunity, while contracting on their own behalf, for making arrangements with the Admiralty for such a portion of the oil contracted for as that department, according to its varying requirements, might desire. ^ ^ en as ^ e( ^ -^- r - Greenway to explain to me the precise bearing of the Mesopotamian oilfields question upon the position of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. .

I don’t think the point brought out in the enclosed memorandum was made clear in the notes prepared yesterday. I shall therefore be much obliged if you can add the memorandum as a P.S. to the notes—or attach it—as it is of great importance that it should be known that the members of our board who are advocating this arrangement are inspired by purely patriotic motives.

Mr. Greenway desires to point out that, in any case, the proposed contract with the, Admiralty and (or) Indian Government—together with the “ subsidy ” (or &lt;£ advance payment ” or guarantee) and partial protection from attack which would be secured by keeping the Mesopotamian oilfields in British hands — cannot be as remunerative to the Anglo-Persian Company as an alliance with the foreign combine, the object of which is to secure a world-wide monopoly. Looking at ^ the question purely from a commercial point of view, the directors therefore ought, in the interest of the shareholders, to accept the partnership offered by the Shell. But in view of the important national interests involved—economical as well as naval the board, whose patriotic motives cannot be doubted, are ready to conclude a contract on the terms proposed rather than sacrifice the British character of the company, and to justify their action to the shareholders hereafter.-p • -n Oil roniDany could not maintain its independence, even allowing for the Persian Oil Company co r inn 000/,. bv His Maiesty s Government. ersian Oil company o , f 100 000/. by His Majesty’s Government. suggested payment of an ’ expected from the Government In explanation of this, he said that tne proni xo p The -- In explanation 01 i » A nxrlo Persian Oil Company to stand up against the Xll Thnspo/Company if that company instituted a war of rates, as would without doubt be the ease if the Shell Company controlled the Mesopotamian oilfields.

In view of the attitude of the Lords Commission' ers, as explained in the second and third paragraphs of your letter, and in order to clear the ground before the meeting of the proposed interdepartmental committee. Sir E. Grey had entered Into informal and tentative communications with Sir H. Bablngton-Snith, as repre senting the National Bank of Turkey (which is under stood to be associated with the Shell Transport Com pany) and with Mr. Greenway, as representing the Anglo- Persien Oil Company. The Secretary These of the Admiralty■ A ^ s'* #» \ ^ w ;i!uch importance to the maintenance of the Persian ollfi. ld8 m the In these circumstances it is with some perplexity that Sir K. Grey has learnt of a communication made to this Department by ' i . Greenway, v/ho called here on the 13th. instant. fr. Greenway represented that he had recently Interviewed at the Admiralty Sir Francis Hopwood and the Director of Navy Contracts, and that these gentle men had been discouraging as to the prospects of the Lords Comissioners entering into a contract with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. He prefaced his account of what had passed at the interview by the following remarks:- Certain influential directors of the Anglo-Persian Oil company were inclined to come to terns with the Shell Transport Company, who were holding out substen- concern. tlal inducements and exercising considerable pressure toUHlfcBB bo, the realBt&amp;nce of certain director*, on Imperial In the fend break '’own. Mr. Greenway hlmaelf her been holding out the hope, which hitherto he her been en couraged to entertain, that the Lords Ccmlpsionere were deslroua of eeeing the independence of the Company rmintained and ware reedy to support them with that object. In this conviction he had sought an inter view with Sir Francis Kopwood, had laid all the facti before him and had. enquired whether the Lords Comls. si oners would be prepared to make a contract with the taglo-Persien Oil Coispany for a period of say twenty years. He had explained that the present resources of the Company would not enable them to supply a suffi cient quantity of fuel oil for Government purposes and in order to make this feasible the Anglo-Persian Oil Company would have to incur an expenditure of Two million pounds; this the Company was not preparec tc dc grounds, to entering the Shell Transport combine must(40516/lid) unlepp the Lores? Ccmroispionere wouie aftsiat them. t'reenway was? underetooh to state that he had informally proposed to Sir F. Hopwood. that the Mniralty should pay to ohe Company One hundred thousand pounds a year. receiving in return oil fuel on advantageous terns. The Director of Contracts, however, intimated that there wo\j.ld be parliamentary objections to a contract mch &amp;.f that propoae^, anr’ It was therefore FU^epted that the Government of India ml^ht enter into e con tract and allow the Admiralty to have an option on a certain quantity of the oil* 'ir F. Hopwood was not however prepared to make any such suggestion to the India Office and did not encourage T V. Greenway to hope that the proposal would he acceptable. o* eovei, v ir F. Hopv/ood is represented as stating that the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty must maintain full free- dora of action, and that it might be convenient if they were able to purchase oil at other places than in the Persian Gulf. ??r. Greenway thereupon said that if this were so then there could be no objection to the Angle- Persian Oil Company amalgamating forthwith with the Shell Transport(40516/12) Transport Company, though such a consmrrmtlon would appear to he In direct conflict with the views hitherto held by the Lords Commissioners, who had, ever since the Inception of the Company, let it be understood that they attached importance to its retaining its British character and itB complete independence. Itr. Greenway added that it wap true that, for the moment, there were tv/o or three independent Bourcea of supply, and amongst others mentioned the Mexican Fagle Company; hut he contended it was absolutely certain that their absorption was only a question of time, and that the Union Company had been amalgamated with the Shell Transport Company only a few days ago. He further stated that Sir Marcus Samuel, Chairman of the Shell Transport Company, confidently expected that fuel oil would reach three times its present price within a few years. This Department has of course not sufficient technical information at its disposal to discuss the economic side of the question, but they have hitherto proceeded on the assumption that the maintenance ofI (40516/12) tn.6 independence of the -Anglo-Persian Oil Conpany was eninentjiy deBirable In order to naintaln competition. If Mr. Oreenway *b Btatementa are correct Bir E. Orey in now in Borne doubt ae to what the precise views of the Lords Commissioners may be; he cannot overlook the possibility that the National Bank of Turkey, which will no doubt play an important part in the financial arrangements necessary in Turkey on the conclusion of peace, may, as a condition of a loan, attempt to secure a monopoly in the petroliferous districts of Mosul and Bagdad,- a consummation rhich mi^ht seriously affect the independence of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company since it would enable the Shell Transport Company to cut prices. Ha would therefore desire to be placed in poBBSBPion of the Admiralty view In e final ano order that definite recoranendations may he It Id bslore Ilia Majeaty'B Government without further deln./.(40516/12) I an accordingly to propose that.

GREENWAY. Enclosure in No. 1. Notes for Evidence to be given before Royal Commission. Potentialities on the Persian Oil-Fields. (Confidential.) THE concession held by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (Limited) covers the whole of Persia, with the exception of the four (or five) provinces bordering on the Caspian. It includes the range of mountains running for a distance of about 800 miles from the north-western frontier down to Bunder Abbas, in which there are many oil fields, the whole forming an oil territory of vast extent. It is unquestionably the most extensive and richest oil territory in any British or British-controlled country, and is possibly capable of as large an oil production as any field in the world. Therefore it should, in view of the importance of ensuring supplies of oil fuel for naval purposes, at all costs be maintained under British control. The opinion that I have expressed as to the extent and richness of the oil territory in Persia is based partly upon the opinions of geologists, partly upon the opinions of our field managers and drillers, partly upon information we have received from various European officials and travellers and from natives as to the existence of numerous oil springs, and partly upon my own observation. I must admit that knowledge we have gained of the oil-fields in Persia from the reports of our geologists is so far somewhat limited, because up till now they have only been able to explore a very small portion of the total area. But this knowledge, taken in conjunction with the confirmatory results obtained by our drilling operations and the reports we have received as to the existence in widely separated areas^ of numerous other oil springs similar to those on the fields where we are now operating, is, to my mind, sufficiently conclusive evddence of the correctness of my opinion, bearing in mind that the geological formation appears to be equally favourable throughout the who e range of mountains to which 1 have alluded. „ . As a layman, I of course express these views with a good deal of diffidence but, though I do not claim any geological knowledge, I can claim some knowledge of the conditions requisite for a productive oil-field as, apart fiom aving visi e se\era oil-fields personally, I have had occasion in the course of my business to read and study reports on nearly every oil-field in the world, including t ie many oi e t s 111 . e United States and in Russia, and those in Mexico, Trinidad, Venezuela, Peru, Galicia Hungary, Roumania, Java, Sumatra, Borneo, and Burmah, Persia, Mesopotamia, and [2662 x —10]2 wells in this maidan, all of which struck oil in &amp;a s ^*1?Z3%£2^Zffz£Z'% - there are two other maidans—one called Maida F • , s ; m ;i a r character, the other called Maidan-i-Bibian, on ^‘^Xndance.

The arguments used by them are :— 1. I hat if we compete with each other, rates will be reduced to a level that will be unprofitable to both companies, whereas, by giving the sale of our oil fuel into their hands, they will, by virtue of the monopoly which they will thus secure in the East, be able to dictate their own price to consumers. 2. That as they have a number of existing installations for the storage of fuel oil in Eastern ports, it would be a waste of money for us to duplicate these when they are are quite ready to undertake the marketing of our oil fuel, and to give us some share of the better prices that would result from the consequent absence of competition. These arguments are, of course, quite sound, and unless we can rely on strong support from the British Government w~e shall, in the interests of our shareholders^ have no alternative but to come to some arrangement with the Shell Combine. But as this would completely nullify the object for which the Anglo-Persian Oil Company was founded, and for which Lord Strathcona, Mr. D’Arcy, and the Burmah Oil Company (Limited) are associated with it, we do not desire to do this unless, in fulfilment of our duty to our shareholders, we are compelled to do so. In some proposals which I have recently put before the Admiralty and the Foreign Office there is a way out of this difficulty—the only one that occurs to me or to \ my colleagues—and if it is admitted that the preservation of the Persian oil-fields as a source of supply for the navy is an Imperial necessity—and regarding this there can scarcely be room for doubt—it is, I venture to say, the bounden duty of the Government to adopt some step such as that indicated in my proposals.4 Not only will this, hy preventing n '’'^p^h^^^obviate the ■■' ■; grave S*g^SC^JPStKrV. wind, ntherwire might,n.d prebahly would be, the case. , i nr li ca te what are the possible sources of In the above remarks I have omitted ii i countries.

OC . i l 12 j ^ i i^npr )i - ■ r ■ ■ J I am directed by Socretai’y Sir Edward Grey to transmit to you, herewith, to be laid before the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty copies of correspondence as marked in the margin respecting an arrangement ar rived at between the National Bank of Turkey, the Deutsche Bank and the Asiatic Petroleum Company for working petroleum deposits in any part of the Ottoman Empire in Europe and Asia. Sir H.B.Smith indicates that the new company pro pose to apply to the Porte for such a concession and he asks for the support of His Majesty^ Government if it should at any time become necessary. It should be explained that the Asiatic Petroleum Company are a market company of the Che 11 Company, which as Their Lordships are aware is a foreign controlled company and that although on the face of it. It would appear that the British character of the now Company is safeguarded e Secretary of the Admiralty.safeguarded by the laat^of^he-teservation to the Eng lish group of the appointment of the Chairman who will have a casting vote, it appears probable that the com pany will in reality be managed and controlled by the Asiatic Petroleum Company in view of the facilities at the disposal of the Shell Company^ organisation. Their Lordships are aware of the position occupied by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and of the support given for some years past to Mr. D'Arcy^ application for the concession of the Mesopotamian Oil wells. On learning therefore of the negotiations in pro gress between the National and Deutsche Banks I com municated with mr.Greenway of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company with the object of ascertaining ho.v these gotiations were viewed by that company and how it would affect their interests. It was thought that an tu-ial- gamation of the interests of the two enterprises might be feasible. A thorough discussion of the whole question has since taken place between me and Mr .Greenway an account of which Sir E.Grey desires me to place before the Board of Admiralty. Mr.r Ki/f oJrv^ ^ A o i C -, ; Q I zw) \i I Mr .Greenway informed me that 6ne”of the objects of uhe b'nell Company for years past has been to arrive at an amalgamation of Interests with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. The latter Company however largely on Imperial grounds have hitherto rejected all overtures made to them hy the former. Mr.Greenway mentioned that the Persian enterprise would never have been entered upon at all hut at the instance of the Admiralty who pressed the Burma Oil Company to undertake it on Imperial grounds. It was entirely for these reasons that Lord Strathcona em barked upon it. Mr.Greenway said that if the company promoted by 3ir H.Babington Smith succeeds in securing the Mesopota mian concession the Shell Company will have achieved its object and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company will be ob liged to come to terms as they would be unable to con tinue to compete witb a company drawing upon the whole of the oil supplies of the Ottoman Hnpire. in that case practically the whole oil supply of the world would be under the foreign control of the ShellShell Company an eventuality which Sir E.Grey thinks the Lords Commissioners might view with disfavour in view of the increasing importance of oil as fuel and of its possible adoption for naval purposes. I explained to Mr .Greenway in reply that the posi tion of the Foreign Office was a somewhat difficult one. The National Bank - a British enterprise,was ask ing for support to obtain a concession for a British Company which it would he hard to find good reasons for refusing In view of the attitude of impartiality always adopted hy this Department between rival British com- I asked whether some sort of local combination of interests could be arrived at whereby the two companie should retain their general independence. petitors. I suggested that the Anglo-Perslan Oil Company might racoive a ona ona half the share of the National Bank and allied British companies. mr.Greenway replied that such an arrangement would doIQ do If the Anglo-Persian Oil W * m o and con trolled the huoiness and if a Britiah appointed Chairman had the casting vote. I then enquired whether even in these circumstances &gt; competition would not he eliminated, between the Shell Company and the Anglo Persian Oil Company, and Mr. Greonway replied in the affirmative. If therefore. Sir E.Grey is right in supposing that it would be to the interest of this country that com petition should be maintained, it would be unwise zo encourage any proposals for amalgamation of interests between the companies. Should the Lords Coraulssloners he of tills opinion, then It will he necessary to explain the attitude of His fc-ajesty's Government to the National Bank and In timate the necessity under which His Majesty's Govern ment would find themselves of opposing the concession and of making every endeavour to secure it for the Anglo- ersian Oil Company. It is possihle that in these circumstances it . , to thQ National Bank that they should ight he suggested to tne ..ueiuix eliminateeliminate the Shell and substitute the Ariglo-Persian Oil Company. This proposal however is very unlikely to be acceptable to the Deutsche Bank as they would be most unlikely to consent to the renunciation of their rights in favour of what would be a British undertaking. In these circumstances, the only solution would be to sug gest to the National Bank that they should detach them selves from both the Deutsche Bank and Asiatic Petroleum Company and form a combination with the Anglo- Persian Oil Company. I This proposal would naturally not be so advantage ous to the National Bank as the present combination by which German competition is eliminated, but it might be suggested. It may be of interest to the Lords Commissioners to know mr.Greenway's opinion of the value of their Persian concession, although it is probable that the Commission which is understood to be considering the question of the adoption of Oil Fuel for the Navy is probably already in possession of the information. Mr. Greenway informed me that the oil fields stretch fromM J ' O' l the neighbourhood of Kasrl Shlrinlaa.^i^uth as Bunder Abbas, between the mountain range and the Persian Gulf and are oi greater extent than the American fields. If the whole of this supply is controlled by one Company - the Shell organisation - the wells would only be ex ploited gradually in order to maintain a high level of prices, v/hereas if the Anglo-Perslan Oil Company re mains independent, it would be to their interest to dovelope them. The position of these oil fields in the neutral sphere along the Persian Gulf might presumably bo cn important consideration in determining the future of the policy of this country in regard to Persia and in strengthening the determination of His majesty's Gov ernment to maintain their Naval supremacy in the Gulf. As it appears probable that Their Lordships have a considerable amount of information on the subject, sir E.Grey would be glad to receive their views at their earliest convenience if possible before the 19th in stant when he returns to London for two oays.

The prospect of foreign capital exploiting Mesopotamia’s oil resources was a particular cause for concern amongst senior officials in the Admiralty, who were dependent on APOC’s oil production for their fuel supplies, and the Foreign Office. The more peripheral interest of such a concession in Mesopotamia to the Government of India and the India Office is reflected in the volume’s papers.The volume’s principal correspondents are: the Secretary to the Admiralty (Sir William Graham Greene); Secretary at the Foreign Office (Sir Louis du Pan Mallet); Secretary of the Political Department at the India Office (Sir Arthur Hirtzel); Permanent Under-Secretary of State at the India Office (Sir Thomas William Holderness); the Managing Director of APOC (Charles Greenway).Subjects covered include:correspondence dated late 1912, chiefly between representatives of the Admiralty and Foreign Office, airing concerns over the implications of exploratory oil concessions agreed for Mesopotamia between a consortium including the National Bank of Turkey, Shell (referred to in the volume as either the Shell Transport Company or the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company) and Deutsche Bank, to APOC oil exploration in Persia;discussion of the Government of India’s interest in maintaining an independent APOC, and whether the Government of India should not invest in APOC, including a proposal that it purchase oil from APOC for use on the Indian railways, or contribute to the purchase of fuel supplies on behalf of the Royal Navy;through February 1913 to April 1913, diplomatic negotiations (including some correspondence in French) seeking to secure concessionary agreement for oil exploration in the Mesopotamian vilayets of Mosul and Baghdad for APOC (based on earlier arrangements made between the Ottoman Government and William Knox D’Arcy on APOC’s behalf) against the competing claims of the National Bank of Turkey consortium, and oil exploration rights outlined in the railway concession held by the Société du Chemin de Fer ottoman d’Anatolie (Anatolian Railway Company);between May 1913 and July 1913, with the likelihood of APOC not being given exclusive oil concessionary rights to Mesopotamia, negotiations to secure ‘absorption’ (with a British-controlling interest) of APOC with the National Bank of Turkey or its partners, Shell and Deutsche Bank.The core correspondence in the volume dates between September 1912 and September 1913. The earlier date indicated in the volume’s date range refers to a copy of a contract between Turkish Government’s Ministry of the Civil List and the Société du Chemin de Fer ottoman d’Anatolie, dated 17 July 1904 (ff 147-148).The volume includes a divider which gives the subject (Turkey in Asia: oil concessions) and part number (1), the year the subject file was opened (1912), and a list of correspondence references contained in that part by year.
