Much of the early papers cover the interdepartmental discussion between the India Office, Foreign Office, Board of Trade, Dominions Office, Colonial Office, Department of Overseas Trade, and the Government of India (Foreign and Political Department) over the need to address the question of British rights in Morocco and what similar surrenders might be extracted from the French in exchange. Memoranda on this subject are included (folios 289-303 and 305-312).The majority of the file deals with the drafting of a convention between the two powers to cover all related matters. Further correspondence with the Governments of the Commonwealth of Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, the Irish Free State, and Canada, as well as the British Merchants' Morocco Association, is included as part of this process. A copy of the convention, signed in July 1937, is contained in the file (folios 76-93), along with a number of drafts.The need for and drafting of a new Order in Council is also a matter covered by the papers. A copy of The Morocco (French Zone) Order in Council, 1937 is found on folios 7-8.Correspondence with the Postal Services Department of the General Post Office and the British Consulate General in Rabat regarding the closure of British Postal Agencies in Fez and Rabat is also included.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Board of Trade</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Dominions Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Colonial Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Department of Overseas Trade</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Foreign and Political Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000602.0x000371#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000602.0x000371#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
