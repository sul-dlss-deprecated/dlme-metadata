                           Tigris, to Porter. In the enclosure, Manners refers to Porter's letter, no. 83 of 1850. Manners states that he proceeded to Mohamerah [Khorramshahr] in search of the piratical boat referred to in Porter's letter, but found no boat of that description. Manners reports that he has been informed by the Sheihk [
                           sic] at Gram [Umm al-Qaywayn] that the boat belongs to the Sheihk at Katiffe [Al-Qaṭīf], to which port it has apparently returned. Manners states that he will proceed to Katiffe the following morning.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023711592.0x000007#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
