Also discussed is the definition of the term 'Fars and the Persian Gulf' in relation to customs duties, as this was one of the concessions that the 1903 loan was secured against.Further discussion surrounds loans and advances which the Persian Government were negotiating with the Russian Government; and a proposal for an irrigation scheme on the Karun River which was considered as a possible concession in return for a further loan advance.Included in the volume is a copy of the
