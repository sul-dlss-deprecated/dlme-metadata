M's Political Agent, Bahrain. J. svrz*. ^ /iSSS PEARL IHDUSTRY. GENERAL. For centuries the Persian Gulf has been famous for its pearls and at present the centre of the industry and the chief market of the Gulf is Bahrain. During recent years important Continental, Indian and Arab merchants, who used to send their Agents, have come themselves to Bahrain. The prosperity and almost the very existence of Bahrain depends upon the Pearl industry. Boat building and sail making, the only local trades of any importance, are closely connected with the pearl industry. The State revenue receives only a very small sum, directly, from the pearl industry, this being pearling boat taxes, but indirectly it depends upon the result of the pearling season. The imports especially those of luxuries, increase and decrease in proportion to the quality of the season. KUMBBRS EMPLOIED. Over 500 pearling craft are registered in Bahrain and about 15,000 menThe Pearl Industry Bahrain. Contd. -2- men from Bahrain work each year as divers, apart from large numbers of foreigners, from Oman, Persia and the Arab Coast. One of the disadvantages of the system is that it only provides employment during about half the year. During the off season the divers are idle and neither work nor can be made to work at any other occupation. 3. DIVING SEASOK. The season is divided into three divisions. it lasts, roughly, from the middle of May -until the middle of October. if the weather is calm and the sea not too ©ie cold the two short seasons are longer. The divisions are as follows.- i Khanchieh - about 20 - 25 days. ii Gho^s - the main season, 4 months and 10 days. iii Radda - about 20 - 25 days. Every year the Shaikh issues a proclamation announcing the dates of the beginning and the end ^of the GHOOS, ordering all divers to report to their Kakhudas ten days before the opening day Cr^ / n (ZHRLiS II R ftDT) HThe Pearl Industry Bahrain, Gontd. -3- (P^ day in order to prepare the boats for sea. Ho orders are issued as to EHANCHIEH and RUDDA and Ilakhudas may go out when they wish. The duration of the short seasons depends on the temperature of the water. 4. 3DIVIUG METHODS. The actual diving methods are simple. Mo mechanical apparatus is used, r' Some years ago a Persian attempted diving in a diver T s suit, there was a general outcry against this and it was forbidden by Shaikh Isa. A few days ago an application was received from the same man asking permission to use a diving suit.• It was refused. The pearl banks are free to every body. When the lakhuda has reached a likely position he anchors his boat and fixes the oars so that they extend above the water horizontally. A couple of eaes are tied i||to each oar, one with a weight upon it, on which the diver goes down, the other one by which he is pulled up, if diving in deep water. in shallow water the diver rises to the surface without assistance.Pearl Industry Bahrain, Contd, #4- The average depth is about feet. ?7hen the diver comes up to the surface he hands his shells to the puller and they are heaped on the deck. The divers work in relays diving almost continuously for about an hour at a time. Bach dive averages about a minute and a half. Every diver provides himself with a clip, like a clothes peg, which he fastens onto his nose, also hard leather finger guards which enable him to dislodge the shells from the rocks without damaging his hands. Round his neck he wfcssEs a string bag in which he puts his shells. The divers wear nothing but a loin cloth. The shells are opened every morning before the diving begins, and thrown back into the sea. The divers have a theory that by throwing the shells into the sea they provide food for the next years oysters. fphAy a] believej&amp;sl pearls have, aomething .&gt;to do withThe pearl industry, Bahrain, Contd. -5- with 4ir^p^~oi--raln~ , Ta*±±Tng''i-n'%~0'- : bfee-'--sea. The Uakhuda watches over the opening of the shells, collects any pearls and shuts them up in the sea chest. It is difficult for men to steal pearls because they wear practically no clothes and they have nowhere to hide them. 5. MEDICAL. Diving is an unhealthy profession and the o and the divers as a whole are not long lived. The boats are very over-crowded and sometimes they remain out at sea for two months at a time. The divers live on a ration of dates, rice and fish. Most divers suffer from ear trouble. Rupture of the ear-drum is almost universal, in fact men are not considered proficient until this has occurred. Euphysema of the lungs is common and is often followed by Bronchitis, acute and chronic. Yery often diving causes delation of the heart with valvular disease. Scurvy is often noticed during and after the season but Hakhudas appear to know the preventive value of lime ^uice and no boat leaves for the bankso The Pearl Industry Bahrain, Contd. -6- banks without a quantity of dried fresh limes. Quite a number of cases of fish bites occur, especially by a large fish, not a shark, which inflicts a straight cut like that of a sword. During the season the Government's hospital boat, a large well-eguipped boom, which was purchased four years ago, remains out at the banks and the Indian Sub Assistant Surgeon deals with cases of illness among the divers. Most of the Bahrain lakhudas seem to be particularly callous about the health of their divers. They do not ^ understand that temperorily^release a sick diver will be more profitable in the long run. There are quite a number of blind men among the divers. Blindness does not incapacitate them from diving. 6. DIVING SYSTEMS. Divers do not receive wages. They are supposed to share in the profits of the boats catch. They also receive advancesjrloans, from their »akhudas. Various systems are practised in Bahrain of which the most important are the following. y (1) SELAJIBH, or loan system. Is the most wni-The Pearl Industry Bahrain, Contd. tftmu J# ^ a 0**' i . t - s #r -'^ 4w most \iniversal. In this there are two methods, / Madyan and Amil . Madyan. (The Hakhuda of the boat is financed by the land merchant who lends money, at interest, for paying advances to the divers, equipping the boat and purchasing provisions for the season. The rate of interest has now been laid down; for the period of the off season fiu and 10^ during the GH©es. The same rate of interest which is charged by the merchant to the Hakhuda is charged by the Hakhuda to the divers and added to their debit account when they receive their advances. The Hakhuda is not bound to sell his pearls to the merchant who financed him. Amil . The Kakhuda borrows from a land merchant but instead of charging interest the merchant has , &amp; ZAA Uti: u'A.* tit ^ a right to purchase the pearls at not -mor^-^han SOjS less than the market value. Throughout the whole system it is the land merchants, the capitalists, who make the biggest profits. In reality they are partly money lenders but as money lending is forbidden by the QURAE some of them advance bags of rice instead of rupees.The Pearl Industry Bahrain, Contd They are practically certain of a very good interest on the money which they lend and they also compete in the buying and selling of pearls in the market* The biggest men in the pearl industry in Bahrain are the merchants who finance the boats. They buy pearls, cheaply, from their own Hakhudas and then sell at good profits. Only a very few of them started life as Wakhudas; most began as land merchants in a small way, or #V brokers, gradually acquiring funds with which to finance first one boat, and then another and in some eases as many as twenty or thirty boats. J&amp;uf ,4s these merchants do more of the big buying and selling and speculate more on the fluctuations of the market they stand more risk of disaster than the Uakhudas. Every merchant tries to sell his pearls locally during the season but most years one or two big men stick out too long for higher prices and have to follow the foreign buyers down to Bombay hoping to sell in India. (ii) ttftammas SYSTEM. This is a more profitable system for the divers and iB the system mostly used on the mainland. Ho land merchant enters into the transaction. The Eakhuda finances the boat.The Pearl Industry Contd* ^ - •9- Ho advances are made and proceeds are shared after each trip to the Banks. The uakhuda besides his ordinary share as a Uakhuda gets half of l/5th of the total profits.

Three advances are made by the Hakhudas to the divers during the year. SPti-frfc 1 u i# S1SU&amp;*At the beginning of the season. yrA The Pearl Industry Bahrain, Contd. -10- This is intended to provide for the divers families while men are diving and also to supply any necessaries which the divers may take out with them. b x*.ci KHARJIEH.

An advance made about six weeks after the end of the season intended to maintain the A i diver during the off season. Under the present rejime the amount of these advances is laid down by proclamation. If the conditions of the diving system were properly carried out, under normal circumstances, ' this last advance should be unnecessary. At the end of the season the divers should receive their earnings and these are generally sufficient to carry them on till the next season. If is dif ficult to estimate an average, but I think that during the last three years a diver's average earnings has been about Hs. E50/- to Rs. 300/-. Actually only a very few divers receive any earnings at all. During three years, dealing with hundreds of cases between divers, Nakhudas and merchants, I have not met half a dozen divers on the y-The Pearl Industry Bahrain, Contd. -11- SftMA p y * (pt H Aj on the Selafieh system, who received any earnings. Almost every Bahrain diver is in debt to his uakhuda, but three years ago the debts were even heavier than they are now, The better the diver, the greater the debt, not because he does not earn more, but because being a good worker, he has been lent more money in the past in order to put him into debt and bind him permanently to his Kakhuda. Since the Diving Reforms the Government has laid down the amount of advances which Nakhudas may make, but recently the Uakhudas have evolved a method of circumventing these orders. They lend money to divers whom they wish to retain, and do not enter it into their books. The diver signs a separate receipt and most of the divers believe that these side loans bind them to dive for their Uakhudas. If a Uakhuda claimed the right to keep a diver with him on account of a side loan the L Court would dis-regard the claim, but the divers do not realise this at present. ''Wo*' The following are the amounts of the advances since the reforms. Previously goodThe Pearl Industry Bahrain, Contd, % •IE- good divers were sometimes lent as much as is. 700/- for one adyance.

THE DIYIHGr REffORMSi IDhe diving reforms were instituted on the suggestion of the Political Agent, Major Daly, in 1924. The object was to give the divers fairer conditions and to help them to reduce their debts. Before the reforms the condition of the divers was that of slaves. Kakhudas used to lend tAfiy money to new divers so that^became hopelessly in debt and had to dive for the Uakhuda for the rest of their lives to wipe off the debt. Divers didThe Pearling Industry Bahrain, Contd. -13- % Divers did not even receive the full amounts which were debited against them as much of it consisted of heavy interest. Goods such as rice t totacco etc# were also charged against the divers at exhorbitant prices. Yery often they did not receive them. Ko proper accounts were kept so the men could never check the amounts which they were said to owe. Often when a diver died his sons were compelled to dive for the father's Nakhuda. THey also were lent money and soon became bound to the lakhuda, and so the system flourished. The greatest difficulty in attempting to improve conditions ajc^ the diver^ thsja&amp;eives. Tjjje-y are vey improvident and absolutely illiterate. Most of them do know how much they owe. As long as they receive advances and are young, they do not bother about the debts, but when they begin to feel incapable of diving they find them selves forced to dive because they owe money. Education will be the greatest protection for the divers against being swindled, but 'fefe© at theThe Pearl Industry Bahrain, Contd# -14- at the present rate of progress it will be many years before even avenpa small percentage of the divers can read and write. /If' .r'l r The beneficial results of the reforms will not be thoroughly evident for several years to come. The Reforms effected several improve- s ' ments, regular accoiints, a fixed rate of interest, ^ \ ' definite advances, and the abolition of the S fiL ft &amp; ^ ^ old Selafieh Court, a notoriously corrupt diving Court. When the Reforms were first instituted, | they were enforced with considerable vigour, but lately in my opinion, they are being allowed to slacken. Although H. E. Shaikh Hamad is mildly sympathetic towards the divers, he dislikes /v I countenancing any action which may possibly annoy any of the merchants or the Uakhudas. To enforce the Diving Rules it is sometimes necessary to punish persons who dis-obey them. H. E. Shaikh Hamad does not 4e support the courts in doing this. An important intention of the Reforms wasThe Pearling Industry Bahrain, Contd. -15- W) was that advances, especially the Teskam, should be gradually reduced. Ueither the Divers themselves . or the irakhudas like this so lately^ H. E. Shaikh Hamad has refrained from reducing them# A reduc tion was made in the Teskam last year, and resulted in a demonstration from the divers. Since then no reductions have been made. The Government | gets very little credit for the Diving Reforms; the Divers themselves do not appreciate the object of them, the lakhudas as a whole dislike I them, and many of the big merchants would prefer the old system of unlimited advances and interest and no proper accounts between divers and their lakhudas, 10. ACCOUNTS. Since the Reforms each lakhuda has to keep two accounts. J? i. General account^ showing, on credit side the receipts from sale of pearls and on the deb^jfc side the nature and amount of exe&amp;y expenditure any part of which falls on the crew. ii» An account book showing each diver's particular account on a separate page. Each diver has a small account book inThe Pearl Industry, Bahrain, Contd -16- m in which the lakhuda enters that diver's particular account, showing the balance after each season. This book corresponds to the Kakhuda's Ho. E account but is kept in the possession of the diver himself. A number of official diving clerks, appointed the Government, are authorised to make up diving i accounts. They have offices in Manama and in Maharrak and are allowed to charge a small fixed rate for making up accounts. 11. THE MARKET. Most of the important buying and selling is done on shore. The biggest buyers are the Continental merchants, ^ Rosenthal and Pack, Mohomedali Zainal and his partner Bienenfield, and one or two Indian and Persian merchants. They usually arrive just after the opening of the main season and leave a week or two after it closes. The^ pearls are polished and graded in Bombay and then taken to Paris and London for sale to English and American buyers. If more big buyers came from Europe local prices would be higher and Bahrain would profit et + &gt;,0 o -y -p ii r of liln jji -'ivl Imyirn puhl i n nf ^nrnpr and Am^rina. possibly easier communication betweenPearl Industry Bahrain, Contd. -17- between Europe and the East, especially by Air, and improved living conditions in Bahrain will induce more buyers to come here in the future. lone of the buyers pay cash down. Some- •- times payments are not completed until the following season but usually half is paid on purchase and the rest three or four months later. IE. BROKERS. Much of the actual buying and selling is done by brokers who carry pearls from merchant to merchant offering them for sale. Brokers get commission from the buyer, or occasionally, by special arrangement, from both parties. When the prospective buyer has made a definite offer three chits are written describing the weight of the pearls and amount offered. The bidder keeps one chit, the broker takes/the other one'and the third is placed with the pearls which are sealed up by the broker and left with the buyer until the owner decides whether he will sell or not. It is remarkable that though there is ample opportunity for theft and cheating by brokers very few cases of this sort actually occur.The Pearl Industry Bahrain, Gontd. -18- Often men who are literally bankrupt carry round pearls that are worth lacs of rupees. Pearl brokers are not licensed and do not have to deposit 'TRlA/ftsrt#// a security as is the rule with bazar brokers. 13. (DAWASM.

Other prospective buyers have , Lut. to te off till the deal is finished. 14. MOTOH LAUNCHES. During recent years the number of motor launches in Bahrain has much increased. ■Ihey consist of locally built boats with motor engines. - At the beginning of the last pearling season half a dozen of the big land merchants announced that they were going out to the banks in launches to buy pearls. There was general indignation against this 4-I in the pearling community and a petition was(Che Pearling Industry Bahrain, Contd. — -19- was presented to the Shaikh, signed by all the leading men, protesting against the use of motor / 1 launches. Shaikh Hamad was inclined to dis- ' | regard the petition but eventually he forbade t&amp;ftm tor the time being# The question has not yet been w decided definitely. There is a difference of | t opinion on the subject among the mainland Shaikhs some favouring the use of launches, others opposing it. 15. CUITU1ED PEARLS. THE increasing number of cultured pearls which find their way into the pearl market is said to be having a bad effect on pearl trade in general. These pearls, which are worth about l/3rd the value of a real pearl, cannot be dis- &gt; tinguished, even by an expert, without an elaborate ''Mr electrically worked apparatus. last season several cultured pearls were detected in Bahrain. Mr. Bienenfield, the partner of Mohamed Ali Zainal, brought out with him the apparatus for testing pearls. In cases of bored pearls it is considered mfalliable but in the case of unbored pearls it leaves a slight margin of doubt. a needle contain-■The Pearl Industry Bahrain, Contd. -20- containing in itself two minute mirrors, is introduced into the pearl itself and by means of powerful electric light the inside of the pearl is so illuminated that one can see whether the heart of the pearl is natural or not. The Bahrain Government has forbidden the import of cultured as well as artificial pearls but in the former case it is impossible for the Customs officers to detect them. it was suggested that the Government should purchase one of the testing machines and charge a f^e to the users. y Z'i- 1*9 I a.

Gfl.REPORT ON THE TRAJQE OP THE BilRAIN ISLANDS PGR THS YEAR ENDING 31st M&amp;ROH 1929. INTRODUCTION . i general description of the physical, political and commercial peculiarities of the islands is given in the report for the year 1911-12 (Annual Series No,5052). The permanent population is estimated at 115,000. TRADE. The total value of the trade amounted to £ 3,110,341 compared with £ 3043,222 in 1927-28 showing an increase of £ 67,119 or 2.2 per cent. The total value of Imports amounted to £ 2,116,616 as against £ 2,029,181 in 1927-28 showing an increase of £ 87,435 or 4.3 per cent. The increase was chiefly in piece- goods, tea, coffee, tohacco, spices and 'building materials. It is interesting to note that while there was a decrease 1 in the import of piece goods last year, it shows an increase of £ 42,543 during the year under report. It will 'be seen that cotton goods valued at £ 238,140 are shown as imported from India. This is misleading as the bulk of the 08X9-0inroorted from the United Kingdom arrives via India this and consequently appears under pis heading. PPiARL INDUSTRY . A general description of this Industry is given in this Agency Trade Report for the year 1927-^8. EXPORTS . The total value of Exports during the year amounted to ; £ 993,725 as against £ 1,014,041 in 1927-28 showing a decrease of £ 20,316 or 2 per cent. The pearl trade dominated the commercial situation.

CUSTOMS. The tariff is fixed by treaty at 5 per cent advalorem on all imports. In June 1920 on the advice of the Govemm en t of India the tax on goods landed at Bahrain in transit for the mainland was reduced to 2 per cent, from 5 per cent at ushich it formerly stood. Export duty of Rs. 10 per bundle of hides andPage 3, and Rs.2 per basket of dates is charged. The Oustoms work is carried on hy an European Director of Gustoms under the orders of the Ruler of Bahrain. MQ.UIRIES REGARDING- TRADE . The Political Agent, Bahrain, who is in close touch with the local and mainland affairs, will be glad to answer any enquiries regarding trade from merchants in the United Kingdom through the Commercial Intelligence Branch of the Board of Trade. Enquiries from India should be made through the Director General of Commercial Intelligence at Calcutta. Time would probably be saved by addressing the latter official direct, as information on most ordinary matters is available in his records. SHIPPING, There is a regular weekly mail service from India and bi-weekly to India. As reported previously owing to the abolition of the British Post Office at Bushire,, the practice of sending mails to India by up-steamers via Bushire has ceased. Thus the number of mails to India reduced from 6 to 2« This somewhat adversely affects the commercial community, GENERAL REMARKS , Motor roads suitable for cars and lorries exist over the greater part of the islands. There are about 200 motor cars of various makes and motor cars are xai available on hire. Mot or boats ply regularly between Bahrain and Qatar on the mainland and also run between Bajirain and Qatif and Ojair. * i Political Agent,Bahrain.

Introduction. The independent Arab Principality of Bahrain consists of a group of islands off the East Coast of Arabia. The State is under British protection but is not a protectorate. A general description of the physical, political and commercial peculiarities of the Islands is given in the Report for the year 1911-12 (Annual Series No. 5052), The permanent population is estimated at 115,000. Trade. The total value of the trade amounted to £2,818,257 as compared with £3,110,341 in 1928-29, showing a decrease of £292,084 or 9*4 per cent. The total value of Imports amounted to £1,930,692 as against £2,116,616 in 1928-29, showing a decrease of £185,924 or 8*8 per cent. The decrease is chiefly due to the rebellion in Nejd and to the commence ment of the slump in the Pearl trade. It will be seen that Cotton goods valued at £185,734 are shown as imported ftom India. This is misleading as the bulk of the cargo imported from the United Kingdom arrives via India and conse quently appears under this heading, and also a large quantity of Japanese piecegoods. Pearl Industry, A general description of this Industry is given in this Agency Trade Report for the year 1927-28. Exports.

Customs. The Tariff is fixed by Treaty at 5 per cent, ad valorem on all imports. In June 1920 on the ad vice of the Government of India the tax on goods landed at Bahrain in transit for the mainland was reduced to 2 per cent, from 5 per cent, at which it formerly stood. Export duty of Rs. 10 per bundle of hides and Rs. 2 per basket of dates is charged. The Customs work is carried on by a European Director of Customs under the orders of the Ruler of Bahrain. Agriculture. On its northern shores Bahrain is blessed with an abundant water supply from springs and more recently from artesian wells. An Agricultural ex pert has been engaged and it is hoped that with increasing knowledge better use will be made of the wide area of fertile soil available. As recently as 150 years ago Bahrain was famous for its cotton which was exported as far afield as Baghdad, and there is no reason why these days should not return. So far no market for fertilisers or agricultural instru ments can be said to exist, and animal manures only are employed. Banks. A branch of the Eastern Bank exists at Bahrain and transacts all classes of business, and the hundi system is also used by the Hindu merchants. This bank is also the State Bank of the Bahrain Government.Enquiries Regarding Trade. The Political Agent, Bahrain, who is in close touch with local and mainland affairs, will be glad to answer any enquiries regarding trade from mer chants in the United Kingdom through the Commer cial Intelligence Branch of the Board of Trade. Enquiries from India should be made through the Director General of Commercial Intelligence at Calcutta. Time would probably be saved by address ing the latter official direct, as information on most ordinary matters is available in his records. Shipping. There is a regular weekly mail service from India and bi-weekly to India. As reported previously owing to the abolition of the British Post Office at Bushire the practice of sending mails to India by up-steamers via Bushire has ceased. Thus the number of mails to India are reduced from six to two. This adversely affects the commercial com munity. General Remarks. Motor roads suitable for cars and lorries exist ove» the greater part of the Islands. There are about 200 motor cars of various makes and motor cars are available on hire. Motor boats ply regularly bet ween Bahrain and Qatar on the mainland and also between Bahrain and Qatif and Ojair. C. G. PRIOK, Political Agent, BahrainC's. P. P.—L (in) 980—300-1-30—f.

Introduction. The Independent Arab Principality of Bahrain consists of a group of islands off the East coast of Arabia. The State is under British protection but is not a protectorate. A general description of the physical, political and commercial peculiarities of the Islands is given in the Report for the year 1911-12 (Annual Series No. 5052). The permanent population is estimatea at 115,000. Trade. The total value of the trade amounted to £1,691,558 as compared with £2,818,257 in 1929-30, showing a decrease of £1,126,699 or 39-9 per cent. The total value of Imports amounted to £1,087,524 as against £1,930,692 in 1929-30, showing a decrease of £843168 or 43-7 per cent. The decrease chiefly due to the worldwide fall m pnces of com modities but owing to the tightness of ready money anrl flip slunrD in the pearl trade actual imports have decreased and the market for better class goods is at a stand-still. Since pearls are a luxury, and are only boug when other wants have been satisfied, the depres sion has been felt acutely in Bahrain which is almost entirely dependent on the pearl trade for a ll will be seen that Cotton goods valued at £79^38 are shown as imported from India. This ™ leading as the bulk of the car ^° ^ and consT- the United Kingdom arrives via India and conse pertly h f di„g. .nd .Is. a quantity of Japanese piecegoods. Pearl Industry.

A great deal of labour is involved in altering rupees to sterling and,moreover since the sterling fluctuates or the rupee does,whichever my you care to look at it 5 the figures are necessarily given at a fixed rate of exchange which has little value at arriving at the exact amount of any particular import. Since this Agency is supported entirely by the Crovem ent of India there seems to be no reason why we should publish these statistics in any other currency than that which they themselves employ, and i would be glad to know if there is any objection to our expressing these statistics in rupees in future since they are the figures which are supplied by the Director of Customs, Bahrain. lours Sincerely, cu G ap t a in •. 11. • »as trell.

Copies of the report have been despatched to the Foreign Office, London, and to the Hon'ble the Political Eesident at Bushire. V IM-Trade Report of the Bahrain Islands for the year ended the 31st March 1932. Introduction. —The Independent Arab Principality of Bahrain consists of a group of islands off the East coast of Arabia. The State is under British protection but is not a protectorate. A general description of the physical, political and commercial peculiarities of the Islands is given in the Eeport for the year 1911-1912 (Annual Series No. 5052). The permanent population is estimated at 115,000. Trade. —The total value of trade for the year amounted to £1,369,720 as compared with £1,691,558 in 1930-31, showing a decrease of £321,838 or 19*02 per cent. This decrease is chiefly due to the world wide fall in prices of commodities and to the lack of ready money, due to the slump in the pearl trade ; actual imports have decreased and the market for better class goods is at a standstill. Further, since pearls are a luxury and are only bought when other wants have been satisfied the depression is being more acutely felt in Bahrain than elsewhere, since it is almost entirely dependent on the pearl trade for a living. Imports. —The total value of Imports amounted to £821,824 as against £1,087,524 in 1930-31, showing a decrease of £265,700 or 24-43 per cent.

A considerable quantity of the textiles shown as imported from India are actually of Japanese origin and this point must be borne in mind. British imports benefited from the departure from the gold standard, but Japan s departure from the gold standard to all intents and purposes neutralized this advantage. Exports. —The total yalue of Exports amounted to £547,896 as against £604,034 in 1930-31, showing a decrease of £56,138 or 10-24 per cent. The follow ing table shows the movements of general merchan dise as compared with pearls, specie and gold coins. 1930-31. 1931-32. Per cent of increase or decrease. Pearls .... Specie and Dollars .

This activity in the export of gold is chiefly due to its rise in value consequent on the abandonment of the gold standard by Great Britain and India. The gold comprised not only coins but ornaments of all kinds and the opportunity was taken to dispose at a profit of the hoardings of years. Since many pearls leaving Bahrain are not declared and very few declared at their correct value, it is impossible to give exact figures for their export but the amount is variously estimated at between one-and-a-half and 2 million pounds in a good year. Last year the value fell far short of this amount. Pearl Industry. —A general description of this industry is given in this Agency Trade Eeport for the year 1927-28. Customs. —The Tarif£ is fixed by Treaty at 5 per cent ad valorem on all imports. In June 1920 on the advice of the Government of India the tax on goods landed at Bahrain in transit to the mainland was reduced from 5 per cent to 2 per cent at which figure it formerly stood. Export duty of Es. 10 per bundle of hides and Es. 2 per basket of dates is charged. The Customs work is carried on by a European Director of Customs under the orders of the Euler of Bahrain. Banks. —A branch of the Eastern Bank exists at Bahrain and transacts all classes of business and the Hundi system is also used by the Hindu mer chants. This bank is also the State bank of the Bahrain Government. Oils and Minerals.—The Bahrain Petroleum Com pany Limited, a subsidiary company of the Standard Oil Company Limited of California has been prospec ting for oil in Bahrain. They have put down a test bore and though traces of gas have been met no oil has hitherto been discovered in commercial quantities. Enquiries regarding trade. —The political Agent, Bahrain, who is in close touch with local and main land affairs, will be glad to answer any enquiries regarding trade from merchants in the United Kingdom through the Board of Overseas Trade. Enquiries from India should be made through the Director General of Commercial Intelligence at Calcutta. Time would probably be saved by ad dressing the latter official direct, as information on most ordinary matters is available in his records. Shipping. —There is now a regular weekly mail service from and to India and 'IEAQ. General Motor roads suitable for cars and lorries exist over the greater part of the Islands. There are about 200 motor cars of various makes and motor cars are available for hire. Motor boats ply regularly between Bahrain and Qatar on the mainland and also between Bahrain and Qatif and Ojair, and occasionally to Kuwait and Dubai. C. G.
