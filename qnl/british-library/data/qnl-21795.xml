The only practicable alternative » subject to your views and those of His Majesty’s Minister, would seem to be an arrangement by which applications for Navicerts should be dealt with by political Agent, Bahrein The main drawback would be impossibility of superintending loading of cargo in order to ensure thet only approved cargo is shipped* Please let me have your views* RETAX ANDUMCONFIDENTIAL.

As regards Bahrain itself we are already issuing Export Licenses for oil products. The figures entered in these licenses are not checked by this Agency but are accepted on the v/ord of the Oil Company. 3. The extension of the system to other articles of trade will mean a large increase in applications from exporters and an increased number of references to London. This work will be dealt with in this Agency and will require the service of an extra upper division clerk. 4. As regards the checking of Export Licences with exports at the quayside, I have discussed the matter with the Director of Customs, Bahrain, wno already, through his tally clerks, checks all out-going cargo, whether by steamer or native craft, against shipping bills. He anticipates no difficulty in seeing that no unauthorised articles are exported and will, as far as can be seen, require no extra staff. 5. As regards exports from Dubai and Sharjah, the Political /- I v i'l mm - 2 - Political Officer, Trucial Coast and the Residency Agent have only got one munshi, and a lower grade clerk will be required cope with the extra work.

(82) dated the 31st July 1940 from the Government of India Department of Comnerce to the Collector of Customs, Bombay etc., In order t o tighten Contraband Control on Europe it has been decided that ships leaving their last overseas port of call for Continental Europe will be liable to sezure if their voyages have not been specifically approved by issue of a ship Navicert. It is unlikely that ship Navicerts will have to be issued in Indii. because presumably ships will always call at intermediate ports before reaching Europe. But in order to assist officers at the last of such ports, it has been decided that cormencing from the 10th August, you should arrange to give the ilaster or e*ch ship bound Tor any port in Continental Europe including Spanish and International luorocco, Spanish and Portuguese Atlantic Islands and Turkey, a document stating that goods loaded at yourport are covered by export licences or ao not require export licences, as the case may be. This procedure will not apply to ships all of whose cargo is fbr United Kingdom or £ire. (2. In the case of ships loadeds t outpofcfes. the document referred to above will have to be issued by the Customs Co llectors of the respective outports. Necessary instructions may therefore be issued to those officers at once, and arrange ments may also be mr.de to ensure that they are provided with copies or all notifications issued in connection v ith Export (Tohtrol from time to time.) 3.

Goverrvaent of India have decided to introduce a combined form of application per copy enclosed, for ship ments to any port in Continental Europe, including Spanish and International Morocco, Spanish aiia rortu/^uese Atlantic Islancs and Turkey. This should be brought into force from the 20th August 1940. Under these arrangements, applications should be made in triplicate. The original iTill constitute the licence proper after the necessary entries are filled in by the Expert Trade Controller, aud will accompany the shipment, thus forming part of the ship’s papers. The duplicate will be retained by the shipper and the triplicate will be recorded in the .xport r &gt;8.de Controller’s Office. 2. The following instructions should be carefully observed in this connection. (1) Licences in the form now prescribed are required toaccompany the goods shipped only in the case of exports to destinations specified in para.raph 1 . (2) Entries in the forms should preferably be typewrit ten but the applications need not be rejected if the entries are written legibly in ink. (3; In cases where licences are refused, the words n not grented” should be written in bold letters across the space reserved for use in the Export - Trade Controller’s Office. A rubber stamp may be used for this purpose. (4) A note should be made in the ship’s'manifest against each entry in respect of licensed gpods to the effect that the goods ire accompanied by an export licence, the number of the licence being also inserted. 3. Four hundred copies of each of the three foms are being sent separately for present use.

It would be premature to restrict thesw by quotas but I suggest individual applications for export licences in India should be scrutinised with care and referred if necessary to Political Agent, Kuwait, and Beirut transactions which are in any way suspect should be refused licences. Applications for exports from Ceylon (the only colony known to be closely concerned) could similarly be referred if thought useful to Political Agent, Kuwait, or to proposed Persian Gulf War Trade Survey Office.

For a basis from which to prepare an estimate of imports, the whole of the imports of the year 194 o were totalled and classified From these the essential imports were extracted Ind render^ Into tons, i.e. ’long 1 tons of 2,240 lbs aaob, with the exception of building materials (chiefly chundals) which cannot but be treated as packages. O' MEMORANDUM:- The resulting totals are:- lantity imported into Bahrain: ' re-exported to Arabia: ' consumed in Bahrain: Tons. 40,478. 19.698. 20.780/ Packages: 60,265. 36.960, 23,305. In support of these figures, I attach a schedule of the quantities of the relative commodities which, in my opinion, are essential to the life of Bahrain. It should be remembered that these figures apply to the year 1940 which, while not a peak year, may be re/garded as a little below the normal. The exigencies of war may reduce this figure for 1941 , and later. I would therefore suggest, as a basic figure for one year, Z/ a T.oi.fll of twentv-four thousand tons for consumption in Bahrain, flnd Q twenty-two thousand tons for T^nsit through Bahrain to Saudi- Arabia it being remembered that these are long tons, not shipping tons. ’ Building materials cannot be regulated, as they mostly come / forward from Africa by native craft; and this traffic snould not ,/V^e interfered with. The monthly average could reasonably be xwo thousand tons for Bahrain, and two thousand tons for Saudi-Arabia. 0 Monthly statements of imports and exports and re-exports are being regularly submitted, please.

Sir, Having teen given to understand that some posts of clerks in the Upper Division cadre have to he filled in hy you due to increase in Customs work in your Department, I heg to apply for one of them* 2. I joined the Karachi Custom House in tie year 1934 as a clerk. During my service of over 7 years, I have been discharging my duties to the entire satisfaction of my superiors. I have had occasion to work in the Import- Export section of the Karachi Custom House for about four years during which period, I acquired a thorough knowledge of Customs law and procedure. 3. At the outbreak of the War, a separate section called 'WAR SECTION' was constituted in Hie Custom House and I was one of the fe\« specially selected and deputed to work in that new section. Consequartly, I got the opportunity to make myself familiar with the operation of the Export Trade Control Schemejand the Enemy Trading work. After the introduction of Import Trade Control, I was posted to work in that branch and was entrusted with licensing work. I am conversant with the Customs work and the Control regulations and other War work connected therewith, which, I am sure, will be of immense use to me in the discharge of the duties which may be entrusted to me. I am also well up in noting and drafting.

The one special-grade Interpreter sanctioned for Bahrain under the War Estabtt. has been attached to the Censor and Publicity Office. The E.Q., much to the dislocation of its work, has to manage with a part-time record-clerk only. The passport clerk has to put in three hours a day only for this work and for the remaining of the work we have to nage as best as we can. It is of course well known to you that the work in the Accounts Department, in view of the inclusion of the work of the Political Officer Trucial Coast, Medical Officer Trucial Coast and the Publicity Officer in the Persian Gulf, is already getting too much for one hand to cope with. The Arabic Office in view of the un-expected long leave of the Indian Asstt. have been working short-handed since August last. In C.O. cypher work has increased to such an extent that one clerk can hardly cope with it during the office hours, more so because of all the Publicity Office cypher work which has fallen on C.O. The other one clerk has to attend to all the Outwarding, Inwarding, typing and record work single- handed. In these circumstances any additional work on ■^he existing staff would not be possible without prejudicing the health and efficiency of the clerks. The work connected with the issue of export certificates would not be of nature to be distributed indiscriminately amongst the present staff but will require at least one whole-time clerk to deal with it efficiently. I mention one clerk only on the presumption that the out door work and checking of cargo loading will be done by the staff of the Bhrain Customs. In order to give you an idea of the extent of rr *■work involved I give below a few particulars about the export trade of Bahrain, (a) The total export from 1st April 1940 to 31st December 1940 amounted to Rs.23,83,600/-. (b) The exports have been made to the following countries. Arabia Iraq Iran Mekran Coast India Africa U.S.A. Australia China Ceylon, Newzealand Palestine Java Malaya State etc. (c) The goods exported practically cover every aspect of the Gulf trade. In the s end I may add that we all should be grateful if you would request P.A. to apply for at least one more clerk under the Temporary War Establishment to deal with this additional work..^V The additional \vork involved in extending the Export Licensing System to Bahrain will be:- (1) , the additional clerical work involved in checking the exports, referring certain cases to the India Office and issuing certificates, and (2) , the work of tallying exports with permits at the place of loading. One extra clerk will be required for the former,(1). The Latter, (2), I take it will be done by the Bahrain Port Officer. No extra staff will be required in this office, although he my require an extra man. - ... * H- 'J r o- ,, r . iw y/.r- ». ( n ,. N°. P .^ AO- ^ S ' C! ' S ' a v.,.

The figures for steamers from July to March have been obtained by deducting the dhow figures from the total imports in long tons; from April to June we have not yet the monthly figures of imports and exports lnor has the D. of so the steamer figures for those months had to be taken from the lists of manifested cargo of indivi dual ships, which had to be converted from bales, packages, cases, etc., into long tons and can therefore only be taken as approximate. They show, incidentally (after liberel conversion) fchxi in those three months only 69% o~ impots as having been made by steamer as against -j ' su rge for the whole sailing season of 875; their figures re as follows:-- Steamers 2859, Dhows 1047, Total o406. The Dubai and Sharjah figures (in cwt .) are as follows:-- On the assumption that the A.Sharjah's estimate on p.58 ports by dhow amount to 20$ of the total imports to Dubai and Sharjah, i.e.58,619 cwt.r-then the total figures for all the T.C. ports (assuming that the percentage of the other T.C. ports' imports to arrive during the off season will be the same as/i^orts by dhov to Dubai and Sharjah,) are as follows: — Dhows.

This control can be exercised with the least inconvenience to traders at its source and operates in two ways* (a) by Navicert aygter. in roapect of exports from neutral territory e.g. Iran and io) by isixport Licencing in respect of exports from British or allied territory. The la^tter ae^ms more appropriate in respect of protected Arab States and Muscat. The existing absence of control in Arab States over export of all commodities Uxcept oil from Bahrain) tc cempulicry Navicert eree might ceust countries in this area to increase their purenasee from Arab States end encourage re-export particularly to : yria of commodities not purchased in Arab states with a vievi to evading control exercised on export of euch goods from their place of production.
