Craftsmen glazed faience pieces in three different ways. The simplest and oldest method involved brushing the object with, or immersing it in, liquid glaze before firing. Alternatively, workers mixed a crystalline mineral salt with the faience and allowed it to evaporate to the surface while the object dried. This mineral salt then melted and fused into a glaze during firing. In the third technique, an artisan buried the object in a glazing powder that fused with the core during firing. To decorate faience objects, craftsmen painted on designs before firing or mixed the moist faience paste with mineral colorants. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nUnlike faience, glass was a foreign import that arrived in Egypt from western Asia shortly before 1500 <small>B.C.E.</small> The first Egyptian glassmakers relied on molds, limiting production to small objects such as beads and amulets. Later craftsmen perfected techniques that allowed for large, complex pieces.  <b><br />\r\n<br />\r\nVessels<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAncient Egyptian artists produced vessels in both glass and faience, producing different effects with each material. </b><br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Egyptians began manufacturing glass vessels during the Eighteenth Dynasty reign of Thutmose III (circa 1479&ndash;1425 <small>B.C.E.</small>). Early examples, valued for their rarity and beauty, were luxury items used to store precious oils and perfumes. Craftsmen produced striking effects by adding threads of colored glass to a vessel&rsquo;s surface while it was still hot and then dragging a pointed object across the surface to produce festooned patterns. The artist who made the fish flask shown here indicated the animal&rsquo;s scales by pressing blue powdered glass down into the interior. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nEarly scholars often incorrectly characterized faience as simply an inexpensive substitute for glass, but recent research suggests that the Egyptians favored the material because of its attractive color and its association with water, the source of creation. A characteristic type of Eighteenth Dynasty faience vessel is the shallow bowl. Early in the dynasty, artists painted the interiors of these bowls with marsh scenes including fish and water plants; later painters introduced human figures.", "summary": "", "rank": 0, "label_date": "2016-03-01", "date_added": "2016-04-12 16:30:22", "approved_for_web": 1}], "artists": [], "collections": [{"id": 5, "name": "Egyptian, Classical, Ancient Near Eastern Art", "folder": "egyptian", "rank": 0}], "exhibitions": [{"id": 648, "title": "Egypt Reborn: Art for Eternity"}, {"id": 3329, "title": "Ancient Egyptian Art"}], "related_items": [{"accession_number": "14.610", "object_id": 3108}], "geographical_locations": [], "videos": [], "images": [{"filename": "CUR.16.580.176_NegA_print_bw.jpg", "id": 136319, "standard_size_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size2/CUR.16.580.176_NegA_print_bw.jpg", "thumbnail_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size0_sq/CUR.16.580.176_NegA_print_bw.jpg", "derivatives": [{"size": "0", "width": 76, "height": 96}, {"size": "1", "width": 153, "height": 192}, {"size": "2", "width": 306, "height": 384}, {"size": "3", "width": 612, "height": 768}, {"size": "4", "width": 1224, "height": 1536}], "largest_derivative_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size4/CUR.16.580.176_NegA_print_bw.jpg", "largest_derivative": "4", "description": null, "caption": " <em>Fragment of Bowl with Lotus, Antelope, and Fish</em>, ca. 1539-1390 B.C.E.
