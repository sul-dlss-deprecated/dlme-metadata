MEMORANDUM. /t 'b Reference your Memorandum No.6281 dated 23rd February 1919 to Political Agent, Koweit, forwarding the draft Order in Council for Koweit. I have discussed the question fully with that Officer. His principal desiderata are:- (a) a legal position vis-a-vis British and European and American subjects in Koweit. This would bo adequately provided as regards British subjects by Parts (1) to (4), (6) and (7) of the Draft Order. But* nothing in the draft Order provides for the vexed question of jurisdiction in the case of foreign subjects with respect to whom no Treaty exists (para 8 (3)). The Draft Order, for instance, leaves the Americans where they are now, that is, without anyone who can perform any legal act with respect to them; on the other hand the Shaikh is under agreement with us to have no direct dealings with a t . Foreign State. The point is admittedly a very difficult one y and I only mention it to draw attention to the fact that the Draft does not deal with it, T^ie only possible solution is to communicate our treaties with Kov/eit to the American Govern ment (I think it likely that this has already been done), and ask their consent to our performing specified legal functions in respect of their nationals, but I.do not think it likely that they would agree. I fear the question can only be left, (b) a legal position vis-a-vis subjests of Persia, independe^ ' Arab/ chiefs, and especially Iraq. As regards the first, J seens very improbable thit any Persian Government would g' its official consent to any exercise of jurisdiction eve natinationals in Koweit. It is a kind of point upon which they would probably be very touchy. An informal arrangement not to raise the point if we do undertake the defence of Persian interests, is the most we could hope for, I should think, until things in Tehran have moved a long way. As regards the second, we have just conceded to the shaikh of Bahrain direct Jurisdiction over his very class of person, and it would be regarded by shaikh Salim as a direct blow at his dignity if we assumed jurisdiction, e.g., over subjects of iiin Saud by a direct agreement with the latter. In the absence of such an agreement, this jurisdiction is directly conceded to tie Shaikh by section 44 (4). As regards the third category, it is obviously impossible to legislate for them until their international status is defined. Meanwhile, we saw no parti cular advantage in the enactment of Part 5 of the Draft Order, It only regulates the existing practice,- weakening the political Agent's.hands pro tanto by the admission in paras. 44 (4) and 45 (4) • that the Political Agents legal powers are limited to a right to be present at the hearing and final decision. It appeared to us that either the Huler would be amenable, in which case it is better not to notify to all and sundry that we reaetve no power of legal insistence, or he will be contu- macious, in which case these two sections will be a weapon in his hands. If it is considered necessary to have a regular procedure prescribed for the hearing of cases between Koweit subjects arid 'persons to whom the order applies', it would seem prefer able to arrange this diplomatically with the Chief himself, without expressly laying down a limitation on the Political Agent's powers of interference. The net result of the above is that we do not consider there is any practical advantage in the enactment of any parts V of the Draft Order, other than those intended to regularise the legal position of the Political Agent vis-a-vis British / subjects; it is on the other hand evident that some definition of the international position of Iraq subjects will necessarily yoon be laid down, and it would be advisable to incorporatethis into any order in council that may be issued. We therefore considered it advisable to wait until this defi nition is arrived at before proceeding further with the matter; and I think it is for consideration whether it would not be possible to proceed wiWi the drafting of an Order for the whole Gulf, as soon as the status of Iraq is determined, I am forwarding a copy of this memorandum to the Political Agent, Koweit.

(3) In cases tried under this article no different sentence can he passed from the sentence which could be passed in England if the crime were tried there. (4) The foregoing provisions of this article shall be deemed to be adaptations, for the purposes of this Order and . of the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1890, of the following en actments, namely:— ' The Admiralty Offences (Colonial) Act, 1849; The Admiralty Offences ('Colonial) Act, 1860; The Merchant Shipping Act 1894, Part Xlll; and those enactments shall apply accordingly, and be admin istered in Kuwait.20.

(2) The Court, by order in writing under its seal, may vary any order of prohibition (not extending the duration thereof), and may revoke any order of prohibition or re moval. (:{) The Court shall forthwith report the order and the grounds thereof to the Chief Court, which shall forthwith report to the Governor-General of India in Council every order made under this article, and the grounds thereof, and the poceedings thereunder. 22.—(1 &gt; If any British subject fails to give security for good behaviour or for keeping the peace when lawfully re quired to do so, or fails to comply with an order of prohibi tion made under this Order, the Chief Court or the District Court may, if it thinks fit, order that he be deported from any place within its jurisdiction as prescribed by this Order. (2) If the order of deportation is made by the District Court, it shall forthwith report to the Chief Court the order and the grounds thereof. (•}) Thereupon the person ordered to be deported shall, unless the Chief Court thinks fit otherwise to direct, be as soon as practicable, and in the case of a person convicted either after execution of the sentence or while it is in course of execution, removed in custody under warrant to the place named in the warrant.

Reference your Mernorandum Wo .6i38l/7/37 dated 23rd February 1919 and the late Mr.Bill's Memorandum Ho.562 dated 7th April 1919. Has anything further been done about fcne Koweit Order- in CouncilY My experience at Bahrain was that the Americans only required notarial acts, and registration of documents and of births, deaths and man-iages etc, and that provided that there was no American Consul present, they and presumably the American Courts, were quite prepared to accept notarial acts done by British Consuls or notaries public, 30 that,for most of their business, the proposed Order-in-Council would suffice. It would not of course give the political Agent criminal or civil jurisdiction o*er therii, but they would not often render,themselves liable criminally, and in civil cases, I am sure, they would gladly avail thsmselves of the assistance Of the political Agent. I notice that in your draft letter to v »^vemment you mention the poaslbility of a si'-'le general Orzier-in-Council for the Arabian Coaat. I submit t^at t^ia aiflarence/ in status between the various states and principalities - would make it very difficult to have a general oraer - differ^ncM ranging as they do from independence (theoretical, but guaranteed) in the case of 'Muscat, through prctectcrate fotl external and maritime matter? on the i^ciai Coaet to complete r^roterto -^teprotectorate in the case of Bahrain, Again would it not be better to keep the portiondjof which are British protect orates distinct from Hasa and Katif, which presuTiably will ^e administered by Great Britain as Mandatory of the League of Nations?. For these reasons I would suggest it wo^ld be better to let the Orders in Muscat and Bahrain remain as they are^ the Resident, Persian dulf, being the principal political authority, a ne* one on the lines suggested being introduced for Koweit. The Bahrain Order-in-Council might poaalbly be extended to Katr, and a new and very simple Order being introduced later for the r ^ucial Coast, Later taxpK on perhaps when a special political officer is appointed another Order could be introduced for Central Arabia, and Hasa and Katif with the High Commissioner at Baghdad as Chief Political authority.

In view of thig unfavourable afetiiude it waa^ ,/) decided oo abandon the iden of a unified Crder-in-Council, to pa33 a Jeraian Coast and Islmcte (amendant) Order in Council, ^id oo:\proceed yi th the draft Bahrein Order that las been hel d up pending the con3i derAiion of the larger que3tion. The question of the exten3ion of -m Order in Council to the Trucial Chiefs was left over until a aeutle'nent had been arrived at with Turkey in regard to the Arab littoral. 5. By the An/rlo-Turki ah Convention of Jul3/ 29, IQ^, respecting the Persian Gulf and Adjacent Territories an arrangement was concluded in regard to Koweit (Articles 1 - 10). By tig terms of the agreement the Sheikh was recognised as Kjlmakam of an autonomous Kaza of the Ottoman ffinpire; the ooundaries of h: 3 3 mediate territory and his vriler 1 tribal jurisdiction were delimited; t^.e Ottoman Government recognised existing agreements between the Sheikfi and His 'laiesty'a Government, and TT is I'ajesty'a Government undertook, on their Dirt, not to alter the nature of British relations with the Government of Koweit or to establish a protectorate there, so long as the status quo, as ie f i ne d i n the Co nv en t i 0 n, un de rwen t no ch ange. The Convention has, however, never been ratified. 6. In September 1914 several assurances were given to the Sheikh of Koweit in return for the valuable co-operation which was expected from him inthe event of a war wi th Turkey, one of the assurances being that Koweit/shoul d be recognised as an indepen dent principality under British protection. These^ as durances ^nve been renewed on several subsequent occasions. Foreign Office, July 16th, 1921.Political Agency, Kuwait. 4th BecemlDer 1921. J. G. More, Political Agent, Kuwait .he ecretary to h.L. the High Commiaaioner for 'Iraq, BAGHDAD. bir # -I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your memorandum liO.18279/7/37, dated the 17th October 1921, rela tive to the proposed Kuwait Order in Council. 2. I have aaaurned that in 'broad terms it is intended to adhere to the draft Order in Council forwarded under cover of the Acting Civil Commissioner's memorandum No. 38114, dated the 22nd December 1919 # in which a •foreigner' is defined as 'any person not a British or Kuwait subject, and a 'Kuwait subject'', as 'a subject of the r aikh of Kuwait, * or the nubject, resident at Kuwait, of any .ther non-Chri.- tian power not represented ty a consul at Kuwait'. 3. According to these definitions the only foreigners at present resident in Kuwait ^horn I am able to trace are:- unericans 6 heae are all Eiembers of the Ai erican * i ^sion 'tnd the number is not likely to be increased. The only American visitors are miasionaries who occasionally come •ashore for a few hours when passing through, and, at rare intervals an American steamer which calls at the port. -iQ.ytu^uese subjects 4,- wo vioaiiese families, both in the regular service of British subjects, o Portuguese subjects except CrOaiies© l visit Kuwait, and they, only for service with British subjects or Americans. rench subjec^s^- he only rench subject whom I have beena^ble to trace is an Algerian mendicant. Thrrc iray, howevei 'be a few others of whom I am unaware, as natives of French jomaliland occasionally find their way to Kv.r&amp;.lt as members of the crews of sailing vessels, Italian sub.iects .- There are none resident at present, 'but sailors from Eritrea occasionally visit Kuwait. upanish suldects .- I have never heard of any visiting Kuwait 'but an occasional pilgrim or mendicant from Spanish lorroco may possibly do so, 4. I have sounded the Dhaikh of Kuwait and am satisfied that he would raise no objection to Kis Majesty's Government exercising jurisdiction over the ahove classes, in addition, of course,to British subjects, and also to Kuwait subjects registered as 'being in the permanent service of British subjects. 5. Unless strong pressure wore brought to bear upon him, he would not agree to British jurisdiction being exercised over the subjects of non-Ghristian Powers, with the except ion of Japanese and Chinese. No subjects of either power are resident in Kuwait, but steamers of both countries do visit the territorial waters at rare intervals, 6. Of the subjects of non-Christian powers resident in Kuwait who are not actual subjects of the Shaikh of Kuwait the two most numerous classes are the Persians and the Najdis. I estimate that there are at present about 10,^00 persons of Persian origin in Kuwait town; many of these, however, have been settled here for two or three generations and have presumably^-lost their Persian nationality. As there is no form of registration it is impossible to say how many actual Persian subjects there are; the number is probably over 6,000, though I doubt if 5,000 could, or would take th&lt; trouble to, prove their nationality if the question were raised. In addition to the Persians permanently and tempora rily settled in Kuwait, a considerable number of Persian sailing boats visit the port annually. It is still harder to estimate the number of Najd subjects, as the great majority of the inhabitants of Kuwait are of Najd origin,case of Bedouin accompanying caravan®. The same appllea in a lesser degree to the suhjects of Bahrain and the other Ara'b principalities of the Persian Gulf. There are no Hijaz subjects actually settled in Kuwait, 'but an average 01 perhaps thirty pass throug annually, largely mendicants on route for Iraq. There are at present twelve Turkish subjects in the town. 7. It is impossible even to give the number of British subjects accurately, as there is a considerable, and iluctuating, number of Somalis and other Africans under British protection, largely sailors, who never come near the Agency, except occasionally when they requir# the help of the Political Agent. I estimate, however, that there are at present 176 British subjects in the town, made up as follows British 4 British Indians 22 Arabs with British nationality £1 Egyptian 1 bomalis 6c other Africans under British protection. about lOO Total 175. o these may be added 36 Kuwait subjects and foreigners i (including the four Portuguese subjects mentioned in para graph 3 above) in the permanent service of British subjects, who, in practice, always have been looked on as British subjects while thus employed. About 200 Indians, crews of sailing boats, pilgrims, etc., visit Kuwait annually, and, with :ew exceptions, the steamers which visit the port are all British ships, 8. I have not included ^ 'Iraqis, regarding whose status i rererred in my memorandum No. 64-G dated the 12th April 1921, under any of the above heads. I presume that they are wntijied to —ritish protection, but up to the present no • Iraqi has applied to me for assistance as such, ' here is much intercourse between 'Iraq and Kuwait, and the number oi 'Iraqi- in the torn is considerable , but, as in the cast ox- there Is little Dy which one can a istin&gt;;u , &gt;ftthem from the ordinary inhabitant*, and it rould 'be useless to attempt to estimate their number without actually registej ing them and inquiring into doubtful cases. The Shaikh of Kuwait would certainly prefer f Iraa subjects to be under his own Jurisdiction, but I do not think he is likely t6 prove obstinate if the matter be pressed, Palestine and Syrian subjects, as British and French protected persons respective ly, misht conveniently be considered under this head. Neither are at present settled in, or frequently visit Kxiwait, and the Question would not greatly interest the Shaikh. 9. I presume from the wording of the draft Order in Council that there is no intention of asking the Shaikh of Kuwait to agree to His Majesty's Government exercising Jurisdiction with respect to the subjects of non-Christian powers referred to in paragraph 6 above. I am of opinion that to do so would almost certainly lead to friction with the Shaikh of Kuwait, Bj without proportionately increasing British trade or prestige | - 1 and that it would therefore not be in our interests to do so ! unless, or until, any of the 'Rulers or Governments concerned request us to do so, or wish to establish consuls of their own. If I be right in this assumption, I would suggest that the word 'iruslim' might be substituted for 'non-Christian' in the definition of a 'Kuwait subject' referred to in para graph 2 above, and that the Shaikh of Kuwait be definitely asked to agree to the exercise of Jurisdiction by His lajesty*® Government in respect of all 'foreigners', which latter term would then include the classes enumerated in paragraph 3 above, together with any European, American. Japanese or Chinese steamers which might at any time visit the port. As, in practice, this would mean little more than recognising British jurisdiction with respect to the members of the American Mission, I think he would readily agree to it as also he would in the case of Kuwait subjects in the regu lar service of British subjects or foreigners, on the condi tions laid down in sub-section 3 of paragraph 8 of the draft Order in Council. 10. As I am certain that, in practice, the Shailch r/ould. not^3'? AMrioans or the Portuguese subjects (even if he icnows that the latter are not British suhjeots) without refereno to me, I see no immediate urgency for the Order in Council 'being passed.

In L'ay and June 1911 the India Office forwarded copies of a long correspondence that had 'been carried on 'between the Government of India and the British 'Resident in the Persian Gulf, suggesting the amendment of the 'Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council, 190?' so as to hrins within its scope : jna;umerah with its dependencies tne coast and Maratime provinces of Persia from Mohammerah (P,19367/1911) to Owettur, 'both inclusive, and the islands of the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman lying within the Persian dominions. The India Office concurred as to the desirability of those alterations and asked that if His Majesty's Minister at Tehran were of the same opinion, the necessary steps shoul 'be taken for the issue of the amending, Order, It was felt nere, however, that the proposals in question were inadequate and merely tinkered at a question that required more drastic treatment, and that the political and Judicial spheres of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf should 'be rendered coincident 'by putting into force a Persian Gulf Order-in-Council provid ing for the exercise of Jurisdiction in all the territorie 'bordering upon the Gulf in which administrative control was vested in the Resident, and consequently superseding the existing Persian Coast and Islands and Muscat Orders and rendering superfluous the contemplated separate Order ■i for Bahrein. Courts should 'be established wherever officials were to 'be found fit to exercise Judicial powers and provision should 'be made to vary them with comparative ease, 2. It was proposed that there should 'be a superior court to 'be held by the 'Resident or 'by a person specially appointed for the purpose, to which appeals would lie from the local courts. The law and machinery of the Order49032 (File 19367/ 1911) . tLe Order, within tne limits of which would 'be included Muscat, the Trucial States, Bahrein and Koweit, would T^e similar to that provided in the Persian Coast and Islands Order 0 3 e The Government of India, hov/ever, agreed with the Political Resident in thinking that such a single comprehensive Order p embracing hot., the Persian and tho jLrah Littoral of the Persian G-ulf, was undesirable even if practicable, and that the most that could 'be done would 'be to have an Order in Council that would cover the A-i-ab principalities from Koweit to Muscat inclusive, 4 o In view of this unfavourable attitude it was decided to abandon the Idea of a unified Order-in-Council to pass a Persian Coast and Islands (amendment) Qrder-in- Council, and to proceed with the draft Bahrein Order that had l)een held up pending the consideration of the larger question. The Question of the extension of an O^der-in-Oouncil to the Trucial Chiefs was left over until a settlement had been arrived at with Turkey in regard to the Arab littoral. 5, By the Anglo-Turkish Convention of July £9, 191S, respecting the Persian Gulf and Adjacent Territories an arrangement was concluded in regard to Koweit (Articles 1 -10). By the terms of the agreement the Sheikh was recognised as Kairaakam of an autonomous kaza of the Ottoman Empire; the boundaries of his immediate territo^j, and his wider tribal jurisdiction were delimited; the Ottoman Government recognised existing agreements betweej the Sheikh and His Majesty's Government; and His Tvlajestia Government undertook, on their part, not to alter the nature of British relations with the Government of Koweit or to establish a protectorate there, so long as the status quo, as defined in the Convention, underwent no change. The convention has, however, never been ratified.. ^■ntember 1914 several assurances weretike Sheikh of Kov/eit in re turn for the valuable co-- operation which was expected from him in the event of * y war with Turkey, one of the assurances 'being that Koweit should he recognised as an independent principality unuer British protection« These assurances have 'been renewed on several subsequent occasions.

I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your memorandum xSo. 18279- 7-37, dated the 17th October 1921, relative to the proposed Kuwait Order-in-CounciL 2. I have assumed that in broad terms it is intended to adhere to the draft- Order-in-Council forwarded under cover of the Acting Civil Commissioner s me morandum No. 38114, dated the 22nd December 1919 {see Enclo. of Pro. No. 22 in G. B., Octr. 1922, Nos. 22-38), in which a 'foreigner' is defined as ' any person not a British or Kuwait subject, and a ' Kuwait subject,' as a subject of the Shaikh of Kuwait, or the subject, resident at Kuwait, of any other non-Christian power not represented by a Consul at Kuwait.' 3. According to these definitions the only foreigners at present resident in Kuwait whom I am able to trace are :— Americans 6. —These are all members of the American Mission and the number is not likely to be increased. The only American visitors are missionaries who occasionally come ashore for a few hours when passing through, and, at rare intervals an American steamer which calls at the port. Portuguese subjects 4. —Two Goanese families, both in the regular service of British subjects. No Portuguese subjects, except Goanese, visit Kuwait, and they, only for service with British subjects or Ameri cans. French subjects. —The only French subject whom I have been able to trace is an Algerian mendicant. There may, however, be a few others of whom I am unaware, as natives of French Somaliland occasionally find their way to Kuwait as members of the crews of sailing vessels. Italian subjects. —There are none resident at present, but sailors from Erilrea occasionally visit Kuwait. Spanish subjects. —I have never heard of any visiting Kuwait but an occa sional pilgrim or mendicant from Spanish Morroco may possibly do so. 4. I have sounded the Shaikh of Kuwait and am satisfied that he would raise no objection to His Majesty's Government exercising jurisdiction over the above classes, in addition, of course, to British subjects, and also to Kuwait subjects registered as being in the permanent service of British subjects. 5. Unless strong pressure were brought to bear upon him, he would not agree to British jurisdiction being exercised over the subjects of non-Christian Powers, with the exception of Japanese and Chinese. No subjects of either power are resident in Kuwait, but steamers of both countries do visit the territorial waters at rare intervals. f 1 - - a. * • w • • . 6. Of the subjects of non-Christian powers resident in Kuwait who are not actual subjects of the Shaikh of Kuwait the two most numerous classes are the Persians and the Najdis. I estimate that there are at present about 10,000 persons of Persian origin in Kuwait town ; many of these, however, have been settled here for two or three generations and have presumably lost their Persian nationali ty. As there is no form of registration it is impossible to say how many actual Persian subjects there are ; the number is probably over 6,000, though I doubt if 5,000 could, or would take the trouble to, prove their nationality if the question were raised. In addition to the Persians permanently and temporarily settled in Kuwait, a considerable number of Persian sailing boats visit the port annually. It is still harder to estimate the number of Najd subjects, as the great majority of the inhabitants of Kuwait are of Najd origin, case of Bedouin accompanying caravans. The same applies in a lesser degree to the subjects of Bahrain and the other Arab principalities of the Persian Gulf. There are no Hijaz subjects actually settled in Kuwait, but an average of perhaps thirty pass through annually, largely mendicants en route for 'Iraq. There are at present twelve Turkish subjects in the town. MC683FD7. It is impossible even to give the number of British subjecis accurately, as there is a considerable, and fluctuating, number of Somalis and other Africans under British protection, largely sailors, who never come near the Agency, except occasionally when they require the help of the Political Agent. I estimate, how ever, that there are at present 175 British subjects in the town, made upas follows : British ,. .. .. .. .. • • 4 British Indians .. .. .. .. .. 22 Arabs with British nationality .. .. .. 21 Egyptian .. .. .. .. .. 1 Somalis and other Africans under British protection, about 100 Total .. .. 175 To these may be added 36 Kuwait subjects and foreigners (including the four Portuguese subjects mentioned in paragraph 3 above) in the permanent service of British subjects, who, in practice, always have been looked on as British subjects while thus employed. About 200 Indians, crews of sailing boats, pilgrims, etc., visit Kuwait annually, and, with few exceptions, the steamers which visit the port are all British ships. 8. I have not included 'Iraqis, regarding whose status I referred in my memo, randum ^'o. 64-C., dated the 12th April 1921, under any of the above heads. I presume that they are entitled to British protection, but up to the present no 'Iraqi has applied to me for assistance as such. There is much intercourse between 'Iraq and Kuwait, and the number of 'Iraqis in the town is considerable, but, as in the case of Najdis, there is little by which one can distinguish them from the ordinary inhabitants, and it would be useless to attempt to estimate their number without actually registering them and inquiring into doubtful cases. The Sheikh of Kuwait would certainly prefer 'Iraq subjects to be under his own jurisdiction, but I do not think he is likely to prove ^obstinate if the matter be pressed. Palestine and Syrian subjects, as British and French protected persons respectively, might conveniently be considered under this head. Neither are at pressnt sattle 1 or frequently visit Kuwait, and the question would not greatly interest the Sheikh. 9. I presume from the wording of the draft Order in Council that there is no intention of asking the Shaikh of Kuwait to agree to His Majesty's Government exercising jurisdiction with respect to the subjects of non-Christian powers refer red to in paragraph 6 above. I am of opinion that to do so would almost certainly lead to friction with the Shaikh of Kuwait, without proportionately increasing British trade or prestige and that it would therefore not be in our interests to do so, unless, or until, any of the Rulers or Governments concerned request us to do so, or wish to establish Consuls of their own. If I be right in this assumption, I would suggest that the word ' Muslim ' might be substituted for ' non-Chris tian ' in the definition of a ' Kuwait subject' referred to in paragraph 2 above, and that the Shaikh of Kuwait be definitely asked to agree to the exercise of juris diction by His Majesty's Government in respect of all ' foreigners,' which latter term would then include the classes enumerated in paragraph 3 above, together with any European, American, Japanese or Chinese steamers which might at any time visit the port. As, in practice, this would mean little more than recognising British jurisdiction with respect to the members of the American Mission, I think he would readilv agree to it as also he would in the case of Kuwait subjects in the regular service of British subjects of foreigners, on the conditions laid down in sub section 3 of paragraph 8 of the draft Order in Council. 10. As I am certain that, in practice, the Shaikh would not deal with Americans or the Portuguese subjects (even if he knows that the latter are not British sub jects) without reference to me, I see no immediate urgency for the Order in Council being passed.kO The Ke^idency, Baghdad the i5th Jaiiu^ry 1^22* 11 /4 /16 To Political Agent Kuwait* MeniorandU'TU The attached despatch dated 15th Jaouary 1922 to Secretary of ^tate for the Colonies, iondon, without enoloeuree, on the eubject of Order-in- Counoil for Kuwait, ie forwarded, reference your Confidential letter ^o«206-C« dated 4th December, 1921.

It is assumed that by 'definite British super- vision H Sir P.Cox means no more than jurisdiction over Pritish and other foreign subjects in Koweit to the extent exercised by His Majesty^ representative in e.g Bahrein. / From correspondence which passed between the Foreign Office and the India office before the war (notably Foreign Office letter No. 29563 /11 dated August 31st 1911) it would appear* that at that time the Foreign Office saw no objection to the application of the Order in Council regime to Koweit.

His Grace's predecessor decided that no further progress could be made m the matter pending the conclusion of a Treaty of Peace with Turkey. As, however, a Treaty has now been signed at Lausanne and will snortly enter into force ; His Grace is disposed to thirk that perliminarv steps might now advmtageously be taken with a view \o the promulrration of an Order in Council for Koweit so soon as the Jreaty of Lausanne becomes operative. His Grace has examined the draft Order in Council which accompanied your letter under reference, and. subject to any considerations which may be present to the Foreign Office to whom a copy ol this letter has been sent, he sees no political objections to its terms.

Sir, With reference to your letter No. 25067/23 of the ISth instant, enclosing s copy of a letter to the India Office - r- • relative to the proposed nromulpation of an Order in Council for Koweit, I am directed by the Marquess Curzon of Kedleston to invite the attention of the Duke of Devonshire to the second naraPTsph of my Letter of the 11 th April 1922, ^^ ' ;ss pointed out therein thst the issue of an Order in Council containing a provision for British jurisdiction over foreigners in Koweit mi^ht be liable to evoke protests from foreisn Powers, and it was su^prested that it would, therefore, be well to obtain the formal consent of the United States, the French, the Italian, the Portuguese and the Japanese Governments to the opwfovrri before issuiniT the Order in Council. 3. T^e Secretary of State remains of opinion that, if it is ^ desired to rromul^ste the ^rder in Council as originally drafted , and enclosed in India Office letter of the 12th May 1920, it would be desirable to obtain the formal assent of the above Powers. It is not, ifcexx however, considered that the present, or indeed the near future, is a propitious time for approaching these Powers with a proposal of this nature. 1 am, therefore, to suggest as an alternative, for His ^ Grace 1 s consideration, that article 8(2) of the draft Order in Council be amended to read 'Foreipners with respect to whom Sheikh of Koweit and the gpvernments of oJLAi£&gt;i_ilLey. are nationals have a.qreed with His ' Majesty for, or consented to, the exercise of jurisdiction H by His Majesty'. 5. Thus amended the Order in Council can be nromul£rated as soon as the Treaty of Lausanne shall have come into force, with out it being necessary for His Majesty^ Government to approach any foreign Power on the subject until such time as a national of a foreieri Power commits some crime or misdemeanour necessitatingnecessitating proceedinfrs agsinst him. In such an event His IiiO^esty's Government would ask the government of the national concerned whether Ti tr m the^ desired tbst the esse sbould be dealt with under the lioweit Order in Oouncil. 6. i4 copy of this Letter is bein^r sent to the India Office. - I am, etc-, 3d.Lancelot uliphant The Under Secretary of State, Colonial Office.V Jt in requested i'uat in any further communi- cw jh on this xvbject the under-mentioned letter and number may be quoted, and the reply addressed to— The Under Secretary of State for India, Political Department, India Office, London, S.

THE KING'S I.roST iSKCEU.ENT MAJESTY IN COUNCIL has now been po..,. in as you enumerate^ and you aek me to acknowledge this. As you know, I am by God's grace sincere and loyal to His Majesty, and I am glad that Justice and equity be given to the P people, but the points which you described x a xx were not quite dear to me and I could not understand with certainty what you meant, so I discussed the matter verbally with you on Wednes day evening, and I gather from what you say that what is really meant is the settling of cases connected with Brltieh subjects, the subjects of foreign Powers, and people employed British subjects at Kuwait. If this be the meaning, please | Goa I will not oppose His Majesty's Order in Council. ^ 1 must make an exception in the caap of C uae ca .se or tnese 'employed' ^ Kuwait Subjects, however, as I think that if any c.se arise one of these 'employed' Kuwait subjects and another Kuwait suoject it should be decided by me as both = ^ , s joLh are my subjects, and most Kuwait decisions follow Li e ■?«, • hugeous Law of Isia^.

Usual Ending ouer x\ T o.36o dated the 1st November 19^5 from the Political Agent, Kuwait, to H # 3, the Shaikh of Kuwait, After compliments. With reference to Your Excellency's letter of yesterday's date, I regret, that ay letter No.34-j da'ted the ^4th October 1 J '' aa noh 'lear to Your jixcellency, and that, eaen after jur conversation ai on Wednesday evening,Your Excellency still seeras to entertain some doubts as to the real objects of the Order in Council which has been issued. I am accordingly repeating the main points in other words, and I hope thajs by doing ao I will remove these doubts. In tne urst place I wish to make it perfectly clear that tue powers conferred on me by this Order in Council do not extend to the subjects of any Ituslim Government, such as i ersi^ns, .lajdis, etc., all of whom are considered for the pur pose of jurisdiction as the same as Your Excellency's own subjects. The only Foreigners with whom I am in any way concerned are tne subjects and protected persons of Non-Muslim Govern- ■aents, such as America, France, Italy, Portugal, etc,, ^nd in their case, if anytheir case, if any quebtion should arise, I am sure Your , Excellency would prefer that it should be dealt with by representative of His Majesty's Governuient rather than by | yourself. To reiterate: the powers conferred on rae do extend to:- va} British subjects and protected persons. ( j ) Tae subjects and protected persons of non-Muslim Foreign G-overnraents. (o) Kuwait subjects, or the subjects of other Kuellra Govern- meats, registered In my office as. being regularly employed by British subjects, or the subjects of non-Muslim Foreign Governments. Such people must, I am sure you will agree, be considered as under the protection of His Majesty's GovernmenJ It Is laid down In the Order In Oouncll, however, that If a .■luwalo subject desires to Institute a complaint a 0 ainst a 3rlt,lsh subject, or the subject of a non-Muslim Foreign jwer, I uri.1 either decide tne Cc;se in my own court, or, if , I ootn are !!uslims and a^ree, have the case referred to the iadnl xor iecision. Similarly If British subject^ or the aub- jecu 01 a 'on-:'uslis Foreign Government complains against a x Kuwait subject, I shall ask Your Sxcellency to decide the case, and its is specially provided that employed Kuwait sub- „eoLs snail oe dealt with in the same way as other Kuwait subjects in this respect. In cases in which Kuwait subjects mid e.iiployed' Kuwait subjects are concerned, however,as the latter are under British protection for the time being,! think you will agree that they have to have the same privi leges in this respect as other British suojects, and,as shown aoove, they lose no priveleges as Kuwait subjects. I think the above will remove the doubts from your mind and show you that the Order in Council will not injure the rights of anyone, and I shall be grateful if you win let me know if this Is ao.
