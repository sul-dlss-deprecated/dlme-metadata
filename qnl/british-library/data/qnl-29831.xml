To The Hon*ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Camp Bahrain. Sir, I have the honour to inform you that His Highness the Sultan has saught my assistance in obtaining admission into the Mental Hospital at Yerarda, Poona for his uncle Saiyid Ali bin Faisal. Saiyid Ali bin Faisal has been mentally afflicted for some time and is, I am informed by the Agency Sub-Assistant Surgeon, in a certifiable condition. He is not violent and the Muscat Government would be prepared to arrange for his journey with a suitable attendant to the Hospital and for his maintenance while there. Saiyid Ali bin Faisal has been living in a very modest way and is in receipt of an income of about Rs. 160 a month. 3. As Saiyid Ali bin Faisal is not a British Indian subject I believe that the sanction of the Government of India will be necessary before he can be admitted to the Hospital. If this is so then I request that steps be taken to obtain the necessary san ction. I suggest that if sanction is accorded details regarding admission and fees be settled by direct correspondence between my self and the Superintendent of the Hospital.

I have the honour to refer to your letter No. 335/2, dated the 12th September, 1942, and to acknowledge receipt of the sum of Rs. 603 forwarded therewith. 2. I have to point out that in your letter No. 42/2, dated the 22nd February, 1942, the pay of Saiyid Ali’s servant; was quoted by you at Rs. 30/- per mensem. This information was communicated to the Hospital Authorities at the time of Saiyid Ali’s admittance in the r v j Hospital. In my letter No. C/357, dated the 8th April, 1942, forwarding a bill for charges for March and April, the pay of the servant was drawn at this rate. Since no communication was made to me earlier, the Hospital Authoritiei have disbursed his pay at Rs. 30/- per mensem, and this amount will have to be remitted to them. I am now informing the Hospital Authorities that Saiyid Ali’s attendant should in future be paid Rs. 15/- per mensem. X\ 3. I have to refer to paragraph No. 4 of my letter No. C/1024, dated the 25th August, 1942, and further to point out that under their rules the Hospital Authorities require the charges being remitted to them in advance, i.e. charges for September to be paid to me for remittance to them in the beginning of Septem ber, and I shall be gratefulif you will kindly arrange to have this done in future. 4. Will you please let me have the balance Mof Rs. 225/3 as early as possible, as the Hospital Authorities are pressing for early payment.
