Bin Subah equipped his troops and alarmed the tribesmen residing in the vicinity of kuwait and determined to fight them. Ha then advanced to a place called Ciaryah and declared war against mys subjects. I have informed your Honour in order that you may communicate with the Oivil Commissioner in Mesopotamia and ask him to 1st me know whether Bin Subah is under the pro- tection of the High British Government or not. If he is then- I request that his transgression and pointless intrigues may be stopped. If he is not i.e. if he is independent, I request I may be informed; my object is only to prevent any incident which may cause displeasure. I had requested you to stop him (ttalem) from his goings on but he i is determined to con tinue in his evil desires. Shaikh Salem ordered the despatch of troops under the Command of Dafj As-Subah, these arrived together with tribesmen who were with him, at ^Al-Hamdh* a place &gt; in mydominions and outside the boundaries of Kuwait. The inhabitants of Qaryah begged their kinsmen viz., Mutair for help and on the advance of Bin Subah there was a skirmish and subsequently occurred the trouble: This news displeased our hearts and this is their being attacked and consequently fleeing away. I desire to inform your Honour and to state that if Bin Subah has any complaint great or small, he should refer it to me, and I shall communicate with the High British Govern ment and ask them to decide between us giving due Justice to' to 9«.oh oida.

Dickson, Political Agent, Bahrain. After Compliments, I beg to inform you regarding the real news of the Mutair and Ibn Subah. Firstly regarding Qaryah (Garaiyat or Jariyah). This place is the 'dirah' and camping ground of the Dushan, (family of Faisal, al Dawaish) and the Mutair from old times, and now it is inhabited by part of the Mutair who formerly used to inhabit Al-Hatawi^ah but who left because of some local ill-f*eling among them. When Bin Saud entered Hasa recently the Mutair came and asked him to give them 'Qaryah w , this he did: The place is not within the borders of Bin % Subah, whose boundaries are known to itart from Al-Sutaihiyah or even further northwards. After the Mutair encamped (under ibn Shqair) at Qaryah, Bin Subah sent them a party on camels; but without , letters. This party said to Ibn Shaqair the headman,'leave at once or we will attack you.' Ibn Shaqair replied that Bin Subah was not Mi his Chief but that Bin Saud was, and that he would refer the matter to bin for orders. Bin Subah, on hearing this reply from the leader of his party * was furious and declared war against the whole tribe of Mutair,and K definitely sent them a message as follows: 'You Mutair are my enemiet He then issued a prohibition against the export of any grains or ■t*&gt;| other commodities to Bin Saud^ people, as you have already heard. Bin Subah next sent for his men and cousin DaiJ and told them to take action against the Mutair and march on to the people of Qaryah. Dai J apparently was the instigator and planner of this move. # Hext DhaiJ marched off and encamjpd at Al-Wafra and again further advanced to Al-Jahal* From this place he proceeded to Naqair where he sent for the tribes of Al-Awazim, Al-Rishaidah and cetain of the Mutair who had long ago settled within the borders of Kuwait. When they arrived he ordered them to Join his force as he intended attacking the settlers at Qaryah. To this they replied^we will neither listen to you, nor obey you because we are.Bin Saud's enhlftrstw and inhabitants of Qaryah are sub jests of Bin Saudani Imvd dons no hArm. uittr however th«y agreed to naroh and at&amp;rtjd southwards* When aln a»haqair heard this news he at onoe sent for his klnsnen asking tneir help as he was afraid of ain tfubah for reasons tfut his women af;d ohlldreil were with him. He sent a message also to Bin 8aud who wrote and s oraered him not to proceed north of qaryah, and that should any one come and attack them at i4aryah they should resist by force N of arns* The ne^t move in the act was that sin Jiubah's forces camped at Hamdh about five hours distant from ^arjah and to the southeast of it. From there UhaiJ sent out a patrol which met a *iutair patrol from ^aryah* Theri? was a fight - The news having reached the respective Headquarter (Dhaij and ibn »hqair) reinforcements were urgently called for. These coming up joined battle with each other. We now know that Bin ©ubah was defeated although we do not know actually what were the casual ties on both sides• As regards the people of Mejd all were sorry to hear the news,and extremely indignant to hear of tHa action of Hin «ubah. They also infumed uin gaud of this misdeed and he replied telling them that the question did not concern them. How the Imam Abdul Aziz has written asking me to inform your Honour and to put two questions •If 3ln oubah is under the protection of the High British Government, then the matter can be settled between him and Bin flubah through His UaJsstjr's Government, if on the other hand Bin *ubah is an independent ruler then he would like to deal direct with him.* The truth of the whole matter is that Bin Saud and the inhabitants of Mejd have nothing against sin tfubah and the people of Auwait, on thai contrary they have affection for them, and in like manner the people of au»ait like Bin Saud and the inhabitants of Kejd. Since however Salim Bin *ubah became Shaikh ho has adopted a etrangely contrary policy towards jln gaud which is not hidden from you. din Saud has besn exercising patience for thi sake of &gt;our Government no doubt all Government officials are awars of this change of attitude.

Shaikh Saliia claims as his southern frontier the line defined in Article 7 of the Anglo-Turlcish Asreenesnt of 29th. July &lt;90, and it is very largely on this aGreenent that he bases his claiia. Tills line it will be renenberod runs from Kafar in the Batin, tlirouQh Safali, Qara*, Ilaba ^aTacf Mta* to the Persian Gulf oabal Manlfah, and its distance from Kuwait to to as the crow varies from 160 to Oi) miles, • ^ pears tliat tills boundary was fixed very largely on information obtained by Captain Shaliespear in his tours and ^-bodied in a Mote ( No. 0-52, dated the 12th.

Ke points out/uz points out that it ia aa definite and definable as any line nhioh one can expect to Tind in a desert, owlnc to tlae scarcity of wells to the south it is a strong one, and ail the points were un questionably within the Jurisdiction of Shaikh Mubarak. He suias up nost aptly by saying:- 'All Arab shaikhs base the territorial extent of their power upon their ability to enforce some order over the ^.djaccait tribes, their :x&gt;wer to enforce the payment of !! aikat !: by Bedouin, and their capacity to prevent and to avonG© outraoes and raids within the territorial Units olained.

This is no VjOttbt chiefly due to tlie general trend of events - e,^, the adoption of Ikhwanian by the r.!utair has naturally re-oriented then towards Riyadli ~, but also, in part, to Shaikh Salim' • parciraoneous netliod of dealing with tlie tribes# The fact remains tliat he has not the authority that his father had and that, according to the standard mentioned in para. 3, Ibn Uc * ' ir * 3 a ver y valid claim to the southern portion of the territory allott-d to Kuwait in the Anglo-»urkish Agreement of 19^3 In Ibn Sa J ud appears to base his claim on the unwritten ^aw of the desert, while Shaikh Salim bases his on a t/ould a civilised state. The question of whose claim we would prefer to see satisfied or whose, if either^, we should support would seem to depend largely upon our general policy for Arabia as a whole. From a local point of view, however, the follow ing points appear worthy of consideration:- (a).- ibn Sa'ud is better able to control the tribes in, at any rato 9 the southern part of the territory under dispute than is a Gnd should be recognised as ruler of it # It iay be arcued that the Anelo-Turkloh Acreenent of t?l3waf» clraim up to protect tia© interests of Ku'^ait acainst af^reg- intep^erenoe on the part of Turkey , and that as Turkey has o eased to be a politioal factor in this part of the vjorld, the uhola aorseaent has ipso facto bacone null and void. (c),- On tne otner hand, local opinion attaches very £^peat iaportanoe to tlie ^. aot that by the An^lo -Turkish A^y^eement of 19'^ ^e did recognise the frontier in question, and to repudiate It now would undoubtedly be looked upon as a breach of faith and a si^n of weakness on our part, and would still nore increase the dislike in which we are at present held by the Kuwait people. xbn will no doubt argue that Shaikh Ilubarak was a strong man and Shaikh Salia is a weak, and that a frontier which was suitable or the former is not so for the latter, but, logical as the argument is, he really refuted it himself beforehand by •loping the treaty with us on 26th # December I915, as by Clause 0 I we not only recognise him as the independent ruler and absolute chief of the tribes of Ilajd, Hasa, qatif and Jubail and their lependencies and territories, but also 'after him his sons and aescendents', and obviously some of his descendents may be weaker than himself, v®)-- It v/ould seem desirable to have as large a buffer state as possible between Mesopotamia and the central government of the I1 ^ waxi &gt; and for this reason, if for no other, it might be to our advantage to give our moral support to Shaikh Salim. boundary dispute between Ibn Sa'ud and Shai3ih Salln oeen a constant source of friction between them ever since the oalbul incident in February 19^9, and I see no prospect of their coming to an agreement without our assistance and arbitra* txon« To prevent further incidents similar to the fray near Jariyah on ICth.

Firstly, you should remind Shaikh Koweit arbitrary Anglo-Turkish Convention 19 13 was not a docurnnt to which he was a party and in any case was enacted under different cir cumstances at a time when Turks were in the Gulf. My opinion is that so far as he is concerned its provisions must be re garded as having been suspended by clause 6 of our Agreement with Bin Saud of December 26th 19 15. Official Territorial limits of Koweit territories remain to be determined. ■ Secondly, my advice to Shaikh of Koweit is to reply politely declining to sign paper invoking friendly arbitration and simultaneously agreeing to take no further action at JARIYAH pending such arbitration, result of dissimulation in my opin ion likely to restrict his territorial area (to) less than that given in Anglo-Turkish Convention, but this need not be told him. Thirdly, on receipt of a request from Shaikh Salim acquaint ( asking) for our good offices in this matter, I am prepared with previous sanction of His -Majesty f s Government, to address Bin Saud (jn subject and if poseible arrange settle-;! ment of mattery principal plenipotentiaries.

I have received your letter fated the 2\at m June and its supplement. frota Nasir as-Sa f ud, and have understood TThat you mean. Regarding Dawish's attack, you say that you had not wished it to happen, 'but that when it did happen you were not sorry for certain reasons hidden in your heart which you explain in your letter and its supplement, I do not see any reason for 'brinGing in all these events and writing this lon ^s explanation; if I am to slv® reasons and you are to do the samej the explanation will 'become long; and protracted. What happened in the past 'between us is not hidden 5 but every thins is clear. There was no senf ® of oblisation 'between us, as we were formerly as it were one 'body, and, please God, are now, I never mentioned the question of 'boundaries and subjects in ray letter which I sent you at the hand of 'Abdullah as-Sumait and •Abdul 9 Aziz al-Hasan as this is perfectly clear; ay subjects are well known, and ny frontier was fixed by the two Q-overnments and I hold papers to prove it, I informed you through my envoys regarding the disgraceful deed which Dawish and his followers had done, and requested you that the 'halal' should be returned and restitution made for the men who had been unjustly killed, as I felt sure that, in view of our friendship and union, a deed like this would disploaae you even more than it did me, and I am sorry to see that you oppose what I ask by putting forward these excuaes and false talea, I am sure that the reason you resist the Just claim which I have against you for what Dawisli has don® is that you have been listening to the lies of envious people who have been trying to cause ill will between us, You say that if I do not accept your terms and sigA the paper, I must excuse you from making resti tution, My brother, I am surprised at your saying thl«, and can hardly believe it, as it is Just what would please our enemies. The question of our aubjects and boundaries is understood, and P-^eace :lod, I shall do no thin,; to harm or di spinas you, butdisplease you 'but shall guard our friendship and union. But I have strong reasons to put forward regarding what Dawish and his followers have done, and I have done what was right towards you, and ray condition towards you ia known, so there is no need for long explanations over such an unworthy event; as the proverb says 'it is bad to think over the past'. Regarding the signing of the paper; I Gust ask you to think the matter over carefully, and I an sure you will see the right and benefit of regaining as we were in the past. I trust you will abandon the tilings which annoy ae and please our enemies, and, please God, you will only see a good result which will please you. Vfith reference to Dawish, as I told wou before, I can not take action against hia without letting you know, as he is of no izaportanoe, though# by the grace of G-od, X could in every way # I have received the caaels, riding canel and horse, which you sent with the envoys, and I trust that you will now order the return of the rest of the property, I hope you will not nak® any objection to this, as it is a thing for which I can not hold you excused.

I am directed to inform Your Excellency firstly, that His Lfajesty's Government greatly appreciate the statsa manlike manner in which Your Excellency has approached the question and are honoured at being aslred to decide the dis pute between you. Secondly I am directed to inform Your Excellency that Sheikh Salem has also agreed to His Majes ty s Government acting as arbitrators^ in the matter^. The above being so, and in order that the things may be made quite clear before-hand, and that no' mis-under standings may arise later. Sir Arnold Tilson K.O.I.E. has instructed me to inform Your Excellency that he agrees to appoint an arbitrator, early next autumn, to decide on all territorial questions affecting yourself and Ibn Sabah provided that Your Excellency undertakes before-hand to abide by the following conditions (1) That Your Excellency will accept for your life-time both on your behalf and on behalf of your people, the final the arbitrator decision of appointed by His Majesty's Govt. (2) That I'our Excellency will state In writing now,as ^ prili-minary to negotiations, exactly what Your Excellency considers to be the correct boundary line between your dominions and those of Koweit, mentioning, where possible, actual landmarks, such as the names of wells, hills, grazingt 1 grounds etc, and whether auoh fall within your boundary or are considered to be equally shared by both Bin Sabah and Your Excellency. this It will be necessary also in furnishing fcfcia inform ation that Your Excellency states as far ?fcs possible the grounds on v/hich you base your clams. (3) That Your Excellency will undertake that until the dispute is finally settled by Ris Majesty^ Government no hostile or aggressive acts shall be committed against the territories of people of Bin Sabah by any of Your Excellen cy^ troops of tribsemen. This always provided that Your Excellency is not the victim of an improvished attack from the other party. For Your Excellency^ information, I am directed to say that Sheikh Salem has been asked to comply with exactly similar conditions as the abovementioned. Your Excellency will therefore understand that it is to your interest not in any way to delo^y answering this communication or delay in accepting the conditions of His Majesty 1 s Government lest, the impression be created that Your Excellency was * perhaps not whole-hearted when Your Excellency requested that His Majesty^ Government should settle tfes your dispute.

About 1st :jopteinber a Koweit pearling boat, Nakhuda t one /vbaidan ( this corresponds with the nane of your nan) carae into Jubail to get water, with many other pearling boats. The snring from which fresh water is drawn is in the soa ( we have several such in Bahrein). Whilst a crowd of boats were all trying to get water atonce a fracas arose between Abaidan and the crew of another pearling boat, both of whom wanted to be the first to draw water. In the scrimmage that followed several on both sides were wounded and Abaidan the Nakhuda was killed by a rifle shot. Abaidan though resident in Koweit is a subject of Bin laud. The question of 'pirates* never came in at all, and the fracas, though happening at a soring actually in the sea off Jubail, is similar to 'rows' which not infrequently take place at wells in the desert. Jubail people are, at the best of it, rough Jedouins, not far removed from desert-men. I donot think the incident neel be looked upon as any thing more than accident.

He deawnded that Shaikh Salin should put down all smoking, drlnk- SAmbliag and prostitution in Kuwait, Shaikh Salim replied that he too disapproved of all these things, and that he was quite billing to prohibit their being done openly by his subjects.

The question of the camels f * loot then csl &amp; g up, Shaikh Salim agreeing not to interfere Wiu:l tho Ikhwan if they left everything which they had taken. The on the other hand, maintaining that as they had taken it in 411 had a perfect right to take it with theme He eventually aaia thsj+ u no -t authorised to agree to Shaikh Salia's demand himselfl.dH f '■ ?i 1 iQ ii 111 r 1: iilfyii ' h : [ ll: jjlaself, tout that ha would discuss the matter with Dawlsh. He tti«n withdrew and went off towards Da wish's teat, which was to the north -wftst of th® villag®. (The orisinal report that the Ifciwan Mi' Jjjll agreed to return Uieir booty Is untru®). Shortly after this th« Ildiwan moved off, taking everything with thorn, and without any further fighting. They aarchod three hours that day and halted, and tii« following day iaov©d an to Subalhiyah, where they still are» On the 14th October Dawlsh sent in a letter to Shaikh Salia aflking that Kilal al-Mutairl, now one of the biggest aerchants in Kuwait, should do sent out to 3ubaihiyah to treat with hia regarding a settieaient of the dispute. The Shaikh refused and replied that if Dawiah wanted to discuss anything with hia, he should send one of tha Dushan faiaily into Kuwait, The aessenger who brought this letter was a Kuwait slave, who was captured at Haradh, near Jariyah, in May and was given his life on condition that he joined the Ikhwan, It is difficult to fora an accurate estimate of the nuaber of \ Ikhwan involved. From the early reports received in Kuwait I put the nuaber at about I4CQ, but after personally visiting Jahrah and ieeing the dead on th© ground and the graves of those buried, I see that there aust have been far acre, and think there cannot have bean less than 3000. I estimate their killed alone at 600. Shaikh Salim and others who were present put their nuaber at 4Q00, usually saying that there were four bairaq s. with a thousand aen to each. The aessenger, referred to above, stated while in Kuwait that they originally nuabered 4000, of whoa between 700 and 600 were killed Jahrah and over dOO severely wounded, of which latter quite half 'Ued before they reached Subaihiyah. On reaching Subaihiyah their active strength was not more than 1500, but they found 300 ro- inforceaents awaiting them there, and had subsequently been joined by more. These latt®r, camel riders, he described as coaing Da3 ^ 'froa the north'l The Kuwait force is said to have only lost about 2qo killed, ver y 1&gt; ®w of whoa were actual inhabitants of Kuwait. This small \ ^^aaer in coaparison with the Ikhwan 1 s losses, is iue to the j.acw that the Ikhwan attacked across the open in masses and snored uiie utt®r disregard for their om safety. ** 1 i T i iy iOn the idth October Dawish sent in envoys to Kuwait to dis cus i terras for a settlenont of the dispute. In accordance with tne ordinary custom, they were given tiiae to rest before stating their mission, and Bhaikh Salia had not seen then by the evenlno of idth October. Their terms, however, are known, and are totally liapossible for him to accept, being in fact a demand that Shaikh Salia and the people of Kuwait should become Ikhwan forthwith, and that from now onwards they should be friends to their friends and fo®s uO their 1053, D«,wish apparently says he can accept no other terms himself, and, as he puts it, he cannot thread a needle without Ibn Sa^d 1 # approval.

I myself warned Salim that forces and his war-flag at JAHRA were merely an incitement to Akhwan, that he had much better demobilize and depend on our pacific intervention but he did not see things in the same light. I am not prepared to encourarre friction between parties by advising SALIM to re-oooupy JAHRA with a force. If ha does so it must be on his own risk as before.

Issues covered in this file include Ibn Sa‘ūd's boycott of the port of Kuwait in favour of the ports on the Eastern coast of Arabia; raids on Kuwait by the Ikhwān Movement (folios 6-14); relations between Ibn Rashīd, Ibn Sa‘ūd and the Āl Ṣabāḥ family of Kuwait; and defining the boundaries of Kuwait via-à-vis the territories held by Ibn Sa‘ūd (folios 41-44, 109 and 124).The latter part of the file (folio 126 onwards) concerns the Battle of al-Jahrā’ in October 1920, when the Ikhwan Movement, under the leadership of Fayṣal al-Dawīsh, laid siege to the Red Fort (Qaṣr al-Aḥmar) in the town of al-Jahrā’, Kuwait. There is correspondence concerning the extent to which Ibn Sa‘ūd had control over Fayṣal al-Dawīsh and the Ikhwan forces (folio 148); copies of Arabic letters (with translations) between Ibn Sa‘ūd and Fayṣal al-Dawīsh (folios 246-263); and correspondence detailing British intervention on the basis of
                           Anglo-Kuwaiti Treatyof 1899, including the provision of military assistance by sea and air (folios 160-63 and 170-71).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000306#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
