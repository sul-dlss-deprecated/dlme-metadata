Similar letter sent to: .admiraltyCopy of letter from Ur, J. ’/all dated Riyadh November 1939, addressed to His Majesty's Minister, Jedda. 10th. I have the honour to refer to my telegrams Nos. 30 and 31 of November 8th. and 10th. concerning Oheikh Yusuf Yasin's conversation with me on November 7th. about the three islands, Pasht al Jarim, Khor Fasht and Chaschus (or Shaskus), and to give below the substance of his remarks which he has now embodied in an aide-memoire handed to me today. The Saudi Arabian Government have received information that the Bahrein Oil Company has sent a technical party to explore the three following places: 1. Pasht al Jarim, which is 30 kilometres from Manamah (Bahrein) and 30 also from the Saudi coast, 2. Khor Fasht, which is 20 kilometres from Bahrein and 19 from the Saudi coast, 3. Jazirat Chaschus (or Shaskus) which is 35 kilometres from Bahrein and 8 from the Saudi coast. In view of the friendship existing between the Saudi Arabian Government and Bahrein, and between the Saudi Arabian Government and H. M. Government, the Saudi Arabian Government did not wish any dispute to occur between the two parties over any question of frontiers, territories and positions. For this reason this question should be settled in an amicable way. The Saudi Arabian Government had previously referred to the British Government in the matter of Al-Labina island, but no decision had yet been reached. The Saudi Arabian Government did not wish to claim anything belonging to Bahrein and they relieved that Bahrein did not wish to claim anything belonging to them. But he, Yusuf Yasin, wished to record that the Saudi Arabian Governmort could hot agree to the Bahrein Oil Company operating in areas o^ which no decision had been taken by the two countries. The Saudi Arabian Government wished to settle the matter in accordance with international Law and with the agreement between them and Bahrein. He would observe that the sea between Saudi Arabia and Bahrein could almost be considered water and not international because it was unfit for inter national navigation and was no thoroughfare for anyone, and, in a general way, it was imp ssible for these waters to serve for international navigation because of the great number of reefs and areas of shallow ’ 2 * * * * 7 ater. It was his opinion that, if possible, there should be a division of the waters between the Saudi Arabian Government and Bahrein. 2. . . . I asked Sheikh Yusuf if the matter had been discussed with Bahrein and he replied that they had discussed it with no one except His Majesty's Government (meaning, I presumed, in this conversation). I then asked whether the Saudi Arabian Government had any idea of the procedure they wished to adopt for reaching a settlement; had they in mind, for instance, the setting up of a commission to study the matter. He replied that the Saudi Arabian Government wished to settle it but he had no particular suggestions as to how it should be settled. The Saudi Arabian Government hoped to have the opinion of His Majesty’s Government on the matter.Z' © Copy of Cir :i. Bullard’s Telegram of November 26th. 1939. sent to Captain de Gaury, Riyadh. You may inform Ibn Baud that His Majesty’s Government are anxious that the status of the various islands and reefs lying between Bahrein and the mainland should not give rise to difficulties and they would suggest that a Saudi i-.rabian representative should be sent to Bahrein to examine position on the spot with British Agent.3479 15099 (4) No. f'* o CONFIDENT! \* Kuwait Recrtf i «« - C ] Jf.

British Legation Jedda. No. 48 ay Gth, 1940 (1043/560/2) My Lord, The Italiein monthly review ’’Oriente : ode mo a published in October last a list of the ,, IlcIlwan' , settlements or 'colonies' which had been established in various parts of Nejd, and which were mentioned in the press reports of the tribal meeting which took place at Riyadh in August 1939# The Italian paper’s report gave the impression that the Ikhwan movement was still of great political importance in this country. Mr# de Gaury, however, went through the list of settlements and made certain comments which may interest Your Lordship’s department, and I now have the honour to submit a short note on the present position of the Ikhwan movement in the light of Mr. de Gaury 1 s report and such other information as is available. I must however confess that accurate information from Arab sources on this subject is almost impossible to obtain. 2. It will be remembered that the religious settlements of the 'lkhwan ,f (brethren) date from 1912. A general description of their character and objects is given in 'Field Notes on' Saudi Arabia', 1935, pages 32 and 33. The original idea was to establish agricultural settlements throughout the various tribal areas, peopled by the more fanatical elements of Wahhabi Arabs, in order not only to break up the existing nomad and tribal organisation for the benefit of the state, but to retain the services of the fanatics and divert them from raids into Iraq and Kuweit, forming them by degrees into the nucleus of a territorial and national army. Mr# Philby’s book 'The Heart of Arabia', published in 1922, contains many reference to Ikhwan settlements and to the hopes which were then cherished as to their national,non-tribal, usefulness* 3. Mr. de Gaury, however, now informs me that in the opinion of many Arabs with whom he talked recently at Riyadh the Ikhwan move, lent is dead. Appendix IV, page 130, of 'Field Notes' draws attention to the gradual lowering of the strict religious standards which had been the boast of the first settlers in 'Ikhwan' communities. It appears that this deterioration of religious zeal has gone on at an increasing rate. Such settlements as remain are no longer purely religious colonics: the increasing tide of pros icrity and security against tribal raids lias resulted in a good deal of tribal settlement, and the Ikhwan colonies have become merged into, and swallowed up by, tribal settlements which have little or no connexion with strict Wahhabi tenets. In some cases Mr. de Gaury knew from personal experience that settlements mentioned in the lists no longer exist at all: for example, the colon y called 'Ureira' in t ,e Ajnan tribal territory, which never had more than about four houses, is now completely deserted. The tendency towards tribal settlement is well shown by such schemes as the agricultural development at Kharj, about which a separate report has been submitted. I have, etc. (Sgd.) F.H.W.

His ighness also mentioned this matter of Bin Sand's concern to me, and Philby has written to Dickson to whom I am indebted for some of the following; Philby says that Bin Saud is mery gloomy, and that nothing will cheer him up. The situation in ifrance has caused him worry, but now that there appears to he no immediate Question in Syria he may he a little relieved. Bin aud's real trouble is in Nejd, and he has had to cancel the usual half-yearly gathering of tribal chiefs to receive subsidies at Myadh, and this year has told them to stay in their encampments stating that there is no grazing at Myadh, and also that there is a shortage of water and food. He has promised to send their stibsidies to them. As a sop to these chiefs he has told them all that they may export from Kuwait thirty camel loads of goods of any kind they like duty free. This is a big concession. 3. You will see, therefore, that the situation in Nejd is bad, and that the reports are not just idle chatter. His Highness expressed himself pleased at Bin Saul's discomfiture for he thought that if his hands were full looking after his own tribes, he would not concern himself with Kuwait. This gloating may be natural, but It does not show any appreciation of the situation. ?or it/ The Hon'ble Lieut-Colonel O.O.Prlor, CXS., Political Besident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.•2- &amp; it is possible, though not liJcely, that Bin Sand may turn his attention all the more olosely to Kuwait to ensure the continuance of a source of supply, now vital owing to difficulties in using the Hed Sea ports. 4 . However, Bin Baud and his tribes are not my concern, but what I wished to point out was that Bin Saud # s attitude towards us must these days depend a good deal on the regular plying of the Gulf slew-mail. Any serious interruption in this service is bound to have far reaching repercussions in the northern desert of Saudi Arabia, and these will be attributed to us. As it is prices have soared, and it is a good thing that there is no '^assiauss* about, for empty stomaches must be fertile ground for propaganda. 5. X hear that stocks are so high in India that the authorities are having difficulty in disposing of them, and have sent Trade Commissioners to South America, and X suggest that a channel worth exploring would be to do something in this line in Saudi Arabia# I aia naturally ignorant in such matters, but it occurs to me that there is now a possibility of making a move to gain Mn Saud f s further good will while benefiting Indian trade.
