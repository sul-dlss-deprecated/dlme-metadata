This sculpture depicts a so-called vulture cap: the bird&rsquo;s oval body sits at the top of the wearer&rsquo;s head and its outspread wings sweep down beside the face. The vulture&rsquo;s tail is indicated in back, but its head has been replaced by a royal <i>uraeus</i>-cobra over the forehead. A queen would have worn such a headdress on top of a voluminous wig. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe head shows some of the Middle Kingdom influence that is so pronounced in early Eighteenth Dynasty art under Ahmose and Amunhotep I. Other details&mdash;such as the shapes of the eyes and eyebrows&mdash;indicate that the head was carved later, to represent either the wife of King Thutmose III or his mother, Queen Isis.<br />", "summary": "", "rank": 0, "label_date": "2016-03-01", "date_added": "2016-04-04 19:33:54", "approved_for_web": 1}], "artists": [], "collections": [{"id": 5, "name": "Egyptian, Classical, Ancient Near Eastern Art", "folder": "egyptian", "rank": 0}], "exhibitions": [{"id": 648, "title": "Egypt Reborn: Art for Eternity"}, {"id": 1199, "title": "Realm of Marvels: Building Collections for the Future"}, {"id": 3329, "title": "Ancient Egyptian Art"}], "related_items": [], "geographical_locations": [{"id": 6863634, "name": "Egypt", "type": "Place made"}], "videos": [], "images": [{"filename": "CUR.65.134.3_erg456.jpg", "id": 81220, "standard_size_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size2/CUR.65.134.3_erg456.jpg", "thumbnail_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size0_sq/CUR.65.134.3_erg456.jpg", "derivatives": [{"size": "0", "width": 72, "height": 96}, {"size": "1", "width": 144, "height": 192}, {"size": "2", "width": 288, "height": 384}, {"size": "3", "width": 576, "height": 768}, {"size": "4", "width": 1068, "height": 1424}], "largest_derivative_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size4/CUR.65.134.3_erg456.jpg", "largest_derivative": "4", "description": null, "caption": " <em>Head of a Queen</em>, ca. 1479-1425 B.C.E.
