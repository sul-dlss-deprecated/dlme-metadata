A previous foliation sequence, which is also circled, has been superseded and therefore crossed out.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The volume contains correspondence and memoranda relating to the affairs of the Aden Protectorate. The correspondence is mostly between the Political Residency in Aden, the Government of Bombay, the Government of India, the India Office, and the Foreign Office. There are many enclosures to the correspondence, often in the form of printed series of related papers. This includes translations of correspondence to and from tribal leaders.The papers cover the discussion over, and conclusion of, treaty relations with several tribes and sections of tribes in the Aden Hinterland. This was largely brought about by the delineation of the border with Ottoman Turkish territory and the need to secure support from the tribes of this region.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent, Dthala</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Aden</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Aden</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Yemen</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Colonial administration</topic></subject><subject><topic>Frontiers</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000365.0x0003a0#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
