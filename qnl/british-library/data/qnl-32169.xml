C n the 15th Kovenber last (83rel Ahan, 1514} a certain Salim Bin ’Ahdullah, saill^ his boat the Fateh el Khair, left Ras el Khaim ah, of which Sheikhdom he i© a suhjf^ct, for Sirri Island with a load of woo* which he proposed to sell there. He was in possession of a travel permit issue*, by Sheikh Sultan Mn Halim, Sheikh of Has al Khaimoh and his boat flew the faeimi flag. 5. Three days later the Fateh al Khair reached Sirri and the Firewood vaa sold to one Saif bin Hfbaid, a native of Sirri. On the following day, November 19th, (Aban 27th), while Salim was away f om his boat in an other part of the island, a certain ’Ubald bln Khalfan, a native of the island, and a party of about forty other inimbitante beaciusd Salim’s /boat.fcoat, dismantled it and took the sails and gear to ’ifbaid’s house* Salim was only allov/ed to keep hi© money and his personal belongings from the boat* 4 . When Salim remonstrated with ■ Ubaid and his party he was told tiiat their action was in retaliation for some previous action of tne Sheikh of Has al Khaimah. I am reliably inforraeu that Salim then appealed to the Iranian Director of Oust oias on the island# who had witnessed the whole incident, but that the latter took no steps to inter vene* Salim was consequently forced to leave his own boat behind and to borrow a boat for hi© return journey to Has al Khaimah* 5 # There would seem to be no justification whatever for 1 llb&amp;id bin Khalfon and his friends acting in the above manner, and X feel sure that Your Excellency will take the view that it is the duty of the Iranian officials stationed on the island to pi'esent such things from occurring* The ineid nt# in which it seems that over forty persons were implicated# is of same importance, and I have the honour to ask Your Ixcellency 1 © iissistance in obtaining reparation for the victim* I would venture also to express the view that, in addition to securing the /returnreturn of his property&gt; Salim is justly entitled to some compensation from the culprits. 6 . Your Excellency will appreciate that it is my duty, in making this request to state at the same time that it should not he regarded as constitut ing an admission hy His Majesty’s Government of the Iranian claim to de jure sovereignty over Sirri Island. The request arises from a recognition of the ue facto occupation of the island hy the Iranian Customs author ities.

When Salim remonstrated with HJbaid and his party he was informed that they had acted in retaliation for a prerious alleged act of aggression committed by Shaikh Sultan of Ras al / Subject! Seizure of Has al Kh&amp;imah dhow at SIRRI ISLAND. Sir, X have the honour to report the following incident. On the 15th November last one Salim bin ’Abdullah sailing his boat - the B'ateh al Khair, left Has al Khaimah of which Shaikh- dom he is © subject, for Birri Island, with a load of wood which he proposed to sell there. He was in passes si n of a travel permit issued by Shaikh Sultan bin &gt;alim» Ruler of as al hairaah, and the Fateh al Khair flew the ^asimi flag. 2. On the 18th November the Fateh al Khair reached Sirrl Island and the firewood was sold to one Saif bin *Ubaid, a native of Sirri. ; n the following day, while Salim was away from his boat in another part of the Island, one ’Hbaid bin Khalfan, a native of the Island and a party of some 40 other natives, beached Salim*s boat, dismantled it, and took its sails and gear to ’TIbaid’s house. Salim was allowed to take charge of his personal belongings and money from the b Oat • ■' •*n- 2 - al Kh&amp;imah, whose subject Salim was. Salim appealed to the Iranian Director of Customs on Sirri Island who had witnessed the whole incident. The latter, however, either could not or would not intervene on behalf of Salim, who was forced to borrow a boat from Saif bin ’Ubaid for hie return journey to Ras al Khaimah, leaving his own boat behind. I have the details of the grievance of *ubaid and his party against the Shaikh but I need not trouble you with it at length since, whether it is real or imaginary, it in no way affects the somewhat serious point at issue (see paragraph 4 belowj. One point however in this dispute between ’Ubaid and Shaikh Sultan is of some little importance. The reason of the dispute between the two parties was a certain debt which a subject of the Shaikh claimed against ’Ubaid and which the latter refused to pay up the last s. 1000 /-. xhe Shaikh, the date is not stated but presumably it was fairly recently, sent his representative to I 4 ngah to represent the claim before some official of the Iranian Government. This latter official deputed his representative to go to Sirri Island together with the representative of the Shaikh to settle the matter, and an agreement was reached that 1 Ubaid should pay part of tii•ft ialence in full settlement of the claim. ’Ubaid paid part of tbei balance btrt refused to pay the whole and pressure was brought to bear on him by the representative of the Shaikh, which resulted in a settlement of the claim. It was in revenge for this pressure that *Ubaid took his action in seizing Salim’s boat. 4. Moat of the Inhabitants of Sirri Island are Arabs connected with the Trucial Coast and such quarrels between Arabs do not normally concern us. In this case, however, the dispute is complicated by the fact that the Iranian Government /Government are in de facto possession of the Island, though we have never acknowledged their position de lure (vide correspondence end ng with paragraph^ of yoar predecessor^ Note No*b26 t dated the 21st November iy31, to the Persian Minister for foreign Affairs, forwarded to me under Tehran Printed letter No.234 xf 21st November 1931). If we permit the Island to remain in the possession of the Iranian Govern ment the least the latter can do is to prevent incidents of the nature reported &amp;b &gt;ve recurring. As you will see the representative of the Director of Customs on Girri Island did nothing to help Calim and what adds to the responsibility of the Iranian Government is that - vide paragraph 3 above - the arrangement come to as to the debt between * Ubaid and the subject of the Shaikh of as al /haimah was made uncier Iranian authority. 5. The Shaikh of as al ilhaimah has not unnaturally sent in a very strong protest to me, hinting that if we cannot obtain redress for him he will be unable to prevent his people 1 taking the law into their own hands. 1 should think that this eventuality is far from unlikely. I venture to suggest therefore that the Iranian Government should be urged to arrange for the return of the boat and for some compensation to be paid by the culprits to S&amp;lim. In the meantime with a view to keeping the Ghaikh and his people from taking retaliatory action I am informing him that I have reported the matter to you for representation to the Iranian Government. 6 . You will notice that tfie incident occurred ©n the 15th November. The delay in reporting it has been inevitable since things move slowly 0 n the Trucial Coast, and after the first report had been received the important point had to be confirmed /A (g) -4- &gt; confirmed aa to whether there was an Iranian representative on the Island when the incident occurred* I am sending a copy of this letter to His Majesty's Seeret&amp;ry of State for India, the Government of Iniia and the Political .Agent, Bahrain.

BRITISH LSGATIOF, TEHRAN. November 21st, 1931. Monsieur le Ministre, I have the honour to inform Your Highness that HisFajesty’s Surveying Ship 'Ormonde' will continue during the forthcoming winter months the hydrographic survey of the steamer track through the Persian Gulf which was undertaken but not completed in 1929 and 1930. 2. On this previous visit, the Persian Government afforded valuable assistance by allowing parties to land at various points and I have received instructions to enquire whether landings will now be authorised on the islands of arur, Kais, Hindarabi and Sheikh Shuaib and also on the island of Sirri, such landings being of importance as ensuring the accuracy of the work, and thus increasing the safety for navigation in the Gulf. I would ask Your Highness to be so good as to cause the necessary instructions to be issued to the local authorities to ensure that all due assistance may be afforded to His Majesty’s Ship 'Ormonde' which it is proposed shall operate from Henjam. 3. It is perhaps my duty to add the observation thst the mention of the island of Sirri should not be regarded as constituting an admission of the Persian claim/ummmemmmm claim to de jure sovereignty but merely a recognition of the material fact that it is in the occupation of Persian Customs officials whose foreknowledge of the proposed visit is desirable in order to exclude the possibility of any mi sunderstarriirg. I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to Your Highness the assurance of my highest consideration.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0001a3_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/3851</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0001a3</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/3851</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 30/122 'Persian claim to the island of Sirri'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1936/1937</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-07-28T22:25:26</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (29 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 31; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.

The incident produced a protest by the British Legation, Tehran to the Iranian Minister of Foreign Affairs, in which the British Government, while acknowledging Iran's de facto occupation of the island, denied any acceptance of Iran's de jure sovereignty there. In response, the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs asserted both Iran's de facto and de jure sovereignty. The correspondence shows that following this, the Foreign Office decided against reiterating the British position in regard to sovereignty over the island. The issue of the boat that had been seized was amicably settled (folio 6).The file also contains copies of earlier correspondence dated November-December 1931.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year.
