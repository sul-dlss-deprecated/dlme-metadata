It consists entirely of printed minutes of meetings of the conference, most of which are chaired by George Curzon.Those attending include senior representatives of the Foreign Office, the India Office (most notably the Secretary of State for India), the War Office, the Admiralty, the Air Ministry, and the Treasury (including the Chancellor of the Exchequer). Other notable figures attending include Harry St John Bridger Philby and Gertrude Margaret Lowthian Bell.The meetings concern British policy in the Middle East, and mainly cover the following geographical areas: Mesopotamia, Kurdistan, Trans-Caspia, Trans-Caucasia, the Caspian Sea, Palestine, Persia, Hejaz, and Afghanistan. Some of the meetings also touch on matters beyond the Middle East (e.g. wireless telegraphy in Tibet, ff 79-80).Recurring topics of discussion include railways (chiefly in relation to Mesopotamia), Bolshevik influence in the Middle East (particularly in Persia and Trans-Caspia), and relations between King Hussein [Ḥusayn bin ‘Alī al-Hāshimī] and Ibn Saud [‘Abd al-‘Azīz bin ‘Abd al-Raḥmān bin Fayṣal Āl Sa‘ūd].Several sets of minutes also contain related memoranda as appendices.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Interdepartmental Conference on Middle Eastern Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author; subject</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Meetings</topic></subject><subject><geographic>Middle East</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Bolshevism</topic></subject><subject><topic>Railways</topic></subject><subject><topic>Foreign policy</topic></subject><subject><topic>Colonial administration</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000001491.0x0002a9#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
