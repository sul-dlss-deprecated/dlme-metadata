No. C/449 Dated the 14th Hay 1941. I had a talk with Shaikh Salman yesterday morning and suggested that In view of the amount of unemployment and distress in the town it might be a good thing to start some food distribution centres for those who have no means of subsistence. He seemed In entire agreement and said he would mention It to his father and discuss the matter with you. If he does, I think that money spent on such relief at a time like this would be well spent, and might avert any possibility of disturbances. Yours sincerely, l C.

The Adviser to the Bahrain (iovernment, Bahrain. Memorandum I understand that there has been during recent months an increase in the number of thefts and burglaries reported to the police. It seems to me that this indicates that a subs tantial decline has taken place in the economic welfare of the community. If the figures are readily available I should be grateful if I could be sent a comparative statement showing the number of such cases reported to the police d_uring recent months compared with the corres ponding period three or four years ago.

Memorandum:- 'Vith reference to your memorandum No.C/316 dated 6th March 1943, I enclose a statement showing the number of cases of thefts and burglaries dealt with by the Police during the last four months and the same four months a year ago. You will see that recently there has been a very serious increase in crimes of this type. In the last four months there were 94 cases as against 51 a year before. The majority of recent cases have been petty thefts committed generally by youths and small boys, in many of the cases which I have had before me in the court the offenders were children. They usually steal such things as food, including date stones which are used as fodder, matches, empty wooden boxes which are left behind shops, old iron from garages and in the villages they take chickens. In addition to these offences there have been some more serious cases in which older men, tempted by the enormously kiw-h high prices, have stolen motor tyres, motor batteries and spare parts but most of the cases at present consist of petty thieving. A number of foreigners with criminal records who were well known to the police have been repatriated to their countries and I shall shortly apply for the repatriation of several more notorious characters^ some of the regular offenders are in jail and since these men have been safely put out of the way there have been less big robberies but juvenile crime is increasing.*( 3 &gt; It is a disturbing indication of the present condi tions that for some months swarms of small boys, some of them as young as five or six years old, creep into Manama in the early mornings from villages which in some cases are several miles away in order to pick up what they can by lawful or unlawful means. If they can earn an anna or two by carrying the shopping baskets of foreigners or well to do Arabs they buy food with it,if they fail to find a job they hang round the shops and markets and steal what they can. This is quite a new development in Bahrain and it is difficult to cope with it. In the past, when cases of this type were infrequent, a few strokes with a cane in the court was an effective deterrent but today this punishment or even public beatings in the Suk al Arbaa, which have lately been inflicted on a number of young thieves, seem to have small effect. There is no reformatory in Bahrain and it is most undesirable to confine young boys in the common jail. In many caseawhen these boys are arrested and when they appear in court they say that they are starving and beg to be sent to jail where at all events they will be well fed. Their appearance sub stantiates their excuses. All that is possible is being done by the Police to reduce this and other types of thieving but owing to the deteriorating economic condition of the people, particularly in the villages, thieving, especially of food, is increasing. It is scarcely surprising that families consisting of four or five persons with perhaps one wage earner who receives at the. most Ks.25/- a month find it difficult or almost impossible to support themselves when the cost of all staple foods has increased to such a great extent. Unfortunately, apart from the permanent employees of the Bahrain Petroleum Company, there is very lit ole -work being done in Bahrain which requires ordinary coolie labour. Neither the 3/—3 Government tj or private enterprise aMO undertaking any big works and there are still several months to go before the diving season starts. Normally during this part of the year a great deal of building is done as well as rec lamation of land whici provides employment but now all such work has ceased. Adviser to the Government. Unci S.Z.r\ No. ~ 1362 Office of the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain Dated, 4th R/Awal, 1362 March 11, 1943. H. B. M’s Political Agent, Bahrain. Memorandum:- The State Medical Officer has recently reported to me that an increasingly large number of patients come to the hospital suffering from extreme debilitation caused by malnutrition whose only cure is food, tonic and rest. This bears out the fact that many people in Bahrain today are in a state bordering upon starvation not because food is unavailable but because owing to the high cost of living Vrsey have not the money to buy food. A few days ago I discussed the matter with His Highne Shaikh Salman and Shaikh Abdulla. His Highness is rravely converned over the growing state of want in the country which seems likely to become more serious as the war goes on. His Highness fears that the position here might even tually resemble the state of things on the Persian coast. He desired me to acquaint you with the position and to obtain your views on means of improving it. I suggest that perhaps it would be advisable to have a discussion on the matter in the near future. Adviser to the Government . S.Z.5/- belief of gconomic distress In Bahrain* On 20th March 1943 I discussed with I'r• Belgrave the questisn of relief of economic distress in Bahrain* 2* We agreed that if pearling operations could he encouraged this season a great deal of unemployment would he relieved. To facilitate pearling operations two things are required (a) an adequate supply of dates and cereals by the end of April when the pearling fleet purchases its provision^; and (b) that dates and cereals should be made available at A reasonable price. This, however, is a question which is being tdken up separately. 3. There are two alternative ways of reducing economic dis tress, but these alternatives are not mutually exclusive* 4. The first way is to reduce the price of essential food stuffs. We cannot interfere with the price of rice since (i) it is owned by merchants and (ii) it is in very short supply. No useful purpose would be served by the Bahrain Government taking over the rice from the merchants and putting it on tc the market at a reduced price as it would all be exhaust ed within a month and there is no prospect of getting fresh supplies of rice. The question of reducing the price of dates was also considered. The difficulty in the case of dates is that, if the selling price in Bahrain is fixed at a rate which will enable poor people to buy them easily, the rate fixed must necessarily be substantially below the cost price of dates; and this would entail a complete stoppage ©f private date imports from Iraq by merchants - a consequence which would be most ^ } unfortunate. (There would, however, be less objection to i . ^ having a ,, pool ,, of dates for sale to the pearling fleet at - it a reduced price. This would not interfere s© much with the general trade of date merchants with the public). The question of reducing the cost of flour was also considered, but the diffi culties are:- (a) we do not yet know the cost price of the 400 tons of Australian flour from 3.3. M Orion T, ^and (b) the flour is of very fine quality and it will be wiser to keep it for mixing with barley or millet which we hope to get subsequently from Iraq. The only essential commodity left is wheat and the position in respect of this is, 1 think, more promising. The 6000 odd bags of wheat now in stock is owned by the Bahrain Government and not by the merchants. It has cost the Bahrain Government only about Rs 17/- per bag while the present selling price of wheat (as.11 ps.6 per rub*) is based on a cost price of about Rs 30/- per bag. A further 535 tons of wheat is expected from Australia the cost price of which will not, it is hoped, exceed Rs 20/- per bag. Moreover 1090 tons of wheat from India is earmarked for Bahrain the price of which ought not to exceed Rs 22/- or 23/- per bag. (In respect of wheat the Bahrain Government have Rs 8627/- in hand being the profit from the sale of the Canadian wheat. A certain amount of Australian^ wheat has also - presumably - been sold at a substantial profit). In these circumstances Mr. Belgrave and I agreed that it would be possible to reduce with immediate effect the selling price of wheat to as. 8 per ruba, based on a price of Rs 20/- per bag of 181 lbs.gross. It was also agreed that persons desiring to purchase wheat in place of their ration of the more expensive flour (as.12 ps.3 per ruba) or rice (Rs 1-3-0 per ruba) should be allowed to do so. Only poor people would take full advantage of this concession and this measure would increase the con sumption of wheat, of which v/e have good stocks in sight, at the expense of rice and flour of which our stocks are extremely exiguous.5* The second measure of relief discussed related to the undertaking by the Bahrain Government of a public works programme in distressed areas* On the previous day 1 had discussed the problem of economic distress with Mansur al Arayth, a leader of the Shia community. He pointed out that cheap grain was not of much use to people who were totally unemployed* Mansur al Arayth suggested that fresh land should be brought under culti vation by the digging of wells at Sanad, Qarze Khan or Radmal Khori (at the latter place there is a stream whose water could be used if a pump were installed)• He also informed me that the most distressed areas v/ere in the*.neighbourhood of Sinabitt, Budeya, Suq al Khamis, Zellaq and Jau. 6. The Adviser confirmed that these areas were bad ones and promised to examine possible public works projects (especially the construction of roads) expenditure on which would go almost entirely to labour and hardly at all to the costs of material* The whole subject is to be discussed with His Highness the Shaikh very shortly* 7* Dr. Snow is considering the problem of help in the form of food to patients who come to the hospital suffering from debility caused by semi-starvation* The difficulty of making special provision for such cases is that the number of persons applying for admission to the hospital would increase to pro portions which it would not be possible to cope with* 8* Mr. Wakelin is disturbed about the declining physical health of boys in the schools at Budeya, Suq al Khamis and Sitra (a total of about 250 boys is involved)• We discussed a sugges tion that all these boys should be given a free meal in the middle of every day consisting of bread and a few dates, l am strongly in favour of such a scheme, the organization of which Mr. Wakelin will arrange (if it is approved by the Bahrain Government) on his return from Kuwait. 1 pointed out to Mr* Wakelin that free meals at schools in certain areas would make other areas very jealous* 1 also pointed out that every parent in the island would want his or her children to attend one of the three schools in order thati the child should obtain free meal. Mr. Wakelin seemed to think that these objections could be overcome* 9* The present ration scale is Rice 8 lbs. per head per month Wheat 6 lbs• Flour 6 lbs * Sugar 4 lbs. u u Since March 20th people can exchange their rice or flour ration for wheat.

Memorandum: - As an indication of present day conditions you may he interested to know that I have a letter from the Secretary of the Moharraq Municipality pointing out that in the last 4 months over Es. 1,000/- has been spent by the Municipality in providing winding sheets for pauper burials in Moharraq and in villages on Moharraq island. In the past the Municipalities have undertaken the burial cost of paupers, after examining each case, but in normal times the annual cost has not exceeded about Rs.1,000/-. The reasons put forward by the Municipality to account for the abnormal increase under this heading are more paupers, more deaths and dearer winding sheets. I have written to the Sunni and Shia Kadis asking whether under present circumstances there can be some relaxation in the rule which lays down the number of yards for a male or female corpse.

The second measure of relief discussed related to the undertaking by the Bahrain Government of a public works programme in distressed areas. On the previous day I had discussed the problem of economic distress with Mansur al Ariyadh, a leader of the Ghia community. He pointed out that cheap grain was not of much use to I ' people who were totally unemployed. Mansur al Ariyadh suggested that fresh land should be brought under cultivation by the digging of wells at Sanad, Gar ze ?han ©r Radmal Khori (at the latter place there is a streamwhose water could be used if a pump were installed;. He also informed me that the most distressed/areas were in the neighbourhood of Sinabis, Budeya, Suq al Khamis, Zellaq and Jau. 6. The Adviser confirmed that these areas were bad ones and promised to examine possible public works projects (tepacially the construction of roads) expenditure on which would go almost entirely to labour and hardly at all to the costs of material. The whole subject is to be discussed with His Highness the Shaikh very shortly. 7. Dr. Snow is considering the problem of help in the form of food to patients who come to the hospital suffering from debility caused by semi-starvation. The difficulty of making special provision for such cases is that the number of persons applying for admission to the hospital would increase to proportions which it would not be possible to cope with. 8. Mr. Wakelin is rid r&gt;tT P^nabout the declining physical health of boys in the schools at Hudeya, Suq al Khamis and Sitra (a total of about 250 boys is involved). We discussed a suggestion that all these boys should be given a free meal in the middle of every day consisting of bread* and a few i dates. I am strongly in favour of such a scheme, the organization of which Mr. Wakelin will arrange (if it is approved by the Bahrain Government; on his returnfbom Kuwait. I pointed out to Mr. Wakelin that free meals at schools in certain areas would make other areas very jealous. 1 also pointed out that every parent in the island would want his or her children to attend one of the three schools in order that the child should obtain free meal. Mr.Wakelin seemed to think that these objections could be overcome. 9.
