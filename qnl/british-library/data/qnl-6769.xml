(Received at India Ollice as enclosures in Aden Residency covering letter No. C.-695, dated 23rd September 1915.) Iroin Major-General Sir George Younghusband, K.C.I.E., C.B., Political Resident, Aden, to The Secretary to Government of Bombay, Political Department. No. C 094. Aden Residency, Sh\ I0th/23rd September J915 1 beg to forward two very interesting Notes by Lieutenant-Colonel H. Jacob, first Assistant Resident, on the Italian question in so far as it affects Arabia and the general settling up, in Southern and Western Arabia, after the War. 2- My own acquaintance with these parts is only very recent and of short duration, and, therefore, any remarks I make are put forward with much diffidence. 3. 1 here appears to be in some quarters in England a suspicion, hardly a jealousy, of Italy and Italian influence in the Red Sea. It is thought to be undermining and supplanting British influence. With that view I cannot lind myself in agreement. 1. In the first place Italy knows her weakness in these regions as com pared to England, and she knows that every tribe on either shore is also fully aware of the fact. Her manifest interest, therefore, is to work hand in glove with England and not against her. With England’s benevolent assistance she can do much, without it she is powerless. 5. Now England’s policy has been to encourage and assist weak Powers, and to keep strong ones at arm’s length. We can therefore do with complacency for Italy what it would be very injudicious to do for France or Russia. We should I think earn her lasting gratitude, by taking her fully into our confidence and asking her to share with us the burden of settling the knotty problem that will remain to be solved on the Arabian coast after the War. 0. 1 was much interested to meet Colonel Bodrero and hear his opinion regarding the fighting value of the Arabs enlisted in the Aden Protectorate and its neighbourhood. If an Italian officer can make successful soldiers of these men, much more so can the British officer, for that way does his genius lie. The present seems to be a very favourable moment to try the experiment. 7. A commencement might be made by raising say 2&lt;M) Arabs of the best fighting tribes, mounted on camels and trained as fighting scouts. The political effect would be excellent and according to Colonel Bodrero the corps would be of undoubted fighting value. It so happens that at the present moment a very suitable officer for raising such a corps belongs to the Aden garrison, Major \\ . J. Ottley, 23rd Sikh Pioneers, whose services would be made available for this purpose. I have, &amp;c., G. J. Yolnohl sband, Major-General, The Secretary to Government, Political Resident and General Political Department, Bombay. Officer Commanding, Aden.z Enclosure Xo. 1. Memorandum on the employment by Italians at Mogadiscio of Askaris from Arabia. 1 had an interview on 4th September 1915 with Colonel Bodrero of the Italian Benadir Colonial Service. He lias been training the Arab levies we allowed him to enlist from this country. He gets them from our own pro tectorate and also from the Turkish side. This recruiting is of long standing, though suspended, during the iurco-Italian war. 1 hough originally enlisted for the Benadir only, the men have been sent from time to Time to Tripoli, where they have been most successful lighters against the Turks and the Senussi. Colonel Bodrero tells me the men are splendid under fire, and in his opinion superior to the Abissinians, aniiIi whom he worked for several years at Asmara. The Italians have taken some 6,000 Askaris from this source. Colonel Bodrero was surprised to hear we did not recruit local battalions in Aden. Their pay in Mogadiscio at the coast is lis. 12 only, from this sum they provide' their own clothes. They get no rations unless they go up country to clear the jungles preparatory to motor traffic, by which the countrv in hinterland is gradually being opened up. After two y ear^ service the men are permitted to return home, but those who elect to stay behind, and are of good character, are encouraged to engage m petty trade-, and are liable to be called up as a reserve, drawing in that event Rs. 3 per mensem. a . . . . .. The men take women from Somali tribes, f heir wives are necessarily left in Arabia. Colonel Bodrero takes personal mteiest m his nu n, and mixes freely with them. He tells me that nothing is of avail with Arabs save the personal factor, and if any of Ins officers aie high-handed, he dis misses them summarily without further inquiry, as otherwise his system of paternal rule would be wrecked. . I gathered from him that the discipline exacted is not yen ngid. he lash is forbidden. 41 W e do not use it, said Colonel Bodreio, as you do (sic) I have questioned many of these returning Askaris, and they are pleased with Italian methods. The Italian officer is more in touch with his men than we are, and 1 have seen an officer in Abyssinia exchange his helmet for a Galla soldier’s “ sombrero,” which he thought insufficient for the other under a strong sun. _ . - As an instance of Colonel Bodrero s popularity, prayers v\eie oueied foi him in the local mosque when he left the other day to take up his appointment as Officer Commanding 12th Bersaglieri now fighting against Austria in the Alps. . , . , , Colonel Bodrero said he knew no Arabic, and though he admired the linguistic attainment of British officers, he found that it yvas bettei to induce men to understand Italian, as that increased Italian prestige. Xo time 'was wasted in ceremonial parades. Musketry yvas carefully attended to, but the Colonel had no mind for such things as kit inspection, which he thought a waste of time and purely spectacular ! I gathered that uniform yvas not 44 de rigueur. ” I he men are armed with magazine i dles. I asked him what arrangements were being made to convert the Benadir roadsteads into harbours. He said nothing yvas attempted, and then saicas- tically added “ if the place was considered really productive, Government would certainly abandon her colonial enterprise there! ” I o-ive these feyv extracts from our conversation to show yvhat has often been before reported of the way Italy is imparting, in subtle foim, her influence in Arabia, i.e., the gradual “Italisation” of many Arabs both sides of the line whom we are virtually neglecting. We remember-her attempts a feyv years back to deal directly with the Sultan ol She hr and Mo Kalla and get installed a Marconi system at the latter place ; and there is, again, the assertion bv one of her Prize Court Judges, during her wai with I ui -wcv, that a dhow carrying the Arab flag was to all intents and purposes a 1 urkish dhow since no recognised Arab hegemony existed ! Her Consuls here for some time past coquetted yvith the Imam of Sanaa and lor many yeais anItalian merchant was living in Sanaa and was able to make commercial deals for that Ruler which won his confidence. 1 believe that Italy’s connection with the Idrisi was severed after the conclusion of peace with Turkey, but 1 know that during our pourparlers of recent date an Arab was despatched from Massowah to Sabia to see the Idrisi, who, although he professes at this junction supreme contempt for the Italians, remembers thar country’s liberality qua guns and ammunition when he was a coadjutor v. the Turks. The Idrisi still hankers after Italian guns to which his men are accustomed, though it is true that, so far as we know, he prefers to make his requisition for them through us. Were Italy able to get a footing along the Red Sea Arabian littoral, her role as an arbiter in Islamic matters would be unquestioned and her position across the water in Abyssinia would be consolidated. If we do not wish to extend our influence materially as well as morally in Arabia, we can hardly object to Italy's programme, but 1 think the times demand new measures. There can never be an “ Independent Arabia.” The idea is unthinkable. The net result would be chaos and confusion worse confounded. The Turkish rule in the Yemen though bad, inspired fear, and on their retreat from these scenes, bloodshed and rapine will increase. We cannot suffer anarchy across, and contiguous to, our protected borders. I therefore attach a memorandum on our present policy and trust that my connection with this tract since 1897 may be sufficient excuse for my hazarding a few suggestions. II. F. Jacob, Lieut.-Colonel, Aden, First Assistant Resident, Aden. 8th September 1915.Enclosure No. 2. Memorandum on the Political Policy of our Hinterland. In the event of Turkey’s dismemberment and her retirement from the Yemen the present political aspect will necessarily undergo a radical change. In the first place, the Imam of Sanaa will shift his headquarters south wards. He detests the Turk but cannot dispense with Turkish largesse to such Arab mercenaries of his as the “ Hash id wa Bakil,” who can only be kept loyal to the Imam by large monthly doles. These doles the Imam cannot, and would not, give from his own purse, as he is avaricious and stingy. Again, as told me by one of the Imam’s lieutenants quite recently, the Imam will not permit Turkish troops entirely to leave Sanaa for they are an outward and visible sign of Turkish power retained to overawe these contumacious tribesmen and further to collect the Imam’s revenues. The Imam was very displeased to see the Turkish occupation of Lahej, which he considers his special preserve. The Imam had a secret treaty of offence and defence with Sultan Sir Ahmed Fadl whom he treated as his own creation. Further, the Imam was averse to our bombardment of Sheikh Said, which he said was a part of his ancient possessions, and he had aspirations towards regaining his ascendancy in this part. On the disappearance of the Turks from the Yemen the Imam will undoubtedly try to come down into their relinquished possessions and we shall be confronted with a very troublesome, because an ambitious, ruler, whom it will be hard to placate. The Imam is clearly master of the Upper Yemen when the Turks removed their military headquarters to Taiz. He will continue to intrigue with our north-eastern border tribesmen. He has approached the Ruler of Marib and won him over to his side. Sheikh Abdul Rahman of Marib is a Zaidi, like the Imam, but he has been trying to approach us also to acquire a stipend. The Arabs of our hinterland are almost entirely of the Shafai persuasion, and will resent the Imam's approach, but it should be remembered that they were formerly Zaidis, and their chieftains acted in the role of Imam’s viceroys. From what I know of the Arab it would not be impossible for them to side with so powerful an aggressor if they saw us holding back. For this reason it will be hard for us to disown our existing treaties. At the same time these treaties are very non-committal. They may be summed up broadly into two heads: An agreement on the part of the Arabs (1) to abstain from ceding their territories to other Powers ; and (2) to allow free access to their countries. The first clause the Arab will abide by since by that way money comes to him. As regards the free access into their territories the idea is farcical. They are free to enter Aden, and they receive presents and entertainment, but if we attempted to pay a friendly visit to their countries every Arab Sheikh would scent our ulterior motive and suspect annexation. We should be met with opposition. The Arab loves a “ Paula ” (tlovernment) to whom he can go for money, but otherwise he prefers our room to our company, and would be left alone. This isolation is due partly to their geographical position, and because we have so little— save for a few years on the Dala plateau—tried to make ourselves intimately known to them. Their blood-feuds, too, set them apart, one tribe from another, and amongst themselves alliances are formed only to be broken. There are means of breaking down this reserve, and to that I shall come presently. Then there is the Idrisi Saiyid of Sabia. His present action was supposed to be directed against the Turks, but he will fall foul of the Imam whose borders are contiguous. They once were friends, but the Imam’s change of front towards the Turks before their war with Italy, and his adhesion to the cause of Islam against the Infidel estranged the Idrisi, who charged his rival of acting without prior reference to himself, and hence the chasm now existing between them. Here was a case of two Arab chiefs of opposite religious beliefs being friendly one with another, and it lends colour to myassertion that the blending of Zaidi (Shia) with Shafai (Sunni) is not altogether chimerical. A transfusion of prejudices is possible at any rate. \\ e shall have our hands full after the war with Turkey, reconciling the conflicting interests of Imam and Idrisi, especially as the latter is now bent upon enlarging his territories at Turkish expense, and this will claim tracts which, with the departure of the Turks, the Imam would himself like to take over. We have stated in our Treaty with the Idrisi that we did not wish to acquire any fresh tract of land in South W r est of Arabia. Looking, however, to the I ui kish encroachments across our border and their occupation of Lahej, our policy must be amended. Then, too, Ibn Nasir Mukbil—known as Mawia—has foiled us. He expected to be kept in his tract of Kumaira and Shurman under our aegis. He dislikes both Turks and Imam. His adhesion to the Turkish cause—the result, I believe, of “force majeure,’ and also some diffidence in his mind of our bona fides, since we did not move up to meet him at Dala—though not necessarily indicative of any hostile animus against us,—will put him into a difficult position with ourselves when peace is concluded. His country is very fertile and rich, as is also that of Hujariya to the south, which also Ibn Nasir MukbiTs influence pervades, and even so far south as Sheikh Said. 1 his count]y the Imam will covet. It should properly be ours in spite of our declared policy to hold aloof. The times have materially changed. The Idrisi’s representative asked the Resident in Aden why he did not take Sheikh Said, Mocha, and Hodeida, which he said “would further our joint cause,” and would certainly not be unpalatable to his master, in spite of our expressed reluctance to lake fresh territories. Lo come to our own stipendiaries. The Haushabi Sultan and the Azraki Sheikh have both joined the Turks at Lahej. The Haushabi, it is true, was compelled to join the enemy who marched down through his territories, but Sultan Ali Mani did not coniine himself to this action, but was a prime mover in the sacking of Lahej, where he took special delight in destroying his rival the Abdali Sultan’s property. The Haushabi has for years chafed under his position as a quasi-subordinate of the Abdali House and was glad of this opportunity of revenge. I do not think we should hereafter recognise him as a friend. I would suggest we should put’up a nominee and place the country directly under the Abdali Sultan, whose tribesmen, though not a fighting clan, did their utmost to stem the Turkish advance and who came back with us to Aden—their fortunes completely shattered. The Abdali’s loyalty is unassailable. The Arab cannot understand our retreat from Dala in 1907. His prophecies all hold that we must return one day to assume possession of the country. It is Allah’s will, and cannot long be delayed. The times are therefore propitious for us “ to lengthen our cords and strengthen our stakes.” \\ e do not by our present system of dealing with ruling Sheikhs and Sultans fall in with the genius of Arab hegemony. Everyone is as good as his fellow. “ Kullun Sheikh biladu,' i.e., everyone is chief of his own tract —they say, and this tract is narrowed down to mean the family unit. By giving stipends to the headmen we are paying monies to merely nominal rulers, and though each titular ruler has to allocate some quota to influential men of the tribe, who would otherwise render his position untenable, the rank and hie get practically nothing. The Arab is what Burton termed a pantisocrat, and owns no superior, and hence the frequent lootings to fill empty coffers and of blood feuds the result of penury. It is true we pay large sums of money annually qua Darbar presents and enter tainments in Aden, but even this distribution touches but the fringe of Arab society and leaves a smouldering resentment against us and the rulincr Sheikhs. The railway is the best means of combating this inequality of treat ment. The railroad would open up the country; give all and sundry a chance of disposing of their produce ; introduce commodities into Arabia and create wants now unknown. By it the country will be pacified and we shall extend our influence. By it the system of transit dues will perish.
