Ibn Sa’ud .—Having left the Mu’abda Palace at Mecca on Sunday, June 28, Ibn Sa’ud arrived at Riadh on Saturday July 4. It seems to have been a right royal removal and, incidentally, that is the way the money goes. An advance party in one hundred and fourteen box-cars and lorries carried the heavy baggage. More than sixty such cars are said to have been required for the silver dollars which the King is to popularise in Nejd, but this item of news need not be taken whole. Whatever the exact figures, they were enough vastly to impress the populace of Hejaz, Seven hundred motor vehicles in all is the estimate of the Indian Vice Consul, who was m Mecca shortly before the start, and they must have been needed; for with His Majesty went his brothers the Amir Muhammad, the Amir Abdullah, the Amir Ahmad, and the Amir Musa’id, together with all their households; his sons the Amirs Sa’d Fahad, Mansur, Abdullah, Bandar, Musa’id, Abdul Muhsin, Sultan, Mash’al, Abdurrahman, Mutiyib, and Talal; his nephew Khalid ibn Muhammad; and all the little Rashidis. His second son and Viceroy of the Hejaz, the Amir Faysal, accompanied him to A1 Maya, a two days’ journey, whence he returned to Mecca. His eldest son and Vicerov of Nejd, the Amir Sa’ud, with two more sons, the Amirs Muhammad and Khalid not to mention his cousins, came a two days’ journey to meet him at Marat and escorted him into Riadh. His reception there “our pen fails to describe”, concludes the editor of the “Umm-al-Qura”, who is generally a ready writer. 2. It should be added that Ibn Sa’ud did not singly travel en famila. He was accompanied by his Secretair and Chief of his political diwan, Sheykh Yusuf Yasin, all the officials of his royal diwan, two doctors, and the Tripolitan refugee Khalid Bey al Qarqini. He was followed by Mr. Philby and two mobile Marconi wireless sets. 3. The stay in Nejd is to last about six months. In the middle of August the “Umm-al-Qura” announced that the King was just then leav ing Riadh for a few weeks in the Hasa, but it appears that the troubles to North and South, referred to later, here kept him at Riadh, where he is in direct wireless commuication with Taif. If. rumour is to be believed, he has already made heavy demands on his Director-General of Finance for cash, amounting on one occasion to twenty thousand pounds, of which five thousand pounds were collected from one still wealthy Sheykh and the money-changers at Mecca. ' , 4. In the Hejaz it is,generally felt that the King, having concentrated his attention on Hejazi affairs for over a year (his first prolonged stay in this part of his dominions since his conquest of it in 1925), has left them in a hopelessness. It has even been suggested that he has run away from them. Undoubtedly he was tired, in all probability discouraged, and as likely as not looking for relief in his native Nejd, where there was also pos sibly some need to consolidate his position in person. His absence has left the Hejaz half of this kingdom like a water-logged and half-dismantled ship lacking any particular signs of a wind to blow it either into port or further on the rocks. It is hard to say who has been governing the country for the last two months. Probably the Director of Finance, since government seems to have reduced itself to withholding of all pay and salaries and a succes sion of attempts to raise the wind. 5. Ministry of Foreign Affairs .—The Amir Faysal moved the seat of “government” from Mecca to Taif on July 6th for the summer. He has continued to be a nonentity in both features of his double role as Viceroy and Minister for Foreign Affairs. His impartial love of women and boys is, from all accounts, undiminished. The Beduin falls to these luxuries of town life as an African to gin. L807(C)F«fcPD2 4 % &gt; 6. The Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs visited Jedda on July 6 for two days, on July 15 for the inside of the day, on July 25 for a day, and not again until August 31. On July 7, 8, and 15, His Majesty’s Minister had the opportunity of discussing current affairs before his departure on leave On July 27 Faud Bay contented himself with ringing up His Majes ty’s Charge d’Affaires, and having nothing special to say he returned to Taif. His visit of August 31 was unannounced but productive of a certain amount of discussion which falls to be dealt with in a later Report. 7. Finance .—The silver dollar (riyal) sank another point in July to fifteen to the pound sterling although still quoted officially as standing at ten. Some twenty thousand pounds worth of the nickel coinage (halalas) has been locked up in a room in Mecca and its withdrawal from circulation, in the form of a forced loan Jrorn the merchants, has served to maintain the value of the current remainder. 8. To Ibn Sa’ud’s request of June 17 for help from His Majesty’s Gov ernment to bring a British Bank into the country as a State Bank (May-June Report, paragraph 4), His Majesty’s Minister was instructed on July 14th to reply that His Majesty’s Government regretted that they were unable to depart from their long established practice of non-intervention in trans action between foreign Governments and British banks. Meantime, how ever, the King had empowered Sheykh Abdurrahman Qusaibi, who was visit ing England, to interview banking firms in London, thus anticipating the advice with which His Majesty’s Government had amplified their reply. As a result of the Hejazi Minister’s conversation at the Foreign Office, it was arranged that his Secretary should accompany the Sheykh to the Depart ment of Overseas Trade to discuss matters. They there stated that they were already in touch with the Eastern Bank and the Ottoman Bank. They were given an introduction to Barclays Bank. No success is known to have attended their efforts to present the matter as a business proposition. 9. Sheykh Abdurrahman seems, however, not to have been idle in Holland. Following up the appeal made in Jedda to the acting Dutch Chargd d’Affaires (May-June Report, paragraph 4), he appears to have made some headway in Amsterdam, for the manager of the “Dutch Bank” in Jedda—a branch of the Nederlanrische Hendel Nautschippij, informed His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at the end of August that his principals seemed to be seriously contemplating a loan of half a million sterling to Ibn Sa’ud, to be secured on customs receipts and conditional by suitable concessions in matters of the handling and control of all public moneys in the Hejaz. Mr. Jacobs regarded the purely economic and financial bases of such an arrange ment as sufficiently sound and cited custom figures for the Hejaz which ranged round the million mark (sterling) during the past three years. But the political future worried him profoundly and he was inclined to advise his principals that Ibn Sa’ud could not be relied upon to maintain peace and his own position for a further period sufficient to secure such a loan. 10. Meanwhile the Hejazi Government wer unable to get credit any where. The Dutch Bank would give none, pending the negotiations, nor would Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Company, Limited, with whom the Government had been unwilling 'to renew their former contract for shell ban- zine. The Director-General of Finance had therefore to look elsewhere for the fuel needed by Ibn Sa’ud and his Government. He entered into negotiations in July with the Soviet Legation for the supply of benzine on deferred terms of payment. The negotiations were long and tiresome, the Russians seeking to use the Government’s need of motor fuel as a lever where with to remove the existing embargo on all Russian goods (in spite of which a few goods do enter and are dutied four-fold). They failed in this en deavour but they nevertheless signed a benzine contract, probably in order to keep a foot in the part-open door to further negotiations. The terms of the contract are understood to be purchase by the Hejazi Government from Sojuenofti Export (Soviet Naphtha Export) of sixty thousand eight-gallon cases of benzine at six shillings and six pence a case, c.i.f., and forty thou sand eight-gallon cases of kerosene at five shillings and three pence a case c.i.f., the total cost of thirty thousand pounds to be paid in four equal in stalments at two-month intervals, the first on delivery. As an immediate A *3 .jirtH result and before there was even any definite news of the arrival of this fuel, the Director-General of Finance was able to make advance sales of benzine in Mecca for cash to the tune of two thousand pounds, at one pound sterling a case, a transaction which paid him handsomely. 11. Neither this nor money collected periodically from Hejazi mer chants “on loan” was used to reduce the Government’s indebtedness nor was much if any of it used to pay Government officials’ salaries which fell still further into arrear. The debt to Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Company Limited of some eight thousand pounds remains outstanding and will pro bably so remain until they can distrain on the receipts of the next pilgrimage season. The Post Office Department’s debt to the Eastern Telegraph Com pany continued to mount steadily since the last settlement up to the end of April and was something over two thousand pounds at the end of August. As for the thirty thousand pounds owed to the Government of India for arms supplied to Ibn’Saud to crush the Nejd Rebellion of 1929, the Hejazi Gov ernment’s appeal ad miscricordium was perforce allowed and they were informed in July that the Government of India had no alternative but to agree to still further postponed payment. The hope was expressen that Ibn Sa’ud would honour his pledge not later than March 5th 1932. A reply expressing the King’s thanks, but nothing more, was received in August. X2. Economic. —Mr. Twitchell’s report on the minerals of the Hejaz coastal area appeared in the “Umm-al-Qura’’ during July and August, whence it was re-translated back into English and sent home for such expert study as it might merit. To the layman it was disappointing. Some ancient gold workings at A1 Qaryat and some surface exphalt up and down the coast near Wejh appeared to be the only indications of mineral wealth of any possible value. More will be kown when Mr. Twitchell returns, as is expected, in October with six American prospectors. This factor at least would seem to show that there was more in his report or his further dis coveries than was published. The Swedish geological mission mentioned in the May-June Report (paragraph 9) appears to have been side-tracked. 13. As a result of Mr. Twitchell’s report and supposed high optimism, the exploitation of minerals began to assume attractive features in the eyes of the local inhabitants as a rich alternative to the exploitation of pilgrims. 14. Marconi Wireless Installation. —The Hejazi Government failed to pay the July and August instalments. There was also a series of delays in getting on with the work of installation. Two mobile sets followed Ibn Sa’ud to Riadh at the end of July, accompanied by Mr. Philby and the Egyptian engineer, and there they were used to maintain communication with the Hejaz, but no serious attempt was made to prepare the ground work for the big Riadh station and all the material continued to lie in Jedda. As for the station-to-be in Northern Hejaz and at J&amp;af, the Marconi expert, Mr. Boucicault, was unable to leave Jedda for Wejh until August, 2, and at the end of the month he was still at Wejh, unable to proceed to Tabuk, the site of the first station, for lack of benzine for his convoy. 15. Legislation. —The texts of measures governing the Shari’a Courts, the Hejazi Civil Service, and Commerce and commercial legislation were published during July and August. 16. Religious Intolerance .—July saw the re-constitution in Mecca of the dreaded Wahhabi Committee of Virtue. The easy-going Hejazis were beaten up to their five-a-day prayers by Nejdi soldiery placed at the Committee’s disposal. In the words of an eye-witness, the Indian Vice- Consul, “these incarnations of the devil widely run through the public thoroughfares and enter the lanes and bye-lanes in pursuit of the defaulters who might have taken shelter there, and on discovery fall upon them w T ith all their might and beat them mercilessly. There is no distinction between good or bad, rich or poor, young or old. They lay them down on the public road and flog them indiscriminately’’. There appears to be no escape for the Meccanis from these indignities, for whereas in the past offenders against the puritan Wahhabi code of prayerfulness and abstenance from tobacco were, X Sr-% given a chance to appear before a body of notables, among whom were citi zens who had a natural inclinaion to leniency towards their fellow-citizens 111 crime, all are now dealt with summarily by the Nejdis, who are distri buted in gangs of twenty throughout the thirteen quarters of Mecca. It is expected that this treatment will come oft‘ before pilgrims from other lands begin to arrive. 17 ' Tile Le o ation .received a long complaint in July from a prominent ohf a recounting the indignities heaped upon his sectaries in the Holy icf j - €S Another complaint in August concerned the closing of a school in Medina, of which the Nizam of Hyderabad is one of the patrons, for refusal to employ a Wahhabi teacher and to inculcate the Wahhabi concept ot the Unity of Allah. Neither complaint could of course be attended to without departing from His Majesty’s Government’s settled policy of neutrality in religious matters. II FRONTIER QUESTIONS. Trans-Jordan. t j 18 ' Ra l dl1 }9 --One Hejazi raid was reported in July by the Trans * ^70 haV1 r ng ] take ? T place on Ma y 5 &gt; when a party of Hejazi Amza raided the Trans-Jordan Nowayat, killed one man. and made off with some sixty camels. The usual protest was lodged. 19. In August a desert patrol of the Trans-Jordan Arab Legation re covered two camels and two rifles taken by the Trans-Jordan Tagatea from the Hejazi Bilh. These were held ready for collection at Madaswara («) and the Hejazi Government were notified. There was no other raiding during Police* 1 ^ AUSUS hankS Chlefly t0 the effioienc y *e Trans-Jordan Desert 9fi AU 9 luh , b Ih ^ Se ’J d Meetings, (a) Meeting of June 5.—Not until July jega ] tlon recelve from the Trans-Jordan authorities the parti^ and Sh/vk^’AM 1 ? 1 ^ 7 l le ! d 011 June 3 &gt; Captain Glubb and Sheykh Abdul Aziz Ibn Seyd (see May-June Report paragraph 26) lell Thffnlf cordlal . a . nd f rleildl y. each side entertaining the other to a meal.

He stated, however, that he had received a letter from Ibn Sa'ud saying that he hoped that powers to treat with the Trans-Jordan Govern ment Kepresentative would shortly be given. 21. This meeting, however, was only a preliminary one, designed to establish contact between the two frontier representatives. Their main meeting for the settlement of all matters connected with raids since August 1st 19JO were to follow. Meanwhile, on August 1 the Hejazi Under secretary offered to come to Jedda to discuss the preliminary meeting, but His Majesty’s Charge d’ Affaires replied that he thought that they could not advance matters by discussing what was merely an exchange of views at the preliminary meeting; and as the terms of reference of the main meet ing had already been settled after full discussion (see May-June Report paragraphs 26-27), he considered that it should be left to the two frontier representatives to carry on. Although not strictly wUthin the scope of this Report, it is convenient to mention here that Fuad Bay, in a senes of conversations held at Jedda on September 1 to 3, made another and more determined attempt to start a discussion of additional principles, by which the Glubb-Ibn Seyd meetings for the settlement of past raids should in his view be controlled. He was ridden off. 22. The Legation has been somewhat hampered by lack of concise and up-to-date information from Trans-Jordan about the passage of events which interest it closely. News of the preliminary meeting having taken place on June 3 was first received through the Hejazi Government. Inform ation as to its outcome was not received from Trans-Jordan until nearly two months later. The first main meeting was held on August 15 but the Legation was only apprised of the fact on September 1 and through Hejazi channels. Information from Trans-Jordan came to hand on September 15, in the form of report by Captain Glubb dated August 19. 23. (b) Meeting of August 15 .—There were separately two items on the agenda of the main meeting of August 15, (1) the return of loot taken since the 1st August 1930, an era which divided at the 1st Ramadhan (January 19) into two looting periods, the greater and the less, and (2) the settlement of future procedure. In regard to the first item, Ibn Seyd stated that he had not prepared a list, which rendered examination of the claims impossible, but Captain Glubb succeeded in securing his agreement to attempt an immediate restitution of the little loot taken since January. 19. In regard to the second item, Ibn Seyd was equally unprepared, having he said received no instructions to discuss future procedure. Captain Glubb raised two further matters, (3) the taxation of Trans-Jordan tribes men in Nejd territory, on which point Ibn Seyd replied hat he had implicit orders to tax, and (4) the “numerous protests” by the Hejazi Government against his, Captain Glubb’s, activities since his last meeting with Ibn Seyd. There seems to have been some misconception of the real position here, for only one protest was made, under three main heads, and it was made from Mecca on the same day as the meeting at Hashim Wells, June 3 (see May-June Report paragraph 29). So that when Ibn Seyd expressed to Captain Glubb his astonishment at “the continued despatch of such protests, in view of the fact that after their first meeting he had written at length to Ibn Sa’ud” to persuade him of Captain Glubb’s real merit, it seems that their feelings were being unnecessarily harrowed. 24. With regard to this first main meeting of August 15, it may be added for purposes of record that, whereas Fuad Bey informed ' His Majesty’s Minister on June 21 that instructions for the meeting had been sent to Ibn Seyd, adding that it would be better if Captain Glubb were to wait a few days before arranging the meeting so as to allow time for the L807(C)F&lt;feFD4 * 4 » » 6 instructions to arrive, it was not until the end of July that Captain Glubb leceived instructions to suggest to Ibn Seyd a date and place ior the meet- mg. He did so, but received a reply from Ibn Seyd that he had not yet received Ins instructions. About August 10 however the latter sent to say tha, he was ready and they met only to find that Ibn Seyd, as already men- tioned had neither lists of past raids nor instructions as to future procedure. Yet the Hejazi Under-Secretary has since categorically informed His Majesty s Charge d’ Affaires at Jedda (September 19) that Ibn Seyd was supplied in good time with a full list of claims. 25 The meeting of August 15 was the first fruit of His Maiestv’s Government s strong representations of February 26 to Ibn Saud, that Captnin Glubb and Ibn Seyd should meet to examine and settle past raids. Captain Glubb s opinion at the end of the meeting, however, was to the effect that, if His Majesty’s Government proposed to stand aside and urge Jffn ba ud and Ira ns-Jordan to arrange matters between them, there was not the least chance of Ibn SaTid returning a single animal. Captain Glubb also feared that if the matter of claims were pressed home at their th ^ 1 ° Il y outcome would b e an open rupture between himself ana JDn feeyd. ihere were no more meetings. , 26 - Preventive Measures against Raiding.—la a letter dated July 5 tuad Bey Hanza drew Sir A. Kyan’s attention to the supposed fact that Kk k ?u t Q pi f vent raldin g were only designed to last over the period of Glubb-Ibn Seyd meeting for the settlement of claims. He there- lore asked for His Majesty s Government’s views as to how to prevent raids While submitting the request to His Majesty’s Govern ment, Sir A. Ryan gave his personal views in conversation with Fuad Bev on July 7. He reminded him that it had been agreed after a definite e A^ a n S k °k f T7 S t 7 t th ® Proclamations of Ibn Sa’ud and the Amir . ^I f, 1 s ‘! oul , d a P p !y t0 all raiding at all times and not merely during the Glubb-Ibn Seyd meeting. He recognised of course that proclamations alone would not stop raiding. That must be effected by the measures taken on both sides of the frontier and their co-ordination by co-operation between local authorities, as contemplated in Article 5 of the Hadda Agreement As regards measures the position was that last October His Majesty’s Gov- ernment had fully informed the Hejazi Government of what was being done on the Trans-Jordan side. I hey had, however, received no similar state ment from the Hejazi Government. The best means of preventing future nmtual knowledge of the measures taken on each fide and (i) collaboration in accordance with the Hadda Agreement. These views were endorsed by His Majesty’s Government and confirmed to Fuad Fllv bv His Majesty s Charge d’ Affaires on August 10. There was no reactinb in the direction of either (1) or (2) above. mere was no reaction 21 Raiding Criminals.—In conversation on July 7 Fuad Bey enquired f™, AAr.? 3 t0 the P 08111 ? 1 ? re ° ardin S raidiD g criminals He was told that the fuither points raised by the Hejazi Government had presented great difficulty and were still being examined. Now at the end of June the High Commissioner for Trans-Jordan had expressed the view that the raid ing criminals formula (see May-June Report paragraph 25) should he dropped and a formal extradition agreement negotiated in its stead Up had therefore proposed that the Trans-Jordan delegation to Jedda be' fnlh empowered to negotiate a suitable formula only if Hejazi opposition to a forma extradition agreement could not be overcome. The delegation would consist of Mr. Kirkbr.de only as the Amir Abdullah was not disposed to send a Trans-Jordan official. If an extradition agreement proved feasible however it would presumably be negotiated bv His Majesty’s Minister co-operating with Mr Kirkhride on behalf of His Majesty’s Government since the Amir Abdullah would almost certainlv object to direct between Trans-Jordan, and Ibn Sa’ud. On Au^st 5 ffis MaiX’ eminent expressed their general concurrence, provided the Heiazi Govern' ment were willing, but suggested that the agreement should be simiffifTn7 f k A form to the Dahra Agreement of 1925, i.e., signed by the Hejazi Govern ment and a British Plenipotentiary on behalf of the Trans-Jordan Govern ment. In that case Sir A. Ryan should negotiate and sign as plenipoten tiary, Mr. Kirkbride acting merely as his expert adviser. The High Commissioner for Trans-Jordan replied on August 21 that the Amir Abdullah would not agree, but that he insisted on requesting that the agree ment should be made by His Majesty’s Government as Mandatory and subsequently applied to Trans-Jordan by local legislation. There the matter has rested. 28. Mutual Recovery of Loot .—The Hejazi Government’s statement that, although many Trans-Jordan raiders were entering the Hejaz-Nejd with the loot they had previously taken from Hejaz-Nejd tribesmen, the Government were prepared to forego its recovery until Captain Glubb and Ibn Seyd had met and agreed thereon, provided that Trans-Jordan should do likewise (see May-June Report paragraph 30), was but coldly received in Trans-Jordan. The latter preferred to keep a free hand, suspecting the proposal as designed to seduce Trans-Jordan tribes from their allegiance. The matter was accordingly allowed to drop in the hope that it would soon be superseded by the happy results of the Glubb-Ibn Seyd meetings. 29. Allegations against Captain Glubb .—On July 5 the Hejazi Gov ernment reminded His Majesty s Minister that they nad not received any reply to their note of June 3, in which were enumerated various misdeeds alleged against Captadn Glubb (see May-June Report paragraph 29). At the end of July His Majesty’s Charge d’ Affaires received from the High Commissioner for Trans-Jordan a copy of Captain Glubb’s remarks on the allegations, dated June 14 and running into a dozen close-typed sheets. A few days previously he had received instructions form His Majesty’s Gov ernment to base on this report a reasoned reply to the Hejazi allegations of June 3, and at the same time to make it clear that His Majesty’s Govern ment strongly resented such baseless accusations levelled against a British officer whose reply showed the patience and loyalty with which he had work ed and justified the confidence which His Majesty’s and the Trans-Jordan Governments originally placed in him and continued to hold. 30. Before the draft of a reasoned reply, there were two points of detail on which His Majesty s Charge d’ Ana'ires had to seek eniigntenment from Trans-Jordan (in a telegram dated August 1), and also a point of principle concerning one case of “retaliatory confiscation” to use the Hejazi term, which he referred to His Majesty’s Government at the same time for further instructions. The latter replied that they preferred for reasons of policy not to have conveyed to the Hejazi Government any endorsement of Captain Glubb’s action in this case, even though the confiscation was made in exceptional circumstances, but rather to let the gist of his report on the incident speak for itself. No reply having been received from Trans jordan, further telegraphic enquiry was made on August 13 but no reply was forthcoming by the end of the month. Mr. Hope Gill’s reply to the Hejazi Note of June 3 was therefore held up. 31. MacDonnelVs Investigation .— His Majesty's Government’s arbitral finding on raid claims prior to the 1st August 1930 was communicated to the Hejazi Government on August 12. It was worded as follows : His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom have considered the report submitted to them by Mr. MacDonnell on the results of his investigation into the claims arising from raids from the Hejaz-Nejd into Trans-Jordan and from Trans-Jordan into the Hejaz-Nejd which took place before August 1, 1930. Owing to the insufficient and often contradictory nature of the information and evidence furnished to Mr. MacDonnell; to the length of time which has elapsed since the dates of many of the raids involved; and owing moreover to the fact that the conditions under which Mr. MacDonnell was obliged to carryout his investigation did not permit of his conducting his en quiries on the actual sites of raids or of his having the opportunity of examining all available witnesses, the iniorm- ation is not such as to enable His Majesty’s Government to make an exact award on each claim submitted, kor this reason His Majesty’s Government are not in a position to make a detailed estimate as to the amount of loot taken from the nationals of either Government by nationals of the other. The information furnished to His Majesty’s Government is, however, sufficient to enable them to judge that it would be fair and reasonable that all claims referred to them by both Govern ments concerned should be held to cancel each other out. His Majesty’s Government conclude, therefore, that all claims arising from raids between the two countries which took place before 1st August 1930 should, on the basis of such cancella tion, be held to be settled and conclusively disposed of. This is His Majesty’s Government’s final finding. A month elapsed before a reply was received conveying Ibn Sa’ud’s reaction from Riddh. It falls to be recorded in the next Report. 32. Frontier Line .—Survey operations in connection with the Haifa- Baghdad railway discovered a small error near Jebel Tubaik in the boundary traced on the Southern desert Maps of Trans-Jordan to define His Majesty s Government’s unilateral declaration of the 19th May 1927. Brought to the notice of His Majesty’s Government in July, its rectification was called tor. t ’Iraq. 33. Relations were undisturbed. 34. Although by the beginning of July both representatives—elect had been named, neither had proceeded by the end of August. The Hejaz-JSejd Consul-General elect, Rushaid Pasha, was apparently awaiting the arrival of his ’Iraqi opposite number before leaving himelf. An enemy ot long standing of both Ibn Sa’ud and the Hashimites, Rushaid Pasha is now to represent Ibn Sa’ud in the Hashimite capital. Kowait and Bahrain. 35 Colonel Biscoe and Shaykh Hafiz Wahba had a friendly meeting at the Foreign Office on July 21, when mention was made of the possibility of Ibn Sa’ud being near the Hasa coast in September and of a visit from Colonels Biscoe and Dickson being arranged (see May-June Report para- graph 33). t . . 36. Two cases of intrusion by officials of Ibn Sa’ud into Kowait terri tory were reported in August. T , 37 An uncertain figure passed through Jedda in July, apparently returning to Kowait after some ten months stay in the Hejaz as a guest of Ibn Sa’ud. His name was Khan Bahadur Abdul Latif ibn Abdul Ja , one time Director of Kewait Customs, decorated at the New Year 1930 convicted for forgery in June, given a letter of recommendation by the Political Agent in August, and kept hanging about for nearly a year in the Hejaz for a job which never materialised. Yemen and Asm. 38 A sir C oimnunicdtions . —As a result of an exchange of views with the Italian Government on the question of de facto as opposed to de jure recomition of the Sa’udi status of Asir raised by the Hejazi Government s reouest for the establishment of wireless communication between Jisan and a den and of postal communication between Jisan and Kamaran (see May June Report paragraph 36), His Majesty’s Charge d Affaires wasf 9 instructed on June 28 to reply to the Hejazi Note of March 11, merely stating that His Majesty’s Government agreed to the establishment of wire less communication between Aden and Jisan, detailed arrangements for which would be made by Aden through the Legation, and that they saw no objection to the establishment of postal communication between Kamaran and Jisan. On receipt of further instructions in the latter connection His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires informed the Hejazi Government on August 8 that it was assumed that the proposed exchange of mails would be made in accordance with the principles of the Universal Postal Convention and subsidiary agreements, so far as these applied. 39. Status of A sir .—The political issue of the recognition of the actual status of Asir was met by informing the Italian Government that in defer ence to their views (which were strongly anti-recognition of any kind) no formal recognition of Asir’s new status would be conveyed by His Majesty’s Government to the Hejazi Government, but that it was not practical politics to refuse to correspond with them on matters of practical interest to the country. No mention of the question of recognition whether de jure or de facto, was of course to be made to the Hejazi Government. 40. Military Affairs .—Intelligence reports from Aden during August combined to give warning of a certain degree of activity in the northern Yemen, possibly directed against Asir. Thus on August 8 the report was recorded that the Imam Yahya had raised the pay of all his regular forces by twenty per cent, and authorised a special allowance of twenty per cent, for service in the Tihran, i.e. y the coastal belt; on August 15 that the Indz was organising an expedition against the Dakan confederation who were supposed to be giving him trouble in his northern territories; and that on August 23 an expedition of six companies of regulars was being fitted out at Sau’s under the. Imam’s son, Sword-of-Islam Ahmad, for service in the North. 41. Although the boundary between Asir and the Yemen has never been defined, the Hejazi Government decided in mid-August that it had been violated by the Imam’s troops. As Viceroy of the'Hejaz in his father’s absence, the Amir Feyzal telegraphed instructions on August 13 to the this very evil act, and to demand the punishment of the violaters, an apology withdrawn 1 of the Yemeni advanced posts, the return of thirty hostages (presimistically described by the Legation’s translator as mortgages), and the payment of compensation and blood-money. Apparently on August 23, although the true date was probably earlier and the transmission via Maseam delayed, Ibn Sa’ud himself telegraphed to the Izda to say that he was told that the latter’s troops had reached JabaT Arza in Asir, occupied it and taken thirty hostages—but he could not believe it. If, however, it were a fact and ordered by the Imam, then there was neither might nor power save in Allah. The sequal falls to be told in the next report. 42. Sir A. Ryan sailed from Jedda. on Julv 19 in H. M. S. “Lupin” for five months leave of absence. Mr. Hope Gill became Chargd d’Affaires. 43. Hejazi relations wiith His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom were not strained at any point. Exchanges over Trans-Jordan were rather tiresome, as already recounted in paragraphs 15 to 31, but Imam’s other fosterlin ’Iraq gave not a moment’s anxiety, 44. The signed Money order Agreement with Palestine was received from the Hejazi Government in Julv and transmitted to Jerusalem together with two Notes from the Mecca Postmaster-General concerning a typing error in the English version and the settlement of “interest” on’outstand^ ing accounts. L807(C)F*PD Amir of Jisan to protest to the Governor of Kidi, the Imam’s son, against III. RELATIONS WITH STATES OUTSIDE ARABIA. Brztish Empire.vatcefe, 4aMnJL 10 45. The Hejazi Government were reminded in July that the Govern ment of India were still awaiting the revised versions of a similar Agree ment. The Hejazi debt to the Government of India for arms has already been referred to in paragraph 10. 46. The question of British banking for this country has been dealt with in paragraph 3. Matters concerning British personnel in the Hejaz Air Force in paragraphs 66 to 68; and the proposed Arabian Air Route in paragraphs 69 to 72. 47. The Hejazi Government’s co-operation with the Legation for the commission of slaves is reported in paragraphs to 48. International .—Before Sir A. Ryan’s departure Fuad Bey Hamza took him for another ride on his hobby-horse. He trotted out Hejaz-Nejd and the League of Nations, Hejaz-Nejd and the Inter national Sanitary System, Hejaz-Nejd and the Arms Traffic Convention, and a newcomer, Hejaz-Nejd and the Disarmament Conference. But this time he found Sir Andrew booted and spurred with instructions. 49. League of Nations. —Fuad Bey was reminded that in his enquiries of last year he had limited himself to seeking the views of His Majesty’s Government regarding the legal position. He was now told that although it was not for one Government to pronounce on a question which might con cern the League as a whole, the matter had been examined in London with a view to giving the Hejaz-Nejd such friendly assistance as was possible. Fuad Bey was given certain conclusions which were to be drawn from the data available as to the character of the union between the Hejaz and Nejd and its Dependencies, and the further conclusions to be deduced therefrom as to the position of Hejaz-Nejd in regard to possible membership of the League. Asked as to whether his Government had made up their minds to seek admission to the League or were merely exploring the possibility, Fuad Bey intimated that no decision had been taken; they were merely looking into the matter. 50. International Sanitary System .—Three definite points emerged. (a) If the Hejaz-Nejd Government wished to attach reservations to their ratification of the International Sanitary Convention of 1926, they could only do so with the previous consent of all States signatory or accessory to the Convention. For this purpose it would be necessary for them to com municate the proposed reservations to the French Government for trans mission to those States, (b) The question of obtaining a seat on the Alexandria Quarantine Board was one the decision of which rested with the Egyptian Government, (c) The Hejaz-Nejd Government might find it ad vantageous to accede to the Rome Convention of 1907 and thereby acquire the right to representation on the Committee of the International Office of Public Health at Paris. The official action necessary would be to notify the Italian Government in accordance with article 6 of the Convention. 51. Fuad Bey was warned in friendly fashion that it was really most desirable to work up a good sanitary administration in this country. At the same time he was reminded that other countries would continue to pro tect themselves, within the limits of international arrangements, against the special dangers arising from the dispersal of the large numbers of pos sible disease carriers brought together by the pilgrimage. 52. Arms Traffic Convention .—Fuad Bey was told that the purely technical difficulties in the way of the accession of a non-signatory State before the Convention came into force were probably not insuperable, but that, re garded as a practical proposition, it seemed doubtful whether the accession of any particular non-signatory State, which saw advantage in making itself a party to the Convention and thereby undertaking the onerous obligations which it would impose when it came into force, would at present amount to more than a demonstration of sympathy with the objects of the Convention. So many signatory States had delayed ratification that it could only be regarded as doubtful whether the Convention would come into force in the11 near future, if indeed it ever did come into force without amendment. These views were given as personal to Sir A. Ryan and were balanced with the object of avoiding any appearance of seeking to influence the Hejaz-Nejd Government’s decision. They, of course, are chiefly con cerned with removing the supposed stigma attaching to the inclusion of Arabia in one of the “special menace”. 53. Disarmament Conference. —Fuad Bey complained that the Hejtaz- ]\ T ejd had not been invited, although all sorts of Powers non-members of the League had received invitations. He mentioned pointedly Egypt and ’Iraq. This matter Sir A. Ryan referred home and Mr. Hope Gill was instructed in August, should Fuad Bey again raise the matter, to tell him that His Majesty’s Government had not been consulted as to whether the Hejaz-Nejd should be invited or not, the matter of invitations having been left entirely to the Secretariat of the League. Fuad Bey did raise the ques tion and received his answer. He made no further attempt to enlist the in terest of His Majesty’s Government. 54. Orientalists and Municipalities. —The Hejaz-Nejd were neverthe less invited by the Dutch Government in July to send a representative to the International Conference of Orientalists at Leydn, and by His Majesty’s Government in August to appoint official delegates to the 1932 Fifth Inter national Congress of Local Authorities in London; they were also requsted to tell their local authorities about this Congress. There is no one really clever enough, and no one rich enough was found, to go to Leydn. As for the Congress of 1932, the meantime is no doubt being spent in pondering the European entanglements and spiritual dangers to be faced, if municipal pil- orims from the Holy Places of Islam are to seek the electric light 1’the West. 55 . France. —The treaty negotiations have not yet produced the treaty (see May-June Report, paragraph 44). 56. Italy. —Nor have the Italian Consul’s treaty hopes been fulfilled (see May-June Report, paragraph 56). He went on leave on July 19, having failed, for the second year in successation, to take the treaty with him. 57. A little but very virulent anti-Italian propaganda has been circulat ing in the Hejaz in the form of pamphlets introduced from Syria. They are inspired by the Kufra incident of the early summer. 58. The Netherlands.—The Netherlands Charge d’Affaires at Jedda, M. Van de Moulon, returned to Jedda from the Hadhramfut (see May-June Report, paragraph 46) on about July 10, and left finally on July 17. 59 . The following Hejazi appointments abroad were announced in July : Sheykh Hafis Wahba to be Ibn Sa’ud’s Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Planipotentiary at The Hague; Sheykh Abdullah Ibrahim-al-Fadhl to be first Secretary in charge of the Hajaz-Nejd Legation at The Hague; Seyyid Hamma-al-Chouti to be Hejaz-Nejd Consul in Batavia. 60. Hejazi negotiations for a Dutch loan have been reported in para graph 9. 61. Egypt.— R^hz Amer Bey made several visits during July and August to Mecca and Taif, presumably to continue discussion of matters affecting the Mahmdi (see May-June Report, paragraph 48). 62. Sidky Pasha made a statement in the Cairo Chamber of Deputies on July 13, in regard to the practice of sending the Mahmdi, accompanied with large consignments of cash and corn, annually to the Hejaz. He traced the reasons why it was discontinued and averred that the Egyptian Government would be glad to be in a position to distribute these alms to the poor of Mecca and Medina, as in the past, as soon as the causes of disagree ment with the Hejaz Government disappeared.12 m i 63. Sotiet Russia .—The Soviet Minister’s efforts in working up the sale of petroleum products (see May-June Report, paragraph 51) resulted in the signature in August of a thirty thousand pound contract for benzine from Batoun. Details of the deal have been given in paragraph 10. 64. United States of A merica .—As already mentioned in paragraph 12, Mr. Tritchell is expected to return in October with six American prospect ors. It is understood that the Hejazi Government have managed to remit three hundred pounds for their passages. When they arrive and be&lt;dn work they will no doubt expect something in the way of salary. It is a pity that there is no American representative here to help them to get it. 65. Turkey.—The Turkish Charge d’Affaires at Jedda, Abdul Ghani Sani Bey, left finally on July 30 for Angora, where he was to be made head of the Arabian section of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. No successor had arrived by the end of August. IV. AIR MATTERS. 66 . Hajaz Air Messrs. Morris and North finally got away on July 15 (See May-June Report, paragraph 57). Orders to pay them their arrears and passage money had apparently been given from Mecca on about June 20, but no trace of them could be discovered in Jedda until the end of the month. A further fortnight was required to find the five hundred pounds in golden sovereigns and bankers’ credits, without which Messrs. Morris and North declined to leave the country. 67. There only remained Mr. Lowe. He was shocked to find one morn ing in July that the aerodrome guard had orders to refuse his admittance. This he attributed to base intrigue by the Russian Krakowaky (see May- June Report, paragraph 53) and came to pour out his woes to the Legation. He was told that having taken service under a foreign Government and played his own game he must make the best of its ways and the rules, but that if on a straight issue he was being unjustly treated as regards con tractual conditions such as pay he would be given a reasonable measure of assistance as a British subject. He returned at the end of the month to ask for a loan of ten pounds, but as it was found that he had made no real effort to obtain arrears amounting to some one hundred and fifty pounds due to him, he was advised to take all possible steps himself, before throwing himself on the Legation’s assistance. The Hejazi Government informed him on August 6, that they did not wish to renew his contract and that he could take the terminal leave due to him on August 15. The miserable specimen at once yearned to re-enter their service and at the end of the month signed a clendestime contract with the Turkish corporal who acts on Hajazi Director-General of Military Affairs, binding himself to impos sible terms for a further twelve months. He was eventually got rid of in September—a matter for the next report. 68 . The Hejazi proposals for the reorganisation of their air force per sonnel having received His Majesty’s Government’s consideration (see May-June Report^ paragraph 56), His Majesty’s Minister conveyed to them the Air Ministry’s views in a memorandum dated July 7. No reply was received by the end of August. 69. Arabian Air Route .—In the House of Lords debate of June 23, on air communications with the East, the Under Secretary of State for Air said, Meanwhile, we are pushing on with the examination of an alternative route along the southern coast of the Persian Gulf, that is, along ihc Arabian Coast. This is being actively explored. Both land and marine aircraft of the Royal Air Force have been making flights of increasing fre quency from Basra to Muscat, thus acting as pioneers for ultimate civirdeve- lopment.■*&gt;- 13 70. On July 7, His Majesty’s Minister tackled Fuad Bey Hamza in regard to the exact meaning of the last sentence of the Hajazi memorandum of June 18 (see May-June Report, paragraph 60) . His reply showed clearly that what they had in mind was a contract of some kind similar to the one believed to have been made with the Persian Government by Imperial 'Airways. Sir A. Ryan’s impression was that the Hajazi Government were trying to discover what could be got out of His Majesty’s Government and/or Imperial Airways before committing themselves. He thought that Ibn Sa’ud’s recent tendency to conciliate extreme Wahhabi opinion was probably not without effect on the position, however, for the Nejdi Ulema might well dislike any truck with foreign aeroplanes in Nejd. 71. At the end of August His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires was posted with information as to the latest developments connected with the proposed Arabian Air Route, in case the matter were pursued with the Hajazi Gov ernment. The position had been somewhat altered since the beginning of the year (see January-February Report, paragraph 45) by the proposal of Imperial Airways to use flying-boats instead of land-planes in the event of their transferring the Persian Gulf section of their air service to India to the Arabian coast of the Gulf. The acquisition of facilities for land- planes on the Hasa coast was therefore no longer of immediate importance, in so far as Imperial Airways were concerned. No question of a contract between them and the Hejazi Government was thus likely to arise. 72. British aircraft using the Hasa coast would therefore for the pre sent be likely to be almost exclusively military. The facilities which His Majesty’s Government desired to secure for such aircraft remained as before/namely, the provision of emergency landing grounds on the Hasa Coast and an' assurance that, if British aircraft were compelled in emer gency to enter and alight on Nejdi territory or in Nejdi territorial waters, they would be treated in accordance with the usual rules of international courtesy and their occupants with ordinary humanity. V. MILITARY MATTERS. 73. Northern Hejaz .—There was unrest and movement in the North throughout July and in August. The Beni Atiya, who lay northernmost of the Hejazi tribes, were apparently given carts blanche by Ibn Sa’ud to pre vent defections to Trans-Jordan of dissatisfied elements among the Hejazi tribes further South. Even officials were reported as having deserted, the Amir of A1 ’Ula, Sheykh Ismail Qauds, and a Nejdi officer of regulars, named Hamaami (?) amongst them. The Beni Ativa seem to have interpreted their role in a liberal sense and to have raided the ’Anima, Billi, and Harb to some purpose, while the Amirs of Dhaba and Tabflk looked on. In early July Mr. Philby tried to make his way as far as Tabuk with a pair of the new Marconi Mobile stow (?) for testing purposes and to spy out the land, but he was not allowed further North than A1 ’Ula. By August Captain Glubb of the Trans-Jordan frontier police considered that there was a possibility of Ibn Sa ud ordering Ibn Musa id, his Amir of Rail (?) into the Northern Hejaz with his Shammar (?) to restore ordev, with probable complications in the shape of a maes (?) Beni Atiya with drawal into Trans-Jordan for refuge. 74. In the middle of July, however, Ibn Sa’ud sent his kinsman ’Abdullah as-Sudairi as Amir to Tabuk with a dozen cars, Nejdi troops, and four lossiesfull of arms and ammunition, as well as a camel-gun pro- baUv the 47a,/m Pocisk (?) presented to Ibn Sa’ud by Poland m August last tear On arrival he seems to have concerted action with the Amir of Dhaba, who had a forced of 100 camelmen at his disposal, to overawe the northein tribes Having apparently succeeded in restoring internal order, e urne hVs attention to the frontier and carried out motor-patrols near Mudawwara. Captain Glubb has since reported that the Trans-Jordan police posts are teing answered post for post on the other side of the frontier by the northern L807(C)F&amp;PD14 Amirs of Tabuk and Jauf. The latter, Turki as-Sudairi, cousin to him of 1'abuk and successor of the notorious an-Nashmi, was said in August to have five machine guns, some six hundred rifles, and about one hundred and sixty thousand rounds of S. A. A. Young Ibn ’Abdul Wahid has been appointed Amir of Qaryat al Milh, vice Abdullah al Hawaii, an old man and peaceful ’Abdul ’Aziz Ibn Zeyd, Ibn Sa’ud’s Controller of Beduin and frontier repre sentative at Qaryat, was reported in August to have fifty men and rifles and .four lorries. 75. East (Nejd ).—There were vague reports of “trouble in Nejd” throughout July and August but nothing resulted. There seemed no doubt, however, that the tribes were being more strictly taxed than usual, probably thanks to ibn Sa’ud’s presence, which would account for a certain feeling of unrest. Beduin anxious for largesse camped in considerable numbers round ;Riadh. 76. South (A sir ).—The trouble simmering on the Asiri frontier with the Yemen has been described in paragraphs 40 to 41. VI. NAVAL MATTERS. 77. H.M.S. “Lupin” (Captain E. B. C. Dicken) visited Jedda for a few hours on July 19, to embark His Majesty’s Minister on his departure on leave. There were no other naval visits, British or other. 78. On July 11, His Majesty’s Minister submitted to His Majesty’s Government his views on the advisability of the more frequent visits by His Majesty’s ships to ports in the Hejaz and Asir desired by the Admiralty. No final decision was communicated before the end of August. VII. PILGRIMAGE. 79. The debris of the 1931 pilgrimage from India was cleared away on July 15, when three hundred and eighteen destitutes were repatriated at Govt, of India expense (see May-June report, paragraph 68). This figure, out of a total of only seven thousand Indian pilgrims, compared badly with the figures for 1930, namely, three hundred and eighty-seven destitutes among eleven thousand pilgrims. 80. British West African pilgrims seeking to return to Africa by the customary desert route to Lith and sunbuq (?) voyage to Macsown met with great difficulties and hardship, which in August began to cause a reflux and destitution. The necessity for their repatriation was being studied locally at the end of August. SI. A vast amount of head-and paper-work was done by His Majesty’s Minister between the end of the pilgrimage and his departure on leave, cover ing the thousand and one points raised by the Indian Haj Inquiry Com mittee’s Report. Detailed memoranda and despatched on all current issues were submitted to His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India by the beginning of August, in good time for consideration before the 1932 pilgrimage begins. VIII. SLAVERY. 82. The last Report omitted to record the number of slaves manumitted bv the Legation. Two males were freed in May, 2 males and 1 female in June, 1 male and 2 females in July, and 3 males and 2 females in August. All were repatriated via Port Sudan, except the last 2 females, whom it was found possible to have manumitted locally by a willing owner, and 2 of the males freed in August; these were sent via Jibuti to Addis Ababa (see para graphs 84 and 85).15 83. The increasing difficulties of shipping manumitted Abyssinian slaves to Massowa for repatriation (See March-April Report, paragraph 64) came to a head in July, when the Eritrean authorities communicated impossible terms through the Italian Consul in Jedda. These terms effectively closed the Massowa route. 84. Luckily the Abyssinian Government were induced by His Majesty’s Legation at Addis Ababa to interest themselves in the libration and repatria tion of two Ethiopian boys sold while on pilgrimage, one of whom succeeded in escaping to this Legation. They were repatriated in August direct to Jibuti and may serve to mark this route for regular use for this purpose in future. 85. For the first time in its life the Hejazi Government co-operated with His Majesty’s Government and implemented Article 7 of the Jedda Treaty of 1927. They sought out the other boy in Mecca, held courts of enquiry, sent him to the Legation for repatriation, and followed him up with a full report 'plus a request that the Abyssinian Government be invited to force their slave-trading subject to refund eighty pounds, the proceeds of his sale to his (Hejazi client. 86 . There was less inclination shown in investigating a case that had a similar complexion and concerned one of the Sanusi family, who came on pil grimage from the Sudan and was remarked to have returned there without having his black attendants. Pressed, however, by His Majesty’s Minister, Fuad Bey Hamza made enquiries and reported in July that the two had left Mecca for Lith and Massawa, which tallied with the Legation’s independent information. IX. MISCELLANEOUS.. 87. Visitors .—His Highness the Nawab of Bahawalpur paid a rapid visit to the Holy Places of Islam in July. Mr. Twitchell visited Jedda again at the end of July. His work has already been referred to in paragraph 12. Marconi’s expert, Mr. Boucicault, left Jedda at the beginning of August to rig wireless at Tabuk, but at the end of August he still lay half way at Wejh and calling for petrol. 88 . Staff .—Sir Andrew Ryan went on leave on July 19. Mr. Hope Gill became Chargd d’Affaires. Mr. Furlonge was given a fortnight’s sick-leave on August 26, to re cuperate at Erkowit in the Sudan. The second Archivist, Captain Lewis, left on July 23, for two months special leave in England. 89. Before leaving His Majesty’s Minister drafted his detailed recom mendations to the Government of India for the complete reorganisation of the Indian and Medical sections of the Legation, with a view to its taking effect as from 1st January, 1932.Secret. Endorsement No. 121, dated the 1st December 1931.

I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosure to Cairo, Jeru salem, Beirut, Damascus, Baghdad, Basra, New Delhi, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Aden, Addis Ababa, Lagos, Khartoum, Port Sudan, the Senior Naval Officer in Red Sea Sloops, and the Royal Air Force Officer Command ing in Palestine and Trans-Jordan.&lt; IU 19 I. INTERNAL AFFAIRES. Ibn Sa'ud .—The King spent September and October at Riadh, whence he made a number of three and four-day excursions to neighbouring centres and oases for sport and the diversion of picnicking. These were no doubt mixed with a little local politics, but he seems to have avoided w T ork of any kind as much as possible. He did not pay his projected visit to the Hasa coast, nor did he move in force to Hail, as rumour alleged, !to forestall the Shammar rising which was expected to follow the circumstantially reported escape of some of the Rashidi family from Riadh. All this and other similar and repeated news of “trouble in Nejd” proved unfounded. There was at most a certain dissatisfaction amongst the tribes at having to pay taxes instead of receiving bounty from the King. 2 . Ibn Sa’ud, during this period of retreat in Nejd, has been described as disheartened in spirit, disillusioned in mind, and approaching impotence in body. This last disability seemed to have poisoned his whole outlook, so that he had become morose and reticent, withdrawing himself for the greater part of the day into the quarters outside Riadh where he kept his slaves and concubines, spending long nights with one or other of his wives, and only finding relaxation between whiles in the company of a few Beduin cronies, where the talk was of women and camels. In the past it has been his wont, even in Riadh, to devote many hours daily to current affairs of his dual monaryhy, but he seems this summer to have lost all interest in them, so that even his industrious Rais ad-Diwan, Sheykh Uusuf Yasin, mooned about with nothing to do. These activities and this indolence suggest that his Majesty, who is now fifty-^two and has had a strenuous sexual career, has now reached a stage of conflict between desire and its fulfilment. 3. The Hejaz .—While the King was thus employed in Nejd, govern ment of the Hejaz lapsed more and more into the Beduin hands of his Director-General of Finance. Sheykh ’Abdullah Suleyman, having placed his numerous relatives in key positions, himself moved to and fro between Taif, Mecca, Jedda and Medina levying contributions in cash and kind and disposing of them none knew how. His bodyguard and style came to overshadow those of the Viceroy, whom he kept short of funds. He made the Vice-President of the Legislative Assembly, ’Abdullah Ibrahim al Fadhl, his jackal. Fuad Bey Hamza, the only other important func tionary in the Hejaz, he reduced to impotence by continuing to deprive him and all the Foreign Ministry personnel of their pay and completely , ignoring him and his communications. Throughout September he con solidated his position as dictator in the King’s absence. By the middle of October he was supreme. At the end of October he was called at last to account. 4. The period of this ignorant Nejdi’s rule was chaotic and critical. As foreshadowed in the last report (July-August Report, paragraphs 40 and 41), September opened with a threat of war from the Yemen. There was urgent necessity to send reinforcements and ammunition to meet it, but there was neither money nor petrol available. ’Abdullah Suleyman raised forced loans from the merchants and (two hundred and fifty troops were sent by sea to Jizan, but the military transport was held up for lack of fuel. He pressed the Soviet Legation for the benzine they had con tracted to supply (July-August Report paragraph 10); it had not even left Batun. He pressed Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co., for Shell benzine on credit; knowing their man they offered it on cash terms only. Messrs. Sharqieh Ltd., quoted similar terms for Standard oil. He pressed the Dutch Bank for credit; they refused it pending the outcome of the nego tiations in Amsterdam (July-August Report, paragraph 9). On the 12th September they informed ’Abdullah Suleyman that the negotiations had failed and that no more credit would be given. The same night a clean sweep was made of all the benzine held in Jedda. Government lorries plied all night at the task, and when Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co , and Messrs Sharqieh, Ltd., woke next morning, they found the warehouse emty and their stocks gone.20 I n 5. This coup made a profound local impression. Although such action by the Government is not unknown in Jeddah, it had never been carried but on such a grand scale. It soon became evident however that, whereas some five thousand pounds worth of benzine was removed that night, the theft was in reality much greater. It had been continuing for some time; the official returns of stocks bounded in the Government warehouse had been systematically falsified. It transpired furthermore that, in order to cloak the process, the Shell and Standard Oil Companys’ agents had been denied access to their Stocks for purposes of verification, on the plea that the storekeeper had gone to Taif and had taken his keys with him. Having current supplies in hand they had weakly accepted the plea. They now found that they had lost twelve thousand pounds worth of Shell benzine and four thousand pounds of Standard oil. Sharqieh, Ltd., awaited Mr. Philbv’s return from Riadh—he was shortly expected. Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co. at once protested ito the local authorities, who in their turn protested complete innocence and ignorance of the whole affair. His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires therefore used the expedient of a telegram in plain English to the Minister for Foreign Affairs at Taif, an effective means in a country where there is no Press and the authorities are consequently sensitive to publicity. An arrangement was forthwith nego tiated by ’Abdullah Suleman wfth Ithe Shell agents, by which he admitted resoonsibility and with the financial terms of which the agents were well pleased. The Government’s guilt thus established, His Majesty’s Chargd d’Affaires, with the approval of His Majesty’s Government, registered an official protest and requested a formal assurance that such high-handed action would not be resorted to again. 6 . September 13th was also marked by the spedtacular collapse of the Hejaz Air Force. ’Planes were required at Jizan to overawe both the Imam of Yemen and the dissidents of Asir. The only remaining British pilot, Mr. Lowe, had developed ear trouble, therefore he could not fly. A young Syrian adventurer, recently engaged as a pilot on the strength of his declared ability to fly a Noth, broke down at the prospect of flying a Wapiti; he was flogged and jailed, whereupon the French Charge d’Affaires at once became interested. A Turkish pecudo-mechanic, who also betrayed hesitation, was mauled by the Nejdi garrison but escaped into the Turkish Legation, where he was given refuge. Finally a German e#-War pilot, who had been keeping a myopic eye on the machines since the departure of Messrs. Morris and North, was persuaded by the General Officer Com manding the Hejaz Army (accompanied by 50 troops) to leave his bed where he lay ill with dysentery, and set out to fly to Jizan. After a few minutes he was seen to turn back. Above Jedda he shut off his engine and fainted, and the machine glided on its slots into the lagoon. The pilot survived; the German Consul intervened; and the Hejaz Air Force lay hors de combat, a position which it has since maintained. 7. The benzine coup and the air force collapse shook the morale of Government employees and titilated the expectations of the rest. The urban populations of the Hejaz were heartily sick of the Saudi regime. At Medina there was acute distress amounting almost to famine conditions. At Mecca people were beginning to go hungry. In Jedda the populace was in a poor way, while the landlord and merchant classes were exasperated almost beyond measure by, the extortions of ’Abdullah Suleyman. But there was neither leader nor the courage to rebel. Uti was hoped that the benzine incident would make trouble for the Sa’udi authorities and the belief was naturally fostered that the faidure of the air force was the result of foreiem intervention. The silver rival exchange rapidly fell to 17 to the £. Traffic ceased, since there was no motor fuel; the mails had to go by donkev. Further advances bv the Imam Yahya were reported and open hostilities were expected within the week. An appreciation of the general situation made on September 19th is given in paragraph 65. 8 . Certain colleagues were for making joint representations to the Hejazi Government about the air force personnel, but His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires declined to co-operate and urged rather the need ofbolstering up the confidence of the local Government instead of seeming to mob it. He nevertheless got into touch with the Senior Naval Officer, Ked Sea Sloops, who was lying at Port Sudan and concerted provisional arrangements in case a naval visit were to become advisable. Communica tions were the chief concern, for the Jeddah-Port Sudan cable is a decrepit link and the wireless station lies alongside the barracks. No trouble was anticipated from the Hejazi townsfolk, at best- a cravan element, but the Nejdi garrison had to be reckoned with. They were dissatished and under fed. iwo days later, indeed, they began to help themselves to food in the cookshops of the town and as soon as the Viceroy visited Jedda they raided his kitchens. 9. In the.face of these events ’Abdullah Suleyman remained in Mecca, hut it is to the credit of the Amir ley sal and luad Bey Hamza that they came to Jedda. They arrived on the 17th September, spent the T8th enquiring into the benzine affair, the air force position, and me complaints of the Nejdi soldiery. A canteen was opened for the latter, to be supplied with goods borrowed from the local tradesmen, since the Finance Depart ment would issue no pay, and the Viceroy left with Fuad Bey on the 19th September and returned to Taif. The visit served to lay the spectre of ’Abdullah Suleyman for the moment and to steady the nerves of local officials. Better news began to come through from Asir. The people relapsed into torpor again and ’Abdullah Suleyman resumed his acquisitive role. No one seemed able to withstand him. What he could not exact in cash he took in merchandise, which was at once knocked down for cash at auction. No one knew where the money went, buit a great deal must have gone to Riadh. A little went to the Hejaz-Nejd Minister in London, who had been telegraphing actively for funds. None went to other Government servants, whose pay had for ihe most part fallen eight months into arrear by the end of October. The “Government” at Taif ceased, to all practi cable intent or purpose, to exist. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs became the receiving office for unanswered complaints agains't the Finance Depart ment made by foreigners and delivered by donkeys. Th6 Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs retired into his projected “Handbook of the Hejaz and Nejd and its Dependencies. &lt; 10 . The credit for laying the first charge which eventually undermined the dictatorship of ’Abdullah Suleyman must be ascribed to Mr. Philby. He returned from Riadh at the end of September and was much struck by the news of the appropriation of his benzine. It contravened his standing arrangement with the Finance Department and placed him in an awkward position vis-a-vis of the Standard Oil Company. On arrival at Jedda he made further discoveries in regard to the ’Abdullah Suleyman regime. They achieved his reconversion from Sa’udi idolatry to sane citizenship. He wrote to ’Abdullah Suleyman such a letter (all of this is confidential, as indeed is Ithis report) as numbered with its amenities the reminder that the price of theft in this coun'try was the loss of the thieving hand, and the opinion that ’Abdullah Suleyman’s body therefore deserved to be cut into little pieces. He also wrote to Ibn Sa’ud. Then he went to Taif, where he found the Viceroy, Fuad Bey Hamza, the Viceroy’s Rais ad-Diwan Ibrahim al Fedhl, and his half-brother ’Abdullah Ibrahim al Fadhl, Vice- President of the Legislative Assembly and ’Abdullah Suleyman’s erstwhile jackal, putting their heads together in search of a way to break down ’Abdullah Suleyman’s ascendency. Under the stimulus of Mr. Philbv’s presence they drew up a lengthy memorandum to the King. Mr. Philby has described it as an ultimatum, involving wholesale resignation unless ’Abdullah Suleyman were removed, but Fuad Bey Hamza rather as a report, describing the chaotic situation in detail and submitting recommendations for its reform, to which ’Abdullah Suleyman was invited to subscribe. He very naturally refused. So the document was entrusted to ’Abdullah Ibrahim al Fadhl for presentation to His Majesty at Riadh. ’Abdullah Suleyman accompanied him there on the 23rd October. At the end of the month Ibn Sa’ud’s reaction was still anxiously awaited in the Hejaz. Fuad Bey, when he came to Jedda on October 29th, was nervous and LS07 (C;F&amp;rDa».. - V 22 despondent. He confessed to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires that he and his colleagues had lost all confidence in themselves. He seemed to be on the point of saying that they had lost all confidence in the King, when he changed the subject. 11. Ministry of Foreign Affairs .—The Under Secretary visited Jedda on the 31st August and left on the 4th September. His Majesty’s Chargd d’Affaires discussed a number of current questions with him on the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd, amongst them the Yemen situation, which is dealt with in paragraphs 43 to 47. Fuad Bey visited Jedda again on the 17th September, accompanying the Minister for Foreign Affairs, as already described in paragraph 9. Mr. Hope Gill was received by the young man who ms usual had nothing whatever to say beyond answering prettily that the King, his father, was well, thank God. The interview with Fuad Bey was short and unsatisfactory, marked chiefly by a clumsy denial of all Government responsibility for the benzine theft. The Amir and Fuad Bey left the same day, September 19th. to 'return to Taif. There they remained until Fuad Bey again visited Jedda on Ithe 29th October. In a private conversation on the 31st he unburdened himself to Mr. Hope Gill of his cares and fears for the future of this country. 12. Finance .—The silver riyal fell two more points in mid-September to seventeen to the gold pound. The official rate still stood at ten, how ever, which enabled the Government to pay at ten whenever 'they did pay, which was seldom, and to take, which they often did, at seventeen. But for the fact that large numbers of riyals were withdrawn from currency in the Hejaz, probably for use in Nejd, the exchange must have fallen considerably lower. The export of gold, except by special Government license, was forbidden by decree of October 16th. 13. External credit was still nil. British banks had declined to accept Sheykh ’Abdurrahman Qusaibi’s proposal to open a State Bank in the Hejaz (July-August Report paragraph 8). The Nederlandische Handal- Maatschappij ,also turned down his proposal that they should land Ibn Sa’dd half a million sterling (ibid, paragraph 9). Internal loans were therefore extracted by the Director-General of Finance wherever he went in the Hejaz and by means which have already been described in the pre ceding paragraphs. Very litltle was written down. Accounts were kept in ’Abdullah Suleyman’s head, which his creditors hoped no longer to see upon his shoulders when the day of reckoning should come. Poverty bred barter. When their benzine was so urgently sought, Messrs. Gellatly, TIankey and Co., were offered rice and raisins in exchange. The Ministry uf Foreign Affairs never has had a bank balance, but is used to make its diverse payments to the Legation, in respect of small claims and minor routine adjustments such as telegrams, in mixed currency tied up in scraps of old garments. When even this ceased, -the Legation’s accountant saw nothing for it but to expect payment in goods, three cakes of soap and a leg of mutton for instance. But the Ministry maintained caste and paid nothing. 14. The anxiously awaited Soviet benzine (July-August Report, para graph 10) did not materialise until October 20th, when a Greek five-masted schooner brought 30,000 cases. Contrary to the previous report (ibidem), the Soviet Charge d’Affaires has now stated that payment is not due until six months after each consignment’s delivery, when it would be due inte grally. He hopes to have no difficulty. 15. No external debt was reduced during September and October, ex cept for a surprise payment of five hundred pounds to the Eastern Telegraph Company on the 26th October. This appeared to result from certain written representations made by His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires personally to Fuad Bey Hamza on October 14th and from the absence of ’Abdullah Suleyman in Nejd. The balance was promised “in a few days, God willing’’.' The Deity has much to answer for in the Hejaz. The balance at the end of October amounted to something over two thousand five hundred pounds. &lt;/ 23 &lt; &lt; 16. Economic Development .—Work continued in desultory fashion during September and October on the Wazaria Wells outside Jedda and the Turkish aqueduct which connects them with'the town. The present wells were built by Osman Pasha, ruler of the Ottoman Hejaz, in 1882 6, but the springs were first exploited for the benefit of Jedda in about 1640. i he Turkish system was primitive and had already lapsed into decay early in the present century. It is now to be repaired, modernised, and donated with a windmill pump from Ohio (III)- 17. Mr. Twitchell returned from America on October 19th, bringing with him the pump, a hand drill and a prospecting engineer from Arizona. No serious work was begun until November. 18. Marconi Wireless Installation .—There is nothing definite to report. Even Mr. Philby Marconi’s agent, is vague as to what has been happening beyond the fact that the September and October instalments of payment fell into line of arrear with their predecessors (July-August Report para- o-raph 14) Mr Boucicault is believed to have completed the Tabuk station and to have moved on to Qaryat al Milh. Riadh has kept in commumcatjon with Taif bv means of the mobile sets. The Lmm-al-Qura of Octobe 30th announced that the stations at al Hasa and Buraida had been comple - ed, presumably by Marconi’s Egyptian engineer. 19. Legislation.—Ho legislation of any note has been promulgated. 20 Religious Intolerance. of a further Shi’a protest against desecration of tombs by the Wahhabis were received in September from i !i d f It had alreadv received the usual answer (July-August Report, paragraph 17) The Wahhabi Committee of Virtue continued its activities at Mecca (ibid, paragraph 16). 01 Communications. —The Heiazi Government received in October an ?

Raiding. ^-On October 19th the Acting High Commissioner for I rans-Jordan reported that on the 28th September some Nejdi Beduin had raided the Hejazi Beni Ativa at Hazim, in Nejd, and carried off two hundred camels belonging to‘the Trans-Jordan Howeytat which were graz ing with the Hejazi herds. A request was accordingly addressed to the Hejazi Government for their return. It would seem that the locality of this raid, the only one of the period, was really Hazm and not Hezim, which is 150 miles distant and in Trans-Jordan territory. The whimsical Laurentian mode of treating Arabic names has its disadvantages. 26. Glubb-Jbn 7eyd Meetings .—In a series of conversations held on September 1st to 3rd the Hejazi Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs made a determined attempt to engage His Majesty’s Chargd d’Affaires in a dis cussion of “additional principles” by which he sought to bind the frontier representatives at their meetings for the liquidation of raid claims. In memory of the complete agreement on the terms of reference etcetra, reach ed in June as a result of the prolonged exchange of views of March, April, and May (May-June Report, paragraphs 26 and 27), Mr. Hope Gill refused to discuss yet another set of “principles”. He contended that the frontier representatives must now be left a free hand to liquidate the claims on the agreed basis and not be further bound by restrictions. Faud Bey finally capitulated and professed himself only anxious to establish more principles for post-liquidation period of frontier co-operation. He expressed the ‘intention of submitting them in writing for His Majesty’s Government’s consideration, but had failed to do so by the end of October 27. On the 16th September he opened a new line of attack by writing to express regret at Captain Glubb’s apparent departure from Tirans-Jordan and to request that urgent steps be taken to liquidate the loot, the purpose for which Ibn Zeyd was still patiently waiting at Qaryat. This was a little difficult to answer, since the Colonial Office’s telegraphic enquiry of Trans-Jordan of September 2nd, repeated to Jedda and asking what was the position in regard to the Glubb-Ibn Zeyd meetings, had apparently not been answered and there had been no news of Captain Glubb’s movements for some time. His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires therefore made further telegraphic enquiry of the High Commissioner on September 20th. On the 1 st October, crossing a reminder, came the reply that Captain Glub would return from leave on October l$th and would be instructed to exchange lists of claims with Ibn Zeyd at an early date. Mr. Hope Gill, in inform* ing Faud Bey, expressed the hope that this time the Hejazi representative would be fully documented for his role. In reporting on the situation to His Majesty’s Government, he asked for information as to whether any decision which should affect his attitude had been taken as a result of the sombre conclusions reached by Captain Glubb after his last meeting with Ibn Zeyd (July-August Report, paragraph 25). Instructions were also sought as to whether the details of future frontier procedure and co operation, under the guise of Fuad Bey’s “additional principles” should be discussed at Jedda or left to the frontier representatives alone. 28. Preventive Measures .—The Hejazi Government took no steps during the period to bring to the knowledge of His Majesty’s Government the measures taken to prevent raiding from their side of the frontier (July- August Report, paragraph 26), and no steps beyond that narrated in para graph 26 above to seek collaboration with the trans-Jordan authorities in accordance with Hadda Agreement. 29. Raiding Criminals —No further advance was made from the posi tion described in the July-August Report, paragraph 27. The Amir ‘Abdullah having objected to taking any steps forward in the direction of recognising Ibn Sa’ud, His Majesty’s Government did not feel disposed at present to press him to reconsider his attitude about a raiding-criminal agreement with the Hejaz-Nejd. Nor were they inclined to adopt thealternative proposal made by the Acting High Commissioner for Trans jordan that they should themselves, as Mandatory for Trans-Jordania, conclude such aii agreement with Ibn Sa’ud. In any event, such an agree ment would be hardly workable in the face of hostility between the Arab authorities on either side. His Majesty’s Government therefore preferred to rely for the present on the existing policy of frontier co-operation. 30. Allegations against Captain Without waiting longer for the information asked for in his telegram of August 1st to Trans-Jordan. His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires took advantage of the presence of the Hejazi tinder Secretary for Foreign Affairs in Jedda on the 2nd September to reply to the June allegations against Captain Glubb on the lines laid down bv His Majestv’s Government (July-August Tteport, paragraphs .^9 and 30). He read to Fuad Bey enough of Captain Glubb’s reply of the 14th June to answer all the allegations and to meet his further questioning, without having to touch upon the details on which further information was awaited. Fuad Bey, as was to be expected, fastened upon the one case of “retaliatory confiscation’’ admitted by Captain Glubb. He asked whether His Majesty’s Government condoned or supported such action, but Mr. Hope Gill remained non-committal and treated the question as hardly serious. Faud Bey dropped it, but left the impression that he would raise it again when he got the chance. He has not yet done so, however. 31. MacDonnell Investigation .—Ibn Sa’ud’s reply to the anounce- ment of His Majestv’s Government’s arbitral finding on raid-claims prior to the 1st of August 1930 (July-August Report, paragraph 31) was made on the 10th September. While accepting the finding as binding and noting the cancellation of claims on both sides of the line, he was unable to refrain from going over old ground, criticising the weakness of the investigation, discounting the effects of his denial of Nejd territory to the investigator, and protesting that all available witnesses had been produced His Majesty assured the British Government that, in spite of difficulties which he enum erated and others too numerous to mention, he would abide by his undertak ing to accept the award. But he wished to know what procedure would be followed regarding the raids made since the 1st August 1930, when would a decision be made on them, and what measures would be taken to P rev ^ future raids. He believed that the deplorable situation created by the award could onlv be remedied by a liquidation of the past, the making o agreements with Trans-Jordan similar to those made with Iraq, and the “removal of those causes of friction on the Irans-Jordan frontier ^hic were causes of friction on the ’Iraq frontier;’’ no doubt meaning, chie y, Captain Glubb. 32 Under instructions from His Majesty’s Government of the 22nd of October His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires replied taking note of Ibn Sa’fid’s acceptance of the finding, ignoring his criticisms and his instinuation against Captain Glubb, and taking him up on wGh for knowledge which he already possessed. Ihe Hejazi Gov- rintent were Tminled that all claims'smce August 1930 were now ”'ttl haTcome fo'the ^ Sng l^pelessly unp^d; mam to chance the procedure except to improve the Hejazi side of saw no reason to change tn P tl,,™ were still waiting to T W As to'measuresfor preventing further 'raids, thev were still waiting to 1 &gt; nl lhe Heiazi Government were doing, the Trans-Jordan measures learn what the He ^ , , , ^ h av j n£ , secured encouraging results having ewry effort should be made to increase the scope and Th 7 1 ne« of the 1 cooperation between the frontier representatives. Cap- tafn Glubb had his instructions in this sense. His Majesty s Government trusted that Ibn Sa’ud would similarly instruct Ibn Zeyd. LS07(CPWPDV 26 amounted to one thouand seven hundred and twenty-six pounds seven sniiiings and eight pence. He invited them to pay. They have not paid as yet. 34. Refugees from the Hejaz .—At the end of August the semi-official “Umm-al-Qura” published a leading article which alleged that disaffected elements among the Hejazi tribes were being enticed into Trans-Jordan. The writer piously concluded that they must be either heretics, profligates, or criminals, of whom the Hejaz w r as well rid. They would find plenty of scope in ’Amman for their disgusting practices, he added, whereas in the Hejaz and Nejd the sword was nearer to the neck of such a one than his own jugular vein. The article would have been merely amusing but for its cal culated disrespect of His Highness the Amir Abdullah. 35. On the 3rd September, the Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs conveyed to His Majesty's Charge d’Affaires Ibn Sa’ud’s conviction that there was truth in the allegation of enticement. He requested Mr. Hope Gill to bring the facts described in the papers quoted by the “Umm-al Qura” to the notice of His Majesty’s Government in connection with Article 8 of the Hadda Agreement, which forbids such practices. He added an enquiry as to whether it were true that the Trans-Jordan Legislative Assembly had recently voted a credit for the construction of posts on the Hejaz-Nejd frontier. Both points were referred to His Majesty’s Govern ment on September 9th for instructions. 36. A second and much more virulent leading article appeared in the “Umm-al-Qura” of October 23rd. Before making representations to the Hejazi Government, His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires established to his own satisfaction the fact, later confirmed by Mr. Philby, that both articles came from the pen of Sheykh Yusuf Yasin. Mr. Philby had added that they were written with Ibn Sa’ud’s full knowledge and that repeated efforts had been made to induce himself to co-operate with messages to the “Near East” and the “Daily Herald” on the same subject. He had declined, say ing that he knew nothing of the facts of the matter and that in any case he had since long decided to write nothing for the press about the Hejaz- Nejd, having only severe criticism to offer. Mr. Hope Gill w r as therefore not surprised w r hen Fuad Bey Hamza, in reply to his formal representations of the 1st November, affected to view the articles with equanimity and even with some satisfaction. Feeling that he had the King and Yusuf Yasin behind him he sought to justify the articles as proper replies to the un warranted attacks made on the Hejaz-Nejd in the Arabic press and in spired by the Amir ’Abdullah. Moreover he would not admit that they were the work of Yusuf Yasin. Mr. Hope Gill was not in a position either to divulge Mr Philby’s information or to judge of what degree of provocation had been given. He therefore maintained his view that the articles were inexcusable and should not be repeated and referred the question of further action to His Majesty’s Government, with the suggestion that the return of His Majesty’s Minister to Jedda might serve as the occasion for an ex pression of his views on the behaviour of the Hejazi Government in his absence. 37 . In reply to Captain Glubb’s suggestion that, should the Beni Atiya (July-August Report, paragraph 73) seek refuge in J raT J s_Jo F dan , punitive measures by Ibn Sa’ud, they- should first be ordered back and then, if they refused, be ordered to move North of Ma’en and well away from the frontier. His Majesty’s Government stated in October that they were dis posed to agree, if the case presented itself in the precise circumstances ore- shadowed by Captain Glubb. In any other circumstances however they would need to consider the matter further m the light of the situation the prevailing No attempt by the Beni Atiya to take refuge m Trans-Jordan has been reported. 38. Frontier Line.—The Hejazi Government registered a formal pro- test on the 4th October against an alleged aerial trespass of the frontier *hree British machines on the 25th September in the neighbourhood of Qarvat al Milh. The complaint was referred to His Majesty s Government for investigation.( 1 ? ( V 27 ’Iraq. 39 . On September 2nd Fuad Bey Hamza broached with Mr. Hope Gill a question which Ibn Sa’ud said was causing him concern. A number of remnant chiefs of the 1929 rebellion were said to be residing at A1 Huwiqa, near the frontier, where they were being given noticeably friendly asylum bv the ’Iraqi authorities. Ibn Sa’ud did not wish to take the matter up with the ’Iraqi Government on the eve of the exchange of representatives, but he would be very grateful to His Majesty’s Government if something could be done about it. The request was passed on on September 9th. 40. Representatives, however, have not even yet been exchanged, for reasons that are obscure. An ’Iraqi Royal Irada of the 1st of October made the headquarters of the Consul-General for ’Iraq in the Hejaz-Neid 1 at Mecca instead of Jedda. This somewhat surprised and puzzled the Hejazi Government, who had not been consulted and who, while Nuri Pasha was here, had told him that Jeddq, was the diplomatic capital and that no ex ception could be made. 41. In mid-October King Faisal professed to be much perturbed by rumours of a large concentration at Jauf, which was said to be directed against the pipe-fine and railway surveys then proceeding in ’Iraq territory. In order to test Ibn Sa’ud’s attitude he invited him to agree to the opening of a pilgrim route through Jauf, and is believed to have suggested that Ibn Sa’ud should meet him there to inaugurate it. His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires could learn nothing in the* Hejaz about the supposed concentra tion. As regards the pilgrim route, the test was inconclusive, since Jauf is bound on the South by the sandy Nafud desert. As mentioned in para graph 21, the Hejazi Government are believed to have replied that this , route was unsuitable for motor traffic. Kowait and Bahrain. 42. The record of an inter-departmental meeting held at the Foreign * Office on August 12th was received at Jedda in September. Among other matters discussed were (1) the method of negotiating the questions awaiting settlement between Kowait and Nejd; it was agreed that Lieut. Colonel Biscoe accompanied bv Lieut. Colonel Hickson should in the first place visit Ibn Sa’ud on the first occasion when the latter’s presence near the Persian Gulf made this possible. (2) the Nejdi “blockade” of Kowait; there being little likelihood of an appeal to Ibn Sa’ud’s good nature being successful, it was agreed that the threat to raise the Bahrain transit dues on goods to Nejd, and if necessary the actual raising of the dues, should prove a useful weapon in the negotiations. (3) a proposed treaty for the settlement of future claims between Kowait and Nejd; it was agreed that in the circum stances no formal treaty was required. (4) past Kowaiti claims against Ibn Sa’ud - it was agreed that the claims amounting to some one hundred and ten thousand pounds, should be held over until conversations were opened with Ibn Sa’ud and then, if possible,, used as a lever in the negotiations. (5) the effect of the Hejazi Nationality law on Kowaitis and Bahrainis; it was ao-reed that the matter should not be discussed with the Hejazi Government unless the latter themselves forced an issue. (6) the future status of Kowait; it was ao-reed that the policy hitherto followed should be continued; namely that Kowait should be maintained as a protected State entnely indepen dent of either ’Iraq or Nejd. Asm and the Yemen. 43 The threat of war between Ibn Sa’ud and the Imam 1 ahya noted in the last report (July-August Report paragraphs 40 and 41) developed serious proportions in the beginning of September but was almost averted bv the end The situation continued to improve in October. It was com- nlicated in the first instance by the simultaneous and probably not uncon nected rising of certain Asiri tribes, notably the Masanha round Jizan, against the Nejdi occupation. After some delay due to lack of benzine for. 28 military transport, recounted in paragraph 4, reinforcements were sent by sea to the Amir of Jizan, and the Asiri situation was got in hand again. As a result probably of this show of resolution on the part of Ibn Sa’ud, reinforced by his telegraphic invocations of Allah A the Imam stayed his hand. He may also have felt Italian pressure at his end. Tbn Sa’ud, on his side, received urgent counsels of moderation from His Majesty’s Gov ernment. 44. On the 1st September, the Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs had informed His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires that the situation was regarded as serious. On the 4th the Hejazi Minister in London informed His Majesty’s Government that the Imam had occupied a number of places on the Hejazi side of the de facto frontier and was adopting so aggressive an attitude that if it were maintained there was a serious danger ,of open hostilities developing. The desirability was very strongly urged upon Sheykh Hafiz Wahba of Ibn Sa’ud adopting counsels of moderation and ex ercising the greatest possible patience in his dealings with the Imam. His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires was at the same time instructed to act similar ly at Jedda, emphasizing the disastrous results which might follow to the Hejaz from any outbreak of hostilities. The Italian Government undertook to urge similar counsels upon the Imam. Ibn Saud in reply expressed his gratitude to His Majesty’s Government for their advice and assured them that he was doing his best to follow it. As evidence, the Hejazi Ministry of Foreign Affairs communicated to His Majesty’s Chargd d’Affaires copies of all the messages exchanged between Ibn Sa’ud and the Imam. The for mer’s were pious and ponderous, the latter’s short and flippant. 45. During the first days of September the redoubtable Khalid bin Luwey, captor of Taif from the Hashimites, was sent southwards with a force of several thousand tribesmen on camels, with orders to collect more en route and enter Asir. He encountered apathy and even resistance on his way and took a month to reach his objective. On the 7th September the Hejazi authorities chartered deck-space on the Mogul Line’s Steam Ship “Jehangir”, then leaving for Aden, to transport to Jizan two hundred and fifty Nejdi “regulars”, a mixed bodv containing many slaves of African origins; also fifty aeroplane bombs. Because of the reefs she had to ap proach from the South and on arrival on September 11th lay hooting for half a dav off an apparently deserted town. Thinking it had already fallen, the captain prepared to leave, when a solitary dugout canoe ventured near. It held the port officer, disguised in a loin cloth; he was much relieved, to find the ship held Nejdi reinforcements. Her arrival from the direction of the Yemen had persuaded the local defence that she was full of enemy Yemenis. On the 17th September Aden reported that the Imam was conniving at agression on the Asir frontier in the regions of Jabal Fifa and Jabal Bazih, in the hope that Ibn Sa’ud’s inactivity would give him the chance of occupying Sabya, Abu ’Arish and Jizan and eventually the Farsan Islands. \ contributory cause of the Imam’s activity was said to be his anxiety at the grave decline of his port of Midi owing to the rivalry of Jizan. But further Sa’udi reinforcements, including some armed cars, reached Jizan overland as soon as benzine was available in the Hejaz, and the situation began to stabilize. 46. On the 20th September, the Hejazi Government received from the Imam Yahya by post the “very beautiful” reply which had been promised in a, brief telegram received in August. It proved to be cjmte unintelligible, written in the cryptic style which the late Sherif Husain used to baffle treaty negotiators.' On the 24th, however, he clearly accepted Ibn Sa-ud’s proposal to appoint delegates to meet near Arwa, agree and delimit a frostier, and set up a modus vivendi. They began to meet about the middle of October. 47 . An illuminating sidelight was later thrown by Mr. Philby on Ibn Sa’ud’s attitude of early September. When the news of the advance of the Imam’s troops in the mountains reached Riadh, the King and he and Yusuf Yasin pored over large-scale maps to determine the extent of the jurtri^ggiou, but nobody knew where the frontiei lay. Ibn Sa ud was29 nevertheless bent upon lanuching a sweeping desert attack upon Ban’a from the North-East, a providential means of employing the Nejdi brethren who lay camped round kiadh. No arguments appeared to deter him, when he suddenly changed his mind completely and ordered his outposts in Asir to avoid all contact with the Yemenis. His Majesty’s Government's message thus seems to have been effective, though Mr. Philby was and still is ignorant of it and has given as his opinion that any such message would do more harm than good. * III. RELATIONS WITH STATES OUTSIDE ARABIA. 48. British Empire. —The Hejazi Government’s relations with His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom remained normal. The Trans-Jordan frontier produced its usual quota of matters in dispute (see paragraphs 25 to 38). With regard Iraq, Ibn Saud raised'one small point of concern to himself (see paragraph 39). Matters affecting Kowait and Bahrain were discussed in London and are recorded in paragraph 42. 49. On the 18th September His Majesty’s Chargd d’Affaires forwarded to India for signature,, two English-Arabic copies of the revised Money Order Agreement between the Indian and Hejazi Post Offices, signed by the Hejazi Post Master General. 50. British personnel in the Hejaz Air Force is dealt with in para graphs 62 to 67. The Hejazi Government’s theft of Shell benzine from Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co., has been described in paragraph 5. 51. International. —In consequence of a letter dated the 14th Septem ber from the Hejaz-Nejd Minister in London to the League of Nations, the Council of the League resolved to invite the “Government of the Hejaz to the 1932 Disarmament Conference. The Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs informed His Majesty’s Chargd d’Affaires of the invitation with some gratification. He added that it had not yet been decided whether to accept it or not. On being asked on what grounds the Hejazi Government might decline, he confided how extremely difficult it would be to render a true return of the armed forces of the Hejaz-Nejd and the expenditure thereon. Everv Amir, big and little, had an armed retinue of some sort— and there was ™ such thing as a budget in the country. Moreover his French was weak, and the League had sent him masses of documents m French. 52 Treaties. —In October the Hejazi Government communicated to His Majestv’s Legation a collection of treaties and agreements concluded to date bv Nejd and the He.jaz-Nejd with their neighbours and foreign powers. A list of these instruments is annexed. 53 . France. —The Treaty negotiations still continued. 54. Italy. —The treaty negotiations were stayed. The Italian Consul returned to Jedda on the 11th October with instructions to take no further step forward so long as there existed discord and the possibility of hostili ties between Ibn Baud and the Imam Yahya (see paragraphs 43 to 4/). 55 The Netherlands. —For lack of funds the Secretary-Elect to the Hejaz-Nejd Legation at the Hague has been unable to proceed to his post (July- August Report, paragraph 59). The failure of the Hejaz-Nejd negotiations for a Dutch loan and its aftermath have been reported in para graph 4. ^ &lt; 56. Egypt. —The Egyptian Consul, Hafiz Amer Bey, went on leave of absence on the 10th September. A place-man of Emm \ehia Pasha, the Alexandria shipowner and brother of the Egyptian Minister for Foreign Affairs, he was expected to spend his leave m trying to arrive with their help at some understanding between the Egyptian and Hejazi Government before the next pilgrimage. L805(C)FAPD57. Soviet Russia .—The Soviet Minister and Dean of the Diplomatic Corps at Jedda, Nezir Bey Turakoulov, left on the 11th October for six months leave of absence. His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires gained the im pression that his eventual return would depend upon such progress as might be made in the Soviet negotiations for the entry of their goods into this country, where they are still more or less banned. 58. Comrade Horace Salkind arrived in Jedda on the 1st of September and on the Minister’s departure became Charge d’Affaires per interim. 59. The first consignment of Soviet benzine, contracted for by the Hejazi Government in August, put in a tardy appearance on the 20th Oc tober (see paragraph 14). 60. United States of America. —Mr. Crane’s engineer, Mr. Twitched, arrived for development work on October 19th (see paragraph 17). 61. Turkey .—The new Turkish Chargd d’Affaires, Lutfullah Bey, arrived in Jedda on the 5th September, but the presentation of his creden tials was held up for two months by the state of his pancreas. IV. AIR MATTERS. 62. Hejaz Air Force. —Mr. Lowe, the last of the four British pilots and six mechanics selected by the Ministry in 1929 for Ibn Saud’s new air force, was eventually got rid of in September. As already reported (July- August Report, paragraph 67) he had re-engaged himself on August 24th under a clandestine contract with the Director-General of Military Affairs. When required for work at the aerodrome at the beginning of September however, he reported sick with ear trouble. He was treated as a malingerer and publicly insulted by the Turkish corporal, his contractor. He sought the assistance of His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires on the 6th September. Mr. Hope Gill took up the matter with Taif and as a result learned on the 8 th that the Hejazi Government had decided to cancel the new contract. This was both legal and acceptable, but another ten days were spent in somewhat acrimonious debate before getting the local police surveillance raised (it had been imposed by Hamdi Bey to prevent Mr. Lowe’s departure from the country) and before extracing this now distraught pilot from the toils of the enquiry which followed the crash of a machine on September 13th (see paragraph 6). He was got away, with his arrears of pay, on September 20 th, incontinently declaring for reasons known only to himself that he would return in three months. There w«s unfeigned relief in both British and Hejazi circles at this final liquidation of the unsuitable 1929 personnel. 63. Conversations continued meanwhile concerning new personnel for the air force. Referring to the memorandum which had been communi cated to the Hejazi Government on July 7th (July-August Report, para graph 68), the Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs on the 1st of Septem ber answered the three subsidiary points then raised by His Majesty’s Minister. He stated that he had referred all three points to Ibn Sa’ud, who had replied uncompromisingly that (1) matters of discipline were of purely Hejazi concern; (2) he could not permit any arrangement whereby the new personnel might procure alocoholic liquor; and (3) the question of failure to pay salaries when due did not arise, since the terms of the con tract would be faithfully observed. The first and third of these answers were somewhat softened by Fuad Bey who promised to reply shortly to the memorandum itself. Meanwhile the events described in paragraph 13 supervened. 64. Instead of making a written reply, Fuad Bey gave His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires a message on the 19th September from Ibn Sa’ud to His Majesty’s Government, to the effect that he would like to know how soon new personnel could be sent out, and that he regarded the option enjoyed by the previous personnel, to resign in the event of wmr, as incompatible31 M * « * t 4 ♦ I . . with his present need (that of bombing the Imam Yahya, no doubt); he therefore asked for its omission from the new contracts. Fuad Bey also asked that, in view of the urgency of the matter,, the new contracts, modi fied from the old in the above sense only, be sent to Jedda with the new personnel, for signature on arrival. 65. In transmitting this message to His Majesty’s Government, His Majesty’s Chargd d’Afiaires summarised the situation which underlay it. As far as could be judged at Jedda, Ibn Sa’ud was simultaneously faced by a state of lawlessness and disaffection in the northern Hejaz, the possibility of a resurrection of the Rashidi power at Flail, dissatisfaction through out Nejd at stricter taxation in place of the customary largesse, insurrec tion in Asir abetted and utilized by the Imam Yahya, and latent but bitter hosility in the towns of the Hejas. If this maximum estimate were to be discounted by half Ibn Sa’ud was still faced with a formidable situation, to meet which he had unimpaired military prestige, much impaired political prestige, less Wahhabi fervour to back him, and no money. If he could at once have two pilots with full power to use them as he wished, it would assist him but it could hardly prove decisive, except perhaps to frighten the Imam into terms. Their effect on his subjects everywhere else could not fail to be less than the effect of his four new aeroplanes in 1929, when the Nejdi rebels had been driven into a corner and the weight of His Majesty’s Government, whiich the tribes discerned behind Ibn Sa’ud, was concentrated in one district. Only two machines in any case were now serviceable, while a third might be made serviceable, given time, which would be grudged. A further consideration was that Ibn Sa’ud no longer figured in the Moslem press as the popular consolidator of Arabia. Once suspected of having his back to the wall, the press might well turn on him and feature his pilots as hired assassins, with unfortunate results in India; while if they were to fall into rebel hands, there would be far less hope of their deriving protection from their British . nationality than there might have been in the 1929 operations near both the ’Iraq frontier and the Royal Air Force. Over against all these lay the consideration that Ibn Sa’ud would probably regard any delay or failure on the part of His Majesty’s Government to send out the new personnel, which he so badly needed, as evidence that they were no longer inclined to give him their support and assistance, just when these were most requir ed. Fuad Bey had stated that he could not believe that the British Govern ment, with their wide powers and great experience, could fail to devise the means of helping so loyal and useful a friend as Ibn Sa’ud. 66 . His Majesty’s Government nevertheless replied to Ibn Sa’ud’s message that in no circumstances could they agree to British personnel tak ing part in hostilities against another power; the option to resign in the event of war must therefore be maintained and would be exercised if neces sary. As regards the contracts, these must be agreed before the personnel were engaged. Draft contracts were sent to His Majesty’s Charge d’ffaires for submission to the Heiazi Government if they still desired the early engagement of personnel under the above condition. 67. Ibn Sa’ud professed to be much grieved by this reply which His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires communicated to the Hejazi Government on the 30th September. He assured His Majesty’s Government that his intentions were purely pacific, but he did not deny the fact that he needed his air force to meet both internal rebellion and external agression. He complained that the 1929,, personnel had not been worth the money spent on them. He now found it necessary to punish “certain subjects and asked His Majesty’s Government to choose one of two courses, either send out sufficient new personnel for four machines, to be under his orders for every purpose or else send only instructional personnel and mechanics, and he would himself look for his pilots elsewhere; he would use the British for training and the rest for war. An interim reply was given on the32 1 st November to the effect that Ibn Sa’ud’s proposals presented difficulties but were receiving urgent consideration by His Majesty’s Government. As has been described earlier in this report, the situation has meanwhile im proved considerably. V. Military Matters. 68 . Northern Hejaz .—The poverty and misrule at the seat of Govern ment described in the opening paragraphs of this report were severely felt in the northern Amirates. The Amir of Qaryat al Milh, Ibn ’Abdul Wahid, was reported to have received no pay since June. Ibn Sa’ud’s Controller of Beduin, Sheykh ’Abdul ’Aziz Ibn Zeyd, and his fifty men had had no pay since February. At Jauf the Amir Turki as-Sudairi went in fear that his troops would mutiny for the same reason, and his difficulties were increased by the presence of numbers of unemployed soldiery of the recent an-Neshmi rdgime. His cousin at Tabuk, the Amir ’Abdullah as- Sudairi, was also reported to be experiencing serious trouble with his garrison, who refused to wear uniform or to clean 1 their barracks. In addi- tion there was typhoid at Tabuk and no medical assistance. Further more there was no more benzine, so that frontier patrols could no longer be made. Nevertheless there was no raiding into Trans-Jordan during Sep tember and October. 69. East {Nejd ).—Ibn Sa’ud’s presence attracted large number of tribal visitors to Riadh but no military movements of note were remarked. Reports from Jerusalem state that it was rumoured in October that the Herb and Shammar were to be concentrated at Jauf, which King Faisal in terpreted as a threat against the pipe-line and railway surveys then work ing in near-by ’Iraqi territory but which, if true, was more likely to indi cate contemplated Neidi action against the unruly tribes of the northern Hejaz (July-August Report, paragraph 73). 70. South {Asir ).—The course of the threat of war on the Yemen fron tier of Asir has been reported in paragraphs 43 to 47. VI. NAVAL MATTERS. 71. Naval Visits .—In view of the situation in the Hejaz, and after an exchange of views with His Majesty’s Chargd d’Affaires, Captain Dicken, Senior Naval Officer Red Sea Sloops, postponed the scheduled departure of His Majesty’s Sloop “Lupin” from Port Sudan from the 16th to the 21st of September. A visit to Jedda*was not found necessary, however. His Majesty’s Sloop “Dahlia” (Commander A. R. Farquhar) paid a routine visit to Jedda from the 23rd to the 26th October. The situation was then normal again and several hundred Jed'dawis, mostly uninvited, attended a cricket match between the ship and the British Colony. The usual cour tesy visits were exchanged between the Captain and the Governor of Jedda, who received his salute of thirteen guns. Both were entertained at dinner at the Legation. 72. There were no naval visits by foreign warships. 73. Search for Arms .—As a result of further inter-departmental con sultation on the subject of naval search for arms in the Red Sea (see July- August, 1930 Report, section 35) the following instructions were commu nicated by His Majesty’s Government on the 2nd September:— Prevention of Illicit Traffic in Arms and Ammunition. The Arms Traffic Convention of the 17th June, 1925, is not in force. Nevertheless, in taking steps for the Prevention of the illicit traffic in arms by native vessels, the procedure laid down in this Convention should be fol lowed. By this Convention, H. M. Ships have the right only to “verify the flag” in native vessels under 500 tons which fly the flag of one of the parties to the Convention. Under this Convention, if no authority to flythe flag is forthcoming, or if, in spite of such authority, strong suspicion still exists that the vessel is carrying on illicit traffic in arms and ammuni tion, she may be conducted to the nearest port of the Power whose flag was flown. No right of search is given by the Convention. 2 . By custom native vessels within the Red Sea may be searched for arms outside the territorial waters of French and Italian colonies, what ever flag they may be flying. In view, however, of the absence of specific legal sanction for carrying out searches for arms in the Red Sea, it is of importance that all searches should be ostensibly for slaves and not for arms. Searches in the territorial waters of the Hejaz proper as distinct from Asir, i.e., north of Dahban, should be conducted with great discre tion and should not take place at all in the vicinity of important ports If a native vessel is found to be carrying a greater number of arms than is necessary for the normal crew, it may be assumed that, in the absence of a special license, that they are doing so illegally and any rifles or pistols (but not swords or daggers) in excess of this number should be confiscated, but in the case of a dhow which would prove Hejazi or Asiri origin no action should be taken in the territorial waters of the Hejaz proper (as distinct from Asir), i.e., north of Dahban. 3. If any considerable quantity of arms is found on board, or if there is a strong suspicion that the vessel is engaged in illegal traffic in arms or ammunition, the procedure laid down In Annex II, Section IT of the Arms Traffic Convention is to be carried out in the case of vessels /Ring the flag of one of the signatories t6 that Convention or flving no flag. Sub ject to the provisions of paragraph 2 above, native vessels flying the flag of a country that is not a signatory should be taken to Aden. 4. Special agreements regarding the right of search for arms remain in force with Italy and Muscat. 5. It is the custom of the governments of the various divisions of Arabia which border on the Red Sea to arm small vessels from time to time, for the protection of their respective shipping, and the repression of smug gling. Such vessels should of course not be interfered with. VII. PILGRIMAGE. 74. 1931 Pilgrimage Report. —A very detailed and consequently some what bulky pilgrimage report on the 1931 season was compiled in the Le gation in September and despatched on the 29th. The local pilgrimage conditions had showed no improvement on those of the previous year. The best that could be said for Ibn Sa’fld was that he had maintained security; the worst, that the inefficiency and corruption of his Moslem Arab regime in the Holy Places continued increasingly to contrast with the care bestow ed on pilgrims by the infidel powers. 75. Nigerian Pilgrim Destitutes .—In September it was calculated that there were some five hundred Nigerians destitute in Jedda without means to return to Africa and without sufficient work to support themselves in the Hejaz (see July-August Report, paragraph 80). As there was no prospect of their being able to find employment for many months to come, the Legation was faced with the necessity of arranging for their repatria tion to the East Coast of Africa, whence they might work their way as usual across the continent. On the 6th October His Majesty’s Chargd d’Affaires addressed the Sudan authorities in this sense and enquired whe ther special arrangements could be made to admit these destitutes at Suakin, without payment of the usual quarantine dues, and either to absorb them in the local labour market or alternatively to entrain them for dis tricts in or beyond the Sudan where their labour could be utilized and whence they could work their way homeward ill the traditional fashion. No reply was received by the end of the month. More destitutes mean while began to arrive from the interior, where poverty was even more acute than in Jedda. i■ 34 VIII. SLAVERY. 76. Slave Trade. —Also as a result of the inter-departmental consult- tation referred to in paragraph 73, the following instructions in regard to searches for slaves in the Red Sea were issued by His Majesty’s Govern ment on September 2nd : — Suppression of Slave Trade, There is no longer any general Convention in force according the right of search for slaves, but the Convention of the 10th September, 1919, re vising the General Acts of Berlin (1885) and of Brussels (1890), states that the signatories (U. S. A., Belgium, British Empire, France, Italy, Japan, Portugal) will endeavour to secure the complete suppression of slavery in all its forms, and of the slave trade by land and sea. It can also be* argued that the obligations of the General Act of 1890 still apply to countries who were parties to it but not of the 1919 Convention, and therefore to Turkey and the States who have succeeded her. The latter would, however, pro- bably refuse to admit this. A further legal basis of a similar kind could possibly be found in the Anglo-Turkish Treaty of 1881 for the suppression of the African slave trade. A more definite legal basis in respect of Hejazi, Asiri and Nejdi vessels is provided by Article 7 of the Treaty of Jedda in 1927 in which Ibn Sa’ud undertook “to co-operate by all the means at his disposal with His Britannic Majesty in the suppression, of the slave trade”. 2. Treaties are still in force under which H. M. Ships can search vessels of the following countries for slaves, viz., Borneo,, Egypt (vessels under 500 tons), Italy, Liberia, Muscat, Persia, Spain (vessels under 500 tons), and Bahrain and the Trucial Sheikdoms Abu Dhabi, Babai, Shargah, Ajman, Um-al-Qaiwain and Ras-al-Khaima). 3. By custom, however, native vessels within the Red Sea may be searched for slaves outside the territorrial waters of French and Italian colonies whatever flag they may be flying. Searches in the territorial waters of the Hejaz proper (as distinct from Asir), i e., north of Dahban, should, however, be conducted with great discretion and should not take place at all in the vicinity of important ports. 4 . Care must also be taken to avoid giving offence to the French and Italian authorities by undue restraint on dhows legitimately sailing under their colours. The authority to fly the flag should be carried by the dhow. 5. Search must always be carried out in the manner laid down in the Slave Trade Instructions, Vol. I. 6. The main traffic in slaves is believed to cross from the African to the Arabian shore in the narrower waters at the Southern end of Red Sea, proceeding thence up the Arabian coast, inside the islands and reefs as far as possible, to the trading ports. 7. Runaway Slaves. —The Arabs regard slaves as recognised servants, and to give refuge to runaways is liable to cause great irritation. On the other hand, it is against British principles to refuse these peoples refuge. Commanding Officers are. therefore, to consult British Consular or Pchti- c a l representatives in Arabia as soon as possible as to action to be taken. 77 Manumissions. —One Abyssinian woman was manumitted locally in September by agreement with'her owner. Two male slaves took refuge in the Legation in October; one left of his own accord to work for himself, the other, a Sudani, was repatriated to Suakin. IX.

The occasion is taken of repeating the information that the spelling Jedda is consecrated by Foreign Office usage. It is moreover convenient that' a place where His Majesty’s Government maintain a Legation should be known in official English by a fixed name. Some other posts still seem to find it difficult to reconcile the spelling Jedda with their philological prin ciples. If these can finally be overcome, it will be much appreciated at Jedda. ' N w i * t * L10 8 1(C) F&amp;PDI. INTERNAL AFFAIRS. Ibn Sa'ud .—The King continued in Riadh throughout November and December, but he was no longer able to brood on his personal troubles; there came home to roost in Nejd the troublesome offspring of union with the Hejaz. The last two reports have described the process of further disinte gration which the already rotten state of the Hejaz passed through alter Ibn Sa’ud’s withdrawal into Nejd in June. In the first days of November he had before him at Riadh a memorandum on the situation drawn up by his son Feysal, the Viceroy, and Fuad Bey Hamza, his Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs. These had at length revolted against the virtual dictator ship of his henchman and Director-General of Finance, Sheykh ’Abdullah Suleyman, who had to go to Riadh to give his ow n account of his stewardship. The memorandum revealed dissension in the Government of the Hejaz amounting to deadlock and a critical state of financial chaos. It prescribed two remedies which His Majesty had never yet l&gt;een able to stomach, a budget and a “Cabinet”. He now however accepted both, with what difficulty is not known, and sent his chief political adviser, Sheykh Yusuf Yasin, to Jedda with a proclamation and to concert financial measures with Fuad Hamza. ’Abdullah Suleyman he retained in Nejd until the trouble should blow over. 2 . Reforms .—On November 3rd the Hejaz was shocked by the news that by direct order of the King the Treasury and all its branches were to be closed and the tills locked, and that no payments however small were to be made pending further instructions. This was the first sign of Ibn Sa’ud’s reaction to the situation. Its inconveniences were manifold, for all daily- paid public and municipal work at once ceased and the Quarantine Depart ment, for instance, had to borrow fuel for its launch in order to 'function at all., 3. Late on November 12th, Yusuf Yasin arrived posthaste in Jedda, where the Amir Feysal and Fuad Hamza were awaiting him to learn the King’s decisions. On the following morning His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires was invited to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to receive the welcome news of financial and constitutional reform. The latter, he was given to understand, was not yet elaborated, but the King had conceded the principle of a Council of Ministers on whom would rest joint responsibility for government in addition to individual responsibility for their depart ments. The resulting decree, which was not published until January, falls to be considered in the next report. As to financial reform, Yusuf Yasin and F’uad Hamza were in a position to announce the establishment of a budget. 4. They told Mr. Hope Gill in confidence that the revenue would be in future apportioned under four headings 35 per cent official salaries, intended to cover all normal costs of admi nistration ; 25 per cent., indebtedness, to cover all arrears of salaries as well as the Government’s internal and external debt; 15 per cent., reserve (a novelty with all the attraction of a pot of honey); and 25 per cent., extraordinary expenses, intended to ensure the comfort and health of pilgrims and to develop the country’s hidden resources. Even approximate figures of estimated revenue were not yet available, but it had been calculated that current indebtedness could be met in abo^t two years. There Sheykh Yusuf’s information stopped and he left to say his prayers. Nevertheless it was gratifying to learn of even the birth of a budget. L1081(C) FiPD ]J 5. On the same day the “Umm-al-Qura” published a long proclamation by the King to his people announcing the information contained in the pre ceding paragraph but omitting the percentages, establishing the principle that all creditors must stand on an equal footing and forecasting with pious hope the beneficial results that would flow from the policy of retrenchment and development which had now been adopted. Further communiques pub lished in subsequent issues announced the King’s commands to reduce expen diture, to select a Reorganisation Committee, to create a Treasury Depart ment and to appoint a Treasurer, and meanwhile to employ the Director- General of Finance and the Vice-President of the Hejaz Legislative Assem bly in an inspectional tour of the other side of Nejd (whence they had not returned by the end of December). The King’s personal expenditure was also to be reduced, for which the “Umm-al-Qura” gave him loyal praise. 6 . Although the budget, or what passes in this country as a budget, was not published until January 15th, it may conveniently be dealt with here. It took the from of a badly worded decree in six articles and a list of items of expenditure which do not add up correctly; a translation is attached as an appendix to this report. The budget thus resolves itself into an estimate of expenditure under various heads which do not seem to corre spond with the percentage allotments previously communicated. The decree states that the revenue equals this expenditure, but no detail is given and no mention is made of the reserve fund. Nor is it stated whether the budget applies to the Hejaz only or to the whole of Ibn Sa’ud’s domi nions. As soon as budgetary reform was announced, it was generally held to have come too late. Now that the details have been published, pessimism is confirmed. Fuad Bey himself seems to have no illusions as to the un certainty of the revenue prospects., 7. One other point emerging from the budget discussions has been that the financial capital will in future be Jedda instead of Mecca. The idea of supplementing the reform by the employment of a European financial adviser is still canvassed and the post is said to have been offered to the local Manager of the Dutch Bank, Mr. Jacobs, and also to another Dutchman, Mr. van Leeuwe. Nothing definite has transpired, however. 8 . Ministry of Foreign Affairs .—The Amir Feysal, Viceroy and Minister, moved his Government and Department back to Mecca on ’Nov- ember 6th from Taif, whither he had removed them on July 6th for the summer. On November 7th his Under-Secretary informed the foreign re presentatives that the Jedda office of the Ministry had been transferred (from the flat which it occupied in the offices of an Italian shipping agent and for which, incidentally, it has failed to pay the agreed rent) to a sepa rate building of its own. This has meant nothing more than a welcome change of environment, which will make it no longer necessary for the Under secretary to speed his parting visitors through al fresco macaroni parties on the stairways. The new office, however, is just as vacant as the old. Personal contact with the foreign representatives at Jedda, which it had been hoped a year ago (December 1930 Report, paragraph 1) would become more frequent, is as rare as ever and heads of foreign missions are becoming- restive and increasingly critical of their isolationist treatment. 9. Fuad Bey came to Jedda on the 29th October and left on the 3rd November. On the 1st he gave His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires a 3-hour interview. He returned on the 7th to await the Minister for Foreign Affairs who came on the 9th, signed a Treaty with France on the 10th. and left on the 13th. They were joined on the 12th by Sheykh Yusuf Yasin, hot foot with' the reforms from Riadh, and Mr. Hope Gill had a further inter view with Fuad Bey which was attended by the Sheykh. They both left Jedda on the 14th November. Yusuf Yasin returned to Riadh on the 2nd December, and Fuad Hamza, after a flying visit to Jedda on December 4th- 6 th, followed him there on the 15th, the day on which His Majesty's Minister arrived. He was not seen again until January. 4 * « -4 t • * *3 10. Financial Situation .—The general financial position at the close of the year was as gloomy as the economic (see paragraph 17). The reform scheme, if it had not come too late, had no one capable of running it ration ally. The Treasurer, for example, is a bankrupt of 35. Nor were the prospects of revenue brighter. A pilgrimage from overseas of 20,000, or half the number of the meagre 1931 pilgrimage, was all that could now be expected; and each year’s pilgrims were bringing less money. The customs revenues showed a continued decline, due to decreased pilgrimage and gen eral depression. For the lunar year ended in June 1929 they were believed to have ranged round the million mark; for that ending next May they seem unlikely to exceed half a million sterling. With this decreased security, * * with increasing uncertainty as to the stability of the Sa’udian regime, and following on the breakdown of the negotiations with the Dutch Bank (July- August Report, paragraph 9), the prospects of a development loan being obtained on commercial lines from any European country have receded out • * of sight. Relations with Soviet Russia, which alone might engage in trade, or even finance, on uneconomic lines, remained obscure. A consignment of J** 42,000 cases of Russian kerosine arrived at Yanbu’ and Jedda on November 26th, in fulfilment of the July contract (July-August Report, paragraph 10), and Russian matches were also on sale; but big business between the two Governments seemed out of the question. The ‘‘prohibition of Soviet merchandise was maintained. 11 . The sterling crisis of September had at first no direct effect on the currency of the Hejaz, which is based on the gold sovereign actually in cir culation and not on sterling as such. By November, however, one notice able effect became evident in the lessened volume of gold in circulation, pro bably owing to hoarding and to heavy purchases of gold made by the local Dutch Bank. English and Egyptian notes came into increasing use, the former possibly on account of the Soviet Legation, which has no local bank ing account and meets its liabilities with English bank-notes imported by bag. * 12. The silver riyal had been depreciating steadily since February and in the first fortnight of November sank to a rate which fluctuated between 18 and 20 to the gold £. Attempts made by the King to bolster it up by popularising its use in Nejd, by the setting up of a net work of retail stalls, stocked with “borrowed” Hejazi goods, in which riyals alone were accepted, were frustrated by the attitude of the Nejdi merchants, who complained that the riyal was useless to them for transactions in Kuwait and Bahrain A anc i refused to deal in them. The gold value of the riyal in Nejd is said to have been as low as 30. In the Hejaz the Government themselves had Ion 0, since ceased to attach any value to the so-called ^ official rate of Rivals 10 = £1 gold, except in so far as they secured their acceptance at this rate when making payments wherever they could. Early in October they had made their first definite admission that the riyal had depreciated by , &gt; insisting that customs dues, which are fixed in Piastres Miri at the rate of Piastres Miri 110 = Riyals 10 = £1 gold, should be paid either in gold or by an equivalent number of riyals at the market, as opposed to the official, rate This rule was now extended to other classes of payments. In the , a uncertainty which followed the departure of ’Abdulla Suleyman to Riadh (September-October Report, paragraph 10) the riyal seemed likely to fall to the value of its silver content, about 24 to the gold £. Bv the end of D^c- ember, however, under the influence of the events described in the precedins: paragraphs, it had recovered to about and 12^ to the gold and paper £ respectively. 13 No Government indebtedness was reduced during November and December, with the notable exception that the Eastern Telegraph Company received three remittances, totalling some £1,450, in respect of their long- outstanding account. Despite this, the debit Hejazi account amounted to some £2 000 at the end of December. Official salaries were for the most part six months in arrear on December 12th, from which date the budget isto operate. It is however, the declared intention of the Government to lump these arrears with the general floating debt, which it is hoped to pay off in the next two years. Inface of the penury of all classes of officials, this arrange ment has not made any wide appeal. 14. Throughout the autumn the Legation received a stream of com plaints from British and British Protected motor-car drivers, mostly Somalis, who had been attracted to the country during the 1931 pilgrimage season by the high wages offered by certain Government-controlled motor companies but who, on being discharged after the season, had been quite unable to obtain the balances due to them. The claims, where they appeared genuine, were forwarded to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but, although the Government’s liability was not contested, no claim was settled up till the end of the year and in only two cases were the men able to make even sacrificial arrangements with the companies. In most cases the drivers were reduced to beggary and had to be repatriated by the Legation. 15. The Government of India debt is dealt with in paragraph 44 and that due to Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey &amp; Co., in paragraph 45. 16. In November His Majesty’s Government were approached by the Ottoman Debt Council with the proposal that they, in conjunction with the other Government signatories of the Treaty of Lausanne, should make joint representations to the Hejaz-Nezd Government in the matter of the shares of the Ottoman public debt due by the latter. It appeared that the Hejaz- Nejd Government, invited by the council to settle their quota of the debt, had replied on September 29th, refusing point-blank to recognize any res ponsibility or to take any action in the matter. This can hardly be re garded as surprising. His Majesty’s Government had earlier in the year been approached by the French Government with a similar proposal of the Council in respect of the European Governments who were similiarly debtors, and had replied that while they agreed in principle to the proposal, they considered the moment inopportune for the purpose. No further action was accordingly taken in this instance, a formal acknowledgment only being sent to the Council. 17. Economic Situation .—It was generally felt, at the end of the year, that the economic situation could har41y have been worse. The merchants of Jedda and Mecca had for the past two years been increasingly hard hit, not only by trade depression but by the ever-growing volume of forced loans,’ without material prospect of repayment, extorted from them by. the Govern ment in the guise of Sheykh ’Abdullah Suleyman. To this was now added the uncertainty produced by monetary crises elsewhere. Prices of imported goods had risen considerably; and as most of the necessaries of life are imported, living was appreciably dearer. Amongst the tribes, particularly in the Northern Hejaz, the utmost misery was reported. Their livestock, especially camels, have been seriously depleted by Government requisitions for military purposes; and they have been compelled by necessity to sell off much of what remained at heavy losses. Tales of famine were rife, although stories of Beduin dying of starvation by the hundred were doubt less exaggerated. It became impossible, however, to discount the con tinuous reports of hunger and increased mortality received from all sources and all directions. &lt; 18. Economic Development. —Mr. Twitchejl has shown great activity. He first installed his American prospector, Mr. Moseley, near Taif, where he remained during November and December prospecting for gold, with results so far unknown. Mr. Twitchell then resumed work on the Waziria Wells near Jedda (September-October Report, paragraph 16). The American windmill pump was erected and by mid-December was producing a regular flow of water, which at one time found its way through the old Turkish conduit to Jedda. His success stopped there, for the conduit deve loped serious leaks and the authorities shrank from the expenditure neces sary to recondition it. By the end of December the hoped-for flow of water5 into the town had still not been attained. On December 15th, Mr. Twitched departed on an extended tour through Nejd under the King’s auspices to investigate potential supplies of minerals and water. His wife remained at Jedda in charge of the windmill and certain water-seeking operations which had been started in the neighbourhood with the aid of a hand-drill. 19. Customs Duties .—An official communique of November 10th, announced the levying as from that date of additional customs duties on benzine, kerosine, sugar, tobacco and cigarette paper, and matches. 20 . Wireless Installation .—No further instalments of payment were made by the Hejazi Government (September-October Report, paragraph 18), and at the end of December payment was 5 months in arrear. Some pro gress in installation was made. The “Umm-al-Qura” of November 20th, reported that the station at Hail was now in communication with Taif, Mecca and Medina. This, however, would appear to be an original Turkish plant, since, according to Marconi’s engineer, no work at all had as yet been done at Hail. On December 4th, it was announced that the Tabuk station was working as from November 28th, thus confirmning a pre vious report. Mr. Boucicault, who had completed it, was at the end of December still detained through lack of stores and benzine at Tabuk, where famine was reported to be increasing. The main Riadh station had not been begun by the end of December, partly owing to the opposition of the Nejdi Ulama, who objected to wireless as. an invention of the devil and had to be silenced by a royal harangue reinforced by a squad of soldiery. The old Turkish' installation at Jauf has been removed to Skaka, the new headquarters of the district Amir. Mr. Boucicault had intended to erect a new Marconi station at Jauf, but it is learned that Ibn Sa’ud now wants him to proceed to the Hasa first. There is a difference of opinion however as to who should pay his travelling expenses. 21. Legislation .—His Majesty’s Minister had in July drawn the atten tion of His Majesty’s Government to a Hejazi regulation published the previous February, under the terms of which writs issued by foreign courts for use in the Hejaz had apparently to be legalised first by the British Legation at Jedda and then by the Hejazi Minister for Foreign Affairs, and had suggested that the seals and signatures of all courts or officials in British territory, which might be accepted for the purpose, should be com municated to him. The Government of India was requested by the India Office on the 4th November to act in this sense and the Governments of certain Colonies, Protectorates and Mandated Territories were similarly addressed by the Colonial Office on November 20th. 22. Communications .—Early in November His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires questioned the Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs as to the reported proposal to start a motor-service on the old pilgrim route from Najaf to Medina (September-October Report, paragraph 21). Fuad Bey confirmed that the ’Iraq Government had enquired as to the route from Najaf through Jduf and Taima to Medina and had been told that it was impracticable for cars between Jauf and Taima on account of the soft sands of the Nafud desert. He added that the Hejaz-Nejd Government were now studying the possibilities of the old direct route, the “Darb Zubeyda”. from Najaf through Hail to Medina; but that there was no truth in the report that the King would shortly travel to Hail to inaugurate it. 23. The “Umm-al-Qura” of November 11th published a long article entitled “Moslem Routes” Eight routes, it stated, were formerly used by pilgrims on their way to the Holy Cities, namely the routes of Syria (from Damascus), of Egypt, of Aden, of San’a, of ’Oman, of al Ahsa, of Basra, and of Bagdad (the Darb Zubeyda); but most of these had been abandoned of recent years in favour of the sea-routes to Jedda. The Government were now examining a project to open a motor-route from ’Iraq via Najaf, al Huzun, and J&amp;uf, an ’Iraqi company running motor-services as far as J&amp;uf and a Hejazi company running a corresponding service on from Jauf to Mecca and Medina. A route from Jauf to Hail and Medina was also L1081(C) F&amp;PD jbeing considered. Subsequent articles intimated that the Government bad received many applications for permission to open a road from Syria to Jauf, which they were studying; and that over 2,000 pilgrims were expected this year to travel overland from ’Iraq, though it was not yet settled which route would be used. 24. The October number of the “Oriente Moderno” also mentioned the project of a motor-route from Syria and ’Iraq via Najaf, stating that Syrian, Persian and ’Iraqi pilgrims would be able to use it and thus escape the vexatious Syrian and Egyptian quarantine regulations. An ’Iraqi company would probably obtain the concession to run motor-services on the route, in preference to the British company which was said to be applying. 25. The Hejaz Railway .—The Moslem Congress held at Jerusalem on December 6th to 16th formed a Committee to study and report on the vexed question of the Hejaz Railway. The Committee’s report was neither accurate nor profound. The discussion of it was too inflamed to be serious The following resolution was finally adopted : — After hearing the report of the Committee on the Hejaz Railway and perusing the documents relating thereto, the Congress declares its resentment of the usurption of Moslem property, which is essentially a Wakf. The Congress should approach Islamic and other Governments in this regard and should empower the Executive Committee to discuss other means for the re covery of this line. 26 It remains to be seen what action, if any, Ibn Sa’ud will take. 27. Moslem Congress at Jerusalem.—On the 14th November, the Under secretary for Foreign Affairs, under urgent instructions from Ibn Sa'ud, requested His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires to ascertain His Majesty’s Government’s attitude towards the proposed Moslem Congress. The Grand Mufti of Palestine, luad Bey said, had invited the Hejazi. Government to send a representative and leading persons, like himself and Sheykh Yusuf Yasin, to attend. He stressed the probable anti-British and patently anti-Sa’udi complexion of the conference and said that the King did not Know whether to stand aloof and suffer the consequences or to send a repre sentative to look after his interests. He did not like the agenda and was confused by the fact of receiving an invitation from a Palestinian Govern ment official. So he relied on a lead from His Majesty’s Government. 28. Fuad Bey was told on the 21st November in reply that His Majesty’s Government regretted that they could not take the responsibility of advis ing Tbn Sa’ud as to whether he should send delegates or not. He might, however, be glad to know that His Majesty’s Government were in no way associated with the proposal to hold the Congress and that it had neither their encouragement nor support. Their attitude was one of detachment, excepting in so far as regarded any possible reaction on public security in Palestine. As for the Grand Mufti, he was no doubt acting as a religious dignitary and not as a Palestinian' official. 29 A week later Fuad Bey was orally informed that, as a result of recent conversations between the High Commissioner for Palestine and the Grand Mufti, His Majesty’s Government did not anticipate that political issues would be raised or that the proceedings of the Congress would cause embarrassment to Ibn Sa’ud’s Government. Moreover the Grand Mufti had given a specific assurance that the Caliphate question would not be raised. Fuad Bey expressed gratitude for this information. 30 In the event, Ibn Sa’ud sent no delegate, his “Umm-al-Qura” suobbed the Congress (although Fuad Hamza sent a message of support), and the only questions inised at Jerusalem which appear to affect Ibn Sa’ud were that of the Hejaz Railway, dealt with in paragraph 25 above; the proposal that a committee be appointed in each Moslem country to raisefunds for the projected University at Jerusalem; and the circulation of a propaganda leaflet entitled “The Voice of Mecca”, denouncing the Sa’udi regime. It may also be noted that the delegates visited the tomb of the late 0 #-King Huseyn and lunched with his son ’Abdullah. Wahhabi ten dencies were displayed at the Congress by Rashid Ridha, an Egyptian, but. met with opposition from the rest. 31. Security. —The only known case affecting internal security conti nued to be that of the Danish Moslem, Knud Holmboe (September-October Report, Paragraph 24). Although informed that the man had definitely not returned to Trans-Jordan and repeatedly pressed, unofficially, for more and accurate information, Fuad Bey only replied that nothing was known of the affair. IT—FRONTIER QUESTIONS. ' I i Trans-Jordan. 32 Raiding. —The Hejazi Government have lately complained of the five following raids said to have been made from Trans-Jordan into Nejd in December:— On December 1st at Kalakh, 25 camels taken; On December 2nd at Rajm an-Na’am, 16 camels taken; On December 8th near Shinam, 60 camels taken; On December 8th at Ar-Raja’a, 25 camels taken; On December 14th at Mudhaibi’a, a caravan taken and 2 men killed. No raid was complained of on the Trans-Jordan side of the frontiei during November and December. 33. Repercussions from the raid of September 28th at Haj (not Hazim. nor Hazm) engaged attention. On the 2nd December the Hejazi Minister for Foreign Affairs stated categorically that the victims, the ’Atun section of the Huweytat, were subjects of Ibn Sa’ud. The Trans-Jordan autho rities, however, claimed them as Trans-Jordan subjects and during the rest of the month past correspondence was examined in an attempt to settle the question, but without final result. 34. Glubb-Ibn Zeyd Meetings. —No meeting was held but preparations were made to hold one early in January. 35. MacDonnell Investigation. —On the 28th November the Hejazi Government replied in these words to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires’ request of the 6th October for the payment of the Hejazi share of the costs of the investigation :—“the agreement, in accordance with the terms of which the arbitration took place, contained the proviso that each party should bear the expenses of the arbitration in proportion to the judgment given against it, but there was no ruling to meet the case of no judgment being given against either party My Government, are surprised that they should be requested to p'ay half the expenses of the arbitration, when they have experienced heavy loss as a result of the reduction of the claims of their subjects”. This Semitic calculation on an arbitral award, which held that the claims of both sides cancelled each other out, was trans mitted to His Majesty’s Government on the 1st December, and when Mr. Hope Gill had occasion, during a telephone conversation with Fuad Bey later in the month, to refer to it in appropriate terms, he received the soft answer that, if the Hejazi Government were pressed to pay, they would probably do so. He advised Fuad Bey that the Hejazi Government would no doubt find it more pleasant to make up their mind and pay without wait ing for His Majesty’s Government’s views on their refusal. They did nothing, however, by the end of December. 36. Aerial Trespass.—On the 1st December, under instructions from His Majesty’s Government, His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires replied to a Heiazi protest made in October to the effect that three British aircraft had violated the Trans-Jordan-Nejd frontier. He explained that one machine had oeeucompelled by engine trouble to land, but that the atmosphere was hazy and the leader ot the formation was therefore doubtful of his exact position; he thought that the landing was made in Trans-Jordan territory. In fact it was made in Nejd territory. Mr. Hope Gill drew attention to the fact that the landing was due to circumstances beyond the pilot’s control and expressed His Majesty’s Government’s regret. In reply of the I2th Decem ber the Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that he found it necessary to draw His Majesty’s Government’s attention to the fact that, although the Hejazi Government were always ready to afford all possible assistance, they could not avoid taking such measures as would leave no room for any in fringement of their regulations or violation of their honour. 37. In transmitting this reply to His Majesty’s Government, His Majesty’s Minister observed that its language reflected the churlish spirit in which the Hejazi Government habitually dealt with questions of this kind. It might almost be construed as a menace, but in view of His Majesty’s Government’s desire to avoid fruitless correspondence over the matter. Sir A. Ryan did not propose to pursue it in writing but would draw Fuad Bey’s attention to the unfriendly tone of the reply on his return from Riadh, He did so in January. Fuad Hamza explained somewhat lamely and obscurely, what he apparently tried to convey was that the note meant that, even if the Hejaz-Nejd Government had to condone a violation of territory, it did not impair their rights. In view however, of the friendly nature of contem porary correspondence about the missing ’Iraqi pilot, Squadron-Leader Warburton, Sir Andrew did not press the matter further. ’Iraq. 38. There is nothing of interest to report, except the death at Riadh in October or early November of the Mutair chieftain Faisal ad-Dawish, once a prominent figure on the ’Iraq frontier and leader of the 1929 rebellion against Ibn Sa’ud. He is said to have died of an internal disorder in the nature of dy sen try. 39 The project of a pilgrim route for cars from ’Iraq to the Hejaz nas been noted in paragraph 22. \ Kuwait and Bahrain. 40. There is nothing definite to report, beyond a certain increased activity on the Kuwait border on the part of Ibn Muhairib, Ibn Sa’ud’s frontier official. Asir and the Yemen. 41 The meeting of Sa’udi and Yemeni delegates referred to in para graph 46 of the last report was held early in November at an-Nadhir near Mount ’Arwa, the place in dispute. Neither side would give way, however, and the matter was referred to their respective Governments. Telegraphic messages were thereupon exchanged between Ibn Sa’ud and the Imam Yahya, as a result of which the latter asked the former to arbitrate. “Wherefore His Majesty”, as the Hejazi proclamation puts it, “wishing the dispute to be settled by peaceful means and bloodshed to be avoided, desirous also of seeing co-operation prevail amongst the Arabs, could not but telegraph to His Highness the Imam giving judgment against himself namelv the surrender of Mount ’Arwa to the Yemen Friendly rela tions have thus been established between His Majesty the King and His Highness the Imam on firm foundations, please God Almighty.” Ibn Sa’ud jnust have felt that circumstances were indeed against him, to induce him to yield ground to the Yemen. I 42. The local pact nevertheless bore fruit. On the '15th December a treaty of friendship, neighbourliness, and extradition was signed at Abu ’Arish between the Hejaz-Nejd and the Yemen. It came as a surprise and is not much believed in. , iIII.—RELATIONS WITH STATES OUTSIDE ARABIA. 43. British Empire. —Relations were normal. They centred round the Trans-Jordan frontier the Hejaz Air Force, and Ibn Sa’ud’s debts. The first-named has been dealt with in paragraphs 32 to 37. Air matters are reported in paragraphs 55 to 60 below. It is convenient to mention the debts here. 44. At the end of his conversation with His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires on the 13th Noveinber (see paragraph 4 above), the Hejazi Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs preferred a request that His Majesty’s Government would allow the 1929 debt of £30,000 owing to the Government of India to be- included in the virtual moratorium and placed on a basis of equality with the wliole of llejazi-Nejd indebtedness. Mr. Hope Gill replied that lie would communicate the request to His Majesty’s Government but that facts and figures would certainly be required. Fuad Bey was in no posi tion, however, to say what the other indebtedness was, either by categorv or in total, but he thought that it would be possible to liquidate it all in 2 years. This meagre information^was telegraphed to London. 45. Mr. Hope Gill then reminded Fuad Bey of the benzine debt of C 13.000 to Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey, &amp; Co., which he insisted could not be deferred but must be paid according to the agreement of September. Fuad Bey took note of this but promised nothing. As regards the current debt to the Eastern Telegraph Company, which was always £2,000 or more, he assured Mr. Hope Gill that all postal and telegraphic receipts would hence- forth be reserved for its liquidation and would not be pooled with the Gov ernmeut's other resources. Mr. Hope Gill made a passing reference to the Hejazi ha If-share of the costs of the MacDonnell investigation, a matter of only £1,70Q. and was promised an early reply (see paragraph 35). He made no reference to the Marconi debt, which, though mounting up and £5,000 high at the turn of the year, is a matter on which neither the Com pany nor Mr. Philby, their agent, has yet approached the Legation. He mentioned, however, the several hundred pounds owing to a number of British and British-protected chauffeurs in Government employ (see paragraph 14). but without drawing more than a sardonic reference to the similar plight of all Government employees in the country. 46. I titer national.* —On November 23rd the Hejaz-Nejd telegraphed to Geneva its adherence to the proposed Armaments Truce. No decision to accept the invitation to attend the Disarmament Conference was notified before the end of the year. j 47. France. —The treaty with France was at last signed on the 10th November, together with an agreement covering relations with Syria. Tne former is the result of nearly 2 years’ negotiation; it is understood to follow the lines of the Treaty of Jedda but to exclude all mention of the suppression of the slave trade, that civilized aim to which His Majesty’s Government had succeeded in binding Ibn Sa’ud—on paper. 48. The Netherlands. —M. Adriaanse returned to Jedda on November 5th and presented his credentials as Charg6 d’Affaires. He had spent a part of his leave acting as Secretary to the Orientalists’ Conference at Leiden, but he finds the local Arabic well-nigh unintelligible. 49. Germany. —M. de Haas went on leave in November, leaving a local German merchant in charge of his Consulate. 50. Soviet Russia. —A second consignment of Soviet oil was delivered at Jedda in November (see paragraph 10). 51. Turkey. —Lutfullah Bey was in November at length able to present his credentials as Charge d’Affaires. His Legation has since been charged with Afghan interests. 52. Persia.^—Ain ul Mulk Habibullah Khan Hoveida once more returned to Jedda, after 6 months’ leave of absenc, on December 26th. 53. United States of America. —The prospecting activities ol Mr. Crane’s engineer are described in paragraph 18. LIOSI C) f&amp;pd i .10 54. Denmark .—There being no Danish representative here. His Majesty’s Government were asked to have enquiries made by the Legation as to the fate of an adventurous Dane, with results that are told in para graph 31. • , i. ] IV.—AIR MATTERS.' ' 55 Ilejaz Air Force Machines .—Following on the crash of one machine (Scptember-October Report, paragraph 6) and the departure of the last British pilot (ibidem paragraph 62), the four Wapitis remained in their hangar throughout November and December. No one was in particular charge of them. The British engineer who looks after the local sea-water condensers was occasionally asked to look at them; he reported that the engines were apparently sufficiently well greased but that the fabric and stays were suffering from moth and rust respectively. The roof of the hangar then fell in; the machines were moved to an adjacent spot where they were kept under lock and key and a cover of cotton sheets. 56. HejazAir Force Personnel.—On November 7th the Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs gave a private hint to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires that if His Majesty’s Government were to propose that a British aviation mission should be sent to the Hejaz, he would be prepared to urge Ibn Sa’ud to accept it. The position, he explained, had changed since the King had refused an offer of even partial assistance in 1927, and Fuad Hamza was now so anxious to avoid the impression of Anglo-Hejazi estrangement which would be given by their engagement of a personnel other than British, that be was ready to act as indicated. He was not in a strong enough position to do more. ' ; 57. To this suggestion, and to the King’s definite proposals reported in paragraph 67 of the September-October Report,,. His Majesty’s Government replied on November 14th. They pointed out firstly, that their willingness to select new personnel for the Hejaz Air Force was based on the Hejazi Government’s proposals of June 17th (May-June Report, paragraph 56), which were superseded by the King’s proposals referred to above. These had been sympathetically considered but could not be accepted. The King’s request that the personnel should be “under his orders for every purpose” could not be complied with-for reasons already stated (September-October Report, paragraph 66, first sentence), while the alternative proposal to engage British personnel for instruction and maintenance and non-British personnel for operations could not be accepted, as it would be unworkable in practice owing to divided responsibility. His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires was also informed that even the June proposals, if revived, would have to be subject to major conditions, (a) that the personnel should not be employed for warlike operations or against rebels, the Government of India having ievi\ed their previous objections on this point, and (b) that no foreign per sonnel should be engaged for flying the aircraft for which British personnel would be responsible. Moreover, the lack of instructional machines, the language difficulty, etc., were in any case serious obstacles to the success of the scheme; while complications over the payment and treatment of the personnel w^ould have been inevitable in view of the state of the Hejazi finances. The scheme would thus in anv case have had to be abandoned. The suggestion of an air mission had alreadv been tentatively considered; but it would not meet Ibn Sa’ud’s apparent desire to use the pilots against possible enemies or rebels, while its cost, no part of which His Maiesty’s Government could bea** in the existing crisis, would be greater than that of an unofficial personnel. i ■ * 58. The decisions regarding Ibn Sa’ud’s later proposals and the air mission suggestion were duly communicated to him through Fuad Hamza. On November 22nd the latter forwarded a message from the King regretting His Majesty’s Government’s decision, re-affirming that he did not wish to use the personnel for warlike operations against anvone but must have them under his orders whenever necessary for defence, and stating that while he ►understood His Majesty’s Government’s attitude, he was obliged to look for personnel elsewhere. This was not the first little rift in tne lute, but it oegan to aftect the tune. 59 . There the matter rested at the end of December. Nothing trans pired as to the King’s attempts to engage foreign personnel, except an unconfirmed report tnat a Polish engineer from Mecca had been sent to recruit personnel in Poland. , 60. Arabian Air Route.—His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires had on October 10th suggested to His Majesty’s Government that, if they could help Ibn Sa’ud to obtain the air personnel he required, his agreement to the facilities they sought from him in regard to landing grounds on the Hasa Coast (July-August Report, paragraph 72) might be requested as a quid fro quo. He suggested an annual rental for these grounds of £1,000 gold as the lowest which Ibn Sa’ud would be likely to consider. On November 26th the Air Ministry informed the Foreign Office, that, while it now seemed improbable that the request for facilities could be made as a quid fro quo, they would like it to be broached to Ibn Sa’ud at the first suitable oppor tunity. They considered, however, that the suggested rent was excessive, as they did not require the grounds for exclusive Royal Air Force use but only asked that they should be marked out and available for pilots flying on the Persian Gulf route to land on in case of distress; the other desiderata relating to the treatment of the crews of distressed aircraft were, they sug gested, no more than His Majesty’s Government had a right to expect on grounds of humanity and international courtesy. An annual rental of £50 for each of the three grounds would, in their opinion, be adequate to meet the cost of maintenance and renewal of the markings. His Majesty’? Charge d’Affaires was accordingly instructed on December 2nd to take up the matter with the Hejaz-Nejd Government at a suitable opportunity: one did not, however, arise before the end of the month. V.—MILITARY MATTERS, 1 ' . 61. Northern Hejaz .—During November and December the only addi tion reported to have been made to the Sa’udi forces in the northern Amirates was that of a draft of 150 men to Tabuk. The Amir of Jauf, Turki as Sudairi, moved his headquarters and wireless to Skaka, a village 22 miles North-East of Jauf, in November. In December he posted 100 camelmen and 5 cars under Ibn Hamdan forward in the Wadi Sirhan, at Isawiya. 62. Everywhere in the North the condition of the garrisons continued to deteriorate. Still no pay was issued and at Kaf and Tabuk the troops were said to be on the verge of starvation. Circumstantial reports were at the same time received from Mecca and Medina that a Nafir al ’Amm, or general call to arms for Jihad, was in progress in Nejd and the northern Hejaz. It was commonly thought that Ibn Sa’ud was on the point of risking his arm in a throw against Trans-Jordan as the only means left to him of pacifying the general discontent and offering his starving tribes the chance of helping themselves. Reflection of course suggested that Ibn Sa’ud could not be so foolish as to engage openly in an enterprise which would bring him into direct conflict with His Majesty’s Government, but the possibility could not be dismissed in the case of a man such as he, strong-willed and ambitious, who was already in hard straits and might be desperate in a few months. There was, of course, the alternative possibility of the same object being pursued less openly by the promotion of authorised raids, but no untoward development in either direction took place before the end of the year. 63. East (Nejd ).—The death of Faisal ad-Dawish in prison at Riadh (see paragraph 38) is said to have caused widespread consternation and gloom amongst the Mutair and increased bitterness against Ibn Sa’ud. ' The common belief was that he had been murdered.64. Apart from this, there were rumours of much dissatisfaction in JNejd and some specific allegations of discontent owing to oppressive taxa tion, non-payment of wages and bounties, levies in kind on merchants, attempts to impose the use of the unpopular Hejazi dollar, and the reforms instituted in the Hasa by the Mission of Muhammad at-Tawil, whose life was said to have been more than once in danger; but there was no active outbreak or military movement of note. Information was however received from Bahrain that an unusual withdrawal of horsemen from the Hasa Coast into Nejd had been noticed in November, and from Mecca to the effect that some 24,000 rifles had been collected and repaired there and sent to Riadh. The inference drawn was that, while Ibn Sa’ud was certainly consolidating his position there, it was probably more as a precautionary measure than with a view to expansion or conquest. That is as much as can be said of a situation that was unsettled and obscure. 65. South (Asir ).—Clashes were reported between Khalid bin Luwey and dissidents of the Beni Najran, who are said to have been subdued. On the whole, however, the southern frontier was quiet, thanks to the con versations reported in paragraphs 41 and 42, which resulted in the pact of Mount ’Arwa and a treaty with the Yemen. ( « VI—NAVAL MATTERS. 66 . No naval visits by British or foreign warships took place during November or December. 67. On November 5th His Majesty’s Government communicated to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires their decision regarding the advisability of the more frequent visits by His Majesty’s ships to ports in the Hejaz and Asir desired by the Admiralty (July-August Report, paragraph 78). It was decided to maintain for four months the present practice, by which His Majesty’s ships visit none of these ports except Jedda, and to review the situation at the end of this period. '! VII.—PILGRIMAGE. 68 . Forged Rnyee Notes .—More reports were received regarding the presence in ihe Hejaz of forged Indian currency notes. In one case pil grims from districts on either side of the North-West Frontier of India were said to be in posesssion of forged notes believed to have been distributed there by Soviet agents; in another, German agents were said to be distribut ing forged notes among pilgrims in the Hejaz. No confirmation of either story could be obtained, however. In December another letter was receiv ed from the alleged broker of forged notes in Syria by the member of the Legation staff who had tried to entrap him in the previous winter (January- February Report, paragraph 51). The matter was referred to His Majsty’s Consul-General at Beirut on December 27th for his views. 69. Nigerian Pilgrim Destitutes .—On November 10th the Sudan Gov ernment replied to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires’ despatch of October 6th (September-October Report, paragraph 75) regarding the 500-odd Nigerian destitutes whom the Legation was obliged to repatriate to Africa at the cost of the Nigerian Government. They pointed out that the majoritv of these destitutes had probably arrived in the Hejaz via Eritrea in sanbuqs, for had thev come via Suakin they would have had return tickets and pass ports and recent correspondence had clearly shown up the failure of the Eritrean authorities to implement the articles of the 1926 Sanitary Conven tion which bound them to prevent embarkation by Sanbuk from Massawa. In the state of unemployment existing in the Sudan and of economic depres sion reported in French West Africa, they did not feel justified in accepting the responsibility on behalf of the Government of Nigeria for the repatria tion of these destitutes, which would have the effect of encouraging pilgrims to evade quarantine measures and use the Massawa route. They suggested13 that the Eritrean authorities should be held responsible for their repatria tion A despatch from His Excellency the Governor-General, dated Novem ber 14th amplified these points but envisaged the possibility of some of the destitutes being absorbed in the Sudan labour-market in February 1932, should conditions still warrant it. 70. It was therefore arranged to examine and classify at the Legation all Nigerian destitutes then in Jedda and seeking repatriation. This examination was carried out during the 2nd week of November by the Pro- Consul, in the presence of a member of the Italian Consulate who assisted in the interrogation of the pilgrims and agreed the conclusions arrived at. It involved 5 days’ exhausting work; but the results were striking. During the month which had elapsed since the opening of the question, many more destitutes had flocked to Jedda under the stress of economic depression throughout the country, and a total of over 900 was finally examined. Some 100 had come to the Hejaz via Suakin and 800 via Massawa. Of the former, 32 held return tickets, all of which were time expired; the remain ing two-thirds had come to the Hejaz between pilgrim seasons on single tickets. 94 held pilgrim-passes or other Sudan papers; the rest had lost theirs. 71. On November 29th, 108 pilgrims who had come via Suakin were repatriated at destitute rates by Khedivial Mail steamer to Suakin, with the concurrence of the Government of Nigeria and of the Sudan Govern ment, who, while reserving their rights in the matter, undertook to waive the incoming quarantine dues. The Hejazi Government also waived out going dues. In the meantine His Majesty’s Chargd d’Affaires had approached the Italian Consul with a view to inducing the Eritrean autho rities to accept at Massawa, without payment of quarantine dues, 500 out of such destitutes as might be proved to have come to the Hejaz via Massawa, to be sent in batches of 100 by the fortnightly Italian steamer. The Consul proved helpful. He sent his interpreter,, as already stated, to be present at the interrogation of the destitutes; and on receiving the result- ing proof of the Massawa sanbuq traffic, succeeded in securing the accept ance of the proposed arrangement by the Eritrean authorities. The latter also intervened with the subventioned Italian shipping company to induce them to quote a low destitute rate. The Nigerian Government agreed to the arrangement, and on December 20th the first batch was embarked for Massawa, the Hejazi Government again waiving outgoing dues. 72. Nigermn Pilgrimage Control .—The examination of Nigerian pil grim destitutes described in paragraph 70 above incidentally showed up three undesirable aspects of the present system by which these pilgrims reach the Hejaz. The first was that far too high a proportion of these embarking at Suakin do not come during the pilgrimage season, when they are compelled to purchase return tickets, but slip over between seasons on single tickets. Another was that the 6 month period of validity of return tickets is too short to suit the leisurely habits of the African pilgrim, who on reaching the Hejaz usually works there for over a year to earn money before recrossing the Red Sea. His Majesty’s Minister, who had the previous May suggested to the Sudan Government that return tickets should be made compulsory for pilgrims all the year round and should be valid for at least a year, on December 21st again emphasized these points in a despatch to Khartoum. 73. The third and most important fact of which irresistible evidence was now afforded was the existence of a regular pilgrim traffic by sanbuq from ports on the Arabian littoral. The Foreign Office in a despatch of October 9th had forwarded corroborative evidence of this collected indepen dently by the Sudan Government and requested His Majesty’s Charge d Affaires to submit any evidence collected at Jedda which might assist His Majesty’s Government to represent the more forcibly to the Italian Government the failure of the Eritrean authorities to implement the rele vant articles of the 1926 Sanitary Convention. The information contained in paragraph 70 above was accordingly forwarded to His Majesty’s Govern ment on November 28th.u I 74. On September 10th the Nigerian Government gave their general approval to the proposals for improved control of the West African pil grimage drawn up between the Legation and the Sudan Government (March- April Report, paragraph 63). 75. 1932 Pilgrimage. —Despite active propaganda on behalf of the pilgrimage carried out in India, Malaya, and Java by the Hejaz Govern ment, including an assurance that Pilgrimage Day in 1932 would fall on a Iriday, prospects at the end of December were very poor. All the direct sailings from Singapore during November and December were cancelled for lack of bookings. Only about 2,500 Javanese arrived during these months, and the Dutch Legation thought these to be about half the eventual number, which would thus be 5,000 as against the 16,000 of 1931. The Indian pilgrimage promised slightly better; but it seemed unlikely by the end of December that the total number of overseas arrivals for 1932 would much exceed 20,000, as against the meagre 40,000 of last year. VIII.—SLAVERY. 76. Manumissions.— Nigerian male slave who took refuge in the Legation in December was manumitted and repatriated to Suakin on December 26th . -77. Intelligence Service.—As a result of a meeting of the Standing Aden Committee held in London in July, His Majesty’s Government decided not to establish a slavery intelligence service on the Arabian coast of the Red Sea. „ Abyssinian Slaves. —The successful repatriation by the Legation ot two Abyssinian slave-boys by way of Jibuti (July-August Renort, paragraph 84) led His Majesty’s Government to enquire of His Majesty’s limster at Addis Ababa whether the Ethiopian Government would be likely to consent to all Abyssinian slaves manumitted in future by the British Legation at Jedda being sent by this route at the cost of their Government as a permanent rule. Sir S. Barton in his reply of November 2nd stated that he wouid prefer to take up specific cases as they arose, rather than press tne Ethiopian Government to agree to any permanent system.

Explicit reference was made in the last case to massacre of unbelievers,, and the Legation was constrained on November 21st to ask the Hejaz Government to deport him. 81.

Ibn Sa ud.—The King left Riyadh on the 2nd January for Hufuf, the capital t)f the Hasa. * News of this visit was telegraphed by His Majesty s Min stcr to t ie Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and advantage was taken of it to arrange a meeting between Lieutenant-Colonel Biscoe and Ibn Sa ud, with resu ts which aie mentioned in paragraphs 41 to 43. Colonel Biscoe arrived at Hufuf on the 2.&gt;i&lt; January and stayed until the 28th. On the 7th February fbn Sa ud left the Hasa to return to Riyadh for the ? Id al Fitr, the breaking of the fast of Ramadhan. He remained there for the rest of February and March. 2. Accession Day. —His Majesty the King telegraphed a message of goodwishes to Ibn Sa’ud on the occasion of the anniversary of the latter’s accession day, Jan uary 8 th. 3. As a result of the opposition of the Wahhabi Llama of Nejd, reported in paragraph 21 of the Jedda report for last May—June, this year s celebration of •Accession Day was modest by comparison with that of last year. Mecca, being a religious centre under puritan protection, was entirely spared the defilement which joy occasions, but at Jedda, where morals are looser, school children sang about the streets, the Governor held a morning reception of the foreign representatives, happily not a very gay affair, and the afternoon was devoted to a tea-party at the Green Palace, which incidentally has not yet been paid for—the palace, that is , not the tea-party. This was organised by the local Celebration Committee and attended by the Viceroy, wFo came from Mecca expressly for the function. The annual celebration was thus deliberately repeated, in spite of the King s promises to his divines to be good, but there was neither review nor dinner-party nor the poetry-cum picnic-luncheon at Vadi Fatima, features which so polluted the occasion last year. 4. Ministry of Foreign Affairs. —Although His Majesty’s Minister had returned to Jedda on December 15th, no effective contact with the Hejazi Foreign Ministry otherwise than by letter or telephone was possible until the l nder-Secretary for Foreign Affairs returned from Nejd, whither he had gone on December 15th. He left Riyadh on the 2nd January, arrived at Mecca on the 5th, and came to Jedda on the 7th, followed the next day by his princeling-Minister. The latter made no attempt to live up to his title of Minister for Foreign Affairs. He was nevertheless entertained to dinner at the Legation on January 11th and seemed languidly pleased. All business was transacted with Fuad Bey Hamza, in a series Of interviews held on January 11th, 13th, 16th, 18th, 19th, 21st, and 24th. The Amir Feysal returned to Mecca on the 18th, his Under-Secretary on the 26th. 5. They returned to Jedda together on the 10th February for the signing of the Italian treaty, remained to meet the first ’Iraqi diplomatic representative on the 14th, and left again on the 17th. His Majesty’s Charge d'Affaires discussed current matters with the Under Secretary on the 11th and 16th. The next visit to Jedda was paid on March 18th, when Fuad Bey came alone to discuss pilgrimage matters with Mr. Hope Gill. He did so on the 19th and left a day or two later. He was in Jedda again during the last days of March fixing up his trip to Europe, but was not heard or seen by the Legation. Perhaps he felt that ten conversations a quarter was enough to hold with any foreign mission. Be that as it may, His Majesty’s Charg6 d’Affaires for his part was disposed to agree that one can easily have too much of a bad thing. 5-A. Constitutional Reforms. —In paragraph 3 of the last Jedda report it was remarked that Ibn Sa’ud had at length conceded the principle of a cabinet charged with joint responsibility for government and individual responsibility for depart mental affairs. On the 15th January the “ Umm-al-Qura ” published in the name God, the Merciful, the Compassionate a “ Regulation concerning the Council of Ministers ”. In form it calls for more compassion than a busy man is inclined to feel, such a rigmarole is it, such a mesh-work of cunning knots and slip-knots. In effect, however, it is just the sort of measure in which a subtle Syrain Under-Secre tary of State can entangle an autocratic Nejdi Director-General of Finance who has been keeping him and his friends short of funds. That, of course, is its raison d’ etre, to arm the intrusive Syrain clique against the possessive Nejdi gang. Fuad4 J Ta ; nza I'; 1 ' 1 . ' 0ng been f )r ? arin f? it- What is probably its most effective ar- nW,f!™ S f Ml T !f ? ay lnake en ff uir y of each other and ask for a written ex- p dilation of each other s actions. The decree’s least convincing feature is in its n.lmelvVTT ° f ? r ‘ mist , ers • . Tkere is onl y one individual Minister in the country, &lt; ely the Amir Feysal, and he is quadnform, being Viceroy and President of the ( ouncil as well as Minister for foreign Affairs and now Minister for the Interior IS' an&lt; ! Mu ^ st 7 brougl ‘t surreptitiously to birth by implication out of article 3. M misters who attend the Council are the Under-Secretary for Fo reign Affairs the Director-General of Finance, the Vice-President of the Legisla- tne Assembly, and a -Vjdi makeweight added in March, the Director of Finance i Apartments, who happens to be a brother of the Director-General. “ The Council is to meet nightly ’ says Article 12. There seems to be more of the Thousand ^ghts and a .Night in it all than of modern statecraft. The text of this important constitutional advance forms Annexure “ A ” to this report. 6. Financial -Re/bms.— Paragraphs 3 to 7 of the last Jedda report gave warning of the new budget and a copy of that instrument was annexed to the report It is now possible to show more of its inner workings. These are exposed in a tenta. five schedule drawn up by the Legation, which forms annexure “ B ” to this report items i to 5, comprising royal and military expenditure and liquidation of debt' are olhcially estimated in round-figure sums, multiples of 110. It is therefore fairly safe to assume that they are based on the official gold rate of Piastres Miri 110—£l. Thus the King is paid in gold. The 15 sub-divisions of item 6, however are estimated to the uttermost Piastre. They represent the costs of administra tion, such as salaries, wages, etc., and in view of the Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs’ admission of January 19 to His Majesty’s Minister, that much of the ex penditure lumped together in the “ Budget ” as Piastres Miri would in fact be in curred in silver, it is also fairly safe to assume that all payments under item 6 are calculated to be made in silver Piastres. 7. I his curiously mixed statement of estimated expenditure, called “the budget , seems to bear no relation at all to the percentage allotments confidentially stated last year to form the basis of the budgetary reform (November-December report, paragraph 4). This basis seems to have gone by the board already. It was indeed not clear how the King could live on it, since it left him entirely out of ac count. It is now clear however that he or his Comptroller, Sheykh ’Abdullah ►Suleyman, will receive about half the total Hejazi revenue, namely items 1 to 3, or £410,000 to be devoted to royal and military needs, The Hejaz-Nejd memoran dum circulated at the Disarmament Conference at Geneva leads one to suppose that he will also take care of item 4, £100,000 for Communications and Trans port, and thereby haye the spending of half a million pounds. 8. If revenue does not come up to expectations—and these have been left conveniently vague—item 5, liquidation of Government indebtedness will undoubt edly be the first to suffer the pinch, followed by item 6, the salaries and wages of Government servants. The first 4 months of the Hejazi financial year have now passed but only 3 months’ salaries and wages haive been paid ; this failure is addition al to the 4 to 8 months' previous arrears of pay which have been consolidated for eventual liquidation under item 5. 9. The Hejaz of Ibn Sa ud, in fact, is not unlike the England of King Charles II, with the pleasing difference that the King does not have to ask parliament for money. His Nejdis control revenue at the source and send most of it in specie to His Majesty. At the end of Bamadhan, for instance, no salaries were paid but £12,000 in sovereigns and 100,000 silver riyals (nominally £10,000) were reported to have been sent from Mecca to the King at Riyadh. Nevertheless Ibn Sa’ud has been recently heard to say that he literally hardly knows how to support him self and his family and that one quarter of the revenues of Hasa had to be remitted to Mecca to help finance the Hejaz. Such is truth to a Semite. 10. To sum up the financial reform in the dictum of an ex-Mayor of Jedda, “ the whole budget is so much eye-wash 11 . News of the engagement of a Dutch financial adviser, M. van Leeuwen, was published in March. He is expected to complete his labour in a year. The “ Umm- al-Qura ” of the 1st April published a vigorous denial of the rumoured loan of ft *i 5 £500,000 by His Majesty’s Government to Ibn Sa'ud, “ in return for his renuncia tion of certain matters which affect his independence, such as the appointment of an English adviser to supervise the organisation of his finances ” Forgetting the hints and requests and negotiations of last year for financial aid from London and Amsteidam, the editor concluded : “ The Government of His Majesty have not contracted a loan with anybody, thank God, and they cannot tolerate interference in any matter which concerns their complete and full inde pendence.” M. van Leeuwen is due to arrive in April. 12 . The market value of the Sa’udi riyal fluctuated during the quarter between 17 and 15 to the gold sovereign and 13 and 11J to the £ sterling, with a strengthening tendency due to the approaching pilgrimage. 13. Economic Situation. —Eamadhan is normally an expensive and busy month, when the merchants and shop-keepers expect to do well. This year there was absolute stagnation in Mecca and conditions were little better in Jedda. The populations of the towns were too crippled with debt to move. Such information as was received about the tribes indicated that their condition was still no better than that of utmost misery described in paragraph 17 of the November-December report. 14. Economic Devebpment. —Mr. Twitched returned to the Hejaz on January 18th from his prospecting tour in Nejd and the Hasa, the main results of which are still hidden. It is known, however, that he advocates the sinking of wells along the Jedda-Itiyadh-Hufuf road and the construction of a harbour at Ras Tanura on the Hasa coast. In the latter half of February he examined some ancient workings near Medina called “ Mahd Dhahab ” or “ Got of Gold ”, which are supposed to date from Harun-ar-Rashid’s days. He considers it worth while to employ up to 100 men in sampling the site. His confederate, Mr. Moseley, working alone on quartzes near Taif, does not seem to have found anything worth report ing. He left early in March for the United States of America and Mr. and Mrs. Twitched sailed for the Yemen on March 7th, leaving voluminous reports and recommendations in the hands of Ibn Sa’ud and his Council. The former apparently resented being given advice for which he had not asked. The latter passed the reports round amongst their more commercially-connected friends, no doubt with suitable safeguards against the time when concessions should be granted and the work of development began. If mere cupidity were enough, this would be the wealthiest country in the world. But wdiere energy and ability is needed, there is no power and no might save in God alone. 15. Customs. —The Jedda customs receipts for the first three Moslem months of the financial year which began on December 11th last were, according to un official information supplied to the Legation, Piastres Miri 4,925,558-30, equiva lent at the rate of exchange then ruling to £27,400 gold. Other Red Sea ports of the kingdom, e.g., Yanbu, took perhaps half as much again, which would bring the total to about £40,000 gold. The Persian Gulf Customs were framed out in January last for 11 lakhs of rupees to Muhammad-at-Tawil, once Prime Minister of the Hejaz, during the reign of King ’Ali. He was sent to the Hasa by Ibn Sa’ud in the autumn of 1930 to reform the customs administration (Jedda report for September to November 1930, paragraph 4). In February, however, Muhammad- at-Tawil apparently had to ask that the figure of 11 lakhs should be reduced, as he was unable to raise the amount. He visited Jedda in March after a year and a half’s absence in Nejd, wither he has now returned unwillingly at the King’s orders. In his present frame of mind it is quite possible that he may try to escape the coun try, once back on the Persian Gulf coast, and seek freedom by way of Bahrain. 16. Wireless System. —None of the monthly instalments of £l,000 have been paid to the Marconi Company since last August. It is understood that they have now been relegated to item 5 of the “ budget ”, entitled indebtedness, payable if and when funds admit. Meanwhile the work of installation proceeded slowly. Mr. Boucicault is believed to have completed the J-kilowatt station at Qaf o: Qaryat al Milh, the ‘‘ Salt-villages ” in the Wadi Sirhan. Kurdy Bey has started work on the main 6-kilowatt station at Mecca. MC144FD6 17. Communications. —The projected motor-route to connect Medina with ’Iraq has made no material progress. It is still in the stage of a preliminary ex change of views as to terms, dues payable, passport and quarantine controls, etc., etc., between the Hejzi and ’Iraqi Governments. The former’s proposals are greedy and not very practical and have not been well received. 18. Legislation. —A voluminous commercial code at length completed piece meal publication in the “ Umm-al-Qura ” in February. All that is now lacking in this respect is a competent court and bar ; the existing Majlis at-Tujjar or Tri bunal of Merchants is most incompetent. 19. Instructions governing the boarding of ships lying in Jedda harbour were issued in January. They were brought officially to the notice of the foreign mis sions in February. These were asked to supply lists of the names of their staffs, so that embarkation permits might be issued to them. This appeared to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires to infringe diplomatic immunity and therefore meet to be resisted, in that momentary forgetfulness to carry the permit might seriously interfere with the performance of a duty to visit an incoming or departing vessel. He therefore expressed regret to the Hejazi Government that he could not instruct the Legation staff to carry this type or permit, but he communicated the required lists, containing 33 names, and asked that they might be made known to the control officials posted on the quay. There the matter has been allowed to rest and no cases of interference have been experienced since a few unsuccessful attempts were made in January to hold up the Indian Vice-Consul when visiting prilgrim ships. 20 . No other legislation of importance was enacted during the period under review. 21. Waqfs. —At the beginning of the year a zealous body was formed in Mecca which called itself the “ Awqaf-al-Harameyn Claims Association ”, having the object of “ claiming through legitimate channels that which is due to the people of the two Holy Sanctuaries, Mecca and Medina, in the way of donations and Awqaf in various countries ”. A Committee of 10 has been formed under the presidency of Sheykh ’Abdullah-ash-Sheybi, son of Sheykh ’Abdul Qadir-ash-Sheybi, heredi tary Keeper of the Keys of the Ka’ba, whose family has battened more fatly on the faithful than have most Meccawis and is now peerless. 22. The Rub’-al-Khali.— The Empty Quarter has again been crossed by an Englishman, this time under the auspices of Ibn Sa’ud who, according to the “ Umm-al-Qura ”, appears to regard that desert also as a part of his dominions. Mr. Philby set out from Hufuf on January 6th and reached Mecca on April 51 h. Ibn Sa’ud’s Amir of Hasa provided him with 32 of the best ’Omania camels and 18 Beduin, sectional Sheykhs of the ’A] man and Murra tribes, as companions and guides. Their route was as follows :—Hu uf, Salwa on the coast between Qatar and Hasa, the Jabrin oasis, Maqainama Well (22 lO'N. 49 KVE.), Bir Fadhil (22 15' N. 50 20'E.), Farajja (21 35' N. 50 45'E.) ten miles to the West of which Mr. Philby thinks he found the Beduin traditional site of the ancient city of Ubar (w r hich really was in the Yemeni highlands), Naifa (19 50' N. 51 E.), and Shanna (19 N. 51 05'E.). 23. From Shanna they made an attempt to cross the Emptiest Eighth, the 350-mile wide completely waterless tract between Shanna and Sulaiyil (20 25' N. 45 30' E.). On the fifth day out however and about a third of the way across the camels failed and they had to make back to the nearest water, Naifa, which they reached in another 5 days on March 1st, their water giving out 12 hours before they came to the well. 24. At Naifa they rested and re-formed. Mr. Philby sent back to Biyadh the 14 weakest camels, 3 having died, with 8 men and all tents and other baggage. He made the second attempt westward light, with 15 camels and 10 men. On the 10th day, after 111 hours marching across completely waterless sand and gravel, during v/hich the camels received no water and picked up practically no vegetation, the party reached Sulaiyil with 2 petrol-tins of water in reserve. Thence they made their way leisurely by Bisha, Turaba, and Taif to Mecca. Mr. Philby visited Jedda on April 6th. He must have covered some 1,500 miles in the 90 days outing, but showed remarkably little sign of the strain. He has enough specimens and material to work on for a year, but has first to answer the shower of well-deserved congratulatory telegrams and offers which has met him in Jedda from all parts of the world, including one from Mr. Bertram Thomas.7 CHAPTER II. —Frontier Questions. Trans-Jordan. 25. Raiding .—No raids were reported to have been made during the quarter from either side of the frontier, yet ail was not quiet on the northern front. 26. Frontier Meetings. —It will be recalled that, after much diplomatic pre paration in Jedda, a series of meetings between the frontier representatives for the liquidation of past raids and the settlements of future differences was arranged last April. The preliminary meeting took place on the 3rd June 1931, when contact was established between Captain Glubb and Sheykh ’Abdul ’Aziz-ibn-Zeyd. The first phase of the main meeting was not held until August 15th ; the Nejdi was then quite unprepared, but agreed to return a little loot, while Captain Glubb feared open rupture if they were to meet again and went on leave. At the end of October however he invited the Sheykh to meet him again for the second phase. He received a reply 2 months later and they met near Haditha on the 7th January. This meeting proved fruitless. The atmosphere was very friendly and the two representatives quite old friends, but the Nejdi had no authority to negotiate or compromise. Captain Glubb on his part declined to discuss the 1930-31 claims until the raid of the 28th September last was disposed of. They failed to agree on this or any matter, except provisionally to meet again after Ramadhan, mid- February. The Legation is unaware that this or any other meeting has been held. 27. His Majesty's Minister s visit to Jerusalem. —In pursuance of a plan pro visionally made in Lond( n while on leave last autumn but advanced somewhat certain circumstances in Trans-Jordan, His Majesty’s Minister left Jedda on the 2 nd of February to visit His Majesty’s High Commissioner for Trans-Jordan. He spent the 12th and 13th at ’Amman, where the following matters were discussed with the British Resident, who was assisted by Mr. Kirkbride, Peake Pasha, and Captain Glubb :— (1) The ’Atun section of the Huweytat, with special reference to— (a) Their national status, (5) ‘Araif camels, (c) The effects of the raid of September 28th, 1931, (d) Hejazi handling of the loot taken. (2) The Beni ’Atiya— (a) Their natic nal status, (6) The proposed refusal to them of access to Trans-Jordan. (3) (a) General question of determination of tribal nationality, (b) Possibility of agreement with Hejaz-Nejd as-to allocation of tribes. (4) The military and quasi-military situation on the frontier, with special reference to— (а) Competitive establishment of posts, (б) Ibn Sa’ud’s alleged military preparations. (5) The general situation on the frontier, with special reference to— (a) Actual or possible recrudescence of raiding, (5) Glubb-Ibn Zeyd position and future co-operation, (c) Complaints against Captain Glubb, retaliatory confiscation, wihhold- ing returnable loot, (d) Handing over of “ raiding criminals (6) (a) Diplomatic discussion at Jedda of Fuad Bey Hamza’s “ principles ”, (b) Establishment of direct and normal Trans-Jordan relations with Hejaz- Nejd.tm 8 (7) Minor points outstandirg at the end of 1931— (а) Commission on loot, (б) Allegation of asylum given to criminals, (c) Allegations of enticement, (d) Taxation of sojourners, (e) Press attacks. (8) Closer and more direct collaboration between Jerusalem and Jedda— (a) Greater conciseness in Trans-Jordan reports and greater expedition in forwarding, (b) Sifting of Trans-Jordan reports by Jerusalem in the light of major policy, (c) Importance of recording all raids, ard as soon as possible, (d) Clear indication as to distribution of copies of despatches and reports^ (e) Cedes, (/) Excharge of intelligence. (9) Miscellaneous— (а) Nature of Trans-Jordan forces, (б) Beduin Control Board and the Amir Shakir, {c) Druze refugees in Nejd, (d) Frontier at Jebel Tubaik, (e) Commercial relations with Hejaz-Nejd, (/) Wireless communications. 28. These discussions at ‘Amman, though not conclusive cn various questions were most useful and enabled His Majesty's Minister to clear up many points in a frank and friendly manner. Sir A. Ryan has recorded his appreciation of the courtesy shown him by Colonel Ccx and his colleagues and their readiness to recognise that such divergencies of view as arise from lime to time are not due to unwillingness on the part of the Legation at Jedda to support Trars-Jordan in dealing with a most trcublescme situation, but to the frequent difficulty of accomo dating action as regards Trans-Jordan questions with the broad policy of keeping Ibn Sa’ud sweet and giving him moral support for reasons of imperial interest. 29. On the 13th February His Majesty’s Minister was received by the Amir Abdullah, who was most affaVe. He spoke temperately throughout of the “ King of Nejd While not excluding the possibility of full recognition of Ibn Sa’ud, if His Majesty's Government considered tl at the right course, he put his finger unerringly on the weak spot, from his point of view, in any argument in favour of his adopting it just now. As the most likely aspirant, perhaps, to the reversion of the Hejazi throne, should the Sa'udian regime collapse, he is doubtless very unwilling to compromise his hopes by recognising the kingship of Ibn Sa'ud at a time when the latter’s position is menaced by so many difficulties. 30. On the 15th February His Majesty’s Minister reviewed with His Majesty’s High Commissioner for Trans-Jordan the most important, from a Jerusalem point of view, of the matters discussed on the previous days at ’Amman. Sir A. Ryan left Jerusalem on the 16th for London, whither he had been unexpectedly sum moned for consultation by His Majesty’s Government. 31. Export of Cereals. —The Hejaz-Nejd Government drew the Legation’s attention in January to reports they had received of some sort of an embargo on trade from Trans-Jordan into Nejd. After enquiry had been made of Jerusalem, they were informed that an embargo had been placed on the export from Trans- Jordan of cereals, irrespective of their destination, and that the order had been necessitated by internal prices in Trans-Jordan but might be removed in the future. The Hejazi Government replied in March that they appreciated these motives but hoped that it might now be possible to remove the prohibition n gainst their own subjects.9 32. Ihn Hamclan. —At the instance of the High Commissioner for Trans- Jordan the Hejaz-Nejd (government’s serious attention was drawn in February to an unfriendly incident of December 28th, staged on the frontier by Nejdi troops under the command of one Ibn Hamdan. They had apparently approached 4 Trans-Jordan Arab Legionaries who were encamped in Trans-Jordan territory, executed a war dance before them, and fired at an improvised target; they had then drawn closer and scrutinised the Legion camp through tiled-glasses. His Majesty's Charge d Affaires protested against this unwarranted and unfriendly action on the part of armed forces under the control of the Hejaz-Nejd Government, asked for a full enquiry, and suggested that in the interests of friendly relations they should inform him of the action taken to punish those responsible. 33. In conversation with His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires in March the Under secretary for Foreign Affairs seemed disposed to argue that the Trans-Jordan Legionaries had been camped in Nejd territory, but he promised a full investigation and an early reply. No reply has yet been received. 34. MacDonnell Investigation.—His Majesty’s Minister followed up the earlier representations recorded in paragraph 35 of the last Jedda report by speaking emphatically to the Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs on the 11th January about the refusal of the Hejaz-Nejd Government to bear their share or the costs of the MacDonnell Investigation. He strongly advised them to reconsider their atti tude without awaiting the reaction of His Majesty’s Government to their note of November 28th hinting that otherwise the reaction might be very disagreeable. On the 17th January Fuad Hamza wrote semi-officially to say that His Majesty the King had given his gracious command to the effect that no objection should be raised to the payment of the sum and that he sanctioned its payment to the British Government, with thanks. The sum has not of course been paid and is unlikely to be paid until item 5 of the ' budget is financed (see paragraph 8 above). The sum in question is £1,726-7-8. 35. The Beni 'Aliya. —The movement of Beni ’Atiya into Trans-Jordan fore seen by Captain Glubb last summer (see paragraph 37 of the Jedda report for Sep- tember-October), actually took place in February, when some 250 tents moved northward over the frontier. Their motive, however,was apparently rather to find grazing then to escape punishment, although they seem to have deserved it—unless indeed it be true, as suggested by Captain Glubb last year, that they had received carte blanche from Ibn Sa’ud to raid, in order to dissuade disaffected Hejazi tribes further south from making northward for Trans-Jordan through the Beni ’Atiya dira. No rain at all is said to have fallen this year in the northern Hejaz between its northern frontier and a point some 50 miles South of Taima, so the Beni ’Atiya together with the Huweytat at-Tihama and the Billi, moved both Norty and South ^ from their normal diras in search of grazing. 36. While some were moving northward, the Amir of the district sallied forth from Tabuk with 130 camel-men and a machine-gun. He set out immediately after the fast of Ramadhan and held to the eastward of the Beni ’Atiya tents, marching quickly up the Hejaz railway until near the Trans-Jordan frontier. A little short of Hajj he turned westward, thus interposing his force between the moving tribe and Trans-Jordan. On the 14th and 15th February he fell upon the nearest tents and progressed steadily southward through the re.-t of them back to Tabuk, which he reached on the 20th after mopping up everything in his way and driving off 350 camels, the Arabs say, beside many more sheep. On the same day the leading tents of the Beni ’Atiya began to cross info Trans-Jordan. The south ward-bound portion of the tribe had meanwhile passed to the south of Taima. ^ 37. Infir math n available to the Royal Air Force in Trans-Jordan indicates that the Beni ’Atiya who entered Trans-Jordan were refugees from justice, but Captain Glubb, who w^as in close touch with them, was convinced that their migra tion was of a routine nature, but began before the normal time because of the lack of rain further South. By the middle of March, according to Royal Air Force reports, 300 tents had crossed the frontier with 2,000 camels. They were collected well away fx^m the frontier and sent North of Ma’an under police supervision. 38. On the 29th February the Hejaz-Nejd Minister in London requested that these tribesmen should be returned by the Trans-Jordan authorities to the Hejaz. MC144FD10 It was suggested to him at the Foreign Office that such frontier questions could test be raised through the frontier authorities, or if that was impracticable, through the Legation at Jedda. He promised to suggest the former channel to his Government, but the latter on the 9th March addressed themselves to His Majesty's Charge d J Affaires, invoking the inconclusive correspondence of 1930-31 about denial of refuge in Trans-Jordan to certain Beni ’Atiya groups-(see 1931, January-February report, paragraph 11), and expressing the hope that the British Government would agree to refusing present refuge to the Beni Atiya in Trans-Jordan. An exchange of views and reports on the facts of the matter proceeded between London and Jerusalem, but no decision as to a reply had been reached by the end of the month. ’Iraq. 39 . Material for reply to Fuad Bey Hamza’s demarche of last September (September-October report, paragraph 39), regarding certain remnant chiefs in ’Iraq of the 1929 Nejdi rebellion, was received in January, but v T as not used, as Fuad Bey had not again mentioned the matter and the ’Iraqi representative was expected shortly to arrive. The gist of the reply, if made, would have been that these chiefs w r ere not near the frontier and that so far as w~as known they were keeping quiet and had received no special favours. * 40. The ’Iraqi representative’s arrival is reported in paragraph 67. It is to be hoped that he w r ill shortly be in a position to relieve the Legation completely of questions concerning Iraq. Kuwait and Bahrain. 41. Bucoe-Ihn Saud Meeting. —As soon as it w T as known definitely in Jedda that Ibn Sa’ud had left .Riyadh on January 2nd for the Hasa, steps were taken to bring about the courtesy visit to him of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, which had been spoken of at His Majesty’s Minister’s audience of the King cn the 2nd March 1931 (March-April report, paragraph 29) and recorded at the inter-departmental conference held at the Foreign Office on the 12th August (September-October report, paragraph 42), as a necessary preliminary to the nego tiation of the Persian Gulf questions. The Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs having arrived at Jedda and His Majesty at Hufu, Sir A. Ryan was able to com municate through the former by wireless with the latter and prepare him for the visit. On January 17th Lieutenant-Colonel Biscoe telegraphed a personal message from Bushire via Bahrain to Ibn Sa'ud and received a reply asking him to come as soon as possible. Accompanied by the Political Agents at Kuwait and Bahrain,. he reached Hsa via ’ Uqair on January 23rd, stayed 4 days in Hufuf with the King,, /-&gt; and left for Bahrain on the 28th. 42. The following matters w T ere discussed with Ibn Sau’d personally or wdtli his chief political adviser, Sheykh Yusuf Yasin : (i) The Kuwait blockade ^ {ii) Emergency landing-grounds on the Hasa coast' (m) Telegraphic and postal communication between Hasa and the outer w^orld via Bahrain ; (iv) Passport facilities for Nejdi subjects proceeding to India or Iraq; (v) Possible consular status, of Nejdi representatives in Bahrain and Kuwait; (vi) Incursions by Nejdi officials and troops into Kuwait territory ; (vii) Possible simple extradition treaty between Bahrain and Nejd. 43. Ibn Sa’ud’a attitude throughout was one of extreme cordiality. The visit was successful chiefly owing to the fact tht it was informed and that Colonel Biscoe went with no instructions from His Majesty’s Government but merely‘to establish friendly relations and talk over questions of mutual interest. Results will be recorded as they occur..11 4. f)n Janaury 28th Ibn Sa’ud gave Colonel Biscoe the following message for His Majesty’s Government:— “ I wish you to give my greetings to the British Government, and to tell them that I speak to them with the word of a Moslem Arab. First, I neither desire nor seek greater friendship from anyone else in the whole world, whether European or Moslem Government, than the friendship of the British Government and it is impossible that I should seek to differ from them in any matter. Secondly, I de ire p6ace and friendship with the whole world, especially with those of my neighbours and others who are in relations with the British Government. Who speaks to the contrary about me is Wrong or a liar and has not understood. If such a thing is said of me, I ask the British Government to refer the matter to me and explain to me the exact mistake attributed to me, but oh condition that the request be made through the agency of an intelligent man who will understand frchi me the truth and will not misunderstand.” This message shcull be read however in conjunction with the slavery chapter of this report. 45. Kuwait .—On this return to Kuwait Lieutenant-Colonel Dickson discussed with the Ruler Ibn ^a’ud’s rproposals regarding the raising of the commercial blockade or Kuwait. His Excellency was very sceptical of any useful result accruing from the suggested appointment of arbitrators to meet and work out a Compromise agreeable to both parties. He finally agreed to it however, subject to certain conditions, and Colonel Dickson was instructed in March to obtain his con sent in writings The Ruler visited Ibn Saud at Riyadh from March 16th to SlsR travelling both Ways by car* 46* An unhappy band of pilgrims left Kuwait on the 19th February overland for Mecca under the leadership of the Ruler’s cousin, Sheykh Subah an-Nasir A1 Subah. Ibn Sa’ud suspected them of wishing to smuggle contraband into Nejd. “ May God save you ”, he wrote to the Rulerj “ but We have come to know that wuth the pilgrims are people of Nejd and others who are carrying much merchan dise, costly goods, which constitute the principal source of Our income* That We should inspect the pilgrims and search them to the bottom, especially as there are females amongh them, is neither appropriate nor in keeping with the dignity of Us two ”* He asked therefore that the leader of the bend should carry with him and produce ah Inventory of all dutiable goods. The_ pilgrims had already left however before the letter arrived. The Ruler in reply said that he could do nothing “ their question now concerns God and Your Majesty ’. The outcome is not yet known. 47, On the llth January} having at length received full particulars from Kuwait, His Majesty’s Minister addressed the Hejaz-Nejd Government on the subject of a series of armed incursions made into Kuwait territory in August and October 1931 by officials of Ibn Sa’ud.- He stated that these intrusions were of the most serious concern to His Majesty’s Government, in view of their special position m regard to Kuwait* In protesting against them, he requested that the guilty parties be punished and that instructions be given to all frontier officers that neither they nor their men should enter Kuwait territory without proper sanction. The Hejazi Government replied on January 23rd that the truth of the allegation was being investigated and that the frontier Amirs had been ordered to see that no one entered Kuwait without a permit. On the 29th January a telegram was re ceived from Colonel Biscoe to the effect that the King had shown him at Hufuf a telegram from the Foreign Ministry at Mecca purporting to give the substance of Sir A. Ryan’s note of January llth and the Ministry’s reply. The note, as reported to the King, demanded that no Nejdis should in future enter Kuwait ; ihe King had therefore replied that no Kuw'aitis should in future enter Nejd12 48. Fortunately for good relations, Colonel Biscoe was able to convince Ibn 8a’ud on the spot that there must have been a mistake, since only the incursion of armed forces had been objected to ; the latter at once cancelled his former instruc tions. Sir A. Ryan also rubbed into Faud Bey Hamza, who w r as no doubt res ponsible for misrepresenting to the King the contents of his note, the exact mean ing of the clear language he had used. That phrase of Ibn Sau'd's recurs to the mind ; “ on condition that the request be made through the agency of an intel ligent man Faud Bey is more subtle than intelligent. Bahrain. 49. In 1920, at Ibn Sahd’s personal request, the 5 per cent, ad valorem dues levied cn all goods passing in transit through Bahrain to the mainland w'as reduced to 2 per cent., and a further concession was made in respect of gocds transhipped from steamers direct into lighters bound for the mainland, on which no duty was to be charged. This concession was always unpopular in Bahrain and in 1931 the second part of it was prejudiced by an agreement made between the Bahrain State and the British India shipping company, to the effect that the company w ould refuse to accept any cargo for overside delivery in Bahrain harbour, in con sideration for an extension of free demurrage from the ruling 3 days to 10 days on all cargo landed at Bahrain from their ships. Ibn Sahid has not yet protested, but in ^ew of the probability that he will, and also on grounds of principle, the question was receiving consideration in March from the Government of India. Asir and the Yemen. 50. On the 13th March the Hejaz-Nejd Government communicated to the foreign representatives a copy of the treaty of December 15th signed writh the Yemen. The text had previously been published in the “ Umm al Qura ” of Feb ruary 26th, copies of which were seen in San’a. It has been noticeable however to regular Hejazi readers of the Yemeni Imam’s newspaper, “ Iman,” that it has completely ignored the treaty. Moreover, when the Dutch Charge d'Affaires at Jedda, in the course of a visit to San'a from which he has recently returred congratulated the Imam on being now r linked in friendship with Ibn Sa’ud, the Imam laughed heartily at the idea of his having signed any treaty with Ibn Sa’ud and said that the only instrument negotiated had been a working agreement be tween the Amir’s of lizan and Medi by which a modus vivendi had been established on the frontier. 51. The situation in Asir and on the Yemeni frontier has been obscure. It is believed that some Asiri tribes revolted in the beginning of February against the Nejdi occupation but that the revolt was crushed by Ibn Sa’ud's Amir Khalid bin Luwey, after more tribal fighting in the Najran district. The beduin Nejdi troops how'ever were said to have but little stomach left for meeting the Asiri highlanders. Looting had become too dangerous. CHAPTER III.— Foreign Relations. British Empire. 52. Complaint against his Majesty's Minister. —In immediate reaction to the manumission by the Legation of a slave claimed by Ibn Sa’ud (see Chapter VIII), the Hejaz-Nejd Government on February 8th complained of Sir A. Ryan’s beha viour and stated, in effect, that his retention in the post of His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda w r as not conducive to good relations. Sir A. Ryan had left Jedda on February 2nd on a visit to Jerusalem (see paragraph 27) ; on the conclusion of the visit he proceeded to London. His Majesty’s Government answered the Hejazi complaint in full on March 21st and stated that, if it were not w ithdrawn, neilher would Sir A. Ryan resume his duties as His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda, nor would any other Minister of His Majesty 's Service replace him. The Hejazi Government climbed dowm on April 5th. His Majesty’s Minister remained in London to meet the Hejazi mission, with the intention of returning to Jedda by the end of May. 53. Hejaz-Nejd Mission to London. —Ibn Sa’ud chose this moment to announce a mission to the capitals of friendly countries, wdiieh may already have been in contemplation but had been kept remarkably dark. His Majesty’s Government were asked on March 24th by the Hejaz-Nejd Minister in London whether they would receive the Amir Feysal, accompanied by Faud Bey Hamza, in May. TheyV 13 replied that \heir answer must depend on the Hejazi Government’s action regard ing their note of complaint against Sir A. Ryan. On April 8th they were informed that His Majesty’s Government would be glad to receive their mission. It sailed &lt;rom Jedda on the 12th April to visit Rome, Geneva, Paris, London, The Hague, Berlin, Warsaw, Moscow, Angora, Tehran and Baghdad. Before they left, Faud Bey Hamza showed Mr. Hope Gill their programme of dates. They were due in Paris on April 31st. On being told that might not be a good day, Faud Bey changed it to May 1st, but when he heard of May Day and communists and unemployed and what-all, not to mention the French elections, he recoiled into April. Faud is 33, Feysal 27. These neophytes are escorted by a half-witted A.-D.-C. done up in a uniform to taste, and a negro attendant who looks like a slave. It is understood that they have enough money with them. 54. Other Matters. —Relations during the last 5 months were overshadowed in January by the slave incident and clouded for the remainder by the demand for Sir A. Ryan’s recall. They were enlivened somewhat locally in March by pil grimage difficulties which are recounted in Chapter \TI. In his series of interviews held in January with the Hejazi Lender Secretary, His Majesty’s Minister covered a good deal of other ground, notably in connection with debts, the coming pilgrimage, Trans-Jordan, Persian Gulf questions and Colonel Biscoe s visit, and emergency landing-grounds on the Hasa Coast. None of the debts owing to His Majesty’s Government, the Government of India and other British creditors were of course paid. Trans-Jordan affairs have been dealt with in paragraphs 25-38, Persian Gulf questions in paragraphs 41-49, and the landing grounds in Chapter L\. International. 55 . Internatimal Sanitary System. —After mature consideration of the advice given them last July (July-August report, paragraph 50), the Hejazi Government acceded in March to the Rome Convention of 1907. 56. Paris Pact. —They also adhered, in February, to the Kellogg Pact, notify ing the American Government through the United States Ambassador in London. 57. Disarmament Conference. —The Hejaz-Nejd Minister in London was dele gated in January to represent his Government at Geneva. A lengthy memoran dum giving information on the armaments of the Hejaz, Nejd and Dependencies was circulated to the Conference on February 8th, followed on the 24th by a memo randum by the Hejazi Delegation notifying his views as to the need and manner of disarming the world. 58. Congresses. —His Majesty’s Government’s invitation to attend the Fifth International Congress of Local Authorities (July-August report, paragraph 54) was accepted by the Hejaz-Nejd Government in January, their Minister in London being deputed to represent them. An invitation to attend the London International Congress on Commercial Education was apologetically declined. Italy. 59. A treaty of frierdship with Italy ard a commercial agreement were at length signed on February 10th, after rcgotiat ons lasting two years. The Italian draft anti-slave trade clause has ban dropped (e/. Novembcr-December report, paragraph 47). Germany. 60. M. de Haas re-assumed charge of his Consulate on the 23rd March. The Netherlands. 61. M. Adr aanse left Jedda cn the 7th March on a brief visit to the Yemen to present Queen Wilhelmina’s reply to a letter of greeting sent to her last year by the Imam Yahya on the occasion of M. van der Meulen's visit to Sana (May- June report, paiagraph 46). No other political significance attached to this visit. 62. A. M. van Leeuwen, erstwhile of the Netherlands Trading Society, was engaged in March by the Hejaz-Nejd Government as financial adviser for a year at £2,000 (see paragraph 11 above). MC144FDSoviet Russia, 63. The Soviet Charge d’Affaires has presented the Amir Feysal with 5 rifles of a pattern known as “ Turki ” and apparently much prized by Beduin. He was also discovered recently holding a small arms exhibition in his Legation, No arms are known to have been ordered. 64. The last consignment of Soviet benzine, 30,000 cases, was landed at Jedda in February in completion of the contract of last summer (July-August report, paragraph 63). Payment is understood to have been relegated to item 5 of the “ budget Turkey, 65. On January 28th the Turkish Ambassador called on His Majesty’s Prin cipal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to tell him that the Turkish Government had been asked by the Hejazi Government to lend pilots and mechanics for the development of their air service and to send a military mission to give similar help to the Hejazi army, Ferit Bey said that, before replying to this request, the Turkish Government, having regard to their very friendly relations with His Majesty's Government, desired to inform them of the request and to consult them about it, He was thanked for his communication and subsequently told that His Majesty’s Government saw no reason why the Turkish Government should not accede to the Hejazi Government’s request. This request follows upon Ibn Sa’ud’s failure to obtain British personnel (see November-December report, paragraph 59). There is no sign as yet of the arrival of any Turkish personnel or mission, Egypt. 66. At the end of 1931 the Egyptian Prime Minister informed His Majesty’s Representative at Cairo that Egypt now had a Consular representative of some ability at Jedda and that according to this official’s reports the difficulties which stood in the way of establishing friendly and regular lelaticns were not insoluble, Sidky Pasha added that he was occupying himself with the matter, with the pur pose and in the hope of solving the difficulties, which were of a religious as well as of a political order. Hafiz Amer Bey, however, who went on leave of absence last September, has not yet returned to Jedda and nothing is known lo ally either of any progress in Egypto-Hejazj relations or of the Egyptian Consul's movements, 'Iraq, 67. Dr. Naji al Asil, King Faisal's first diplomatic representative at the cour; of King Ibn Sa’ud, arrived in Jedc'a on the 14th February with a wife (not visible and family and a secretary and clerk. He wes greeted as ‘Iraqi Charge d’Affaires and Consul General by the Viceroy but his letters of credence were not accepted ; they named him specifically lo Mecca instead of to Jedda, His luggage and Ids note-paper bore the same address (see paragraph 40 of the report for September- October). There has apparently been either a misunderstanding on the part of Nuri Pasha, who stems (onvinced that Ibn Sa’ud agreed with him last Much that Mecca should be the seat of the new Legation, for reasons of special considera tion for his brother Faisal; or else Ibn Sa’ud did indeed agree to the proposal, but his Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs, who was ill and absent at the time, must have managed on his return to make him go back on his decision and omitted to mention it to the ’Iraqis. Whatever the cause, the effect was distinctly disagrt^ able to Dr. Naji, who has taken h's anomalous position very philosophically, how ever, has failed as yet to secure an honourable compromise, and has settled down in Jedda to await results. He learned at the end of March that King Faisal would send a personal message by special courier to Ibn Sa'ud, appealing to him to honour his bond. The incident is an ill omen for independent Traqo-Nejdi rela tions. Dr. Naji has shown himself very friendly disposed to the Legation, which he often visits for advice and to exchange information, A[fghanistan. 68. Ahmad Shah Khan, Minister of Court and cousin of King Nadir Shah, arrived on pilgrimage on March 17th and with the further objects of negotiating a treaty with Ibn Sa’ud and of building an Afghan pilgrim hostel at Mecca which should redound to the credit of the Afghan king. Having brought very little money, he is having difficulty with this objective. Nothing definite is yet known of the course of the negotiations, but there are indications of a deplorable atmos phere of suspicion.United States of A mer ica. fif). Mr. Crane's American engineer left for the Yemen on March 7th after making an extensive prospecting tour in the Hejaz and Nejd and detailed recommendations to Ibn Sa*ud for the development of his wealth by the perchase of American machinery and the engagement of American mining experts (see para graph 14 above). He may return shortly to press his suit, which is not thought to please the King, however, Poland. 70. In February a Polish Professor of Chinese culture, who claimed to speak 40 languages and to live in Cairo with a tubercular wife, visited Jeddafrom. Egypt. From the languages which he held on various occasions it was understood that his object was primarily to obtain payment from the Hejazi Government of something over two million zloty in respect of the Polish arms delivered in 1930 (August 1930 report, paragraph 15). A secondary object seemed to be to discover what medical and sanitary arrangements the Hejazis were making for the pilgrim age, with discretion, if these were reassuring to use the prospect of persuading a few score Polish Moslems to perform pilgrimage as an inducement to the He azi Government to pay him the desired £50,000 gold. It seems that the visit was inspired by the Polish Charge d’Affaires at Cairo. The Professor left disappointed about equally with Hejazi science and Hejazi finance, CHAPTER IV.— Air Matters. 71. Hejaz Air Force. —This invisible body figures in the Hejaz-Nejd communi cation to the Disarmament Conference, dated the 24th January, as comprising 11 officers and 150 men. The Hejazi Government’s approach to the Turkish Govern ment for the loan of pilots and mechanics has been reported in paragraph 65. 72. The same memorandum gives the number of Hejazi aeroplanes as 9. Only two of these are capable of flying today ; two more might fly after an overhaul and some rebuilding ; the other five will never fly again. 73. Arab Aeronautical Society —A report on the first year’s working published in March does not make encouraging reading. £2,000 was subscribed but not paid. Happily the Society ho’ds promissory notes from all subscribers and expen diture was nil. In spite of d fficulties the society registered its determination to carry on. A new appeal for support is to be issued, rich pilgrims are to be asked to contribute, and propaganda is to be set on foot. Faud Bey Hamza is Vice- President. 74. Emergency Lauding Grounds —On January 24th His Majesty’s Minister took up with the Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs the question of the provision of emergency landing-grounds on the Hasa coast for aircraft in distress on the Persian Gulf route, in accordance with His Majesty's Government’s instructions of December 2nd (November-December report, paragraph 60). He went very fully and tactfully into the matter but found Fuad Bey very sticky. It was evident that he personaUy disliked the whole idea and would like to see Ibn Sa’ud drive a hard bargain, should he agree to His Majesty’s Government’s request. Sir A. Ryan in reporting the interview on January 25th, opined that it was a matter in which Ibn Sa’ud might be more amenable to a direct appeal, but unfortunately there was no prospect of his y'siting Jedda before April at soonest. 75 . On almost the same day tlie Political Resident in the Persian Gulf mention ed the same matter to Ibn Sa'ud himself at Hufuf. The King said that lie was prepared to consider it sympathetically. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin shortly afterwards in T formed Colonel Biscoe that I bn* Sa’ud was now ready to afford any facilities asked for on islands, but not on the mainland, for fear of incidents with Beduin. Certain islands were discussed and Colonel Biscoe suggested to His Majesty's Government that the matter should now be taken up officially. A Rangoon flying-boat which took refuge at Jinna Island in mid-January reported that a land ng ground wa« already marked out and fit for use and staffed with clerks complete with customs forms in Arabic and English for the use of visiting pilots. Only formal permission to use the ground now seemed required, but with the King’s disappearance again into Nejd and in face of Fuad Hamza’s malign influence at the seat of Government, no favourable occasion occurred of pursuing the matter.wmmm 16 67. Acria 1 Trespass. —Squadron-Leader Warburton was lost in the deseit west of Rutta Wells in early January and in order to forestall complaints ol aerial trespass over his territory, Ibn Sa’ud was formally asked for aerial hospitality for the search patrol. This was readily accorded and every asistance promised. Mean while the missing machine was found in ’Iraq. Ibn Sa'ud was thanked. 77 . In mid-January a Rangoon flying-boat force-landed at Jinna Island in the Pers’an Gulf. The Hejaz-Nejd Government were informed and the hope was expressed that there was no objection to the necessary relief measures. They replied that, as a humane duty, they had no objection. Meanwhile a new engine was fitted and all at Jinna were very courteous ; the Hejazi Government were thanked. 78. The Hejaz-Nejd Minister in London informed His Majesty’s Government late in February that a British machine had flown over Qaryat al Milh without permission on the 27th or 28th January, but he did not press the point, nor was the legation troubled. 79 . In March, however, the Hejazi Government weighed in with a formal pro test against three cases of alleged aerial trespass by British aircraft in the same dis trict on February 22nd and 23rd and March 3rd. The matter was referred for enquiry. CHAPTER V. —Military Matters. 80. General —Tbn Sa’ud is his own Minister for War and Commander-in-Chief. It is true that the ‘ Council o Ministers ” decree, annexed goes out of its way to state that the President of the Council controls the Military Departments, but this constitutional change has been denied by a responsible member of the Government. Either he or the decree ‘s wrong, probably the latter. The military Departments comprise a Directorate of Military Affairs (Regulars) under an ex- Turkish corporal, Hamdi Bey ; a Camel-Corps (Irregulars) under a Qaid al Hijan ; and Sheikh Abdu lah Suleyman, who is a^o Director-General of Finance and King’s Comptroller, as Quartermaster-General and Master of Ordnance. 81. Armed Forces. —The Hejaz-Nejd memorandum of January 24th communi cated to the Disarmament Conference at Geneva contained a lengthy dissertation on the Arabian Peninsula. It may be summed up in the opening words of section 8 : “ The natural a nd sccial conditions of this country are so extraordinary that they may be regarded as peculiar to it. This also applies to the military organisa tion.” The following tables were annexed :— TABLE I.— Total Armed Forces. Number of Men. 43,437 Number of Officers 734 Explanatory Notes.

South (Asir).- —Reference to tribal unrest has been made in paragraph 51, but the frontier appears to have been quiet. The Nejdi reinforcements sent to Jizan last September (September-0ctober report, paragraph 45) returned in March by sea, in dhows. CHAPTER VI.— Naval Matters. 87. Commander A. R. Farquhar, D.S.C., R.N., visited Jedda in H. M. S. “ Penzance ” on January 28th. The visit happened to coincide wuth the manu mission by the Legation of a slave claimed by Ibn Sa’ud and proved most timely for his embarkation, under somewhat unusual circumstances, and repatriation to Africa (see Chapter VIII). His Majesty’s Minister left Jedda on February 2nd in H. M. S. “ Penzance ” for Port Sudan, on his way to Jerusalem. 88. The French despatch-vessel “ Dunkerque ” visited Jedda from March 24th to 28th, after paying short visits to Wejh and Yanbu. 89. The Italian minelayer “ Azio ” visited Jedda from February 9th to 11th, for the occasion of the signing of the Italo-Hejazi treaty. CHAPTER VII. — Pilgrimage. 90. General. — By the end of March some 20,000 pilgrims had landed at Jedda, of whom 8,000 were Indians. Pilgrimage Day was due to fall on Friday April 15th, and another 5,000 oversea pilgrims were expected to arrive for it. Last year’s figures were 40,000 in all from oversea. 91. Indian. —Hejazis live on Indians, amongst others. They felt the pinch of a lean season last year and their appetite has recently been sharp. The Hejazi Government have equally suffered the pinch and their practice has become all the sharper. They are an unpleasant species at the best of times ; but when, as during the past 3 months, they begin to make their annual meal in lairs which they call the Holy Sanctuaries, they offered the senses and exercise the mind of interested observers. 92. Last summer they published an official tariff of dues for the 1932 pilgri mage which advertised a reduction of Mutawwifs’ fees. It was scaled in piastres and rupees. They broadcast it through India and beyond in a propaganda pamph let entitled “ Friday Pilgrimage ”, promising the fall of Hajj Day on Friday, April 15th, with consequential sevenfold blessing that day upon God’s Guests. (It may be ntted in parenthesis that it was not the Prophet but the shop and lodging-house keepers of Mecca who invented this wind-fall, 200 years later.) Indian pilgrims were thus led to believe that the 1932 pilgrimage would cost less than that of 1931 and be 7 times as valuable. This was good business. 93. On the basis of the official tariff and other necessary expenditure in the Hejaz, the Legation estimated the total cost of pilgrimage in 1932 to be not less than 800 rupees, and the Government of India were so informed. When the sterling and rupee left gold in the autumn, however, the Hejazi Government made no sign. They maintained a fictitious “ official ” parity with gold but in practice the Sa’udi riyal, which contains 11 Miri piastres, had long ago parted from gold and stood at the end of 1931 at 17 J to the £ gold, parity being 10. There were thus grounds for belief that pilgrims would be able to buy piastres at the market rate and that fees scaled in rupees would be accepted in rupees. But as soon as the first Indian pilgrims landed at Jedda on December 30th, they found that they were charged all dues and fees, including those in rupees, on a gold basis, and were also charged for items which did not figure in the official tariffs at all. They found, in effect, that expenses in the Hejaz were some 40 per cent, higher this year than last. The majority held quite insufficient funds. 94. There followed a series of representations by the Legation and of dilatory, evasive, and contradictory statements by the Hejazi Government. Pilgrims were first told to apply to the local Government at Jedda, who had been instructed to investigate and report. The obvious conclusion was that neither gold basis nor overcharges had been authorised by the Hejazi Government. On January 17th &gt;however the latter answered His Majesty’s Minister’s note of January 2nd with notification that the tariff was fixed on a gold basis and charges must be collected accordingly. The Legation at once informed the Government of India, who issued a press communique on January 23rd warning pilgrims of the change and advising them to estimate the total cost of pilgrimage at 1,100 rupees. 95. The Hejazi Government and others commercially interested in pilgrims made every endeavour in India, through the press and otherwise, to discredit the Government of India’s advice. They succeeded in inducing the majority of pilgrims yet to come that 750 or even 500 rupees would suffice. As a result, several thousand more Indians arrived in Jedda with insufficient means. On discovering their posi tion they clamoured for redress and help from the Legation but we re told that they were themselves largely to blame for trusting the Hejazi Government and agencies rather than their own Government, and were shown the Government of India communique together with a telegram of March 10th sent in clear English, in which His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires described their position to the Government of India, stressed the responsibility of the Hejazi Government for their distress, and asked that the facts be brought to the notice of all intending pilgrims still to come, so that they might come with their eyes open, expecting neither financial assistance from the Legation nor any remission of dues from those who have to live on pilgrims. The Government of India therefore issued a second communique on March 16th based on this telegraim There was a noticeable falling off in the numbers of pilgrims embarked thereafter, the last 2 or 3 ships arriving almost empty at Jedda. 96. It is unnecessary to recount the slipshod prevarications of the Hejazi Government throughout March. They turned chiefly on the official maximum transport charges, which had long been promised, were not made known until March 3rd, and were then invariably exceeded but were officially raised by the Government to cover the excesses as often as these were brought to notice by the Legation. His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires obtained an oral promise from the Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs on March 19th that the maxima would not again be raised and endeavoured to obtain from the Hejazi Government an agreed copy of the charges as finally fixed. This was withheld and the promise went for nothing. Transport conditions and charges have remained chaotic. The experiences of the last 3 months make it imperative to devise means before the next pilgrimage of curbing the appetite of this shamelessly hungry Government. 97. Nigerian .— The desiderata referred to in paragraph 72 of the last report were obtained, thanks to the Sudan Government’s negotiations with the Khedivial Mail Line Company, concluded in January. The Company agreed to issue only return tickets and all the year round, to pilgrims leaving Suakin, with two unobjec tionable provisos, and they further agreed unofficially to consider such tickets valid up to a maximum of 2 years ; a most satisfactory result. 98. The repatriation of 912 destitute Nigerian pilgrims was completed on March 29th (see November-December report, paragraphs 69 to 71). 581 were sent to Massawa and 331 to Suakin. The Pro-Concul at Jedda felt much relieved at the conclusion of this arduous task. 99. Somali .—Recommendations were made by the Legation in March to Sheikh and Aden with a view to improving the control of the Somali pilgrimage. CHAPTER VIIL— Slavery. 100. Bakhit Incident .—Two male slaves, Nigerian and French Sudani by origin, had escaped towards the end of December from Sheykh ’Abdullah Suleyman’s house at Mecca and taken refuge in the Legation. It was intended to manumit them in the normal way and send them to Port Sudan on December 26th. The local authorities, however, under instructions from Mecca, refused to grant the necessary papers to leave the country, on the ground that they were Royal slaves. His Majesty’s Minister made strong representations to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by telephone on December 24th and the opposition to the Nigerian’s depar ture was withdrawn. He claimed with apparent truth to have come on pilgrimage20 in 1930 or 1931 and to have been sold by his master, or companion, into slavery. His case seemed thus to fall under Article 7 of the treaty of Jedda regarding the suppression of slave trade. He was consequently repatriated as intended, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a note of December 26th admitting that he was a free person wrongfully enslaved. 101. The Hejazi Government asked however that Bakhit, the other slave, should be handed over to the local authorities as being a Royal slave. They stated that the fact of his having been with Sheykh 'Abdullah Suleyman was immaterial, as the latter bought all the King’s slaves. Bakhit was therefore retained in the Legation and personally questioned by His Majesty’s Minister. He gave a straight forward and convincing story of having been brought from Africa as a child, at pil grimage time, captured by Beduin outside Jedda, sold in the \emen, sent many years later to Medina, taken when the city fell to Ibn Sa ud s son, sent by him to Ibn Sa’ud’s cousin Ibn Musa’id, and by him to ’Abdullah Suleyman 18 montl s ago. He had had nothing to do with the King. Copies of His Majesty’s Minister’s ques tionnaire and the man’s replies were sent to the Hejazi Government on December 31st. 102. The case developed during January on acute lines which it is unnecessary to describe in detail. The Hejaz-Kejd Minister in London made representations to the Foreign Office. His Majesty’s Minister had a series of patient interviews with the Hejazi Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs in a sustained effort to find a com promise. Fuad Hamza however was uncompromising, became heated, and ev 0 1_ tually lost his head. There seems little reason to doubt that, once armed with Ibn Sa’ud’s claim to have the slave returned, he made no further reference, or inade quate reference, of the course of the affair to the King, who was at Hufuf, with the result that a deadlock was reached. 103. His Majesty’s Government, who were kept fully informed by His Majesty s Minister by telegraph, stated on January 27th that the matter was one of very great importance on which they could not yield. They instructed Sir A. Ryan so to inform the Hejazi Government and promptly to arrange with the Senior Naval Officer, Red Sea Sloops, to embark Bakhit in H.M.JS. “ Penzance”. They added that the matter was so important that, had “ Penzance” not happened to be at Jedda, they would have asked the Admiralty to send a ship for the purpose. 1 hey realised that the embarkation might present practical difficulties, but they gave Sir A Ryan fullest discretion. His Majesty’s Minister accordingly informed the Hejazi Government on January 28th of His Majesty’s Government’s views and their express instructions, which, he added, he was taking the necessary steps to carry out without delay. He asked that the local authorities be informed. 104. After consultation with Commander Farquhar, it was decided to leave the process of embarkation to be carried out on the following afternoon by the Legation staff, openly from the quay in the Legation launch. If and when this attemp failed owing to physical or armed opposition, it would be necessary to consider the need for naval co-operation. The next day was decided upon .in order to give the Hejazi Government time to communicate by wireless with the King But they telegraphed to His Majesty’s Minister the same evening, imme diately on receipt of his note, that they would never agree to the departure of the slave. Sir A. Ryan telegraphed back the following morning that he was sending Bakhit to the sloop that day. 105. The man was duly embarked in the afternoon without difficulty, the doubled Nejdi guard on the quay making no attempt to intervene until too late, when the launch was already under w'eigh ; then they made a futile rus 0 ^ water’s edge and stood there shouting and gesticulating. It was later learner that Fuad Hamza, who is no ordinary Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs, had himself issued standing orders to the police to shoot Bakhit on sight outside the Legation, and particular instructions, in the attempt to embark him, to oppose SirA Ryan if he accompanied the slave in person, without however usmg physical force in the last resort; but if it were Captain Seager (who usually deals with slaves), to resist him by every means at their command. Happily it was Hamadhan am the guard failed to adjust their wits in time to the arrival of Mr. Hope GiU, loilowect by the slave, flanked by Captain Seager who engaged the passport officials, and21 with Mr. Mikeley as rearguard in case an attempt was made to take the man from behind. The Nejdi commanding the guard was summoned to Mecca and imprisoned. 106. The incident delighted Jedda, whose population were only sorry that a landing party had not been used to do the thing in style, but it had a deplorable effect on Ibn Sa’ud’s temper which could certainly have been avoided had Fuad Bey Hamza kept his head. The general opinion was that, had the King been kept fully informed, he would undoubtedly have made a large gesture at the last moment, faute de mieux, and given the slave to Sir A. Ryan, thereby salving some prestige. If he was kept fully informed, his message of the previous day, January 28th, to His Majesty’s Government through Colonel Biscoe was mean ingless (see paragraph 44 above); if he was not, his desire for an intelligent channel of communication would be easily gratified by his replacement of Fuad Hamza by someone intelligent. 107. Other Slaves. —The other male slaves took refuge in the Legation in January and were manumitted and repatriated to Africa early in Febru ary without difficulty. A woman who had been a slave and feared re-enslavement, and a fourth male slave who took refuge in the Legation in February and was manumitted, were also repatriated. Three slaves who escaped from the Amir Feysal’s retinue when he visited Jedda in February were expected to attempt to rea( h the Legation, and the local authorities took elaborate precautions to prevent and find them. They apparently made good their escape by other means and were not found. CHAPTER IX.— ^Miscellaneous. 108. Visitors. —Lady Dorothy Mills, known to some as “ uneaten and un beaten ”, explored Jedda from January 12th to 15th and was accommodated in the Legation. Prominent pilgrims will be noted in the next report. 109. Deportations. —Mubarik ’Ali was deported on January 25th by the Hejazi Government in response to the Legation’s request (see November-December report, paragraph 80). A misguided disciple named Mirza Suleiman Ahmed was made to accompany him. 110 . Staff. —His Majesty’s Minister left Jedda on the 2nd February in H. M. S. “ Penzance ” for Port Sudan on an official visit to Jerusalem, to discuss Trans jordan matters with His Majesty’s High Commissioner. Mr. Hope Gill became Charg4 d’Affaires. The Indian Vice-Consul, Munshi Ihsanullah, received the well-merited title of Khan Bahadur on January 1st. The Malay Pilgrimage Officer returned to Jedda for the season on February 28th.

Ibn Sd’ud. —The King left Riyadh at 9 a.m. on April 5th by car for Mecca, preceded on the previous day by the baggage convoy and a mobile wireless set. He was met on the 7th by the Amir Feysel at ’Usheyra and by large members of Meccawis at as-Seyl, where he performed the major ablution and clad himself in two seamless wrappings, the “ ihram ” of the pilgrim. He entered Mecca (550 miles) at sunset on April 7th, one week before pilgrimage day. At 7 next morning he was ceremoniously received by the Viceroy in the centre of the town, in a setting of awnings and troops and popular acclamation, the while a salute of 101 guns was fired and speeches and poems eulogised His Majesty. There, by royal command, the celebrations ended, in the interests of national economy. 112. Ibn Sa’ud was immediately surrounded by the multifarious cares of maladministration and the grievances of pilgrims. An unusually large number of prominent Indians was present for the Friday Haj, and them he heard with some attention. On April 12th he made a banquet for 500 guests and delivered his customary pilgrimage oration. It was a mediaeval mixture of religion and politics, spoken from a full heart but a bewildered head ; it caused much offence. 113. Starting with the aphorism (in such company) that one of the greatest blessings of God to man is the blessing of Islam, Ibn Sa’ud ascribed the decline of Moslem temporal power to the decadence of Moslem religious faith and the re sulting disunity between Moslem peoples. God had therefore empowered their enemies over them. But Moslems now were awaking from sleep and inadvertance. They should seize their weapons, which were of two kinds, the material, such as aeroplanes, the spiritual, piety. By these would they win glory in this world and pardon in the next. Here he inserted the remark that the Prophet of God had recommended the learning of foreign languages as a means of power over the enemy. Ibn Sa’ud then turned to his own position and that of the Hejaz. If the relations between me and God are good, he said, I do not care if the relations be tween me and all men are bad. A man can only do his best—in the general interest, he added. People had been talking too much about the Hejaz and its people and criticising them only because they believed in God Almighty. The Hejaz was once under the Turks and then under the Sherifs. His hearers were aware of the bloodshed then done, the sins committed, and the peace violated. But when God made Ibn Sa’ud the ruler of the Hejaz, being a salve of God, he followed no way but that of true religion the Holy Book between his hands. Two things he would never allow, were all the world to fight against him. namely the slightest deviation from the religion of God or any action affecting the independence or violating the honour of his country. People often asked, why did Ibn Sa’ud not strive to defend the Moslems by propaganda against the English, the Russians, the Italians and the rest ? He would tell them. He was not a wordy man but a man of deeds. He did not instruct the editor of his newspaper to speak against such a one, but he commanded silence until the time of action came ; when he acted, then he spoke. Hitherto he had kept still, not knowing the state of Moslem opinion, or rather the opinion of those who pretended to be Moslems. Here Ibn Sa’ud began to betray his bewilderment. When Moslems speak against Chris tians, he said, they speak politely and with good manners, but when they speak against Moslems, they accuse them as though they were their enemies. “ There are some who have acted vindictively against us, looking with evil eye upon what God has granted us ; thus the devil tempted them to many evil deeds. Not in one single case did I find one of the Moslems defending me. Moslems withheld the charities from the Holy Sanctuaries and Moslems prevented people from performing pilgrimage. All this is against Ibn Sa’ud. What has Ibn Sa’ud done ? Has lb Sa’ud erected an idol to be worshipped in place of God ? Has he allowed intoxicating drink ? Has he permitted adultery and prostitution ? Has Ibn Sa’ud left the mischievous to commit evil upon earth ? What has Ibn Sa’ud done contrary to the Shar’fa law and Arab manliness. By God, he said, I fear the foreigner once but I fear those who pretend to be Moslem three thousand times. I hope Moslems will forgive me for saying so, but, by God, I am true in MC228FD u2 what I say ”, What had Moslems agreed upon and striven for, Ibn Sa’ud asked, and he had hesitated to join them ? He had no use for words, but if Moslems went forth to action, it would be disgraceful for their honour, theirs, the Arabs, if they failed to do the same. But he did not go on to indicate any plan of action ; instead, he turned aside to ventilate other grievances. He was censured for lack of rain in the Hejaz, lie was said to be contracting a loan with the English, he was accused of wanting to do this and that. But he had taken nothing from the Hejaz ; on the contrary he had given it peace and religious law. Almighty God withheld the rain, but upon Moslems lay the disgrace of withholding charity and preventing pilgiimage (icgarded, of course, as ever in the Hejaz, primarily as commercial assets). By God, he oontinuedfl have no money and my only possessions are the sw ord and the Qii ran. I declare openly that if any of the Moslem kings, princes, or merchants wishes to do a benevolent deed for the Moslems of this country, he is warmly welcome, provided that he does not violate the honour of our country nor interfere with our independence or our religious affairs. I swear by God, the only One God, that I have not contracted a loan with the English or others—-but perhaps we may need to take from the Moslems, or others/ tU Here is a very fair indication of Ibn Sa’ud’s state of mind. He is at his wits’ end to obtain money sufficient for his expensive needs. Moreover he is feeling insecure and his words reflect his growing sense of the hostility which surrounds him m the Hejaz and which is spreading in the Moslem world outside. His reactions are alternately those of a man of action who would like to hit somebodv and a pious begger for unconditional alms. But his enemies, though real to 'him, are impalpable, while benevolent Moslems are looking askance at his fanatical des truction of their shrines and his spendthrift maladministration of the Holy Hejaz. 115. After prilgrimage, Ibn Sa’ud visited Jedda on April 30th but stayed only a day and left on May 2nd. He started the leading inhabitants who assembled to pay homage to him at the Green Palace by greeting them with the words “ I could cut the throat of every one of you ”. The foreign representatives were received in audience one by one on May 1st. His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires found 1 bn Sa md polite but distant and with very little to say. He looked a different man from w'hat he had been 18 months before, his face yellowed under the skin pouchy, puckered, and far more livid ; his ill-health was evident. 116. Viceroy of the Hejaz.—The Amir Feysal left on April 12th on a mission to Europe (paragraphs 53 and 127) and was replaced by Ibn Sa’ud’s third son Muhammad, aged 22, as President of the Council and Viceroy-to-be. IV Ministry of Foreign 4//hu&gt;s.—Sheykh Yusuf Yasin at the same time be came Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs. Fuad Bey Hamza accompanied the Minister for Foreign Affairs on mission. Current affairs in April were dealt with by letter and telephone to Mecca : there were no interviews. 118. Finance^ The Hejazi Government made a further attempt in April to silence the persistent loan rumour (paragraph 11) which the Arabic and Indian vernacular press kept on repeating. They announced in the “ Umm-al-Oura ” ot April 15th that the crisis m the Hejaz was only a part of the general world &lt; epression ; they denied definitely that they had consulted the British or any other Government about a loan, the rumoured conditions of which (appointment of an Englishman to reorganize and control all finances, settlement of the Hejaz railway question and use of Hejaz-Nejd territory by British aircraft) were such as the Government could never accept; they foretold a conference of local financial experts and oftered to assist anyone who might wish to be charitable to the Heiaz • thev promise facilities to any Moslem, were he king or prince or merchant, who wanted no/touched 1 &amp; ° an ’ pr ° Vlded that their ri S ht3 ’ reli S ion and independence were 119. The financial position was unchanged. The Dutch adviser Mr Van Beeuwen, arrived at Jedda on April 23rd on contract for a year (paragraph 62) 120 Economy.—The pilgrimage, though very small, brought a little business and relief to the town populations of the Hejaz. The Beduin however continued in miserable plight As a result of the draught, the Northern Hejaz was said to be entirely empty of tribes, who had moved in search of grazing either northward into ra , n , s ' dor , l ' aD or southward beyond Taima. Pilgrims to Medina were frequently mobbed by starvmg nomads. 1 ^3 CHAPTER II— Frontier Questions. T: arts-Jordan. 121. Baiding .—There were no complaints during April of raiding from either side of the frontier. 122 . Frontier Meetings. —None are reported to have been held in April 123. The Beni 'Aliya. —Under instructions from His Majesty’s Government, His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires on April 22nd replied to the Hejazi Government's note of the 9th March (paragraph 38) to the effect that the Trans-Jordan Govern ment regretted that they could not see their way to complying with the request for the return of the Beni 'Atiya to the Hejaz. It was pointed out that it had been in a spirit of co-operation, however, and in order to minimise the risk of trouble arising on the frontier, that the Trans-Jordan authorities had taken measures to control these tribesmen as soon as they crossed the frontier and had sent them to the north of Ma’an. 'Iraq. 124. Nil. Kuwait and Bahrain. 125. Nil 'Ash and the Yemen. 126. Ibn Sa’ud sent a telegram of condolence to the Imam Yahya on the death of his second son, Saif-al-Islam Muhammad, on April 22nd. CHAPTER III.— Foreign Relations. British Empire. 127. Hejaz-Nejd Mission to London. —Under circumstances which have al ready been recorded in paragraph 53, the Amir Feysal accompanied by Fuad Bey Hamza sailed from Jedda on April 12th to visit London and other capitals. A touching scene was witnessed at the gangway, when the Amir’s favourite was found on board and bundled off. It had been officially concluded that it would be incorrect if he were to accompany the mission, but the Amir had surreptitiously given him passage money at the last moment. Though full grown, he howled like a child. Another attache, a well known prostitute of Mecca, had left by a previous sailing for Port Said, where she intended to join the Amir. It has not yet been ascertained whether she fared better than her rival. Italy. 128. The mission sailed in an Italian liner, specially diverted to Jedda for the purpose, and was accompanied by the Italian Consul and Madame Sollazzo, whose duty at Jedda had terminated with the signing of the Italo-Hejazi treaty (para graph 59). The mission arrived at Naples on April 18th as guests of the Italian Government. They were received there on the 19th by the Crown Prince of Italy and proceeded the same day to Rome. The Amir was received by King Victor Emmanuel on the 20th and stayed to luncheon. On the 21st he attended the celebration of the anniversary of the foundation of Rome and was frequently photographed in company with Signor Mussolini. The mission left Rome on April 25th, visited the Fiat motor and aviation works at Turin on the 26th and the Trade Fair at Milan on the 27th, and passed on to Switzerland. The Italian authorities appear to have made every effort to impress the mission with I talian efficiency in the industrial field. For their views on the slave trade see paragraph 147. The Netherlands. 129. The Dutch Charge d’Affaires, M. Adriaanse, returned to Jedda on April 5th from the Yemen, where he spent 10 days as the guest of the Tmam Yahya at San’a. He received yet another courtesy letter from Queen Wilhelmina. 130. The Dutch financial adviser, M. van Leeuwen, arrived at Jedda on April 23rd (paragraph 62). 'Iraq. 131. King Faisal's personal message to Ibn Sa'ud regarding the seat of the new Iraqi Legation (paragraph 67) arrived by special courier in April. After several4 and friendly interviews with the ’Iraqi Charge d’Affaires, Ibn Sa’ud sent a reply in which, it seems, he regretted that~he could not infringe the rule which preserves the Holy Places of Islam intact from diplomacy, and invited King Faisal to furnish his representative with fresh credentials naming him to Jedda. CHAPTER IV.—Am Matters. 132. Hejaz Air Foice. —Nil. 133. Emergency Landing Grounds. —There was no opportunity in April of pursuing the matter. 134. Aerial Trespass. —None was reported. CHAPTER V.— Military Matters. 135. Nat them Hejaz. —The drought-stricken northern tribeslands were appa rently deserted and at peace. 136. East (Nejd). —Nothing to report. 137. South (’Asir). —News was received via Aden to the effect that, as a result of renewed trouble between the Sa’udi control at Jizan and certain ’Asiri tribes r the Amir Bin Shu’air had been recalled from Jizan and replaced by the Amir Bin Zu’air from Qunfida. CHAPTER VI.— Naval Matters. 138. Naval Visits. —The customary naval visit during the pilgrimage was paid by Captain C. S. Sandford, O.B.E., R.N., Senior Naval Officer, Red Sea Sloops, who visited Jedda for the first time on April 12th in H.M.S. “ Hastings ” The visit lasted until April 18th, pilgrimage day falling on the 15th. It was an unqualified success, which was largely due to the Navy’s own genial hospitality and their effective co-operation with the shore and the pilgrimage fleet in the running of the traditional Haj Regatta. The usual official visits were paid by Captain Sandford, His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires and the Governor of Jedda receiving salutes when they returned his visits. 139. There were no foreign naval visits. CHAPTER VII.— Pilgrimage. 140. Pilgrimage Day. —The 9th Dau’l Hijja did coincide with a Friday (the 15th April). The 50,000 or so Hajis who assembled upon that day in the plain of ’Arafat were thus seven times blessed (for why, see paragraph 92). The shade temperature was then not more than 102-F., deaths were few, and the general health all that could be desired. In announcing this happy circumstance, the Hejazi Government were moved to declare that the congregation that day num bered not less than 150,000. This may be ascribed as much to ignorance as to ecstasy. The desert so seldom teems that the Arab has but little knowledge of large numbers. 141. Arrivals. —The official Hejazi statistics of oversea pilgrims, which are not necessarily accurate, show some 29,000 this year as against 39,500 last year. made up as follows :— Nationality. Last year. This year. Indians 7,200 9,500 Javanese 17,000 4,500 Egyptians 5,000 2,300 Syrians 1,000 2,100 North Africans .. 250 1,800 Afghans 1,000 1,700 Palestinians ,. 500 1,300 Bukharis 200 1,200 The Rest .. 7,350 4,600 Total ,. 39,500 29,0005 \ % t i 142. The financial and economic depression has thus decisively outweighed the attraction of the Friday Haj. Total approximate figures of oversea pilgrims to Mecca in recent years have been. 1927 1928 1929 1930 1931 1932 1,32,000 88,000 82.500 85.000 39.500 29.000 There was a larger attendance tins year than has before been known of notable pilgrims from oversea, however. The names of some of these are given in para graph 149. 143. No Hejazi statistics of local or overland pilgrims are kept. In fact they are not called pilgrims at all, but the Arabic equivalent of tramp or hoboe, since they bring no money into the country. Such are the Yemenis, of whom 5,000 are said to have come to Mecca this year. The estimated total of these and more local pilgrims is 20,000. 144. Departwe—There was an exceptional glut of pilgrims at Jedda during the last part of April. The slender funds of the majority were exhausted by hi^h prices and extortion. The great idea was to get away by the first boat availabfe. Large numbers moreover were unable to afford the visit to Medina, which is gene rally paid after the pilgrimage to Mecca. Consular and shipping staffs have con sequently been working since April 20th at considerably higher pressure than usual, in spite of the smaller pilgrimage. 145. Haj Regcjata .—Another successful meeting was added on April 17th to the long list of Haj Regattas with which, since before living memory, the waiting pilgrim ships and the European community of Jedda have filled in the time while the Moslems are in Mecca. The oldest captain could remember a time when 42 ships lay at anchor. This year there were only 8, seven British and one French. The usual Regatta meeting was held at the British Legation, the usual luncheon on board the Regatta flagship, S.S. “ Boulac ”, and a programme of nine pulling and sailing events was carried through harmoniously, with the valuable assistance of H.M.S. “Hastings ”. Ships were dressed overall on April 16th to 19th for the four days’ pilgrimage festival, the Td-al-Zoha. Salutes, however, are only fired by the shore battery, which fired them incessantly. CHAPTER VIII.— Slavery. 141. Manumissio'ns .—One male and two female slaves who took refuge in the Legation in April were manumitted on the 20th and repatriated to the Sudan, their country of origin. 147. Slave Trade .—The signature of the Italo-Hejazi treaty (paragraph 59) was accompanied by an exchange of letters, in the first of which the Italian pleni potentiary opined that his Government considered it necessary that Ibn Sa’ud’s Government should assume the obligation of co-operating with them in suppressing the slave trade. Similarly his Government desired that their representatives at Jedda should have powers of manumission and repatriation. They trusted that Ibn Sa’ud would appreciate their attitude. The slave-owners’ representative replied, however, that while appreciating the Italian Government’s humane sentiments, he had to explain that the suppression of the illicit trade in slaves constituted one of the most important question to which Ibn Sa’ud’s Government had directed their attention, that His Majesty was personally interested in preventing the im port of slaves into his country, and that his Government would persevere to this end. As to manumission, the Government were themselves of their own initiative en deavouring to reach the end enjoined by Islamic law, with its principles of supreme justice and its pure sentiment of humanity. They could not grant powers of manumission to the Italian representative because such action was their own sole and exclusive right. This Italian face-saving and Hejazi clap trap will no doubt be published with the treaty as evidence of good faith on both sides. A further exchange of notes agreed that the most-favoured nation treatment accorded to Italy by the Hejaz-Nejd did not include the “ favourable treatment which, for reasons which are generally known, has been granted to a third Power in the omatter of slavery ”—the British right of manumission secured by the Treaty of Jedda. 148. Nevertheless Aden has received a report that on April 10th a slave boy of 14 was brought to Jizan-r-he is thought to have been landed on the Subeyhi Coast East of. Perim and to have beeji brought overland into.’Asir—and was kept in the house of. a local Sheykh for sale.. Thereupon, ft. was said, certain merchants interested in the slave trade enquired,of the Aniir of Jizan—whether the old or the new is not stated—whether he would encourage and facilitate a revival of the import business. He is said to have promised to do so. Other reports received at Aden state that two slaves were .landed at Mocha in March. 1931 and one in October 1931, and that at the be^inhing’hf 'March 1932 four slaves, a man, a woman, and two boys, were landed at Dubab and taken overland to Zabid, where they were bought by one Muhammad Ibrahim Meccawi for 2,000 Maria Theresa dollars, i he man and one boy were said to have been sent later to Shariff Ibrahim ar- Rifa'i at Midi for sale.

Staff. —Mr. F. V. Jones, Legation Archivist for the past 2 years, left Jedda on April 29th but died on May 1st, aged 27, on his way home for his first leave; he was buried at Tor. He had been weakened by the climate and recent attacks of influenza and malaria, and succumbed to a 24-hour attack of double pneumonia. His loss has been keenly felt.

The unfavour able impression formed by His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires of his physical state is recorded in the previous report (paragraph 115). It is in striking contrast 6499 [542 c—3] Bwith that formed in January by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, who found His Majesty hale, hearty and young for his age. He dislikes all Hejazi climates as being too hot, too damp or too dry. He had just been through the strenuous labours of the pilgrimage, and he has had the problems of the Hejaz increasingly in his mind and on his nerves. These factors may well account for ms appearance on the 1st May. There is no reason to suppose that his health is peimanently impaired. It may be mentioned in this connexion that an American doctor from the mission hospital at Bahrein left for Taif on the M)th May in response to an urgent summons, but it is supposed that he was pi mcipally lequired to attend a wife about whose health the King has been much concerned. The doctor was still at Taif late in June, and appeared to be greatly in demand among the notables there. Ibn Sand left Jedda on the 2nd May, sooner than had been anticipated. He moved to Taif on the 22nd May, and was still there at the end of June. He had been expected to go to Nejd in the course of that month, but was doubtless influenced to delay his departure by the situation in the Northern Hejaz (see below). It is, indeed, somewhat remarkable that he did not proceed to some spot neaier the scene of action, e.g., Medina. It has been suggested in some quarters that the unruly tribes round Taif have been so restless that the King’s presence in that area is necessary to control the situation. 155. The King created a sensation by a speech which he delivered to a gathenng of notables at Mecca on the eve of his departure. It was in his usual fervent vein, and resembled in many respects the address recorded in the last report (paragraph 113), but its special quality was that of a cautionary sermon to the Hejaz is. Ihis note is struck in the version published in the “ Umm-al- Gura. According to private reports, His Majesty was much more outspoken than appeared from that version. He is said to have talked of chopping off heads as a remedy which he had thought of applying at once to the corruption which he rebuKed. He had decided to content himself with a warning addressed more particularly to those in high places, including his own officials, and to people of the middle class; he could excuse persons of the meaner sort for their share m the exploitation of pilgrims, which would appear to have been one of the objects of the onslaught. Another was the goings-on of the young men, whose leanings towards modern political ideas and European materialism the King deprecates 156. Such utterances are part of the King’s reaction to the growing unpopularity of his rdgime in the towns. The malaise was intensified in June by distorted accounts of what was passing in the north, and companion rumours of unrest in the Taif region, perhaps also in Asir. One arrest in Mecca probably Iw '/^.“xioii with the theory of a widespread Hashimite conspiracy that of Faudhi Ley Kawokji, who was removed last year, after a short tenure from the post of Director-General of Military Organisation. The Government have shown other signs of nervous suspicion. Tribal notables are said to have been arrested at Taif or Mecca. Laughter was aroused by the action of the director of police m the latter city in filling the town with armed men at mid night, with no greater object it subsequently appeared, than to locate illicit alcohol, a small quantity of which was discovered. More anxiety was caused when on the night of the 28th June some forty people were arrested in Jedda. I he majority were released at once and some others later, but a fair number e ? 1 f ia f te f ( [’ Were held m custody. The bag was so mixed that it was difficult to detect the common factor. Some suppose that these proceedings are merely intended to instil a general fear. The public execution in Jedd£ of a tnbes r n n 0 I V he ^ ^ ma y have fortified impression although he seems to ha\e deserved his fate, and was interesting only because he had made a spirited get-away from gaol across the reefs and shallows outside the town. It is said that it took three minutes to hack off his head, and that his wife and children were compelled to attend as a counter-agent to possible heredity but these details cannot be vouched for. * p e neieait y&gt; f i (° r the y°. un g men &gt; interest has centred round the question whether football, latterly much m vogue at Jedda and Mecca, is now prohibited or not The game can hardly be held to be forbidden by the sacred law. The Prophet is said to have played ball with his ladies, and the Amir Feisal played the modern game early this year in Jedda^ It is not the football itsel/which has fallen under suspicion but the fact that it brings young men together in clubs One of those interested explained gravely about the end of June that the' Kingdeferring to the views of a liberal entourage, had not prohibited the game, but that it was uncertain whether those who persisted in playing it might not be arrested. 1 he sportsmen’s dilemma is the more difficult for having not quite visible horns. 158. Some little importance may attach to suggestions that all is not well between the Amir Feisal and the King. It has been suggested that the Amir will be detained in Riyadh on his return from his tour. He himself spoke to Sir A. Ryan in London in May of the possibility of his being delayed there. One story is that the Amir has made the removal of Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman from office a condition of his continuing to serve as Viceroy; another, that he has come under the influence of a strong-minded new wife of half-Turkish parentage, who has determined to make a man of him. The interest of such reports, unauthen ticated as they are, lies in the fact that the Amir, with his local experience, his European experiences, and his penchant for modern-minded Syrians, might well aspire to a dominant role in a distressful Hejaz. 159. The very youthful Amir Muhammad, who was appointed to act for the Amir Feisal as President of the Council, &amp;c., left for Riyadh after a short incumbency, and was replaced by his still more youthful brother the Amir Khalid. Ministry for Foreign Affairs. 160. Sheikh Tusuf Yasin continued to act as Minister throughout May and June in the absence of the Amir Feisal and Fuad Bey Hamza. He visited Jedda from the 30th x\pril to the 7th May, the 25th May to the 27th May, the 2 nd June to the 6th June, the 10th to the 14th and the 21st to the 27th. The Ministry now maintains a permanent branch in Jedda to the extent of having on duty Sheikh Ali Taha, who was formerly assistant to the Governor of Jedda. He was ineffective in that capacity, and is a complete nonentity in the Foreign Affairs Department. He is, however, a useful postman, especially as he takes. d_elivery of notes on which the Legation formerly had to pay postage to Mecca and he has been the medium for the transmission of cypher messages both ways by telephone in connexion with the Ibn Rifada affair (see belowh Hejazi Constitution. 161. Mr. Hope Gill completed in May a compilation from all available sources of all known regulations affecting the Constitution of the Hejaz since 1926. Despite the incoherent manner in which constitutional changes have been effected, this collection is of great importance and it is therefore worth recording that it was sent to the Foreign Office in Legation despatch No. 213 of the 18th May, 1932. Finance. 162. There was no material change in the current financial situation. The Dutch financial adviser worked busily on reports. He appears to enjoy life, being happily not dependent on his salary and having no intention of outstaying the year of his contract. He is very discreet as to what he is doing, but makes no secret of the difficulty of dealing with a Minister who resides in Mecca, and pays only short and infrequent visits to Jedda. 165. On the 17th June the Hejazi Government published a decree insti tuting revised arrangements for settling old debts. It began by saying that those which were the subject of agreements would be paid according to these agreements. Arrears due to soldiers, policemen and chauffeurs would be paid by issuing supplies in kind monthly in addition to current wages; rents in accordance with the special regulations on the delayed payment of rents (see paragraph 173). Twenty-five per cent, of the customs revenue would be assigned to the payment of all other debts, for which drafts on customs would be issued in cases where this had not already been done. Government employees and other persons not in the import trade would arrange with a named importing merchant in whose name the drafts would be issued. The wording of these clauses is obscure, but the effect appears to be that all debts not dealt with otherwise must be converted into d'rafts on customs to be accepted in payment of one-fourth of the duty on newly-imported goods. The discount market for such drafts is extremely poor, as might be expected. Otherwise, it is too soon to appreciate the practical effect of the new regulation. [542 c—3] B 24 164. The position in regard to all important claims in which the Legation is interested remained vague and unsatisfactory. Mr. Hope Gill pressed some of them in May, notably the Egyptian Shell claim in respect of stolen benzine and the claim of His Majesty’s Government for the Hejazi contribution to the cost of the MacDonnell enquiry. Sir A. Ryan reviewed most of the claims in general conversation with the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs towards the end of June, but did not press the individual cases owing to the predominance of the of the Transjordan frontier question over all other matters. Earlier in June the long-suffering chauffeurs employed in the Government companies had been offered one-third of their claims in full settlement, and Sir A. Ryan had informed Sheikh Yusuf Yasin on the 12th June that he could not encourage British chauffeurs to accept so miserable an offer, but would not stand in the w T ay of its being voluntarily accepted, subject to the provisos that he would regard the claims of any who refused the offer as being valid for the full amount and that he would expect any who accepted to be left free to leave the country when they had discharged their E rivate debts. This intimation did not prevent the authorities concerned from oodwinking some simple chauffeurs into accepting the offer by telling them that it had been arranged with the Legation. 165. The Hejazi Mission appealed to His Majesty’s Government to make a loan of £500,000 gold or to help them to raise one. They w^ere told that His Majesty's Government regretted their inability to comply with the request, and it w r as further explained to them at a meeting at the Bank of England on the 13th May that the conditions were wholly unfavourable for raising a loan in the City of London. The mission presumably made similar efforts in other western capitals—at any rate they tried Berlin. On the 19th June, Sheikh Yusuf Yasin delivered to Sir A. Ryan a personal message from Ibn Saud renewing his appeal for financial assistance on a much smaller scale than the mission had suggested. The Soviet, he explained, w’ere willing to lend him anything up to a million—in goods not in money. He did not wish to accept this help or to comply with the Soviet conditions that he should conclude a treaty with them. He might be driven to this course, though even if he w 7 ere he would confine the treaty w ithin narrow limits. His Majesty's Government could only confirm their previous refusal, but did it in the friendliest possible terms. Representatives of the lower types of high finance visited Jedda. The “ Amir ” Lutfullah came from Egypt towards the end of May to pursue his project of an Arabian National Bank and was entertained at Taif. He left Jedda on the 4th June not having accomplished anything definite. A representative of the ex-Khedive of Egypt brought about the same time offers of financial assistance in return for a banking concession and/or economic concessions. It w'as said that definite proposals were to be communicated to the Hejazi Government on the 5th July. There may also have been a financial side to the activities of Mr. Ydlibi, to be described in the following sub-section. 166. There was an echo from India in May of the stale rumour that His Majesty’s Government w r ere about to lend the Hejazi Government £500,000 on various conditions including the provision of landing grounds on the Hasa Coast. It had been reproduced in Bombay with comments relative to alleged British designs on the Holy Places. His Majesty’s Government concurred in a proposal that a formal denial should be issued by the Government of India, but without reference to the reported conditions, as the question of landing grounds was in fact under discussion with the Hejazi Government, though on quite different lines. Economic Development. 167. Mr. Twitchell was again in Jedda during the greater part of May and left towards the end of the month. It is understood that during this visit he w^as in the pay of the Hejazi Government and not, as previously, of Mr. Crane. It is, however, uncertain whether he will return to the Hejaz in view of the unfavour able turn in the King’s disposition towards him. His colleague, Mr. Moseley, who was prospecting for gold near Taif until he left in March, has not reappeared, but hopes of exploiting gold somewhere or other are still entertained and seem to have infected even the Dutch financial adviser. This gentleman is also impressed by the possibilities of the wmter from the Waziriya wells outside Jedda, but it is not confirmed that he supported a mad proposal which was spoken of in May to close down the Jedda condensers in anticipation of more successful efforts to bring the Waziriya water to the town—the idea apparently being that the failure of theseefforts hitherto has been due to sabotage by other interests and that there would be less danger of this, if the condenser water was not available. 168. Mr. Hope Gill was able to send home on the 18th May further infor mation regarding Mr. Twitchell’s explorations on the Hasa Coast together with a copy of a “ somewhat testy ” letter which he addressed to the King on the 27th February, regarding his efforts generally and various causes militating against their success in spite of the possibilities of the country. 169. Men of larger and vaguer ideas than those of Mr. Twitched floated about in May and June. Reference has been made in paragraph 165 to the approaches made to the Hejazi Government by the Amir Lutfullah and an agent of the ex-Khedive. Another gentleman, who puts economic development in the forefront of his dreams and schemes, is Mr. A. Ydlibi, the enterprising head of a small business in Manchester. Having spied out the land in Jedda in January and February in association with another Syrian, named Awaini, an intimate of Fuad Bey Hamza, he appears to have gone home and to have sought to enlist interest in oil and possible railway concessions in the Hejaz. From a statement made by Sheikh Yusuf Yasin on the 24th June, it seems that Mr. Ydlibi claims to have got the support of the Calico Printers’ Association, (Limited), who had, however, according to the same statement, been given discouraging advice by His Majesty’s Government. The true facts of what had passed in England were not known in Jedda up to the end of June. 170. It was announced on the 9th May that the Hejazi Government had arranged to import an adequate supply of agricultural machinery to be distributed to farmers in the Hejaz and Nejd and to be paid for by them in annual instalments. Wireless. 171. There was no news of any further stations being completed in May and June, but the Marconi expert, M. Boucicault, is understood to have gone to Hasa to work in that area. It is not certain that he completed the station at Qaf before leaving as was supposed (see January-March report, paragraph 16). Postal Communication. 172. Following on Sir H. V. Biscoe’s conversations with Ibn Saud in January, th§ Government of India agreed in principle in May to the establish ment of a postal service between Hasa and the outer world via Bahrein, and communicated to the Legation, for transmission to the Hejazi Government, their proposals as to how it should be organised. Legislation on Rents. 173. A regulation published on the 6th May affirmed the right of landlords to dispose freely of their property by contract. It, however, prescribed that, in cases of non-agreement with their tenants, they could not evict the latter before the 6th June, 1932, and it established a moratorium for arrears of rent, which were made payable in two instalments in December 1932 and December 1933 at the rate of 10 rivals to the pound (i.e., the pound gold). Census. 174. A regulation published on the 24th June, after a certain amount of preliminary publicity, including an assurance that the measure had nothing to do with conscription or taxation, ordered a general census of the male population of the Hejazi towns. It was clear that one of the main objects was to determine the numbers of natives and foreigners, and the regulation, though unexception able in principle, created much misgiving among people of doubtful or dual nationality, many of whom seemed likely to be swayed more by considerations of interest than by ideas as to their legal status in filling up the declaration of nationality in the forms distributed. They were the more unhappy because of the difficulty of deciding between the risks, great each way, of admitting themselves to be Hejazis or claiming to be aliens. The Rub-al-Khali. 175. The “ Umm-al-Qura ” of the 13th and 20th May had two long articles on the Rub-al-Khali, with special reference to Mr. Philby’s journey. This is6 represented as having been a sort of pendant to the despatch by the Amir of Hasa of a force sent to pursue certain criminals not accounted for by an earlier expedition of the same kind a year before and to collect information. The first article reproduces an interesting letter from Mr. Philby to the King asking permission to take the opportunity afforded by the despatch of the force subject to the following undertakings :— (1) No responsibility to attach to the King and his Government, and no claim to lie against them in the event of Mr. Philby’s death or illness. (2) All information obtained to be communicated to the Hejazi Government, to be their property and not to be published without their permission. (3) Ihe British Government to have no right to claim anything in consequence of discoveries made by Mr. Philby, and all territory discovered, as well as information obtained, to be Ibn Sand’s property. (4) Mr. Philby and the King’s servants to place his “ flags of victorv ” in all high places passed by. (5) All remains discovered and all plans and maps made to be the property of the Hejazi Government and not to be disposed of without the King’s authority, and a list of all funds to be submitted to the King, for such orders as he might choose to issue, on Mr. Philby’s return. The articles then describe how the punitive expedition going first rounded up the remaining criminals, “who had their hands and legs cut off,” and how the mission, i.e., Mr. Philby s party, continued on its journey via Jabrin and Maqamama to the alleged site of the legendary city of Ubar. 176. In this connexion it may be mentioned that Mr. Philby went to England in May to reap a rich harvest of laurels. Before doing so he closed down for six months the Jedda branch of Sharqieh (Limited), his management of which has been less brilliant than his undoubtedly fine feat of explorations. Chapter II. —Frontier Questions. Transjordan. Frontier Situation. 177. No raids in the ordinary sense were complained of by either side during May and June, excepting two which the Hejazi Government mentioned in a note of the 14th May (see below) as haying occurred in April. These they cited, admittedly without having full particulars, as examples of the way in which the Beni Atiya, whom they suspected of the raids, were encouraged by their acceptance in J ransjordan to engage in nefarious enterprise. Peace reigned on the frontier during the first twenty days of May. There were no meetings between Captain Glubb and Ibn Zeid. Even the diplomatic atmosphere was clear until the Legation received on the 15th May the Hejazi note of the previous day. 178. This note was a long and contentious reply to Mr. Hope Gill’s short one of the 22nd April about the Beni Atiya (see last report, paragraph 123), but its subsequent importance lay in a passage dealing with an extraneous subject, the alleged activities of one Hamid-bin-Rifada-al-Awar, who was stated to be working in Egypt under the instructions of the Amir Abdullah, to be giving money to fugitive Hejazi tribesmen, and to be sending them to Aqaba in order that they should return to their homes, there to await future operations. The Hejazi Government had learnt that the Amir would help these people with money and troops when necessary, and that there were parties at Aqaba suborned to prepaie foi opeiations directed against the peace of the Hejaz. The note asked that a decision should be taken regarding the Beni Atiya, as to whether thev belonged to the Hejaz and should be expelled from Transjordan, or vice versa; that a settlement should be reached with Transjordan on the lines of the agree ment concluded between Hejaz-Nejd and Iraq; and that an explanation should be furnished regarding the arrangements made by the Amirate of Transjordan to provoke disturbance in the Aqaba-Maan area. 179. The Hejazi note presented no urgent appearance. Mr. Hope Gill ^ n J wered ^ l en &amp;th on the 22nd May, asking the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs to elucidate many points, including the serious but vague allegations mthe paragraph about Ibn Rifada. He sent copies of the correspondence to London and Jerusalem by bag. Four days later General Wauchope reported that a party of from 200 to 400 Billi and other tribesmen had passed through Aqaba on their way from Sinai to the Hejaz. A further report, dated a day or two later, said that the party, now estimated at from 400 to 450 men, had passed north of Aqaba on the night of the 20th-21st May, had proceeded to a place some 7 kilom. from the frontier and had moved further south next day. It appeared from an order or proclamation issued by the Amir Abdullah immediately on the receipt of the first news that the leader was Ibn Rifada. The Amir intimated that these people, who were said to expect his help,should be made to return to their families and that steps should be taken to prevent the passage through Transjordan of suspicious characters. 180. The first reports suggested a dash in force straight from Sinai to the Hejaz across the narrow strips of Palestine and Transjordan territory which converge to the head of the Gulf of Aqaba. It is not so certain from later accounts that the operation was so simple, but it is still too soon to decide at what point the invaders actually concentrated; to what extent the numbers of any who may have come from Sinai were swollen by accretions from Palestine or Transjordan; how far the Amir was cognisant of or sympathetic towards the enterprise; or what supplies the raiders derived from Transjordan sources in the early stages. These questions have been, and are likely to be, disputed. The one clear fact is that since the morning of the 21st May a rebel force which has grown considerably, although not to really formidable dimensions, has been in being in the neighbourhood of the coast some distance inside Hejazi territory. 181. Ibn Saud appears to have had no news of the incursion until Mr. Hope Gill, having got instructions, informed him of it on the morning of the 30th May. It would be impossible to do justice in this report to the flood of correspondence which ensued from the 30th May to the 30th June. The main facts which emerge from it may be summed up as follows :— (a) The Hejazi Government took immediate military measures of two kinds. They ordered out the Akhwan from the village settlements in the nearer parts of Nejd to the estimated number of perhaps 5,000 or 6,000, sent important reinforce ments by car to strengthen their garrisons in the north, and they despatched other soldiers and supplies in the barge, fitted with auxiliary motor and one small gun, which they recently purchased in Bahrein. This dhow seems to have gone on a reef near Umlej with the result that the soldiers, &amp;c., had to be transported in smaller dhows to Wejh. It was apparently thought impossible to bring the ordinary troops into action owing to the inaccessibility to motor transport of Ibn Rifada’s force, the demolition of which was left for the Akhwan. These were to concentrate at Al-Ula and to get to grips with the rebels by a movement so planned as to cut off their retreat into Transjordan. They were expected to reach Al-Ula about the beginning of July, but up to the 30th June there was no certain news of them. (5) On the diplomatic side the Hejazi Government made strong representa tions to His Majesty’s Government, taking “ Told you so” as their text. They suspected, not apparently without some reason, the existence of a widespread Hashimite plot with ramifications extending from Egypt to Iraq; were violently suspicious of the Amir Abdullah, and were much perturbed when King Ali, whom they also suspected (though they made no accusation against King Feisal or the Iraqi Government) left Bagdad for Amman by air on the 23rd June. During the first half of June they addressed numerous demands to His Majesty’s Government. Some of them had been anticipated by the latter and by the High Commissioner for Transjordan; some, like the Hejazi requests for a complete closing of the frontier and a promise to surrender any rebels crossing it, could not be complied with; some, like their insistence on an investigation of responsi bilities, to be conducted jointly by the two Governments, were at the very least premature; and the request, restated in practically every note, that His Majesty’s Government should bring about a new settlement between Hejaz-Nejd and Transjordan similar to that arrived at last year 'with Iraq related to a question which His Majesty’s Government had already undertaken in discussion with the Hejazi mission in London to consider seriously, but which they regarded as independent of the immediate problem created by Ibn Rifada. From the very outset the authorities in Transjordan took vigorous measures to prevent the rebelsmmm 8 from getting assistance from that country both by prohibition and by reinforcing the frontier police. Steps were taken to prevent the Beni Atiya from joining the rebellion, and guarantees were taken from the sheikhs of other tribes in Southern Transjordan. The considered attitude of His Majesty’s Government towards the Hejazi representations was defined in a note sent by the Legation to the Acting Hejazi Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 11th June. His Majesty’s Govern ment regretted that Ibn Rifada and his party had succeeded in slipping from Sinai into the Hejaz in a very few hours before the authorities in Palestine and Transjordan were aware of the movement. They explained that it was physically impossible to close the frontier, and that it was for the Hejazi Government, whose forces must not, however, enter Transjordan, to bar the exit of rebels. They nevertheless would take all steps to assist the Hejazi authorities, and they promised that fugitive rebels entering Transjordan would, as far as possible, be disarmed and removed to safe places. The note described in general terms the measures already taken in Transjordan. His Majesty’s Government refused to guarantee the surrender of fugitive rebels, but promised that everything possible would be done to prevent such persons from causing fresh trouble. The question of a treaty settlement between Hejaz-Nejd and Transjordan was dealt with on the lines indicated above. The first reaction of the Hejazi Government to this note was highly critical. In a reply of the 15th June they complained that the action of the British authorities was inadequate and stressed the question of responsibilities. Some days later they changed their tactics. In a series of conversations from the 21st to 23rd June the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs did not revert to his note. He tacitly accepted the position that His Majesty’s Government were doing all they could, and confined himself to discussing practical questions of co-operation between the British and Hejazi Governments, always on the underlying assumption that the Amir Abdullah was the common enemy. It was unnecessary to continue the discussion of the wider aspects of the affair up to the end of June. (c) In those circumstances it became increasingly, as the month wore on, a matter of co-ordinating the measures of the authorities in Transjordan and of the Hejazi Government. A certain amount of information, not very plentiful on either side, was exchanged. Arrangements were made in principle for wireless communication between Hejazi and Transjordan posts, but it had not been effectively established up to the 30th June. H.M.S. “Penzance” was sent to Aqaba, and arrived there on the 14th June. H.M.S. “Hastings” also left Port Sudan for the north of the Red Sea on the 27th June. The despatch of Penzance ’ ’ was decided on for general reasons, but anticipated a request by the Hejazi Government on the 18th June that measures should be taken to guard against assistance reaching the rebels by sea, meaning, it was explained later, any maritime movement of craft, loaded or unloaded, which might bring supplies or facilitate any movement, whether of attack or flight. (d) Early in June the Hejazi Government manifested extreme displeasure against Egypt, and the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs spoke of a rupture with that country. This mood passed, partly perhaps because of the dissuasive language of Sir A. Ryan. As a matter of fact, the Egyptian Government, while denying, both privately and publicly, that Ibn Rifada’s expedition could have been fitted out in Egypt, has shown every readiness, at the instance of His Majesty’s Government, to apply and co-operate in measures to prevent assistance from reaching the rebels from Egypt either by land or sea. 182. The foregoing summary ignores may details, but gives an adequate account of the Ibn Rifada affair and its sequel. It is noteworthy that the Hejazi Government, while preparing a formidable demonstration of force, have shown no great celerity in mobilising it. They have probably banked on the fact that Ibn Rifada has presented no appearance of having provoked any widespread rebellion and has remained confined to the littoral area. It is possible that Ibn Saud’s object in making preparations so formidable in relation to the apparently small proportions of the menace is partly to overawe his own tribes generally and to impress on the Amir Abdullah and others the futility of attempts to upset his regime in the Hejaz. 183. It has been most difficult meanwhile to gauge the position of Ibn Rifada himself. His base appears to be Haikl, a place close to the sea, some 30 miles south of Aqaba. His total force had grown by the latter part of June toy anything from perhaps 800 to 1,800 men, not in all probability very fully armed or mounted, and a portion of it may have been strung along the region to the south of Haikl. There is no evidence of his having reached any important place like Muweyla or Dhaba, the occupation of which might improve his chances; much less Wejh, his original habitat, for it is there that his family, an important one in the Billi tribe, have their town quarters in the Hejaz. 184. A new and disconcerting element was introduced into the situation when, on the night of the 26th June, a party of seventy Beni Atiya crossed the frontier into the Hejaz to the east of Mudawwara, despite the attempts of a small Transjordan police patrol to hold them up. They were supposed to be heading for Tebuk, a place the loyalty of whose garrison has long been considered doubtful owing to the failure of the Hejazi Government to pay its members. Nothing further had been heard of these raiders up to the 30th June. The Hejazi Government, faithful to the altered policy described in paragraph 181 above, received the news fairly philosophically. They did not fail, however, to point the morals of the incident from their point of view, renewing their accusations against the Amir Abdullah and their demand for an early treaty settlement and hinting at the danger of retaliation by incensed Nejdis. The Transjordan authorities promptly incarcerated at Kerak three leading sheikhs in order to discourage any further parties of Beni Atiya from invading the Hejaz. McvcDonnell Investigation. 185. As stated elsewhere, Mr. Hope Gill pressed in May for the settlement of the Hejazi Government’s contribution to the cost of this enquiry. Sir A. Ryan reverted to the subject in June, but the moment was not propitious for energetic action, and the claim remained unsettled. Customs Relations 186. Final form had been given in March to the reply to be given to the Hejazi Government, if they should revert (but not otherwise) to this long-standing question, which has been in abeyance for practical purposes since 1930. In the absence of any fresh representations from the Hejazi side, the reply continued to be held up throughout May and June ; nor did the Legation inform the Hejazi Government of a decision of'the Transjordan Government, reported by the High Commissioner in May, to authorise, subject to certain conditions, the passage through Transjordan between Syria and Hejaz-Nejd of goods, other than arms and ammunition, the importation of which into Transjordan itself is prohibited. Iraq. 187. Some trouble arose in February owing to the arrival of a Nejdi force of twenty-five men and two armed cars at a well called Judaidat-al-Arar on the Iraq-Nejd frontier, and a claim made by the commanding officer to levy taxes on tribes in the vicinity. The force withdrew on the arrival of two Iraqi desert police cars, but the Nejdis reappeared in March, and the claim to tax any tribesmen entering Nejd territory, to which apparently the Hejaz-Nejd Govern ment consider Judaidat-al-Arar to belong, was reasserted in a letter from the Governor of Skaka to the Sheikh of the Iraqi Aneyza. Although the Iraqi Government have stated in at least one communication that Judaidat is considered to be an Iraqi well, they do not seem to be very sure of their ground for a territorial claim, and to rely more on an article in the Uqair protocols prohibiting any military use by either side of watering places near the frontier. The Legation in Jedda' is unaware of the position on the spot during May and June, but, from language held by the Iraqi Charge d’Affaires to Sir A. Ryan on the 6th and 9th June, it appeared that the dispute was still in being. Dr. Naji spoke of the possibility of regarding the well as lying actually on the frontier and being bisected by it. 188. The Ibn Rifada affair gave rise to rumours of more widespread trouble involving the frontier with Iraq, and they were perhaps stimulated by the news of the sudden resurn of Sir F. Humphrys to Bagdad, due, in fact, to quite other reasons, about that time. The Legation has no knowledge of any real malaise on that frontier, apart from the Judaidat affair. The best of the bazaar yarns was that King Feisal’s son had gone against his father and engaged in some [542 c—3] c10 anti-Saudian enterprise down south, and that King Feisal had addressed a letter of explanation and apology to Ibn Sand. Koweit and Bahrein. 189. Further progress was made in May and June in the following up of the various matters discussed by the Political Resident during his visit to Ibn Saud at Hofuf in January. The question of the best approach to a more official discussion of the Koweit blockade still presented difficulty, and final instructions had not reached the Legation up to the end of June. The question of emergency landing-grounds on the Hasa coast passed into a new phase in the circumstances described in paragraph 217 below. The position regarding postal communication between Hasa and the outer world is described in paragraph 172. The Hejazi Government have not attempted to reopen the question of the status of their agents at Koweit and Bahrein since receiving the Political Resident's explanation of the difficulties in the way of recognising them officially. News was received at Jedda in May of the local settlement of the question arising out of a fresh intrusion of Ibn Saud’s people into Koweit territory in March, an apology for which was tendered by the King’s chief frontier officer and accepted by the sheikh. In June His Majesty’s Minister conveyed to the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs a request from Sir H. V. Biscoe that the arrangement made at Hofuf to enable Hindu traders, known as Bunniahs, to visit Qatif for periods not exceeding two months, should be extended to Jubail, with permission to prolong the stay in either case to three months. Ibn Saud agreed to the prolongation of time, but refused access to Jubail. 190. Sir A. Ryan expressed to Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, on the 5th June, the gratification with wffiich His Majesty’s Government had received the message sent by Ibn Saud through the Political Resident (see January—March report, paragraph 44). This message had not been acknowledged at the time of receipt, for reasons partly connected with the difficult situation between the Governments in February and March. 191. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin protested orally on the 23rd June against alleged action by the Bahrein authorities in requiring, it was said, a cargo of rice for the Hejazi Government to be landed instead of allowing it to be unloaded direct into dhows sent from the mainland. This ^vas apparently the first case arising under the arrangements described in the January-March report, paragraph 49, which arrangements, according to explanations furnished in a report from the Political A^ent, w T ere more the concern of the shipowners concerned than the subject of an agreement entered into by him, although he had stated to the British Indian Steam Navigation Company the point of view of the Bahrein Government and other interests adversely affected by overside delivery. In the particular case about wffiich Sheikh Yusuf Yasin protested, it was possible to reply that the rice had been shipped in the ordinary way of transit, and that no notice had been given by the steamship company that it was for overside delivery; to refute an allegation that it had been landed at the instance of the Bahrein authorities after having been actually first unloaded into dhows from the mainland; and to add that the Bahrein Government had remitted the duty as an exceptional measure. The incident, nevertheless, seems to necessitate a further examination of the somewhat difficult questions of principle involved. 192. Previously to this affair, Fuad Bey Hamza had, on the 11th May, spoken to Mr. Rendel at the Foreign Office about the more general question of transit dues at Bahrein, and had spoken of the Hejazi Government’s project of creating a port of their own at Ras Tanura as being a consequence of the refusal of the Bahrein authorities to waive duty in the case of goods for Ibn Saud and his Government. Fuad Bey w r as told that the matter would be examined. A sir and Yemen. 193. No development in the relations between Hejaz-Nejd and the Yemen were reported in May and June; nor anything of importance regarding the internal situation in Asir, which seemed to be well held. It was stated in June that the King was undertaking considerable reorganisation of the Asir administration, and was sending thither some eighty officials, mostly Hejazi, with a view- to making the country productive from a revenue point of view. It is confirmed that a new r Amir, a Nejdi, was recently appointed.Chapter III .—Foreign Relations. General's Hejazi Mission. 194. The mission arrived in Paris about the beginning of May, after a short stay in Geneva. They came on from Paris to London on the 7th May and stayed until the 16th May. They subsequently visited The Hague (the 16th to the 19th May), Berlin (the 20th to the 24th May), Warsaw (the 25th to the 28th May), Moscow (the 29th May to the 5th June), Constantinople (the 9th to the 12th June), and Angora (the 13th to the 19th June, or earlier). They were expected to reach Tehran via Constantinople and Baku on the 28th June. The dates given are approximate. Various references are made elsewhere to the business done. On the ceremonial side, the mission seem to have been received with much honour in all the capitals from which information has been received, but to have attracted comparatively little public attention. They lunched with President Doumer just before his assassination, and Fuad Bey flew from London to Paris to attend the funeral. They were given military honours at Dover, and met at Victoria by representatives of the King and Sir John Simon. In London they stayed as the guests of His Majesty’s Government at the Dorchester; visited Windsor privately on the 8th May; were received by His Majesty the King at Buckingham Palace on the 9th May, and visited the Morris Works in pouring rain that afternoon; attended a reception by the Hejazi Minister on the 10th May, and dined that evening with His Majesty’s Government at the Foreign Office, Sir John Simon presiding; were shown the Port of London, including the wine vaults full of alcoholic fumes, on the 11th May; and saw a display at Aldershot on the 12th May. The Amir attended their Majesty’s Court on the 11th May, and Fuad Bey the second Court on the 12th May. The Amir showed intelligent interest in what he saw, acquitted himself well at all functions, and appeared to enjoy his visit, in spite of a heavy cold, contracted in France, happily. Fuad Bey attended as few functions as possible, saw to the business side, which the Amir left entirely to him, and visited the House of Commons. The Amir was made a G.B.E., Fuad Bey a K.B.E. The official visit ended on the 14th May, and the mission fended for themselves during the Whitsun week-end. The farewell messages were most cordial, and included a happily-drafted message to the “charming people’’ of Great Britain, as well as the more conventional expressions of thanks to the King, &amp;c. At The Hague the mission was received by the Queen, and visited the Netherlands East Indies Exhibition. A day was spent in Amsterdam. Little information is available regarding the subsequent visits, except that on the Russian frontier the mission was hailed not only by officials but by brass bands, which “ played the International and various Arabian airs,” and were in Moscow entertained in the manner provided for State guests of the second category of importance. They also visited Leningrad. International Conferences, &amp;c. 195. There is nothing important to record. Great Britain. 196. The Hejazi Mission (i.e., for practical purposes Fuad Bey Hamza, as the Amir Feisal attended only the first business meeting, which was little more than formal) raised the following questions, which were discussed at official meetings on the 9th and 13th May :— (1) General Relations .—The mission expressed Ibn Saud’s misgivings as to whether His Majesty’s Government loved hinj as wholeheartedly as of old. and his anxiety to be guided in his policy by the views of His Majesty’s Government, to whom he looked for both moral and material support. Sir L. Oliphant made cordial and reassuring statements in general terms on behalf of His Majesty’s Government. (2) Possibility of a Loan and Economic Developments. —As regards the former, see paragraph 165. As regards the latter, Fuad Bey mentioned Mr. Twitched’s surveys and the King’s desire to look to Great Britain in all things. Nothing conclusive emerged. [542 c—3] c 212 (3) Haramain Wakfs. —Fuad Bey raised this question generally and with reference to a particular Wakf created by a deceased Indian, who had died in Java, leaving property in Rangoon; Wakfs in Palestine; and possible Wakfs in Hyderabad. In his general remarks he intimated that the Hejazi Government might want to send a delegation to India to make enquiries, and was given a sympathetic hearing. His Majesty's Government made active enquiries in due course about the first of the two specific matters mentioned, the results of which were communicated to the Legation in Jedda in June for the information of the Hejazi Government. (4) The Transjordan Frontier. —The mission pressed more particularly the question of a general settlement between Hejaz-Nejd and Transjordan similar to that between the former and Iraq. They received an undertaking that the matter, though one of difficulty, would be studied energetically. It has since come still more to the forefront of Hejazi desiderata in the circumstances recorded in paragraph 181. (5) Soviet Activities and Relations between Hejaz-Nejd and U.S.S.R .— Fuad Bey threw his first statement on this subject into a request by Ibn Saud for advice. He was told that His Majesty’s Government conceived the views and tenets of the Soviet Government to be very different from those of I£n Saud, but that if the latter saw reason to alter the policy of coldness which, according to Fuad Bey, he had hitherto pursued towards the U.S.S.R., His Majesty’s Government could not feel aggrieved. Fuad Bey explained that the refusal of a loan by His Majesty's Government might compel the Hejazi Govern- to “ look elsewhere,” but his last word was that: “ As regards the Soviet, he thought it unlikely that there would be any important change in the attitude of his Government.” (6) Fuad Bey mentioned the question of the possible loan of a Royal Air Force mission to Hejaz-Nejd, a matter which he had discussed informally with Mr. Rendel, and which, so far, was merely the subject of a personal suggestion of his own. He was promised that it would be examined (see paragraph 215). [Paragraphs 197 and 198 omitted.] 199. Various minor questions were discussed less formally in the interval between the above meetings. Besides the matter just mentioned, they included the question of landing grounds in Hasa (see paragraph 217) and transit dues at Bahrein (see paragraph 191). 200. Sir A. Ryan left London a few days after the mission’s departure, and reached Jedda in H.M.S ; “ Hastings ” on the 30th May. He was received with at least as much distinction as when he first arrived in Jedda, and there was an evident desire on the part of the King and the Hejazi Government to show that the clouds which had compelled his prolonged absence had really rolled by. From then until the 30th June the Ibn Rifada affair and its aftermath occupied the attention of the two Governments and the Legation, to the almost complete exclusion of everything except routine business. Despite the critical attitude of the Hejazi Government during the first half of the period, the diplomatic atmosphere was excellent throughout the whole of it. France. 201 . Little is known of any business done by the Hejazi Mission in Paris, except that the French Government appear to have been pretty firm about the necessity for protective sanitary measures on the part of other Powers to minimise the danger of epidemics originating in the pilgrimage. 202. After various hitches over matters of language and verbal forms, ratifica tions were exchanged in Jedda on the 24th June of the treaty between France and Hejaz-Nejd and the Syrian customs agreement (November-December report, paragraph 47). Italy. 203. The Italian Government have appointed as Minister to Hejaz-Nejd Commendatore Ottavio de Poppo, who is understood to have been some timeconsul at Port Said and to have been recently in their Embassy at Madrid. Nothing is known as to the date of his arrival, but he has made enquiries about housing, servants, &amp;c., which reveal a pathetic ignorance as to what he is in for. 204. The reply of the Italian Ministry for Foreign Affairs to informal enquiries by His Majesty’s Embassy in Rome as to the latest Italian attitude in regard to Asir seems to show that, while the Italian Government do not consider themselves committed, by their recognition of Ibn Baud and the conclusion of a treaty, to any acceptance of Hejazi claims (a point of view which they had explained to the Amir Eeisal in Rome), the Italians are content to let the question lie dormant in the hope that it will settle itself. Germany. 205. A painful impression was created-'in Jedda at the beginning of May by the news that a German subject, named Krakowsky, had been set upon and beaten most severely by Ibn Baud’s soldiery on the 30th April. This man had long lived in a hand-to-mouth way in Jedda. Having some flying experience, he had been engaged in the temporary organisation improvised to run the air force after the disintegration of the British personnel. He became involved in the labyrinth of intrigue connected with the air force and in the end terminated his connexion with it by crashing in the Jedda lagoon with a Wapiti which he had been dragged from a sickbed to fly to Asir. He was owed money by the Government and became a man with grievances, almost crazed probably by that and ill-health. It was alleged that on the 30th April he was found near the aerodrome with incendiary material. He had certainly been indiscreet in his language and in frequenting the neighbourhood of the palace, where he is said to have been guilty either of discourtesy or suspicious conduct in the King’s presence. There is reason to believe that the onslaught was due less to immediate causes than to revenge for the damage done to the Wapiti last year. Anyhow the beating was a monstrous affair and it is difficult to acquit Ibn Baud of personal responsibility, as he had arrived in Jedda that morning. The German consul felt unable to take a strong line in all the circumstances, but he was able to arrange for Krakowsky’s removal as a prisoner from the barracks into which he was thrown, to hospital and for his embarkation shortly after. Payment of the money due to him was refused, but the King eventually ordered that it should be given as a present to the consul to do what he liked with. 206. M. de Haas himself left Jedda in June, leaving the German consulate derelict. Soviet Russia. 207. Reference is made elsewhere to the possibility of a new orientation of Ibn Baud’s policy towards the U.S.S.R. under pressure of economic and financial necessity. The Russian Minister in Jedda has been very little in evidence. Egypt. 208. Reference is made in paragraph 181 to the first reaction of the Hejazi Government to the Ibn Rifada affair, as regards Egypt. The Egyptian consul, Hafiz Bey Amer, is one of the people whom they suspect of complicity. There is no evidence that the suspicion is justified, although Hafiz Bey is certainly hostile to the present regime in the Elejaz and professes a personal wish that the country might be run otherwise in international Moslem interests. He returned to Jedda after a very prolonged absence in June, soapier in his ways than ever. His return was preceded by the usual rumour that he was bringing new instruc tions with a view to the settlement of outstanding questions. Iraq. 209. The dispute regarding the seat of the Iraqi Legation in the Hejaz remained unsettled throughout May and June. Dr. Naji Asil continued to reside in Jedda and was unable to present his letters, but was nevertheless received in Mecca on the 10th May for the exchange of the ratifications (which duly took place on that day) of the treaties concluded last year. The Acting Hejazi Minister for Foreign Affairs accused him in confidential conversation with Sir A.Ryan on the 4th June of complicity in.the machinations of King Ali and others whom they believe to be at the back of the Ibn Rifada affair. He visited Medina for a few days at the beginning of June and was, according to his own account, very closely watched. He returned to Jedda on the 8th June and went to Taif to see Ibn Saud next day, before leaving rather unexpectedly for Bagdad on the 11th June. His object apparently was to get the King’s last word about the Legation dispute. It was uncompromising, as might have been expected from a reply which His Majesty had sent on the 28th April to a personal appeal from King leisal. Both sides had so dug themselves into their positions that up to the end of June it seemed difficult for either to give way, unless the Amir Feisal’s visit to Bagdad, where he was to arrive on the 8th July, should prove to have pro\ ided a solvent. 1 he outlook for normal and friendly relations was none too bright at the end of June, what with the acerbity of this difference, the suspicious ness of the Hejazi Government towards Dr. Naji, the dispute over Judaidat-al- Arar (see paragraph 187), and the fact that the Hejazi Charge d’Affaires elect at Bagdad was still in residence at Mecca. 210 . The Iraqi Government are still anxious for an agreement over the less contentious but long-drawn-out question of the organisations of an overland motor route for pilgrims from Iraq. Afghanistan. 211 The Afghan Mission (see March report, paragraph 68), concluded a treaty with Hejaz-Nejd on the 5th May, after Ahmad Shah Khan had presented credentials to Ibn Saud on the 3rd May. The treaty had not been published up to the 30th June. It is noteworthy that both the reception and the signing of the treaty took place in Jedda. It was categorically stated in the account of the former in the Umm-al-Qura that the presentation of letters had been delayed until the King could come to Jedda, because 4 in Mecca, on account of religious and traditional reasons, no diplomatic ceremonies can be held.” The Hejazi Government were doubtless anxious to strengthen their case in the quarrel over the seat of the Iraqi Legation. It is unfortunate that the differences of Moslems should cause diplomacy to be regarded as an occupation too profane to be pursued in a Holy Place. The Afghan Mission left Jedda via India on the 14th May. 212 . It is worth noting that the Indian agitator Ismail Ghuznavi, a protege of Ibn Saud with pretensions to be his representative in India, took it on himself to broadcast the news of the conclusion of the treaty to a large number of papers, &amp;c., mostly Indian, but including also the “ Corriere ” of Milan and the United Press of Berlin, to whom he represented it as an event to which far- reaching political importance was attached. 213. The Afghan Mission, while in Mecca, arranged to buy an existing house, belonging to the Governor of Jedda, to serve as the projected hostel for pilgrims. Other Countries. importance to record except that the representa tives of the Netherlands, Turkey and Persia left Jedda in May and had not returned up to the end of June. Adequate arrangements for the carrying on of routine business by juniors of no great individual interest were made in each case. Hejazi Air Force. Chapter IV .—Air Matters. 2! 5 The equipment in Jedda remained useless and more or less derelict during May and June. When the Hejazi Mission were in London, Fuad Bev suggested at an informal discussion that His Majesty's Government should reconsider their attitude of last autumn and reverted to his personal suggestion that they might offer a Royal Air Force mission on a moderate scale which he indicated. It was suggested to him that he might mention the matter at an official meeting and he did so on the 13th May. In due course the Foreign Office who were now inclined to favour the proposal, entered into correspondence on the subject with the Air Ministry.216. In June, the Legation was approached by Misr Airwork, an Egyptian company associated with Airwork (Limited), of Heston Airport in England, for advice as to the utility of offering to demonstrate to Ibn Sand an Avro machine suitable lor instructional and light military purposes, which they had been showing in Persia and Iraq. They thought, having in mind, inter alia, the prospect of military operations in the Hejaz, that the King would find this type of aircraft handier and cheaper than Wapitis. Sir A. Ryan prepared a guarded reply, arranged that it should not be delivered in Egypt before His Majesty’s Government had approved of it. Emergency Landing Grounds. 217. Following on the discussion of this during the Political Resident's visit to Hofuf in January, Mr. Hope Gill was instructed on the 3rd May to seek Ibn Saud s definite assent to the selection aud marking of emergency landing grounds at Darin and Jinnah by or in consultation with Royal Air Force, Iraq, and to a Royal Air horce reconnaissance of Makta with a view to similar arrangements there, if it should prove suitable. He was to be guided by earlier instructions as to the (juestion of rent and cost of preparation. The King’s precipitate departure from Jedda prevented Mr. Hope Gill from taking the question up with His Majesty in person. He had what appeared to be promising conversations with Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, but it soon appeared that the Hejazi Government preferred that the matter should be dealt with by their mission in London, who were not, however, to take the initiative in raising it. It was accordingly discussed informally, but closely, between Fuad Bey and Mr. Rendel, of the Foreign Office, on the 11th May, and by the same, with the assistance of Captain Peirse, of the Air Ministry, on the 13th May. The position reached was that it remained for the Air Ministry to prepare, in the light of those discussions, a fresh statement for communication to the Hejazi Government as regards both the desiderata of Flis Majesty’s Government and the quid pro quo which they would be prepared to offer. Alleged Aerial Trespass in Hejaz-Nejd Territory. 218. No fresh complaints were received in May or June. Certain earlier complaints regarding violations of territory alleged to have.occurred in February and March were reported by the authorities concerned and a suitable communi cation was addressed to the Hejazi Government on the 25th May. Chapter V.— Military Matters. 219. There is nothing of importance to record apart from what is stated elsewhere, especially in the section dealing with the Transjordan frontier. Chapter VI.— Naval Matters. 220 . The only naval visit, British or foreign, to Jedda was that of H.M.S. “ Hastings,” which arrived with His Majesty's Minister on board on the 30th May and stayed to the 2nd June. By the end of June both Red Sea sloops were in the north of the Red Sea in connexion with the Ibn Rifada affair. Chapter VII.— Pilgrimage. 221. The dispersal of the pilgrims proceeded normally in May and June. The sanitary condition of returning pilgrims was satisfactory and the Alexandria Quarantine Board formally declared the pilgrimage clean on the 3rd May. It was reported from India in June that twenty cases of small-pox were discovered in one pilgrim ship on its return to Bombay. Telegrams were exchanged between the Government of India and the Legation about this mysterious affair, but it had not been fully elucidated up to the end of the month. The problem of the repa triation of destitute pilgrims has again been somewhat formidable this year. No further details under this heading need be given in this already lengthy report, as it is hoped to distribute earlier than usual the full report on the 1932 pilgrimage.16 Chapter VIII.— Slavery. 222. Five male and three female slaves took refuge in the Legation in May and June. They were disposed of as follows :— Manumitted and repatriated : 3 males. Locally manumitted : 1 male and 1 female. Left the Legation voluntarily before being dealt with : 1 male. On hand at end of June : 2 females. 223. The cases of two women of presumed Abyssinian origin were referred by telegraph to His Majesty’s Minister in Addis Ababa, in pursuance of the arrangements recommended last year (November-December report, paragraph 78), with a request that he should ascertain whether the Ethiopian Government would make itself responsible for them. The matter was still pending at the end of June and seemed unlikely to go smoothly owing to the difficulty of supplying adequate particulars, a difficulty likely to arise in the case of all slaves captured in early childhood and brought up in Arabia. 224. The Hejazi Mission in London made no attempt to reopen the question of Royal slaves nor was it adverted to in Jedda. The mission took with them as servant an ex-slave, possibly though not certainly manumitted ad hoc. He proved an intelligent observer of things seen on the tour. Chapter IX.— Miscellaneous. Legation Staff. 225. His Majesty’s Minister returned to Jedda on the 30th May, as already stated. Probationer Vice-Consul Gamble arrived on the 6th May to take up the post of an acting vice-consul, attached to the Legation, for the sole purpose of studying Arabic, subject to a proviso that he might be employed for a strictly limited time daily on other work in order to learn the routine. Mr. Hope Gill and Mr. Furlonge both proceeded on leave on the 3rd June, a coincidence resulting from Mr. Hope Gill's long detention during Sir A. Ryan’s absence. 226. The Malay pilgrimage officer returned to Malaya on the 14th May. There were some changes in the subordinate personnel of the*me'^cal section. Deportation. 227. Certain questions of principle connected with deportation were discussed in a Foreign Office despatch to Jedda of the 4th May. In view of the arbitrary attitude sometimes taken up by the Hejazi authorities in connexion with the deportation of British subjects, the Legation was authorised, if it should think it desirable, to endeavour to obtain some reciprocal agreement with the Hejazi Government for a more rigid application of the usual international procedure, but the Foreign Office expressed the view, which Sir A. Ryan shared, that it would be better, instead of inviting a general discussion of principles, to try to get that Government to apply such practice in individual cases. 228. In one case the Sudan Government sent to Jedda a person, believed to be a Hejazi, who had entered the Sudan irregularly, without awaiting the formal assent of the Hejazi Government. The latter asked rather insistently that he should be sent back to the Sudan, but it was possible to put the matter to them in such a way that they did not return to the charge up to the 30th June. The man was at least half-crazy and had assumed many names (including that of President Hindenburg) at various times, so that his actual origin was hard to determine. oC’s. P.

The King remained at Taif, except for short outings in the neighbour hood, from the 1st July to the 29th August, when he left for Jedda in order, it was explained, to take leave of the foreign representatives before proceeding to Riyadh. In the ordinary course he would have gone to Nejd much earlier, but he was prevented from doing so by the Ibn Rifada affair and the general situation which it precipitated. On the 30th August he received the foreign representatives in successive formal audiences in the forenoon. Later in the day he again received His Majesty's Minister, who presented Commander Farquhar of H.M.S. “ Penzance ” and then discussed the general situation with His Majesty, but on* [571 dd—2] 6562 enclosure No. 2 IN Wl £KiY 'EH 12 JAN/1933 FROM 8E0RETARY, POll SECRET DEPT.

The King appeared to be in much better health than when Mr. Hope Gill saw him at the beginning of May. Ministry for Foreign A ffairs. 230. Sheikh Yussuf Yasin continued to act as Minister until the 3rd August, when he and Fuad Bey Hamza, who had arrived at Taif from Koweit via Riyadh on the 24th July, announced that the one had handed over and the other taken on the business of foreign affairs. When the Amir Feisal, who had stayed behind at Riyadh, got back on the 7th August, no further move was made. The position appears to be that the Amir has slid back into his post as Minister for Foreign Affairs, but that Fuad Bey is more than ever the practical head of the Ministry. Up to the end of the month Fuad Bey continued to sign notes, sometimes saying “ f am directed ' without saying by whom. There is doubtless some game behind this but its nature is obscure. It may be merely the game of Fuad, who affects in any case the title of “ Deputy Minister,' or there may be some truth in the suggestion made in some quarters that the Amir is dissatisfied with the confidence reposed by the King in Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman and is unwilling to tolerate that gentleman's retention. If so, the Prince has had no uncertain answer from his father, as will be seen below. Finance. 231. There have been no public developments in the financial situation. It is a curious thing that one has heard of late much less talk than one used to of the depletion of the Treasury or of poverty among the public generally, and none at all of financial stringency interfering with measures to suppress the Ibn Rifada revolt, to subsidise the Akhwan, &amp;c. The Government as such is doubtless as poor as ever. Unpaid officials, merchants, &amp;c., are probably too sunken in depression to make much noise. The apparent abundance of money for military and quasi-military purposes lends support to the idea that the King has long been saving up for a rainy day. 232. The Dutch financial adviser, M. van Leeuwen, left for three months on the 29th July, for reasons of health. These were genuine and he showed no signs of not intending to return; nor any sign whatsoever of intending to stay on in the Hejaz once his contract expires next year. Little is known as to what he has done or been allowed to attempt. 233. On the 22nd August it was announced that, by Iradei Sonie (the old Turkish expression for an Imperial decree, seldom heard under the Saudian regime, though apparently not unprecedented), the Wakalat of Finance had been raised to the status of a Wazarat or full Ministry, with Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman as Minister and his brother Hamad as Wakfl, i.e., Under-Secretary, unless Fuad Bey Hamza’s version, “ Deputy Minister,” be preferred. Previously there had been only two Ministers called Wazarat, or possibly three including that of Military Affairs, but all were combined with the presidency of the council in the person of the Amir Feisal. Economic Affairs. 234. Nothing further has been heard at the Legation of the large economic schemes mentioned in the last report. The dullness was relieved, however, by one bright gleam from New York. A resident in that city, Mr. L. Lincoln Glick, sent to His Majesty's Legation a typed advance copy of a projected paper called the “ Congress Advocate,” which promises to be a powerful 100 per cent. Islamic American organ, and which has already received not only the moral support of the Egyptian consulate in New York, but also 20 dollars in cash from a leading Moslem in the United States. Mr. Glick has the progressive outlook of the 20th century, which he identified with the 16th of the Mahometan era. This latter fact doubtless makes it all the easier for him to conceive Jedda as being the City of Destiny, perhaps the largest in the world, a vast urban area stretching from its present site to Rabigh, 100 miles away, served by a loop line of the Hejaz Railway, watered from aqueducts in the mountains, the scene of an annual Islamic Congress, the goal of throngs of visitors for whom there will be cheap travel facilities and mammoth hotels. Nor does Mr. Glick stop there. He contemplates an enlarged Haram area, which will apparently extend to the new Jedda, withits clearing house for the pilgrims of all nations. Mr. Glick seems to think that Islam needs pep. W ireless. 235. It was announced on the 15th July that the new wireless stations had been completed at Mecca (6 kilowatt), Qatif, Jubail, Hasa (Hufuf), and Oqair, and that they were available for ordinary telegraphic correspondence. The wireless station at Qaf was completed late in August. The charges for internal wireless telegrams was reduced about the same time from 3 piastres miri to 2 piastres miri per word. Land-line telegrams between Jedda, Mecca and Taif cost ^ piastre miri per word. Legislation. 236. A new law on passports was published on the 1st July. It does nothing to mitigate the hardship imposed on departing travellers, other than single season pilgrims, by the rule that a guarantor must be found in case there should be any claims on the person leaving the country. A law on coastal fisheries, &amp;c., is in course of publication by instalments. Regulations governing postal packets were published on the 22nd July. Census. 237. This measure, the announcement concerning which was mentioned in the report for May and June (paragraph 174), was completed during the month of July. Two questions arose in connexion with it, viz. :— (a) Whether it could be claimed that forms to be filled up by the Legation staff should be officially furnished to the Legation by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, and (5) Whether, in the possible event of the measure being a prelude to the eviction from the Hejaz of certain categories of foreigners, His Majesty’s Government could claim right of residence for British subjects and British-protected persons. His Majesty's Minister telegraphed to the Foreign Office on the 5th July requesting a ruling on these two points. On the 13th July, before the Foreign Office’s reply had been received, the town crier announced to the inhabitants of Jedda that anyone who failed to return his census form by the 16th July would be imprisoned. Sir Andrew Ryan thereupon wrote a personal letter to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs enquiring whether it was intended that the staff of the Legation were to be included in the measure, and stating that, if so, he would be willing to see that the staff completed the forms, provided that the latter were officially sent to him for distribution 238. On the 16th July a reply was received from the Foreign Office confirming the Minister’s presumption at (a), and stating that there would be no ground for official protest against the deportation of individual British subjects. It indicated, however, that semi-official representations could be made in certain cases and that objection could be taken to any wholesale expulsion of persons by classes. On the 19th July the Ministry for Foreign Affairs’ reply was received stating that the necessary number of forms would be sent to the Legation. These were duly received, completed and returned. It was thought when the census was announced that it would lead to a rush of applications for passports by British subjects and British-protected persons, and a memorandum was accordingly circulated to the British authorities most closely concerned giving a short resume of the situation, so that they would be in a position to deal expeditiously with any applications for passports that might be referred to them by the Legation. In the event, however, the anticipated rush did not materialise. The result of the census has not yet been published. General Internal Situation. 239. The Ibn Rifada affair, which was dealt with in the last report under the heading “Transjordan,” became in July and August the dominant feature of the internal situation, and can best be dealt with here in conjunction with two connected matters, viz., the Akhwan movement and the repercussions in the Hejaz of the Ad-Dabbagh plot. [571 dd—2 ] b 24 240. The Ibn Rifada adventure itself came to an inglorious end on the 30th July, except for the carnage in detail which followed. There is still much obscurity as to the movements and number of the rebels. It is probable that the whole of Ibn Rifada's forces, including tribal elements who joined him m the Hejaz, never exceeded 1.000 men, inadequately armed and mounted and suffeimg from shortage of food, owing to the measures taken by the authorities in Trans jordan, Palestine and Egypt to prevent supplies from reaching them by land or sea. The rebels had tarried long at or near Haql, but in July they moved south until the bulk of them were at Huraiba and Sherma, places on or close to the sea eastward from the southern end of the Gulf of Aqaba. There was some prospect of their attacking Muweyla or even Dhaba, where Ibn Saud had garrisons, and they were reported at one moment to be threatening the road between the ^Y 0 ', 241. Meanwhile Ibn Saud had been continuing his preparations slowly but methodically. The principal forces intended to be used were the Akhwan levies, which had been summoned to assemble at A1 L la. It is not known how many fathered there. Estimates varied from 1,500 to 10,000, a Hejazi figure and probably much exaggerated. Whatever the number at A1 Ula, it was sufficient to enable an important contingent under Ibn Aqil to be moved to Dhaba, whence the Akhwan, working in with other Government forces, including camelry undei Ibn Sultan, the following of the Amir of Dhaba and a party from Taif under one of the King's own henchmen, marched against the rebels. They located the mam body of the latter, apparently some 400 men, at Jebel Shar, a position inland from the road between Dhaba and Muweyla. The battle, or battue, took place on the 30th July. According to the official reports, 370 rebels were killed on the field, a remnant, including twenty men of the Beni Atiya, escaped, and the losses on the Government side were only nine. Ibn Saud gave orders that m the subsequent round-up all persons who had joined the rebels should be killed. Reports published subsequently recorded the slaughter of various parties of rebels m the area between Muweyla, Haql and Alagan, a place some distance inland from Haq . 242. News from Transjordan in the course of August indicated a possibility of a rally of rebel fragments, Imran tribesmen and Beni Atiya, notably those left over from the party which entered the Hejaz on the night of the 26th June (see paragraph 184), at Alagan. If this rally took place, the rebels would appear to have made no effective stand. Much less is known however, as to what had happened up to the end of August between Alagan and the Hejaz Railway. e position at the end of the month appeared to be that the majority of Ibn Aqil s Akhwan had been sent back to Dhaba, but that there might be a further movement of Government forces from Tebuk to clean up any disaffected area east of Alagan. The Beni Atiya party under Ibn Farhan mentioned above seems to have done some successful raiding and to have recrossed the frontier with looted camels but to have doubled back again into Hejaz-Nejd and to have left some of the loot at Aiaga^isbef^^dmp^smg^iod foUowing the defeat of lbn Rif a da a fair number of stragglers made good their escape into Transjordan. According to a telegram from Transjordan, dated the 31st August, there were, including women, 103 at Aqaba and forty-seven at Maan. . . , , . • 1 244 It has been said that the Akhwan were the principal element m the forces called up to cope with the rebellion. At first mention was made only of a concentration at A1 Ula, to consist of some 5,000 or , f ^ 00 / r ^ 1 t ^ e dfYulv^if of Neid It is not certain how many actually assembled. It looked m July as it there might have been some lack of response to the call to arms. This in its turn suggested the possibility of disaffection among part of thebhammar. According to^o^emmentpublications after the Battle of Jebel Shar and miscel aneous ■sources of information, there was, in fact, no serious manifestation of disloyalty. On the contrary, the Akhwan spirit was roused all over the country to an extent embarrassing to the King. Large numbers of them came at his summons to Taif, fLp of emero-ency elsewhere, more especially m Asn. Sheikh Yussut iasin pur the number ft 10,000, and another official mentioned as many as 15,000 a day or two later The numbers may have been exaggerated, but there wet e cei tainly teas than 4 000 early in August, largely Ateyba, whose presence was a fair y conclusive refutation of previous rumours of disaffection in the region round Taif itself. Fuad Bey spoke to Sir A. Ryan of other assemblages all the way from e5 Koweit border to Taif, a country which he had just traversed on his way back from his travels in Europe, &amp;c. 245 The “ Umm-al-Qura ’ ’ of the 5th August published a very interesting collection of documents bearing on the King’s dispositions and the response ot the Akhwan to the cry of Jihad, which had been widely raised and had been endoi sea by the Ulama of Nejd. The main note in these documents was a general clamour against any limitation of operations to the unworthy object of reducing Ibn Rifada and a demand that all those who turned out m the cause of religion should be given an equal opportunity of service; service, not against a handlul of active rebels, but against the alleged arch-instigator, »•«., the Amir of Transiordan. It was this that embarrassed the King, for all alike appealed to his sense of religious duty as a reason for attacking the real enemy Ibn baud would have dearly liked to gratify such a demand, for his own hatred and misti ust ot the Amir had grown to a passionate resentment by the end of J''y. bu t he l ' [ie ' that any adventure across the frontier would involve him with Great Britain. He had turned on the Akhwan tap to the full. His task in August was to turn it off sufficiently to avert the danger of any irruption into Iransjordan and to piess His Maiesty's Government to liquidate the situation between himself and his neighbour. ' He took steps to send as many Akhwan as he could to their homes on a promise to receive them at Riyadh in October and report progress He hopes to us « the breathing-space to get His Majesty's Government to play up to his ' 246 It must not be supposed that the whole of Nejd, much less the whole of the Hejaz are loyal at heart. Enquiries in connexion with the Ad-Uabbagh plot have revealed the existence of a widespread conspiracy to rum Ibn feaud, a conspiracy which has ramifications in Transjordan, possibly in Iraq, certain!}/ m Egypt; in Asir, the Yemen, Aden, part of the Hadramaut coast and a Massawa; and to some extent in the Hejaz itself, e.g., m towns like Mecca and Jedda where many citizens might be expected, not indeed to rise but to sympathise. There was apparently a plan to engineer more or less simultaneous movements in the Northern Hejaz and in Asir. In the event the Ad-Dabbaghs and their accomplices were very active, but the only coup which came oft was that ^247^ It may be said by way of summary that all the active spirits displayed ineptitude, all the important elements, which without being in the plot, might have joined in any promising movement, sat tight on their fences and Ibn oaud emerged with greatly increased strength and prestige. There would appear to be a minor focus of disaffection at Taima, and there may yet be trouble elsewhere, but he has demonstrated his hold on his dominions as a whole in a very impressive manner. Although merciless in the north, he has shown politic clemency to the persons who were arrested in Jedda and Mecca in June (see paragraph 56). Those who were deported to Riyadh were pardoned late in August. On the other hand a spy, who had apparently been working for the anti-Saudi party in Eg} pt, was executed in Mecca, after a full confession had been extracted from him. I he ban on football in Jedda (see paragraph 157) was removed immediately after the defeat of Ibn Rifada. Death of the Kaimakam of Jedda. 248. Hajji Abdullah Ali Riza, who became Governor of Jedda in the time of King Hussein and was confirmed in the post with the old title of kaimakam by Ibn Saud. died at Taif on the 24th August after an illness of several weeks, lie enjoyed a great reputation for sagacity, and, even after ceasing a year or two ago to play much part in the effective government of Jedda, he continued to be consulted by the King on many occasions. Many deprecated the maintenance of a system by which the leading merchant of the town was its highest admini strative official. In business he was a hard bargainer and a keen mind very well informed, thanks to the extensive connexions of his firm m India and else where In personal intercourse he was an old gentleman of great charm, and endeared himself to successive British representatives, always maintaining friendly relations with the Agency and Legation. On his death the post was converted into an Amirate and was filled by the appointment of Abdul Aziz-bin- Muammar. previously Governor of Yanbu. This gentleman is a Nejdi fiom the Qasim, but is well spoken of. [571 dd—2] B 36 Chapter II .—Frontier (Questions. Transjordan. ^49. Any few incidents which occurred on the frontier in July and August were so bound up in the general situation, even if they were not directly connected with the rebellion, that they are not worth describing. An important general question arose, however, as to the lie of the frontier itself. The Hejazi Govern ment had complained on the 9th August of a visit by Captain Glubb's patrols to Haditha, a place west by north-west of Qaf. This was being dealt with as a routine matter, when the authorities in Transjordan discovered that a small Nejdi post had been established at Haditha for some weeks, asserted a strong claim of their own to Haditha and asked that His Majesty's Government should protest. They were the more perturbed as the Governor of Qaf was said to intend also to occupy Hazim, an important water point, which has always been regarded as J ransjordanian, although Fuad Bey Hamza made a formal reservation on the subject in conversation with Sir A. Ryan last January. 250. As the frontier has never been delimited on the ground and there are various defects in the available maps, the question of Haditha assumed in August a very delicate character. Ihe authorities in Transjordan consider their claim to be incontestable, but it became a matter for consideration whether this claim could be asserted without raising an acute question and possibly a controversy regarding the frontier as a whole. His Majesty's Government were still examining the matter in consultation with General Wauchope at the end of August. Meanwhile the Hejazi Government have kept up a small but persistent stream of protests against alleged violations of the frontier at Haditha and else where by aeroplanes, cars and patrols from Transjordan. As they all hung together, all remained unanswered up to the end of August. ^ 251. Permission was given by the Transjordan Government in June for Sultan-al-Atrash to settle in Transjordan, not further north than Kerak. Iraq. 252. Nothing was heard in July or August of any development at Judaidat- al-Arar (see paragraph 187). See paragraph 269 below* as regards political relations. Koweit and Bahrein. 253. I here is little to record in connexion with the various questions adverted to in paragraph 189 of the last report, with one important exception. On the 19th August Sir A. Ryan, having first prepared the ground in conversation with luad Bey, addressed to him under instructions two communications. One was an official note suggesting that effect should be given to the one practicable proposal which emerged from Colonel Biscoe's discussions on the question of the Koweit blockade wffien he visited the King at Hasa last January, namely, that His Majesty and the Sheikh of Koweit should appoint commissioners to discuss the whole question and seek a solution which would enable trade to be resumed. At the same time Sir A. Ryan wrote a personal letter drawing attention to the large claims of Koweit against Nejd, and intimating that they would be waived, if a satisfactory settlement were reached in the trade negotiations. 254. Ibn Sand's reaction was most disconcerting. He refused to proceed w ith the proposal for a mixed commission, until the question of the claims, which, he suggested, \\eie being used as a threat, w r as disposed of. He contended that he and the Sheikh had mutually w r aived all past claims by an exchange of letters written after Colonel Biscoe's visit, and, he asserted, as a result of a conversation during that visit. Fuad Bey sent copies of the two letters in question to Sir A. Ryan. The latter knew of their existence and understood them to refer only to small every day claims arising out of minor frontier incidents, such as had been under discussion for some time. He put this view forward in a further personal letter to Fuad Bey of the 26th August, and urged in any case that the King should not let the question of claims stand in the way of the proposal to appoint commissioners. 1 his letter produced no effect, for Fuad Bev informed the Minister orally on the 29th August that the King would not move from his attitude. Thus the whole situation called for a fresh examination at the end of August.255. The authorities in the Persian Gulf have adduced strong reasons for formally denouncing the old agreement that transit dues should not be charged in Bahrein on goods for Nejd unloaded over the ship's side into dhows. The question is still under consideration. 5 256. Ibn Saud sent special messages of sympathy to His Majesty s Govern ment and Lady Biscoe on the occasion of the death of Sir Hugh Biscoe on the 19th July. A sir and Yemen. 257. There have been no developments in this direction, apart from the activities of the parties to the Ad-Dabbagh conspiracy, which do not appear to have produced any actual effect of importance in Asir, but contributed to the perturbation of Ibn Saud over the general situation described earlier. Chapter III.— Foreign Relations. General. Hejazi Mission. 258. The Amir Feisal s mission did not get on to Persia as quickly as was thought when paragraph 194- of the last report was written. Ihey apparently stayed a night in Tiflis towards the end of June, date uncertain, reached Baku on the 28th June, and embarked in a special steamer for Resht. They reached Tehran on the 1st July and left for Khaniquin on the 5th July, arriving there on the 7th July. They travelled by special train to Bagdad and got there next day. They left Bagdad in Royal Air Force aeroplanes for Koweit early on the llth July, and after a short stay there proceeded by car to Riyadh, which was reached on the 18th July. The Amir was much impressed by Baku and its oil industry. No account has yet reached Jedda of the visit to lehran. The \isit to Bagdad appears to have been eminently successful, and certainly helped to consolidate relations between Hejaz-Nejd and Iraq, (see paragraph 269). King Feisal lent the Amir his country house and they were entertained at dinner by His Majesty on the 8th July, by the Acting Prime Minister on the 9th July, aiid by Sir F. Humphrys on the 10th July. Great Britain. General. 259. The general relations between His Majesty’s Government and Hejaz- Nedj remained very friendly during July and August. They were completely dominated by the Ibn Rifada affair, which was the subject of further correspondence and of innumerable conversations between Sir A. Ryan and first Sheikh Yussuf Yasin, then Fuad Bey. The policy of Ibn Saud has been to detach Great Britain, his dearest friend, from the Amir Abdullah, his deadliest enemy, with the object of ruining Abdullah and finding a basis for future relations with Transjordan such that the Amir will play no role or be completely guaranteed by His Majesty’s Government. Harameyn Waqfs. 260. Some further correspondence has passed on this subject, but there has been no important development. Claims. 261. No progress has been made towards a settlement of the money questions outstanding between His Majesty s Government and Ibn Saud. Sir A. Ryan took an opportunity 7 of bringing them all up to date in conversation with Sheikh Yussuf Yasin at the end of July, but he got no money paid. There was some little prospect in August of a direct settlement between Shell and the Minister of Finance regarding the benzine affair on the'basis of proposals discussed last May between Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman and Messrs. Gellatly 7 , Hankey and Co.France. 262. Mme. Maigret, the aged mother of the French Charge d'Affaires, died in Jedda on the night of the 8th August, and was temporarily interred in the other-than-Moslem cemetery. 263. M. Maigret, accompanied by a Syrian Christian member of his staff, went to Taif on the 13th August for a twenty-four hours’ change. This visit, which constitutes a breach in the practice of not allowing European representa tives to go there, or, indeed, to any other place beyond the vicinity of Jedda, is understood to have been made by M. Maigret in a private capacity. Both he and M. Choukri wore iVrab dress. Italy. 264. The Italo-Hejaz-Nejd Treaty of Friendship and Commercial Treaty of the 10th February last (see paragraph 59), which were ratified at Rome on the 22nd April, were given the force of law in Italy as from the 3rd June, the law being published on the 4th August. For evidence of Hejazi interest in Sidky Pasha's conversations in Rome see paragraph 267. Soviet Russia. 265. The Soviet Minister held aloof from Sir A. Ryan throughout July and August, possibly from some obscure political motive, as their relations have always been friendly. M. Turacoulov, who now invariably wears Arab (Nejdi) headgear, makes not infrequent visits to Mecca. He is understood to have been pursuing negotiations, presumably regarding a proposed Soviet loan and Hejazi trading facilities (see paragraph 207). T urkey. 268. The Turkish Charge d'Affaires, Lutfullah Bey, returned from leave on the 31st August as a corpse, and was buried the same afternoon in the Moslem cemetery and the presence of his colleagues; who, for the second time in two years, attended a Turkish representative's funeral. The cause of his death seems to have been an attack of tertiary malaria in the Red Sea on board a Soviet ship, further aggravated by whisky, terminating in heart failure. Egypt. 267. On the 31st August Fuad Bey wrote privately and confidentially to Sir A. Ryan to draw his attention to a report in the Cairo “ Akram ” to the effect that recent events in the Hejaz had been discussed on the occasion of Sidky Pasha's visit to Rome. He asked him to seek His Majesty's Government's views on the matter. Sir Andrew rode him off by suggesting, in a final conversa tion before his departure on leave, that whereas Egypt had a natural interest in Hejazi affairs, she had not, as at present governed, any such interest as would lead her into an Arabian adventure. He added the view that, as regards Italy, she was nowadays keenly interested in all foreign affairs, but was not interested in the Hejaz in any such way as need cause anxiety. Fuad Bey left it at that, but betrayed continued suspicion of the Egyptian representative at Jedda (see paragraph 208). / racf. 268. The visit of the Amir Feisal's mission to Bagdad early in July produced an amelioration of the relations between Iraq and the Hejaz-Nejd. The question of the location of the Iraqi Legation was discussed and a tentative agreement reached whereby it is to be at Jedda, but the Iraqi representative will have access to Mecca and will be allowed to have an unofficial residence there. Shortly afterwards the Iraqi Government decided to replace Dr. Naji al Asil by a new Charge d’Affaires, Colonel Rashid Bey, Iraqi consul-general at Beirut. Their Legation at Jedda is temporarily in charge of Abdel Kadir Bey al Gaylani, a vice-consul from Cairo, who arrived on the 28th August, and calls himself Charge d'Affaires. Dr. Naji's first secretary, who also has Hashimite associations, has been transferred.269. It is now the fashion in high Hejazi circles to acclaim King Feisal as a. good neighbour, a sterling Arab and a reasonable man to deal with in contrast with ex-King Ali, who is mistrusted, and the Amir Abdullah, who is much more mistrusted and detested as well. Chapter IV.— Air Matters. Hejazi Air Force. 270. As a result of the study given in London to the renewed suggestion that a Royal Air Force mission should be sent to Jedda (see paragraph 215), Sir A. Ryan was requested to explain the difficulties to the Hejazi Government. He did so in conversation with Fuad Bey Hamza on the 11th August, handing him at the same time a memorandum, unofficial because the matter was being- dealt with personally, in which the difficulties regarding personnel, language, conditions at Jedda, cost and technical considerations were exposed, and precise indications were sought as to whether the Hejazis wanted to build up a fighting unit capable of ultimate expansion or merely to create a small unit for communication purposes, using a simple type of aircraft. This memorandum Fuad Bey took away to study at leisure. A erial Trespass. 271. See paragraph 250 (Transjordan frontier). General. 272. Chapter V.— Military Matters. See paragraphs 239 to 247 (internal situation). Chapter Yl—Naval Matters. British. 273. H.M.S. “Hastings” (Captain C. S. Sandford, R.N.) left northern Red Sea waters for Malta on the 23rd July. H.M.S. I enzance (Commander A R Farquhar, R.N.) remained in northern waters for some time after the actual defeat of Ibn Rifada, in case of further developments, which failed, however, to materialise; then proceeded via Kosseir to Jedda, arriving on the 30th August. Foreign. 274. Nil. Chapter VII.— Pilgrimage. Indian. 275 As a normal aftermath of pilgrimage 258 Indian destitutes were repatriated on the 28th July at a cost to the Government of India of £/7t&gt;. they were, however, fewer in number than last year, and formed a lowei peicentage o the total Indian pilgrimage. Pilgrimage Report. 276. His Majesty's Minister's comprehensive survey of the 1932 (ATI. 1350) pilgrimage was completed for despatch on the 1st ^eptembei. 1933 (A.H. 1351) Pilgrimage. 277. As a result of last season's unpleasant experiences (see paragraphs 91 to 96) and of the representations made by the Legation and many leading pilgrims the Heiazi Government have apparently taken their lessons to heart, at least in theory, and have promulgated an early and much improved pilgrimage tariff for next season, including transport charges. This was communicated to the Legation on the 9th August; it is being attentively studied and will be circulated in due course to the interested Governments of the Lmpire.Two others two women There was Chapter Vlll—Slavery. Manumissions. 278. Two female slaves were in hand at the beginning of July.

Ibn Saud. 280. King Abdul Aziz (Ibn Saud) returned to Nejd in the beginning of September, having spent just five busy and critical months in the Hejaz—the first two devoted to pilgrimage and civil affairs, the last three to quelling rebellion. He left Taif, the summer resort of his western capital, on the 6th September and [655 f—1| barrived at his eastern capital, Riyadh, on the 8th September. He was accom panied by his three surviving brothers, sons numbers 4, 7, 9, 13, 15 and 16, a couple of nephews, and the usual ex-enemy Rashidi young. Sons 1 and 3, the Amirs Saud and Muhammad, met him at Riyadh, son 2, the Amir Feisal, remained in the Hejaz as his Viceroy and apparently in charge of his seven other little brothers. The family removal this year seems to have been less complete and to have been attended by much less pomp and expenditure than in 1931 {vide duly report, paragraph 1). ?\or did it receive the same press attention. 281. It seems that before leaving Taif, Ibn Sand convened a family conference to discuss succession to his throne. He himself wished to name his eldest son as heir apparent. His elder brother Muhammad apparently agreed, thus belying or abandoning the stubborn claim to the succession which he was believed to have upheld for so long. The King's second and younger brother, Abdullah, appears to have been more interested in making sure that the family allowances would continue to be paid. His second son, Feisal, is said to have raised no objection to Saud s inheritance of the throne. And so it was agreed, according to hearsay, which may in fact be no more than intelligent guesswork. But the information given in paragraph 287 below confirms the result, if not the steps by which it was reached. 282. It is further said that the King has now made over his political diwan ’ to the Amir Saud, watching his methods, guiding his actions and retaining for himself only a reduced Royal “ diwan ” headed by Sheikh Yussuf Yasin and manned by a few clerks. It is too soon to be able to state whether this is strictly true or not, but it is not altogether improbable, although even the enlightened Philip of Macedon did not go quite so far in the kingly education of Alexander the Great. 283. Ibn Saud was more given to deeds than words during the months which passed after his Meccan oration of May {vide paragraph 155). He granted the more readily, no doubt, if he did not actually command, an interview with the rising Mecca newspaper, Saut-al-Hijaz, or' Voice of the Hejaz, which was published just after His Majesty left for Riyadh. It contained much rambling, indecisive comment on the ibn' Rifada rebellion and Arab unity, reported in Legation despatch No. 399 of the 23rd September. Change of Title. 284. As from the 22nd September the title of “ the Hejaz and Nejd and its Dependencies ‘ was changed by Royal decree to that of “ Saudi Arabia.” There is sometimes much in a name. Here is Ptolemy’s 2nd century “ Arabia Deserta ” that geographic, nomadic interval between provincial “ Arabia Petraea ” in the north and the verdant, settled southern fringes called “Arabia Felix”— taking 20th century form and individuality as “ Arabia Saudiya.” Between whiles, this same space produced one of the great brotherhood religions of the world, which divided the world at large and failed to unite even its own faithful. It has since thrown up military chieftains of its own and suffered invasions and partial occupation by others, but none have left their mark. Recently, it has bred a king, who for thirty-two years now has combined religious fervour with military force and political activity, to impose himself and effective unity on its inhabitants, and finally to mark its map with his name. 28o. Time has begun its test. The first reaction has been vainglorious. The Government press has tried to make believe that the change of title was made in response to an Arabia-wide appeal, which sprang spontaneously from the heartfelt conviction that Hejazis and Nejdis are brothers. There is every reason on the contrary to believe that the response was decided upon before the appeal was engineered. It was then launched simultaneously, telegraphically and by wireless, from all over the country on the word from Mecca. The press has also been claiming for Saudi Arabia the premier position in the pan-Arabia to be. This attitude is, no doubt, calculated to impress the politicians of Bagdad, news of whose preparation for a pan-Arab conference this winter, coupled with evidence of King FeisaTs penchant to embrace Syria, has not been welcome to some of their Arab brothers further south. So the Mecca press has been lauding the past glories of Arabia Deserta, which only faded when unity was lost, anil boasting of the present unity and strength of Arabia Saudiya, affirming that Allah oidarned the peninsula as the centre of all Arab union, a country geographically apart and militarily secure, so that he who holds it must needs bestrong and able to protect his neighbours. It looks as though Ibn Saud is now setting himself to win hegemony. 286. In this connexion, it is worth noting that at the beginning of September propaganda on behalf of Ibn Saud was being spread in Palestine by leaders of the Istiqlal party and Syrian Nationalists, with whom both Sheikh Yussuf Yasin and luad Bey Hamza appear to be closely connected. New Constitution. 287. T he Royal edict decreeing the change of title also charged the Council of Ministers with the task of drawing up a new Constitution to replace that of 1926, and of establishing the succession to the throne. The Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs informed His Majesty's Charge d'Aftaires on the 15th October that the drafting of the Constitution would take two years, and that the succession to the throne would be vested in the King's eldest son. Ministry for Foreign A ffairs. 288. The Under-Secretary, who had come to Jedda on the 29th August, and then received from His Majesty’s Minister his own and the Amir Feisal’s Grants of Dignity in the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire, had a final inter view with Sir Andrew Ryan on the 1st September and returned to Taif the same day. The Amir Feisal came to Jedda on the 23rd September in his capacity as Viceroy to attend the local celebration of the previous day's Id at Tauhid—Union Day (see paragraph 284). He returned the next day but was back again on the 27th September, in the same capacity, to receive the new Italian Minister’s credentials. The only contact made on foreign affairs was when the Under secretary visited Jedda from the 13th to the 18th October. His Majesty’s Charge d Affaires had some talk with him on the 15th. The Foreign Ministry’s Assistant Secretary still functions in Jedda as an animated telephone connexion with the seat of Government. His quality may be judged by the tale that, when asked by way of polite telephonic overture to business how he is, he is apt to reply precipitately that he must ask his Government. Finance. 289. Throughout October a new Regulation respecting the Ministry of Finance ' has been given piecemeal to the public in the press and is still appearing in serial form. It makes dull reading. Of more moment is the chronic constipation of the Treasury. To shift the metaphor a little further on, the Treasury would seem to have all the properties of a septic tank if it were not for the strong suspicion that, not only are the drains defective, but there is also a lucrative overflow, set very low, into a royal reservoir. While it is said by those “ in the know that the tank contains two trapped compartments in the shape of safes, labelled “ Reserve Fund ” and “ Debts,” built in by the “ budget ” of 1931 (see November-December report, paragraph 4), and now filled with liquid gold, nevertheless officials’ salaries are still five months in arrear (except the Director of Customs, who has managed to get some months ahead), all foreign creditors have whistled themselves dry (including the Soviets, who started whistling last), such drafts on Customs as have been accepted by local creditors, e.g., officials, are being passed in Mecca at 34 per cent, of their face value, the market rate of the riyal is 18J to the gold £ as against the official rate which is still 10 (thus involving the original holders of drafts given for gold debt in a final loss of about 80 per cent.), and, even more noteworthy, the Finance Minister has had to raise a private loan of £1,100 in order to humour the Amir Feisal and eke out his £200 deposit for a new Isotto-Fraschini, delivered strictly for cash against documents. There was no apparent difficulty, however, in producing £1,500 similarly required for the King’s Isotto. Nor is it thought that the Finance Minister fails to draw the 12,000 rivals or some £675 a month, to which he is stated on good authority to be entitled from the privy purse, or reservoir. All of which goes to show where the money goes and where it does not, how the Finance Minister is the King's man and no one else’s, but how also he will avoid bad blood and oblige the Viceroy, if it can be done without tapping the tank. He probably has as little compunction, however, in keeping the Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs short of money as he evidently has in keeping spies to watch him but [655 f-1] B 2J Mtr % then “ it's all fair pulling.’’ Meanwhile he is building himself a country seat near Jedda. 290. The Government's external debt still amounts to nearly £200,000 gold. It is comprised of some £50,000 owing to the Poles (vide paragraph 70), at least £25,000 owing to the Bahrein Qusaibis, £30.000 to the Soviets, £15,000 to the Shell Company, £15,000 to the Standard Oil Company, £15,000 to the Marconi Company, £10,000 to the Government of India, £10,000 to German firms, £5,000 to the Nederlandische Handel-Maatschappij, £2,500 to the Eastern Telegraph Company, and £1,700 to His Majesty's Government. £40,000 worth of these commitments mature finally in November (most of the rest are rotten with age), and £25,000 worth have been discounted and even rediscounted in Europe. Perhaps the safe marked “ Debts ' really has got something in it. t Eco7iomics. 291. Hejazi merchants placed some £150,000 abroad during the summer, it was reliably learned in October, in payment chiefly for stocks for the coming pilgrimage, about which hopes have run unreasonably high. An all-round increase of customs dues is being considered. In October some £500 worth of contraband tobacco was publicly burned in Mecca; it is easy to smuggle into creeks by dhow, especially to the north of Jedda. It was only burned by the authorities because they found no money in it, the duty on tobacco being 90 piastres a kilog., while this stuff was of a grade which would not fetch at auction more than 35 piastres a kilog. Rather than attempt to sell it retail, they preferred to rid the market of it in the hope, perhaps fond, that importers would now patronise the Customs. Wireless. 292. Saudi Arabia is now knit by a network of twenty-two wireless stations, the last of which is in process of completion at Riyadh; these are supplemented by six mobile sets. The two capital stations, Mecca and Riyadh, are relatively powerful—6 kw. Marconis. The rest are \ kw. installations, nine of them consisting of modern Marconi telegraphy and telephony plant, but with single aerial permitting only one-way communication—namely, those at A1 Ula, Tabuk, Qaf or Qaryat-al-Milh, Skaka, Bureyda, Jubail, Qatif, Uqair and Hufuf; the other eleven are old Turkish-installed Telefunken telegraphy plants, namely, those at Jizan, Abba, Qunfida. Taif, Jedda, Rabigh, Yanbu, Medina, A1 Wejh, Dhaba, and Hail. All these latter, except the last, are relics of the Turkish domination of Asir and the Hejaz; that at Hail is a relic of their association with the then semi-independent Rashidi Amirate. 293. Thus Ibn Saud now has a chain of seven wireless stations in Red Sea ports, a string of six stations a little way inland of these, a line of five stations down the centre of the peninsula and a group of four stations on the Persian Gulf; plus four mobile motor plants and two hand sets. Legislation. 294. Part of a “ Regulation to Facilitate Business Transactions ' was published in September. A “ Regulation Respecting the Ministry of Finance ' began publication in October. ('ommittee of Virtue. 295. As is usual between pilgrimage seasons, this Puritan committee's! soldiers have recently again been maltreating the Mecca population, which from nil accounts thoroughly deserves it. Locusts. 296. As a result of a further attempt by Sir Andrew Ryan, made in conversation with Fuad Bey Hamza on the 1st September, to induce some sort of co-operation in the Saudi Government by the observation and reporting of locust swarms, a short memorandum was prepared in the Legation summarising in simple form the kind of information required. This Fuad Bey undertook in October to have distributed in Arabic, with a further promise to furnish the Legation with any reports received from the interior. The Nejd breeding grounds are believed to be of importance.II.— Frontier Questions. Transjordan. Raiding. 297. No raids either way were reported as having taken place during September and October. When the old matter of liquidating the raid of the 28th September, 1931, and thereby other raids of the past, was resuscitated, the Saudi Arab Government replied on the 23rd October still maintaining that the victims, the Atun section of the Huweytat, were their subjects and should have come to them for justice. Aftermath of Rebellion. 298. British military forces were withdrawn from the Aqaba area on the 2nd September, the Arab Legion taking it over. The Transjordan authorities reported on the 3rd September that the economic blockade of the disaffected area had been raised. By the middle of the month between 200 and 300 refugees had been disarmed and dispersed in Transjordan and into Sinai. Only a part of the Beni Atiya rebel contingent under Ibn Farhan remained unaccounted for in the Hisma country south of the border. All property in the Hejaz of rebels and their sympathisers was confiscated by a decree of the 2nd September. Mutual Recognition. 299. On the 1st September His Majesty's High Commissioner for Trans jordan drew from the Amir Abdullah the promise that in deference to His Majesty’s Government's wishes he was ready to recognise Ibn Saud unconditionally as King of the Hejaz and Nejd. He begged that recognition should be mutual. On the 11th September King Feisal visited Amman and the Arabic press soon afterwards announced that he had persuaded his brother to recognise Ibn Saud. His Majesty's Government’s views as to the establishment of future relations were conveyed to Ibn Saud on the 6th October. His reply of the 13th October announced his readiness to recognise the Amir Abdullah as ruler of Transjordan and to enter treaty negotiations under certain conditions. Beni A tiya. 300. Half-way through October the Acting High Commissioner for Trans jordan decided as a disciplinary measure to remove certain sections of the Beni Atiya, who were still camped at Kerak, back into the Hejaz. At his urgent request His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires informed the Saudi Arab Government of the decision Although they agreed to the move, it was delayed pending a full discussion between the Transjordan authorities and His Majesty’s Government of a number of points of principle as well as detail. Haditha. 301. This place (vide paragraphs 249 and 250) was found in October to be on the Nejdi side of the frontier. So a formula was prepared in which this information was conveyed to the Saudi Government in such a way as not to commit His Majesty's Government irrevocably. Iraq. 302. News was received in September that a little frontier friction caused by an over-zealous Iraqi official in July had been satisfactorily removed and the man punished. A somewhat similar case which had also arisen in July, but from the Nejdi side, does not seem to have been settled, nor has anything more been heard of the Judaidat-al-Arar dispute (vide paragraph 252). Koweit and Bahrein. “ Blockade 'of Koweit. 303. Although the practical difficulties raised by Ibn Saud to the dutying of his subjects’ imports over the Koweit frontier do not seem to affect their very [655 f—1] b 36 similar trade across the Iraq frontier, as one might be led to expect, discussion of the blockade, in which this argument might have been used, has not been renewed at Jedda. But it is now clear that argument will take as little effect on Ibn Saud as an appeal to his good nature. There is reason to believe that he is bent on reducing Koweit, by hook or by crook, to a state of dependence on himself, an attitude which it will take some more material lever to correct. Bahrein Transit Dues. 304. Dues recently levied on goods from India delivered overside at Bahrein in transhipment to the Nejdi mainland having been paid by Ibn Saud’s agents without demur, it was decided that it was unnecessary formally to denounce the old concession of 1920 (vide paragraphs 49. 191 and 255). .4 sir and the Yemen. 305. There has been no disturbance apparent in the one nor impairment of relations with the other. III. —Foreign Relations. General. International Health Bureau. 306. Two Saudi Arab delegates sailed on the 9th September to attend the Paris October meetings for the first time, one a Syrian doctor with a murderous reputation, the other a Syrian jack of all trades, who has hitherto been employed in buying arms. Great Britain. His Majesty's Minister. 307. Sir Andrew Ryan left Jedda in H.M.S. Penzance on the 2nd September for three and a half months’ leave of absence. Mr. Hope Gill assumed the duties of Charge d’Affaires. General. 308. There was a welcome relaxation in relations from the close contacts of the previous three months necessitated by the rebellion. The progress made in matters affecting Transjordan, pilgrimage, and slavery is reported in chapters II, VII and VIII. Claims. 309. No progress was made, in spite of considerable haggling between the Ministry of Finance and the Shell Company's agents, supported by the Legation, for the settlement of the benzine debt of a year back. France. 310. The French Charge d'Affaires, M. Maigret, went on short leave on the 14th September, leaving the French consulate in the charge of a Syrian clerk. Italy. 311. Commendatore Ottavio de Peppo, first Italian Minister to this country, reached Jedda on the 25th September and presented his credentials two days later. He is accompanied by a diplomatic secretary, M. Tonci, who has served in Morocco and Tunis and knows some Arabic. 312. On his passage down the Red Sea to Eritrea in October, the King of Italy exchanged wireless greetings with Ibn Saud. 313. Some more virulent anti-Italian propaganda in Arabic was received during September in the Legation, and no doubt elsewhere, by post from Syria (vide July-August report 1931, paragraph 57).Soviet Russia. 314. In spite of a series of conversations held in Jedda in October between the Soviet Minister and the Saudi Minister of Finance supported by Fuad Bey Hamza, no substantial progress seems to have been achieved towards a Soviet loan or facilities for Soviet trade. It is thought that M. Turacoulov has been made to press more insistently than he would have liked for payment for the Soviet benzine supplied in 1931. Turkey. 315. The Saudi Arab Government are arranging to send a mission to Turkey to receive military and aeronautical instruction and a press notice issued on the 16th September called for volunteers. On the 10th October the Turkish Ambassador in London informed the Secretary of State that his Government were on the point of sending two Turkish officers to Ibn Saud with 100 rifles and two mitrailleuses, ordered by the Amir Feisal when at Angora last June, but no ammunition. They would also inspect and repair some cannon dating from the Ottoman occupation. Ferit Bey apparently made no mention of the mission {cf. paragraph 65). Iraq. 316. Frontier relations are mentioned in paragraph 302. 317. On the occasion of Iraq’s entry into the League of Nations Ibn Saud telegraphed to King Feisal that be shared his brother’s and the Iraq nation’s delight and pleasure. An equally warm response was wirelessed back. 318. The Iraqi Charge d’Affaires elect seems unready to come to Jedda. One of the first questions which he will have to tackle is an apparent usurpation by the Saudi Government of the revenues of all Hashimite properties in the Hejaz. IV.— Air Matters. Saudi A ra,b A ir Force. 319. There has been no response to the memorandum regarding a possible Royal Air Force mission which was handed to Fuad Bey Hamza on the 11 th August (vide paragraph 270), but, as described in paragraph 315, prepara tions are being made to send a Saudi Arab mission to Turkey for instruction. Emergency Landing Grounds. 320. Imperial Airways began on the 1st October to use the Arabian instead of the Persian Coast for their eastern airway. No arrangements had by then been made for placing at their disposal the emergency landing grounds discussed in May (vide paragraph 217), nor had the Air Ministry’s statement of desiderata been received at the Legation by the end of October. 321. His Majesty’s High Commissioner for Iraq telegraphed to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires on the 26th September the information that on the 10 th September a Rangoon flying-boat had forced-landed at Jinna through engine trouble, but that spares had been flown to it the following day, enabling it to proceed to Bahrein. Owing to the lapse of time the Saudi Government were not informed, nor have they remarked on the matter. V. —Military Matters. Military Mission. 322. The proposed despatch of a military mission to Turkey for instructions and the expected arrival of two Turkish officers with arms for Ibn Saud have been noted in paragraph 315. General. 323. The aftermath of the rebellion is reported in paragraph 298. By October all the Akhwan levies collected in the Northern Hejaz and at Taif to deal with Ibn Rifada and any concurrent trouble seem to have dispersed into Nejd.ribal leaders are said to have collected at Riyadh in some numbers to meet Ibn baud alter his return to Nejd and draw on his bounty. Nothing is known of what, if anything, transpired between them and the King in regard to his promise, reported in paragraph 245, in which he undertook to keep them informed 0 ic piogiess of his negotiations with His Majesty’s Government vis-a-vis 1 rans Jordan. British. VI.— hi aval Matters. .u 24 on.i H A M ' S ' PenZ(mce (Commander A. R. Farquhar, R.N.) arrived at Jedda on the 30th August and embarked His Majesty’s Minister and sailed for Port feudan on the 2nd September. H-M.S. Hastings (Captain C. S. Sandford, R.N.) altered programme somewhat in order to he at Port Sudan from the 22nd to the 26th September, in case naval assistance should be required at Jedda for the embarkation of a slave manumitted by the Legation (vide chapter VIII). Foreign. * I he , n ^ Persian fleet, consisting of six small, diesel-driven coastal units of under 1,000 tons visited Jedda from the 5th to the 7th October, on their way from Italy to the Gulf. They made a good impression. VII.— Pilqrimaqe. Indian. number of questions affecting the Indian pilgrimage has been treated with the Government of India. Consideration was given to a compre- lensive memorandum by the Government of India on various matters raised in the Legation s pilgrimage reports for 1930 and 1931. The Government propose to deal with these reports in future soon after they are received; this should much acihtate the work of all engaged in the Indian pilgrimage organisation. On tne oth October the Legation forwarded to the Government of India a tentative estimate of the cost in rupees of the 1933 (1351) pilgrimage. This was made out m detail for three grades of traveller, first-class steamer and by car, second-class steamer and by bus, and deck passage and by camel. The totals came to (1) 1,700 rupees or about £130; (2) 1,225 rupees, or about £90; and (3) 570 rupees or about £45; the expenses being reckoned from home to home. Javanese. 328. The prospects of the coming Javanese pilgrimage, the earliest to start and generally the most numerous of all, are extremely bad. A sum equivalent to 29,000 rupees, or something over £2,000, has been subscribed in Java to enable some of the large numbers of pilgrims of former years, now destitute in Mecca, to leturn home. Jhe Saudi Arab Government, however, are endeavouring to defer anything like a mass repatriation until after the pilgrimage from fear of its adverse effect on would-be pilgrims. Propaganda. 329. The Saudi Arab Government are maintaining agents and subsidising newspapers in India, Java and elsewhere to advertise the pilgrimage. This propaganda is likely to be more marked than last year An enlarged edition of the pilgrimage propaganda pamphlet has been distributed wholesale in various languages. VIII.— Slavery. M anumissions. 330. The two male slaves who had taken refuge in the Legation in August were manumitted and repatriated to Abyssinia in September. One belonged to the Assistant Governor of Jedda, the other to a leading merchant, and efforts were made by the authorities to detain both by charging them with theft; but thesewere successfully set aside. Another Abyssinian took refuge and was repatriated in October. Local emancipation was secured for a female Abyssinian, who took refuge in September and was willing to return to her master as a free woman, her Sharia document of freedom being bled in the Legation. 331. Four Sudanis also took refuge. Two were got away to Port Sudan without difficulty. One, who had escaped from the King's elder brother, the Amir Muhammad, was claimed by the Saudi Arab Government, on the ground that he was a Royal slave, ft looked as though it might be even more difficult to get him away than it proved to embark Bakhit {vide paragraphs 100 to 105), and steps were taken to have a sloop in readiness at Port Sudan to visit Jedda if necessary. But the Saudi Arabs responded to no more than reason, and the man was allowed to embark without incident, accompanied by a senior member of the Legation. The fourth Sudani slave is still in hand. Enslavement of Pilgrims. 332. A case of the alleged selling of his wife into slavery at Medina by a Nigerian pilgrim was brought to the notice of the Saudi Arab Government by the Legation in October, with a request for its investigation and for the release of the woman and punishment of the man, if proved. IX.— Miscellaneous. Staff. 333. Sir Andrew Ryan went on three and a half months’ leave on the 2 nd September. Mr. Hope Gill took over from the Minister as Charge d’Affaires. C aptain Lewis left Jedda on the 28th September, on resignation after twenty- one months’ service as second archivist. Mr. R. V.

I HAVE the honour to forward herewith the Jedda report for November and December 1932. This report has been compiled by Mr. Hope Gill, who was in charge of the Legation during nearly the whole of the period under review. I have made no material alterations in the report as drafted by him. 2 . It has been found in practice that the system of preparing these reports at intervals of two months has not produced the advantages which were anticipated when it was introduced at the beginning of 1931. 1 he labour involved in compiling them from the mass of material which accumulates in a post of varied activities has been heavy, and there has been a tendency to over- systematise the reports in an efiort to make them comprehensive. There has consequently been frequent delay in issuing the reports, and I think that the) have become too unwieldy for the purposes of some of the recipients while are already familiar from current correspondence with the subjects which interest them. . , • i ] ^ 3 Having discussed the matter with your Department while on lea\e. 1 propose to return to the system of monthly reports and to make them shorter by dealing only with the salient events of each month in a form resembling a news-letter rather than a systematic account of everything that has happeneck I understand that this will meet your views, and I trust that it will not dimmish the value of the reports to other' recipients. w n . 4 .

(Confidential.) Ibn Saud. I- —Internal Affairs. 334. THE King continued in Nejd during November and December. Very little news of him filtered out. He seems to have spent his time in and about his feudal castle, which is the sum total of Riyadh, receiving tribesmen and occasionally hunting in the neighbourhood. It is thought that the absence of his chauffeur, Siddiq, on motor-bargaining business in Egypt, kept him very much at home until mid-December, for he has a marked antipathy to being driven by anyone other than this graceless Indian, whom, for reasons known to himself, he trusts. 335. Special favour seems to have been shown by Ibn Saud during these two months to leaders of the Ajman and Mutair tribes who paid homage to him at Riyadh. His bounty to them was remarked as exceptional. It served the purpose of encouraging others of these tribes, who had avoided Nejd since the failure of their 1029 rebellion, to consider a return to their former allegiance. Ibn Saud sent out invitations to this end by emissaries to the Mutair in November. His solicitude seems to derive either from gratitude for their behaviour during the Ibn Rifada revolt, when they gave no trouble, or from a desire now to placate them and buy them back; the tribes affect to believe the latter. 336. For the greater part of December Ibn Saud entertained at Riyadh Sheikh Kamil-al-Qassab, Syrian Nationalist and Istiqlal party leader. The Saudi Minister of Finance is believed to have paid a considerable sum to this partisan before he left the country—which he did on the 3rd January—to carry on the good work in Palestine and Syria, also no doubt in the Pan-Arab Congress which may be held in Bagdad. It is of interest to record that a member of the Legation staff remembers seeing Sheikh Kamil begging bounty in Mecca from the Sharif Husain with tears in his eyes and gross flattery; then, disappointed at his meagre dole of Maria Theresa dollars, turning to rend him in the Palestinian press. If he now receives reward from Ibn Saud it is in good gold sovereigns, taken from the Hejaz, withheld from the King’s creditors, and used to further his ambitions. Ministry for Foreign Affairs. 337. The diplomatic diary records but few and brief contacts between Ministry and Legation in the past two months. On the 14th November the l nder-Secretary visited Jedda for two days. He asked His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires to call on him on the 16th, when current matters were discussed and three Saudi memoranda, on the Asir situation (paragraphs 363-6), the Dabbagh conspiracy (paragraph 351) and Bahrein transit dues (paragraph 362) were presented. On the 20th November the Saudi Minister in London landed at Jedda on “ leave,” but went straight through to Mecca. He went on to Riyadh on the 2 nd December, spent a fortnight with his King, and arrived back in Mecca on the 19th December. Fuad Bey Hamza had, meanwhile, visited Jedda again from the 1st to 4th December, but did not inform or get into touch with the Legation. On the 22nd December the Amir Feisal came to Jedda, accompanied by Sheikh Hafiz Wahba and followed the next day by Fuad Bey Hamza. Having received no official intimation of the arrival of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and his Under-Secretary, His Majesty’s Minister, who had returned from leavethe previous day, confined himself to leaving cards on them on the 24th December at the local “ Foreign Office ” building. Hafiz Wahba, however, lunched that day at the Legation in response to a previous invitation while at Mecca. Fuad Hamza called on His Majesty’s Minister on Boxing Day to discuss Asir and connected matters, entertained him and Mr. Hope Gill to lunch in the “ Foreign Office to meet the Amir Feisal, and left with the latter and Hafiz Wahba for Mecca on the same afternoon; Hafiz Wahba was met with again at a picnic luncheon tabled in his honour before forty guests at Wadi Fatima, a palm-grove 15 miles from Mecca, by the Indian vice-consul, a friend of long standing. On the 30th December this sole Saudi Minister Plenipotentiary sailed again for London by way of Egypt, land of his birth. Finance. 338. In paragraph 290 of the last Jedda report it was suggested, not very hopefully, that the Saudi “ Debts Chest ” might, after all, have something in it. November, however, confirmed the ruling pessimism as to its contents, when the Government issued an obscure memorandum, in which they sought to explain what endeavours they had made to meet their creditors and why it was that they had failed. They claimed, nevertheless, to have issued 14 million Amiri piastres’ worth of drafts on Customs. In the “ Debts Chest,” they said, they had enough cash to pay 5 per cent, interest on the remainder of their debts; that is to say, the bulk. This memorandum was circulated to all the Government’s creditors in Jedda, whom it convinced of the Government’s dishonesty. It was sent out a few days before the return to his post of the Government’s financial adviser. M. van Leeuwen had not been consulted in any way in its preparation, and was not even told of it officially nor given a copy when he returned. The same circular was sent to the British Legation with a brief intimation that it would apply to the debts due to His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom, a cavalier proceeding considering the past history of their claims in respect of arms supplied to Ibn Sand by the Government of India in 1929 and the cost of the MacDonnell enquiry. 339. The Cairo Ahram's Jaffa correspondent was reported in the Egyptian Gazette of the 28th December as having stated that, among the ex-Khedive Abbas Hilmi’s financial schemes, was the opening of an Hejazi-Palestinian bank with a capital of a million pounds, to which he would contribute half, Ibn Saud a fifth, from a loan which Abbas Hilmi would make to him, and the United Kingdom, French and Italian Governments a tenth apiece. It was also suggested that, in order to further one of his political ambitions—namely, to secure for himself a throne in Syria, or a throne in Palestine, or the Caliphate—in the Hejaz, the ex-Khedive was ready to render further financial assistance to Ibn Saud, and thereby purchase his support. 340. An error and an omission vitiated the summary of Saudi external indebtedness given in paragraph 290 of the last report. As far as can now be ascertained, this indebtedness stood at the end of December approximately as follows :— Creditor. £ Gold. Service. The Poles 50,000 1930 arms. Government of India 30,000 1929 arms. The Soviets 30,000 1931 oil. The Qusaibis 25,000 (at least) Loans, &amp;c. Mr. Philby 20.000 Fords, machinery, &amp;c. “Shell” 15,000 1931 oil, stolen. *“ Standard Oil ” 15,000 Ditto, partly stolen. *“ Marconi’s” 15,000 (at least) Wireless stations. ^German firms 10,000 Telephones, &amp;c. The “ Dutch Bank” 5,000 Loans. The “ E.T.C.” 2,500 Current account. His Majesty’s Government 1,700 MacDonnell investigation 219,200 (at least) The bills for items marked “ which fell due in November, were not then met and have not yet been replaced by any new arrangement. Possibly they also, [711o—2] b 24 in the Saudi Govei’iiment’s view, ai’e covered by the circular described in paragraph 338. Economics. 341. A proposal has been made to Ibn Sand by some leading Nawabs and other wealthy men of Hyderabad State to start, at their own expense and by sending experts from India, a cotton-spinning and weaving industry in the Hejaz. They hope by this means to counteract some of the helpless poverty which so shocked them when they were on pilgrimage last spring. The scheme owes much to the initiative and advice of the Indian vice-consul, and he was entrusted with the delivery, on the 17th December, of the promoters’ letter to Ibn Saud through the hand of the Minister of Finance. If the scheme can be made to show profit to either of these last two, its political objections may, perhaps, be outweighed. 342. A railway scheme is reported in paragraph 346. Legislation. 343. The “ Regulation respecting the Ministry of Finance ” completed publication in the local press. A “ Regulation governing Motor-car Drivers ” was similarly published in November. It enacts, amongst other necessary rules, that, “ if camels are dismayed at the voice of the horn, the driver must stop the voice of the horn and the motor until they have cleared from the way before him.” A “ Decree concerning the Departure of Debtors,” a busy instrument, was also published in November. On the 25th November, under instructions from His Majesty’s Government, His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires informed the Saudi Arab Government that, in view of the local “ Coastal Fisheries Regulation of July 1932,” in which Saudi Arab territorial waters were defined as extending 4 miles from shore. His Majesty’s Government must reserve all their lights in international law in respect of waters outside the 3-mile limit. Nationality Law. 344. Having discovered by their summer census (see paragraph 237) who in the Hejaz claimed foreign nationality, the Saudi Government set a committee to work in Mecca in late October and early November to summon those people and demand documentary proof of their nationality. Since the committee was reported to be holding on to such passports as were presented and giving those who had none only fifteen days in which to get them, failing which, they were told, they must either adopt Hejazi nationality or quit the country within three months, His Majesty’s Charge d'Affaires enquired of the Saudi Government as to the true nature of the committee's powers. Whereupon the matter was referred to Riyadh and Mr. Hope Gill was assured by Fuad Bey Hamza, on the 16th November, that as far as he knew the report was incorrect. Be that as it may, the committee has not resumed work. Waqfs. 345. The ‘ ‘ Auqaf-al-Harameyn ” Association pursued in November, through the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and the Legation, the matter of a valuable Waqf bequest, which is said to be immobilised in Rangoon. Communications. 346. An Indian doctor from Madras, named Jeelani, who, while on pilgrimage earlier in the year, became imbued with ideas of the need for and commercial possibilities of a railway from Jedda to Mecca, returned in December with a cut-and-dried scheme raised by a firm of Madras engineers on the basis of a 1917 sketch-map, which omitted Mecca, 1920 pilgrimage figures, and contem- porary Indian costs of labour and construction. The doctor seeks a concession from Ibn Sand to build and run this railway, and is ready to give the latter a share in the profits. The latter is holding out for a share in the gross receipts instead. AVhen he gets the concession. Dr. Jeelani will look for the capital, to the tune of 40 lakhs (£300,000). He is already a very old man.JjOC lists. 347. The friendly arrangement for the reporting of swarms, mentioned in paragraph 296 of the last report, bore sterile fruit once in November. The information was so meagre as to be valueless, nor could more be extracted. II. —Frontier Questions. Raiding. Transjordan. 348. Only one raid was reported, made on the 6th November by Beni Atiya from over the border on the Transjordan Howeytat, camped eastward of Bayir. In reply to the Legation's representations, the Saudi Government stated that the raiders had been arrested and that the camels would be returned to Captain Glubb’s representative on demand. It is supposed that all went well. Beni Atiya. 349. After a preliminary scare had died down, raised by a report that Ibn Baud's Ikhwan—a name to conjure with in the tribelands—were waiting across the frontier to eat up the Beni Atiya as soon as they emerged into the Hejaz, the eviction of the majority of this troublesome tribe from Transjordan was carried out with precision and success by the desert police. It was completed by the 20th November, when 110 tents had crossed into Saudi Arabia. Ibn Farhan, the leader of the rebel contingent of this tribe, which had gone to join Ibn Rifada. was caught on the Transjordan side of the frontier on the 18th November and was condemned to a year's imprisonment. Hashimite Intrigue. 350. On the 8th November the Amir Abdullah began what was at first intended to be a tour of his Transjordan corridor, made with the supposed but unavowed intention of meeting with Nuri-ash-Sha'lan, paramount chief of the Ruwalla. Fie was to be accompanied by the tribal sheikhs of Transjordan, among them Selim-abu-Dumeyk, of the Beni Atiya. Observers in Transjordan foresaw, rightly or wrongly, an alliance between Transjordan tribes and the Ruwalla against Ibn Saud. The tour, however, degenerated into a “shooting trip to Asraq,' which the Amir suddenly left on the 15th November for Bagdad, to visit his sick brother Ali. He returned on the 24th November direct to Amman, having apparently not been accompanied in the first instance by Abu Dumeyk, nor having met in the end with Nuri Shalan. 351. On the 16th November the Saudi Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs handed to His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires a lengthy memorandum of the previous day describing ramifications of the anti-Saudi plot which has come to be known as the Dabbagh conspiracy, from the name of its most obvious members. The memorandum connected them with the Amir Abdullah and others of the shereefs in Transjordan. Fuad Hamza supported the accusation, which is no new one, with a bulky file of what he described as intercepted correspondence, from which he drew at apparent random five specimens for Mr. Hope Gill’s perusal. The memorandum itself concluded with an appeal to His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom as allies and friends to prevent territories under their control from being used as bases for anti-Saudi activity. 352. In reporting the gist of this memorandum by telegraph to Flis Majesty's Government, His Majesty Charge d'Affaires stated that the particular specimen documents were not very convincing, but he expressed the view that neither the probability that the Saudi case was a good one, nor the possibility that the conspirators would cause more active trouble, could rightly be ignored. He enquired whether the Saudi Government might be informed in reply of the steps already taken at Aden to deny use of that centre to the conspirators, and be furthermore assured of the authorities' continued surveillance there and extended surveillance in the Hadhramaut. Mr. Hope Gill also asked whether there was any information which could be added regarding measures taken in Transjordan to incapacitate the plotters there, having in* mind the evidence accumulated in British hands against the Amir Abdullah's immediate entourage, if not against the Amir himself, as well as against minor and outlying native officials in Trans jordan. and having no knowledge of anything having been done since the IbnRifada revolt ended either to investigate and punish complicity in Transjordan or to guard against similar abuse of British-controlled territory in the future. 353. On the 23rd November, upon receipt of telegraphic confirmation from Aden that the rising in Asir (which is reported in paragraphs 363 to 366 below) was being fomented by the Dabbaghs, and in view of the importance given in the intercepted plans of these conspirators to simultaneous risings in north and south, His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires made telegraphic enquiry of the High Commissioner for Palestine and Transjordan whether there was any danger of the conspirators’ associates in these countries trying to foment another revolt in the Northern Hejaz. General Wauchope replied that, although there were no indications of any such attempt, it could not be said that there was no possibility of associates in Transjordan communicating with their friends in the Hejaz; watch, however, was being kept. His MajestyV Government had meanwhile informed His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, on the 25th November, that, as regards the Saudi memorandum of the 15th November, it might be preferable not to answer, but that, as regards possible action against anti-Saudi conspirators in Transjordan, the High Commissioner was being requested to expedite his views. Saudi Reaction.. 354. On the 25th November, however, His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires had had cause to telegraph home the gist of a circumstantial local report received from a confidential source, to the effect that a letter from the Amir Abdullah to one of the Dabbagh fraternity had been captured by the Saudi forces in Asir, and that this had decided Ibn Saud to concentrate forces of his Ikhwan near the Transjordan border, preparatory to demanding of His Majesty’s Government the Amir Abdullah’s dismissal. On the 27th November His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires received a second Saudi memorandum, dated the 26th. It was briefer and more incisive in tone than the first and bore signs of having emanated from Ibn Saud himself at Riyadh. It referred to reports from the northern frontier and news from southbound travellers into Nejd, which pointed to unusual activity on the part of the Shereef Abdullah (cf. paragraph 350). It repeated that participation by the shereefs and their associates in the rebellion of Ibn Rifada was established. It recalled the indignation aroused in Nejd by Transjordan intrigue and encouragement of Ibn Rifada’s attempt, and also the difficulty which the Saudi Government had then had in restraining their tribesmen from attacking Transjordan. It ended by pointing out the danger of the tribes of Nejd getting finally out of hand if decisive action were not taken in Transjordan to put an end to anti-Saudi activities. 355. In telegraphing the substance of this memorandum to His Majestv’s Government, His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires observed that something' fairly serious must have occurred to cause Ibn Saud to threaten His Majesty’s Govern ment with the uncontrollability of his Ikhwan. He attributed it to a combination of bad news from Asir, disquieting news from the Transjordan frontier and the absence of evidence of any effective measures taken in Transjordan itself, which had determined Ibn Saud to take his own measures to forestall yet another vicarious aggression by the Amir Abdullah. Mr. Hope Gill expressed the view that if Ikhwan were, in fact, being moved northward, no mere words would restore Ibn Saud’s confidence in His Majesty’s Government to the point of making him check the movement. Once it developed, His Majesty’s Government could only resist it. He submitted the advisability, before it developed, of taking radical action in Transjordan, at least against the Shereef Shakir, who seemed richly to deserve it, if the Shereef Abdullah himself could not, in the interests of major policy, be punished with dismissal. He finally recorded the conviction that in the long run His Majesty’s Government must choose between the Amir Abdullah and Ibn Saud. British Intervention. 356. A serious view of the situation was taken in London. Jerusalem was informed on the 3rd December that the continuance of the position, in which His Majesty’s Government were unable to deny the accusation of hostile activities made by Ibn Saud against the Amir Abdullah and his associates, was embarrassing and ignominious. Unless radical steps were taken in the nearfuture to remedy this position, prejudice, not only to relations with Ibn Saud. but to British interests throughout the Middle East were to be foreseen. The High Commissioner was asked to consider the possibility of really strong representations to the Amir and of immediate drastic action against conspirators in Transjordan, especially those in the Amir’s entourage, the Amir Shakir in particular. If this were done, there would then be material for reply to Ibn Saud. 357. General Wauchope interviewed the Amir Abdullah on the 7th December*. The latter’s reply ended with the statement that he had already promised not to work against Ibn Saud, and he would keep his promise. It appears that he had already dismissed in October one member of his entourage, namely, Abdurrauf-as-Sabban, who was to be relegated to Bagdad. Action has been taken in Transjordan to curb the activities of certain other conspirators from outside, but the principal persons in the Amir’s entourage who have been accused of anti-Saudi activities remained in office at the end of December. His Majesty’s Government were anxiously considering the whole matter. In the meantime no formal reply has been returned to the Saudi memoranda of the 15th and 26th November. The Ikhwan movement has not yet assumed sufficient proportion to cause local anxiety, if, indeed, it has ever started, which is indeterminable, though reports which at one time reached Transjordan from Jauf alleged the arrival there of Ikhwan with many standards. Some fire there probably was. 358. On the 28th December, after taking stock of the situation on his return from leave. His Majesty’s Minister informed His Majesty’s Government that he did not consider an official reply to the Saudi memoranda to be urgent, provided he were given authority to discuss their contents with the Saudi Under-Secretary. He stressed the desirability of securing mutual recognition of their status between Ibn Saud and the Arrlir Abdullah. Mutual Recognition. 359. The draft of a note to the Saudi Arab Government on the subject of this mutual recognition and of the treaty negotiations which should follow, it was prepared in London in November, and sent to the High Commissioner for Transjordan on the 24th for his observations or concurrence. Iraq. 360. The Iraqi-Nejdi frontier seems to have been quiet, for no echoes have been heard. Koweit and Bahrein. Survey of Koweit Neutral Zone. 361. Instructions were received at Jedda in December to notify the Saudi Arab Government that a ground and air survey of the Koweit neutral zone would be undertaken in January. To effect this purpose His Majesty’s Minister awaited the occasion of personal contact with the Saudi Under-Secretary as offering the best method of approach. Bahrein Transit Dues. 362. On the 16th November the Saudi 1 nder-Secretary for Foreign Affairs handed to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires a memorandum entitled “ in respect of improper treatment accorded by the Bahrein Customs Administration to a shipment of cargo for 1 qair. 1 he incident arose from the necessity imposed upon a British ship, apparently by the Bahrein authorities, of unloading all its cargo, including that consigned to Bahrein, on the Hasa Coast, It was utilised by the Saudi Arab Government to raise the whole dormant question of customs duties and transit dues as between Bahrein and the mainland. The memorandum was being considered in December. A sir Revolt. A Hr and the Yemen - 363. A full-scale rebellion broke out in the Idrisi Province of Asir in the early days of November, and gave considerable concern to the Saudi Government«r ^v for two months. Its origins are still obscure. r I hey are thought to he P 1 ’ 1111 ^ 11 &gt; in the resentment of the Idrisi family and Asiri tribesmen against the final incorporation of their country in that of Saudi Arabia, which the renaming o the Kingdom in September had implied and which was manifestly one ot its obiects. Contributory causes seem to have been (1) serious friction between the Saudi Governor of the province and Seyyid Hasan-al-Idnsi, its nominal ruler, friction which the Saudi Government have been at some pains to dehne as personal, but which probably owed much to their policy; (2) advances and promises of support to the Idrisi made by the Dabbagh fraternity, the active southern-Red Sea members of the anti-Saudi ‘‘ Hizb-al-Ahrar-al-Hijazi oi Heiaz Liberal party; while (3) there was no doubt a certain degree of encourage ment from the Yemen, although the astute Imam himself has maintained a studiouslv correct attitude throughout, graced by frequent expressions of Arab sympathy and brotherly advice, dispensed to Ibn Saud by telegraph. Yet, although the Imam Yahya and Ibn Saud furthermore exchanged identic views also by telegraph, on the untrustworthiness of foreigners and their territorial designs thev have watched each other like cat and dog. During the course ot the rebellion, one of the Imam’s sons lay at the head of a large concentration ot Yemeni troops on the northern Yemeni frontier. 364. Jizan was the rebel’s first objective. It fell to the Idrisi on the 6 th November, after only two days’ siege, and the Saudi Governor became his prisoner. Asir was negligently held, the Saudi garrisons being small and unsupported; other centres fell at once to the rebels. On the 17th November, however. Saudi reinforcements, hurried from the Hejaz, retook Jizan. Reinforce ments to the number of about 2,500 passed southward from Jedda both by sea in sanbuqs and a chartered German steamer, and by land in all the lorries which could be mustered. They formed a coastal expeditionary force which, by about the end of December and after what seems to have been considerable fighting, subdued the whole coastal region as far south as the Yemeni border. The Idrisi himself and his remaining adherents were apparently driven into a pocket in the highlands backing on the Yemen. Meanwhile, a second expeditionary force under the Saudi Amir of Khurma, Khalid-bin-Luwey, known for his sacking of Hashimite Taif, had set out southward from that region, gathering t^ihal contingents of camelmen on the way until it was some 5,000 strong. It reached \bha in northern Asir about the 25th November, and after some fighting moved on southward to Sabya. Khalid-bin-Luwey died on the way of illness, said the official communique. He was replaced by his son Naad, while Abdul Aziz-bin- Musaid, Governor of Hail and cousin of the King, was designated Governor- General of the province with headquarters at Abha. A third force, composed of Nejdi Ikhwan under the Amir Khalid-bin-Muhammad, nephew of Ibn Saud, was reported to have set out from Riyadh for Asir and to have started opeiating theie at about the same time as Khalid-bin-Luwey s force, but it has since disappeared from view. It seems possible that it is lying in reserve in case trouble eventuates with the Yemen. . , ^ , 365. Bv early January the Saudi Government seemed to have most ot the situation in hand again. Seyyid Hasan-al-Idrisi was in his retieat in the Asu highlands and had not responded to the Saudi invitation to surrender and receive pardon. The Saudi Government claimed that the majority of his tribesmen, however, had submitted within the period of grace allowed. 366 Ibn Saud sent an envoy to the Imam Yahya in December. The person chosen, one Muhammad-bin-Dhawi, is a subordinate employee in the King’s divan at Riyadh, and seems to be of little personal importance. r-s HI.— Foreign Relations. International. 367. The Saudi Government announced in the local press in November that they had been invited to take part in the World Economic Conference in London. It is not yet known whether they have accepted the invitation, which was not, in any case, conveyed through the British Legation. Great Britain. 368. Relations were neither close nor disturbed to any unusual extent. The Transjordan and Asir situations caused a certain activity, described -in9 Chapter II. The question of emergency landing grounds for aircraft on the Hasa coast was carried a stage forward, as recorded in Chapter IV. Money claims were in no way advanced, save only by the signing of another and pei haps final agreement in November by the Ministry of Finance with the local agents of “ Egyptian Shell ” to pay for the oil stolen by the Saudi Government in 1931. 369. His Majesty’s Minister returned from leave of absence on the 21st December, but was unable to do any business of importance with the Saudi Government before the new year. Italy. 370. The new Italian Minister displayed great interest in the course of events in Asir, and was in heavy telegraphic correspondence with Rome throughout. Italo-Saudi relations were ruffled by an unannounced and unwelcome visit paid by an Italian naval vessel to the Asiri coast in December, while the revolt was in full swing (see paragraph 383). The Netherlands. 371. M. Adriaanse, Charge d’Affaires, returned from leave on the 20th November, bearing yet another letter from Queen Wilhelmina, which he is to deliver personally to the Imam Yahya. This correspondence is beginning to embarrass him. (It may here be noted that, in paragraph 129 of the printed version of the April report, “ from Queen Wilhelmina was a misprint for the original words, “ for Queen Wilhelmina.”) Turkey. 372. A new Charge d’Affaires, Djelal Bey, arrived on the 18th December, but without credentials. He was, nevertheless, received by the Amir Feisal on the 23rd December. He was preceded on the 4th December by the two Turkish artillery officers mentioned in paragraph 315 of the last report, disguised for some obscure reason, and quite ineffectually, as journalists. Their visit is further recorded in paragraph 380. Persia. 373. M. Hoveida also returned from leave on the 18th December, and once again shouldered the task of being Charge d’Affaires. Iraq. 374. Despite the correctness of the relations between Iraq and Saudi Arabia, and the readiness shown last summer in high Saudi circles (see paragraph 269) to acclaim King Feisal as a good neighbour and a sterling Arab, there were indications in November that the King of Iraq, while moie piudent than his brother Abdullah, may continue to be equally hostile to the continuance of Ibn Saud’s rule in the Hejaz. 375. The Iraqi Charge d’Affaires elect having been enrolled in the new Cabinet as Minister of Defence, and none being yet named to Jedda in his stead, the previous Charge d’Affaires’ first secretary, Nasir Bey-el-Gaylam, returned to Jedda on the 6th November as Charge d’Affaires ad interim. One of his first duties was to attempt to safeguard the immovable properties left by the Hashimites in the Hejaz from what appears to be the Saudi decision to confiscate them in punishment of the Sharif Abdullah. Egypt. 376. Hafiz Amer Bey, consul, left Jedda on the 10th November, on what he described as short leave to see his family, but remained absent during the remainder of the year. Saudi Arab Air Force. IV.— Air Matters. 377. The air mission to Angora has not yet materialised (see paragraph 380). Emergency Landing Grounds. 378. The Air Council’s desiderata were received in November for communi cation to the Saudi Arab Government. They concerned British military aircraft [711 o—2] r10 only, and comprised the provision of three emergency landing grounds and seaplane anchorages on the Hasa coast for the use of service aircraft whenever needed, the selection and preparation of the sites in consultation with experts of the Royal Air torce, their maintenance in proper condition by the local authorities under expert advice, their quarterly inspection by Royal Air Force officers, permission for service aircraft to fly along and over' the coast-line, but not inland, at any time, with a view to familiarising pilots with the terrain, permission also for relief machines to use the grounds and anchorages, and, finally^ the conclusion of an agreement embodying these desiderata, valid for five years, and terminable by either Government at six months’ notice thereafter. Prior to addressing the Saudi Government on these lines, His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires raised certain points for His Majesty’s Government’s consideration in connexion with civilian aircraft, particularly those of Imperial Airways flying the Far East route. It was not thought necessary to make provision for' the former, while, as regards the latter, the Air Ministry considered the likelihood of four-engined aircraft, which are flown under a policy of avoiding undue risk, having to land on the Hasa coast as extremely remote. Their desiderata, confined to service aircraft, were therefore conveyed to the Saudi Government in a note dated the 13th December, which added that, in the improbable event of any 41 Imperial Airways machine having to make a forced landing. His Majestv’s Government relied on the humane Saudi Arab Government to secure its safety. A erial Trespass. 379. On the 5th December the Saudi Government protested against the flight of a British aeroplane over Jubail on the Hasa coast on the 27th November. It was eventually established that an Imperial Airways machine, obliged to fly by night, had lost its way and flown over Jubail to get bearings. Regret has been expressed to the Saudi Arab Government, who have been informed that Imperial Airways were being warned scrupulously to avoid living over Saudi territory. Military Mission. ^' ^ 1L11ARY Matters. 380. The arrival of the two 1 urkish military officers foreshadowed in paragraph 315 of the last report has been noted in paragraph 372. It is not yet definitely known whether delivery of the 100 rifles and two mitrailleuses was made at the same time. The Saudi military and air mission to Angora for instructional purposes has not yet been finally formed. It is learned that the two Turkish artillerymen, besides expressing disappointment at the lack of facilities given them to inspect the old Ottoman pieces in the Hejaz. also expressed surprise that the mission would consist of only ten to fifteen students They seem to have expected fifty. It is believed that the Turkish Government are, furthermore, prepared to meet all expenses, other than the cost of the join ney ne\ei theless, there seems to be a hitch somewhere, for the mission is materialising unaccountably slowly. It may be because of an uneasy feeling that Wahhabi youth will be corrupted in Allah jess Turkey. General. 381. Measures to crush the revolt in Asir and a supposed concentration of Ikhwan northward in the direction of Transjordan have been reported in chapter II. British. VI.— Naval Matters. 382. No visits were paid by His Majesty’s ships to Saudi ports during November and December. On the 17th November, H.M.S. Hastinqs Captain C. S. Sandford) altered programme to visit Kamaran to get a somewhat closer view of the troubles in Asir, but to avoid the Farsan Islands which lie off the Asiri coast. F oreign. 383. I he Italian navy was less tactful. Either on instructions from Rome or Asmara, or on the commander’s initiative, one of the coastguard vessels stationed in Eritrean waters visited Jizan on the 21st December without the formality of previous warning and in the middle of the Asir revolt. After11 causing some local stir and being in effect warned off by the local Saudi officials, the vessel proceeded to Farsan and thence down the coast to another Asiri “ port,” Madhaya. Mecca was indignant and registered strong protests with the Italian representative in Jedda. M. de Peppo explained that, as the Saudi Government themselves had left everyone so much in the dark about the true course of events in Asir, the Italian authorities had had to probe matters for themselves, in the interests of their trading community in Eritrea, which was heavily hit by the unrest in Asir. The Italian Government are said to have admitted a breach in the international practice governing naval visits, but they assured the Saudi Government of the Italian Government’s entirely friendly feelings. Anyhow, the explanations offered sufficed to end the incident. Indian. VII.— Pilgrimage. 384. During November the Legation was required to supply the Government of India with material for reply to a number of questions asked in the Legislative Assembly regarding conditions of the approaching pilgrimage to Mecca. The Government of India published on the 26th November the tentative estimate of the cost of this pilgrimage prepared by the Legation. There has so far been no sign of a repetition of last season’s controversy as to costs (see paragraph 95), the nearest approach being some slightly misleading press statements made in India by Jamal Pasha-al-Ghazzi, who styled himself Saudi Minister for War until called to order by the Saudi Government. He has now let the Indian press know that he is a private individual, but in reality he and Ismail Ghuznavi, the agitator, are paid propagandists of the Saudi Government. The former is also receiving Rs. 500 (€37 10*.) a month from Messrs. Turner. Morrison and Co., who hold an effectual monopoly of the Indian pilgrim trade, to boost the pilgrimage for them. M anumissions. VIII.— Slavery. ^ 385. One Sudani male slave, who had taken refuge in October, and one Sudani male and two Sudani female slaves, who took refuge in November ami December, were freed and repatriated during this period. Two Abyssinian male slaves took refuge at the end of December. Enslavement of Pilgrims. 386. The suspected case reported in paragraph 332 was, after investigation by the Saudi Government, found to be not proven. The Legation referred the results of the enquiry to Lagos for such check thereon as might be possible. Deportations. Miscellaneous. 389. Mirza Suleiman Ahmed (paragraph 109) was at length permitted to 1 etui n aftei an expiation of nearly a year in exile. A Nigerian, employed for long years jointly by the Legation and Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey, albeit in one of the meanest of tasks, was sentenced by the Sharia Court in November to deporta tion for distilling alcoholic liquor. In view of his joint allegiance he could not be afforded Legation protection, but he was enabled to leave in the guise of a free man and with some hope of return. Staff. 390.

JANUARY coincided almost exactly with the fast of Ramadan and the ensuing festival—times of slackness. Ibn Saud remained at Riyadh. The anniversary of his accession was celebrated on the 8th January, but only in Jedda, where his son, the Viceroy, held receptions and presided at a dinner at which the members of the Diplomatic Body were the principal guests. luad Bev Hamza did not attend. He paid three short visits to Jedda and had long conversations with Sir Andrew Ryan on the 5th and 9th January. After that personal diplomatic discussion languished rather, but luad Bey dined at the Legation on the 13th January to meet Sir George Buchanan and the Senior Naval Officer. Red Sea Sloops, and’ gave a return dinner next evening. 2. There was no improvement in the financial situation. On the 15th January Abdul Hamid Bey Shadid, an emissary of the ex-Khedive, arrived in Jedda. It was understood that he would follow up negotiations begun last May regarding a scheme which turns on the creation of a National Bank with privilege of issues, financial assistance to the Saudi Government and economic concessions to be given to the ex-Khedive. 3. The Saudi forces at Sabya and Jizan, having swept down the coast nearly to the Yemen frontier at the end of December, occupied Abu Arish and other places in the interior in the first days of January. The Government claimed that the rebellion was effectively at an end. though it was admitted that certain tribal elements were still in revolt in the mountains adjoining the Yemen and that the Idrisi had escaped. It is probable that the position in the highlands was less rosy than the Saudi authorities represented it to be, but the situation there remained obscure during the rest of the month. The King’s relative, Abdul Aziz-bin-Musaid, formerly Governor of Hail, has assumed the command at Jizan. The earlier history of the revolt is given in the report for November-December 1932, paragraphs 363 ff. [m ee-2] f EN clOSURE IN WttKLY LETTER No 20 18 MAY, 1M5 FROM secretary, POLm^LANO SECRET DEPT. INDIA OFFICE■naHMOT 2 II. —Frontier Questions and Foreign Relations in Arabia. 4 . On the 11th January Sir Andrew Ryan conveyed, in a note to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the ' definite proposals of His Majesty’s Government regarding the procedure for mutual recognition between Transjordan and feaudi Arabia and subsequent negotiations for a bilateral treaty, for the execution of which by Transjordan His Majesty s Government in the United Kingdom would be expressly responsible. The Saudi Government s reply of the 22nd January was reasonably satisfactory, but not altogether precise except on the one point that Ibn Saud’s assent was inspired entirely by reliance on the guarantee of His Majesty’s Government. British apprehensions regarding a reported concentra tion of Ikhwan near the frontier were allayed early in the month. Ibn Saud admitted that he had taken certain measures earlier owing to rumours of possible incursions from Transjordan, but stated, with apparent truth, that there was no longer any sort of concentration. Mutual assurances of non-aggressive intentions were exchanged. _ r-O 5. Full information was received from the Iraqi Legation during the month regarding the negotiations for a motor route for pilgrims from Nejef to Medina. The Iraqi and Saudi Governments have agreed in principle on the trace and all other points except one, i.e., whether there should be permanent buildings to house administrative services on the frontier post. The Iraqi Government are keen on this. The Saudis strongly oppose it and think that tents would do. Even when the agreement is complete, an elaborate survey will be necessary. There is no prospect of the route being opened this year, incidentally, Indian interests have, of late, busied themselves a good deal with the idea of overland motor transport from India to the Hejaz via Iraq. 6 . The situation on the Asir-Yemen frontier threatened to complicate relations between Ibn Saud and the Imam, owing to the proximity of Saudi forces and rebels to the frontier and the presence of Yemeni forces south of Midi. The relations of the two rulers remained correct, and continued to be represented as cordial, throughout January. The representative sent by Ibn Saud direct from Riyadh to Sana some weeks ago left Sana early in January and was said to be the bearer of a new draft treaty. III.— Relations with Powers outside Arabia. 7. Relations between the Saudi and British Governments remained friendly. They turned principally on Transjordan affairs, including the embarrassing question of the alleged complicity of members of the Amir Abdullah’s entourage in plots against Ibn Saud. Although the measures taken in various directions under the auspices of His Majesty’s Government to restrict the activities of members of the Dabbagh conspiracy were strengthened, it is more difficult to deal with persons in the Amir's service who are accused by the Saudi Government, like his cousin, the Amir Shakir, and his chamberlain, Hamid Pasha-al-Wadi. 8 . The incident between the Saudi and Italian Governments over the proceedings of an Italian sloop in Asir waters towards the end of December was closed at the beginning of January by Ibn Sand's acceptance of explanations and perhaps semi-apologies tendered by the Italian Government. IV.—Miscellaneous. 9. H.M.S. Hastings, Captain Sandford, Senior Naval Officer, Red Sea Sloops, visited Jedda from the 13th to the 15th January. She brought and took away Sir George Buchanan, the principal medical officer of the Ministry of Health. He stayed as a private guest at the Legation, but the Saudi authorities were very ready to show T him attention. They did not venture to exhibit their local hospital, but the Director-General of Public Health conducted Sir George personally to see the water installation at the Waziriya Wells, 10 miles from Jedda, where there is an American windmill, erected by Mr. Twitched, and a small experimental garden; to the private house of a Javanese sheikh of pilgrims, which was got up as a sample of accommodation for pilgrims; and to the quaran tine islands outside Jedda.10 . The pilgrimage is still expected to be poor. One ship from India arrived on the 11th January bringing 1,561 pilgrims, of whom 175 were Indian, the remainder mostly Afghan. 11 . The position in regard to the manumission of slaves was as follows:— On hand at the beginning of the month : Two males. Took refuge in January : Nil. Manumitted and repatriated : Two males (to Abyssinia). Locally manumitted : Nil. On hand at the end of the month : Nil. 12. Distribution List .—Copies sent to— The High Commissioner, Cairo.

(Confidential.) , 13. The King remained at Riyadh throughout the month. He is expected to return to Mecca about the middle of March, about three weeks befoie Pilgrimage Hay, which should fall on or about the 4th April. 14. The Amir Feisal visited Jedda from the 7th to the 9th February. Besides receiving Sir Andrew Ryan and Mr. Hope Gill (see paragraph 23), he visited the local hospital, the reconditioning of which was foreshadowed in January, and presented £100 to it. . 15. There was marked activity in February in connexion with financial and economic schemes for the betterment of Saudi Arabia. The following were the principal developments— {a) Abdul Hamid Shedid, the ex-Khedive’s agent (paragraph 2), seems to have made considerable progress with negotiations for the creation of a national bank, with a capital of £1 million gold, to be subscribed as to one-half by the ex-Khedive. It is understood that the Saudi Government will have the option of subscribing £250,000, but that, in the almost certain event of their not doing so, the promoters have another source in view. The remaining £250,000 will be offered for subscription in the Hejaz. The bank will serve as State bank, and receive all revenue on deposit. A loan of £200,000 is to be made to the Saudi Government. The bank will have the privilege of issuing notes, but it is not clear that their use will be made compulsory at the outset. It is not known what, if any, economic concessions have been promised to the ex-Khedive and his associates. The financial basis and prospects on which they are working are obscure; the possible political motives of Abbas Hilmi Pasha even more so. (5) Dr. S. A. K. Jeelani of Madras left for India on the 24th February, after concluding laborious negotiations for a fifty years’ concession to build and exploit a railway between Mecca and Jedda. The Government secured very favourable terms, including a 50 per cent, share in gross receipts and a loan of 10 lakhs of rupees, repayable in annual instalments. It seemed probable that Dr. Jeelani had moral support in India, but had still to get the definite financial backing required. The scheme is almost certainly unsound as a practical economic proposition, but may nevertheless find support on religious grounds. {c) The American, Mr. Twitched, who conducted extensive surveys for the Saudi Government in 1931-32, returned to Jedda on the 15th February, with a Mr. Hamilton, who represents the Standard Oil Company of California. He no longer serves the Saudi Government, but has interested American concerns in the [739 x—1]2 mineral possibilities of Saudi Arabia, notably oil on the Hasa Coast, and perhaps in the Wejh area, and gold, which has been located at various places, notably near Medina. Standard Oil of California seem to be the likeliest competitors for the oil, although the Iraq Petroleum Company and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company have also shown some interest. Mr. Twitched himself appears to be acting for the parties interested in the gold. (d) It is understood that Ibn Saud signified approval in January of the textile scheme mentioned in paragraph 341 of last year’s reports, provided it were charitable. (e) There has been vague talk of financial assistance for Ibn Saud from the Nizam of Hyderabad in consideration of the Nizam’s being allowed to recondition the Prophet’s birthplace at Mecca. Nothing definite is known on this subject. 16. On the 2nd February, Fuad Bey Hamza told Sir Andrew Ryan that the King’s cousin, Ibn Musaid, who left Hail some time ago to take charge in Asir, had assumed command at Jizan, but that there was no longer a fighting front. He said that the two principal tribal elements still in revolt, viz., the Masariha and part of the Beni Shubeyl, had surrendered, and that another in the mountains had been reduced. The Idrisi was understood to have crossed the frontier into the Yemen, attended only by a few personal adherents. Although the Saudi claim to have suppressed the rebellion completely may be exaggerated, it is probably true that any serious danger has been averted, unless there should be a later recrudescence. A Saudi communique, published on the 24th February, represented the situation in Asir as having been completely stabilised. In the absence of any other material information from Asir during the month, the main subject of interest was the possible repercussions of the Idrisi’s escape on relations between Saudi Arabia and the Yemen (see paragraph 22). Chapter II .—Frontier Questions and Foreign Relations in Arabia. 17. His Majesty’s Minister left for Jerusalem on the 10th February; arrived there on the 15th February, after a flying visit to Cairo; and returned to Jedda on the 26th February. The object of this journey was to pave the way, in consultation with the High Commissioner, for further discussions with the Saudi Government regarding various aspects of the relations between Saudi Arabia and Transjordan. After preliminary discussions in Jerusalem, Sir Andrew Ryan proceeded to Amman on the 16th February. He and Colonel Cox lunched that day with the Amir Abdullah, who, in general discussion of a private nature, reaffirmed his willingness to comply in every respect with the wishes of His Majesty’s Government regarding his relations with Ibn Saud. The Amir dwelt on certain of the desiderata, which he had expressed when he agreed last autumn to recognise Ibn Saud. 18. The principal results of Sir Andrew Ryan’s discussions in Jerusalem and Amman, and of an interview between General Wauchope and the Amir Abdullah, on the 19th February, were as follows :— (a) Drafts in English and in Arabic, which will be the language of the official texts, were prepared of the communication to be addressed by the Amir’s chief Minister to the High Commissioner regarding mutual recognition, and of a telegram to be sent by the Amir to Ibn Saud after the completion of the recognition. The Amir accepted the drafts, and His Majesty’s Government approved of them in due course, subject to slight verbal alterations. (b) It was contemplated, subject to the final approval of His Majesty’s Government, that the ensuing negotiations for treaties between Saudi Arabia and Transjordan, on the general lines of those concluded in 1931 between Saudi Arabia and Iraq, should if possible be divided into two stages, the first at Jedda in the second half of April, the second at Jerusalem about the middle of June. (c) Tentative drafts of the proposed treaties were prepared at Amman, for submission to higher authority. 19. Among the other subjects discussed were the nature of the Trans jordanian representation in the forthcoming negotiations, a suggestion thrown out by the Saudi Minister in London (in circumstances which left its ultimate origin doubtful) that a personal meeting between Ibn Saud and theAmir Abdullah might be useful, and the possibility of further measures to restrain anti-Saudi activities in Transjordan and other countries under British control or influence. Preliminary conclusions were reached on these subjects. It is unnecessary to describe them in detail, as, though important, they are subsidiary to the main purpose. 20. It remains to pursue the above matters in suitable order, beginning with mutual recognition, with the Saudi Government. 21. According to an article in the Umm-al-Qura of the 17th February, Ibn Saud’s envoy to the Imam Yahya had then got back with the Imam’s reply to a letter which he had delivered on behalf of Ibn Saud. The reply, as reproduced, probably only in part, in the article, is friendly, pious and vague. It, however, intimates acceptance of “ four points ” stated by the King, subject to details added by the Imam, who is said to have asked Ibn Saud to send authorised delegates to conclude a final agreement. 22. This letter from the Imam must have been written about the beginning of the year. Subsequently, the escape of the Idrisi into the Yemen (see paragraph 16) created a more acute situation. Fuad Bey told Sir Andrew Ryan, on the 2nd February, that there was danger of complications unless the Imam surrendered the Idrisi, as he was bound to do under the treaty concluded in December 1931. Sir Andrew Ryan suggested that, as the Idrisi was stated to have no serious following, the matter should be dealt with as a simple question of extradition, not as a possible cause of conflict. On the 9th February, Fuad Bey said that the King had reached the same conclusion, and that the Imam had now agreed to surrender the Idrisi subject to his being pardoned and well treated, a request to which the King acceded. Secret reports about the same time suggested that the real situation between the King and the Imam was much more strained. Fuad Bey’s version was restated in an amplified form (according to which the King had promised amnesty to all the fugitives in the Yemen), in the official Saudi communique of the 24th February, but'there was no news up to the end of the month of the actual surrender of the* rebels. Chapter III .—Relations with Powers outside Arabia. 23. Sir Andrew Ryan had friendly conversations with Fuad Bey Hamza on the 2nd February, mainly about Transjordan questions and the Asir Yemen situation (paragraphs 16 and 22). The Amir Feisal came to Jedda on the 7th February. It was currently, though probably falsely, believed that he had come to see the Minister before his departure for Jerusalem. The Prince received him and Mr. Hope Gill very amiably, but seemed listless. 24. Considerable emotion was caused in the latter part of the month by a report that the Soviet Minister had at last brought off an agreement with the Saudi Government, and secured a partial or total removal of the embargo on diiect trade from Russia, using as a lever the claim of the Soviet for payment for some £30,000 worth of benzine and petroleum supplied under a special contract towards the end of 1931. It was understood that the claim would be met by a partial or total remission of duty on goods to be imported from Russia for sale on the Hejazi market. Nothing further could be ascertained up to the end of the month, but it was generally believed that the deal had been completed. It Russian goods come freely into the Hejaz, it will dislocate the trade from other supplying countries, e.g., Australia, which has done a tidy business in flour, and India, which has normally, though of late in a decreasing measure, supplied many Hejazi requirements. The articles most spoken of are flour, sugar and matches. It is doubtful whether Russia can establish a grip of the market for petroleum products, in view of the commitments of the Saudi Government to other interests, including Shell. 25 ; There is little else worth recording under this head. The Netherlands Charge d Affaires left for l^ana on the 14th February to deliver a letter from Queen Wilhelmina to the Imam. The French * Charge d’Affaires left unexpectedly, seemingly for Syria, on the 24th February, the reasons beino- unknown. There was no obvious deterioration of relations between the Saudi Government and Italy, despite the suspicion bred in Ibn Saud’s mind by the Italians affection for the Imam and the tolerance shown to anti-Saudi conspirators m Eritrea.4 Chapter IV.— Miscellaneous. 26. The French sloop Diana, with Vice-Admiral Jubert on board, visited Jedda on the 31st January and left on the 2nd February. 27. Lady Evelyn Cobbold, a rich and well-connected widow of 65, a mighty huntress, and a Moslem since the age of 8, though a pretty lax one, arrived in Jedda on the 26th February to stay with Mr. and Mrs. Philby. She apparently left London with some hope of being received by Ibn Baud, and also with some idea of visiting Mecca. She is not likely to achieve the former object, but may get to Mecca. 28. The Saudi wireless station at Qunfida has been transferred to Lith, and has been replaced by an installation working on a wave-length of 1,100 metres. 29. The efforts of the Legation to interest the Saudi Government in combating locusts (paragraph 347 of last year’s reports) bore further fruit on the 17th February, when an undated but apparently recent report on locusts seen at Wejh was forwarded to the Legation, giving details somewhat on the lines of those asked for and accompanied by two tins of very neatly packed specimens. 30. The principal arrivals of pilgrims in February were as follows 3,979 from Bombay and Karachi, of whom 2,638 were British Indians; 314 from Batavia and Singapore, of whom 101 were British Malayans; and 108 from Tangier, all Moors; a total of 4,401 pilgrims. 31. The position in regard to the manumission of slaves was as follows :— On hand at the beginning of the month : Nil. Took refuge in February : 2 males, 1 female. Manumitted and repatriated : 1 male. Locally manumitted : Nil. On hand at the end of the month : 1 male, 1 female. oTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT EASTERN (Arabia). CONFIDENTIAL.

Enclosure in No. 1. Jedda Report for Marc h 1933. I.—Internal Affairs. 32. THE King, who had gone into camp at Rawdat-al-Khafs, a place some distance from Riyadh and reported to be delightful, mingled sport with business until mid-March. He returned to Riyadh on or about the 19th March and left on the 21st March. He arrived in Mecca for the pilgrimage on the 27th March, bringing numerous members of his family and other attendants. He gave his annual dinner to notable pilgrims on the evening of the 31st March. Little has been heard of him in Jedda since his return. 33. The Amir Feisal was in Jedda from the 8th to the 11th March. He held no reception, but went to tea with Mr. and Mrs. Philby on the 10th March, where he met a select party consisting principally of Sir Andrew and Lady Ryan, the American concession hunters and their wives, and Lady Evelyn Cobbold. The tea-party was alafranga, the Prince most affable to both sexes. Fuad Bey Hamza has kept fairly regularly to his new plan of being at the Jedda branch of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs on Saturdays. 34. There have been various developments in connexion with the financial and economic schemes mentioned in the last report (see paragraph 15). They may be summed up as follows :— {a) The ex-Khedive’s agent completed his negotiations early in March and left Jedda on the 10th March, taking with him, it appears, the National Bank Concession, in spite of an eleventh-hour attempt to scotch it on the part of the young Syrian merchant, Hussein Aweyni, who went on behalf of himself and others to Riyadh. Both parties to the concession state that the agreement is definite, but no details have been made public. The particulars given in paragraph 15 (a) are believed to be accurate. The notes are not to be forced currency and are to have substantial gold cover. The bank is apparently not to be for the Hejaz only, but will operate in other Near Eastern countries and will have its headquarters in London. It is rumoured in diplomatic circles that Mr. Philby will be the conseiller. The motives of the promoters continue to be obscure. The “ Amir ” Habib Lutfullah, who obtained a similar concession from King Hussein just eight years ago, had at least the satisfaction of having been made Ambassador in Rome and playing a miscellaneous diplomatic role. (5) The Umm-al-Qura of the 3rd March published a summary of the Jeelani concession for the proposed railway between Mecca and Jedda. The forecast in paragraph 15 (b) was not completely accurate. The loan of 10 lacs is to be paid in five monthly instalments, beginning in October 1933, and to be repayable by retention of 5 per cent, of the Government’s share of the receipts. The loan will apparently be a charge on the capital of 50 lacs. The construction of the line is to. [795 c—1] NCI No. 24 15 JUN, 1933 j FROM SECRETARY, L SECRET DEPT. PQU ICaL AND 1 INDIA OFFICE•2 begin in October-November 1933 and to be completed in September 1935, subject to a possible extension of time to a date not later than the 23rd March, 1936, in case of delay due to force majeure. The summary gives no particulars of the agreed apportionment of gross receipts or the fares to be charged. {c) There are now two sets of representatives negotiating for oil rights in Hasa, namely, Messrs. Twitched and Hamilton, representing Standard Oil of California as before, and Messrs. Longrigg and Muderris, who arrived in Jedda on the 12th March, on behalf of the Iraq Petroleum Company. The Minister of Finance is said to have stood out for £100.000 down and a substantial periodical payment afterwards. Neither candidate has been prepared to accept his terms, but Standard Oil of California are believed to be readier than the Iraq Petroleum Company has so far shown itself to accept the principle of a substantial payment for a pig in a poke rather than a moderate rental in the first instance for prospecting rights only. Mr. Hamilton-went to Cairo at short notice on the 23rd March, presumably to consult other parties, including, possibly, Major Holmes and another person connected with the Eastern and General Syndicate, who were about to fly from Koweit to Egypt about the same time. It was reported from Koweit that Major Holmes had been invited by Ibn Sand to come to Jedda, a surprising development, if true, as Major Holmes is known to have been in the King’s black books for some years. Messrs. Longrigg and Muderris are playing a patient game, but the former went to Port Sudan for a few days on the 26th March to escape boredom and “ to buy a topee.” (d) The scheme hatched by Hyderabad notables to start a textile industry in the Hejaz seems to have made progress at the Indian end. *A certain amount of money, variously put at from 5,000 to 15,000 rupees, has been collected, and' looms and spinning-wheels are said to have been ordered in India. (e) Nothing more has been heard of financial help for Saudi Arabia from the Nizam of Hyderabad. 35 . The financial and economic developments described above have generated a new feeling of optimism in the Hejaz. Even the Saudi Government have been showing greater readiness to pay out money in respect of minor obligations. 36. There has been no news of further internal commotion in Asir or elsewhere. Notwithstanding this, Ibn Saud has presented an appearance of nervousness, possibly owing to the situation vis-a-vis of the Yemen (see para graph 42 below) and uncertainty as to the strength of his hold on the country as a whole. He may be still suffering from the jolt given him by the Ibn Rifada and Asir rebellions last year, despite his success in represssing them. IX.—Frontier Questions and Foreign Relations in Arabia. 37. Progress was made in March with the arrangements for mutual recognition between Ibn Saud and the Amir of Transjordan. The Trans jordanian and Saudi notes to the High Commissioner for Transjordan and His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda respectively were duly written on the 21st March. Though neither followed the exact wording proposed in February, they were similar in substance and were satisfactory. Special arrangements were made to forward certified copies speedily to the Legation and the High Commissioner for transmission to the respective Governments of the other part. All was ready by the 30th March, and it was proposed in Jedda to make the communications necessary to consummate recognition on the 31st March. Although Wahhabis have no objection to Friday diplomacy, that day of the week was considered unsuitable in Jerusalem, and the communication was postponed at both ends until the 1st April. A bsit omen. 38. The completion of the recognition procedure paves the way for treaty negotiations. Ibn Saud demurred to the two-stage proposal mentioned in paragraph 18 (b), but it was hoped at the end of March to get him to agree to a second stage at Jerusalem, in the almost certain event of its being impossible to reach agreement during the stay of the Transjordan delegates in Jedda, which will necessarily be short.39. On the 19th March, Sir Andrew Ryan sent Fuad Bey a personal and confidential letter containing a systematic statement regarding measures taken by His Majesty’s Government to counteract anti-Saudi machinations in countries under their control or influence. Fuad Bey's reply was warmly appreciative. 40. There was no trouble on the Transjordan frontier in March, but the projected meeting between Captain Glubb and Sheikh Abdul Aziz-ibn-Zeyd again did not come off. Some correspondence passed regarding the recent conduct of the Governor of Tabuk in collecting “commission on loot,' i.e., retaining a heavy percentage of returnable camels. The Saudi Government sent to the Legation on the 14th February a revised version of an earlier and very cavalier answer to a protest regarding intrusions into Transjordan by Saudi officials and soldiers last autumn. Fuad Bey had asked for the return of the first note in deference to representations as to the unfavourable impression it would create. The revised version, though still unsatisfactory, was a great improvement on the first. 41. The Iraqi representative in Jedda has not been happy, less apparently because of any really serious trouble between Iraq and Saudi Arabia than because his Government press him to attempt the solution of too many questions simul taneously. The scheme for a motor route for pilgrims between Nejef and Medina makes slow progress. The Iraqi Government are also keen on a settlement of the vexed question of property owned by the Hashimite family in the Hejaz, a subject which may perhaps engage attention during the projected negotiations between Saudi Arabia and Transjordan. 42. The arrangements for the surrender of the Idrisi to Ibn Saud (para graphs 21 and 22 of last report) hung fire throughout the month. There has been much reticence on the subject, but there have been no other overt signs of tension between King and Imam. III.— Relations with Powers outside Arabia. 43. Relations between His Majesty's Minister and the Saudi Government, i.e., Fuad Bey Hamza, were sweeter than sugar throughout the month. The main subject of discussion was the Saudi-Transjordan recognition formulae. Ibn Saud has been accommodating to an extent wffiich affords a further indication of the nervousness mentioned in paragraph 36 above. On the 4th March a local policeman entered the Legation offices in circumstances which necessitated a protest on grounds of violation. After an unsuccessful effort to get an adequate apology from the Governor of Jedda suitable satisfaction was obtained from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. Ibn Saud gave a proof of goodwill in March by authorising the return to Jedda of a man, partly in the Legation service, who had been deported last year in consequence of a charge of having made an alcoholic beverage. 44. Fuad Bey gave Sir Andrew Ryan on the 18th March a general account of the position between Soviet Russia and Saudi Arabia since 1931. He stated that no general agreements had been reached on the lines described by the Soviets, but admitted that the Saudi Government had removed the embargo on trade from Russia, subject to its not being started pending the elaboration of machinery for the marketing of Russian goods. 45. The Netherlands Charge d'Affaires (see paragraph 23) returned from Sana in the last days of March. The French Charge d'Affaires returned rather earlier, stating, not unplausibly, that he had only gone to Syria to have a permanently-damaged eye seen to. 46. The Afghan Minister for Foreign Affairs arrived in Jedda on pilgrimage on the 6th March and went on a day or two later to Medina. He is understood to be on leave and it is not known whether he had brought the instrument of ratification of the Saudi Afghan Treaty of May 1932. IV.— Miscellaneous. 47. H.M.S. Penzance visited the Farzan Islands on the 22nd-24th March. Owing to a misapprehension in Jedda as to the instruction of His Majesty's Government, the visit was not notified to the Saudi Government by the Legation, with the result that the local sheikhs and Amir, though very polite, demurred to the visit, as not having been authorised by their superior authorities.4 48. Seyyid Ahmed-as-Senusi died at Medina on the 10th March. The disappearance of this once considerable figure attracted little attention. 49. Mr. C. G. Hope Gill, the senior member of the Legation staff, left Jedda for good on the 15th March, on transfer to Alexandria. He had been here since the 3rd January, 1930, and had acted no less than five terms as His Majesty’s Charge d'Affaires. His successor, Mr. A. S. Calvert, is expected in the latter part of April. 50. Lady Evelyn Cobbold (see paragraph 27) has been more successful than was anticipated and a little more successful than she desired, having obtained permission to visit the Holy Cities but having been given to understand that it would be mal vue if, being here so close to pilgrimage time, she did not go the whole hog and do the pilgrimage proper, instead of merely making the visit known as Omra. Her success has been attributed less to evidence of piety or even to the Dunmore lineage than to the discovery that her son-in-law. Mr. Hambro, was a director of the Bank of England. Anyhow, she went to Medina on the 20th March and started for Mecca on the 30th March. If Ibn Baud receives her, her cup of blessings will be full to overflowing. 51. Further arrivals of pilgrims in March brought the total number from Indian ports up to about 10,500, of whom some 7,000 are British India subjects. The total of overseas pilgrims may be in the neighbourhood of 24,000. In the absence of the India and Malay pilgrimage officers at Mecca, accurate estimates cannot at the moment be given. There have again been a good many pilgrims of important standing, including one picturesque figure, the Amir of Katsina, a personage of great wealth and consideration in Nigeria. Mecca will not enjoy the presence of the well-known Indian agitator, Ismail Ghuznavi, of Amritsar, to whom the Indian Government refused facilities. He is important at the Saudi end, as being an ardent Wahhabi whom Ibn Baud has used greatly as a sort of unofficial agent in India. 52. The position in regard to the manumission of slaves was as follows : — On hand at the beginning of the month : 1 male, 1 female. Took refuge in March : None. Manumitted in March and repatriated : 1 male. Locally manumitted : 1 female. On hand at the end of the month : None. f&gt;confidential* No. F.81-N/33.

Ibn Saud was in Mecca, busy with the pilgrimage, from the 1st April until early on the 15th April, when he came to Jedda. He stayed until the 20th April at the Khuzam Palace at Nuzla, a mile outside the town. This is a new house just built by Abdullah Suleyman, who already had a bungalow near by, ostensibly for his own use. It is not clear whether he retains rights in it, but it appears to have now definitely become the Royal residence in Jedda. It is a house of some pretension, having at least two fine rooms and a good terrace roof, but in its present hardly completed state it produces the effect of poor workman ship in details. It is in open surroundings commanding a good distant view of the sea and is well placed as regards climate conditions, but it is infested with flies and the approach from the town is bad. 54. The King received the foreign representatives in a series of formal audiences on the morning of his arrival. The subsequent business audiences included one given to Sir Andrew Ryan on the 17th April, when a general discussion took place in connexion with the impending Saudi-Transjordan negotiations. Sir Andrew Ryan, wishing to prepare the King for the probability of a necessary division of the negotiations into two stages, emphasised the difficulty of certain questions which would arise. The King made light of difficulties. He suggested that, as the Transjordan delegates proper would have the backing of a British representative in Transjordan, the Minister in Jedda should back his own delegates. 55. Ibn Saud appeared to be in good health, but he seemed tired and preoccupied during his audiences. 56. The King’s speech at his pilgrimage banquet on the 31st March, as reported (it is believed fairly accurately) in the Umm-cd-Qura of the 6th April, abounded in the usual pious texts and exhortations to Islamic unity, but he was more careful than on some previous occasions to avoid language likely to give offence to Moslems of non-Wahhabi convictions. Speaking with reference to the idea that he might aspire to the Caliphate over all Islam, he disclaimed any such pretension on the ground that a Caliph must be able to enforce the commands of the Islamic religion over the whole Islamic world, a thing which no man living at the present time was in a position to do. 57. The Amir Feisal came to Jedda on the 24th April. He received the Transjordan mission that morning and gave a large dinner-party stark with Jedda [795 gg^t] bnotables, in their honour that evening. He dined next evening at the British Legation. He took no other overt part in the affairs of the mission and returned to Mecca on the 27th April. 58. There has been a lull in the various activities directed towards economic development. The following summary shows the position during the month in regard to the projects, &amp;c., mentioned in the two previous reports, paragraphs 15 and 34 :—• (a) Nothing more was heard of the progress of the arrangements to give effect to the National Bank concession. AW may be well, but the silence of the ex-Khedive’s agent has created some little doubt in high Saudi circles. (b) A still deeper silence has brooded over the Mecca-Jedda railway project. (c) The negotiations for an oil concession in Hasa had still produced no definite result by the 30th April. The representatives of the Iraq Petroleum Company remained in Jedda throughout the month, but did not seem to make any headway. Mr. Hamilton, of Standard Oil of California, returned from a conference with colleagues in Egypt on the 9th April, and has probably made progress towards an agreement on lines similar to. but not so favourable to the Government as, those for which the Minister of Finance was standing out. Major Holmes, of the Eastern and General Syndicate, arrived in the same steamer as Mr. Hamilton. It appears to be true that he came by invitation of the Saudi Government in the sense that he had himself elicited the invi tation and had been given it in the hope of enlarging the field of competition. He left precipitately on the 12th April having seen the Minister of Finance, but not the King. The extensive and peculiar nature of his interests probably proved an embarrassment to him. As a moving spirit in the Eastern and General Syndicate he is a rover in the world of oil, but in Bahrein he is tied to Standard Oil of California and he is co-interested in Koweit with a separate American concern belonging to the Mellon group, viz., the Eastern Gulf Oil Company. He seems to have come to Jedda with only one avowed object, that of getting Ibn Saud’s consent, so far as the Saudi Government are concerned, to a concession in the Koweit neutral zone. He had promised Standard Oil of California not to poach on their preserves in Hasa, but would appear to have had ideas of his own, nevertheless, as to how that field might ultimately be partitioned. It seems fairly certain that he left Jedda with two fleas in his ear. one inserted by the Minister of Finance, the other by Mr. Hamilton. (d) The Hyderabad textile industry scheme has not so far produced visible results at the Hejazi end, nor has anything more been heard of financial help from the Nizam. 59. A communique published on the 8th April announced that hence forward motor vehicles of one type only, not specified, would be allowed to be imported into the Hejaz. There is a close connexion between this and a scheme for standardising all motor transport and giving a monopoly of import to a single person or firm. The hottest competitor for this monopoly is Mr. Philby, who by the end of the month thought he had as good as got it. Stripped of various details the plan is that Mr. Philby or his company should import Ford cars only, to be sold to the Government on credit terms, secured on a fixed share in the receipts of the Naqaba, i.e., the existing Government organisation in charge of the arrangements for transporting pilgrims. The monopoly would include a mono poly for the importation of tyres, not confined to one make, and perhaps other accessories. If he gets it Mr. Philby will have to find capital to finance the purchases from the Ford Company, who have become very shy of themselves selling cars on credit in this country. 60. The Saudi Government have at last taken final delivery of the wireless stations supplied by the Marconi Company. The last remaining station, that at Riyadh, was completed some time ago, but the authorities were very dilatory in facing up to an acknowledgment that the company had fulfilled all their obligations. 61. There was no definite news of further trouble in Asir in April, although there were rumours in Jedda and Mecca that the Government were anxious. It3 seems to be true that further troops were sent to Asir, but these may have merely gone t° relieve others. It is intended, following on the arrangement regarding n ^ if- 1 T ? COrded in P ai a g ra P^ below, to organise the part of Asir in which he had his being as an ordinary Saudi province to be called Asir Tihama, with a local Governor under a Governor-General or Viceroy at Abha. d of Police at Jedda was retransferred to his former post at Kabigh m April and was replaced by one Khalil Bey, Director of Police at Medina, who had held the post at Jedda two years previously. The removal of the late director may have been partly due to the affair mentioned in paragraph \ °l t i he J last Te P 0Tt and certain other grievances of the Legation against him, which had not given rise to official action when they occurred, but were ventilated m connexion with the incident of the 4th March. The new man is known to the Legation and not unfavourably. II.—F rentier Questions and Foreign Relations in Arabia. 63. The arrangements for the mutual recognition of each other by Ibn Saud and the Amir Abdullah were completed according to plan on the 1st April. The two rulers exchanged friendly telegrams, as had been arranged, next day. This cleared the road for the initiation of treaty negotiations between the two Govern ments with the participation of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom A mission from Transjordan arrived in Jedda on the 22nd April. It consisted of Colonel Cox, the British Resident at Amman, who was associated as a British representative with His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda; and Taufiq e} Abdul-Huda chief secretary to the Transjordan Government as representative of the Amir Abdullah; with Captain Glubb as expert. The mission was received with great distinction. Its members, and Mrs. Cox were entertained as Government guests at the Kandara villa. Formal negotiations 3 ' 0 ”, the ^ d A prl1 and P ro&lt; f eded actively, in a fairly favourable atmosphere end? K ! ?

The only incident worth recording is the arrival at Mecca in the company of the Amir of Tebuk, of one Karayim-bin-Atiya, whom the Transjordan authorities had decided, in the interests of the Saudi Government, to put out of harms way in Palestine. After successfully playing a double game, this man made his peace with the Saudi authorities and now seems to be in high favour, all the higher because of the yarns he has spun about the inducements held out to him in Transjordan to work against Ibn Saud 00 I he Iraqi representative scored a partial success during April in his negotiations regarding the properties of the Hashimite family in the Hejaz a subject which interests His Majesty’s Government as one affectino- the personal “ Xldh- A The A n dU ! lah ’ bUt ln / hich ^ are Unwillin K t?involve them- sel\es officially.

There is little of interest to record under this heading. The pilgrimage and the predominant importance of the negotiations in regard to relations between Saudi Arabia and Transjordan prevented any important subjects ot her than the latter from being pursued between His Majesty s Government and the Saudi Government. The French Charge d’Affaires has been almost invisible but is said to have taken a strong line on behalf of the lady mentioned in paragraph 72 below. The Netherlands representative has been kept busy, despite the smallness ot this year s pilgrimage from Java, by arrangements for the repatriation of over 2,U destitutes, who have been accumulating for some time past and are now being sent home at the joint cost of private contributors to a charitable fund and the Government of the Dutch East Indies. The Persian Charge left Jedda, with his usual joy in terminating his short spells there, on the 25th April. Afghanistan has been in evidence owing to the large percentage of Afghans in a small overseas pilgrimage and the presence among them of several diplomats beside the Afghan Minister for Foreign Affairs. An Afghan consulate has been established in principle in Jedda, and it 'was announced on the 14th April that bilahuddm l^ba 11 Saljuqi had obtained a Saudi exequatur with effect from the 11th April. Ibis ^ gentleman is also consul at Bombay, and the present intention seems to be merely fo detail him for work at Jedda during the pilgrimage season. He arrived on the 16th March and left for India on the 25th April. IV.— Miscellaneous. 68. Sir Andrew Pyan cleared up with Fuad Bey on the 1st April the affair of the visit of H.M.S. Penzance to the Farsan Islands, which, it proved on a review of previous correspondence, ought either not to have taken place or ought to have been notified to the Saudi Government. The latter seem to be contemplating the adoption of general regulations for the visits of foreign warships to othei ports. Meanwhile the Farsan Islands’ affair cast no shadow over the visit of Penzance to Jedda from the 1st to 8th April. Several of her Somali ratings made the pilgrimage. , . „ 69. The Imperial Airways Hanno, one of the large aeroplanes used for the Indian service, made a forced landing near Jubail, after having lost its way in thick weather, on the 31st March and got into difficulties in the sand. It was fortunately possible to inform the Saudi Government without delay and their subsequent remonstrance was comparatively mild, but the incident has drawn attention to the difficulty of avoiding at least occasional flying over and even landings of a kind which they resent as being violations of territory. The local authorities behaved w^ell and helped to extricate the Hanno from its predicament without awaiting instructions, so that she reached Bahrein safely on the 1st April. 70. Mr. A. S. Calvert arrived in Jedda on the 22nd April and took up his duties as head of the Chancery of the Legation, in succession to Mr. Hope Gill. 71. Lady Evelyn Cobbold returned from the Mecca pilgrimage on the 7th April, exhausted, and not having met Ibn Saud, but happy in the illusion that she was the first European of her sex to accomplish the pilgrimage. She left for England on the 9th April. A certain relief was perceptible in various quarters, butTit was doubtless due to ignorance only that a local paper transformed her name into “ the Lady Zeynab Awful Bubble.” 72. Lady Evelyn had a potential rival in the person of a Frenchwoman with a singular past in Syria, who had conceived the idea of getting to Mecca and obtaining copy for a book by marrying ad hoc a Nejdi sojourner in byria. The couple were foiled by French authorities in feyria, but were united, it is said, by a Qadhi at Haifa. When they got to Jedda the husband was unable to get per mission for the lady to go to Mecca. Shortly afterwards he died in Jedda, in circumstances which convinced the Saudi authorities that she had poisoned him. Meanwhile the lady had contracted an intimacy with the handsome but ne’er-do- well son of the French Charge d’Affaires. This young man has been wafted away, but at the end of the month the lady was still in durance pending a decision as to whether she should be put to death or merely deported.0 73. The following table shows the estimated number of pilgrims from over seas, the only countries sending more than 1,000 being shown separately :— Indians (British India) ... ... ... 7,040 Dutch East Indies ... ... ... 2,415 French North Africa ... ... ... 1,284 Egypt ... ... ... ... T621 Afghanistan ... ... ... ... 2.403 Bokhara ... ... ... ... 1204 Others ... ... ... ... 4 ’q59 Total 20,026 Ehus the overseas pilgrimage, despite the increase in certain contingents like those from Afghanistan and Bokhara, justified the gloomiest anticipations. It is not known how many overland pilgrims went to swell the grand total at Arafat, but it is doubtful whether they brought it up to more than 40,000. There were comparatively few from the Yemen, which has sent numerous pilgrims in recent years. 75. The climatic conditions were good and the sanitary state of the pilgrimage was excellent. The ^audi authorities had no difficulty in declaring it clean. The Legation was satisfied after making its own enquiries that this declaration could be accepted and that south-bound ships need not be required to call at Kamaran. Special precautions were, however, taken to ensure as far as possible that all pilgrims embarked had been vaccinated for small-pox within a reasonable past period. The Alexandria Quarantine Board also declared the pilgrimage clean on the 1/th April after the first examination of pilgrims returning northward at Tor. 76. The regatta for pilgrimage ships held annually during the pilgrimage season took place on the 6th April. It was successful, but the number of the entries for some of the events was small. 77. The position in regard to the manumission of slaves in April was as follows : — On hand at beginning of the month : None. Took refuge in April: Four males. Manumitted in April and repatriated : None. Locally manumitted : None. On hand at the end of the month : Four males.No. 1584/76/25 HIS Majesty’s Minister Jedda presents his compliments to The Political Agent at Bahrain and has the honour to transmit to him the under-mentioned documents.

(See para.81,) He returned to Mecca on May 2S. Fuad Bey Hamza returned to Mecca on the day of the Transjordan mission's departure hut has since adhered faithfully to his rule of attending the Jedda hranch of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs once a week. 'The f Iraqi jurist, Muwaffaq al Alusi, who entered Ibn Sa ? ud r s service last November s v/as appointed Legal Adviser to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, quarrelled with Fuad Bey and became counsellor to the King atreligious and civil. It received the King's assent the same day and was confirmed by the people of the He^az on May 15, when the Amir Feysal and local governors received the Bay a, of all and sundry persons of any notability. The Heir Apparent himself was not present at Mecca. 61. Cn May 17 the Amir Feysal with a number of Junior princes and certain other delegates left for Riyadh to deliver the documents containing the Hejazi Bay'a and tahe part in a further ceremonial there. This took place on May 22 and was generally similar to that in Mecca a week before. It was noted as of special imnortar.ee that the Amir Muhammad, the King's slightly eider or somewhat younger brother, was the first to perform the Bay’a. Among the others present were the head of the Araif branch of the family and the Amirs of the House of Rashid. The only important royalty not present was the King's second brother the Amir Abdullah, who however wrote a loyal letter, excusing himself on the ground that the King had ordered him to stay cehmd. Tne ceremonial included the reading of a letter from the king to nia heir, amplifying the injunctions and advice which ho had already addressed to him by telegraph. 82. Nothing further was hoard in Jedda during May of the progress of the National Bank and Mecca-Jedda Railway schemes. The battle for the Hasa petroleum concession ended in the last week of the month. The representatives of the 'Iraq Petroleum Company left Jedda at a moment’s notice on May 24.

Mr, Philby, acting expressly on behalf of Sharqieh Ltd. , secured early in the month the contract foreshadowed in para.59 of the last Report. He left on May 18 for Egypt and England to make financial and other arrangements. The first part of a summary of the contract published on May 25 confirms generally the forecast in the last Report. The contract is for ten years. As the published summary had net been completed by May 31, further particulars are reserved for the next Report. 84. A communique published on May 12 regarding this agreement modifies the communique mentioned in para. 59 of the last report to the extent of authorising the importation by individuals of cars of any make for their private use but a clause in the agreement with Sharqieh prohibits their being plied for hire, 85. The Sa’udi Government brought into force on May 4 a new customs tariff, which was published on the following day. Its most notable feature is the introduction of specific duties per unit on a large range of staple commodities including food-stuffs, piece- goods, sugar and petroleum products. A d valcrer duties, at raises which in nearly all cases show a heavy increase, are retained for a limited number of commodities the most important of which are motor vehicles, perfumes, silk, raw and manufactured cotton end metal goods. Various small surtaxes levied previously have been suppressed. It is difficult in a market so ill-equipped and so inarticulate to ^udge of the effect of the new tariff as a whole but such estimates as can be made point to an .increase, in me so cases hea\y, practically all along the line. This may be offset to seme small extent by the advantage of having to pay duties of known amount in most cases instead of having them assessed on the results of ignorant and perhaps dishonest valuation. 86. Although the financial situation of the Sa’udi Government continues to be precarious, money appears to oe available to meet current obligations, as opposed to the old debts payment of which /was4 KV'rJ'f/l engage'I for one year early In 1932 left tefia for coed on May 18, havin'- 1, aoooin.nli.oneo. nothmg luring has tv&lt; o oy c onj/ns ^.n 'fc-*3 Hejaz and having greatly suffered in healtn.

Fhff'iriR vlllll- .xhl j^T^M^gjiLATlO yS in APA3IA . The negotiations for a treaty settlement between Sa’udi Arabia and Transjordan (See para.S3 of tho last deport) were pursued actively in Jedda from April 23 to May 4 inclusive. The main basis of discussion was three drafts of a Treaty of Friendship and Bon Voisinage, an Arbitration Protocol and an Extradition Treaty modelled with necessary alterations on the similar agreements /concludedIt v/as concluded between Sa*udi Arabia and ’Iraq in April 1931« realised that certain other matters would have to be provided for in ancillary texts notably the question of a working arrangement for the determination of tribal nationality, arrangements of detail for the collaboration of frontier officers and the notes to bo exchanged between His Majesty’s Government and the Sa ? udi Government in fulfilment of the promise given by the former to accept responsibility for the performance of obligations entered into by the Amir ’Abdullah and his Government* 90. It became evident in the course of the negotiations that it would be impossible to negotiate an extradition treaty containing the safeguards considered essential by His Majesty's Government and the Transjordan Government in regard to political offences and judicial procedure. The Sa’udi delegates eventually agreed to post- -pone such a treaty indefinitely. This cleared the way for the practical completion of the draft treaty of Friendship and Bon Voisinage and a draft Arbitration Protocol. Ibn Sa c ud appeared anxious that tnese instruments should be signed before the Transjordan mission left. So much progress was made cn May 3 after his arrival in Jodda that morning that it looked in the evening as though this might be accomplished. By next morning, however, the Sa’udi Government had decided to go slow and it was agreed to postpone the proceedings, in accordance with the agreement reached in the earlier diplomatic discussions that if the conference could not re a; &gt;h a final result in Jedda, it should be resumed later in J erusalen. — ixO II. x oS-LCi- io ft on May 5. 91. The atmosphere of the conference was excellent* The Sa’udi delegates mastered successfully on the whole their natural tendency towards meticulousness over*minor details. They used various devices to try and emphasise the inferior status whicn they attribute to the Amir ’Abdullah but yielded to firm resistance on the other side to anything in the nature of a formal recognition of inequality between /thethe parties* Since the departure of the mission friendly conversations have talcen place “between His Majesty’s Minister and Fuad Boy with a view to so reducing the number of contentions questions still outstanding as to ensure the success of the second stage of the negotiations, which it has “been agreed to hold in the latter part of July, if possible. This should be feasible, subject to an agreement of some sort, which may have to reserve a small number of specially difficult cases, in regard to tribal nationality. The greatest difficulty arises over the Sirhan tribe who have long been settled in Transjordan but have certain rights of property in the Wadi Sirhan and frequent a part oi* it for winter grazing. Their grazing rights have recently been interfered with by the Governor of Qaf and their rights of property may be endangered, if a settlement cannot be reachodc 92. No raids were reported from the frontier during May. The Sa’udi Government complained of the killing of a man earlier in the year by a Transjordanian police patrol. The moi dent t was already known to the Legation which returned an immediate :*ntorfa reply to the effect that the man had lost his life after attacking the patrol in a ravine, 93, Relations between ’Iraq and Sa’udi Arabia appear to be normal. The question of Hashimite properties (para.65 of last Report) is not so advanced as the acting ’Iraqi Charge d’Affaires seemed to hope in April. This and the failure of the Sa’udi Government to send a representative to Bagdad were among the more important 'Iraqi grievances set forth in the Bagdad 'Saut-al-’Iraq' of April 19 and reproduced with a conciliatory rejoinder in the Mecca 'Umm-al-Qura' of May 15. Rushaid Pasha, who was appointed Sa’udi Charge d’Affaires and Consul-General at Bagdad in 1931 cut never proceeded, has now been made Sa’udi Consul in Damascus. A new appointment to Bagdad was made in May, the person chosen being Ibrahim ibn Muammer, who has held the posts of head of Divan to the King and she Amir Sa’ud. /ItIt was announced in the 'Urnm-al-Oura” of May 26 that representative* of Sa’udi Arabia and ? Iraq were to meet at Jauf to discuss various outstanding frontier incidents. 94, The agreement between the Sa’udi and 'Iraqi Governments regarding the motor-route from Necef to Medina (See para.5 of the January Report) is said to have been completed but details are not yet available. 95. Ibn Sa'ud and the Imam of the Yemen continue to play their diplomatic game, despite all rumours of tension and frontier trouble. Nothing further was heard in May about Hasan al Idrisi, nor of the final arrangements in regard to his more important brother Abdul- Wahhab.(para.66 of last Report.) The latest news in May was that Ibn Sa'ud had sent three officials from Jizan to San’a to negotiate a treaty of Friendship and Bon Voisinage. The members of the mission are Khalid al Qarqani and Hamad Suleyman, who were sent to 'Asir in November to patch up a settlement there bu^ arrived too late,and Turki al Madhi, Inspector General in 'Asir. The official announcement in the 'Umm-al-Qura’' was accompanied by an unofficial explanation in reply to Yemeni criticism, of wny tne Ja*uc.i Government had published the letter mentioned in para 21 of the Report for February and how they had come, owing to muuilauion in telegrapnic transmission, to omit a passage in which the Imam apparently made his consent to new negotiations conditional on their including a settlement of the frontier. This may give rise to difficulty, as the Sa'udi view is that the frontier has already been settled in principle and that only some sort of delimitation is needed, whereas the Imam may have pretentions to slices of 'Asir. 95 # After full consideration of the difficulties which have been created by attempts to escape payment of transit dues at Bahrain on goods for Sa'udi Arabia and which culminated in the affair mentioned in para. 362 of the Report for November-December, His Majesty’s Oovarnment decided to take up the position that the concession made /toto Ibn Sa’ud in 1920 was unilateral and terminable 'but that, as Bahrain and the ma nil and had. a ceimion interest — a the oracle, the situation iiiirht usel'ully he reviewed an rhe ligho oO changed conditions at a meeting between Sa'ucli an!

The views of His Majesty’s Government were set forth in a nose addressed hy His Majesty’s Minister to the Sa’udi Minister of Sin Foreign Affairs on May 13- The Minister for Foreign Affairs replied on May 21- The Sa’udi Government did not contest the statement that the concession of 1920 was unilateral and terminable but said that the incident of last November had caused them to arrange for direct transport to Has Tanura, where port facilities had been arranged- They added that they did not wish to limit the freedom of Bahrain as regards transit dues, provided that those charged on goods for Sa’udi Arabia were not higher than those on goods for other destinations. This reply necessitates a furthe: .t »- c.^ the whole cuostione 97.

It is known that the Bhsykh received messages in February through a confidential agent of Ibn Sa’ud and he made two mysterious journeys into Hejd soon after with a party which included Major Holmes’ Arao Jackal. It is suggested that he met some high personage, possibly Ibn Sa’ud himself. The speculations which this has suggested to the Politxcal Agent are of great interest but it would be premature to pursue the subject in this Report. In the meantime there has been no relaxation of the Sa’udi embargo on trade with Kuwait and Ibn oa $&amp; has emphasised his adverse attitude by again allowing the -bitair tribe to obtain supplies in -Iraq. /HI.III. RELATIONS WITH POWERS OUTSIDB ARABIA. 98* There is even less to record than there was last month. The Sa’udi Government have accepted an invitation to attend the Vorld Economic Conference and have appointed their Minister in Eondon to represent them. The foreign missions in Jedda have not &gt;een as a whole very active. The British Legation has been mainly busy with Transjordan affairs and the winding up of the pilgrimage. The Soviet Minister has been trying to put his trade arrangement (See para. 23 of the Report for February) on a firmer basis. The acting 'Iraqi Charge d* Affaires has always something on hand (See paras. 93 and 94 above.) The Netherlands Legation has nearly finished repatriating its destitutes and the Charge went on leave on May 18. The Italian Minister and the Turkish Charge were aching to follow him on June 2. 99. Yet another European power has awoken to interest in Sa'udi Arabia. It was announced on May 19 that the Czechoslavakia Consul in Jerusalem had forwarded papers through the Sa'udi Consul in Damascus and had been accepted as consul for Jedda. IV. MISCELLANEOUS. 100. The Italian cruiser ’’Libia 1 ' called at Jedda on May 6 on her way to Italy from the Far East and left on May 8. There appears to be no reason to attach political significance to this visit but the presence of so large a 'warship in the roads of Jedda is unusual and the suggestion that she came to this port by arrangement with the Sa'udi Government to take water and supplies is singular. There were no spectacular demonstrations. 101. The Frenchwoman mentioned in para.72 of the last Report languished in a police cell throughout the month, sustained with victuals and Vichy water from the French Consulate. It is understood that the police inquiry was terminated and that she would be put •n trial before the Qadhi. The Sa'udi authorities are thought to be •mbarrassed between jealousy of their sovereign rights and fear that tut /lest/ lest the condemnation on a murder charge of an European woman, however much a Ne^di by marriage, should outrage foreign opinion. The affair will almost certainly end in the woman's deportation. If she were condemned, the execution of a woman would he repugnant to Moslem ideas and it is by no means universally believed that she did in fact poison her husband, A way out may he afforded by the application of a theory, which would he convenient on the present occasion, however distressing it may he for persons in the married state, that in Moslem law there can he no conviction for such an offence unless two persons have witnessed the administration of the poison; and, adds Mr. Philhy, two persons who kn^w it to he poison, 102. Captain H.C.Armstrong, the author of 'Grey Wolf', was on his way to Jedda on May 31, by appointment with Ihn Sa ? ud, to collect material for an account of His Majesty. It was doubtful whether the King would consent to this*project and he drew the line at allowing his would he biographer to stalk him to Riyadh, hut the Sa'udi passion for provr.•••;?:. da sow.s to have 'riuiophcd over any fears that mu ad Bey Hamza • s perusal of 'Grey 7/olf ' may have Inspired. It is not known whoirei me'.rM'cs have occn taken to guard against a strong and me dorr, hauling of the King’s love affairs. 103. Jedda grows very hot and si: cky and there was a considerable exodus of foreigners in Huy. 104, The disposal of this year's pilgrimage was almost complete by the end of May. The total number embarked for India up to May 31 was 9791: for Malaya, about 102. There have been the usual troubles in connexion with destitutes. 199 Indian pilgrims of this kind were shipped on May 23 and there was reason to fear that a good many more would come forward. A small hut vociferous band of ol ilzmtzuis destitute Palestinians and Trans-Jordanians proved a considerable nuisance but were well in the way of final disposal at the end of /thetfe* ****** 7h* ©f othcy deoil tut© Bottleh fllcrime foedented lee© difficulty thie year* 105* The position in ref end to the ntamaiseion of el eves in May was as follows :- On hand at beginning of aonth, S nales Took refuge in May# 4 11 Manumitted in May * repatriated* 1 male Locally manumitted Nil.

The question of the disposal of slaves who have to be repatriated and are not clearly repatriable to the Sudan continues to create occasional difficulty.n OCPIDMTIAL. HO. F.81-H/33.

I HAVE the honour to submit herewith the Jedda report for June 1933. 2. Copies have been distributed as in the list appended to the report for 106. THE King came from Mecca to Jedda on the 10th June and returned on the 12th June. He held the usual formal reception, and on the 11th June gave Sir Andrew Ryan a business audience at which the main subject of discussion was the Transjordan frontier negotiations (see paragraph 117 below). His Majesty received his intending biographer, Captain F. H. C. Armstrong, no less than five times and discoursed to him freely for over ten hours in all, not only of war, &amp;c., but of love, also of the many errors into which other writers, including Messrs. Philby and Ameen Rihani, had fallen. Fuad Bey Hamza acted a good deal as interpreter and as sub-inspirer, but the most notable feature of the varying company at the interviews was the frequent presence of Ibn Baud’s brother, Abdullah, on whose memory he seemed to rely for much. The King left Mecca for Riyadh on the 21st June and arrived on the 25th June. He will probably spend the rest of the year in Nejd. 107. The excitement over the appointment of an Heir Apparent has died away, but may be responsible for a report from one source early in June that Ibn Baud contemplated abdication in the Amir’s favour. The King himself spoke to Sir Andrew Ryan on the 10th June of his hope of being able to delegate work, e.g., in regard to Bedouin affairs, to the Amir a year or two hence. 108. The Amir Feisal attracted no attention during the month until he went into summer residence at Taif on the 25th June. Fuad Bey Hamza attended three times at the Jedda branch of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. Sheikh Yussuf Yassin returned from leave in Syria on the 25th June, much pleased with the attention he had been shown in Jerusalem, and went straight to Mecca, en route for Riyadh to join his master. 109. There were no further developments in connexion with the economic schemes mentioned in paragraph 82 of the last report. Some regard the National Bank scheme as already dead. The oil negotiations in regard to Hasa seem to have stimulated interest in other oil possibilities. On the 4th June Fuad Bey brought a confidential message to Sir Andrew Ryan from the King to the effect that he had been approached by Italian interests, working through a representa tive in Cairo, regarding the possibility of a concession for Asir and the Farsan Islands. The King intimated that, now as always, he preferred to do business with the British, and asked whether any British group was likely to be interested in this proposition. He was doubtless thinking back to the time when Shell started operations through a subsidiary in the Farsans, but abandoned them in circumstances now only of historical interest. 110. The further instalment of the Umm-al-Qura account of the agreement with Mr. Philby’s company (see paragraph 83 of the last report) threw little further light on it. The Government undertake that during the term of the agreement, which is to be ten years, all cars imported for their use and that of authorised transport concerns, except cars for their special use and heavy lorries, shall be Fords. Sharqieh (Limited) are to have the first refusal of orders for January. I have, &amp;c. ANDREW RYAN. Enclosure in No. 1. Jedda Report, June 1933. I .—Internal Affairs. [851 u—1] ENCLOSURE IN NO. 3 $ FROM SECRETARY, POLITICAL Adi SECRET DEPT. INDIA OFFICE2 cars for special Government use and for lorries on terms equal to those offered by other vendors. Although private persons may import cars of any make, it is provided in this contract that they shall not ply for hire. The company get a monopoly of all import of tyres and other accessories. They undertake to provide service stations at Mecca, Jedda, Medina, Riyadh and other places to be agreed upon. Conditions are laid down for the fixation of prices of tyres, &amp;c., but not, in the published summary, of those of the actual cars. The margin over factory prices allowed in the case of the former appears very small to cover overhead expenses, depreciation and profit. All goods supplied to the Government and the transport companies are to be charged to an account payable out of 50 per cent, of the receipts of the Naqaba or Government organisation in control of transport. It is considered doubtful whether the contract is a feasible business proposition, and there is no news up to date of Mr. Philby’s success in his efforts to obtain financial backing. He has gone on from Egypt to England. 111. There has been a revival of interest in the scheme for supplying Jedda with water from Waziriya (see paragraph 167 of the report for May-June 1932). The Government have enlisted the expert, though not apparently, the financial assistance of the capable Ain Zubeyda Committee in Mecca. A leading member of this committee, a highly respectable Indian of Mecca, claims to have discovered an underground stream of fresh water much superior to the brackish well-water raised by Mr. Twitchell’s windmill. In the latter half of June a gang of over 100 labourers from Mecca were employed on the underground works. 112. A regulation prescribing additions to the two schedules of goods subject to specific duties and the goods subject to increased ad valorem duties (see paragraph 84 of the last report) was published on the 23rd June. 113. There was no visible change in the financial situation in June. 114. The internal situation continued to be peaceful, as far as could be judged. Ibn Musaid, Governor of Hail and cousin to the King, who had been in charge of the operations in Asir, arrived in Mecca on the 13th June and left for Hail on the 24th June. It is claimed that he had not only repressed the rebellion, but had reorganised the Administration. The appointment of new Governors at Abha, to which place Turki-as-Sdayri, a relative on the maternal side of Ibn Saud has been transferred from Jauf, and at Jizan was announced on the 23rd June. The Umm-al-Qura has published much about the present and past of Asir, insisting on the thesis that the theatre of the rebellion was not Asir proper but the districts of Sabya, Jizan and Abu Arish, which are more correctly called Tihamat Asir, the littoral region as opposed to the inland region of Asir proper or Asir Surat. Tihamat Asir, the former territory of the Idrisi, now becomes a province to be ruled by the Governor at Jizan assisted by a council under the general supervision of the Governor at Abha. Although all seems so stable in Asir, a feeling of misgiving persists in many quarters. It was intensified in June by reports that quite important forces were again being sent thither both by land and by sea. A launch, which the Government bought some years ago through Mr. Philby, and which was long thought to be useless, was put into working order some little time ago and has been running to and from Jizan. It is hard to judge whether the forces sent are reinforcements with a view to possible fighting, replacements of casualties and cases of disease or reliefs. It is possible that the despatch of troops is a result of the alleged tension in the hinterland (see paragraph 121 below). 115. Before leaving for Riyadh the King approved of several other appoint ments to provincial governorates, notably in the region near the Transjordan frontier, where there has been a considerable redistribution of posts. He also conferred a title equivalent to that of Poet Laureate on Ahmed Ibrahim-al- Ghazzawi, the Secretary of the Legislative Council and a well-known versifier and publicist. No mention was made of a salary, much less a butt of sack, to inspire his further efforts. Pegasus treads on air, unaided by such stimulants, in Arabia. 116. An amendment to the existing regulations on firearms was published on the 2nd June. It was not as a whole important, but it provided that licences to carry arms should not be issued to foreigners except on production of a certificate from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. A regulation on the practice of medicine, pharmacy, &amp;c., by private persons was published on the 8th June. It is not illiberal in conception, but it is too soon to judge of its practical effects, if it should have any.II .—Frontier Questions and Foreign Relations in Arabia. 117. Sir Andrew Ryan’s conversations with Fuad Bey Hamza regarding the projected Saudi-Transjordan settlement (see paragraph 91 of the last report) were continued on the 4th and 20th June with satisfactory results. The question of a working agreement on tribal nationality still presents difficulty, especially as regards the Sirhan tribe. When Sir Andrew Ryan outlined the state of the negotiations to Ibn Saud on the 11th June, His Majesty made light of all obstacles and dismissed the question of the Sirhan as one which could easily be disposed of by a comparison of evidence. It was clear on the 20th June that Fuad Bey’s cue was to get on with the final settlement at almost any cost. He and Sir Andrew Ryan agreed that so little remained for discussion except matters of drafting that the second stage of the formal negotiations might safely be proceeded with, and it was decided in principle to suggest a meeting of delegates in Jerusalem on the 24th July. His Majesty’s Government and the High Commissioner have since concurred in this proposal. In the last days of June Sir Andrew Ryan prepared from copious evidence adduced in Amman a memorandum justifying on historical and other grounds the Transjordan claim to the Sirhan tribe. At the end of the month two or three incidental matters were under consideration, the most important being a suggestion that the actual signature of the texts to be agreed in Jerusalem might take place at Amman. 118. On the 10th June the Saudi Government produced another complaint similar to that mentioned in paragraph 92 of the last report regarding the alleged killing of two persons by men of the Arab Legion on the 15th May. Sir Andrew Ryan replied that in his opinion it could be assumed that any report of unprovoked killing was unfounded, and asked for various particulars. 119. The principal development as between Iraq and Saudi Arabia during the month was what appears to be a satisfactory settlement of the question of Hashimite properties. A rescript addressed by Ibn Saud to the Amir Feisal orders the removal of the restrictions previously imposed on the properties of all Ashraf, with the exception of the Sherif Khalid, who was implicated in anti- Saudi conspiracies last year. 120. The statement in paragraph 94 of the last report relative to the conclusion of an agreement between Iraq and Saudi Arabia regarding the proposed motor-route from Nejef to Medina was premature. The Iraq Govern ment completed the necessary surveys on their side some time ago, but the Saudi Government have not yet notified the completion of similar surveys on their side. 121. The Saudi mission to San’a had made little or no progress when last heard of owing apparently to the further illness of the Imam. There have been definite rumours of Yemeni military activity in Najran. Fuad Bey told Sir Andrew Ryan on the 20th June that there was no official confirmation of these reports, but that if they were true a serious situation would arise. He defined the Saudi contention as being that the frontier settlement which, in their view, was reached by the mission that went to San’a in 1927, gave Najran to Ibn Saud and left the bulk of the Beni Yam country which Fuad Bey identified with the geographical area of Jauf to the Imam (see paragraph 93 of the last report, and paragraph 114 above). 122. On the 4th June Fuad Bey told Sir Andrew Ryan that Ibn Saud had written a letter to the Sheikh of Koweit making a proposal which, if agreed to, could subsequently be made official, for the adjustment of their commercial relations. Reports from Koweit show that this letter reached the sheikh on the 16th June and proved to be very obscure. The proposal appeared to be that, if the sheikh would levy the same import duties as those charged in Hasa ports, Ibn Saud would allow the caravans from Koweit to enter Nejd on payment only of a moderate tax to the same amount as one formerly levied by the tribal sheikhs in Ibn Rashid’s time. The sheikh considered the proposal unacceptable, but His Majesty’s Government have suggested that it is worth exploring. No attempt can be made in Jedda to appreciate its true character, but two points are worth noting, viz., {a) the King appears to have suggested to the sheikh that they should settle the matter by a direct deal and not through the British, who could not be trusted; and (b) the reference to Hasa ports suggests that Ibn Saud persists in his hope of developing one or more ports on that coast and cutting out Bahrein. {Cf : paragraph 96 of the last report, the subject of which remains in the same position, so far as the Legation is concerned.) [851 u—1] B 24 III. —Relations with Powers outside Arabia. 123. Anglo-Saudi relations continued to be eminently friendly under the influence of the strong desire of both sides to let nothing cloud the prospects of a settlement of the Transjordan question. Other questions were discussed in Sir Andrew Ryan’s conversations with the King and Fuad Bey, but without insistence on either side. Apart from those adverted to elsewhere, the most important was that of landing grounds for air craft on the Hasa coast (see paragraph 378 of the report for November- December), which formed the subject of a most unsatisfactory counter- memorandum handed by Fuad Bey to Sir Andrew Ryan on the 20th June. This awaits elucidation and discussion* Just before the end of the month anxiety was caused by reports that pressure was being brought to bear on British subjects and British-protected persons from Africa to adopt Saudi nationality and/or to enlist in the army under pain of expulsion. Sir Andrew Ryan wrote a cautionary note on the subject to the Amir Feisal on the 30th June. 124. Nothing important is known of the proceedings of other foreign representatives in June, except as regards the Iraqi success over Hashimite properties (see paragraph 119). The Soviet Minister was again much in Mecca. The French Charge was more of a hermit than ever, although he did appear at the King s birthday party at the British Legation. The corps continues to disinteg rate as summer advances. The Italian Minister and the Turkish Charge left according to plan. The former left in charge M. Tonci, an old colleague of the writer in Morocco. He is very impressive in the Fascist vein, but has so far had no spectacular opportunity of showing what he could do if the hair of a single Italian were touched by Saudi Arabs. The Egyptian consul also went on leave, leaving things very much as they have been for a long time past between Saudi Arabia and Egypt. The new Czechoslovak consul is favourably described in a letter from Jerusalem, which shows inter alia that he is also consul for Iraq and that he may visit Jedda in the autumn. 125. Enquiries by the Saudi Minister in London led the Foreign Office to address to the Legation on the 17th May an important restatement of the views of His Majesty's Government regarding the possible entry of Saudi Arabia into the League of Nations. The general conclusion from a fresh review of pros and cons was that, if the Saudi Government should again approach the Legation, its attitude should be one of complete but sympathetic neutrality; readiness to help with information; and avoidance of any language tending to minimise obstacles or to encourage the Saudi Government to proceed hastily. As a matter of fact, the Saudi Government have not pursued this question in Jedda for nearly two years (see paragraph 49 of the report for July and August 1931). IV.— Miscellaneous. 126. The reception at the Legation on the 3rd June in honour of the King’s birthday was attended by over 110 persons, a very varied collection of British subjects, members of foreign missions and local notables. 127. The Frenchwoman mentioned in paragraph 101 of the last report was released on acquittal about the 28th June, and has since been a guest in the French consulate pending a departure which it is hoped will end a peculiarly foolish and squalid story. 128. Some attention was aroused by the execution in Mecca on or about the 8th June of three persons for robbery with murder. Torture was said to have been used, and it is alleged that a fourth man died under the lash. It was not usual to inflict capital punishment in Mecca under the Turkish and Hashimite regimes The Wahhabi view appears to be the better the place, the better the work of justice. 129 Captain F. H. C. Armstrong fell seriously ill in Jedda just after the sei les oi audiences mentioned in paragraph 106 above. He was embarked for Port Sudan under medical advice and under the care of Mr. Twitchell on the 18th June. He is making a good but slow recovery in hospital at Port Sudan. 130. There are some indications of an inclination on the part of the Saudi Government to buy British. Farly in the month they were reported to be enquiring about aircraft hangars at about £800 apiece, and about shower-baths possibly for pilgrim sanitation. Fuad Bey also mentioned to Sir Andrew Ryan5 &lt;&gt;ii the 20th June a proposal to buy 3 million rounds of Lee-Enfield cartridges through Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co. (Sudan) (Limited). 131. The organisers in India of the proposed Eastern Olympic Games have made various efforts to interest Saudi Arabian sportsmen in their project through official channels. On the 6th June the Legation forwarded through the Ministry for Foreign Affairs a letter addressed by the Maharaja of Patiala to Ibn Saud on the subject. 132. Pilgrimage work during the month consisted principally of winding up odds and ends and preparing the annual pilgrimage report. The Indian vice- consul left for Istanbul on long leave on the 14th June. 133. The position in regard to the manumission of slaves in June was as follows :— Males. On hand at beginning of month ... ... 6 Took refuge in June ... ... ... 2 Manumitted in June and repatriated ... 7 Locally manumitted ... ... ... Nil On hand at end of month ... ... ... l The Legation has taken up with the Saudi Government a case of the alleged resale into slavery not far from Jedda of a young man and a young woman whose father, now at Kamaran, declares that he and they were manumitted by their owner some years ago. Another case of the alleged sale of an ostensible wife by an Abyssinian pilgrim is under consideration, but the evidence is probably too weak to justify action. oTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNfC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT EASTERN (Arabia). August 24, 1933. CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. [E 4921/902/25] No. 1. Mr. Calvert to Sir John Simon. — (Received August 24.) (No. 252. Confidential.) Jedda, August 4, 1933. I HAVE the honour to submit herewith the Jedda report for July 1933. 2. Copies have been distributed as in the list appended to the report for 134. The King remained in Riyadh throughout the month. Emir Feisal, who is summering at Taif, remained there all the month, Taif becoming as usual the headquarters of the Saudi Government during the hot weather, as far as the Hejaz is concerned. Fuad Bey Hamza visited Jedda twice before leaving by the steamship Taif on the 12th July for Egypt en route for the Saudi-Transjordan Conference at Jerusalem (see paragraph 145 below), and Sheikh Abdulla Suleiman, Minister of Finance, paid two visits to Jedda during Fuad Bey’s absence, in circumstances which will be described later in this report (paragraph 148). 135. The Legislative Assembly also moved up to Taif at the end of June, and, according to the Umm-al-Qura of the 30th June, was to resume its session, which had been adjourned on the 29th June, on the 8th July in its summer quarters. 136. A decree was issued at the end of June exempting passengers to Taif by motor-car from road ( £t koshan ”) taxes up to the first week in October. 137. The Hyderabad textile industry scheme (see paragraph 58 (d) of the report for April last) rather unexpectedly took a long step forward with the arrival from India by the steamship Jehangir on the 17th July of a quantity of machinery, believed to be looms, and a number of bales of cotton. Further details are lacking of the materials which, at the end of the month, were lying in the customs warehouse at Jedda awaiting permission for entry into the country free of customs duty, a permission the Saudi authorities show no great alacrity to grant. The stuff is addressed to Dr. Moin-ud-Din, who, together with two weavers, is reported to have come on pilgrimage this year and remained on in Medina. It is understood that official permission for their work, the weaving of “ ihrams,” has already been secured. 138. On the 10th July an official announcement was made by Government decree published a little unusually by special supplement of the Umm-al-Qura of that date, concerning the grant of the Hasa Oil Concession to the Standard Oil Company of California (reference paragraph 109 of last report). The decree appeared alone, and inter alia contained a reference to an agreement; defined the area of the concession vaguely, as “the eastern portion of our Saudi Arab Kingdom, within the frontiers”; and also alluded to a special agreement which was to supplement the main agreement. The terms of the concession were January. I have, &amp;c. A. S. CALVERT. Enclosure in No. 1. Jedda Report, July 1933. I .—Internal Affairs. [879 aa—1] B 12 OCT. 19332 published in two instalments in the Umm-al-Qura of the 14th and the 21st July, and constituted a document of thirty-three articles. The concession, which is for a period of sixty years, is to come into force as from the 7th July, 1933, and active operations were contemplated for the end of September 1933. Payments, designated in the Arabic text £ £ loans, ’ ’ are to be made by the company in two lump sums, the first upon the discovery of oil in commercial quantities, and the second a year later. In addition, an annual payment, termed “rent,” is to be paid, commencing from fifteen days from the coming into force of the agreement, viz., the 22nd July, 1933, and continuing up to the date of the discovery of oil in commercial quantities. Royalties are fixed at 45. gold per ton net weight of crude oil, or the equivalent in United States currency on certain terms, and an annual payment in kind to the Saudi Government of £ £ about ’ ’ 200,000 gallons petrol plus “about” 100,000 gallons kerosene, free of all charge, is agreed upon. Provision is made for the eventual erection of refineries, termination of the contract, &amp;c. Mr. Hamilton, who stated on his departure for London on the 31st May that he expected to return here in two months’ time, is still away and there is little news of his intended movements. Rumour has it, however, that the first instalment of the £ £ loan ” is to be paid next month, and that arrangements have already been made for the shipment on the 4th August from London (or Holland) of a large sum in specie. 139. (Reference paragraph 82.) Both the National Bank and the Jedda- Mecca railway schemes appear to be in the doldrums, as they have given no signs of life during the month. 140. The activity over the water-supply at Waziriya, noted in para graph 111 of the last report, has continued with some success. The water was led through the old underground water-channel to within about half a mile of Jedda (that is, a distance of approximately 11 miles), where an obstacle was encountered and a stoppage in the flow resulted. It is considered that the set-back is only temporary. Meanwhile, the Indian medical officer attached to the Legation conducted an analysis of the water, which he pronounces to be normally safe at source. 141. By notification direct to shipping agents in Jedda, the Director of the Quarantine Administration announced that as from the 20th July the Saudi Government would increase the tonnage dues in force at this port by 100 per cent, in respect of all shipping calling here. The dues hitherto levied were 4 p.T. per 10 tons for the first 500 tons, 2^ p.T. per 10 tons for the second 500 tons, and the balance at 1| p.T. per 10 tons—registered net tonnage in each case. The increase will involve for example for the Khedivial Mail Line, whose ships calling here average 900 tons, an additional sum of about £2 105. per visit, or, they estimate, approximately £250 per annum. The agents of the Khedivial Mail Line here have protested, and other companies have followed suit. 142. The misgivings in regard to the situation in Asir vented in the last report (paragraph 114) proved all too justified by events. Although the province as a whole remained quiescent, and although there was no armed clash between Saudi and Imamic forces on the southern frontier, yet the latter were reported to have been actively engaged with the tribes of the Najran district, an area claimed by both Ibn Saud and Imam Yahya. The situation is delicate, and with so many combustible elements involved, the immediate prospects of avoiding a serious flare- up are not very encouraging. The question, which now largely turns on relations with the Yemen, will be treated at greater length below (paragraph 148). 143. Towards the end of the month a decree was issued authorising Lie formation of a Board of Education, composed of five officials, of whom the most important is the Acting Director of Education, as President. 144. On the 14th July, the Umm-al-Qura published an official decree announcing the Government’s intention to deal drastically with the problem of mendicancy in the Hejaz, particularly in the Holy Cities, where the condition of the beggars, a multitude of unclean, verminous and offensive creatures, was a reproach to all good (and clean) Moslems and a defilement of the sacred places Beggars and the unemployed generally were to depart to their homes, either in this country or abroad. It is not yet known how thoroughly this edict is being followed up. The question, in so far as it concerns British subjects and protected persons, bears a relation to the question of the enforced adoption of Saudi nationality adverted to in paragraph 123 of the June report. The situation, therefore, is being carefully watched (see paragraph 151).II .—F rontier Questions and Foreign Relations in A rabia. 145. Fuad Bey Hamza had two further conversations with Sir Andrew Ryan in connexion with the Saudi-Transjordan negotiations at Jerusalem (see paragraph 117 of the last report), the first conversation taking place on the 2nd July and the final one on the 11th, the day before Fuad Bey sailed for Egypt on his way to the conference. He was seen off at the landing-stage by Sir Andrew Ryan, other members of the diplomatic body and Saudi officials in Jedda. He was followed on the 16th July by Sir Andrew Ryan, who travelled via Port Sudan. The conference, which was to commence on the 24th, was successful, and the treaty was signed at Jerusalem on the 27th July. A message of congratulation from His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom was communicated to the Saudi Government by His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires, and a cordial acknowledgment was promptly received in reply. 146. An echo of the Ibn Rifada revolt of May-June 1932 gave rise to a little uncertainty when it was reported from Jerusalem that Selim Abu Dumeik, a chieftain of the Beni Atiya, who had been removed early in the year to Palestine as a measure of precaution, had evaded surveillance at Beersheba on or about the 10th July, that he was believed to be heading for Transjordan, and that an intensive search was being made for him. The information was communicated by His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires in a personal letter to Emir Feisal, w r ho replied at once informing Mr. Calvert that Abu Dumeik had already arrived at the Saudi frontier, had sued for and had been granted pardon by Ibn Saud. He has since been lost to view, but his movements appear to cause the Saudi Government no anxiety. 147. About the same time a personage whose activities are viewed with much more concern by Ibn Saud also gave occasion for some enquiry. Khalid-bin-Hithlain, a young and warlike chief of the Ajman who was implicated in the rebellion of 1929, was stated by Fuad Bey Hamza in a personal letter to Sir Andrew Ryan to be making preparations to enter Saudi Arabia with evil intent from Koweit, and it is said that his agents were busy assembling supplies in Koweit and Bahrein for the purpose. It was soon established that Khalid-bin-Hithlain was somewhere in the neighbourhood of Kerbela, far enough away from the scene of his alleged activities, and that there was no sign of his agents at either Koweit or Bahrein, whose rulers, moreover, readily gave assurances that preventive measures, were they ever necessary, would be promptly taken. This information was conveyed to the Saudi Government and evoked a grateful response. 148. Relations between Saudi Arabia and the Yemen (see paragraph 121 of the last report) have rapidly and seriously deteriorated during the month. On the 20th July Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, used as a go-between in the absence of Fuad Bey Hamza, called on His Majesty’s Charge d'Affaires and delivered a message from Ibn Saud for His Majesty’s Government, intimating that negotia tions between the delegations at Sana, opened on the 17th, had immediately broken down owing to the inordinate demands of the Imam. These demands, which included the restitution of the territories of the Idrisi, and the districts of the Beni Qahtan and Hamazan, coupled with the consistently hostile attitude of Imamic forces in Najran, and the asylum afforded the Idrisi in the Yemen, had fired Ibn Saud with feelings of the most intense distrust. He charged the Imam with bad faith, breach of the treaty between them and deliberate provocation Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman alleged that the Imam and the Idrisi were receiving- help in the shape of arms and munitions from “ foreign ” sources, and stated he had come to ask for the advice of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom in view of the old friendship subsisting between the two Governments. He left with Mr. Calvert a note from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in which much the same thing was said in good set terms, the “foreign” sources being roundly declared to be Italian, proof of which was in the hands of the Saudi Government. The note also asked for assistance in the matter of supplies. 149. His Majesty’s Government responded, in a note delivered by Mr. Calvert on the 27th July, by urging counsels of moderation and by drawing attention to the risks inseparable from an outbreak of hostilities. At the same time the note made the position of His Majesty’s Government, in the event of hostilities, quite clear as one of strict neutrality. Appropriate steps were also taken through Rome to enlist the co-operation of the Italian Government in a [879 aa—1] b 2nrnmWH ass “ a §®® e ' t with ‘he Imam Yahya, a support which was readily Wrt t rt . ? helkt l, Ab ^ u , llah Suleiman paid a further visit to Jedda on the Julj, and saw Mr. Calvert on that day and again on the 1st August, when to an icipate the report for next month, he had to impart the serious news that the baudi delegation was being forcibly detained in Sana, and that no communication was peimitted between the delegates and their own Government, or, indeed the ^ S \ de ^ ld - J hls new development, which had only come to their knowledge the day before through the receipt of a telegram in cypher to an intermediary .ere purporting to have been sent by Hamad Suleiman, the Minister of Finance's cSrtLr^d\vThd e nll 4 f dele S ation &gt; though an intermediary in Sana, was llntct Ct il !} Abdu la u eimat ! as contrary to civilised usage and neighbour- noticp of rtt M» d ’ . who y as further incensed, asked that it be brought to the Thinh °.

Nasir Bey-el-Gaylani the Acting Iraqi Charge d'Affaires, went on leave on the 5th July, leaving a clerk in charge of consular work only attitude nf°tL th X d p Uly ’ Slr Andre w Ryan asked Fuad Bey Hamza what the attitude ot the Saudi Government would be if an English clergyman wished toI o visit Jedda to hold a service for the British community. This problem had engaged the attention of the Legation for some time in consequence of a suggestion by the Bishop in Egypt and the Sudan that such a visit should be paid by a clergyman at Port Said. Sir Andrew Ryan had formed the opinion that there need be no objection subject to great discretion as regards the arrangements and provided that means could be found to obtain a visa for entry into the Hejaz some time next winter. The matter was precipitated by the receipt at the end of June of a telegram from the chaplain at Port Sudan offering to come over and hold a service on the 9th July. As this telegram was sent en clair, Sir Andrew Ryan felt that there was no alternative but to put a direct question to Fuad Bey. 'The latter replied most categorically that no non-Moslem minister of religion could be admitted for any purpose. Sir Andrew Ryan informed the chaplain at Port Sudan accordingly through the commissioner there, and reported the facts to the Foreign Office. 157. The sloop, H.M.S. Hastings, Captain C. S. Sandford, O.B.E., R.N., arrived from Port Sudan on the 6th July and left again for Suez on the 9th. During the visit the Jedda cricket team regained the ashes. 158. The British community in Jedda were grieved to learn during tiie month that M. van Leeuwen, the Dutch financial adviser to the Saudi Government, who recently left this country on retirement for reasons of ill-health, died at x\msterdam on the 7th July. 159. Messrs. Tallents and Anderson, two members of the firm which manages the Orient Line, paid a flying visit to Jedda on the 9th July on the steamship Talodi. 160. A new doctor, whose name is given as George, arrived during the month from Russia, and is attached to the Soviet Legation in the room of M. Morsen, the dentist, who recently left, it is said, for the Yemen. Dr. George is accompanied by his wife. 161. The Frenchwoman (reference paragraph 127 of last report) acquitted of the charge of poisoning her Arab husband left Jedda by the steamship 1 aif on the 5th July. Her departure from the landing-stage in the French consulate launch did not pass unnoticed—she was a pathetic figure simply dressed in her widows weeds. It is learned that this “femme fatale, still known to the Levantine press as Mme. d'Andhurin, has since acquired another husband. 162. Salvage work has been proceeding for some time on the French Fabre Line steamship Asia, the melancholy wreck lying on the reefs in the roads of Jedda. So far a little over 300 tons of coal of an inferior quality has been recovered, and will, it is supposed, be the property of the Saudi Government, as any claim to the wreck by those originally interested has been abandoned long ago. 163. A curious case, so far the first of its kind, arose during the month when two girls, aged 16 and 13, took refuge in the Legation declaring themselves to be slaves. The family from which they had fled claimed them through the local authorities as daughters of the family who had never been slaves. The Legation refused to hand the girls over without an enquiry, which, however, when held (without the collaboration of the Saudi authorities), proved the self-styled slave- girls to be imposters and the relatives to be in the right in demanding them back as mere naughty and recalcitrant runaways. 164. The position in regard to the manumission of slaves in July was as follows :— On hand at beginning of month : One male. Took refuge in July : None. Manumitted in July and repatriated : One male. Locally manumitted : None. On hand at end of month : None. It has not been possible without fresh evidence to proceed further with the case of the two children of the man in Kamaran (reference paragraph 133 of last report), as the Saudi Government inform the Legation that the daughter is now married and free, whilst the son, who was free, has been resold into slavery. oNo. 1.81-N/33.

Copies have been distributed as in the list appended to the report for 165. IBN SAUD remained in Nejd during the month. Early in August the Amir Feisal left Taif, with his family, for Khurma, a village some distance to the north-east, where he stayed for ten days before returning to Taif. 166. Fuad Bey Hamza, who left on the 12th July for the Transjordan Conference, remained abroad during August, and the Jedda office of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs at the end of the month professed to have had no word as to the date of his return (see paragraph 180 below). The Minister of Finance, Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, continued to deputise for him in various matters passing between the Legation and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs (see paragraphs 177—9 below). He was in Jedda at the beginning of August and again on the 24th. In between he spent a week in Nejd, where, however, so he informed His Majesty’s Charge d’Aft’aires, he did not see the King. 167. The Amir of Jedda, Sheikh Abdul Aziz-bin-Muammar, left for Riyadh on the 4th August and was still away at the end of the month. During his absence Sheikh Ali Taha, the joint Deputy Governor and representative in Jedda of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, was Acting Governor. Sheikh Abdul Aziz, who is reputed to be that rare bird in Arabia—a bachelor—is popularly supposed to have gone to Nejd to find a bride. Indeed, the lady designated by Jedda Society newsmongers is a recently divorced wife of the King, for whom the young Governor has long entertained an all but hopeless passion. It is also averred, in less romantic circles, that the Amir has been called to Riyadh for a consultation with the King. He broke his journey at Taif, one hears, and accompanied the Amir Feisal on his way thence to Khurma. 168. (Reference paragraph 137.) The material which arrived recently for the Hyderabad textile industry scheme was admitted into the country free of customs duties by order of the Minister of Finance, and was forwarded early in the month to Dr. Moin-ud-Din at Medina. The consignment, it is understood, consisted of twenty-four bales of cotton, ten cases containing a total of 110 spindles and one case containing one hand-loom. It is reported that Dr. Moin-ud-Din has already hired large premises in Medina in which to house his scheme, has engaged about twenty hands, both local subjects and Indians, and has had some eight dozen spindles made locally. Whether he will succeed in his. project to manufacture “ Ihrams ” for the pilgrimage arouses a little mild scepticism in some quarters. 169. The rumour regarding the Hasa Oil Concession “ loan ” mentioned in the last sentence of paragraph 138 of the report for July proved to be well- founded, for on the 20th August the sum of £35,000 gold in English sovereigns arrived by the steamship Talodi. It was found impossible to land it that day. EASTERN (Arabia). CONFIDENTIAL. September 27, 1933^ • ^ • j Section 1. Section [E 5724/902/25] No. 1. Mr. Calvert to Sir John Simon.—{Received September 2/.) January. I have, &amp;c. A. S. CALVERT. Enclosure in No. 1. Jedda Report for August 1933. I .—Internal Affairs. [907 dd—1] B2 owing to some confusion over the shipping documents, so the money, contained in seven chests, was carried across to Port Sudan and returned on the 23rd, when it was safely landed and handed over to the Dutch Bank (Nederlandsche Handel- Maatschappij N.V.) here. This sum is confidently asserted in certain quarters here to be a loan, and repayment, it is stated, is to be made gradually against the eventual royalties received by the Saudi Government. I his arrangement, if correctly stated, would therefore be provided for in the ‘ 1 special agreement, the terms of which have not yet been disclosed. Meanwhile, the reports now circulating that the money has been sent on direct to the King at Riyadh and is being used to pay the troops, wear, at least, the air of possibility. The Royal appetite having been thus pleasantly titillated, Ibn Sand is supposed to have already asked for the payment of the second instalment of the loan in advance. 170. Mr. K. S. Twitched, whose movements recently have been not unconnected with the arrival of the Standard Oil Company of California s loan to Ibn Saud, left on the 1st August on a mystery excursion in the direction of Medina on behalf of the Saudi Government. It is believed that he inspected old gold-mines in the Hejaz, which, it is considered, are by no means “ worked out.’ He returned on the 14th, and at the end of the month was on the point of departure by car for the Hasa coast. He was keenly anticipating, in the intervals of seeking new worlds to geologise, repeating a former visit to the wells, p&amp;lni groves and other pastoral delights of Hofuf. He expected to meet Ibn Saud at Riyadh 171. News of the National Bank scheme (reference paragraph 139) is scanty and, what little there is, conflicting. Ihe hgyptian press reports that the ex-Khedive Abbas has abandoned the project on account of difficulties encountered in trying to interest London financiers, whose participation, so runs this report, has been discouraged by the British Government. On the other hand, it is rumoured here that the Minister of Finance contemplates a visit to London, when circumstances and Ibn Saud permit, in order to put in hand the printing of Saudi bank notes. 172. There is nothing further to report on the Jedda-Mecca Railway scheme, save that status reports on Dr. Jeelani are far from encouraging to those who wish to see the scheme succeed. 173. On the 26th August the work of several months on the wells and water supply at Waziriya {vide paragraph 140) was crowned with success, when once again in their history these wells supplied water to Jedda. The event was celebrated on the 26tli by a ceremonial inauguration, at which local dignitaries, the Minister of Finance and a crowd of some thousands were present. The water is brought over the 7 miles from Waziriya and is stored in the reservoir of Idarus on the skirts of one of the poorer quarters of the town. Mr. Twitched states the rate of supply is 40 gallons per minute, and that shortly it will be possible to increase that rate 'threefold. He estimated present water consumption m Jedda at 38 gallons per minute, but other authorities here would place the figure much lower, probably at about 24 gallons per minute. The Waziriya water is free at the reservoir, and the price paid for it per 4-gallon kerosene tin (from ^ to 1 piastre Saudi) is the cost of transport only. It is therefore proving itself a great boon to the poorer inhabitants of the town who are able to draw unlimited supplies of water for the mere trouble of carrying it away. It may thus be expected that Jedda's water consumption will increase, and that the'sales of condenser water (now retailed at 2^ piastres Saudi per kerosene tin) will be adversely affected. The British engineer-in-charge of the condenser plant is inclined to scout this, however, on the grounds that the better-to-do will still buy condenser water for drinking purposes, as Waziriya water, though potable at present, is peculiarly vulnerable to persons of evil intent, and will, it is probably true, be somewhat suspect, as drinking water, for some time to come. . „ „ , , ., 174. The Province of Asir has remained outwardly peaceful {vide para graph 142) in spite of a tense and obscure situation along its southern frontier. As in last month’s report, the situation will again be dealt with in connexion with the situation vis-d-vis the Yemen (see paragraphs 177-9 below). 175. Reports of extreme misery in Medina continue to reach the Legation. This city is the victim of tragic reductions in population and economic circumstances, and the lot of those who remain, few of whom can be fai abo\c subsistence level, is indeed an unenviable one.3 II.— Frontier Questions and Foreign Relations in Arabia. 176. The treaty with Transjordan (reference paragraph 145) was first mentioned by the Saut-ul-Hejaz in its issue of the 8th August and at greater length in an article on the 15th August. It is a little curious that the Umm-al- Qura, usually regarded as the semi-official organ of the Saudi Government, should so far have refrained from any reference to the treaty. 177. The Saudi press has been almost equally mute on the subject of the Yemen (reference paragraphs 148 and 149), whose relations with Saudi Arabia had reached a critical stage at the beginning of August. The detention of the Saudi delegation against their will at Sana, which had further exacerbated Ibn Saud, proved happily to be of short duration, as they were allowed to leave the Yemen on the 3rd August. The Saudi Government, in informing His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires of this on the 6th, attributed the release to the steps taken by His Majesty’s Government, who had requested the Italian Govern ment to make urgent representations to the Imam Yahya. In the meantime (on the 5th) the Minister for Foreign Affairs had addressed a further lengthy note to Mr. Calvert for the information and comments of His Majesty’s Govern ment, setting forth the Saudi desiderata for the settlement of their differences with the Yemen, which included : (i) an apology and satisfaction for the detention of the delegation at Sana; (ii) the Idrisi either to be expelled from the Yemen, or handed over to Ibn Saud, as the shelter afforded him by the Imam Yahya, particularly in such unsettled territory as the Asir frontier districts, was not merely a breach of the treaty, but a token of the Imam’s intention to force a quarrel; (iii) the Imam’s encroachments in Najran w T ere to stop and the frontier there to be delimited; and (iv) all frontiers between the two countries were to be settled. 178. The returning delegation brought with them a letter from the Imam to the King, the contents of which were wirelessed to Riyadh from Jizan. Ibn Saud replied by telegram stating his grievances and the remedies that would satisfy him. At this juncture it was possible to mark a certain detente, in the situation consequent upon the release of the delegation, the apparent absence of any forward movement by Imamic troops in the Xajran, and the resumption of direct telegraphic correspondence between the two rulers. This interlude was interrupted by a report received from the Minister for Foreign Affairs that Husain-ad-Dabbagh, one of the conspiratorial family of that name, had recently landed at Medi and had joined the Idrisi, taking with him supplies and money, and that a certain Adnan, one of Ad Dabbagh’s followers, had established himself at Kamaran as an Idrisi agent. As the result of enquiries, His Majesty s -O Charge d’Affaires was able to inform the Saudi Government that Adnan had left Kamaran on the 16th August. On the 17th His Majesty’s Government replied to the Saudi Government’s request for comments on their desiderata regretting that the position was too obscure and their information too incomplete to enable them to express any opinion. They, however, expressed their pleasure at the release of the delegation and the resumption of direct communication between Riyadh and Sana. 179. On the 25th August Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman called on Mr. Calvert and left with him copies of two telegrams, one purporting to have been received by Ibn Saud from King Feisal, in which the latter, speaking in the name of the Arabs of other countries, expressed the hope that every effort would be made to avoid the shedding of Arab blood and declared his readiness to mediate. The other telegram contained Ibn Saud’s reply, asserting equal concern for Arab blood, declaring his desire for peace and summarising his case against the Imam. He expressed his gratitude, non-committally, to Feisal for his offer of mediation. The Minister of Finance dilated, during this interview, on the impossibility of Arab trusting Arab and again sought the counsels of His Majesty’s Government, to whom this information was conveyed, and whose reply was received before the end of the month, but was held up for oral communication, as Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman had. in the meantime, returned to Taif. Before he left Jedda, however, he informed Mr. Calvert at a further meeting that on the receipt of reports, some three weeks earlier, of mobilisation of troops within the Yemen, Ibn baud had ordered the reinforcement of Saudi forces in the south-west by troops from the north-east. The Minister went on to read a series of telegrams from Ibn Saud [907 dd—1] b 24 to the Imam Yahya elaborating, in firm language, his previous demands. The month closed, therefore, on a somewhat more martial note, and it is perhaps not altogether fanciful to detect in the language of the telegrams addressed to the Imam (at the end of the month still unacknowledged) and the precautionary military dispositions made, a quickening of Ibn Saud’s resolve to brook the procrastinations of the Imam Yahya only a little while longer. 180. The absence of Fuad Bey Hamza (see paragraph 166) is causing a certain amount of comment. The Saut-ul-Hejaz of the 29th August quotes from the A hram. at length, an article which reads into the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs’ recent visit to the Lebanon a move to reopen negotiations with the British and French authorities concerned over the Hejaz Railway. III .—Relations ivith Poivers Outside Arabia. 181. There is little to report under this head. Anglo-Saudi relations continue to be as cordial as ever, the Saudi Government leaning heavily-—or affecting to—on the counsels of His Majesty’s Government to an almost embarrassing degree. Italian shares are not well supported in the 8audi market, where suspicions of Eritrean complicity in the Imam Yahya s piesent attitude are too deep to be easily eradicated. _ 1 T , , 182. The Umm-al-Qura announced on the 25th August that Ibn baud sent a telegram of congratulations to King leisal on the anniversary of the latter’s accession (the 23rd August) and had received a reply the following day. IV.— Miscellaneous. 183. M. Roger Maigret, French Charge d’Affaires, left by the steamship Talodi on the 9th for Syria, where he is spending a short leave of absence. Hamdi Bey, his Algerian vice-consul, remains in charge. . . . , 184. On the 19th Khan Sahib Haji Rashid Ahmad, a Delhi municipal councillor, returning to India from London, arrived by way of Medina, leaving for Port Sudan the following day. He was the bearer of a letter of introduction from the India Office. _ . ^ 185. M. A. N. van de Poll, the Islamised Dutchman, whose Moslem name is Muhammad Husain-el-Mahdi, arrived here by the steamship Alavi on the 12th from Aden, having spent the last three months in Hadhramaut. He lett for Europe on the 25th, after spending a week or so in Mecca 186. Feridoun Bey, the official in charge of the Turkish Legation, tell ^ rather seriously ill about the middle of the month, and on the 27th left, with his wife, for Asmara with the intention of undergoing an operation for appendicitis. 187. Mr. D. Macfarlane, of Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co., accompanied by his wife, paid a flying visit to Jedda, on the steamship Taif, on the 27th. They left the same day for Port Sudan and Khartum. . 188. At the beginning of the month reports were received that a German ship, stated to be the steamship Mosel, ran aground on Perim Island, and, to refloat herself, jettisoned a large quantity of flour destined for Jedda. I he news, which disturbed prices for a day or two, was said to be not unwelcome to the merchants involved, as they were fully insured and over-bought. 189. A Russian ship, the steamship Samaweith (?), arrived on the 30th and left the next day after discharging (both into the dhows and into the sea) a consignment of some 7,000 sacks of wheat, barley and other grain, said to have been brought from Basra. . T i i . a 190. The climate in August has lived up to usual Jedda standards. Throughout the month, skies have been heavy with clouds and sultry nights have been enlivened by occasional thunder and distant lightning. Showers of ram were recorded on several nights. These atmospherics, unfortunately, have meant no diminution in either heat or humidity. But climate apart, it may be admitted that existence in Jedda compares not unfavourably (it is surmised) vv ith normal prison life elsewhere. . , „ 191. From Taif comes news of rains and horse-racing. No reports ot the state of the turf have been received, unfortunately, but it is at least encouraging5 to learn that so young a monarchy as Saudi Arabia is of kings. 192.

October 23, 1933. CONFIDENTIAL. Section 2. [E 6328/902/25] No. 1. Mr. Calvert to Sir John Simon.—(Received October 23.) No. 304. Confidential.) Sir, Jedda, October 2, 1933. I HAVE the honour to submit herewith the Jedda report for September 1933. 2. Copies have been distributed as in the list appended to the report for 193. During the month Ibn Saud remained in Nejd and Amir Feisal at TaiL The Amir of Jedda, Sheikh Abdul Aziz-bin-Muammar (see paragraph 167), was absent the whole month, as was Fuad Bey Hamza, whose return from abroad, however, is predicted for the first week in October. The Minister of Finance, Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, carried on in the latter's absence as intermediary between the Legation and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and visited Jedda twice during September (see paragraphs 195 and 196). 194. Dr. Moin-ud-Din (see paragraph 168) left for India on the 13th by the steamship Jehangir. He proposes, whilst in Hyderabad, to buy a further fifty looms and a quantity of Rangoon teak for spindles for his textile project at Medina, and hopes to be able to stimulate interest in, raise funds and arrange a sales organisation in Hyderabad for the “ihrams,” &amp;c., produced. It would appear that his institution in its present stages is primarily instructional and is intended to promote home industry. 195. As far as can be gathered, the situation in Asir has changed only in regard to the concentration of Saudi military forces in the province against the Yemen. This has proceeded steadily throughout the month. Reports of a conflict at Salla in the Tihamat Asir between Saudi and Yemeni troops, which appeared in the Egyptian press as emanating from Aden, and which were repeated in the Times, were contradicted by Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman in conversation with His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires on the 29th. He admitted that a minor disturbance had occurred some six weeks ago when Saudi troops were used against a small tribe, whose name he professed to have forgotten, inhabiting a village immediately south of Jizan, who had refused to pay their taxes. They had been suitably dealt with and their leaders thrown into prison at Jizan. The general situation will be further treated below in connexion with relations with the Yemen (see paragraph 196). 196. The month opened with relations between Saudi Arabia and the Yemen (see paragraphs 177-9) hardening and with the promise of hostilities in the air. On the 7th, the Minister of Finance, at a meeting with His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, declared the situation remained substantially unchanged. His personal opinion was that the Imam would be allowed to gang his ain gait until Saudi military dispositions were complete, when he would be confronted with an ultimatum. On the 11th, over 700 troops (mainly tribesmen) were embarked on the January. I have, &amp;c. A. S. CALVERT. Enclosure in No. 1. Jedda Report for September 1933. I .—Internal Affairs. II.— Frontier Questions and Foreign Relations in Arabia. [935 z—2] » 72 steamship Jehangir for Jizan, and a further 200 left by dhow on the 18th and succeeding days, although the latter were, according to Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, replacements only. Quantities of stores were both shipped and sent overland by motor transport during the month. Amir Feisal-bin-Saad, nephew of the King, was appointed Commander-in-chief for the present, with headquarters at Abha, but might be superseded by the King’s eldest son, Amir Sand, should it become necessary. On the 29th Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman again informed Mr. Calvert that the situation remained much the same. Correspondence between the two rulers had ceased with a curt and platitudinous acknowledgment by the Imam Yahya of Ibn Saud's telegraphic exposition of his demands. There was no cessation, however, of hostilities in Najran between local tribes and Imamic troops. The Beni Yam had been reinforced by certain kindred tribal elements from the Wadi Dawasir, and were now gradually getting the upper hand and were compelling the Zeidis to withdraw. The month has, therefore, seen no improvement, and unless the efforts of distinguished Moslem leaders abroad, who are reported to be offering to mediate, are unexpectedly successful, the prospects are not such as to encourage much optimism. 197. Hamad Suleiman, brother of the Minister of Finance, and Khalid-bin- Qarqani, members of the Saudi delegation to Sana, were due to arrive in Jedda from Jizan at the end of September. 198 (paragraph 362 of 1932). The question of transit dues on goods passing through Bahrein for the mainland of Saudi Arabia was carried a step further when His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, on the instructions of His Majesty’s Government, informed the Saudi Arab Government on the 9th September that, in view of Saudi unwillingness to accept a proposal to hold a conference on the matter, the Government of Bahrein could see no alternative but to terminate, as from that date, the customs arrangement of 1920 with Ibn Saud. It was still considered that the proposal to hold a conference offered the best prospects of arriving at a friendly settlement. 199. Informal communications, chiefly through Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, have passed between Mr. Calvert and Amir Feisal during the month regarding the exchange of ratifications of the Transjordan-Saudi Treaty, signed at Jerusalem on the 27th July last (see paragraph 145). The Saudi Arab Govern ment are inclined to insist on the exchange taking place at Jedda, but are awaiting the return of Fuad Bey Hamza before taking up a final attitude, in view of His Majesty’s Government’s desire to see the exchange take place at Amman. 200. Telegrams were received on the 5th and 6th from Transjordan reporting the presence of a Saudi military post at Hazim, on the Transjordan side of the frontier with Saudi Arabia. They were reported to be interfering with passers-by and making use of the wells. Urgent representations were made to the Saudi Arab Government, who replied that, pending a demarcation of the frontier, they considered that Hazim lay exactly on the frontier line. A subsequent telegram from Transjordan announced the withdrawal of the Saudi military post by several miles into what was probably Saudi territory. 201. The Umm-al-Qura of the 15th announced that, upon the death of King Feisal, telegrams of condolence were sent by Ibn Saud, Amir Saud and Amir Feisal to King Ghazi and Rashid Ali, Prime Minister of Iraq, respectively, and by Ibn Saud to Amir Abdullah of Transjordan. Suitable replies were in each case received. 202. The same issue of the Umm-al-Qura reported the visit of the Amir Abdullah-bin-Qasim-bin-Thani of Qatar to Riyadh. The visit is represented to have been a friendly one, undertaken with the object of congratulating Amir Saud on his proclamation as successor to the throne, and the Amir is stated to have been hospitably met and entertained by Ibn Saud and his family. III .—Relations with Powers outside Arabia. 203. Anglo-Saudi relations continue friendly. Otherwise there is little of interest to note. The Italian Charge d’Affaires has during the month been endeavouring to obtain from the Saudi Government information on the situation with the Yemen. He appears to have had little success so far, and on the 21st he suggested to Mr. Calvert, as from himself, that the Corps diplomatiqueshould make a joint demarche. Mr. Calvert was unable to show any enthusiasm, and Signor Tonci admitted he had not succeeded with the doyen, the Russian Minister. Jelal Bey, the Turkish Charge d’Affaires, who returned from leave early in September, was understood to be sympathetic, but inclined to dissociate himself from any joint representation, preferring to take his own line. Whether or no this move had official Italian inspiration, it was a complete failure. 204. Signor de Peppo, the Italian Minister, is not returning to Jedda, having received an appointment in connexion with the League of Nations. His successor is not yet known. 205. (Reference paragraph 306 of last year.) Dr. Mahmud Hamdi Bey Hammuda, Director-General of Health, is to represent Saudi Arabia at the forthcoming meeting of the International Health Office at Paris on the 18th October, 1933. Dr. Mahmud Bey, who also attended the meeting held last year, left for France on the 22nd September. IV .—M iscellaneous. 206. (Reference paragraph 170.) Mr. K. S.

The Amir of Jedda, Sheikh Abdul Aziz-bin-Muammar, was still absent it the end of the month (see paragraphs 167 and 193). The Minister of finance, Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, was constantly on the move between l ait, Mecca and Fedda, chiefly occupied in organising the despatch of troops and stores to Asir see paragraphs 217 and 219). \ a ^ 209. Fuad Bey Hamza, accompanied by his wife, returned from abroad on he 9th October by Italian steamer. He was met at the landing stage by loca luthorities and notables, and, clad in “ Thram ” towels only, presented a some what incongruous figure inspecting (very cursorily) the guard of honour mou “t«d tor the occasion. His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires was present to welcome him. Fhe Deputy Minister left the same day for Mecca and three or four days later went on to'Riyadh to pay his respects to Ibn Saud. He was expected to return ^210 Arriving by the same boat as Fuad Bey Hamza, and indeed a membei if his party, was Khalid-al-Hakim, an ex-Turkish officer of Syrian or Palestinian origni whose record may be consulted in this Legations compilation: “ Personalities in Saudi Arabia ” (No. 56). It is interesting in view of press reports that Fuad Bey Hamza’s prolonged leave has not been entirely unconnected with the question of the Hejaz Railway (see paragraph 180), to note that Khalid- d-Hakim accompanied Dr. Damluji in July 1928 to take part m the aboitive conference at Haifa on this question. He left with 1‘uad Bey Hamza for Riyadh 211 (Reference paragraph 169.) On the 18th October Mr. W. J. Lenahan, an official of the Standard Oil Company of California, arrived here and proceeded to establish himself as the company’s Jedda representative. He has had no previous experience of this part of the world, having previously been employed by his company, in an administrative capacity, in South America He recently stated, in conversation, that five geologists of the company had already arrived in Hasa and were now at work, and that more were expected to arrive there shortly. Mr. Twitchell is believed to be soon returning to Jedda 212 (Reference paragraph 110.) Mr. Philby, accompanied by his wife, arrived from the United Kingdom via Port Sudan on the 18tK His return, it is understood was rather hurried, due to difficulties with the Saudi Government over Sharqieh Limited’s motor and tyre concession^ , „ , , 213 (Reference paragraphs 171 and 172). The National Bank scheme remains as much as ever a castle in Spain, and the Jedda-Mecca railway project is still darkly incubating in Madras. One suspe cts the - ----y r ,. [963 dd—1] f'SifleWS » ****■' . \ no. 5 ; 2 . \ FROM 28 DEC.« POUTlG^k‘2 214. The general financial situation is far from reassuring. Government employees, who for a number of months past have been receiving their salaries in the form of one-third cash, one-third in kind (flour, rice, sugar, &amp;c.), and one-third carried forward to their credit, have, according to fairly reliable reports, been latterly receiving nothing at all. The Treasury is said to have adopted the simple expedient of making no disbursements whatsoever, except to a favoured few. Government debts are ignored. Saudi currency has weakened. Large sums have been absorbed by military preparations against the Yemen, and the £35,000 gold received as an oil loan (see paragraph 169) has probably been utilised for the purpose. Altogether the picture is not a pleasant one and the bright spots are far to seek. Of these it may be mentioned that the first pilgrim ship of the season left Sourabaya on the 28th October—but next year’s pilgrimage, by all accounts, will be as disappointing as this year’s. 215. Government Departments and officials were returning from Taif to Mecca during the second half of October. Amir Feisal and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs are expected to last the month out and return early in November. The Legislative Assembly adjourned at Taif on the 24th and reassembles ten days later in Mecca. 216. (Reference paragraph 141.) Whilst it is still doubtful whether the increased tonnage dues on shipping, which were introduced in July, are going to be enforced, certain new taxes on local craft have been announced, during the month, and are to take effect as from the 24th June last. These are :— Piastres miri per month. Motor-launch ... ... ... ... 15 Sanbuq ... ... ... ... 15 Boat ... ... ... ... ... 5 (Where 110 piastres miri = £1 gold.) The annual tax on a motor-launch, therefore, amounts to about £2 10.?., but, in view of the fact that the amount per annum is not excessive and compares not unfavourably with similar taxes in various ports of neighbouring countries, local representatives of foreign shipping concerns have accepted the new tax philosophically. 217. The situation in Asir (reference paragraph 195) continues to monopolise public attention here. Further concentration of Saudi troops has taken place during the month, until, according to Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, scarcely a soldier remains in Nejd, and he confidently expected that Saudi military dispositions would be complete by the end of October. Amir Feisal-bin- Saad was still Commander-in-chief, with his headquarters at Abha. where he is in constant wireless communication with the King, being accompanied wherever he goes by a mobile wireless set. Saudi resources in respect of communications were further augmented by the arrival on the 29th of two large motor-launches, which had come under their own power from Bahrein, where they had been recently acquired by Ibn Sand. They were immediately got ready for use and, to anticipate next month’s report, left on the 1st November for Jizan with about 500 troops on board. At the end of the month the Saudi force had generally advanced, in Asir, to positions somewhat nearer the frontier, in order to be readily available should its defence become suddenly necessary. The situation in Asir will be further dealt with (see paragraph 219 below) in connexion with relations between the Saudi Government and the Icemen. 218. (Reference paragraph 197.) Abul Walid Khalid-el-Qarqani, Sheikh Hamad Suleiman and Turki-bin-Mahdi, the three members of the recent Saudi delegation to Sana, who were for a short period forcibly detained there by the Imam Yahya, left Mecca for Riyadh on the 14th October. II .—Frontier Questions and Foreign Relations in Arabia. 219. The tension between Ibn Saud and the Imam Yahya (vide para graph 196) shows no signs of relaxing. For the first three weeks of October, although military preparations went on unabated, the fact that hostilities did not break out as time went by encouraged the hope that neither side would be rash enough to take the first hostile step and that the situation would remainunprecipitated. A report, attributed to the Saudi delegation to Sana who passed through here early in the month for Mecca, that the two rulers had agreed to a six months’ truce, gave further grounds for optimism. Hopes of this nature, however, were soon dashed by reports, confirmed shortly afterwards, of renewed fighting in Najran, where the Imamic forces were again captained by Saif-al- Islam Ahmad, and the fall of Badr. The Minister of Finance admitted to Mr. Calvert on the 19th October that Badr had been occupied by Zeidi troops upon the defection of the Makarimi, an independent sub-tribe of the Beni Yam. a changed tune from his previous one of a Yemeni withdrawal before victorious tribesmen. He gave another ten days before Ibn Saud presented the Imam Yahya with an ultimatum, and expressed his own view that, as, in his opinion, the Imam would reject the King’s demands, war was inevitable. 220. On the 20th the Umm-al-Quva published an official Saudi communique, in which the situation and its recent developments in Najran were outlined, and Ibn Saud’s pacific intentions and rigid determination to defend his territory restated. The communique called on the Imam to pause and reflect, and to exert himself to avoid the shedding of Arab blood. The Umm-al-Qura on the same day published a leading article on the crisis, in the form of a reply to a recent letter by the Imam to the newspaper Falestin. No ultimatum had been issued by the end of the month, and, acting under instructions, Mr. Calvert informed Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, on the 30th October, that the Italian Government were again urging the Imam to agree to negotiate, and expressed His Majesty’s Government’s earnest desire that, in view of this, every effort would be made by Ibn Saud to avoid hostilities. 221. On the 9th October His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires informed the Saudi Government that the survey of the Koweit Neutral Zone was to recommence about the 1st November from Qurain, 17 miles west-south-west of Ras-al-Qaliya. On the 17th the Minister for Foreign Affairs replied that the Saudi Government had no objection to the resumption of the survey. 222. (Reference paragraph 199.) Further communications relative to the exchange of ratifications of the Saudi-Transjordan Treaty have passed during the month between Mr. Calvert and the Saudi authorities through the Ministry for Foreign Affairs’ local representative at Jedda. Fuad Bey Hamza has been in Nejd since his return from leave, but an early opportunity of treating this question with him in person is now in prospect. 223. On the 15th October Muhammad Hamdi-el-Chokhidar arrived here from Bagdad as acting Iraqi Charge d’Affaires and consul-general, in the room of Nasir Bey A1 Gaylani {vide paragraph 155), who has been appointed vice-consul at Kermanshah. Muhammad Hamdi has previously served in a consular capacity at Angora, Kermanshah and Mohammerah. He is pleasant, speaks a little English, and seems anxious to be friendly. Abdullah Rashid remains here as consular clerk. 224. Forty days after the death of King Feisal, i.e., on the 24th October, the Iraqi Legation held a commemorative reception. Flags were flown half-mast. 225. (Reference paragraphs 5 and 94.) The proposed motor-road between Najaf and Medina appears to have got no forrader. Enquiries from India led the Legation to ask the Ministry for Foreign Affairs for information on the subject. The Ministry replied, on the 18th, that the matter is still under discussion with the Iraqi authorities. III .—Relations with Powers outside Arabia. 226. There is nothing of fresh interest to report as far as Anglo-Saudi relations are concerned—they continue friendly. 227. The Egyptian consul, Hafiz Bey Amer, returned from a lengthy leave on the 8th October. 228. Mr. Calvert was informed on the 27th by Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, as from Ibn Saud, that the King had recently agreed to allow M. Maigret, French Charge d’Affaires, to visit Nejd immediately upon his return from leave. M. Maigret had met Fuad Bey Hamza in Syria and had enlisted his support for his request. Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman emphasised the private and personal nature of M. Maigret’s visit, but, as the latter is to be received by the King in or near4 Riyadh, it is a little difficult to be quite satisfied with the bona fides of this assurance. The visit, however, is not so imminent as at first appeared likely. M. Maigret was expected to arrive on the 28th October by a French naval despatch-boat, the Ypres. which had called at Beirut on its way to the Red Sea. The despatch-boat duly arrived, but the French Charge d’Affaires was not on board. His return is now expected for the 12th November, but Fuad Bey Hamza, who had at first intended to await his arrival in Riyadh, was on his way back to Mecca at the end of the month. IV.— Miscellaneous. 229. Lieutenant-Colonel Ibrahim Depui, M.C., formerly in charge of the French consulate here, and now reported to be employed in the Intelligence Department of the French War Office, arrived on the 20th October by Italian steamer from Massawa, after touring certain Red Sea ports (Aden, Jibuti, Hodeida, &amp;c.). As he is a Moslem, he spent most of his visit to this country at Mecca and Medina; he left for Suez on the 1st November. 230. The French naval despatch-boat Ypres arrived here from Beirut on the 28th October and left the next day. 231. The Saudi Government, in spite of several reminders, have as yet been unable to issue their official tariff of dues and transport charges for the forthcoming pilgrimage season. The Minister of Finance has informed His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires most categorically that the official tariff for 1934, which was in course of being printed as part of the pilgrimage guide published annually in Mecca, was exactly the same as the 1933 tariff. British authorities concerned have been, therefore, notified to that effect. 232. The position in regard to the manumission of slaves in October was as follows :— On hand at the beginning of the month : None. Took refuge in October : None. Manumitted in October and repatriated : None. Locally manumitted : None. On hand at the end of the month : None.COliffIDftNTIAL Ho.

Mr. Calvert to Sir John Simon.—(Received December 28.) No. 347. Confidential.) »)ir, Jedda, December 4, 1933. I HAVE the honour to submit herewith the Jedda report for November 1933. 2. Copies have been distributed as in the list appended to the report for 233. Ibn Saud remained in Nejd during the month. 234. Amir Feisal returned to Mecca from summering in Taif early in November and almost at once left for Jedda, where he arrived on the 8th. He received His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires in formal audience on the 9th and again, this time on business (see paragraph 252), on the 15th. He returned to Mecca on the 17th. 235. Fuad Bey Hamza arrived back in Mecca from Riyadh (see para graph 209) in the first week of November and visited Jedda twice during the remainder of the month. His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires had a lengthy conversation with him on the 12th, the first since the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs’ return from leave, and again on the 21st. 236. Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman continued to flit backwards and forwards between Mecca and Jedda, chiefly occupied with the administration of his depart ments. He is now perhaps less busily employed in organising the despatch of troops and supplies to Asir (see paragraph 244), as Saudi military preparations in the south are believed to be more or less complete. He is, however, bending his energies to intensive deep-sea fishing and generally, nowadays, has some new record to announce. From his activities as Minister of Finance it is not surprising to find him endowed with all the instincts of the born angler. Mr. Calvert was his guest some weeks ago at a late-night fishing expedition. 237. The young Amir of Jedda, Sheikh Abdul-Aziz-bin-Muammar, who left for Riyadh on the 4th August to get married (see paragraph 167) returned to his post on the 30th November. 238. On the 10th November the Umm-al-Qura announced the appointment of Asad Effendi-al-Faqih to the post of assistant in the Saudi Ministry for Foreign Affairs. He is another Syrian recruit to Saudi officialdom and, as he speaks French, has probably been selected by Fuad Bey Hamza, whose knowledge of that language is elementary, partly on that account. 239. The JJmm-al-Qura stated, in its issue of the 24th November, that a municipal administration had now been inaugurated at Riyadh; that royal palaces and Government departments had been linked up by telephone; and that the system had been further extended from the A1 Badia Palace and the royal residence to the Riyadh wireless station. It pointed out with pride that last year a police administration was set up, and added that the lighting of the main streets of the capital is now contemplated. 240. (Reference paragraph 211.) Mr. K. S. Twitched returned on the 15th from the Hasa coast, where he left the Standard Oil Company of California’s geologists at work. 241. Mr. Philby’s difficulties with the Saudi Government over Sharqieh (Limited)’s motor and tyre concession were briefly referred to at paragraph January. I have, &amp;c. A. S. CALVERT. Enclosure in No. 1. Jedda Report for November 1933. I .—Internal Affairs. [991 ee—212 212 in Jedda report for last month. These difficulties had been brewing for several months, and may be attributed to Sharqieh (Limited) s failure to carry out their obligations under their contract with the Government. The latter were in urgent need, for military purposes in connexion with their expeditionary force in Asir, of 200 motor vehicles and a supply of tyres, but Mr. Philby had left for Europe on the 18th May and the vehicles and tyres had failed to materialise, further, the company’s skeleton staff in Jedda had made no attempt to open up service stations in accordance with the terms of the concession. Whilst in England, Mr. Philby got wind of an arrangement under consideration by the Minister of Finance, whereby a consignment of British tyres in the Customs here, imported by Muhammad Sadiq, the King's Indian chauffeur upon authorisation given, it is said, before the grant of the tyre monopoly to Sharqieh (Limited), was to be taken over by the Government. He telegraphed protesting against the infringement of his concession and was thereupon allowed by Ibn Saud one month in which to return and effect an arrangement with the Minister of Finance and Muhammad Sadiq. Mr. Philby, as was recorded last month, returned in haste and negotiations took place between him, the Minister of Finance, Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co., Muhammad Sadiq and a representative of General Motors, a Mr. Daimpre, who had in the meantime also arrived here from Egypt. The result, in brief, was the virtual abrogation of the Sharqieh concession in regard to motor vehicles and the signature of a contract for the supply of fifty Chevrolet trucks with Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co., as agents, and Sadiq, as sub-agent, on terms considerably less favourable to the Government than Sharqieh (Limited) had been prepared to offer. The Umm-al-Qura of the 17th November contained an announcement in which the Sharqieh concession in regard to cars was, in effect, abrogated, though the contract in respect of tyres appears to have been maintained, probably in some modified form. Mr. Philby, who still appears to hope to import Fords for pilgrimage and private uses, though only in open competition, left hurriedly for Egypt on the 17th. His journey is said to have been taken in order to make an arrangement with Ford’s to supply cars for Government use nnd he is believed to have received an advance of money from the Government for this purpose. He was still away at the end of the month. 242. The demise of the National Bank scheme (and the Jedda-Mecca Railway project, for the fate of the latter now seems as apparent as that of the former), has seemingly not quenched all hope in this country of a national bank. The forthcoming visit by aeroplane from Cairo of Talaat Pasha Harb, Egyptian Senator and chairman of directors of the Banque Misr, though ostensibly for other purposes (see paragraph 254 below), is considered here to be not unconnected with a possible extension of the activities of the Banque Misr to this country. 243. (Reference paragraphs 168 and 194.) The Hyderabad textile industry scheme at Medina, organised by Dr. Moin-ud-Din, is receiving further supplies from India, a quantity of material, ^including twelve looms, having arrived here towards the end of the month. 244. There has been no appreciable change in the situation in Asir (reference paragraph 217) during November. Strong rumours were current locally during the first half of the month that Saudi troops had crossed the frontier in the Tihama and after heavy fighting had penetrated as far south as Medi. Both Amir Feisal and Fuad Bey Hamza categorically denied these reports to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires and the Umm-al-Qura published on the 24th an article, of obviously official inspiration, containing a similar dementi of reports alleged to have appeared also in the foreign press. Saudi military preparations are thought to be now complete, but recruiting is believed to be going on still, and on the 13th November a further batch of from 400-500 troops left Jedda by sea for Jizan. The general situation will be further treated below in connexion with Saudi relations with the Yemen (see paragraph 245). II.— Frontier Questions and Foreign Relations in Arabia. 245. There has been no detente in the relations between Ibn Sand and the Imam Yahya during the month (see paragraphs 219 and 220). In Asir (see paragraph 244 above) the general position remained much the same, save that additional reinforcements continued to be drafted south. In Najran Imamic forces still maintained a substantial hold on the district and still occupied Badr,3 its principal centre. Latterly, however, according to Fuad Bey Hamza, a sub tribe of the Beni Yam had scored a local success in driving the Yemenis out of and in occupying the Wadi Habuna, in the vicinity of Badr, a fertile and inhabited prolongation of the Wadi Najran. If the military tempo remained moderato soxtenuto it was in accordance with strict orders from Riyadh, and was due to Ibn Saud’s desire to preserve as favourable an atmosphere as possible for diplomatic exchanges, the tempo of which quickened during the month. On the 2nd November Ibn Sand replied, through Sheikh Abdullah Suleyman, to Mr. Calvert's representations of the 30th October (see paragraph 220) reiterating his desire for peace, declaring that his overtures to the Imam Yahya had been rejected and denouncing the latter’s territorial pretensions, his military aggressiveness and his intrigues to foment internal trouble in Saudi Arabia. Ibn Sand was therefore compelled to take measures for the defence of his country. A settlement, however, was necessary and he summarised his claims under four heads : (a) Surrender of the Idrisi; (b) evacuation of Najran; (c) establishment of present frontiers; and (d) reaffirmation of the present treaty (of December 1931) between the two countries. On the 12th Fuad Bey Hamza stated that Ibn Sand had received a communication from the Imam enquiring the reason for the concentration of Saudi troops on the Asir frontier, to which Ibn Saud replied two days later that it was precautionary and was due to similar concen tration in the Yemen. He took the opportunity afforded by this resumption of correspondence of reformulating his demands, his four points, and inviting the Imam's observations on them. Fuad Bey stated that an ultimatum had been prepared, together with a Green Book setting forth the Saudi case, and its issue would depend upon the nature of the Imam’sreply to Ibn Saud’slastmessage. Fuad Bey asserted Ibn Saud’s determination to avoid hostilities “ at all costs,'’ and gave what are undoubtedly two weighty reasons for this attitude—that were Ibn Saud to take the first step in a fratricidal Arab war he would assuredly forfeit the sympathy of the whole Islamic world; and that a war would prove financially disastrous to Saudi Arabia in the present difficult economic circumstances of the country. Fuad Bey also expressed misgivings as to the attitude of the Italian Government in the event of war, but later in the month he informed His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires confidentially that he had received friendly assurances from the Italians, which may help to dissipate Saudi uneasiness on that score. 246. The Imam in due course replied to Ibn Saud’s communication, accepting a proposal for a conference, but maintaining silence on the subject of the four points. This elicited a rejoinder that the omission to clarify the principal issues beforehand made a facile acceptance of a conference proposal by no means agreeable to Ibn Saud. The request for the Imam’s views was again made, and during the last ten days of November the Imam replied with no less than three telegrams, each one asking for additional information on the four points. Fuad Bey considered the questions were insincere and procrastinating, but Ibn Saud had replied fully in each case. The situation was unsatisfactory and Fuad Bey personally was inclined to believe the issue of the ultimatum could not long be delayed. In fact, he said, the tribes on the Asir frontier might anticipate an ultimatum by coming to blows at almost any day. 247. On the 18th November His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, under instructions, informed the Saudi Government by semi-official letter to Fuad Bey Hamza, of the present situation between the Aden Protectorate and the Yemen and of His Majesty’s Government’s intention to send Colonel Reilly to Sanaa to negotiate a treaty with the Imam. The Saudi Government was assured that this step, the outcome of negotiations which antedated the present Saudi-Yemeni imbroglio, implied no change in the feelings of friendship His Majesty’s Govern ment entertained for the Saudi Arab Government, but that on the contrary it was hoped that it might present an opportunity to His Majesty’s Government to exercise their influence with the Imam to reduce the dangers in the present situation between the two Arab States. On the 27th Mr. Calvert received Fuad Bey’s reply in which [bn Saud acknowledged and expressed his gratitude for these assurances. The King felt, however, that His Majesty’s Government would discover in their dealings with the Imam that he flattered only to deceive. 248. (Reference paragraph 222.) Mr. Calvert discussed with Fuad Bey the question of the exchange of ratifications of the Saudi-Transjordan Treaty on the 12th November, the first opportunity since the return of the Deputy [991 ee—2] b 24 Minister for Foreign Affairs from abroad. Fuad Bey, on this occasion, forbore to press the earlier Saudi proposal of an exchange at Jedda, and suggested that the formality should take place either in Egypt or at Jerusalem. The question was still under consideration at the end of the month. 249. The suggestion referred to at paragraph 19, that a personal meeting between the Amir Abdullah of Transjordan and Ibn Saud might prove useful, was further pursued by Mr. Calvert in conversation with Fuad Bey Hamza on the 21st November. Fuad Bey promised to refer to Ibn Saud, and on the 27th informed Mi*. Calvert that the King welcomed the suggestion, but found it difficult to fix a date earlier than the middle of March, and proposed, further, that he should proceed to the meeting, whenever it took place, by embarking at Jedda. The matter was still receiving His Majesty’s Government’s consideration at the end of the month. 250. On the 28th November two cases of robbery of camels belonging to Transjordan tribes by members of the Beni Atiya tribe encamped in the Hejaz were brought to the notice of the Saudi Government. Whilst there had been no time for an official reply before the end of the month. Fuad Bey informed His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, orally, that he understood a number of camels, which were stolen in July and August last, had already been returned. An official statement is awaited. In this connexion Fuad Bey observed that he gathered that relations between Saudi and Transjordan frontier authorities were cordial. He added that Abdullah-as-Sdayri, Governor of Tebuk, had been recently on a visit to Mecca, and had returned to his post, where his brother (probably Abdul Aziz-as-Sdayri) had acted for him, about the 28th November. 251. (Reference paragraph 200.) On the 28th November His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires addressed Fuad Bey Hamza on the subject of the frontier post of Hazim. stating that the Transjordan Government were unable jto agree that this place lay on the frontier line between the two countries, but that it was situated well’ within Transjordan territory. The Saudi military post was still in the vicinity of Hazim, but its relations with the Arab Legion post there continued to be friendly. The communication concluded with a suggestion that reciprocal arrangements might be made for the posts on either side to water at Hazim and at Isawiya in Saudi territory respectively. No reply had been received at the end of the month. HI .-—Relations with Powers outside Arabia. 252. In anticipation of the expiration on the 17th November of the Saudi moratorium in respect of their governmental debts, His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, under instruction, made oral representations to Amir Feisal on the 15th to the effect that His Majesty’s Government now expected the Saudi Government to make a serious attempt to deal with this long outstanding question. On the 18th His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, in an official note, requested the repayment of the principal of the debts in question. On the 21st Fuad Bey stated that a written reply was in preparation, but in the meantime stated verbally that, owing to the serious economic situation of the country and recent political development (alluding to the dispute with the Yemen), his Government found themselves unable at present to liquidate their indebtedness to His Majesty’s Government, although plans to that end had been drawn up earlier in the year. The official reply was duly received on the 27th, and was couched in much the same terms. The next step in the matter was receiving careful consideration at the end of the month. 253. (Reference paragraph 151.) There has been recently a decided recrudescence of complaints from British subjects and protected persons, chauffeurs of Government and other motor vehicles, that the authorities were refusing to renew driving licences to all foreign chauffeurs who failed to adopt Saudi nationality. No regulations have been published by the Saudi authorities on the subject, and as many cases of hardship are occurring owing to inadequate notice of termination of employment, Mr. Calvert on the 12th November brought the matter orally to the notice of Fuad Bey Hamza, who promised to make enquiries. He is still enquiring. 254. During the latter half of the month it became known m Jedda that the Egyptian Senator and chairman of the directors of the Banque Misr, Tala at Pasha Harb (see paragraph 242 above), was expected^ to arrive here by air early in December, from Suez, stopping en route at Tor, Wejh and Yanbu. Ono the 19th one of the staff of Misr-Airwork, a ground engineer, arrived here and a landing ground close to the town was eventually selected. With the co-operation of Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co. (Sudan) (Limited), as agents, preparations were going actively forward at the end of the month for the arrival of the plane on the 3rd December. The objects of the visit are stated to be (a) the selection of a local shipping representative for the two pilgrim ships, steamship Zamzam and steamship Nil, which, it is understood, have recently been acquired by the Egyptian Government for the conveyance of Egyptian pilgrims to and from the Hejaz; (b) the organisation of the sale of Egyptian products in this country, in particular the cotton goods produced by a subsidiary company of the Banque Misr; and {c) to explore the possibility of the Banque Misr extending its activities to this country by assuming the functions of a State Bank. Misr-Airwork, also, may not be indifferent to the opportunity of displaying their aircraft to the Saudi Government, whose guests the members of the Egyptian Mission will be during their stay in this country. 255. The Italian Charge d’Affaires, Signor Tonci, left on the 17th for two weeks’ local leave in Egypt, where he was to meet his wife, whom he proposed to bring to Jedda on his return. Shortly before his departure he informed ^ Mr. Calvert that he still had no news of the nomination of a successor to ^~ s Signor De Peppo, the late Minister. 256. (Reference paragraph 228.) M. Maigret, the French Charge d'Affaires, did not arrive, as expected, on the 12th, and had not returned from leave at the end of the month. Nothing further has been heard of his proposed excursion to Riyadh. . 257. Foreign missions in Jedda, otherwise, are slowly returning to lull complement. The Dutch Charge d Affaires returned on the 5th. His Legation has acquired a new doctor, Abdurrahman, who arrived from Java on the 17th and who will he in charge of the medical work of the Dutch Legation, both in Mecca and Jedda. Dr. Hartmann’s contract, therefore, terminates at the end of December, and it is thought he will not be long in shaking the dust of Jedda from his feet. The Persian Charge returned from leave in Syria on the 19th, hut expects to be transferred to Tehran within a few weeks, his successor, Muhammad Ali Khan Maqdam, having been already named. Habibullah Khan Hoveyda has been given the rank of Persian Minister, but this is not to take effect whilst he is still in this country. 258. • On the 10th November the Umm-al-Qura announced that diplomatic notes, relating to commerce, shipping, &amp;c., had been signed on the 7th in London by the United States Ambassador and the Saudi Arab Minister on behalf of their respective Governments. This development follows, it may be assumed, the grant ^ of the Hasa Oil Concession to an American company. 259. Telegrams of condolence and acknowledgment were exchanged between Ibn Saud and King Muhammad of Afghanistan and Amir Feisal and Ghulam Yahya, the Afghan Minister for Foreign Affairs, on the assassination of King Nadir Shah. IV.— Miscellaneous. 260 The sloop H.M.S. Penzance (Commander R. H. Bevan, R.N.), arrived in Jedda Roads on the 18th and left for Port Sudan on the 23rd November. 261. The Indian vice-consul and pilgrimage officer returned from leave on the 19th, and the Malay pilgrimage officer arrived on the 21st from Malaya, thus completing the Legation’s pilgrimage staff in readiness tor the forthcoming season. The first pilgrim ship to arrive was the steamship 1 eisander from Sourabaya, with a matter of some 680 pilgrims on board. She has since been followed by other ships. It is, however, still too early to form a reliable estimate of the size of this year’s pilgrimage. . 262. The position in regard to the manumission of slaves m November was ns follows :— On hand at the beginning of the month : None. Took refuge in November : None. Manumitted in November and repatriated : None. Locally manumitted : None. On hand at the end of the month : None. o'A COKPiaaNTlAL. Ho.

His Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, Fuad Bey LLamza, visited Jedda on several occasions during the month, and met His Majesty s Charge d Affaires on the 1st and 10th. He left for Riyadh on the 11th oge er with the French Charge d’Aflfaires, in circumstances which are described fntPr a vW raph tW } b A °u ’ ret £ rmng t0 Mecca on the 21st - He had business interviews with bir Andrew Ryan on the 28th and 29th. iniE n 5 ' J k Uad B f^ S hrot ; her ’ Taufi q Hamza, arrived here from Syria on the ^ nd i^ WaS hL 0 ?, 60, Fuad Bey informe d Mr. Calvert in conversation on that day, to find him a billet in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.

The aeroplane bringing Talaat Pasha Harb and three other members oi the Egyptian commercial mission to this country (see paragraphs 242 and 254) landed on the afternoon of the 3rd December, when Jedda turned out en masse to w itness the spectacle, i he mission were officially welcomed and were entertained as guests of the Saudi Government for the period of their stay. The aeroplane was a De Havilland Dragon, and was piloted by Mr. G. J. Mahony of Misr- Airwoik S.A.E. 1 alaat Pasha spent a busy week in Jedda and Mecca, engaged both in business conferences and in undergoing a strenuous course of Saudi hospitality. He distributed largesse broadcast in the shape of samples of goods, especially cheap textiles of Egyptian manufacture, and generously arranged for large numbers of the local inhabitants of Jedda, where the aeroplane remained during the visit, to be taken for short joy-rides over the town. As for the business objects of the visit, it was understood that the agency of the Banque Misr, as regards its purely banking business, was given for the time being to Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co., although it is believed that the bank intends in due course to establish a branch of its own in this country. Local representation of t . h ] e , r ® ce ^ tl y.P urchased Egyptian pilgrim-ships was confided to Messrs. Haji Abdullah Ah Ridha, but little precise information had. at the end of the month, come to hand regarding the activities of the mission in organising the sale of Egyptian products. It is believed that the question of the transport of pilgrims to this country by air was also raised, but the impression has been gathered that the attitude of the baudi authorities on this subject was unpromising. The mission left on the 10th by air for Yanbu, whence Talaat Pasha paid a short visit, by car, to Medina. The flight back to Egypt was resumed on the 13th and the journey successfully accomplished the same'day. i ncrea se in tonnage dues announced in July last (see paragraph 141), and which it was for a time hoped would remain unenforced is now being levied on all shipping using the Saudi ports of Jedda, Yanbu, Rabigh and Wejh. Ihe effect, in respect of Khedivial steamers, is to double the dues paid by that company, viz., from £3 gold to £6 gold at each port of call. ii Air • • en i Ce P ara g ra ph I? 3 -) The supply of water to Jedda from the vve Is at Waziriya has again suffered a setback. Water continues to arrive and the flow is considered satisfactory, but nothing has been done, and to all appear ances is likely to be done, to renew at least part of the 7 miles of conduit Irom the wells to the town. It has now been established that the pipes in the section nearer to the town are not only rotten but are so full of the accumulated tilth ot ages that the water, reasonably pure at source, arrives in the town highly contammated Europeans, therefore, and even natives of the better sort, eschew it. Meanwhile, the indefatigable Sheikh Muhammad Dehlavi and the Waziriya ( ommittee labour to extend the old Turkish conduit further back into the catch ment area in the foothills in order to increase the head of water. O n . ^ December the Umm-el-Qura announced that certain modifications in charges in respect of urgent telegraphic messages, both foreign and inland, were to be introduced m accordance with the decision of the Madrid International telegraph Conference. The date of the introduction of these charges was not indicated. 273. (Reference paragraph 214.) The economic and financial situation of the country shows no improvement. In spite of determined efforts to reduce expenditure, efforts which have involved, among other things, default in respect of their foreign and internal debts, and non-payment of the salaries of Govern ment employees, the maintenance of large forces in Asir is proving a serious dram on the Saudi Exchequer. Trade is sadly reduced—large stocks are still held Demi 1932, and pilgrims are now less numerous and seem very largely to be drawn from the poorer classes. There is a temporary buoyancy due to the approaching pilgrim season, but, unless numbers of pilgrims prove' unexpectedly large the ensuing period will witness an economic prostration in Saudi Arabia which may, indeed, be serious. 274. The military situation in Asir (reference paragraph 244) has more or less marked time during December. Reinforcements continued to be drafted south, but in smaller numbers, and it may be supposed that the bulk of Ibn Sand’s resources in men and warlike material had been mustered and strategically disposed by the end^ of the month. Some work on the lines of communication viz., the road from laif to Abha, via Qalat Bisha, has been undertaken and motor transport, it is claimed, can now traverse this length of road in five days. The3 King reviewed, as stated above, a further division of troops, estimated in the press at 10,000 men, at Riyadh on the 16th December prior to their departure for the front. The tribes' in Asir remained steady during the period. r J he uneasiness expressed by Fuad Bey that, provoked by Imamic intrigue, they might precipitate a conflict proved unfounded, but on the 10th Mr. Calvert, under instructions, expressed the hope of His Majesty’s Government that Ibn Saud, in his own interests, would make every effort to prevent the tribes from opening hostilities. . There had been, according to Fuad Bey, a few cases of individual desertions to the Yemen, chiefly from the Beni Malik and the Abadil. the general situation will be further dealt with in paragraph 275 below, in connexion with Saudi relations with the Yemen. II. — Frontier Questions and Foreign Relations in Arabia. 275. The sky between Saudi Arabia and the Temen showed some signs of clearing during the month. Correspondence between the King and the Imam, which had been going on for some time (see paragraphs 245 and 246), continued, , , O . ttt • Tk r • . 5 r-il / &gt; A lie • ~ 1 A* 4 Vi c* + f Vl£k and Fuad Bey stated to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires on the 10th that the Imam was prepared to give satisfaction over the “ minor point of the disposal of the Idrisi. As for Najran. the King had proposed, as his “ last word ” on the subject, that this district should be left as a neutral zone. No reply had since been received, but it was understood that Imamic forces were in course of being withdrawn from Najran (they had razed Badr to the ground on evacuating it) and were being concentrated at four points in the Yemen along the Asir frontier. Other major issues between Ibn Saud and the Imam Yahya were, Fuad Bey declared, still the subject of further long-range elucidation. A day or so after receiving this more encouraging account of the situation, news of a startlingly contrary nature to the effect that an outbreak of war was imminent and that Ibn Saud was proceeding in person to the front was received from a source normally well-informed. Time, however, did not confirm this more desperate view of affairs, and on the 28th December Fuad Bey, who since his last meeting with Mr. Calvert had been away in Riyadh, informed Sir Andrew Ryan that further progress towards agreement had been registered, viz., that (1) the Idrisi was to be removed to Zebid. in the I ihama of the Yemen ; (2) the Asir frontier, as it exists at present, was to be recognised by the Imam, both in respect of Asir Surati and Asir Tihama; and that a treaty in due course was to be made in affirmation of this; and (3) intrigues in Saudi Arabia by the Imam were to cease. The problem of Najran still remained unsolved—the Imam had been notified, however, that upon his acceptance or rejection of Ibn Sand’s “ last word” proposals hung the issue of peace or war. At the end of December, therefore, though the sky was perceptibly bluer, there remained one large and rather threatening cloud, which it is to be hoped the good sense of both parties will soon contrive to dissipate. Meanwhile the position on the frontier is somewhat obscure. There appears to be no foundation for rumours of actual conflict in the direction of the sea, but it has been credibly reported in one unofficial quarter that a clash took place about the middle of the month between Wahhabi forces acting without authority and the Yemenis in Najran. 276. (Reference paragraph 247.) Fuad Bey on several occasions during the month manifested great interest in the movements and progress of Colonel Reilly’s mission to Sana, His curiosity for the moment had to remain unsatisfied. . . _ . 277. The exchange of ratifications of the Saudi-Transjordan treaty took place in Cairo on the 21st December at the Continental Hotel. The Transjordan representative was Sheikh Fuad Pasha El Khatib, personal adviser to His Highness the Amir. He was accompanied by Mr. A. S. Kirkbride, assistant to the British Resident in Transjordan. The Saudi representative in Cairo. Sheikh Fauzan-el-Sabik, acted for the Saudi Arab Government. The text of the treaty was published in the M.eccn Umm-al-Qura on the 22nd December. 278. (Reference paragraph 250.) The Saudi Arab Government duly replied to Mr. Calvert’s note regarding the camels stolen by the Beni Atiya, confirming Fuad Bey’s oral statement that the animals had already been returned to the Transjordan frontier authorities on the 25th November. The Saudi authorities, on their part, also brought to the notice of the Legation on the 21st a number of [6 gg—2] ■ b 2ir 4 cases of robbery alleged to have occurred in the neighbourhood of the frontier of Transjordan. The information was passed on to the authorities concerned, but the opportunity was taken of pointing out to the Saudi Minister for Foreign Affairs that, now ratifications of the Saudi-Transjordan treaty had been exchanged, the settlement of questions of this nature by frontier officers direct should present no difficulty. Following the same principle, Sir Andrew Ryan limited himself to oral representations on the 29th December regarding a case in which it was feared that the Governor of Tebuk, having recovered camels raided from Transjordan tribesmen, might hold them pending a settlement of counter claims in respect of other raids on Saudi subjects, and was believed to have actually retained a percentage of them as “ khidma ” or “ commission on loot.” III .—Relations with Powers outside Arabia. 279. The question of the indebtedness of the Saudi Arab Government to His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Government of India was the subject of a further note addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs fay Mr. Calvert on the 9th December. The debts are two, one large and one considerably smaller, and the proposals put forward in the latest note suggested the immediate liquidation of the smaller debt, and the payment of interest at 5 per cent, on the larger debt, the repayment in full of which at an early date was also desired. It was felt that these proposals evinced on the part of His Majesty’s Government a spirit of consideration for the present financial difficulties of the Saudi Government. Fuad Bey, whom Mr. Calvert informed on the 10th of the despatch of this communication, promised to take up the question personally with Ibn Saud during his visit to Riyadh. No reply, however, had been received from the Saudi Government at the end of the month. 280. M. Maigret, the French Charge d’Affaires, returned on the 3rd December, accompanied by M. Shukri Tawil, a member of the consulate also returning from leave in Syria. The reappearance of M. Maigret in Jedda, if this ungregarious colleague can be said ever to appear in Jedda, was not for long, as he left for Riyadh by car on the 11th, accompanied by Haji Hamdi, his French- Algerian vice-consul, and was joined en route by Fuad Bey Hamza. They reached Riyadh on the morning of the 15th December, and left again on the 18th December, getting back to Jedda and Mecca respectively on the 21st December. The exceptional nature of this visit to the capital of Nejd, foreshadowed by Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman some six weeks earlier (see paragraphs 228 and 256), aroused considerable curiosity locally. Rumours to the effect that the French Government were offering the Throne of Syria to a Saudi prince, that they were engaging in active negotiations regarding the future of the ''W| Hejaz Railway or that they were intervening in the Saudi-Yemen dispute may be dismissed. There is strong reason to believe, however, that M. Maigret, despite his bland and seemingly frank assurances on his return that he had gone solely to gratify his passion for travel and to collect material for a book, did discuss matters affecting the relations of France with Ibn Saud and was allowed to go to Riyadh for that purpose as well as to achieve his more personal ambitions, which would have sufficed as an inducement to M. Maigret himself to undertake the journey, but hardly to induce Ibn Saud to authorise it. 281. The Diplomatic Body, apart from M. Maigret, pursued the inevitably even tenor of official existence here. Signor Tonci returned from local leave in Egypt, bringing his wife with him—a lady who has since maintained an almost oriental seclusion. The successor to Signor de Peppo, the Italian Minister who left in the early summer, is Signor Persico, who, however, is only to hold the rank of Charge d’Affaires. The Persian Charge left on the 15th, but his successor, Muhammad Ali Khan Maqdam, has still to arrive. The Egyptian consul was galvanised into unwonted activity during the week of Talaat Pasha Harb’s visit and, when Sir Andrew Ryan visited him afterwards, had on show in his study a very pretty display of samples. IV.— Miscellaneous. 282. Sir Andrew and Lady Ryan returned from leave in the United Kingdom on the 13th, via Port Sudan.*4 5 283. (Reference paragraph 185.) Mr. A. N. Van De Poll returned from Europe on the 10th. He intends to remain here during the Haj season, and has already spent part of his time in Mecca. Neither he nor Mr. Philby was averse to celebrating Christmas, it seemed—though most temperately. 284. End-of-year festivities in Jedda were also brightened by the appearance of the American Coon family. Dr. and Mrs. Carlton Coon, stated to represent Harvard University—he is rather young for a doctor of philosophy, and an anthropologist to boot—accompanied by Mr. Waldo Forbes, arrived on Boxing Day with the intention of conducting anthropological investigations in Saudi Arabia. They requested permission to travel across to Riyadh and pursue their researches amongst the Bedouin. Their request was not granted, and, to anticipate the Jedda report for next month, they left here for Aden on the 3rd January. Whilst recently at Sanaa they had discovered, they averred, a Yemeni of distinctly Neanderthal type. It is sad to think that owing to their departure one still lacks scientific confirmation of one’s belief that Saudi Arabia can do much better than that. 285. The pilgrimage season has now got fairly under way, a number of ships having arrived, it is still too early to estimate the probable totals, but present indications do not encourage optimism. Few prominent pilgrims have, so far as is known, arrived. Perhaps the most outstanding personage is His Highness Seyyid Sir Taimur-bin-Faisal, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., ex-Sultan of Muscat and Oman, who landed here on the 7th December and was officially welcomed by representatives of the Saudi Government, whose guest he is understood to be. 286. The I mm-al-Qura of the 15th December announced that it is hoped shortly to affix a large clock upon the Government offices in Mecca. 287. The position in regard to the manumission of slaves in December was as follows :— On hand at the beginning of the month : None. Took refuge in December : One male, one female. Manumitted in December and repatriated : One female. Locally manumitted : None. On hand at the end of the month : One male. One ex-slave man and one ex-slave woman took refuge fearing re-enslavement. The former left again of his own free will. The latter is still on hand. o{ at No. 30. (2V9/77/3) British Legation, Jedda. 3rd February 1934. I Sir, I have the honour to submit herewith the Jedda Report for January, 1934. Copies have been distributed as per the list annexed to the Report. I have the honour to be with the highest respect, Sir, Your most obedient, humble servant, ANDRE'/ RYAN. The Right Honourable, Sir John Simon, G.C.S.I., IC.C.V.O. ,J E D D A REPORT. JANUARY, 1934. Prefatory Note . It may be well to observe that the form 'SwfcdttL Arabia' is used by the Foreign Office and this Legation as the English name for Ibn Sa’ud’s dominions at the express request of the &amp;sds^L Government. The approved French form would appear to be 'Arable Soudite', as this is used on the new stamps issued for sale on the 1st January. I. INTERNAL AFFAIRS . 1. Fast and festival filled the first two-thirds of January. What with short endurable days and the excitement in the South, Ramadhan had a less deadening effect in high official circles than it sometimes has. The ensuing festival or ’Id, which began on January 17, was observed in as holiday a spirit as any English Christmas. Riy&amp;dh remained the King’s headquarters throughout the month. Hunting excursions were again reported. The quidnuncs suggested that the real object of His Majesty’s outings was to go among the tribes and ginger up their warlike spirit. The Heir Apparent went from Riyadh to ’Asir about mid-January. (See para.12 below). 2. The Amir Feysal was much concerned with affairs at Taif, where there was a concentration of troops of unknown dimensions, apparently with the double object of organising the tribal levies for war and restraining them from disorderly conduct in the town. He visited it at short notice about January 6 and came direct from Taif to Jedda on January 8 to /celebratecelebrate the King’s Accession. The ceremonial on this occasion was again confined within the discreet limits considered desirable since the ’Ulama of Nejd protested in 1931 against annual celebrations. The diplomatic representatives were asked to present their congratulations to the Governor of fTedda. They and a good many other guests attended a dinner at the Khuzaim Palace in the evening at which the Amir presided. On January 9 the Prince dined with Mr. and Mrs. Philby, now installed in the old Green Palace, in a more select company including Sir Andrew and Lady Ryan, the Netherlands Charge d*Affaires, Fuad Bey Hamza, the Minister of Finance and a few other Arab notabilities. Next evening he left for Mecca, having in the afternoon received Captain Sandford of H.M. S. 'Hastings.'' 3. Fuad Bey Hamzs a was twice available for business in Jedda. Like the Amir Feysal he arrived on January S and had conversations with His Ivtajesty’s Minister on January 9 and 10 before leaving on the latter date. He came again on January 23 but only for the inside of two days and found on his return to Mecca that he had to expedite his departure for Abha, of which more anon. 4. General business continued to be very slack. A number of cars were, however, imported, about 30 by Sharqieh Ltd., and 40 by Gellatly, Hankey &amp; Co. Two projects for the economic development of the country came suddenly into the limelight after a long period of stagnation. These are described in the following paragraphs. 5. Mr. A.Ydlibi, a naturalised British Syrian merchant in Manchester has long wished to do more for Sa’udi Arabia than merely sell her piece-goods. Although his business is comparatively small, he claims to have important backing and is prepared to take on mines, railways, indeed anything big. /HeHe has recently joined forces with the Eastern and General Syndicate Ltd. to form the Arabia Development Syndicate Ltd. y whose power of attorney he h^olds. The first objective now is to get a concession for oil in the Kuwait Neutral Zone from Ibn Sa’ud and the Sheykh of Kuwait. Ydlibi’s agent, another Syrian named T Awayni, went to Riy&amp;dh early in January and on his return came to see His Majesty’s Minister, to whom he related a gimiaia glowing tale on January 9. They had the Sheykh as good as in their pocket; the King had been most forthcoming; all he wanted was that everything should be British. Mr. ’Awayni spoke in more general terms of hopes of another concession for oil in the Northern H§jaz. 6. ’Awayni is an intimate friend of Fuad Bey Hamza; indeed the scandal-mongers said in January that these two and others had formed a little combine to supply the new clothes for the ladies of the harem on the occasion of the Id. But it was as a Minister, not as u friend or partner of Awayni, that Puad Bey consulted Sir Andrew Ryan next day as to the standing of the Syndicate, the view taken of it by His Majesty’s Government and the procedure to be followed in regard to the Sheykh of Kuwait’s interest. It was clear from Fuad Bey’s statement that the King had not committed himself but Faad Bey also represented His Majesty as being all for ensuring the British character of future enterprises. The whole delicate subject was referred to His Majesty’s Government. 7. 'Abdul Hamid Bey Shedid, who acted or professed to act for the ex-Khedive in connection with the State Bank project of last year, re-appeared in Jedda on January 9. He was not entreated on his arrival as kindly as most concession- hunters but he quickly got into touch with the Sa'xidi /GovernmentGovernment. He now purports to represent a new company formed in London under the auspices of a firm called J.S. Bartholmew and the name of the Hejaz Development Corporation Ltd. He recited a list of imposing names of magnates in the City of London p whose support it was hoped to enlist. Among them were Viscount Gdischen, Lord Glenconner and Sir E. Mountain. Shedid sought a concession similar to that of last year, with provision for a smaller initial loan to he made up to the larger figure later, and probably with more emphasis on other concessions as a quid pro quo . In this case also Puad Bey was instructed to consult Sir Andrew Ryan as to the standing of the Corporation and the prospect of support from the magnates. 8. No important developments are reported at the Jedda end in connexion with Talaat Pasha Harb's enterprises (para. 269 of the Report for December) but he is understood to be busy in Egypt and to have taken, or to be in treaty, for a house now in course of construction her4. 9. A Polish professor named Wilniewczyc arrived about January 8 and stayed a week or twn days with Mr. Philby. He is understood to have come to make a further effort in connexion with the debt of £.30,000 still outstanding in respect of arms,&amp;c., supplied to the Sa'udi Government by a Polish group in 1930 but to have discussed also the possibility of their supplying further arms,&amp;c. on a large scale. On credit,of course. 10. The financial situation of the Sa'ddi Government continues to be most precarious. Money seems to have been found to make certain payments to officials and the like in anticipation of the ’Id but salaries are still heavily in arrear and only the most urgent payments are made. ''hen on January 10 Sir Andrew Ryan followed up Mr.Calvert’s /representationsr^prv.sontations (parr..279 of the Rcoort for Dccombor) regarding the debts due to Hie : ajeety 1 s c.-overnniont and bugged Fuad ^cy to consider most seriously tho importance of satisfying their nov very moderate demands, Fuad Bey said under the ring’s instructions that, in vie-.; of the penury of the treasury, Kis Majesty xrould have to consider giving it help out of his personal resources, if Mis Majesty’s Government insisted. Did they, he caused Fuad Boy to ask, vish to put him in such a position? Considering his relations vith his Government, this attitude can only be considered disingenuous. 11. There is little to be said about tho general internal situation. Mention has been iruade above cf restlessness at Taif. The situation in ’Aslr has become but so much a part of the Sa’udi-Yemen dispute that it can/bc dealt vith bclou. That situation naturally stimulates speculation as to the future of the Sa’udi regime but the country seems to be pretty veil held. The ”Umm-al-Qura' of January 5 denied a rumour in the Egyptian press that Ibn Sa’ud intended to place parts of his dominions,e.g., the Hejaz, under the supervision of a ''neutral 1 ' Sherif,meaning, it vas suggested, one of the branch v:hose head, Sherif ’Ali Hayddr, nov resides at Beirut. The King vrould have to be very far gone before he could conceivably contemplate such a step. II. FRONTI P R PIT:SM 1 IONS and FORMIGN RMhATIONS in ARABIA. 12. The Sa’ddi-Yemen situation dominated everything else in January. The improvement recorded in para.275 of the Renort for December was not maintained. On January 9 Fuad Bey told Sir Andrew Myan that war had appeared imminent some days before but that the King had made a fresh gestureof conciliation by offering to let the question of Nnjr&amp;n stand over until it could be discussed at the conference to be held to reduce to treaty form the agreements reached on other points. The Imam's reply vas, he said, avaited. He telephoned on January 16 that this was still the position, but he confirmed a report of the previous day that the Heir Apparent had gone to the front. r /hen this conversation took place the 'Umm-al-Qura' of that morning had already published a very remarkable article, explaining that although the Imam had telegraphed on January 9 accepting the King's proposals, the gravity of the earlier situation had decided the Government to send both the Heir Apparent and the Amtr Peysal (the King's son, not his cousin the C.inC. at Abha) to the front at the head of forces from Nejd and the Hejaz. On receipt of the Imam's telegram the despatch of the Amir Peysal vas countermanded but the Heir Apparent had already left and was, according to the 'Umm-al-Qura', out of reach of communication. 13. These facts, taken in conjunction with other indications e.g., the hurried chartering of a Besse steamer to take troops to Jlzan on January 16, revealed a very definite danger of hostilities, despite the apparent narrov/lng cf the political issues. His Lajesty’s Government decided to urge on Ibn Sa’ud in express terms the dangers of the situation and the importance of avoiding an outbreak of war which might be the result of mere misunderstanding on each side of the intentions of the other. These representations were embodied in a personal letter addressed by Sir Andrew Ryan on January 23 to Ihiad Bey, who arrived in Jedda just in time to receive it. His attitude in ensuing conversations and still more the contents of his formal reply of January 28 written after reference to the King disclosed more of the true situation than had been definitely known before. The Im&amp;m had indeed agreed to a conference; so much so that Fuad /BeyBey t/as about to proceed to Abha to meet a Yemeni delegate. But, Fuad Bey explained, the Imam’s actions T^ere entirely at variance vith his words, especially his actions or those of his subordinates in the mountains forming the backbone of ’Asir Tihama, i„e. , the region north west of Sa'da inhabited by the Beni Malik, the ’Abadil and the Ahl Faifa. In conversation Fuad Bey accused the Yemenis of having actually invaded this area and having thus produced the critical situation of the early days of January. He represented the King as having- pushed patience to the extreme limit by v/ithdrawing his forces to avoid conflict. In his subsequent letter, however, the accusation vras that the Imam's intrigues, including the despatch into the area of 'Abdul Vahhab al Idrisi, had produced a revolt of the local tribes, who had expelled the Sa’udi Governors. Other intrigues among the HasSriha, &amp;c. had made it necessary to advance the Sa'udi forces to Samta. The latter mentioned the risk of incidents and hinted at the possibility of hostilitie if the Sa'udi Government were compelled to defend themselves against attack, though their intention was to await the outcome of the conference. 14. The Heir Apparent, accompanied by no less than five junior princes arrived at Abha about January 24 and took over the command. Fuad Bey left for the same destination on January 28. The Yemeni delegation was to have left San'a on January 25, but is reported as having delayed its departure owing to changes in its composition. The position at the end of the month, as seen from the north, may be summed up thus : (a) There had been no slackening in the Sa'udi military preparations. In addition to the troops embarked for Jizan on January 16, further forces had been shipped in the Government's three motor-dhows on January 30. The 'Ateyba, under their chief Ibn Rubaiy&amp;n, had marched south from Taif at some moment previous /toto January 24 5 vhen Puad Bey informed Sir Andrew Ryan of this movement. (b) There had been no fighting on the ’Aslr Tihama front and Ibn Sa’ud T/as still apparently leaving it to the local tribesmen to cope with any remaining Yemeni activity in Nejr&amp;n. The situation in the mountainous region between was very tense. It was not clear that the Imam had intervened directly in that area but he had evidently fomented trouble there. There were indications that his object was not so much to obtain possession of the country of the Beni Malik 5 &amp;c. , as to ’'neutralise'' it in the same way as it had already been proposed to neutralise Najran. (c) A conference was definitely in prospect, the outcome of which seemed likely to decide the question of peace or war, unless war should break out earlier owing to the strained situation near the frontier and the massing of forces there. 15. Nothing of importance happened in January on Ibn Sa f ud*s other frontiers. The practical arrangements for the working of the machinery contemplated in the Sa^di- Transjordan treaty had not yet been completed and occasional complaints continue to reach the Legation in connexion with minor matters. There is a press rumour that the ’Iraqi Government have appointed a Charge d ! Affaires in Jedda, but the Legation has had no confirmation of this. Flags were flown on January 26 in honour of the marriage of King Ghazi. 16. (Ref. para. 225 of last year). The ‘’Saut-al-He jaz” stated on the 8th January that the 'Iraqi Government were proposing to assign 'reasonable sums' for the opening up of the projected pilgrim-road between Najaf and Medina and that the completion of this project was expected within the next year. / III.III. RELATIONS \7ith PQT/ER3 outside ARABIA . 17. Reference is made elsewhere to conversations 'betr/eon His Majesty's Minister and Puad Bey Hamza. All intercourse \.&lt;ith the Sa’udi Government ras extremely amicable. Only two other subjects are rorthy of special mention. Sir Andrew Ryan had drawn attention on December 29 to a report from Kuwait that thr^e state prisoners at Riyadh, including Ibn Hithlayn and Ibn Ldmi, who had been surrendered to Ibn Sa’ud under certain guarantees early in 1930, had been done to death. On January 9 Fuad Bey conveyed to Sir Andrew Ryan the King's assurance that these two men were alive and added in reply to a question that the third, the once famous Sultan ibn Bujad, ■\7as also alive. It seems probable that the prisoners were in fact removed some time ago to Hofuf but when an inquiry about this was passed on to the King, he excused himself from disclosing their whereabouts. On January 24, Sir Andrew Ryan spoke to Fuad Bey about two of the ad-Dabbagh conspirators to whose presence in India the Sa’udi Government had taken exception. Me had just written to say that these two men, Tahir ad-Dabbagh and one Sadlq, had been called upon to leave India. He now added orally that they might be expected to appear next in 'Iraq, a country the access to which could not be denied them by His Majesty's Government. 18. The Netherlands Charge d’Affaires left for San'a on January 23 for the exchange of ratifications of the Netherlands Yemen Treaty, which he signed during an earlier visit last year. M. Adriaanse took with him an engineer named Flieringa, who arrived from Holland on January 14; M. Andresen, one of the managers of International Agencies Ltd., an Anglo-Dutch concern, whose principal business is the agency of the British and Dutch Blue Funnel lines; a Doctor Hartman, who has /practisedpractised medicine in Jedda for about a year, under the auspices of the Netherlands Legation, International Agencies and the Dutch Bank; and an interpreter. Although this mission is not so imposing as its composition may suggest, its members are doubtless bent cn exploring the possibilities of the Yemen for business purposes. Seme have thought that, having regard to the Sa’udi-Yemen situation, the choice of the time of their journey from Jedda to San'a on non-urgent business 'tfas unhappy. 19. The nevr Persian representative, i/ho transliterates his name Mohammed Ali Khan Mcgaddam, arrived on January 8, accompanied by a now secretary. He proves to be a full Minister. His outlook is modern and his Yrench good. He promises to be an agreeable colleague. 20. The Egyptian Consulate has been reinforced by a permanent medical officer, Dr. Aly Askar el-Ghandour. He is to preside over the medical mission sent annually to the Hejaz for the pilgrimage and to conduct a dispensary in Jedda. 21. There is little to record about the other foreign missions in Jedda. Nothing more has been heard of the business cn which the Prench Charge went to Riyadh in December. He and the Italian Charge lived in almost complete seclusion during the month. It is not known whether the latter has kept in touch with the Sa'udi Government in regard to Yemen affairs, but he has not of late sought or afforded any opportunity for discussion between him and the British Legation. Mr. Lenahan, the representative ^f the Standard Oil Company of California (para. 211 of the Report for October) is understood to aspire to the position of United States Consul. / IX. There is no definite news as to when the new Italian representative will arrive but M. Tonci hopes to get away in March.IV. MISCELLANEOUS. 22. H.M.S. ’'Hastings'’ visited Jedda from January 10 to 14. This ^as the last appearance of the present Senior Naval Officer, Captain C.S.Sandford, O.B.L., irtiose impending departure from the 3ed Sea T/ill he regretted. As the Amir Peysal rae in Jedda on the day of the arrival of 'Hastings”, His Majesty’s Minister vras able to present Captain Sandford that afternoon. 23. An American yacht, the Camargo of (?) Cincinnati, visited Jedda on January 11. Its wealthy owner, a Hr.Pleischmar was on hoard. Cne of his guests was said to he the mightiest fisher-woman in the States. But they liked Jedda so little and left so Quickly that she left neither name nor story. 24. An elderly American ornithologist called Bates, who resides near Chelmsford after a life spent in South Africa, arrived in Jedda in January with some sort of credentials from the British Museum. An enthusiastic collector and student, he promises to add considerably to what is known of hind life in the coastal region around Jedda. He is staying \:ith Hr. and Mrs. Philhy, who now have so many guests that they have arranged a mess for them in their nev; home, the C-reen palace. Mr. Philhy has realised another of his dreams hy establishing the exact longitude of Mecca. He claims to have upset the conclusions of a Royal Commission. Fortunately it was a Dutch one. 25. The ’Id was followed hy stormy weather and a cold snap which lasted some days. The temperature indoors fell more than once to about 60 F. in the early morning. This doubtless kept up the spirit of Christmas cheer. Anyhow, the European community in Jedda has gone very,very gay. Ladies are still in short supply hut they go round like anything. It has become quite difficult to compose a dinner party at a few /daysdays notice. Picnics, wireless auditions, private cinema shows and all the apparatus of occidental civilisation now compete with the rigours of life among the \ahhabis. The one American citizen, Hr. Lenahan, brings mere than one man’s quota to this social revolution. The last evening of January witnessed the first real Hot Deg party in the Hejaz. Sausage sandwiches by a moonlit sea were rated one of the happier results of the grant of the Hasa Oil Concession to an American group. 26. The outlook for the pilgrimage is rather brighter. The total of overseas pilgrims in 1934 may now be expected to exceed the figure for last year by seme thousands, unless war with the Yemen should produce an adverse effect. The numbers of pilgrim ships and pilgrims for January were as follows Prom India : 3 ships bringing a total of 2,029 pilgrims. Prom S^traits Settlements : 1 ship bringing 90 pilgrims. 27. The position in regard to the manumission of slaves in January was as follows On hand at the beginning of the month - 1 male. 2 females. 1 male. 1 female. Nil. 1 female. Nil. Took refuge in January Manumitted in January and repatriated Locally manumitted left Legation voluntarily On hand at the end of the month The slave woman who left voluntarily had fled from the household of the Amir Peysal. The case threatened to reopen the thorny question of royal slaves. After His Majesty’s Minister had discussed the case with Fuad Bey and prepared a telegram asking for approval of an arrangement for her manumission by t.ie Amir in agreement v'ith the Legation, the young woman fled, having apparently found the slave quarters in the Legation less agreeable, and life there more boring than what she was accustomed to. /CopiesCopies of this Report have 'been distributed as follows The High Commissioner, Cairo.

The month of February was singularly uneventful, except for the preparations for possible war with the Yemen, which were pursued steadily but not ostentatiously. The King remained in Neod. The Heir Apparent was at his headquarters at Khamis Musheyt not far from Abha. The Amir Feysal went off to the country north-east of Medina, ostensibly to take the air and hunt, more probably to inspect the camel parks in that area and to stimulate military preparations in the Northern Hejaz. He came to Jedda on February 18 and stayed four days. Fuad Bey Hamza reached Abhd early in the month and remained there or in that part of the world during the remainder of it. 29. There were no important developments in the economical and financial sphere but the following matters deserve mention (a) The Government displayed great eagerness to get delivery of the motor-lorries already contracted for, as soon as the importers could assemble them. They placed a new contract with Ford’s for fifty more. (b) Little was heard in Jedda about oil. Huseyn al ’Awayni (paras. 5 and 6 of the January Report) called /onon Sir Andrew Ryan on the Qth February and announced that he v/as leaving for Egypt on the following day. He hoped to meet Mr. Ydlibi there and spoke of a possible visit of the latter to Jedda when he himself came back in March. Dr. Nomland s the Assistant Chief Geologist of the Standard Oil Company of California arrived in Jedda on February 21, having travelled overland from Hasa and stayed two or three days in Riyadh. (c) The Government displayed great anxiety to receive a reply to the inquiries they had addressed to His Majesty's Government regarding the standing of the Hejaz Development Corporation Ltd. (para.7 of the January Report.) The Minister of Finance came in person to see Sir Andrew Ryan on February 7 and was given on February 11 a guarded warning against placing reliance on the Corporation. 'Abdul Hamid Bey Shedid left Jedda on February 21, having, so far as is known, settled nothing. II. FRONTIER QUESTIO NS and FOREIGN RELATIONS in ARABIA . 30. The quarrel with the Yemen remained intact. On February 2 an official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was sent post haste to Jedda to show Sir Andrev/- Ryan a number of telegrams that had passed between the King and the Imam, polite but stinging, especially the last which the King had sent two days earlier. Nevertheless both rulers were playing the game of expecting peace from the projected conference at Abhd, despite all disagreeables on the frontier. A wave of optimism swept over interested circles outside Saudi Arabia as a result of a statement circulated by the Saudi Government themselves through its representatives in London and Cairo about February 7. It described the situation in terms which were read as meaning /thatthat peace by negotiation was assured. One variant appeared in the Times of February 8 and the foreign reaction to it was best illustrated by a leading article in the same paper on February 9 headed ir Arabia Still Fortunate. ,f 31. The Minister of Finance sang a different tune :*-■ conversation with Sir Andrew Ryan on February 11 when he scouted the idea that the conference could produce a settlement. A few days later the Yemeni delegates* after some delay* reached Abba* but up to the end of the month no news had reached Jedda or even Mecca, it would appear, of the progress of the negotiations. 32. It is possible that both rulers are too averse from war to let the conference end in such a rapture as would make it unavoidable. Nevertheless, it would be rash to assume that the war cloud has been dissolved. As already stated, the Saudi military preparations continued during the month. There is some reason to believe that the position in the mountainous region over against Sa’ada was easier. There is also some reason to suppose that Ibn Saud’s attitude in regard to Najran has, if an&amp;^hing, stiffened. 33. The report that trie ’Iraqi Government had appointed a permanent Charge d*Affaires to Jedda was confirmed. Thei:: choice has fallen on one Seyyid Kamil el-Gaylani, the brother of a former Prime Minister, whose obstinacy but .. . whose abilities he is reported to share. The news that Dr. ‘Abdullah Damluji, formerly Director General of Foreign Affairs to Ibn Saud, has again become Foreign Minister in Bagdad is unlikely to impress Saudi opinion favourably. 34. On February 18 the Minister of Finance informed Sir Andrew Ryan very secretly on behalf of the King that His Majesty had heard of a plot being hatched by ex-King ’Alif Ali and the Amin of Transjordan to make common cause with the Imam against him. This kind of scare is familiar at times of stress and there is no reason to take the present one seriously. 35. On the 15th February the Legation communicated to the Minister for Foreign Affairs a new proposal by His Majesty’s Government regarding arrangements for the projected meeting between Ibn Saud and the Amir of Trans jordan. (See para,249 of the November Report.) It was hoped that the meeting might take place on board a cruiser, which Mill be passing through the Red Sea about the 19th May next and could bring the Amir and the High Commissioner to a spot outside territorial waters off \7ejh. On February 21, the Amir Feysal took the very unusual course of visiting the branch of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Jedda, for the express purpose of receiving Sir Andre?/ Ryan and explaining in the nicest possible manner the reasons which would make it impossible for Ibn Saud to proceed overland to ¥ejh. The King suggested that, unless he could be embarked in the cruiser at Jedda, the matter had better be postponed. 36. The Legation, at the instance of His Majesty’s High Commissioner for Transjordan, sent a note of explanation and apology to the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 27th February in connexion with the accidental violation of Saudi territory on February 20 by a R.A.F. aeroplane proceeding to Mudawwara, which missed its destination and flew 15 miles to the south before the mistake was realised. III. RFLA TICNS with PQY/ERS outside ARABIA. 37. The absence of Fuad Bey has almost completely /suspendedI A A. _/40. euspended diplomatic ‘business ‘between the British Legation and the Saudi Government, excepting the normal routine of notes and the discussion of some special subjects already mentioned, which have given rise to conversations with the Minister of Finance and on one occasion with the Amir Feysal. Such few other matters as it was possible to deal v/ith in personal discussion are of no general interest. 58. There is still less to be recorded as regards Other powers represented at Jedda. The Netherlands mission to the Yemen duly reached San’a and had not returned up to tne end of the month. The new 33©Psicin Minister visited Mecca and Medina for the first time but he is still awaiting the King’s arrival in the Hejaz to present his letters. IV. MISCELLANEOUS . 39. The arrival of Dr. Nomland (See para. 29(b) above) provided the occasion for an outing from Jedda ns so unusual that it is worth recording. Vith the permission and encouragement of the Minister of Finance, Mhv. Philby took a party, in which he was the only Moslem, all the way to Sharaya on the road from Mecca inland on February 20. It consisted of Mr. Lenahan, the Standard Oil of California representative in Jedda, Mr. Bates, the ornithologist (para ^ of the January Report), Mr.Gent of the Ford Co., Lady Ryan and Mrs. Philby. Owing to the late arrival of Dr. Nomland it was decided to stay the night at Sharaya, where the Minister of Finance himself appeared with tents,etc., for the party. The romantic glamour of this red-letter night in the annals of European adventure in Arabia was enhanced by the singing of the guards to the music of beaten petroleum cans.40. Mr.Bates remained in Jedda throughout the month and had by the end of it collected some 300 specimens of birds comprising nearly a hundred distinct varieties, some.extremely rare. Mr.Gent was in Jedda on the business of the Ford Co. (See para.29 above) and left on February 28. The same day there arrived Mr. D'Arcy 7/eatherbe to stay a few days at the Legation and inter r i' 1 explore the possibilities of Jedda as a place for fisn: : ... in which he is an expert. Mr.D.Black of Gellatly,Han:;:;y &amp; Co. arrived on February 14 to take over the managemcrv, of their local branch from Mr.A. J.Varner, who lias been in charge of it for some three years. 41, Mr. A. S.Calvert left Jedda on February 4 intending to visit the Transjordan desert, by arrangement between the various authorities concerned before proceeding on leave. 42. Pilgrimage prospects continue to be distinctly better. Talaat Pacha Haro (para,8 of the January report) abandoned a plan for bringing over a hundred Egyptian notables on a trial trip to Medina in February but he is still active in Egypt and it is understood that some 30C0 pilgrims may be expected from that country. There is no local confirmation of the statement in the Near East and India of February 15 that arrangements have been made to bring some of them by air. Persians are expected to be a good deal more numerous than in 1932 nnd 1S33. :he important arrivals of British pilgrim^ ships in February vw.w, 43. From India 3 ships carrying a total of 3,855 British Indians and 878 other pilgrims. From the Strait.:.

He was reported at the end of the month to he very nervous for his personal safety and to have taken unusual precautions at pilgrimage time to ensure it. The Heir Apparent remained in command in the South. His brother, the Amir Eaysal. less mobile than he had been, seems to have spent the month in Mecca. Fuad Bey Hamza was certainly at Abha and/or Khamrs Kusheyt during the greater part of the month, though he may have left for Mecca before it actually ended. His brother/ Tauflq, who acts as Private Secretary in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, was used for messages to the Legation, except on two occasions when diplomatic business was conducted with the Minister of Finance and Shcykh Yusuf Ydsin respectively. The latter had, as usual, returned from Riyadh with the King, who rarely releases him from personal attendance. 46. The Saudi/Yemen situation and the pilgrimage, which will be dealt with below, overshadowed all other interests during March, Such internal developments as are worth recording were for the most part connected with the former. Military activity continued. The Saudi motor-craft ran to and fro between Jcdda and Jiz&amp;n. A fire broke out on board one on its way south and caused according to the official account six deaths.47. The financial situation remained unchanged. Its most remarkable recent feature has been that, while money is still snort, tne Saudi Government 'sreems to have become more punctilious in the matter of payments in respect of current transactions, even vhen the goods have been delivered, ihey nave evidently realised that this is essential in cases •when- they may want to place further orders. 43. The following items of financial and economic interest may be noted :- (a) Huseyn al ’Awayni returned to Jedda on March 4 and was followed by f Abdul-Ghani Ydlibi on March 11. (Fara. 29(b) of the February Report.) Mr. Ydlibi called on His Majesty’s Minister on March 17, a compleat though unappetising Briton. He expressed the confident belief oil that he would get the Kuwait Neutral Zone/concession, so far as Ibn Sa’ud was concerned, and a concession for oil in the Northern Kejaz on March 21. lie described also an entirely nfcw Bank scheme, which he hoped to ^ut through and which he saio. nad tne approval of the Minister of Finance. The plan wag to create a bank the capital of which Tfould be subscribed equally or almost equally by a British bank and the Saudi Government. Tnis capital of i;stg. 1,000,000 would be applied to the purcnase of bar Loan, to be c-enosited in London as cover for a note issue on a sterling basis. The new bank would have privilege of issue, the note issue would be a forced currency, the bank and the Government would divide the profits and the bank would do ordinary banking business as well. If the Saudi Government would not put up their ehare of the capital, Mr.Ydlibi’s friends would lend them the money but there would be no other loan transaction. Mr. Ydlibi had not yet fixed his British bank but anticipated no difficulty as the business would be asysafe as houses. /His1 Jedda on March 21 were disappointeo^ His hopes of putting his schemes t' h in, time to leave 4tf^U^\CPhV-0IL*^ (d) Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co.(Sudan) Ltd. put through on March 31 a contract to supply the Government with 2,000,000 rounds of cartridges. This deal was projected last June (para 130 of Report for that month) but languished until at last the Ministry of Finance concluded it with all (c) Dr. Nomland of the Standard Oil Company of California (para.39 of the February Report) left for Yanbu 1 on March 22, presumably to assess the oil possibilities of the littoral north of that port. The Company imported an aeroplane into Hasa for survey work early in March. They were understood at the end of the month to have obtained, not without difficulty, permission to bring it into use. The purvey appears to be planned on an ambitious scale. (d) The Mecca press boomed the formation of an 'Arabian Export Company' with a capital of £.5,000 gold in £.5 shares. The list of subscribers includes all the best people in'KfUfcwC official and commercial life, headed by the Amir Feysal, who (e) The Banque Misr group have opened offices in Jedda, with a sign which relates only to the agency for their ships, one of which the 'Zemzem' (ex-Bibby 'Leicestershire') made three voyages with pilgrims from Egypt. The offices are Situated in a new house, in front of the Soviet Legation, to which it was formerly intended to serve as an annex. II. Frontier Questions and Fore i gn Relations in Arabia. 49. The evolution of the Saudi-Yemen situation Justified the prognostication of some that the King was only waiting /to speed. took up/xkn shares. ten /4- -Vi txto make sure of his pilgrims to force the pace with the Imam. On March Taufiq. Bey Hamza intimated to Sir Andrew hyan that the Amir Peysal was doubtful as to whether peace would he preserved. On March 22 he brought a formal message from the Amir to the effect that neither the meetings of delegates at Abha nor further direct correspondence between the King and the Imam had produced any result and that the King had ordered his troops to advance, with a view to the recovery of the portion of his territory in the faifa- Beni Malik area, which had been invaded by 1 Abdul-Vahh&amp;b al Idrisi with Yemeni forces. His Majesty had left the door open for peace, but, if no satisfactory communication were received from the Imam by the time the Heir Apparent reached the frontier, it might be necssary to cross it. Two days later Sheykh Yusuf Y&amp;sin called and at length on the course of events and the faithlessness of the Imam. On both occasions Sir Andrew Ryan urged prudence, with special reference to the Etang danger of creating an irreparable situation by entering admittedly •d£a 3 ji V territory. 50. The advance began on March 20. The Amir Sa'ud himself set cua on March 22. The King made a speech at his annual dinner for notable pilgrims that evening, in which he vigourouely defended his past proceedings and the present action, which had been thrust on him by a man whom he had regarded as his dearest friend. Everything that was published in the 1 'U mm - a 1-Qur a 1 ' next day and Sheykh Yusuf Ydsin said to Sir Andrew Ryan next day^/ seemed to indicate that the Saudi Government regarded themselves *s committed to war, but a communique published on March 30 reported that the King was still pursuing his efforts for peace in correspondence with the Imdm and added thatno armed conflict had yet occurred. This was probably true, despite rumours There was no no advance into Ka in Mecca of fighting and Saudi reverses, up to the end of the month of any Saudi yran or towards Msdi. 51. Nothing of importance was reported in connexion with Ion Sard’s relations with his other neighbours. His Majesty’s Government considered another plan for bringing about the projected meeting between Ibn Sa’ud and the Amir of Transjordan in or near Jedda, but for many reasons the whole matter is likely to be shelved indefinitely. The Saudi Government took in &amp;ood part the accidental violation of their territory by an R.A.F. aeroplane from Transjordanian apology for which was conveyed through the Legation in February (para 36 of the last Report). 62. On March 11 Sir Andrew Ryan conveyed privately to the Minister of Finance the result of inquiries regarding the alleged plot mentioned in para.34 of the last Report. It was generally reassuring. Taufiq Bey Hamza reverted to the subject on March 17 in an anxious strain but his further information was too unprecise to require any urgent action. III. Relations with Powers outside .Arabia. 53. Relations between tie Government continued to be nos For a long time Toast; the Soudi /&amp;. British Legation and the Saudi i amicable except for one breeze. Director General of Public Health has been to establish control over the Government of India medical service attached to the Legation, especially as regards the branch dispensary which is opened annually at Mecca at pilgrimage time. The Director General intensified his efforts this year to such an extent that the Legation was forced to take strong action, culminating in a direct telegram sent to the King at Riyadh on March 13. This put an end to the trouble for the tine being but the matter is /somewhatsomewhat delicate as the medical service occupies a position which would be anomalous in a less priirctive country. A possible settlement, which would give some measure of satisfaction to the Saudi Government, without impairing the freedom and utility of the service, is under consideration. 54. The new Italian Charge d’Affaires, M. Persico, (Para.281 of the Report for December) arrived in Jedda on March 25. Ke comes direct from a post in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at Rome, which he held for a year after a career mostly spent in Russia with variations in Istanoul Jedda. He does not appear to have any special knowledge of Arabian Affairs. 55. The Netherlands mission (para.38 of last Report) return from San f a on March 5. The Dutch doctor, who had practised in Jedda for a year under the auspices of the Legation and the Dutch commercial houses and had accompanied M. Adriaanse to San*a left for good a few days after their re turn. 56. It was stated in the press on March 30 that the ratifications of the Saudi-Afghan Treaty of May 5,1932 were to be exchanged next day, Afghanistan being represented by the Minister in Cairo who comes on pilgrimage every year. Confirmation is awaited. 57. The humour of the month was provided by the United States Minister in Angora, who planned a visit to Ibn Sa'dd •t Riyadh in the course of a trip to Muscat and back. The Minister reckoned without his host, who intimated politely that he was just off to the Hejaz, advanced the date of his departure, and then postponed it. again owing to urgent business until the day on which he was originally understood to have intended to start. This adds a new formula to Ibn Sa'ud’s and Cairo /repertoryrepertory of retorts courteous to gote—crashers in the interior of Arabia. 58. The Saudi Arab Government received a telegram from the Ministry of Foreign Affaiiy/s of Manchukuo on the occasion of the coronation of the new Bmperor of that state and ask^u the advice of His Majesty’s Government through both this Legation and their Minister in London, as to the attitude they should adopt. They were informed in reply that the attitude of His Majesty’s Government is determined by the Resolution adopted by the Assembly of the League of Rations on the 24th February 1933, under which members of the League were to continue not to accord recognition. 59. There is little sis else to record under this head except that the new Persian Minister held his first reception in Jedda on March 15 in honour of the Shah’s Birthday, and did it very well. Champagne flowed freely in that Moslem house but the Governor of Jedda had first been polished off at a special reception. IV. Miscellaneous . 60. H.M. S.’’Penzance” , Commander R. H. Bevan,R.N. , visited jedda, as is usual at pilgrimage time, and stayed from March 22 to 29. She took part on March 26 in the traditional regatta, now always held primarily for the pilgrimage fleet at Kaj time. Although the tradition has been interrupted, the regatta is toiovm to date from before isfc. when it used to be held on Queen Victoria's Birohday. 61. Pilgrimage Bay fell on March 25. The assemblage was not quite as large as had latterly been hoped, principally because the last shipments from India fell short of expectations. The Saudi Government estimate the total number of people of all origins gathered at 'Arafat at 60,000. 50,000 is probablythe mark. The total /numbernumber of overseas pilgrims, i,e. , those landed at Jedda and Yanbu* is officially put at 25291. This total includes whom the nuiaber of British Indians was 7012. 62. The arrangements for the pilgrimage worked normally. Health conditions were excellent. By March 31 the Saudi Government declared the pilgrimage clean and the Legation had satisfied itself that this verdict could be accepted provisionally, pending the examination of pilgrims returning northward at Tor. 63. 9 Moslem ratings of H.M.

A party of Indian motor pilgrims from Delhi tried out the overland/route travelling via Kuwait and Riyadh. They arrived two days late. The King entertained some 600 guests at the banquet already mentioned in paragraph 50 but he did not find room for the Indian Vice- Consul. 64. Captain H.C.Armstrong’s long-awaited book on Ibn Sa’ud (para.102 of the Report for May 1953) appeared in London in March under the title ’’Lord of Arabia, Ibn Sa’&amp;d. ” It does not yet seem to have reached Jedda. The reviewers at home seem to be more impressed by the pace of its staccato sentences than by its other qualities. 65. The ’’Umm-al-Qura” on February 2 and February 16 published descriptions of an ancient manuscript entitled M Hi story of Medina and its Governors” which was recently unearthed in the al-Mazhariyya Library of Medina and covered a period of some 30 years in the third century of the Hejira. pilgrims embarked in India to the number of among / 66 .66.

APRIL 1934 I. INTERNAL AFFAIR3. 67. Pon Sa’ud remained in Mecca throughout the month except for a visit to Jedda from April 11 to 13, in the course of which he twice received His Majesty’s Minister in formal audience. Re appeared to he completely composed in spite of his preoccupations in the south. He opened a new session of the Legislative Council, a 'body of which very little had been heard for some time, on April 21, 63. The Heir Apparent remained in supreme command in the inland portion of the southern front. The Amir Feysal left early on April 15 to assume the command in the littoral. Their younger brother Muhammad had already left for Riyadh to lead further troops from Nejd. A still younger brother Khalid was appointed Acting President of the Council and Acting Minister cf the Interior in place of Feysal. 69. A story of I'bn cu’ud in merry monarch mood is worth recording. It is touched for by Mr. Phi lb y who was present. While in Jedda the King was dining with his courtiers. The company included Ahmed Lanaja, a notable of Jedda, who was \ Taha s that ^ale shadow who combines the functions of Assistant Taha. The company thought he had chosen well, when the King /orderedi a . % fe m ti.: *4 E l ordered pistols for t'.vo and sale the couple to set to with them. But, to the surprise of all, it was f Ali Tana who advanced ho Idly, while Band;! a tocic cover 'behind the King 7 s chair, until His Majesty called the dual off. 70. The effective direction of foreign affairs was in the hands of the King’s political secretary Sheyhh Yusuf Yasln during the first half of the month. His official appointment as Acting Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs was notified to the foreign missions on March 21 hut on April IS Fuad Bey Hamza returned from Ahhd and on April 18 he resumed his duties at Mecca, apparently as Acting Minister. 71. The war with the Yemen overshadowed every other interest during the whole of April. No internal events of any consequence camt to the notice of the Legation nor were there any striking developments in the financial and economic domain^, The following items may he noted (a) The position in regard to the proposed oil concession for the Kuwait Neutral gone remained indeterminate throughout the month. It should have been made clearer in paragraph 48 (a) of the last report that, although Mro Ydlibi delayed somewhat his departure from Jedda, he left without having made definite arrangements in connexion with that or his ether schemes* Ho had got to the length of proposing definite financial terms for the prospective Neutral Zone concession 'but the Government have been tied up in knots over the position as regards the Sheykh of Kuwait’s joint interest and apparently &gt; over their own position in regard to the preferential right they gave last year to the Standard Oil Company of California, (b) The only known development in connexion with the possible exploitation in oil in the Northern Hejaz, in which Mr.Ydlibi and his friends arc also interested, is that Dr. Noraland, the geologist of the Standard Oil Company of California, completed his inspection of the area (See para. /43(o)( m 46(c) of the last Report) ana returned to Jedda about April 13, Ho is thought not to have been greatly impressed.

The letter was quite non-committal. (d) Messrs. C-ellatly Hanksy &amp; Company are in treaty with the Government for a new contraet to supply benzine. There has &gt;een talk for some time of Mr.Philby getting a monopoly of import for Sharqieh Limited but the fate up to date of his monopoly for cars of last year is hardly likely to encourag# the Government to entertain his proposals* (e) The Banque Kisr (para. 40(e) of last Report) ia understood to be pursuing its projects but the only outward manifestation has been the continued employment of the 'ZenZerm' A reception'was held on board on April 22 under the pcint auspices of the agents and the Egyptian Consul. uk 3 Gov mor of Jedda was the guest ®f honour and the crowd was enormous, though other shipping agents were conspicuous by their absence and the British and Italian were the only foreign representatives to attend. ry o 1 0 • Id. FRO NTIER PUESTI0K3 , and. Ibn Ca’ud has won hands doom in the first round of his war with the Imam Yahya, There are two main armies, inland in and/the :c;i littoral region. The western forces took first Haradh, where the last fort fell about fipril 15; then Medi f the defense of which was abandoned on April 25 and which the Saudia occupied next day. Various fighting is reported from this area. The Saudis claim uninterrupted success in this and appear to have enlisted the support of the tribes along the /Yemencertainly evacuated under pressure, and asked for ten days in which to fulfil the other two. On April 30 ’Abdullah al v/aastr arrived in Mecca. 74. The war has caused much scandal among outside Mosi eat and Arabs. Various groups and individuals in Egypt and elsewhere have mads belated efforts at mediation. The most active step in this direction has been the formation of a delegation consisting of Haj Amin Kusayni, President of the Supreme Moslem Council in Palestine; the well-known Arab leader of Lruze origin, the Amir Shakib ’Arslan; Kashim Bey al ’At&amp;si, a well-known Syrian politician; and Muhammad ’Ali Pasha Allouba, an Egyptian ex-Minister and lawyer. These gentlemen arrived in Jedda on April 16. They were given an official reception and have been greatly feted in Mecca but they malde no difference. They do not seem to have any intention of going on to San'a. 75. It was reported on April 27 that there were some 36 British families at Medi, where the situation still appeared to outside observers to be obscure. Arrangements were made for HMS.“Penzance' to visit the place with the sole object of reassuring and, if necessary, assisting British subjects. It was impossible to warn the Saudi government before her arrival on the evening of April 26 and the Am:tr Fey sal, who had in fact taken possession of Medi two days earlier, protested. Ibn Sa’ud felt injured by this visit, ali the more so as he had promised that British persons and interests would be fully safeguarded in any place his forces might occupy. On April 30 Sir Andrew Ryan expressed surprise at the attitude which the Amir Feysal had taken up and there ensued a friendly exchange of views and explanations between him and Fuad Bey Hamza. It is hoped that this will have cleared the air. 76. A portion of the long announced Saudi Green Book on the Saudi-Yemen dispute was published in the Mecca 'Umm-al-Qura” on April 27 and the whole book appeared on the 29th.77. For sometime past His Majesty’s Government have been considering the question of boundaries in the east of Ibn Sa’ud’s in dominions, with special reference to the positionAs regard^ to Qatar. Among the reasons which have invested this question with new importance are the grant of the Hasa oil concession to the Standard Oil Company of California last year, uncertainty as to the territorial extension given to it by the Saudi Government, the danger of the American interests finding means to establish themselves in Qatar, and the dh dubious attitude of the Shey&amp;h of Qatar, who appears, despite his treaty with His Majesty’s Government, to have come to some sort of terms with £vCu&gt;&lt; Ibn Sa’ud. His Majesty's Government decided to take their stand on treaty arrangements made between them and the Turkish Government in 1913 and 1914. The effect of these was to determine the limits of Turkish sovereignty by a 'Blue line' running down south from a point on the west coast of the Gulf of Bahrain to Parallel 20 degrees N. and a 'Violet line' thence to a place in the Aden Protectorate. It does not necessarily follow that the sovereignty of the Sheykh of Qatar and the other Trucial rulers extends up to this boundary, which must be regarded as constituting a British sphere of influence. This view, though strong in law, is unlikeuy to appeal to Ibn Sa ud, who has in fact exerted influence, if not authority,as well, east of the blue line. Any discussion with him might perhaps have been postponed, had not the United States Government made inquiries v/hich caused His Majesty’s Government to explain to them their view of the effect of the Anglo—Turkish conventions. This helped to decide the question of vdiether the views of His Majesty's Government should be conveyed to Ibn Sa’ud and afforded a means by which this could be done with the minimum appearance of provocation. On April S3 His Majesty s Minister, acting under carefully concerted instructions, addressed a note to the Saudi Government informing them as a matter of courtesyof the inquiry hy the United States Government and the reply which had been returned. 78. There has 'been no development of importance in connexion with Ihn Sa’ud's other frontiers. It may he noted, however, tnat one of the more notable visitors to the Kejaz for the pilgrimage was Fawaz ibn Sha'lan, grandson of and prospective successor to the famous Nuri of that ilk. It appears that he sat on the King’s left at the pilgrimage banquet on March 22 (See para.50 of the last Report). It has been stated in the foreign Arabic press that his tribe, the Ruwalla and other Syrian tribes have premised support to Ibn Sa’ud’^ on the northern side. 79. (Ref.para. 52). Ibn Sa’ud has, however, manifested continued perturbation over the alleged machinations of plotters in adjoining countries. On April 10 Slieykh Yusuf Ydsin brought a message from him to Gir A'iarev Ryan to the effect that he believed intrigues to be proceeding between King Ghazi, the Amir ’Abdullah, other Sn orifs, and the Amir Shakir to foment insurrection in Saudi Arabia, to which Sir Andrew Ryan was able to return a generally reassuring reply to Fuad Bey Hamza on April 21; the latter on that occasion produced a further story of activities on the part of a son of Hamid ibn Rifada near ’Aqaba, about which enquiries were still proceeding at the end of the month. III. RELATIONS with POWERS outside ARABIA. 80. Excellent relations have continued to prevail between the British Legation and the Saudi Government. The question of the Indian Government dispensary has been discussed several times and with some vigour, as Sheykh Yusuf Yasin rejected outright the possible settlement mentioned in para.53 of the last Report. A conversation with Fuad Bey Hamza on April 30 gave more promise of an eventual solution.- I 181. A Royal Air Force ’'Victoria' aeroplane made a forced landing on Saudi territory Vest of Jinnah Island on April 17 and stuck in the sand. The matter was at once notified to the Saudi Government with an apology for the unintentional violation of their territory and a request for assistance. The apology was verbally accepted and the local authorities instructed to help; the Amir of Jubail, however, although most helpful, apparently misunderstood his instructions and detained the machine for two days necessitating a further representation to the Government before he would allow it to leave. The aeroplane finally left Saudi territory and reached Bahrain on April 23; an expression of thanks for their assistance was subsequently conveyed to the Saudi Government. 82. All friendliness notwithstanding, Ibn Sa’ud has conceive some apprehension as to the state of his relations with His Majesty’s Government owing to the cumulative effect on his mind of various matters mentioned elsewhere in this Report, like the ’’Blue line/ note' mentioned in para 9 75 and some of older date, like the rapprochement between Great Britain and the Yemen. There is no foundation for his fear that the fundamental policy of friendship towards him has altered, although somewhat difficult questions call for solution. 83. The new Italian Charge d*Affaires presented his credentials at the Jedda branch of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on April 11 and was received the same morning by the King in the course of the usual series of audiences to foreign representatives. This procedure marked the difference between his status and that of the Persian Minister who presented his letters to the King the same day. 84. Developments in the south have exacerbated the suspicion with which the Saudi Government view Italian policy in the Red Sea. It is very obviously pro-Im£m though not incorrect vis-a-vis Ibn Sa’dd. On April 22 the Italian /ChargaCharge paid his first visit to Fuad Bey Hamza and urged 021 'behalf of his Government a peaceful settlement 'between the two rulers. 85. The Saudi Government are also somewhat suspicious of Egypt. The Egyptian Consul is perhaps not the ideal person to improve relations. At the 'Zemzem 1 ' reception on April 22 (See para.70(e) above), he made a speech which appeared to contrast the new perfection of the Egyptian arrangements for transporting pilgrims by sea with the still imperfect arrangements for their comfort in the Hejaz. His remarks do not seem, however, to have been as pointed as they were reported in certain Quarters to have been. 86. (Ref.para*56) The ratifications of the Saudi- Afghanistan treaty of May 5,1932 were eventually exchanged in Mecca on April 1st., and the treaty itself was published in the Mecca newspaper ’ 1 Umm-al~Qura' f of April 18. Despite the Saudi attitude towards its being signed in Mecca (see para. 211 of the Jedda report for May/June 1932) , it was found to contain an express prevision for exchange of ratifications in Mecca, and it is possible that their disinclination to stand by this clause was responsible for the delay in exchanging the ratifications. Of » There is nothing else to record in this chapter except that the Turkish Charge went on leave, greatly rejoicing, on April 6. IV. MISOELLANEOUS. 88. The Commissioner of Port Sudan and Mrs*Redfera stayed at the Legation from April 12 to 16. Mr.Redfern’s visit afforded an useful opportunity for discussing various matters of common interest, notably certain questions connected with the scheme, which has come into operation this year for the better regulation of the pilgrimage from /NigeriaHigeria. He was presented to the King on April 13. 89. The Dutch engineer Monsieur Flieringa, who was one of the recent Dutch mission to the Yemen, (Para.55 of the last Heport), outstayed his companions to make further reaearches in that country, including .a visit to Salif. Tie eventually got back to Jsdda and left for Holland on April 6. Monsieur Jacobs, who has for several years ably managed the 'Dutch Bank', left Jedda for good on April 20, giving place to a Mr.Sntrop. Mr. J.A.Smith, the managing director of Messrs. Gellatly,Hankey f s business in the Sudan visited Jedda fiom April 23 to 25. Mr.Bates, the ornithologist (Para 40 of the Report for February) left on April 25, after having collected, in collaboration with Mr. Philby, some 300 specimens of Hejazi birds, representing something like 120 species. 90. The worst dust-storm of recent years raged in and around Jedda, both by land and sea, on April 3. Ships were unable to enter the port that day and the climatic conditions ashore were horrible. Two similar but less unpleasant days followed. On the third day April 5, a great fire ravaged the African village outside the issss town, destroying in a few hours an estimated number of seme 160 compounds each containing a number of huts. fasy Dritlsh subjects and protected persons were effected but there vas no loss of British life. The Saudi Government are always unsympathetic towards these poor, though industrious, T a.ranis, as they are called. They haverO 92. It looked at one moment as though the 33 motor pilgrims from India (para. 63 of the last Report) might become a burden on the British Legation as the pilgrims ’'were very unwilling 1 ' to trust themselves again to the contractors who had let them down so badly. Steps were taken to impress on the Saudi Government the view that they should deal with the matter and it seems to have been adjusted somehow. The annual problem of ordinary destitutes remains. 93. The position as regards the manumission of slaves during the month was as follows On hand at the beginning of the month : 1 male,2 females, 1 child. Took refuge in April : 4 males, 1 female, 1 child. Manumitted in April and repatriated : Nil. Locally manumitted : Nil. Returned to Ibn Sa ? ud (See below) 1 male. On hand at the end of the month : 4 males, 3 females, 2 children. 94. A slave undoubtedly belonging to the King 1 s household took refuge on April 11. This threatened to create a very difficult question, as the King still holds that he came to an oral understanding with Sir G. Clayton in 1927, that the Legation right of manumission should not be exercised in regard to his personal slaves and soldiers, while His Majesty 1 s Government have since 1931 refused to admit the proved existence of such an understanding. On this occasion it was possible to arrange a friendly deal, V. 3. out prejudice to principles, under which the slave was returned to be manumitted by the King after an interval sufficient to save His Majesty’s face, and to be then held at the disposal of the Legation. A guarantee of good treatment during the interval was obtained. 95.

J E D D A REPORT MAY 1934. I. INTERNA L A FFAIRS . 96. Ibn Sa ? ud moved into summer quarters at Taif on May 1-2 and has since remained there. His two eldest sons remained in their commands in the south. Fuad Bey Hamza continued to he Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs in the Amir Feysal’s absence hut was indisposed for a time with the result that Sheykh Yusuf Hasin came to Jedda in his stead on May 25. 97. No important internal events were reported. The following are the only important economic items (a) The 2,000,000 rounds of ammunition bought by the Saudi Government from Go11 ably Hankey &amp; Company (Sudan) Ltd. arrived in the St rich ss, i: Gor jistan’* on May 18. (para. 48(c) of March Report) and were sent up to Mecca. Payment was completed next day. (b) About the same time Gellatly Kankey &amp; Co.(Sudan) Ltd secured for Shell the contract for supplying benzine and petroleum to the Government up to next March, (para.71(d) of • last Report). This disposes for the time being of Mr.Philby’s efforts to get a general monopoly of import for Sharqieh Ltd. payment for the Government supplies is to be made by remission of future customs duty. (c) The press announced on May 5 the formation of an #, Arabian Steam Navigation Company” to trade in the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf. It is in theory a private trading concern, but it has strong Government support, the manager being the permanent Under-Secretary in the Finance Ministry and many /prominentprominent official personages having taken shares. Th# Government have, moreover, guaranteed the Company against loss. The promoters recently hought two small vessels in Beirut, formerly under the French flag. One re-named 'El Fath M arrived in Jedda on May 21 and sailed for Qunfidha and Jizan on May 23. ' H. FRONTIER QUESTION S and FORE IGN RELATIONS in ARAB IA. 98. The fall of Medi on April 26 was followed 'by a rapid Saudi /advance along the Yemen littoral. Luhayya offered no resistance and was occupied on May 1. Hudeyda might have presented more difficulty hut the Yemeni civil administration and military forces abandoned it on April 29-30, leaving it without any government except that of certain local notables, who organised some emergency measures, including the arming of a motor lorry with machine guns. On the evening of April 30 tribesmen and the local riff-raff made hay of the governmen- stores, the treasury, &amp;c., but private property was respected. 99. On receipt of the first news brought to Kamaran by numerous refugees, HMS. 'Penzance' proceeded to Hudeyda and arrived on May 1. The night was disturbed by firing but nothing serious happened, except a small raid about sunrise which was repulsed by the local armed lorry. The landing of a party from 'Penzance' on May 2 and other measures taken by her commander, as well as/a flight round the town by three R.A.F. aeroplanes from Aden early on May 3, helped to steady the situation pending the arrival of the Saudi troops. Italian ships arrived on May 3 and 4 and also landed parties rather larger than that from 'Penzance' but less welcome. The use of Eritrean natives was criticised. 100. The first Saudi troops reached Hudeyda on May 5 and the Amir Feysal arrived next morning. Amicable relations were established betv/een him and 'Penzance' but he was less /gratifiedgratified at the presence of Italian ships and on May 7 ha rafused to allow them to bring in a larger party than before, sent to relieve the posts already on shore. 101. The first measures taken by the Saudi authorities to control the situation at Hudeyda were eminently satisfactor; They were consolidated by the despatch of the Minister of Finance, with wireless and all the elements of a regular /lunl administration, to run the town. He arrived on May 11. Kls Majesty’s Government reminded the Saudi Government that the the setting up of the new administration did not alter their position as military occupants only but there was no ground otherwise for complaint in regard to the Saudi action. Kla Majesty’s Government had at the outset arranged for two ships as well as ,? Pensance n to proceed to Aden but it was not necessary to carry out this programme. Y/hen “Penzance'’ left on May G, having re-embarked the post ashore, she was relieve* HMS.“Enterprise”. The Italians re-embarked their posts on May 10 and although they kept their ships at Hudeyda, His Majesty’s Government did not consider it necessary to replace RMS.“Enterprise” after her departure on May 19. 102. Meanwhile the Saudis had extended their occupation, •till welcome to the tribes, as far as Beyt-al-Faqih to the south and places in the foothills. The Yemenis held Zebid •nd positions in the mountains but showed during the first half of the month no signs of intending to counter-attack. The military situation on the eastern front remained, however, obscure, as the Saudi heir apparent disappeared completely from the public eye after the expulsion of the Yemenis from Najran on April 21. He might have been expected to attack Sa f ada and the official silence regarding him gave rise to rumours that he had sustained a defeat. There is no confirmation of this. /103.103. Ton Sa’ud may have had news of the Amir Sa ! u&amp; less happy than that from * bii‘3 Yemen littoral. He may have realised that in any case future military developments might he unfavourable, if the Imam were merely conserving his almost unused forces* He may have feared the disapproval, of the Arab world, whose self appointed representatives remained at his side throughout May, if he should attempt uo desrrcy the independence of the lemen* He may nave ieared, ioreign interventic i (soe 'below) in the same contingency. Whatever his reasons, he decided about Hay 12 to suspend operations on all fronts and to resume peace negetianons, on one Sw-rengoh of a telegram from the Imam promising immediate compliance with his preliminary condicions, the surrender of the Idrisis, the evacuation of the Beni Ma-ik-Yaifa area, and whe release of the hostages taken therein. 104. The Im&amp;m again failed to keep these promises but the negotiations were pursued at Taif and with such success that by May 25 a complete peace treaty had been signed. It gave Najran to Ibn Sa T ud and adopted the previous de.facto frontier as the definite boundary between the two countries elsewhere. There was only one snag. The King did not tighten up his preliminary ccncf.tions» as he had seen expected uo do and as some ad least of his advisers hoped he would do. He did not ask for an indemnity or for the at least temporary retention of Ku.deyda, but he made the entry into force of the treaty conditional on immediate compliance with his preliminary conditions as they stood. Indeed he let it oe knovvn chat, if the 7 were not complied with by May 2b, he wouio. re-Suart hostilities and had made all preparations for uhac contingency. A resui ubion of hostilities seemed inevifcaoie on the mor.xu.ng T 'T O “ v 1 Ox mo-. [ixO.J 9 ’out a communique issued that afternoon announced that the King had decided to prolong the truce ' for a few days',’ /inIn consideration of fresh assurances from the Imam that he was really getting on with the fulfilment of the conditions but that difficulties of communication had caused delay. 105. The situation was thus uncertain both from a military and a political point of view at the end of the month. Meanwhile the situation at Hudeyda was said to have deteriorated end reports to tnat effect were confirmed on and after May 25 when, as a result of the first disquieting news, HMS.'Penzance' went back there. The number of Saudi troops at Iludeyda itself had been reduced. The control over the troops as a whole seemed to have relaxed. The men were unpaid and ammunition was short. No very serious incidsntsoccured in the town but the troops gave trouble in the countryside and cases of rape were “ reducing a revulsion of feeling among the tribes. There were, moreover, reports more impressive than before of Yemeni concentrations. the main forces were at Zebid, Mentkha and ilajja. There was, it was said, to be ne general advance pending orders from ths Irndm, but other Yemeni forces held positions on an are oxtending from east of Medi to Zebid. Thera was already frequent skirmishing. On May 31 the Yemenis from HaJJa were said to be threatening Zohra, 20 miles east of men find another 1000/v/er6 said to have arrived at Zebid. It looked as though the Imaiji’s game had been to play once more for time ana as though the prolongation of the truce might no longer rest with Ibn Sa'ftd. 106. Gossip has killed off various high personages, the reports Ox whose do awn have proved to be muchbaxagGce rated. It took many days to explode the rumour, which started in Hudeyda on May 1 or 2, that the Imam was dead. His eldest son v*a another victim, though he seems to be perfectly fit and to »« the heart and soul of the war party in the Yemen. The Amir Be dd ha» also been reported dead or at any rate wounded. / 107.effect 773.3 enhanced jy friendly conversations between the grange a* Affaires and SnoylYusuf Yasfn on May 25-26. The fact remains of Italy 0 audi d-c;vc rims nt very suspicious They nivht 5±Kit'2:.trj3 3 nore so, if they knew that the ta.lio.nSj, vni„e donng only a little more than His Ma^esuy• s Govcmsonn at Hudsyda, have apparently sent at ^easL one snap an.I e -ns forces to hokha, although precise information an regard so me:. r action there is not available in Jcfua. One parsieular ground of suspicion has been the anxiety of she Italians to have an agent on shore at Hudeyda. 111. one 8audi Government have vaguer fears regarding Prance and possibly Soviet Bussia. The french also sent a sloop to Hudeyda, the upshot of foreign naval activity at the end ox the monoh being that there was one British sloop, one Italian sloop and a destroyer and one French sloop. His Majesty’s Government would have liked to promote the departure a -^ fo-rcign warships, subject to there being no ground for anticipating danger to foreign interests. The fiedlioation of this ideal has, however, been made more difficult by the latest developments described above. V . 1 -1 ^ y«.

A French journalist, M.Gaston Berthey, representing the Journal des Debats and the Journal, arrived in Jedda on /H*7 13{/?/ V. ^ May 13 and went on to Hndeyda on on about May 16. An Egyptian journal::s': naned Mahjnoud Azmy, who has connexions in London and Pams as well as Cairo and \/ho purports to represent tne inimy Lxpress, arrived the same day but went to Tail on the 14th* ine Former irsnoh Consul in Jedda, Major Ibrahim Lepui, has also been floating round in the Kejaz. 115c The dispersal of the pilgrimage continued normally and by the end of the month was nearly complete. The Legation has had to repatriate an unusually large number of Indian destitutes and is threatened with a formidable problem in connexion with the repatriation of Africans, whose numbers have been steadily growing in Mecca and Jedda in recent years and for whom there is no longer adequate employment. The problem has been aggravated by the consequences of the fire mentioned in para„90 of the last Report and by the sudden enforcement in Mecca of the regulation mentioned in para*144 of the Report for July 1933. 116o The position as regards the manumission of slaves during May was as follows • On hand at the beginning of the month - 4 males, 3 females Took reluge in May : 1 male. 2 children.

The royal slave mentioned in para,.94 of the last Report was duly manumitted by the Acting Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior on behalf of his father the King and was embarked for Jibuti via Aden under the auspices of the Legation on May 17.

Twitchell* s long cherished, gold-mining ccheneo. He is to treat with the Government for prospecting rights in various areas. 126. Ibn SrdG4 was reported early in June to h.*ve nade grants af gr&lt;*and in Jedda to the Minister &amp;f Finance and his brother, to Fuad Bey Hamza and to the gentleman w&amp;o has succeeded the late Governor of Jedldfa as local head of tfie7^ 300. the principal commercial house in the place* This appears to be a new departure and the report is confirmed as regards the merchant* Ka33i dsuf ftelnal* \fho se firm have long done much business ^Ith the Oovcmacnt and have imported teusually large Quantities of rice this year* 11 z&amp;mwn mmm m m»m &amp;u zi a ^ a . 1S7. The Yemeni concentration* described in paragraph 106 of the laat Report seemed at the end of Hay to foreshadow a possible attack on the Saudi position in the Yemen littoral. the Impression that the Irate had merely ggoule pou r nlem soutey appeared to be borne cut by a report that an Italian ohip had ,100,0 . 'arrived at Koch^ on the 25th May with el* million rounds of em unitlon as well as rifles, machine guns and stores. Severthelesa the Irate surrendered two of the thrae principal Idrtsia, vfiio reached Hudeyda on the Srd June and vhose * family ' of three hundred persons were also surrendered. It soon became apparent that the Irate had no intention of fitting and was taking definite steps to complete the fulfilment of the three conditions, to which Ibn 8a’9d had subordinated the cooing into . peace ~ force of the/treaty already alined at Taif. Although occasional ekirmiahee ware still reported from Hudeyda, the r.llita _ W- mowements presented increasingly the ap iearf rea of being px*epax»- atory to the rasumption of control by the Yoncnl* and a Saudi ewacuation partly by land but largely by aea from Hudeyda. 126. The dot ntc proceeded rapidly by a series of stages ft ifc# moct irrjportant of ^hich may b« briefly summed iip as follows* It was officially ann ounced on the 11 th J 1? n# that the Yemeni forces bad evacuated the hole of the Mountain area and that the one i. , :- .rtant luf^isi rtill outat' iiding had been sent to San*a with a view to hie being surrendered* Next day the 12th June, t if I Jir b envoy* ’Abdullah al aslr* left ifed&amp;a by sea aocoMpanicd by the nisaion of Arab Meditators* reduced in number by the earlier departure of : f uhais»ad * All Pa alia Allouba for Sgypt* A courier carrying Ibn Sard’s ratification of the peace treaty left in tne same ship* It arrived at Hudeyda late on the 14th June and vn A a*.—. ^ ^ _Oa.tixe X. th June it became known tfat the Xaffm h a accepted the treaty end had eigned hie ine rument of ratifieation, HO would Up peer to have c onto ispXa ted also the arrangements for the surrender of AbduX~!?&gt;ahhSb al-Idrtei about that time although the date for the actual handing over has not been announced. Finally on the ESSad June the rati float lone of the peaee treaty were exchanged at Huaeyda between the AmXr Feysal and »Abdullah al ^aztr. 129. After this everything proceeded smoothly up to the end of the ao^th. Various outlying places wsre formally re-delivered to the Ye&amp;enls and news of the handing over of Hudeyda iteelf ws expected at any iuament. Several parties ot Saudis left by land for the north and sofne by sea, though a - if ieulty over ships mads it iinpossible to ship more than s i,4&gt;00 small portion of the fifteen uundred troops who were to be eiah rked on the 29th Juiie. fhe Saudi Government were looking for transport for much larger numbers and were understood on the 90th June to have chartered an Indian pilgrim ship to collect the troops from Hudeyda. fhe Amtr SVysal was expected to leave on the 1st July.

On the 8th, Fuad Hamza left for Port Sudan en route for Europe and was seen off by Sir Andrew Ryan at an almost ominously deserted Quarantine Quay, 147c Two days later Sheykh 'Abdullah Suleyman returned to this port from Hudeyda, rather shaken by the voyage on the s. s, 'Ilasr 11 , a new unit in Saudi Arabia's Tiiniature mercantile marine, but jubilant at the successful issue to the trial of strength with the Yemen, He was accorded a welcome as notable as Fuad Hamza’s departure was /unhonoured.o£ ,QQO }. - 0 .-? unhonoured* 148* Sheykh Yusuf Yasin visited Jedd«. on ihe _th 19th July, vhen he met Sir Andrew Rs’-an and 'is Ka.jYsy;' Charge d f Affaires respectively* 149.

Sheykh Kamel el Qassab, an ex-Director of Education in the Hejas, well-known both here and, it is believed, in Palestine as a Saudi propagandist, arrived /herehere from Haifa towards the end of the month and proceeded at once to Taif as the rraest of Ton Sa’tid. I 06 , The Jedda Committee of Virtue, whose moviiig spirit is perhaps the young Amir, have shov/n greater activity of late. They sternly called leading members of the Indian Patna Community to account for the heresy of celebrating the ''Maulid an Nabi' (a charge the Indians denied ), and have since destroyed in pyclic a number of gramaphoneso Vhilst there may be a good deal to be said against the Jedda gramaphone, this urge to purify and regenerate, has extended to the game of football, now banned in Jedda, though not, it is understood, in Mecca, The reasons for this ve'&amp;c are rather curious if it is indeed true that local merchants persuaded the Amir to take this course, not because the game-was impure or unvirtuous, but because life is too real and too earnest for so frivolous a pastime which is so much a social leveller into the bargain, lav, . The Umm-al-Qura of the 20th stated that the Medical First Aid Association propose to establish, at their own expense, an hospital at Taif 6 This humanitarian project has, it is said, received the sanction of high authority. 158., Kehdi Bey, Chief of Police, has been appointed to take charge of the affairs of the Amirate of Taif in! m i 1,500 which was proceeding at the latter end of June (see paragraph l:-r9 of last month’s .Report) continued in the early days of July and was complete by the 6th. Contingents were drafted daily north by land and sea, the s, s« 'Alavi ,, for instance leaving on the 4th with one thousand five hundred men on board, Arnlr fey sal left by car on the 5th and Sheykh ’Abdullah Suleyman in the s, s.&gt; ’’dasr” on the 5th with the remaining troops. The parting of Saudi and Yemeni leaders is stated to have been marked by cordiality on both sides. The Imam's representative, ’Abdullah al Jarir, assumed control of the town, and of Loheya, and gave to the Senior Naval Officer, Red Sea Sloops, satisfactory assurances for the safe-guard of British lives and property. The British sloop, M.J.i. S. ’’Hastings”, thereupon left Hudeyda on the 7th, French and Italian ships leaving the same day, although one ita ian ship had sailed on the day before. Saudi troops continued to arrive in Jedda throughout the month, at first were received from Iiudeyda and later from Jiadn. They/undemonstrat ively r 'R ' ^ -i-ocal inhabitants, and. were soon whisked off in noaor tracks to Mecca and Taif, there to receive largesse m .n ' shape of rice and riyals, before they returned to their native deserts, 161. Amir Feysal made his way from Hudeyda to Jizan, vksrc he remained for the purpose, it was said, of overhauling the local administration. About the 31st ouly he left, or was on the point of leaving, for Qunfida ana. is shortly expected at Jedda. The lengthy silence that has brooded over the presence of Amir Sa’ud in Nan ran was broken on the 13th, when the Umm-al-Qura declared that he was still in that province ”supervising certain necessary arrangements : and would postpone his withdrawal until the simultaneous withdrawal of Amir Saif ul Islam /AhmadAhmad, at the time in disturbingly close proximity to the Saudi Amir, could he arranged. The feverish rumours to which this announcement gave rise were speedily dissipated by the subsequent communique, of the 27th July, reporting the withdrawal of Amir Sa’ud to Abha en route for Taif. 162, (Reference paragraph 132 of last month's Report) Seyyids Hasan and 'Abdul-'Aziz al Idrisi have been allowed to remain in Mecca, where the King is placing a palace at their disposal, Seyyid 'Abdul 'J ahhdb al Idrisi was reported to have reached Taif on the 9th to join his two relatives. 163, Amongst other actors to make their exit from this, it is to be hoped, final scene were the Peace Mission (refers: * paragraph 123 of last month's Report) who finally withdrew from San'a and left the Yemen. 164. Towards the end of the month the appointment was announced of Sheykh Ass&amp;f ibn Husayn, ex-AMir of Rus, as Amir of Hajran and all the territories of Yam. The Saudi authorities, it would appear, are now turning their attention to the administrative consolidation of these territories. 165. During the month congratulatory telegrams were addressed to Ibn Sa'ud by, among others, Ming C-hazi and Prince Omar Toussoun of Egypt, The message of the former hailed the happy consummation of the struggle with the Yemen in the Treaty of Taif as a step in the direction of unity between Arab nations. 156. On the 17th July the Trans-Jordan authorities informed the Legation that on the 2nd July an armed car patrol unwittingly crossed the Saudi-Trans-Jordan frontier P*l4ou near Haditha. They called at the Saudi post at this place The Legation expressed officially to the Saudi Arab Government the regrets of the Trans-Jordan authorities at this unintentional transgression of the frontier. /III.■ 9 n\ 1 1m III.

Sir Andrew Ryan, accoripanied by Mr. Ct. V/. Purl onge , left Jedda on the 12th and returned on the 14th July, having been given a distinguished reception and much hospitable entertainment. Ibn Sa’dd was gratified to receive the congratulations of His Majesty’s Government on the successful termination of his dispute v/ith the Imam of the Yemen, conveyed to him by Sir Andrew. He evinced a desire for closer relations with His Majesty’s Government and in a series of business talks with His Majesty’s Minister discussed a number of the major questions at present under the consideration of the two Governments. 160. Ibn Sa’ud expressed himself with great vigour on the subject of the Qatar Boundary, or the Blue Line (so. paragraph 135 of last month’s Report). The King most emphatically denied the thesis that the Turkish Government, in 1915-14, had any locus standi permitting them to dispose of his ov/n ancestral rights. Sir Andrew .Ryan hopes to discuss this question, upon his arrival in London, v/itli His Maj c sty's Government. 169. The King also adverted to the Kuwait Blockade and expressed a desire to reach a settlement on terms advantageous to each party. 170. Ibn Sa'dd displayed considerable feeling over the question of Bahrain transit dues, an attempt, as ho conceived it, to boycott the development of Has Tanuio other Saudi ports in the Persian Gulf. Sir Andrew Byon essayed to mollify the King and undertook to discuss th, question upon his arrival in London. 171. T/hilst at Taif Sir Andrew r yan received from IL 'O;; 2H+ rbn Sa'ud a special message of thanks for the helpful attitude of the Commanding Officers of the hed Coa Sloops of the Royal Navy present at Hudeyda during the roccn' troubles 0 A suitable reply uas returned and the message duly conveyed to the Officers coneernodc 172, Indeed 5 not only v/ere the relations between the British sloops and sue.: usonages as Amir Peysal and Sheykh ’Abdullah Suleynu, ' l.-mt s but so too were those established with ’ Abdul i ah al 'e-zir before t.Jh 3.

Ibn 8ahid suitably replied and the royal correspondence was duly published in the local press. It is stated that the mission was also charged with proposals regarding a commercial agreement between the two countries* 175.

Monsieur Persico went on two months leave to Lurope on the 8 th July, and the French Algerian vice-consul and a junior member in the Persian Legation, temporarily in charge, went later in the month. The latter was replaced by a youth named ? Salah ed Din Falah. V.

August v/as a month of relaxation in Taif, of royal meetings, royal shooting parties, royal marryings and divorcings. As to the former sport, Tbn Sa'tid is credited with a bag of twelve hundred gazelle in the uast two months; as to the latter, statisticians are not so precise. The King will not remove his Court to Riyadh until, it is believed, the middle of September at the earlie st. 185. Amir Sa’tid returned to Taif from Najrdn on the 10th August. He was met by his father at Rinya 021 the 8th and by Amir Feysal and other princes at Thamuda on the 9th. He was given a very festive reception and later visited Hecca for two days, where he was again feted. He left for Riyadh on the 25th, with a train of some nine other princes, issuing on his departure a message of thanhs to the country for the cordiality of its welcome. 186* Amir Feysal arrived in Jedda from Jizan on the 5th, He was clad in 'ihram' and was said to be exhausted after a rough journey overland. There was no reception and he left the same day for Mecca and Taif in haste to be in time to meet Amir Sa ? ud« He too was given a public welcome in Mecca and shared the honours at Taif with his elder brother. 187, Amir ''eysal made a later, unofficial and equally rapid visit to Jedda, in circumstances which have attracted attention to a little-advertised incident which took nlace last July uoon the arrival of a contingent of Saudi soldiers from the Yemen by sea. It arrears that IN bthe Customs officials attempted to search the soldiers’ kit for tobacco and other contraband, whereupon a fracas tool: place, an official was removed to hospital injured and some seventeen soldiers were imprisoned. r fhe dispute was settled on the 22nd August by Amir Feysal, during this lightning; visit, in favour of the Customs Administration, a decision which gave rise to some comment as Ibn Sa’ud himself o 3 believed to favour allowing his victorious sol . .y the privilege of Customs exemption on their 1 inn \ • . the v/ars. 1880 Sheykh Yusui 1 In' •.•.••as with the King throughout the month, both in Taif and in camp, save for a visit to Jedda over the 4th and 5th August in connection 'with the return of Amir Feysal.

It is thought Mr. Twitchell has not produced the argument that will always convince the Saudi Government - hard casho 193 5 The second bapiti aeroplane (see paragraph j-3.o oi lasc month s Report) was flown up to Taif early uio month and lanc.ed. there safely^ Ho further aerial activity has been observed in Jedda since 0 194, During the month several fairly lengthy lists of foreign subjects who have adopted Saudi nationality have been published in successive issues of the Umm-al-Qura (see paragraph 153(b) of the Report for July)* 195 0 Further instalments of the Coastguards Regulations, referred to at paragraph 153(c) of the Report for last month have appeared.

The sane newspaper quoted reports from a source outside this country of anti-Italian feeling in the Yemen, and on the 27th reproduced an official communique, issued from San'a, protesting, perhapa thought too indignantly, /againstagainst the wicked lies so maliciously invented.

Trans-Jordan and the grazing of camels owned by the Trans-Jordan authorities on the Saudi side of the boundary 0 20l&lt;&gt; There has been a breeze in the • Iraqi-Jaudi relationso The ’Iraq Government on the 4th August complained to the Saudi Government, through their Charge d’Affaires here, of the Saudi Charge d f Affaires in Bagdad r Ibrahim ibn Mu’ammar, on the grounds of subversive aetivii at Kerbela and Najaf, propaganda for Ton Sa’ild as King of all Arabia, and the publishing of articles in the ’Iraqi press containing disparaging remarks about Amir ’Abdullah* The note, in which this complaint eras formulated, demanded the recall of the Saudi Charge* Apparently the heavy- handed and over-emphatic manner in which this note was followed up by the ’Iraqi Charge stung Tbn Sa’ud into a heated reply* Cooler counsels led the King to seek the advice of His Majesty’s Government, Sheykh Yusuf Yas£n interviewing Mr. Calvert on the 5th, when he recounted a number of Saudi grievances against ’ Irao. and. stated his Government would be obliged to ask for the recall of the ’Iraqi representative if the ’Iraqi Government persisted in their demand for the recall of Ibrahim ibn Mu’ammar. /ItIt was later understood from Bagdad that the excess and maladroitness of the ’Iraqi Charge here were recognised by his own Government and a mollifying communication was to be addressed to the Saudi Government. Nothing further has since been heard. The breeze appears to have dropped. III. RELATIONS VITIi POV/ ERS OUTSIDE ARABIA , 202.

OCTOBER 1934 I. INTERNAL AI^PAIRS. 234. Ibn Baud remained at Riyadh during the month, where he is reported to have received congratulatory visits from large numbers of Nejdi tribesmen. Such gatherings are usual since the departure of Ibn Saud last month. Luring October h has had little outings from Taif to the Wadi Liya and 1 Ashira. Stories are not lacking that -the jealousy which is believed -c/' exist between him and Amir Saud has lately grown more marked. During the late war with the Yemen, the comparative eclipse of the ffeir Apparent in the 'wilderness of Kajran contrasted with almost floofllit victories of his younger brother in the Tirana, weysal also is said to be gaining steadily in popularity in th: Hejaz. He, the travelled member of the family, is to t.e l'e;i mind m constant contact \~ith the representatives at Jedda of foreign powers, whereas Saud lives in remote unvisited Riyadh ^here less scope ef^ers to the practitioner in the sweet uses . publicity. • J'ejd, too, is poor; t};e Kejaz, on the other hand, reaps a varying out often rich annual crop of pilgrim dues at this season, and between five and six thousand of his sub/ have been enjoying the King’s hospitality this year. 235. Amir feysal is said to have ^one distinctly gayer son and particularly into the hands of so insecure jutakr a / T ahabiahabi Fundamentalist as ,’eysal, :.e is nov' stated to have been summoned to RiySdh, some say he ^oes to be married, and is belie’ to be only putting off his departure for a fen days in order to meet I'uhammad Talaat Pasha J arb (see paragraph 240(g)). 236. Ibn Saud has retained Sheylch Yusuf Yasin '.ith him in ' ^.itl but this Ilinister’ s hand is to be seen in much of the recent legislation of a nationalist tendency, to •.hich references vill bt • made later in this Rcoort. Fuad Bey V'amza has not yet returned from his Buro ean journey (see paragraph 253), but Yauflq Lamza recently declared -chat his brother would be bach in the course o the next fe -■ weehs. If Amir ieysal goes off on a visit to Riy&amp;c. is Ilajesty's Charge d*Affaires ''ill soon have no one in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to play \'ith. 237. The Amir of Jedua (sec paragraph 214 of the Report for month) has remained at naif in the entourage of Amir I’eysal ,vith vhom he is very friendly. 3hey?d) Ali Taha has officiated here as usual during his absence. 23C. Sheylbu ’Abdullah 3ule; ; Tian (see paragraphs 215 and 216 ol ?ast month’s Re ort) after spending some time in Aneyzeh, travel];, from there about the 11 th October direct to Medina. I T e returned ' Jieoca on the 24th. passing throu ,h Jedda, where to those who net him he .had much to say about Yanbu’ , as a potential fruit-grov-j.ng district, and the Jebel Radhv/a, v.'here he had passed three days, hub less about his stay in Medina itself. This, if not strange, was disap. ointing as his visit to Medina in some minds had been associated vith the reported unrest in Teima. 239. The situation in that northern district is as indefinable as ever. Rumour is still busy but vague and seems to feed chiefl; on press reports from neighbouring countries. The Saudi authorities still seem unconcerned. 240. The folhoving items of economic or financial interest may be noted - (a) At the end of September the Saudi Government announced thei: /adhesionadhesion to the Agreements arrived at e.t the Tenth Internati Postal Conference, held in Caiio last Soring. (h) The Umn al Qura of the 20th October announced the establishment, as from the 15th October, of a fortnightly ma and passenger service by car between Necca and Riyadh. , (c) On the 23rd October, 5,000 Hauser rifles^v/ere lands# Jedda from a Strick boat. They are said to have been consi from Antwerp and imported by Khalid Al Qarqani for account ot. Saudi Government, and are stated to be old and used war-stoc.' dating from 1915, worth anything from £2 to £3 a rifle. The Khalid Al Qaro.ani should have imported this material from ar obviously German source gives some weight tp reports current that he has joined in partnership with Haji Qasim (formerly ? Machtig),the ci-devant clerk,(of Balkan origin), of the late German Consul here, Terr de Haas. This partnership is local said to be making a bid for that phoenix concession: the Je&amp;d* Mecca Railway. (d) Mr. Twitchell is reported on good authority to have secured his gold-mining concession and the agreement, it is said, has nor. been sent to the King for approval and signature. Mr. Twitchell, in the meantime, is still at Taif. (e) Mr. C.B.Cowper, the representative of Lever Rros. arrived by Khedivial on the 21st and left by the same boat on the 24th October. He did not call on the Legation and is said to have been more energetic in pushing Lever i, Pros* p French oroducts than Sunlight Soap. (f) (reference paragraph 217 of last Month’s Report). Nothing further has been heard of the Syrian-Vene/.uelan pearl fishers. They have not put in an appearance again &lt;.*’t Jedda and, it may be presumed are still at ■ ork along the coast. (g) Preparations for another visit to Jedda by air of Muhannad Talaat Pacha Karb, the Egyptian Senator and chairman of the directors of Banpue Misr, are being made for early November (see paragraph 254 of the Report for November,1933).s iC 241. The Umr.i al Qara in its issues of the 19th and 2Gth October published the Saudi Government’s 'Regulations in re spec of Landed property in the Hejaz'. These are chiefly remarkabl for the declaration that the law obtaining under previous Governments prohibiting foreigners from possessing landed prone will be maintained, that al] foreigners v, r ho may have come into possession of such property must disoose of the same, and that I contravening these regulations will be liable to certain penalti prescribed. The question has been referred by the Legation to His Majesty’s Government. vW 242. (reference paragraph^of last month’s Report). There, have been further references in the Saudi press during the month to the Overland Pilgrim route, which suggest that, while agree ne: between the Governments of Iraq and Saudi Arabia has not yet beer reached, further progress in negotiations has been made, A project to bring piUgrims from the Persian Gulf to Mecca is also reported in the press to have been given the approval of the Saudi authorities. It may have some connection with larger inland transport schemes already mentioned, but of which little fresh has been heard 4n October. 243. On the 5th October the Uznm al Qura published official 'Instructions to Chauffeurs' partly of a technical nature, which i would probably need special police to enforce. They will therefe probably be largely observed in the breach. 244. The reformist urge whicn is manifesting itself this Summer in such various legislation to which paragraphs 155, 194, 195, and 225 in previous Reports as we11 as foregoing paragraphs in this Report bear witness, \ as again displayed in the publication during the month of comprehensive regulations against infectious diseases. These regulations are in themselves, t, probably blameless and not; be discouraged, but they lac’.' reality in the almost entire absence of reasonably equip.ed hos'itals, clinics, isolation wards, laboratories, X-ray departments with qua]ifled staffs, all of which are implied in the regulations, /as jtft vill m th« ttoney and the tmowled^t to estshlleh aft even modestly ambitious health organisation. 245. The Saudi Government recently announced their adhesion to the International Sanitary Convention of 1926, but vdth reservations in respect of a number of Articles. The first oil ship for the 1933 Jiao arrived on the 3ist October (see paragraph 25C) and no change in established procedure was reported, but the attitude of the Saudi authorities is being watched and meanwhile the question as to whether this declaration with reservations constitutes a ratification has been referred to His Kaiesty’s Government. 243. A T/apiti ulane was flown from Taif to Jedaa on the 27th October and was still here at the end of the month, though it was rumoured it was intended to be used against the malcontents of Teima. 24-7, The general economic condition of the country is still as grave as last year. Hilitary expenditure has much more than of/set increased revenues from last year’s oi Igr image; officials b during the past six months have received less than one third of th salaries; trade is stagnant and old stocks unliquidated; mendicanc. is increasing and the food and clothing now being distributed as charity in the name of the King, are totally inadequate to alleviate the distress. There are certain hopes, perhaps still oremature, of a further increase in the numbers of pilgrims in 1935—it is to be hoped that such optimism is v/ell founded. 24C. The following ap 'ointments have appeared in the Saut al ::e;jaz; during the month - Shcykh Ahmad Al ’Isa us Amir of Yanbu’ ,fjheykh Kansur Ac- SSlch Ash-Sbahqa as Amir of Yfejh, Slieykh Ibrahim An-Neshmi as Amir of Turaba, and Sheykh 1'asan Ibn Duqaithar as Amir of Ranya. It., frontier Ques tions and Fo r eign Rel ations in Arabia . 249. (reference paragraph 225 of last month’s Report). ’Abdul 'Aziz Ibn Zeyd, the Saudi frontier official, left the Qarriyyatop t&lt;t ivti0 direct t^ch vith W'ft'itto nuribei* in T i'ran*~JoM«i Htfwo oroaei^li th« frontier dn Ms v.'ay to t)ie Palmyra Conference. '?he Uduh al Qura later published a short article describing the Conference, which vas to he attended cy representatives of Iraq, Syria and Saudi Arabia, as having bean arranged in order to deal with claims of the tribes of those countries in respect of loot. 250. On the 4th October the Saudi Government officially protested against an alleges violation of Saudi territory by two aeroplanes and a number of armed soldiers of the Trans- Jordan Camel Corps at Thaniya Tarif north of Jajr. The note which affirmed that the place mentioned was within Saudi Arabia, demanded indemnification and that measures be ta’.en to prevent a recurrence of so manifest an aggression. His Majesty’s Charge d’Af'aires replied on the 13th, under direction, that the Saudi •Government probably referred to the presence on the 23rd September at Ghaib inaniyya Tarais of an armoured car and t^o aircraft in tne course of their patrol on the regular Trans- Jordan frontier patrol car track, and pointed out that if so, oatrolc along this track had been carried out as a maever of routine for the past three years and that tne car track on which 3‘iaib ihaniyya Tarais is situated is not in Saudi Arabia but in Trans- Jo roan territory. No further exchange had taken place at the end of the month. 251. A further -frontier incident threatened, but in the event 'oassed off happily, about the same time when Mree Moth civil aeroplanes of the Jom’oa.y flying Club 1 ost their way flying from Baghdad to Basra and landed in the desert near Ansab ai; the western corner of the Saudi-’Iraq Neutral done. Noyal Air force machines from Basra and armoured, cars were used in prosecuting a xexxex vigorous search, which appeared almost certain to result in infraction of the Saudi frontier. The band! Government, however, played up extremely well, Amir Jeysal, to whom Ms Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires telephoned in the first olace, ordering the Amirs of Hail and cl-Hasa to send cars to hel'*' in the search and to render all possible ar 3 o ist«.nco. The lost planes were quickly and Saudi ass..stance provedUnnecessary. The affair termiaat^tT vith a polite hope on the na: of Amir Peysal that no one was injured and a perfect delude of th' from His Majesty’s Government v the Government of India, Baghdad and His Majesty’s Charge &amp;’Affaires himself. 252. About the 24th October trial raph communications were successfully exchanged between Piy&amp;dh and Basra. The occasi v'as officially noticed in an exhange of congratulatory telegrams between Nuri Pasha As-Said and Sheykh Yusuf Yasin, couched in unusually warm terms and referring to their mutual desire for dost col?.aboration, co-operation&gt; etc* III• R: NATI ONS 71 Th POIMRS OUTSIDj A PABIA . 253. (reference Paragraph 236). Iliad Bey Hamza, after terminating his visits to London (where he had conversations at the Foreign Ofi and was received by the Secretary of State), Paris and Rome, was in Stamboul at the beginning of the month, travelling thence to his home in Syria. 254, (Reference paragraph 227) The question of Legation dispensaries and cognate questions were the subject of a conversatic between Sir Andrew Ryan and Ruad Bey Hamza in London and of a further note to the Minister of Foreign Affairs by His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, elucidating certain points and re-stating the views of TT is Majesty’s Government on others. A reply from Amir Feysal on the 22nd October was uncompromising, and the matter was under further consideration at the end of the month. 255. As the outcome-.of furt. or consideration which has recently been devoted to questions arising out of the Saudi Nationality Law of 1926 (the text of ••’hich is given as an Appendix to the JedGa Report for January-February, i93i), Ur. Calvert addressed Amir Peysal on the 15th October urging that the period of grace of six months, viz. to 5th February, 1935, now allowed to claimants to foreign nationality in *• hich to prove their status, is insufficient. The op jortunity was also talien to acquaint the •-lau&amp;i Government tuat even should British Subjects or British Protected Persons b^ unaole tu 'produce documents establishing their British Status, tuey would ♦ /no tnot e«a*e ia bo j*c-..ardva \y British tuthoriUefi ec Sul^e^o or British Proteutsd Persons *pcr«ly because -clity had acquired Saudi nationality under Article X of the Saudi National! LaT7. his Ilaiesty’a Government \mld not, however, claim to afford protection to these persons v:hile they remained on Saudi territory. 250. The Saut al 'eja^ early in October published a abort para-ranh, obviously reproduced .^rom the Egyptian or Palestine press in rliich similar notices had already appeared, stating that a Japanese mission is reported to intend paying a visit to this country to select a largo number of younc men, between the ages o 20 and 25 years, of a certain education with a view to sending the to Japan co complete their studies. ‘hat appears to bo an oq.ua-: lusty 'canard' also emanated from Egypt that the Japanese Government have appointed a certain Muhammad Al Sanoaf to be choir representative in Saudi Arabia. 257.

The Saudi Oovernnent in spite of sevcial reminders, had not at the end of the month been able to supply the Legation vith their official tariff of dues. etc. for the forthcoming Taj season. vhc Ministry of finance, however, informed his Majesty’s Charge d’Af-aires caGegortcariy that the official tariff for 1935, which v/as In course of being printed as part of the Pilgrimage hrU published annually in Mecca, was exactly the sane as that of last year. British authorities concerned have been, therefore, notified to that effect. /2S0.2 GO • A Svriss lady, Ka&amp;ajnc Piquet arrived from Juropc on the 21 st and was still here at the end of the month.

Further progress has been made during the month in the formidable Task of the mass-repatriation of Y/cst African destitutes (reference paragraph 182 of the Report for July), of whom there are believed to be about 2,COO. Preparations have been made for a first contingent of 126 to leave on the 4th November for Cuakin. 2'33.

Ibn Saad continued during November to receive at Riyadh visits rrom detachments of Nej&amp;i tribesmen, of v/hom, it ie stated, there has been a daily average of about four thousand receiving the King 1 ?, bounty. This hae taken the forni of one large meal a day, for three or four days, rations of tea, sugar *nd the like, and an 'annual allowance' in cash per man. This hospitabla treatment, before the days of economic depression said to be an annual occurrence, has been resumed this year, but hao teen limited strictly to those who saw activ£ jservice in the late war. It must nevertheless have cost Ibn Saud a pretty penny and it would be interesting to know where the money cane from* The number of fresh arrivals was daily diminishing about the middle of the month and probably ceased soon after, as the King left oi a week’s hunting expedition to the west of the Laima on the SOth. 266. Amir Feyoal left for Riyadh on the 10th, leaving Gheykh 'Abdullah A1 Fadhl to act as Viceroy and President of the Council of Ministers. He was still absent from the Vs^ez at the end of the month. 267. Fuad Bey Kruno a had not returned at the end of November, but, to anticipate the Report for next month, he arrived on bhs 2nd December by Italian steamer. He T/ns mot on board by a r*eprt-B entativ? of the Amir and by the Italian Charge &lt;3'Affairea, /andand generally hi a return we a not so solitary an event ae was his departure lest July. 360, BheyKh f Abdullah Oulcyiiisn also left for Riyadh early in November, but returned within r-i few duye to Micca, where on the 26th he gave a dinner to Vuhamt-.ad falaat Harb Pa ah a (sec paragraph 275). He visited Jedda during the last four days of the month, 269, Other arrivals in Piy£dh v/ere Amir f Abdul ’Azis Ibr* liisaid, Amir of K&amp;il, who arrived from Jiis post about the 28th Octobers end KhAlid A1 Qarqani from Mecca a fev/ days later. The presence of Amir Feyeal and these various notables on visit to the TTejdi capital ...nos colo\ir to the rumour that the King har&gt; been holding an important conference. 270, (ref, para. 237 in last month’s Report) Sheykh 'Abdul 'Aziz Ibn Mu'ammar&gt; Amir of Jodda, returned on the 11th, after an absence of more than two months in Tail and Mecca. 271, The situation in the Teimu area is still obscure. It is stated that the trouble arose through the refusal of ’Abdul Aarim Ibn Rumman to pay ^zai ca t' and the raurder of some Saudi tax-collectors. Ibn Baud is said to have sent a force of 400 men under Amir Muhammad to deal with the maleontents. Another informant # recently arrived »om Riyadh, categorically dei'ied the existence of ary trouble whatsoever, either in Teim.a or elsewhere (for unconfirmed reports had represented discontent to be widespread amongst the tribee, particularly in Hasa amongst the Aj^an). .He did not appear to connect Ibn KisS’id’s visit to liySdh v/ith the situation at Tcima- on the contrary the .'jnir of H&amp;il had gore to Riyadh 'on leave and was still there'. This informant is usually reliable but it is difficult to accept go flat a contradiction of many other circumstantial reports. It is, however, equally difficult to accept the persistent stories cux-rent here of tfapiti aeroulunas, loaded up \. r ith bombs, leaving Je&amp;da for a northern destination. S272, Tneec .laudi aircraft hnva, it iB tme, shown a certain increase in activity. It still i? doubtful whether the third /ofof the three more or lens serviceable machines has yet taken the air. Two more Russians, said to be 'White 11 , named L, Kouchlaasky and V. Makovetzky, arrived from Suez on the 18th, to ^oin their compatriots Nadenhoff and Kaximoff. It is thought that of the four, t^o are pilots and two mechanics. The Russian lady referred to at paragraph £6l of last month’s Report is believed to be k'me. Nade rJioff• 273. Both Mecca newspapers published, towards the en.&lt;^ of the month two announcements by the Ministry of Defence- one setting forth conditions of entry and service in the Army for these desiring to enlist, and the second announcing the estahlielunent, as from the 16 th January, 1935, of a military School at Mecca, where candidates for commissioned rank are to take a three years’ course of training. 274. The reorgan!cation of the administration of Asir has been in progress for some little time. The principal Saudi official concerned, Reyyid Hashem, returned during the month to Jedda and was understood to be satisfied with the progress made. He stated that tribal leaders were appointed (actually very few changes being maO.c), boundaries and responsibilities fixed, and the oath of allegiance to Ton 3aud administered. 275. The visit of Talaat Uarb Pasha, foreshadowed in para. £40 (g) of last month's Report, was delayed apparently, for he did not arrive until the 22nd November. He was accompanied by Midhat Yeghen Pasha, F Chairmen of Directors of the Bancue Misr, $vmd Bey Sult&amp;n and Ismail Bey Jad Barakdt, members of the Directorate of Barque Misr, KemSl Bey Aloui, Manager of Misr Airwork, 3.A.E. and Muhammad AT Masiri Bey, Manager of the Egyptian Steam Navigation Company. /TheThe party arrived in two machines, a Dc Havill&amp;nd Dragon and a Tiger Moth and made the journey from Egypt in one day. They motored up to Mecca on the 25th, vrere entertained to dinner by Sheyhh * Abdul j. ah Suleyman, returning on the 27 th, leaving the following morning by air for Yanbu 1 * whence they motored, ae on their vioit of last year, to Medina. They were to resume their flight to Egypt on December 1st. The visit waa briefer this year than last, though the personnel was more numerous. It is yet early to ascertain the objects of the visit, but it is believed they chiefly concerned preparations for the reception of Egyptian pilgritts during the forthcoming i'iaj; the Banque Misr; and an Egyptian shipping service. Talaat Harb Pasha’s liberality to charities this year is said to have proved disappointing to the Saudis, but it is stated that the Saudi Arab Government obtained a small loan from him, probably secured upon pilgrim dues to be paid by Egyptian pilgrims coming to this country. The Pasha ras anxious to fly to Riyadh but permission was refused, a fact which may have disgruntled him somewhat. 276. ‘The S. S. ’’Mariut 5 ' and S. S. ”Manzaleh u have called in at Jedda during the montn. These two small vessels, flying the Egyptian flag, have plied, experimentally, it is reported, between Suez, Jedda and Port Sudan. The Egyptian Mission is understood to propose to follow up these trial runs, should they prove successful, with a more regular service. 277, (ref, para. 240 (d) of last Pepcrt) Mr. Twitchell returned from Talf on the 7th and left for Port Sudan on the Hth, returning here on the 14th. He stated towards the end of the month that his concession had been approved, subject to minor alterations, and he wee daily expecting to receive definite news.2*76 The Ka^af-Medina Overland route (ref, para. 242 of last Report) ie now bein^ examined jointly by Saudi and *Ira^i repreaentativeo, T/ho met recently, tha ITmra a± ^ura of the 30th announced, at Jemeyira. The survey ie to be carried out particularly between Jemayaa and .Medina. Meanwhile M. Van Da Poll confirmed that he had been approached, whilst in faif dui^ng the summer, to take up a concession for the transport of pilgrims over this route by car. He was unable to follow up the suggestion, as he had too little information on certain material points, saw a number of formidable snags in the proposals, and further, regarded the conditions imposed by the Saudi Arab Government as too onerous. 279. (ref. para. 191 and £30 of the Reports for August and September) Mr. Philby arrived from Riyadh on the l?th. At the end of the month he stated he expected two hundred and twenty motorcars to arrive here for his firm. On the 18th Mr. Reams, the Ford motor engineer who had been with Mr. Philby here before returned to Jedda and resumed work with Sharpish, Ltd. 280. The announcement by the Saudi Arab Government in regard to the International Sanitary Convention of 1926 recorded at paragraph 245 of last month’s Report did not constitute a ratification but, stated a representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in conversation with Mis Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, signified the adoption of the Convention, with certain specific reservations, as a pieces of Saudi domestic law.

Saudi-Yemen relations appear, on the whole, happy in spite of vague reports of frontier difficulties and smouldering bellicosity in some of tho Imam’s sons.

No version in Arabic has, hov-'ever, yet appeared• 292. Pain fell on the 7th fairly generally all over the Hejaz to as far north as Dhiba. In Mecca a fall of .35 inch was recorded. Further heavy rains fell on the 18th, and it is stated that Nsjd, with the exception of Riyadh itself, has had satisfactory rains, too. Temperatures in Jedda have, in c c. rL se ou e nc e , fallen app re c i c.bl y • 293. (ref. para. 271 of the Report for December, 1933). The !7aziriyeh water supply has, since it was last noticed in these Reports, proved of increasing utility to Jedda. Irnurovements have been made in the pipe-line, and the quc-J ity and quantity of the water has shown a marked difference. Not content with bringing the water to the Bidarus resevoir, the the local committee have embarked on a scheme of laying v/ate on to various quarters of the town, and, most usefully, to Quarantine Quay for the use of pilgrims. A number of workmen are giving their services, and considerable progress has already been made. It is hoped to complete the work by the end of February. Far from exhausted by their labours during the day the workmen turn for light refreshment to intensive merrymaking at night raid parade the town almost nightly with a shattering pandemonium of drums and. chorussing. 294.

A Sir, I have the honour to submit herewith the Jedda Heport for December 1934. 2. Copies have been distributed as in the list appended to the Report for January. I have the honour to be with the highest respect. Sir, Your most obedient, humble servant, ANDRE-' RYAH.295, Ibn Saud at Riy&amp;dh throughout the month. the Amir Fey sal, who was also there at its o\itset stayed, on until December 25 when he left for the Hajaz, getting back to Mecca ou December 29. Fuad Bey .namea, who, .ts stated in para. 267 of the last Report, returned from leave on December 2 visited Jedda on December 7 and liad a conversation with his Majesty’s Charge d*Affaires but three or four days later he proceeded from Mecca to Riyadh, where he remained in attendance on file •VJr.g up to the end of the month. 296. The absence of these high personages at Riyadh reduced the Ministry of Foreign affairs to a shadow and deprived the foreign representatives in Jedda of any opportunity of dealing with affairs requiring personal intercourse. The stil‘nese of the diplomatic air was intensified by the fact that the fasting month of Ramaahan, a3ways a period of slac.fue sc:, began on comber 6th. about the end of the montn by rTc arrival of the Saudi Minister in London, who left England on December 3 andarrived in on Jccfjfcber 13* .'Ic left Cairo 5 apparently by air, on Pec ember 16 and when last heard of had not to j^a^hdad* 29B. There was no news of any farther development in tne Teins area (para. S7l of last Report) or of any important happening towards the Yemen border. It v;as freely rumoured in Jedda, however, that a grave situation had arisen in the royal circle at Jciytdh with a reflex in the form of tribal unrest in the central area. 299. These reports were almost certainly much exaggerated and are not worth reproducing in detail. Their central features were that the Amir T’eysai was supposed to be an unwilling guest, ..detained in Nejd for political rencone and that an acute quarrel had occurred between the Ting and his brother Muhammad, who v/as said at one moment to have been put to death, There we :*e many variants on the current stories and other princes v/er-o named as rebels or potential rebels. So far as the Amir Fey sal is concerned, he left Piyddh, as already stated, on December fb, but the rumouriste, not to be defeated, then pu t it about that he had tarried at Shaqra, presumably to deal with the tribal unrest. 500. Mr. Phi lb y' s reaction to the rumours vras that no importance v 4 *ed be attached to tales of dissent ion in the Foyal Family but that all the bigwigs at Riyadh were u ir. a great m.udd.le *' a state of affairs which be attributes to ar e King* n failure to keep his old firm grip or the affairs of his country and to acme extent to Bis Majesty's increasing obsession /vsri thwith soo.rt, Thi a, from so ^r-CHt eii a dir. .1 re r, is si^nifj.oant and It rr^ay veil 'oe t'iat jaalovsy, e.g* between the Tieiv Apparent and hi a hrjther Feysul, and ci'iticiau'. of Ibn oaud even in hi a o-vn circle are af Tec ting ti e atachine of Gove ro:~t nt at the centre# Kr. Philhy, it ••'•ay be noted tends to ba increasingly critical of bandi ways and persons in private conversation, though he gave a fairly dreg account of Saadi atffairs in the iigyptian Gcsette of Decerfcer 11 and a vary similar article in the hear Daot of December i^O. IncideirtGlly he puts the King’s cash payments to tribesmen in the autuan (para. 866 of last Keport) at about £8000 gold per day for some two months# 301• The Saudi Air Force (para. 872 of the last Report) has continued to show soruo ac..ivity, mainly, however in the form of flights in the immediate /•sighbourhood of ledda, where tv;o .spitis, marked S.4 and 3.8 have beer, kept parked by the roadside outside the town on the inner edge of the piece of flat coast used as otn aerodrome# They were moved into hsugars on December 87. It is still uncertain whether a third machine is in working order and, if so, where it is. It is possible that the machine which crashed at Taif on July 0 (para. 162 of Report for- July) has sever beer, re-conditioued as vus aupposed but is still there. $02• T ;C pearl fishers, referred to iv. the Report for dctuber, pare# 240 (f) and earliev, who have besn ope rating u?uler the ^isnibi corccscisn ir ;-ou the vn /waterswaters of the Jted dea returned to JfcdO.a early in December. They were favourably imp reused with the potentialities of the Southern Saudi shores, but at present nheiln v&gt;o 2*5 too small and the waters over fished. / Sheytdi Vhdurrar^an ^usaibi infoiraed H.M. v Miuister that he had eo far lost money over this enterprise. It is fjtHtcd tiiat he proposes to urge Ibn Saud t£&gt; impose a close season for pearl fishing, meanwhile, the Venezuelan divers wera making p?.-eparatio)is for departure at the end of the month. •iOo. Tne Minister of finance was active in spite of Iteraadhan. he is said by some to have gone Sufi and his devotional fervour ir* Mecca has attracted attention. Ihis piety has not, however, prevented him from constantly dashing down to led6a or caused him to ■'■‘elax nia sold on the purse-strings. It vae reported aoout the Di s t that, all payments to officials had been suspended though they v/ere pro^'.isec con*«thing at the after-Romadhan festival in January and that drafts ♦ft the customs were no longer to be accepted in part payment of duty newly imported goods. Orders in tne latte;.' yen.se would apeear to i'ave bee'i issued cut chcy j'iay be of merely temporary operation. r/04. Ine negotiations- for an ogre ewe nt between the Saudi uovernnent and the mainly British group, represented by fir. Twitch ell (para. 2 r n of the last ••tv.port), via. the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate Ltd. , were compieted ori Decer.be t* 23. Pull information ie yet available r &lt;nd the agreement hen still tobe ratified. It iz understood that th5 Syndicate are to have exclusive rights; over an area comprising the Hejass and a good part of Asir* of prospecting for minerals other than oil and other liquids, gold being the principal bait* The Government are to get 15,5 of the shares in any company formed to exploit particular concessions* 5^ of any gold etc, extracted and customs duty at a flat rate of 10.1 on all material etc* imported. Mr. Twitchell left for Dgypt and. Syria on December 26th and is believed to be already making active preparations for his prospecting campaign. 305. The Minister of Finance was al so busy v/ith the scheme for sn overland pilgrim route between Najaf and Medina (para. 278 of the last Report). Sheyleh Abdulla Suleyman is not thought himself to favour* this enterprise but the Iraqi survey party visited Mecca and Jedda during December and, when they left overland for Iraq about December* 27 tb, it was understood that the matters had. been advanced sufficiently to enable the route to be used for the forthcoming pilgrimage. It is said, however, that the chargee './ill be very high. 306. Mr. Philby’o fir^, Sh&amp;roieh Ltd., have imported comething like 00 Ford vehicles under the agreement referred to in para. 279 of the last Report and earlier. The arrangements for- paying for cars supplied co transport companies seem to be satisfactory. Mr. Fhilby has an), tx) go easier with the Government themselves but he clciwsd early in the month to have extracted from £.2000 to L300C from them. The Government have taken advantage of a /savingsaving clause in the agreement with Sharqieh to buy some cars of other makes through He sera. Gellatly, Hankey and Co. 9 whose business is, however, adversely affected by the agreement. 307. The zeal of the Jedda Committee of Virtue in driving citizens from cafe to mosque at the outset of Ramadhan produced a fracas in the course of which two minions of the Committee v/ere beaten. This fracas led to the arrest of numerous citizens, as man.yyas eighty, it is said. Most of them were released within a few days, having been beaten, but a small number were kept in gaol. 308. The Umm-al-Qura took the trouble on December 21 to deny a report that a niece of Ibn Saud had arrived in Cairo and entered a school for the daughters of aherif s. II. QUESTIONS AND FOREIGN RELATIONS IN ARABIA. 309. Reference has already been made in para. 305 to the proceedings of the Iraq survey party, which visited Mecca and Jedda in connextion with the proposed Najaf-Medina pilgrim route. There is little else to record in this chapter, except that the Saudi-Yemen situation appears to be satisfactory, if stationary as regards the frontier delimitation contemplated in Article 4 of the Treaty of Taif. It is stated that the Deputy Minister of Finance, Hamad As~3uleyman, and Slieykh Khalid Al-Qarqani have been selected to serve as the Caudi Comr.issioners for this purpose but they had not left up to the end. of December. /III.,III. RELATIONS ; 'TTH POWERS OUTSIDE ARABIA. 310. By a note dated the 28th November Ton Baud offered to His Majesty The King his congratulations and good wishes on the occasion of the marriage of the Duke and Duchess of Kent. On the 2nd December ? H.M. Charge d*Affaires, by command of The King, transmitted to Ton Saud rlis Majesty's reply. 3il. 'hen Puad Bey Kamza called on H.M. Charge d*Affaires on December 7, as stated in para. 295 above, he expressed the personal view that ir. would be an excellent plan, if the proposed negotiations on questions outstanding between his Government and His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom could be conducted in Riyadh. It would probably be impractical! from a British point of view to conduct systematic negotiations there but it is possible that Sir Andrew Ryan may receive early in the New Tear an invitation to Riyadh, which was somewhat definitely fore shadowed at the tijns of his visit to Taif last July. Meanwhile, Sir Andrew Ryan has had no personal intercourse with the Saudi Government since his excepting an exchange of personal telegrams with Bey Hamza, who intimated on December 2i that he re turn, Fuad expected to be detained at Riyadh until the end of Ramadhan but hoped to sec the Minister immediately afte the ensuing festival, which should end on January 5th. 3i2. The Saudi Government agreed in a note dated December 25 to exempt from customs duty the medical supplies for the Government of India dispensary (para. 2B3 of r.ae last Report) to be imported for the forthcoming pilgrimage season, but they made it clear th«t they vrere making; the concession for this occasion /onlyonly, Y/ithout pr^ju^ice to their viev/p on the various ieeuefc# in regard to tlte medical organization attached to the htgation^ t-hich arc to be diecusaed in due course, 'hen i’Xiad Bey.iis available.

M&amp;igret profcseee to have no ambition other than that of ending his career in Jedda and wakes no secret of the fact that he owes hia retention here, v/ith a higher rank, to the good word which Ibiad Ley said for him In karie in the autumn* 'fe is about to proceed to Hudeyda cn route for Ban*a and. proposes after a britfl visit to the King of the Yemen, apparently of a compliTnentary nature, to go to Syria for a short time. 314. Major or Colonel lb rah in Lapui (para. n4 of the Heport for June) the French ex-officer who apes the Lav?rencee fond Philbys of Arabia, again arrived in Jedda about the middle of thu month. he distinguished himself on this occasion by putting it about that he had come as Belgian Consul, apparently on the ground that he once held thst position and had never loot it. The French Charge d*Affaires not unnaturally declined the request by Dupui for delivery of the Belgian Archives in the iTench Consulate, T/hich 1 us long looked after Belgian interests* There is ro present reason to suppose that the Belgian Covcrnuont arc bellind this move but Lupui hirisclf may desire an official status for the Yurtheronce of commercial schemee* Arc.olo* 'The persian Kiraster returned to Jeo.da on December 10th, smiling as hard as ever. 51.6. Tdere is no confirmation of a rumour circulated come time ago in .-gy;ot that the Japanese Croveriijnent intended to appoint a certain As-Sagqaf as Jonsul in 8aurii y^rabia. It has been denied in Tokio. IV. HISCliLIAH. .0113. 317. H.M’s hiinister and Lsdy Ryan returned to Jed da on Leeember 15th. This restored the diplomatic body proper to its full strength of eight heads of mission but the new Egyptian Consol is still awaited, the Cerman Consulate is still vacant and the Afghan representation more then nebulous. 318. The French sloop :, Vimy u arrived in Jedua on December 13th and left on the 15th. It is rorth mentioning, because it is eo unusual, that her commander and tv/o officers lunched at the British Legation on j&gt;jc ember 14, following on meetings when .Si) 1 Andrew and rad; Ryan were in Port Sudan. The 'Vimy' brought as a passenger Mrs. Bennett, wife of the Director of Customs in the Sudan, who stayed at the British Legation for three days. 319. A Dutch official from Java, M.Pfeffer, stated to be an Arabic scholar, stayed for several days a + ’*the beginning of the month with the Dutch Charge &amp;’Affaires before leaving for Dgypt. It ia believed he intends to spend sows time touring Arabic-spe&amp;king countries. 3D0.

From January 1933 the reports are sent on a monthly basis.Between July 1931 and December 1932, each report is divided into sections, numbered with Roman numerals from I to IX, as follows: Internal Affairs; Frontier Questions; Relations with States outside Arabia; Air Matters; Military Matters; Naval Matters; Pilgrimage; Slavery; and Miscellaneous. Each section is then further divided into parts relating to a particular matter or place, under a sub-heading. Some reports contain an annex.From January 1933, when the reports become monthly, they take a new format. Each is divided into sections, as follows: Internal Affairs; Frontier Questions and Foreign Relations in Arabia; Relations with Powers Outside Arabia; Miscellaneous (often containing information on slavery and the pilgrimage).Most reports are preceded by the covering letters from the Government of India, who distributed them to Political Offices in the Persian Gulf and elsewhere, and the original covering letter from the Jeddah Legation, who would send them to the Government of India and Government departments in London. From May 1933, most reports were sent directly to the Political Agent at Bahrain from Jeddah.Up until January 1933, each report began with an index giving a breakdown of the sections with references to the corresponding paragraph number.
