CABINET MIDDLE EAST (OFFICIAL) COMMITTEE Economlc and Social Development in the Middle East Technical Assistance to the i-ldclle East Note by the Joint Secretaries The attached paper, prepared by the Committee’e forking Party, in accordance with the Committee’s instructions at its meeting on January 3.^0 1930, and revised in accordance with the Committee’s instructions at its.meeting on January l?th, is circulated herewith for information. (Signed) T.E. EVANS M.M* du MERTON CABINET OFFICE, S.tf. 1 24th January, 1930*Technical ^egigtance to the Middle East The purpose of this paper is: • (1) to describe briefly the technical assistance at present available tj the Middle East Governmentsj .(2) to'outline the technical assistance to undeveloped areas v/hich is proposed under the 'Fourth Point' legislation and the United Nations Technical - Assistance Programme; (3) To indicate the extent to which such assistance may bo available for the Middle East; (4) to suggest the various fields of activity in which the new programmes might be used t) the greatest advantage; and (5) to suggest arrangements for coordinating British, American and United Nations technical assistance to the Middle East. I Technical Assistance at present available to Middle East GjVe mine nt s . (a) Fo reign expert s emp l oyed by Middl e East , Governments. . 1 . In the middle of 1949* there were estimated to bxr about 330 British exports and technicians (excluding .teacher^) employe,d by Middle East Governments (including about 150. of the technicians or foreman grade in Egypt and Iraq)# In addition, at was estimated tna-c ipu-experts of other Western nationalities are employed, the majority in Egypt and Ethiopia. It is estimated that about.20 American advisers are employed by Middle East Governments. 2. There were at that date vacancies for a further 130 experts (including 30 in .the lower grades). The.se:- vacancies included 87 for doctors and nurses, 33 far engineere, and 17 for agriculturalists. (b) Firms employed by Middle East G wornments for consultation and survey . 3. ^ number of British and American firms are employed by the Middle East Governments as consultants or for the carrying out of specific surveys. Examples are: the Overseas-Consultants Incorporated, which is' advising the Persian Government on their Seven-Year Plan; Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners, who have carried out general economic surveys for the- Governments of Syria an^ the Lebanon; - ' Messrs. Goode, Frank, Vaughan, Lee. and Gwythor, who act as consulting engineers t&gt; the Government of Iraq, and Sir Murdoch Macdonald and Partners, who are preparing an Irrigation Development Survey for the Jordan Government.( c ) ' A-e^i-efrance in eduaation and technical training providod by foreign firmg in ’the Middle ^aet, 4. Certain British and American firms, and in particular the oil companies, are carrying out an extensive programme^or assistance to the countries in which they operate in the fields of education and technical training. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company may be cited as an example. The AIOG is building and eqiiiping primary and secondary schools in the Khuzistan Province, which on completion are handed over to the Ministry of Education; it has provided laboratory equipment for the science and enginerring faculties at the University at Tehran; it provides' a large number of scholarships for Persian students to take university or technical courses in this country, (in 1948* 66 students were thus provided for); and it provides for a large number of vocational training schemes in Abadan for Persian trainees in different grades, These include short six-months’ courses for various semi skilled occupations; five year courses to train boys as low grade artisans; five year courses to train boys as high grade artisans and foremen; 3 year courses in commerce and technology of secondary school standard designed to produce stenographers, accountants, general clerks and technical junior staff itn the engineering side; and finally, a five year course for technical trainees of University standard, involving the possibility of obtaining a Company University Scholarship in the United Kingdom. 5 * (d) T he Services of the Development .Divigion of the British Middle East Office , which was established in 1946, are available to the Middle East Governments at their request. The Division includes .advisers in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, entomology, labour, health and statistics, and a co-operative adviser may shortly be appointed. (e) British Council. ^T -. -1 , -.-n-r.,- 6. The British Council arranges lecture tours to the Middle East countries of Britisn specialists in economic and social, as well as in cultural subjects. Examples are the recent visit of the Chief Nursing Adviser to the Ministry of Health to lecture in Iraq and Syria, a recent lecture tour by a senior expert in disinfestation, and a tour which has now been arranged for Sir Malcolm Darling, a senior expert on rural cooperation. The British Council also arranges for visits of Middle East experts and leading scientific and technical authorities to this country tj make contact with scientific and research institutions hero, and provides a number of scholarships‘for Middle East graduate and post graduate students to study in British Universities. At present there are nearly 40 British Council Scholars bursars from the Middle East. (There are also over 100 Egyptian students, and a considerable number of others of Middle East nationalities, studying here under their own or their Government’s‘.auspices) . The British Council also provides certain Professors for the American University at Beirut and maintains a students* hostel there. (f) Technical assistance given to the Middle East \ by British administered territories . 7. The Government of Cyprus has recently established a Forestry Training School which is designed to accommodate /Middle East...,.Miualc Liaet, ae : wall oe.Cypriot, .etuJente.

Nations Specialised agencies and the International. Bank. 11. The Food and agriculture Organisation, the World Health Organisation, and UNdSCO have established regional offices in the Middle Haste •These offices organise, periodic regional meetings of technical experts of the various Middle Last Governments-and arraiige for a^ hoc visits'of experts from headquarters to advise the Governments on special subjects. ■ The International Labour Organisation has not yet sot up a regional office but a regional ILO Conference was held at Istanbul in 1947, and the advice of ILO experts has been sought by Middle Last Governments on subjects such as ..social security and co-operation. Technical experts from the International Bank have paid visits of investigation to Iraq, Persia, digypt, Lthiopia and the Lebanon in connexion with the request of those countries for loans. advisers have been provided by the United Nations on such matters as the training of social welfare workers in Lgypt and on customs, taxation and tariff reforms in Persia, 12. The United Nations 1 Lconomic buryey Mission has made its important Interim and Final Reports.on the ^rab refugees and the economic development of the area, with particular reference to' Syria, tho Lebanon and Jordan and ^rab Palestine, and the Near-Last. Relief and Works agency being set up under the General Assembly*s resolution of December 8th to implement the .'programme of relief an^ relief works. is II Fourth Point Legislation 13. On July 1st 1949, President Truman submitted to Congress two bills for the implementation of his 'Fourth Point', one of which were concerned with the provision of /technical,,.,technical aeeistnnco to unJcvoljpcd areas. This bill states that 'it is the objective of this Act' to enable 'the Government of the United btates to participate in programmee^- in cooperation with other interested governments, for the ^ interchange of technical knowledge and skills which contribute to the balanced and integrated development of the economic resources and productive capacities of economically undeveloped areas'. In carrying out this objective, 'the participation of the United Nations', its 'related organisations, and of any other international organisation shall be sought wherever practicable'. 1 The 'technical co-operation programmes' to be carried out under the Act, 'may include but need not be limited*to economic, engineering, medical, educational, and fiscal surveys, demonstration, training and similar projects that serve the purpose of promoting the development of economical resources and productive capacities of under-developed areas'. ii revised edition of this bill, known as the 'International Development Act of 1950', was introduced in the House Foreign affairs Committee on January 18th 1U* It is understood that the United States have in mind a total world expenditure of about #86 million for the first year of extended technical assistance activities - both through the United Nations and direct U*S. assistance. They envisage that United States and other United Nations countries should produce about #57 million, and that the countries receiving assistance should put up about #29 million to meet local expenses. To this end the President has included in the U.S# 1950 - 1 budget #45 million for the United States proportion. It is understood that from #10 - 15 millions of these funds may be placed at the disposal of the United Nations and the Specialised Agencies as the United States contribution to their Expanded Programme of Technical Assistance (see below), A further #10 million is already committed under existing programmes. The balance will be administered by the United States Government under bilateral arrangements. 15* The recent conference of Heads of United States Mesions in the Middle East recommended that an Institute of • Near Bast affairs should be set up in Washington, under the auspices of the State Department, to administer and co-ordinate American assistance to the area. Ill United Nations 1 Technical Assistance 16. The General Assembly has now approved the Expanded Programme of Technical Assistance, drawn up by the Economic and Social Council in August 1949* This programme will provide services which 'should aim at increased productivity of material and human resources and a wide and equitable distribution of the benefits of such increased productivity, so as to contribute to the realisation of higher standards of living for the entire populations'. This involves technical assistance for the promotion of social improvements as well as for economic development. The programme will be carried out by the United Nations and the Specialised Agencies and will be coordinated by a Technical Assistance Board, composed of the Secretariats of the United Nations and Specialised agencies, and by a Special Governmental Committee of Economic and Social Council. It will be financed by contributions from governments, which will be fixed at a Conference to be held in March - April 1950. The first year /programmemm programme will probably be of the order of ^1^ - 20 million. The greater part of the funds will be allocated to the administering agencies according to the following fixed percentages: United Nations I # L * 0 # -1 F.A.Q. 2% ••• UNESCO ICAO ‘ W. H • 0 # ; 22? 0 17# Vve understand that U.S# Government have worked out roughly the way in.-which the ‘total programme of #86 million might bo spent, both between areas receiving assistance, and fields in which the assistance might bo given. Those estimates provide for 3*1$ of the total, going .to the Near East and Africa (#26,3 million); for 21$ of the total to be spent on agriculture and forestry, 23$ on health, 1CX on education, and % on industry, IV Amount of Assistance of U,S, ,'Point Four ' and United Nations Technical assistance Programmes likely tj be available to the i',diddle East. 18. The State Department originally estimated that the sum available for Arab countries under Fourth Point bilateral assistance might amount to #5 million during the first year. Jn a subsequent paper, they have estimated the total sum Which might be available from the United States and United Nations programmes for the 'Near East' (i,e, Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Iraq, Israel, Egypt, Sudan, Saudi Arabia and Yemen) ae ,2 million, plus an unspecified proportion of a total of # 3*£ to be divided between the Near East and Africa, Of the #.2 million, #3.0 million (3S$) might be spent on experts, #1,3 million ( 23 ^) on trainees, and #0,9 million (17') on equipment. The State Dex^artment have also pointed out that as regards exports conditions would almost inevitably be attached to the bilateral assistance which would necessitate itt feeing spent on salaries of American experts, perhaps with latitude small proportion to'be spoilt dh salaries of experts wh ; were O^lionals of the countries benefit ting. In the case of the UttitQd Programme, the experts' provided could of course, be tifcawn from any country contributing to the programme.Limit !hr Factors The following aro the limiting factors which likely to apply to those tvvo'programmes: (a) The recent Istanbul Conference of U.S. Heals of Missions in the Millie Lust rccommendol that Point Four assistance shoull in no case be furnishel to Millie Last Governments'except at their specific request, ana until evidence ha_* been proluced that it would be effectively utilised. In the United Nations 1 technical assistance programme, similar conditions are specifically laid lown, (b) The State Department hav^ pointed out that there may be considerable difficulty in recruiting, in the U*S,A. the full numbers of experts required to . meet; the bilateral Fourth Point programme. As regards the.U.N, programme, there is likely to be a similar difficulty in finding experts from the United Kingdom . or Commonwealth.VI* Suggested Fields of Activity for the Expanded Technical Assistance Programnes in the Middle East. ( a ) Research and Technical Survey by Foreign Experts in the Middle 5as£7 20. The United Nations Economic Survey Mission, in Appendix III to their Pinal Report, have summarised the •'research and technical survey requirements in the Middle ' ast countries' and, after pointing out the vital importance of basing development on sound surveys has stated that: 'Unfortunately the Middle East countrie-s (except Israel) have a serious lack of the type of trained specialists competent to conduct such surveys, not only on the higher but on the technical foreman level .It is clear that, although more use can be made of local ability, most of the technicians to survey, plan and design the development schemes essential for the Middle East, will have to come from abroad',. The fields in which such technical assistance is required can for convenience be divided into six major heads: (1) Study of the basic elements land and water, and their products, the basic industry of agriculture in its broad sense; (2) Examination of the second primary source- mineral wealth; • (3) Survey of industrial development; (4) Technical advice on transportation; (3) Study of economic and administrative implications of development; 21. The following list of the subjects in which technical surveys and advice are generally required is the.n given: Cartography, Soil Chemistry, Erosion Control, Land tenure. Meteorology, Hydraulic engineering. Geology, Irrigation, Engineering, Hydroelectric engineering. Crop Husbandry, • Horticulture, Animal Husbandry, Plant Pathology, Veterinary Science, Entomology, Agricultural Economy, Fisheries, Forestry, Industry and industrial processing -.e.g. chemistry» sugar refining, textile production, dairy processing, etc., . ' Transport: -Ports, Rivers, Railways, Roads, Airfields, Statistics, Administration, Finance, Labour, Health, Education, Police. 22. We suggest that survey and research generally may conveniently be divided into the following categories: (i) Initial exploratory surveys in the fields of both economic 'and social development to examine in general terms what is required and draw up general plans of .action. These have hitherto been carried out by private firms of Consultants (e.g, the Gibb Surveys of Syria and Lebanon, the Overseas Consultants* Survey of Persia); by specially appointed Commissions (e.g. the Haigh Irrigation Commission in Iraq, the recent United Nations Survey Mission); and by individuals, including the Advisers to the Development Division of the British Middle East Office. (ii) Detailed surveys of specific capital development projects. These are normally carried out by firmsfirms of Consultants. Examples are: the surveys of the Aleppo Water Scheme and Latakia port in Syria carried out by Sir A. Gibb and Partners; the survey which Sir Murdoc|i Macdonald and Partners are making of the Jordan Valley pj^ject; and Phase II of the O.C.I. operations in Persia. The survey of the Li tan i River, recommended in the Final Report of the United Nations Survey Mission, appears to fall within this cate-gory* (iii) Preparation of detailed specifications for capital development projects. These normally would be carried out by firms of Consultants. An example is the specifications .-for the Wadi Tharthar flood control scheme in IraQ, which are . now being prepared by the Consulting Engineers to the Iraq Government. (iv) Long-term appointments involving the organisation and carrying out of rest: arch-schemes, including the training of staff; and the planning and supervision of executive action, in e.g. such fields as forestry and fishery development, transport, labour, health etc. , The 150 vacancies which at present exist under the Middle East Governments, referred in Section I above, fall mainly into this category. (v) Brief surveys in highly specialised particular subjects - e.g* water surveys in former Italian Colonies. 23. The experience of the Development Division of the British Middle East Office has shown the value of establishing on a regional basis a small team of permanent experts - who are men of considerable standing and seniority in their particular fields - to meet the need at (i)* This arrangement ensures that experts are available at short notice, provides for the possibility of follow-up visits (which are most .important,) and also enables the experts to acquire, and .‘make continuous use of, a background of knov/ledge of and contacts in the countries concerned* 24. The Development Division at present includes ? 'senior experts (see paragraph 5 above). The services of these experts are in increasing demand by the Middle East 'Governments (and in two cases we have-been obliged to second them to the Governments for periods of six months to a year,) and the work is becoming more than they can at present deal with. It is hoped, therefore, to expand the Division by the inclusion of, perhaps, half a dozen more experts. Nevertheless, a team of this size will not be adequate to meet the anticipated demands of the area as development plans mature. There might therefore be advantage if the United States Government attached a- similar team of experts to the proposed 'Institute of Near Eastern Affairs.' The members of this team, and of the Development Division of the B.M.E.O. , would then, according to the requirements of the surveys^ either visit the countries concerned singly, or grouped together in teams, whose members might be drawn from both offices, and to which ad hoc experts might also be attached. 25 . It is understood that the United Nations technical assistance may also be partly provided in the form of teams of experts drawn from the Specialised Agencies, If desirable. United Nations experts might also be attached to the Anglo-American teams referred to above. fallfall mainly into this category. 26* The need at (ii) and (iii) can probably best continue tv oe met from firms of consultants, appointed by the Governments concerned. In some cases, however the surveys at (ii) might be undertaken by experts from the British or American teams. 27. The need at (iv) must normally involve the appointment of experts to work with or for the Middle East Governments concerned for a considerable period - e.g. 3-5 years. It seems to us important to ensure that the Point Pour and United Nations Technical assistance programmes are planned t^ run for at least a period of'5 years. (Tiie Fourth Point Bill provides that the President may ’’enter into contracts.... that may run for not to exceed 3 years in any one case.”) It is also suggested that it would be desirable that the Governments concerned should be invited to make at least a partial contribution to the salaries of these experts, in order to ensure that the Governments- concerned give due value to their advice. Finally, we attach' great importance to . ensuring that these experts are provided with the scientific and technical equipment (e.g. laboratories) necessary to enable them to carry out their work effectively.' : (Two senior exports in Iraq, an anaesthetist;and a plant pathologist, have recently resigned owing to lack of proper equipment for their work). In this connexion, it is suggested that for certain subjects regional laboratories might be established, e.g. at Beirut and Cairo, where the results of the experts’ field work could be analysed. 28. The need at (v) can be met by special visits from ad hoc experts, either from the pool or from outside sources. (b) Education and Technical Training 29. The State Department have' pointed out the political and social difficulties involved in providing direct assistance to primary and secondary education in the Middle East. It is suggested, however, that assistance might be given to the Middle East Governments on the same, lines as that provided by the A.I.O.C. - i.e. by building and equipping schools for them. (See paragraph 4 above)... • • ...o • ' 30. The Final Report of the United Nations Survey Mission emphasises the importance of technical training at the foreman level. (See paragraph 21 above). Such training is considered by the State Department and ourselves to be one of the outstanding needs in .the Middle East. The., provision or expansion of technical training facilities is essential if the nationals of the Middle East countries are to be fitted to the tasks which development demands. . But, with the possible exception of Egypt,, no, Middle ^ast country at present possesses sufficient qualified staff or the means of training that staff to carry out large schemes of • development. : , 31 The principal fields in which technic alt training is required are; Land use, including agriculture, forestry, soil conservation and animal husbandry; industry and mechanised agriculture; public health-training of doctors, nurses, midwives and sanitary inspectors; and training o , teachers. 55 •4 *'*' 32, External assietanoc in the prj&gt;visi-&gt;n of technical training in the MiJJle Haet can be given in the fallowing f o me: (i) General advice on the layout of training schemes, syllabus of training etc., (ii) Recruitment of foreign staff for teaching in the principal technical schools and colleges; (iii) the establishment of new technical training schools and faculties; (iv) The endowment of existing or new institutions. (v) The scientific and technical equipment for those institutions, (See also paragraph 29) (vi) 'The promotion of u training within industry” schemes by the provision of skilled instructors, (The ii.,1,0.0, already has such a scheme.) (vii) The recruitment of foreign specialists to undertake research and to train local students who would ultimately replace them, . (This is dealt with in paragraphs 15 and 18 ab ;ve) , (viii) The provision of technical training facilities for Riddle dast students in foreign countries. (See paragraph 34 below), clear that as part of 33• The terms of the Fourth Point Bill make it the provision of technical training is envisaged the programme. The United Nations expended programme also envisages the provision of technical training in the field, and may (though this is not yet clear) cover s mie advanced technical training abroad (see below). The value from the educational point of view of the Piljt Demonstration projects recommended by the dconomic Survey Mission will be great# 34. ^e consider that an importaxxt aspect of ^duc»a1 1 ^n a.n^. technical training policy is the provision of agricultural extension services, Much services are at present virtually non-existent in most Middle bast countries* They are, however^ essential corollary to the carrying out of research projects ana the application of modern techniques to agricultural development&lt; It is suggested that provision should be made both in bilateral and in United Nations programmes for the promotion of these services. (c) Provision of training and educational facilities for ivii Or!i n Gn.Qt pindent p an^ experts in foreign count ri os. ; n 35, The expansion of existing arrangements for the training of Middle Mast experts abroad is an important aspect of economic and social development policy. It would presumably be possible.for the United States to absorb more Middle Mast students',: In this country, however, the Universities and other places of higher education are very overcrowded ana it is ^oubtful if they could absorb any appreciable further numbers of Middle East students, ^t present the limiting fact or is not lack of finance, but lack of places. The Fourth Point Bill makes t no specific reference to the provision of facilities * for education and technical training in the United Statue, but the State Department have stated that provision for training foreign experts either abroad or in the United bt;.tes is intended. There is already in existence a United Nations programme financed under the ordinary budget for the provision df /fellowshipsfellowships abroad in subjects related to economic development open to candidates from all members of the United Nations* programme started in 1949 with a provision of 68 fellowships, .. -The General assembly has- at the Fourth session approved a greatly increased provision for this pur- ..pose of approximately #400*000 in 1950. Fellowships are also available under the United Nations .advisory Social welfare Services to enable the nominees of any government (not merely of members of United Nations) to study such subjects as Family and Child Welfare,; Social welfare administration. Housing and Town and Country Planning and the Provontion of Crime and Treatment of Offenders, W.H.O,, F.^,0• and U,N,S.S,C#0# have for some time been operating fellowships programmes available to nominees, of. their members governments, for the stuoy of subjects falling within their, re-spec-tive- fields, and I.L,0, is also shortly to initiate a fellowship programme. VII. Capacity of Middle Bast t o absorb Technical assistanc e. 36. Th^ British Deputy Head of the United Nations Survey Mission has roughly estimated that the four pilot projects recommended by the Mission will require the services of some 30 exports. There are also at present vacancies for sjme 150 experts and technicians under- the Middle East Governments (see paragraph 29 above). The extent of the requirements for technical training ^escribed at (b) above to meet with present an.; future needs cannot be estimated at this stage in terms of figures; but it is considered to be great.. With the anticipated acceleration of development plans as a result of the end of the Palestine war, the refugee problem, the inauguration of the Seven Year plan in Persia, the Nile Waters Project, and the political settlement of the ex-Italian colonies, it seems likely therefore that the full amount of assistance which may be forthcoming under the technical assistance programmes described at-II and III above can bo absorbed in the Middle East# VIII, . Co -ordination of British, America n ano Unit^a Nations Technical assistance to the Midale Hast, 37, The effective operation of the technical assistance programmes to the Middle East will depend largely on the existence of close co-ordination arrangements between the British, American and United Nations t efforts. These arrangements should involve exchange of information about requests received for technical assistance and consultation about how these requests can.best be met, euch consultation would ensure that duplication ana competition were avoided and would enable arrangements to be made for the exchange of personnel between the British Middle East Office and the^permanent team of -American experts if this is set up. In the case of tho United Nations, it is eloar that consultation•cannot be as close as is possible between Hie Majesty* s Gjvernment and the United States Government but it should bo possible to avoid overlappii)g by consultation within the Near-East Relief and WorksAgGncy, regarding the countries which the Agency covers, and by keeping the British and American delegations in New York closely informed.38... Coordination might bo offoctod at one or ali of the following points: (a) London: Foreign Office: United States Smbasgy: ^ (b) ^'ashington: State Department: H*M, Embassy: •.(c) Now York: British and United States Delegations to the United Nations; United Nations Technical assistance Board, whose location has however not yet been, definitely.determined (d) C,.iro: British Middle Bast Office: United States Embassy to Egypt; F.A.O. , and U.N.E.S.C.O., regional offices. (e) Beirut : or wherever the new Relief and Y/orks : . • agency for Palestine Refugees is established: British American and French members of the advisory Commission: Director (who is required to appoint a representative to attend meetings of the United. Nations Technical assistance' Board as an observer). although the New agency’s activities are likely'at tresent to be confined to Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and ^rab Palestine, the United Nations Survey Mission, in ^eir final report, envisage the possibility of its scope being ^ ^1od to Egypt, Iraq and Israel, should'these countries seek I’Gt ..csistanco. 39, . It is suggested that arrangements for co-ordination might be as follows: * v ^ ) Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and iirab Palestine , The Governments concerned might be encouraged, to channel requests for British and American • • technical assistance through the Agency or alternatively British and American Representatives might refer requests received to the Agency. The Governments might also be encouraged to consult the Agency before submitting requests to the United Nations and the Specialised agencies. • (2) Other Middle East Countries. Requests for assistance from Middle Bast Governments might bo sent to His Majesty’s ‘ Government, United States Government, through the British and American Missions, who will it is hoped, collaborate closely' on this subject. Requests for assistance, from the United Nations ana the Specialised Agencies will presumably be 'addressed direct to these organisations or through their Middle East Offices, •• • • . . It is suggested that very close contact should be maintained between His Majesty’s Embassy at Washington and the State Department in order to ensure the co ordination of overall policypnd that liaison between the British, nmerican and United Nations authorities concerned should also bo established in London, New York and Cairo. It is not, however, considered that it will be /necessarym m •% noccseary f^r ue to appoint any aaJitional staff for those purposes* I3p CONCLUSIONS ^Ni) RioCQMMQ jND iiT10NS * 40. ( J \) Of the three broad fields of activity into which the expanded Technical assistance Programmes for the Middle East might be directed - (a) research and technical survey by foreign experts; (b) education and technical training, including extension services, ana (c) provision of training and education facilities in foreign countries - discussed in Section VI above, it is considered that (a) and (b) are of outstanding and equal importance and that a somewhat lower priority should be attached to (c). Yi/e should, therefore, suggest to the U*S, Government and to the United Nations that the funds available should be used as far as possible to meet the neoas described at (a) and (b). In particular, we should seek tj ensure: (i) that the expanded programmes of technical assistance are used to fill the gaps in meeting needs for which no adequate provision at present exists rather than to supply assistance in ferine in which it is at present readily available through normal channels, e.g* the undertaking • of technical surveys by firms of British and or American consultants. (ii) that provision of technical advice on economic development is balanced by the provision of advice on social policy (see M.0.(0) (49) 34). (iii) that provision is made in the technical assistance programmes for the adequate supply of technical and scientific equipment. (2) Wo should take all possible steps to promote' close co-ordination between the United States, the United Nations and our own technical assistance programmes for the Middle East on the lines suggested in Section VIII above#(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S 9207 GOVERNMENT) CONFIDENTIAL IJ.3C.(Q)(50) 2nd Meeting COPY NO.

(Q) (50) 1st Meeting;, Minute 1 ) The Committee considered a, note by the Joint Secretaries (M.E*(0)(50)6) covering a report by the Working Party on technical assistance to the Middle East; they also had before them a note by the Joint Secretaries (M*E.(0)(50)9) covering a letter from His Majesty’s Embassy at Washington together with a -working paper prepared by the State Department on the nature and scope of the United States Fourth point programme, which had been received subsequent to the preparation of M.E.(0)(50)6 and was-supixlementary to it. MR. EVANS said that in their conclusions (summarised in paragraph 40 of M.E.(0)(50) 6 ) the Working Party attached equal importance under the expanded technical assistance programmes to (i) research and survey work and (ii) education and technical training, and stressed under both headings the need for the provision of technical and scientific- equipment. On the question of co-ordination with the United States and the United Nations, the Working Party felt that the new Relief and Works Agency could play an important role, at least, as far as Syria, the Lebanon, Jordan and Arab Palestine were concerned. For the remainder of the area there would have to be co-ordination by the British and United States Missions on the spot, and over and above this, close liaison in Washington, New York (United Nations), London and Cairo (British Middle East Office). As regards M.E*(0)(50)9? the State Department paper contained many interesting sidelights on the United States proposals. The sum allotted for the Near East (including Egypt and the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan) for the whole programme of technical assistance (i.e., by the United States direct and through the United Nations) was stated as $5*2 millions (page 2), as compared with the $Q or 09 million given tentatively in M.E.(0)(50)6, The total of $5.2 million was to be split as to 03 million for experts, $1.3 million for trainees and $0.9 million for technical and scientific equipment. It was envisaged that the training of foreigners (e.g. Arabs) in the United States and in other countries would also be provided for. It would be necessary to revise M.E.(0)(50)6 in the light of the further information provided in M.E.(o)(50)9? and of any comments that Departments might wish to make now or to send later to the Chairman of the Working Party. f In the course of discussion the following points arose:- (a.) The question was asked whether Conclusion (ii) in paragraph x 40 suggested that equal stress was to be laid on both social and economic development in the Middle East. Though we were clearly interested (and would try to persuade the United States authorities to show a similar interest) in the improve ment of social conditions, there was possibly less scope for external technical assistance in this field; much depended on the attitude of the Ministers of the country concerned, and they were perhaps best influenced through normal diplomatic pressure. On the other hand, there was a great need for social workers, and others who could organise extension services (e.g. in agricultural techniques) and put the peasant in the right frame of mind to accept technological improvements. The State Department paper did not bring out the possibilities of such services and it was agreed that the point should be amplified in M.E.(0)(50)6.-2- (b) The general viev/ of the previous meeting had been that the central point of contact and planning for Middle East economic development should be in Washington. The Working party 1 s proposal that the new Relief and Works Agency should play an important co-ordinating role alongside contacts in Washington, London, etc., had the disadvantage that the Agency wguld cover only a limited area, within the Middle East region and might not be in a position to fulfil the important function of day-to-day administration and co-ordination. There was general agreement that the overall policy co-ordination would be best handled in Washington between the Institute for Near Eastern Affairs and His Majesty’s Embassy in Washington. The Committee Subject to amendments along the lines of sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) above, endorsed M.2.(0)(50 )6 as the basis for further talks with the State Department on technical assistance to the Middle East. 2 . POSSIBLE REQUIREMENTS FOR STERLING ASSISTANC OF MIDDLE EAST GOVERNMENTS E FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ( previous reference: m.E.(0)(50) 1st Meeting, Minute I , Csnclusion (3) ) The Committee considered notes by the Joint Secretaries covering reports on the free sterling available to Middle East countries (M.E.(0)(50)7) and on the estimated amounts of possible requests from these countries for sterling assistance in 1950 and 1951 (k.E.(0)(50)8) , which hod been prepared in accordance with the Committee f s instructions at their previous meeting. MR. EVANS said that the main conclusion to be derived from M.E.(0)(50)7 was that Egypt and Persia were the only Middle East countries with substantial amounts of free sterling at their disposal. There were many uncertainties attached to the assumptions in M.E.(0)(50)8, e.g. , that the full contribution of $54 million would be subscribed, that Iraq w r ould obtain the $8-§- million International Bank loan, could balance her budget and could finance her trade over the coming two years. On the other hand, the report assumed that no more than a limited number of projects would be begun within that period. It was not clear whether, if the United Kingdom was unable to meet the sterling element of these requests, the International Bank would be able to cover such sterling requirements. There was general agreement that the estimates of sterling requirements for projects in the Middle East in 1950 and 1951&gt; though necessarily tentative, could be accepted as a provisional basis for discussion. It was pointed out that the complementary dollar requirements we re stated for the projects in question in the Committee’s interim report (M.E.(0)(49)27). The Committee then proceeded to consider in v/hot way it mi lit be possible to meet colls for assistance of this order either from the United Kingdom’s own resources or through the International Bank, particularly as the amounts os estimated did not appear to be unduly large, at least for the immediate period under considera tion. In the course of discussion the following points arose:- (a) The Treasury were still of opinion that due regard must be had to the overall balance of payments position and to the possible demand from other areas under consideration, e.g. Couth East Asia. Any particular requests of a reasonable nature could, of course, be considered ad hoc by the Treasury, as and when they were put forward.(b) As far as the provision of loans by the International Bank was concerned, there were a number of difficulties, of which the most important was that neither Jordan nor the Sudan were members of the Bank, and thus in present circumstances were not eligible for loans’ from it. It was hoped that when Jordan established an independent currency, they might be able to join the International Monetary Fund and the Bank, but in the^case of the Sudan there appeared to be both practical and political- difficulties, When the question of the Sudan loan had been raised tentatively v^ith the Treasury by the Sudan Government, they had been advised to put their case in the first place to the Foreign Office, (c) The use of the United Kingdom 18 &gt;o contribution for loans to the Middle East Governments would involve unrequited exports, in the same way as 'would the raising of a loan on the London market. There was, of course, a case for arguing that investment in the Middle East in the form of capital goods 'would in the long term be of value to the United Kingdom in retaining the market for future orders, and in ensuring that we had a chance of balancing payments with the Middle East in fifteen or more years’ time. On the other hand, we could not overlook our present supply position, nor, of course, the essential question of the customer’s solvency in any particular case, (d) Any loan raised by the International Bank would entail the raising of local currency funds either by internal loans or taxation in the country concerned. The internal financial position of the Middle East countries differed considerably. The Bank could not raise a loan in any country for use in that country. The Committee then considered what advantage might be taken of Sir Ernest Rowe-putton’s return to Washington to put the United Kingdom views before the International Bank in respect of possible loans to the Middle East, It was pointed out that in the previous discussions with the Bank recorded in M,3.(0)(49)36 it was envisaged that the dollar element to be provided would be on a comparatively small scale because of the difficulty which recipients would have in servicing loans in dollars. The Treasury had, however, suggested that they might prefer dollar loans to cover expenditure in 'the sterling area even with the inherent difficulty of repayment, rather than sterling loans with the inevitable consequences on our balance of payments position. The question was raised whether the task of economic development in the Middle East should be looked on as primarily a matter for purely Anglo-American co-operation, and if we were over-zealous in encouraging the International Bank to take an interest in this matter we might be asked to state more clearly what sterling contribution we ourselves were prepared to undertake. On the other hand, both from the political and defence point of view the Middle East w: s an area of crucial importance; the size of the problem had been shown to be more manageable than might prove to be the case with other areas, and United States interest in it had already been stimulated. It was therefore agreed that the line to be adopted by Sir Ernest Rowe-Duttonshould be to suggest to the Bank the advantage of diversifying their interests and in this connection of giving due consideration to the Middle East; and that he should seek particularly to secure the interest and support of the United States Treasury representative on the International Bank, The Committee:- (1) Subject to the points raised in discussion y approved li.E•( 0 )( 50)7 and 8, (2) Invited Sir Ernest Rowe-Dutton on his return to Washington to seek to stimulate interest in the Middle East on the part of the International Bank and in particular on the part of the United States Treasury representative on the Bank.

WASHINGTON, D.C. 11th January 1950 Dear Trevor, Thank you for your letter of the 5th January about the 4th Point Programme. I gave Norman Burns a short memorandum based upon it and it provided a very good opportunity to discuss with him the latest developments of the Point 4 Programme in particular relation to the Middle East. 2. He handed me the attached State Department working paper on the nature and scope of the Programme. I think you will find it valuable in clearing up certain points. During our discussion the following additional points came out which amplify the working paper; (a) On Page 3 you will find what is described as the ’’tentative. United States - United Nations Technical Assistance Programme for the Fiscal Year beginning 1st July 1950”. You will observe that this is a United States-- United Nations Programme and not purely and simply an American programme,, The total sum of #5* 2 million allotted to the Near East therefore contains an unknown amount from United Nations sources, (apparently to be decided at the Technical Assistance Conference in April (page 2).) This incidentally seems to be a very important conference and we shall presumably have our ideas about United Kingdom - United States coordination clear by that date. There will also have to be some arrangement for coordination with the United Nations experts. He added also that as the European Co-operation Administration have taken over a certain amount of Point 4 work in Africa the figures for that continent would be reduced and the money so made available spread over other parts of the world. You will observe that the expenditure of /&gt; 5*2 million is divided between experts, trainees and materials. Exactly what functions the State Department intends £hall be covered under Point 4 may be seen from the last paragraph on Page 5 and the top of Page 60 You will see that most of the points that you raised in your letter of the 5th January are in fact covered. /(b) Trevor Evans Esq., O.B.E., Middle East Secretariat, Foreign Office, London, S.W.l.(Id) Burns said that the State Department is hopeful that Point 4 legislation will in fact he passed in this session of Congress which comes to an end in June* It is just possible that there will he some hitch hut it seems highly unlikely. (c) The State Department has as yet come to no agreement within Itself as to how the Point 4 Programme will he managed. At the moment the proposal is that there will he a 'general manager” situated in the Economic Department of the State Department who will he assisted hy an interdepartmental Committee including the Department of Agriculture etc. etc. In each of the territorial bureaux there will he officers concerned primarily with Point 4. The relationship of these officers to the General Manager has not yet been decided. As far as the Near Eastern Bureau is concerned Arthur Gardiner is the chief man assisted hy Norman Burns for the Arab World and hy two others for Greece, Turkey, etc.'' r and the Par East. Each Embassy and Legation will also have its Point 4 Specialist. (d) According to Burns no detailed Point 4 Programmes have been worked out for the Middle East. The Department does, however, expect to start informal conversations within six weeks with representatives of countries likely to enter into Point 4 agreements hut this was an extremely delicate matter to undertake before funds had in fact been appropriated. Yours sincerely, (Signed) Denis GreenhillRESTRICTED Working Paper Near East Conference East-West African Conference December 20, 1949 NATURE AND SCOPE OF THE POINT FOUR PROGRAM 1 . What is the Point IV Program ? President Truman*s message to Congress, June 24#1949* defineA the purpose and scope of. the Point IV Program in these terms* Its purpose was 'to enable the United States, in cooperation with other countries, to assist the peoples of economically underdeveloped areas to raise their standards of living'• In scope, it was 'an expanded program of technical assistance for such areas, and an experimental program for encouraging the outflow of private investment beneficial to their economic development' — that is, technical assistance and economic development. Congress began consideration of Point IV with the i - ‘ ■&gt; introduction of two basic bills in July 1949 but action has not been completed on either. Congress will probably resume consideration of these bills early in the forthcoming January session, and it is hoped that enabling legislation and appropriations will be enacted so the operating program may begin by July 1* 1950. One bill is the 'International Technical Cooperation Act of 1949'(H.R. 5615 of July 12, 1949) that would authorize the United States to participate in a cooperative technical assistance program. The House Foreign affairs Committee held hearings on this bill but has not yet voted on it. Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearings have not begun. To Implement the bill, the President*s message recommended an appropriation of # 45 * 000,000 for the first year of the program. The Senate and House appropriation Committees will not hold hearings on the appropriation until the basic legislation is passed. The second bill is 'to vest in the Export-Import Bank of Washington the power ••• to guarantee United States private capital invested in productive enterprises abroad which contribute to economic development in foreign countries against risks peculiar to such investments' (H.R. 5594 of July 12, 1949 and the identical S. 2197 of July 6 , 1949). The Senate and House Banking Committees have reported favorably on these bills as amended, but the Senate and House have not yet acted. 2. Point IV Relates Primarily to Relatively less Developed Areas There is no general definition of 'under-developed' which excludes any country, even the United States* All countries are under-developed in the sense that with the present state of our knowledge and technology, any country could make better use of its resources. On the basis of per capita income, most of Latin America, Africa and Asia are considered under-developed. The technical cooperation program, however, is not confined to 'under-developed' areas. It may be extended to countries which, while technically more advanced, can benefit from using improved techniques. Dependent areas are eligible for technical cooperation under Point IV and are subject to thesame criteria as other areas. 3• Cost of Technical assistance under Point IV The world—wide cost of Technical Assistance for the fiscal year heginnxng July 1 , 1950, is expected to he in the order of magnitude of /86 million. It is contemplated that the United states and the U.N. cooperating countries will hear approximately wo “^. :ir 2 s total cost — i.e., #57 million — and- the recipient countries one-third,i.e. #29 million. , + , Th ? size of the UN portion of the program, the contributions ,^ ldUa i L P ar&gt;tioi Pating countries, and the exact projects which the UN might conduct, have not been determined. Decisions ma tters may be reached during the International Technical Assistance Conference called by ECOSOC for April 1950.

' . . . As yet EGA has spent very' little of these funds. However, on May 4, 1949, the EC^ requested the OSEC (the Organization for European Economic Cooperation, representing the EGA recipient countries) to submit information on major developmental projects under way or being planned in their dependent overseas territories. EGA is now receiving such projects, which.it will examine In the next few months with the intention of uning some of its funds to accelerate progress on the most urgent projects. The exact projects that EGA may approve is not;yet known but it may be assumed that criteria for making the choice will be the possible dollar saving or dollar earning' nature of the project, the possibility of completing the project before EGA ends, the extent to which the project relates to ECA f s major activities and fits in with EGA's ability to conduct the project* For example, long range education and public health assistance might be more appropriate to Point IV than to EGA operations whereas the exploration of a strategic mineral reserve: might logically be .an EGA operation. • . ' The Economic Survey Mission has recommended a #54 million program (one-half to be financed by the U.S.) for the next year, as soon as funds can' be obtained, for work relief in the Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and Gaza. The UN General Assembly has recommended the setting up of a UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees ( in the Near East to conduct the operation. Its projects will relate to' agricultural development, community service, engineering developments and financial controls. Such projects have not been included in the Point IV program outlined above for the. countries concerned.^Qw_the Tech olcal Assistance Program will be carried out The actual mechanics of putting.-4&gt;he technical assistance program into operation cannot he set forth until Congress has decided upon the enabling legislation under which we will operate and until the UN has decided upon its own procedures. According to current plans, the U*S, or the UN would render technical assistance only when requested by a prospective recipient country. Such assistance would be granted only if the U,S, or the UN regarded the project as well conceived. Technical assistance, to be effective, should be related to economic development plans. Por this reason, prospective recipient countries should be formulating their economic development programs as soon as possible in order that they may submit realistic requests for technical assistance as soon as U,S. and UN facilities become available. If a country lacks a well-coordinated development program, it may request U,S. ,or UN technical assistance to formulate such ~ a program, as was done by the U.S, Mission to Brazil and the UN Mission to Haiti.. One requisite of a well—coordinated program is that it tak^.account of the capacity- of the local country either to finance the direct and ancillary costs, both in the initial stage and in long run maintenance, or to obtain outside finance if local finances are inadequate. A second requisite is that account be taken of the need for ancillary projects to accompany primary projects. Por example, the development of new mine might require the training of technicians to operate the mine, the building of roads to move the output, the adoption of special health measures if the mine is in a disease-ridden area, the construction of docks to place the ore on ships, and even a study of foreign markets if the product is already in world over—supply. Requests for technical assistance should be guided by the fact that inadequate attention to complementary auxiliary projects has wfeckeo many otherwise good economic development programs. The U.S., if requested and if it regarded the request as acceptable, would then enter into a bilateral agreement with the recipient country stipulating the contributions and obligations of each. The U.S. would render technical assistance for specified projects or purposes. The recipient^ contributions would vary, according to its financial resources and the nature of the project but, as a general rule, recipient countries might be expected to bear one-third of the total cost. The recipients contribution would be in kind or in local currency to meet local costs such as office space, pay of indigenous personnel, travel within the country, etc. The bilateral agreements, in the view of the Department, might cover some or - all of the following reports: (1) Undertaking to pay a fair share of the costs of the program, which share should normally include as much as possible of the local currency costs, and, possibly a negotiated additional amount all or part of which could be paid in local currency; ( 2 ) Undertaking to cooperate in the execution of the program and to assist visiting experts, so far as possible; \ . (3) Undertaking to follow through with the recommendations which arise out of the program so far as practicable, and to report periodically on such action as is taken to carry out these recommendations;(4) Undertaking, where appropriate, to employ arrangements based on the ’'servlcie technique” — involving the establishment of a government bureau, possibly under the initial direction of a foreign expert, to carry out the program, '■ and joint participation of U,S. and local experts; ( 5 ) Undertaking to give full publicity to the program within the country to permit observation by Impartial observers, representing the U.S. or the international organization or organizations concerned, as the case may be. (6) Undertaking to inform and to consult with the U.S, or the organization rendering the assistance, before seeking other technical assistance which might duplicate assistance already being received; (7) Undertaking, where appropriate, to cooperate with other participating countries in reciprocal exchange of technical assistance or information. By ’'technical assistance” the U.S. means the rendering of technical advice or leadership by sending U.S. technical experts abroad, by training foreign experts either abroad or in the’U.S., or by providing technical publications, technical data and demonstration equipment. It would ificlude the salary and travel expenses of technicians, materials or equipment for demonstration or pilot' plants and educational equipment but not capital equipment for actual economic development. For example, it'‘would include a flood control' expert to advise a local government in beginning or completing a conservation dam, but would not include cement, bulldozers or labor to construct the dam. The State. Department report to Congress entitled 'Cooperative Program for Aid in the Development of Economically Under-developed Areas” (July 1949&gt; P*3)&gt; which was distributed to all U.S. posts in October 1949indicates the following types of technical assistance that the U.S. might give under Point IV: ”........basis studies and surveysof economic problems, needs and potential lines of development; furnishing expert advisers or missions to advise governments, private organizations, or business enterprises in development projects; helping to establish and operate research and experimental centers and laboratories;, developing demonstration projects; providing on-the-job training; furnishing and instructing in the use of sample materials and equipment; consulting and advising with foreign visiters; translating and publishing specialized reports; assisting technical schools and universities; exchanging students and teachers in technical fields; bringing workers, supervisors, engineers and executives to the more advanced countries to observe or train in their industrial and other establishments; organizing international conferenceson .economic problems and providing technical data, publications and samples of materials for research and experimental purposes; and establishing and operating technical libraries and film services. M The various fields in which the U.S. might render - technical assistance are indicated in Appendix I of this report. It is assumed that the aid will be handled through the State Department in cooperation with other government departments that deal with specialized subjects. It is not possible, at this juncture, to indicate any general rule as to whether a project should be undertaken through U.S. bilateral channels or through UN multilateral channels. It is expected that UN including its specialised agencies such as the World Health Organization, the International Labor Office, the Food and Agriculture Organization, etc., will be used as much as practicable. The multilateral procedure may prove most useful for projects requiring coordination among several countries. Among those might be: the control of epidemic diseases or pests tha’t spread across frontiers; the mobilization of resources of a number of countries, such as fisheries; the formulation of air navigation standards; international transportation surveys, etc. The UN may prove especially useful in general assistance such as health or education, where it is desirable to avoid a one-country bias. On the other hand, bilateral assistance may prove most useful where specific central responsibility is technically necessary, e.g., the planning’of a flood Control program leading to. the construction of a wide network of consorv .ticn dams. In various are .s there may do political reasons for favoring or not f-.vorin^ - U *N* aid as castingulshod from bilateral aid* ThC'-UN'role in ^ter 1 thp Qnn aQ &gt; wi ^ bcj fomu:iat0( - ^ greater detail after the ECOSOC Conference on technical assistance in April. 5* Technical Assistance does not of itself include Development Loans or Grants. Some countries have the impression that technical assistance means the U.S. or UN will automatically make available large direct loans or grants for economic development. This is not correct. Technical assistance may lead to the formulation, of good projects (e.g., geological surveys to explore mineral resources, flood control surveys indicating where dams•would•prevent floods and create hydroelectric power; disease control projects that eliminate obstacles to economic development etc.) but capital funds to accomplish the actual economic development must be obtained from the sources other than the 'Technical Assistance' budget. Capital for long run economic development projects may be obtained from various sources. An under-developed country should look first to 'self-help' financing, either through local taxation for long run governmental developmental programs such as irrigation and flood control, or through tapping private local capital for smaller projects such as factories to process local raw materials or to supply local needs. Sometimes local private capital would be forthcoming if local laws gave greater security to the private investor, if tax laws were modernized and if company laws gave greater inducementsto corporations and cooperatives. Secondly, a recipient government should look to private capital from abroad, either the U.S. or other foreign countries. Here again, local legal restraints, in the form of arbitrary company laws, arbitrary regulations regarding the 'enyployment of local management and labor, lack of security under the local legislation against expropriation, legal impediments against the reasonable repatriation of earnings or capital, double taxation, etc., tend to discourage foreign investment. The long run success of the Point IV Program depends, in considerable measure, upon stimulating the flow of private capital from the capital supplying countries to the under-developed countries. Our Friendship, Commerce and Navigation Treaties are one means of creating a favorable climate for such private investment. Thirdly, under-developed countries may look to the International Bank for developmental loans. The International Bank, in its latest Annual Report, ^ indicated a desire to aid under-developed countries in analyzing their development problems and potentialities, In rendering technical advice and in supplementing efforts of local governments with financial help. In passing upon applications for financial help the Bank applies these criteria: whether the loan can be obtained privately on reasonable terms, whether there are reasonable prospects Of repayment, whether it is for a ’’sound and productive purpose” and whether it is of sufficient importance to the economy of the country to warrant incurring a foreign exchange liability to finance it. The Bank emphasized in its latest Report: ’’The principal limitation upon Bank financing in the development field has not been lack of money but lack of well-prepared and well -planned projects ready for immediate execution. The explanation lies in the gap which exists between the concept of development potentialities, on the one hand, and the formulation of practical propositions designed for the realization of these potentialities, on the other.” Fourthly, the under-developed countries may seek loans ^FOm foreign governments or the U.S. Export-Import Bank. The Export-Import Bank, like the International Bank, is reluctant to make loans on economic development projects that are not ”well-ijrepared and well-planned projects”. The Export-Import Guarantee Bill, referred to above, would facilitate the flow of private investment from -the U.S. to under-developed countries and here, also, the emphasis will be on sound projects. k A revised copy of this document will be available in early February. The Department has also issued a French language translation of a report on Point IV by the House Foreign Affairs Committee entitled ”Le Point Quatre, Programme d’Application”./ 9.

Requests will depend on (a) what projects are put into effect in the period and (b) the ability of the local Governments to find sterling from their own resources. No attempt was made in the Interim Report to estimate_these factors - the breakdown given in Annex C of the Interim Report was prepared on the assumption that it would be possible for the whole programme to start in 1950* 2. The Report of the Economic Survey Mission gives some answer to the question in (a) as regards Jordan t Arab Palestine, Syria and the Lebanon . 3. Virtually all the projects listed as typical relief work projects and also the pilot demonstration projects recommended by the Economic Survey Mission appear in some form in the annexes to the M«E.(o) Interim Report. 4« The relief works projects will be financed from the funds available to the now United Nations agency. This is on the assumption that the $ 54 million required for the programme will be subscribed in full. As regards the pilot demonstration projects (Wadi Zorka, Wadi Qilt P the Ghab and tho Litani Survey), construction work in the Wadi Qilt and 2/3rd of the construction work in tho Wadi Zorka will be financed from the Relief Works T Budget. It is reasonable to hope that the Lebanese Government, when approached by the new Agency, will agree to contribute substantially to the financing of tho Litani Survey, and will be able to do so. On the other hand, it is most unlikely that the Syrian Government owing to their present budgetary and balance of payments difficulties, will bo able to finance more than a small part of the equivalent of the $ 16 million required for tho execution of the Ghab project, nor is it likely that the Lebanese Government will bo able to finance the execution of the Litani project after the survey, which will take one year, is completed. 5* The Economic Survey Mission in their Pinal Report recommended the establishment of a fund of not exceeding $10 million for the purpose of assisting the Governments concerned with the survey work and the completion of the pilot demonstration projects. They hove recommended that the Governments should be given an assurance that requests for external financial assistance, if necessary, would receive careful and friendly consideration. The purposes of the fund as regards technical assistance may largely be met from resources under the Fourth Point and from those of B.M.E.O, There is little doubt, however, that funds will have to be made available to assist in the execution of projects, possibly on the following basis.JORDAN. 6 . Uj) to £1 million in 1951 to complete the Wadi Zerka and possihljr to start similar Tjrojects in other Wadis. The United Kingdom will x^ohably t)e called upon to furnish this assistance. SYRIA. 7* It is possible that the French who have shown particular interest in the G-hab project, and who last year considered making funds available for refugee re-settlement in the Euphrates valley, may contribute financially to the implementation of the Ghab project. The International.. Bank , may also be interested but it is possible tlmi the Syrian Government will need to float a sterling loan. Though the amount cannot be accurately estimated at this stage, it may be in the region of £ 500,000 in the course of 1950. LEBANON . 8 . The French and the International Bank may similarly be interested in the execution of the Litani project. But it is likewise possible that the Lebanonese will require to raise a sterling loan, on the London Market. IRAQ . 9. There now appear ter bx? my;-!'^enable prospe^Jiii-^ir-'Vd^w.-jcf the progress made with the Inte r bntiA^rtctl^Bank negotiations for a dollar loan that work on the Wadi Tharthar will begin in the course of 1950 . 10. The International Bank estimate that sterling and Dinars to the amount of £2 million and £2.5 million will be required during the first and second years of full work on the Habbaniya and Tharthar projects. 11. It is estimated that oil royalties during 1950 will amount ot £5*46 million (or £7*5 million if the Haifa pipeline is open during the second half of the year). This income is probably committed to the extent of £.9 million in repayment of the I.P.C. loan, £.12 million interest on the British loan, £2 million capital works budget - total approximately £3 million, thus leaving over £2 million for the sterling and dinar elements in the Habbaniya and Tharthar schemes. 12. It is assumed that the ordinary budget will be balanced, that normal trade will be financed from exports and agreed sterling releases (£ 2.26 million a year) and that 1950 harvest will be normal. If these assumptions are correct, Iraq will not require additional sterling for development purposes. The position in 1951 can reasonably be expected to improve. EGYPT/EGYPT. 13* With the exception of the Owen Falls project, work on the. Nile Waters projects is unlikely to start until 1951 at the earliest. Even if the preliminary negotiations with the Ethiopians rogarding Lake Tana are successfully concluded in the near future, the possibility of the need for further survey work cannot bo excluded. 14. If work is commenced on Nile Waters projects in the course of 1951, it is assumed that the Egyptian Government will be able to finance it in the'initial stages, i,e. during 1951, from their own resources. 15» During 1950, the electrification of the Aswan Dam (which it is now estimated will cost £18 million) will probably be the principal item of capital expenditure, a considerable part of the cost of machinery and of the necessary excavation has already been paid. Part of the balance and also part of the cost of civil engineering works involved may probably be due for payment in 1950 and 1951. It is assumed, however, that the Egyptian Gove nment may be able to meet this expenditure from their own resources, SUDiiN . 16, The 1946 - 1950 Development Programme is not expected to be completed until the middle of 1951 , The further development programme has not yet been elaborated but the Sudan Government anticipate that they will not be able to finance it from their own resources. If progress is made in connexion with the Nile Waters projects, it is clear that the Sudan’s share in the cost of these projects will form an important item in the country’s new development programme. The Sudan’s share in the cost of the Lake Tana project may amount initially to £2 million (a minimum of 10 ^) and ultimately £9 million (a maximum of 50 ^). The Sudanese share of the cost of the Equatorial Nile projects has been estimated at £10 million, spread over a period of up to 20 years. 17. In view of the above it is possible that in 1950 the Sudan Government will seek permission to raise a loon on the London Market. The amount cannot be estimated accurately at this stage, but it may be in the region of £2 million. CONCLUSIONS . 18. Calls on United Kingdom resources for assistance in the sterling financing of development projects during 1950/1 may be estimated as follows Jordan Sudan Lebanon 12^0 £ £ £ 12£L 1.000. 000 2.000. 000 •5 million Syria/i 2 ^o £ ,5 million 1951 £ .5 million 19* It is emphasised that these estimates arc necessarily most tentative. They represent an attempt to forecast what requests for sterling assistance may he forthcoming and do not imply any recommendation regarding His Majesty f s G-overnment ’ s attitude to such requests, if made. jtJp- GOVEHNkENT) CQNyiPEHTIAL Ki.E^'To’) (50) 7 Hith January. 1950.

'li+th January, 1950. / MiTechnical Assistance to the Middle ast The purpose of this paper is: ( 1 ) to describe briefly the technical assistance at present available to the Middle East Governments; ( 2 ) to outline the technical assistance to undeveloped areas which is proposed under the 'Fourth Point' legislation and the United Nations Technical Assistance Programme; (3) To indicate the extent to which such assistance may be available for the Middle East; ( 4 ) to suggest the various fields of activity in which the new programmes might be used to the gre ates t adv an tage; t &gt;.nd ( 5 ) to suggest arrangements for coordinating British, American and United Nations technical assistance to the Middle East, I Tec hni cal A s sista nce_at_ pre se nt a vailabl e to Middle East Gove rnments, (a) Foreign ex perts employed b y Middle East Gover nments„ 1. In the middle of 1949 5 there were estimated to be about 350 British experts and technid'OT (excluding teachers) employed by Middle East Governments (including about 150 of the tcchnici-mgor foreman grade in Egypt and Iraq). In addition, it was estimated that 130 experts of other Western nationalities are employed, the majority in Egypt and Ethiopia. It is estimated that about 20 American Advisers are employed by Middle East Governments. 2. There were at that date vacancies for a further 150 experts (including 50 in the lower grades). These vacancies included 87 for doctors and nurses, 35 fer ongins^j.*-., and 17 for agriculturalists. (b) Firms employed by Midd le _JBasgt ^Governme nts f or consult ation _l^d^su,ryey, 3. A number of British and American firms are mployed by the Middle East Governments as consulteduS or for '• he carrying out of specific surveys. Examples are: the verseas* Consult at. is Incorporated, which is advising the ersian Government on their Seven-Year Plan; Sir Alexander ibb and Partners, who have carried out general economic urveys for the Governments of Styria and the Lebanon; essrs. Goode, Frank, Vaughan, Lee and Gwyther,who act as onsultinp engineers to the Government of Iraq, and bir _ + iurdoch Macdonald and Partners , who are preparing an Irrigation levelopment Survey for the Jordan Government.(c) Assistance in ed u cati on a nd technic ai training p rovided “by f ore ign fir ms in__the/Midd le East . 4. Certain British and American firms s and in particular the oil companies, are carrying out an extensive programme for assistance to the countries in which they operate in the fields of education and technical training* The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company may he cited as an example« The AIOC is building and equiping primary and secondary schools in the Khuzistan Province, which on completion are handed over the the Ministry of Education; it has provided laboratory equipment for the science and engineering faculties at the University at Tehran; it provides a large number of scholarships for Persian students to take university or technical courses in this country, (in 1948, 66 students were thus provided_for); and it provides for a large number of vocational training schemes in Abadan for Persian trainees in different grades. These include short six-months' courses for various semi skilled occupations; five year courses to train boys as low grade artisans; five year courses to train boys as foremen; 3 year courses in science and technology of secondary school standard; and finally, a five year course for technical trainees of University standard, involving the possibili+.v of obtaining a Company University Scholarship in the United Kingdom. 5- (d) The Services of the _De_velopment Divisi on of the British Middle 'Sat Office' wTiich was established in 1946, are available to the Middle'East Governments at their request. The Division includes Advisers in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, entomology, labour, health and statistics, and a co-operative adviser may shortly be appointed, (e) British C ounci l* 6 , The British Council arranges lecture tours to the Middle East countries of British specialists m economic and social, as well as in cultural subjects. Examples are the recent visit of the Chlif Nursing Adviser to the Ministry of Health to lecture in Iraq and Syria/ a recent lecture tour by a senior expert in disinfestation, and a tour which has now been arranged for Sir Malcolm B rling, a senior expert on rural cooperation. The British Counci1^also arranges for visits of Middle East experts and leading scientific and technical authorities to this country to make contact with scientific and research institutions here, and provides a number of scholarships for Middle East graduate and post graduate students to study in British Universities, Kt present there are nearly 40 British Council Scholars bursars from the Middle East, (There are also oyer &gt;00 Egyptian students, and a considerable number of others of Middle Ea nationalities, studying here under their own or their Government’s auspices). The British Council also provides certain Professors for tho American University at Beirut and maintains a students' hostel there. (f) Technical assistance ^iven to the Mid dle East T5y’'T$rTt isE^ Sji^jE^r^d^ter^^rl^s, 7 The Government of Cyprus has recently established a Forestry Training School which is designed to accommodate /Middle East $09 «Middle East, as well as Cypriot, students. The Middle hast Governments are being invited to study at first hand the worn; which is being done in Cyprus in connexion v/ith Malaria control, rural co-operative development and locust control. 3. The British Desert Locust Survey was set up in 1947 with its headquarters at Nairobi to carry out research and control work in the Middle East, in co-operation with the Middle East Governments concerned. 9 . Highly qualified exports are from time to time made available on secondment from the Sudan and Colonial territories to advise Middle East Governments, e.g. the Chief Soil Chemist in the Sudan is now visiting Jordan. (g) Technical assistance from the U .S. Government 10. The United States Government is at present empowered under the Smith Mundt Act (which extends to other areas the facilities available to South American countries; and the Pullbright Act (which enables funds derived from the sale oi surplus military equipment to be devoted to cultural purposes) to provide assistance to Middle luast Governments in cultural and technical matters. It is not known to what extent such assistance has so far been given. (h) Technical assistance from the United Nations Specialised Agencies and the Inter national Bank. 11. The Pood and Agriculture Organisation,^the World Health Organisation, and INESIO have established regional offices in the Middle East. These_offices organise periodic regional meetings of technical experts of the various Mi die East Governments and arrange for ad hoc visits of experts from headquarters to advise the Governments on special subjects. The International Labour Organisation has not yet set up a regional office but a regional ILO Conference was held at Istanbul in 1947&gt; and the advice of ILO experts has been sought by Middle East Governments on subjects such as social security and co-operation. Technical experts from the International Bank have paid visits of investigation to Iraq, rersia, Egypt, Ethiopia and the Lebanon in connexion with the request of these countries for loans. Advisers have been pjrovided by the United Nations on such matters as the training of social welfare workers in Egypt and on customs, taxation and tariff reforms in Persia. 12. The United Notions’ Economic Survey Mission has made its important Interim and Pinal Reports on the Arab refugees and the economic development of the area, with particular reference to Syria, the Lebanon and Jordan and Arab Palestine, and the Near—East Relief and Works Agency is being set up under the General Assembly s resolution of December 8 th to implement the programme of relief and relief works. II Pourth Point Legislation 13. On July 1st. 1949, President Truman submitted to Congress two bills for the implementation of his ’’Fourth Point', one of v/hich were concerned with the provision of /technical...technical assistance to undeveloped areas,, The hill states that 'it is the objective of this Act' to enable 'the Government of the United States to participate in programmes, in cooperation with other interested governments, for the interchange of technical knowledge and skills which contribute to the balanced and integrated development of the economic resources and productive capacities of economically undeveloped areas'. In carrying out this objective, 'the participation of the United Nations', its 'related organisations, and of any other international organisation shall be sougut wherever practicable' a The 'technical co-operation programmes' to be carried out under the Act, 'may include but need not be limited to economic, engineering, medical, educational, and fiscal surveys, demonstration, training and similar projects that serve the purpose of promoting the development of economical resources and productive capacities of under-developed areas 14, It is understood that the United States have in mind a total world expenditure of about ^86 million for the first year of extended technical assistance activities - both through the United Nations and direct U»8„ assistance, ^ They envisage United States and other United Nations countries should produce about ^37 million, and that the countries receiving assistance should put up about ^29 million to meet local expenses. To this end the President has included in the U.S 1930 - 1 budget $43 million for the United States proportion. It is understood that from £10 - 13 millions of these funds may be placed at the disposal of the United Nations and the Specialised Agencies as the United States contribution to their Expanded Programme of Technical Assistance (see below)c A further ?10 million is already committed unde- listing programmes. The balance will t&gt;e administered by the United States Government under bilateral arrangements * 13, The recent conference of Heads of United States Missions in the Middle East recommended that an Institute of Near East affairs should bo set up in Washington, under the auspices of the State Department, to administer and co-ordinate American assistance to the area. United Nations__Te_c_hrii_ca 1 Assistance -jg ipUe General Assembly has now approved the Expanded Programme of Technical Assistance y drawn up by the Economic and Social Council in August. 19t9.

The tirsi year •V^ programme will probably be of the order of ^15 - 20 million. The greater part of the funds will be allocated to the administering agencies according to the following fixed percentages: United Nations 23 % I«L • 0 • F. A. 0. 23 % UNESCO 1U% ICAO W.H.O. 22% 17- We understand that U.S.Government have worked °ut roughly the way in which the total programme of ^86 million might be spent, both between areas receiving assistance, and fields in which the assistance might be given. These estimates provide for 31$ of the total going to the Near East and Africa (£' 26.5 million); for 21$ of the total to be spent on agriculture and forestry, 25 $ on health, 10 $ on education, aad9$°n industry. IV Amount of Assistance of U.S. u point Four' a nd United Nations Technical Assistance programmes likely to~ be available to the Middle East . 18. The State Department estimated that the sum available for Arab countries under Fourth Point bilateral assistance might amount to £5 million during the first year. They pointed out that conditions would almost inevitably bo attached which would necessitate its being spent on salaries of American experts, perhaps with latitude for a small proportion to be spent on salaries of experts who were nationals of the countries benefitting and for the provision of technical equipment. The State Department estimated that this might be sufficient to pay for the salaries of about 200 experts. 19* If, for the purposes of a very rough estimate, it is assumed that the United Nations assistance is allocated to the Middle East on the same basis as that suggested by the State Department for the bilateral assistance, a further £ 3-4 million might be available to those Middle East countries who are members of the United Nations or the Specialised Agencies. The experts provided under this programme could, of course, be drawn from any country contributing to the programme.V Limitinr Factors 20, The following are the limiting factors which are likely to apply to these two programmes: (a) The recent Istanbul Conference of U,S. Heads of Missions in the Middle East recommended that Point Four assistance should in no case he furnished to Middle Fast Governments exeexot at their specific request, and until evidence had been produced that it would be effectively utilised. In the United Nations 1 technical assistance programme, similar conditions are specifically laid down. (b) The State Department have pointed out that there may be considerable difficulty in recruiting, in the U.S.A., the full numbers of experts required to meet the bilateral Fourth Point programme. As regards the U.N. programme, there is likely to be a similar difficulty in finding experts from the United Kingdom or Commonwealth.VI* Suggested Fields of activity for the Expanded Technical Assistance Programmes in the Middle East* (a) Research and Technical Survey hy Fore ign Experts in the Middle East. 21. The United Nations Economic Survey Mission, in Appendix III to their Pinal Report, have summarised the ’’research and technical survey requirements in the Middle East countries' an(?, after pointing out the vital importance of hasing development on sound surveys have stated that: 'Unfortunately the Middle East countries (except Israel) have a serious lack of the type of trained specialists competent to conduct such surveys, not only on the higher hut on the technical foreman level...... It is clear that, although more use can he made of local ability, most of the technicians to survey, plan and design the development schemes essential for the Middle East, will have to come from ahroad'... The fields in which such technical assistance is required can for convenience he divided into six major heads: (1) Study of the basic elements land and water, and their products, the basic industry of agriculture in its broad sense; (2) Examination of the second primary source - mineral wealth; ✓ (3) Survey of industrial development; (U) Technical advice on transportation; ( 5 ) Study of economic and administrative implications of development; 22. The following list of the subjects in which technical surveys and advice are generally required is then given: Cartography, Soil Chemistry, Erosion Control, Land tenure, Meteorology, Hydraulic engineering, Geology, Irrigation engineering, Hydroelictric engineering, Crop Husbandry, Horticulture, Animal Husbandry, Plant Pathology, Veterinary Science, Entomology, Agricultural Economy, Fisheries, Forestry Industry and industrial processing — e.g. chemistry, sugar refining, textile production, dairy processing, etc. Transport: Ports, Rivers, Railways, Roads, Airfields, Statistics, Administration, Finance, Labour, Health, Education, Police. 23. We suggest that survey and research generally may conveniently be divided into the following categories: (i) Initial exploratory surveys in the fields of both economic and social development to examine in general terms what is required and draw up general plans of action. These have hitherto been carried out by private firms of Consultants (e.g. the Gibb ^ Surveys of Syria and Lebanon, the Overseas Consultants Survey of Persia); by specially appointed Commissions (e.g. the Haigh Irrigation Commission in Iraq, the recent United Nations Survey Mission); and by individuals, including the Advisers to the Development Division of the British Middle East Office. (ii) Detailed surveys of specific capital development proiects. These are normally carried out by. firms of Consultants, examples arc: the surveys of the ^leppo Water Scheme and Latakia port in Syria carried out by Sir ^ * Gibb and Partners; the survey which Sir Murdoch Macdonald and Partners are making of the Jordan Valley project; and Phase II of the O.C.I. operations in Persia. The survey of the Litani River, recommended in the Pinal Report of the United Nations Survey Mission, appears to fall within this category. Preparation of detailed specifications for capital development projects. These normally would be carried out by firms of Consultants. An example is the specifications for the Wadi Tharthar flood control scheme in Iraq, which are now being prepared by the Consulting Engineers to the Iraq Government. Long-term appointments involving the organisation and carrying out of research schemes, including the training of staff; and the planning and supervision of executive action? in e,g, such fields as forestry and fishery development, transport, labour, health etc., The 150 vacancies which at present exist under the Middle Last Governments, referred in Section I above, fall mainly into this category* (v) Brief surveys in highly specialised particular subjects - e.g. water surveys in former Italian Colonies. The experience of the Development Division of the British Middle Last Office has shown the value of establishing on a regional basis a small team of permanent exports - who are men of considerable standing and snniority in their particular fields - to meet the need at (i). This arrangement ensures that experts are available at short notice, provides for the possibility of follow-up visits (which are most important) and also enables the experts to acquire, and make continuous use of, a background of knowledge of and contacts in the countries concerned. 25. The Development Division at present includes 7 senior experts (see paragraph 5 above.) The services of these experts are in increasing demand by the Middle East Governments (and in two coses we have been obliged to second them to the Governments for periods six months to a year,) and the work is becoming more than they can at present deal with. It is hoped, therefore, to expand the Division by the inclusion of, perhaps, half a dozen moru experts. Nevertheless, a team of this size will not bo adequate to meet the anticipated demands of the area as development plans mature. There might therefore be advantage if the U.S. Government attached a similar team of experts to the proposed ’'Institute of Near Eastern affairs.” The members of this team, and of the Development Division of the B.M.E.O., would then, according to the requirements of the Surveys, either visit the countries concerned singly, or grouped together in teams, whose members might be drawn from both offices, and to which ad hoc experts might also be attached. 26, It is understood that the United Nations technical assistance may also be partly provided in the form of teams of experts drawn from the Specialised -agencies. If desirable, /u.n. •U.N « exports miph fc Iso ut’tacbod to the Anglo-American teams referred to clo mainly into this category. 27. The need at (i:L) ea : (iii) ea-n probably best continue to be met fi-uin iu.rms of consultants ? appoini^d by the Governments concernc;d. In some caseSj however the surveys at (ii) might be undertaken by experts from-the British or American teams. 28. 1 The need at (iv) must normally involve the appointment of experts to work with or for the Middle liast Governments concerned for a considerable period - e.g, 3-5 years. It seems to us important to ensure that the Point Four and United Nations Technical assistance programmes are planned to run for at least a period ol 5 (The Fourth Point Bill provides that the president may 'enter into contracts...... that may run for not to exceed 3 years in any one ceso'.) It is also suggested that it would be desirable that the Governments concerned should be invited to make at least a partial contribution to the salaries of these exportSj, in order to ensure that the Governments concerned give due value to their advice. Finally, wo attach groat Importance tc ensuring that these experts ore provided wiith the scientific and technical equipment (e.g„ laboratries) necessary to enable them to carry out their work effectively. (Two oonior experts in Iraq, an anaesthetist and a pathologist, have recently resigned owing to lack of proper equipment for their work) In this connexion, it is suggested that for certain subjects regional laboratries might bo established, o.g ft at Beirut and Cairo, whore the result:. hoc -r 1 . 30. and of the experts’ -—— — &lt;/---- . oq The need at (v) can be met by special vial ^s irom ^ experts, either from the pool or from outside sources. Education and Technical Training The State' Deportment have pointed out the political social difficulties involved in providing direct assistance to primary and secondary education in the Midulo East, It is suggests..j, however, that assistance might bo given to the Middle East Governments on the same lines as that provided by the ^ *1 &gt;0-G „ - i&lt;.o« by building and equipping schools for them, (See paragraph h above). d 31 . The Final Report of the United Nations Survey Mission emphasises the importance ^f technical training^at the foreman level, (See paragraph 21 above). Scuh training is considered by the State Department and ourselves to be one of the outstanding needs in the Middle East._ The provision or expansion of technical training facilities is essential if the nationals of the Middle East countries are to be fitted to the tasks which development demands. Tut, with the possible exception of Egypt, no Middle East country at present possesses sufficient qualified staff or the means of training^that staff to carry out large schemes of development« 32 . The principal fields in which technical training is required are: Land use, including agriculture, forestry, soil conservation and animal husbandry; industry and mechanised agriculture; public health’-training of doctors, nurses, midwives and sanitary inspectors; and training of teachers.33 * liixtornal assistanco in the provision of tochnical training in the Middle East can bo given in the following forms: (i) Genoral advice on the layout of training schemes, syllabus of training etc., (ii) Recruitment of foreign staff for teaching in the principal Technical schools and colleges; (iii) the Establishment of new technical training schools and faculties; (iv) The endowment of existing or new institutions. (v) The provision of scientific and technical equipment for these institutions. (See also paragraph 29) (vi) Thu promotion of 'training within industry' schemes by the provision of skilled instructors. (The i-i.I.O.C. already has such a scheme.) (vii) The recruitment of foreign specialists to undertake research and to train local students who would ultimately replace them. (This is dealt with in paragraphs 15 and 18 above). (viii) The provision of technical training facilities for Middle East students in foreign countries. (See paragraph 34 below). 34. The terms of the Fourth Point Bill make it clear that the provision of technical training is envisaged as part of the programme (see paragraph 1 above). The United Nations expended programme also envisages the provision of technical training, in the field, and may (though this is not yet clear) cover some advanced technical training abroad (see below) (c) Provi sion of training and educational facili ties for Middle East stud en ts and exports in foreign countries^ 35. The expansion of existing arrangements for the training of Middle East experts abroad is an important aspect of economic and social development policy. It would presumably not be difficult for the United States to absorb more Middle East students. In this country, however, the Universities and other places of higher education are very overcrowded and it is doubtful if they could absorb any appreciable further numbers of Middle East students. At present the limiting factor is not lack of finance, but lack of places. The Fourth Point Bill makes no specific reference to the provision of facilities for education and technical training in the United States and it is not clear whether such facilities come within the scope of the programme. There is already in existence a United Nations programme financed under the ordinary budget for the provision of fellowships abroad in subjects related to economic development^ open to candidates from all members of the United Nations. This programme started in 1949 with a j-^avision of ^ 60 5 000 for fellowships. The General Assembly has at the Fourth session approved a greatly increased provision for this purpose of approximately Fellowships are also available under the United Nations advisory Social Welfare Burvices to enable the nominees of any government (not merely of members of United Nations) to study such subjects as Family and Child Aelfare, Social Welfare Administratijn, Housing and Town and Country Planning and the prevention of Crime and Treatment of Offenders, W.H.O., F.A.O and U.N.E.3.C.O. have for ^ some time been operating fellowships programmes available to nominees of their members governments, for the study of subjects falling within^their respective fields, and I.L.O. is also shortly to initiate a fellowship programme.36. The British Deputy Head of the United Nations Survey Mission has roughly estimated that the four pilot projects recommended 'by the Mission will require the services of 30 exx^erts. There arc also at present vacancies for some 150 experts and technicians under the Middle East Governments (see paragraph 23 above). The extent of the requirement for technical training described at (b) above to meet with present and future needs cannot bo estimated at this stage in terms of figures; but it is considered to be great. With tho anticipated acceleration of development plans as a result of the end ^ of the Palestine war, the refugee problem, the inauguration of the Seven Year plan in Persia, the Nile Waters Project, and the political settlement of the ex-Italian colonies, it seems likely therefore that the full amount of assistance which may be forthcoming under tho technical assistance programmes described at II and III above can be absorbed in tho Middle East. VII. Go-ordination of British, ^mo rican and United Nations Tech ni c a 1 s sis tan ce to the M iddle East . 37. The effective operation of the technical assistance programmes to tho Middle East will depend largely on the existence of close co-ordination arrangements between the British, American and United Nations’ efforts. These arrangements should involve exchange of information about requests received for technical assistance and consultation about how these requests can best be met. Such consultation would ensure that duplication and competition were avoided and would enable arrangements to be made for the exchange of personnel between the British Middle East Office and the permanent team of American exports if this is set up. In the cose of the United Nations, it is clear that consultation cannot be os close as is possible betv/een His Majesty’s Government and tho United States Government but it should be possible to avoid overlapping by consultation within the Near-East Relief and Worfts Agency, regarding the countries which the Agency covers, and by keeping the British and American delegations in New York closely informed. 38. Co-ordination might be effected at one or all of the following points: (a) London: Foreign Office: United States Embassy: (b) Washington : State Department: British Embassy: ( G ) New Yor k: British and United States Delegations to the United Nations; United Nations Technical assistance Board. (d) Cairo : British Middle East Office: United States Embassy to Egypt; F.A.O., W.H.O., and U.N.E.S.C.O., regional offices. (e) Beirut: or wherever the new. Relief and Works ilgency for Palestine Refugees is established: British American and French members of the Advisory Commission: Director (who is required to appoint a representative to attend meetings of the United Nations Technical Assistance Board as an observer). although/xxlthough tho Now _ig&lt;jncy f s Qcti'Vitios are likely at present to he confined to Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and i^rah Palestine, the United Nations Survey Mission, in their final report, envisage the possibility of its scope being extended to Egypt, Iraq and Israel, should these countries seek its assistance. 39. It is suggested that arrangements for co-ordination might be as follows: (0 Syria. Lebanon, Jordan and -urab Palestine . Tho Governments concerned might be encouraged to channel requests for British and x.merican technical assistance through the Agency or alternatively British and American Representatives might refer requests received to the Agency, The Governments might also be encouraged to consult the agency before submitting requests to the United Nations and the Specialised Agencies, ( 2 ) Other M iddle_Uast Countries , Requests for assistance from Middle East Governments would be sent to His Majesty^ Government, United States Government, through the British and American Missions, Requests for assistanco from the United Nations and the Specialised Agencies would presumably be addressed direct to these organisations or through their Middle Last Offices. In all cases close liaison could be maintained, through the means described above, in London, Washington, New York,Cairo, and in the countries applying for assistance. It is not, however, considered that it will be necessary for us to pj^oint any additional staff for the purposes of this liaison. VIII CONCLUSIONS RL COMMLNIb .TIQNS . 40. (1) Of the three broad fields of activity into which the expanded Technical Assistance Programmes for the Middle East might be directed - (a) research and technical survey by foreign experts; (b) education and technical training; and (c) provision of training and education facilities in foreign countries - discussed in Section VI above, it is considered that (a) and (b) are of outstanding and equal importance and that a somewhat lower priority should be attached to (c). We should, therefore, suggest to the U.S. Government and to the United Nations that the funds available should be used as far as possible to meet the needs described at (a) and (b). In particular, we should seek to en sur e: (i) that the expanded programmes of technical assistance ore used to fill the gaps in meeting needs for which no adequate provision at present exists rather than to supply assistance in forms in which it is at present readily available through normal channels, e.g. the undertaking of technical surveys by firms of British and or x^morican consultants.(ii) thr.t provision of technical advice on oconomic development is 'balanced 'by the provision of advice on social policy (see M.O.(O) (49) 34)- (ill) that provision is made in the technical assistance programmes for the adequate supply of technicaland scientific equipment. (2) We should take all possible steps to promote close co-ordination between the United States, the United Nations and our own technical assistance programmes for the Middle Hast on the lines suggested in Section VII above, since such co-ordination may prove essential to the successful carrying out of these programmes•^ The Pinal Report does not deal directly with the problem wi* Palestine refugees e Yet the obstacles in the way of economic development in the Middle East are much the same as those hampering the rehabilitation of the Arab refugees. The solution of the problem of the poverty and unemployment of the refugees is inseparable from the solution of the problem of poverty and hunger already effecting a large section of the population of the Middle East. Higher living standards cannot be bestowed by one upon another like a gift. They must grow out of the application of human skill and ingenuity to the physical resource's of the region. There is no short cut to a balanced economy ’or to material prosiDerity. Time can, however, be telescoped by sharing knowledge and provide where invited, friendly technical and financial assistance. SUMMARY INTRODUCTION CHAPTER I. The national economies and standards of living of the Arab lands in Africa differ considerably and none is inseparably linked to the Mi die East. The countries of the Arabian peninsula have a common practice of life more closely related to standards of earlier days than those of other Arab speaking lands. The standards of countries around Palestine differ somewhat one from the other but their economic inter-relation is clear and determined by geography, culture and expirations. Nearly 70% of the inhabitants of these latter countries gain their livelihood directly by agriculture. But the total produce of the land’only offers a bare.maintenance of life to many. The social and economic structure is characterised by a high degree of concentration in the ownership of land, a striking gap between ‘the standard of living for rich and poor and the small size of the middle-class c Basically, the area is, and for a long time to come will remain agricultural. There are some small manufacturing industries; more are needed. Industrialisation on a large scale out of the question. The achievement of a more efficient agriculture and the industrialisation which can be built upon that base cannot be realised immediately. But the first important step is to begin — to break with the habit oi inertia. The land and water resources properly developed can greatly sumo ort increased populations and on a higher standard of living. This applies to the rainfed area of Syria, the plains of Iraq and the Litani Basin in the Lebanon. Jordan and Arab Palestine can, if properly developed help to raise the standard of living for its increasing population. On the other hand, the resources of Israel, oven if exploited could not offer hope of supporting the present standard of living for the existing population, much less a greater one. SUMMARY/SUMMARY CIL.PTRR II - ^ Tho Mission 1 s hopo that sovorol largo development projects could he recommended for immediate expl citation hy large capital outlays has not hoen realised* The r egion is not ready, the projects are not ready, the people and Governments are not ready for large-scale development of the region’s basic river systems or major undeveloped land areas. Many projects have been considered by Middle East Governments. But work has actually begun on but few of these projects. The reason usually given is the lack of available capital. There is truth in this. Wealth is in the hands of relatively few individuals,‘and so long as interest can be obtained on private loans ranging as high as 30 %, tho lower rate of r eturn from public development investments v/ill not be attractive. Taxation yields are also low. Nor is there much prospect of substantial foreign credits on a business basis. Lack of capital is not, however, the only nor is it the most immediate difficulty. The development of water resources frequently involves prior international agreement. In the case of river development projects not requiring prior international agreement, few of them have reached a stage at which construction could begin. Intensive surveys of river basisns viewing the rivers and their hinterlands os units have not been made. for such surveys, it is essential that the responsible Governments should be assisted by the best advice procurable. It is suggested that the b^st approach is th t of the series of 'pilot demonstration projects’.(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S PROPERTY OF HIb GOVERNMENT) CONFIDENTIAL _M.E«(Q) (50)2nd Meeting COPY NO.

SHvIMARY The six countries surveyed by the Mission - i.e., Egypt, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria - are all very young states in terms of autonomous government and administration. Egypt, the oldest of the group, has had no more than tv/enty—seven years of self-government since its re-emergence as a sovereign state in 1922. Iraq achieved its independence upon termination of the British Mandate in 1932. Syria and Lebanon, after having been joined under a French mandate, became distinct sovereign states in 1946, although continuing to maintain a customs union. In that same year of 1946, Jordan also became independent, while Israel did not come into existence until 1948. In vie 1 ,/ of the relatively limited experience of these states in managing their economic and financial affairs, the progress already achieved in certain instances is noteworthy. Nevertheless, in most of the countries surveyed by the Mission, the statistical and other economic data required to make a thorough appraisal of economic and financial conditions are not yet available. Lack of factual information on the national income, budgets, balance of payments, etc., of the Middle East economies has prevented a detailed study of each country's economic position. Severe limitations of time have further closely restricted the survey undertaken by the Mission. But from even this brief study, v/e believe that certain broad con clusions may justifiably be drawn as to the general nature of the Middle East economic problem and* the obstacles to its solution. First, it is only too clear that the Middle East suffers from poverty in the extreme. None of the countries concerned has as yet succeeded in measuring by means of national income studies even the approximate degree ofits impoverishment. The FAO has ventured, on the basis of unstated statistical techniques, the following comparative estimates of income in various Middle ( 1 ) Eastern countries;-^ 1 Estimated Annual Income per Capita : These estimates are undoubtedly subject to a considerable margin of error, which would render it hazardous to attempt any close comparison of one national standard of life with another. But we hardly need wait upon precise studies of national income or even of caloric availabilities for proof of the pervasive incidence of crushing poverty throughout nearly all the Middle East area. One should of course note the exception of Israel where the con tributions of world Jewry precariously support a standard of life far above that attainable from local production. Elsewhere in the Middle East, however, most of the population - perhaps as much as JOfo - lives virtually on the 'argin of subsistence. Conspicuous examples of extravagant spending may of course be found in the cities. But while such maldistribution of income obstructs economic progress in a variety of ways, it is secondary to the basic problem in each country of grossly inadequate output in relation to the total population. This is the central fact of economic life in the Middle East. Prom this fact of poverty, which everywhere springs to the eye, there inevitably follows a familiar chain of economic and institutional problems that have so far defied effective solution. Country U. S. ^ equivalent Afghanistan Egypt Ethiopia Iran Israel Lebanon Saudi Arabia Syria Turkey 50 100 40 85 395 125 40 100 125 2 0) 'Review of Pood and Agricultural Outlook in the Near East' (1949).Under such conditions of intense pressure of hungry populations upon closely limited resources, consumption naturally tends to absorb all available output. As a consequence, the rate of savings inevitably falls far short of the rate of investment required to produce significant improve ments in output and resource utilization. A Lebanese representative in the United Nations Economic and Social Council has cogently described the problem: 'The Middle East provides an excellent example of what is described as a hand-to-mouth economy. Gentlemen, it is literally hand-to-mouth. This being the case, the Middle East can never provide internally the canital with which to develop investment goods as all its energy is spent on the production of consumption goods. Yet again, when such production is considered on a per capita basis it is revealed that the productivity per man hour is much lower tlian in more developed economies The plight of the Middle East is truly a vicious circle. To increase its consumption goods it needs to increase its investment goods, but to increase its investment goods it needs to increase its consumption goods The process will inevitably be lengthy, strenuous and painful.' This basic problem of capital accumulation is rendered all the more scute by the present inability of most of the Middle East Governments to mobilize through public loans even such savings as now materialize. Private savings are attracted by high rates of interest into even more lucrative profit venture-^ or some form of usury, or run to seed in the form of gold hoards. Nor have the several Middle Eastern governments succeeded in devoting any significant share o::‘ their budgetary revenues to basic developmental activities. Expenditure requirements, frequently inflated or misdirected, are currently being financed from an exceedingly narrow tax base which exempts the broad area of non-monctary income, and covers only a relatively minor portion of monetary income. Existing fiscal techniques, which have notsucceeded in tapping the incomes of the wealthy, are grossly inadequate to finance any large-scale programme of economic development. Such paucity of internal financial resources is paralleled hy even more acute shortages of foreign exchange for financing capital imports. At present, the exchange receipts of nearly all of the Middle Eastern economies are devoted almost entirely to financing consumption imports. This is not intended to imply that, in certain countries, considerable amounts of ex change could not, under favourable circumstances, be diverted to capital purposes by cutting down upon luxuries imported for the benefit of a few. But such mobilization of exchange resources for the general economic welfare w r ould encounter no less opposition from powerful private interests than that confronting reform of the tax structure. And in the cases of Lebanon and Syria, governmental efforts to impose controls upon the exchange markets might well result in a drying up of the substantial hard currency earnings which now depend upon unrestricted trading. Egypt and Iraq night, by a further tightening of exchange and trade controls, attempt to divert to capital account a considerable proportion of current sterling receipts, but one encounters here the familiar obstacle of sterling inconvertibility. Finally, the balance of payments of most Middle Eastern countries is acutely vulnerable to the frequently extensive variations in domestic output and to fluctuations in foreign market demand for their closely limited range of exports. These exchange difficulties have in turn discouraged private investment from abroad, even within the relatively narrow range of development ventures premising to amortize themselves through import savings or increased export earnings. Moreover, in all the countries concerned,, the exchange mechanism itself - ranging from the rigidly controlled system operated by Israel to the floating rates permitted by Syria and Lebanon - operates as a major deterrent to any significant influx of private capital from abroad. 4T In general, therefore, the Middle Eastern economies find themselves on dead centre and, in their efforts to move on to a dynamic phase of development, encounter at every turn obstacles created by the very fact of their poverty. Syria affords a striking example of the broad range of these developmental problems. Here one finds in no more than rudimentary form the basic monetary institutions upon 7/hich any developmental programme must rely. Such savings as may be eked out of an oppressively low national income yield only a trickle of deposit funds to the Banque de Syrie and the few other institu tions that now handle the banking requirements of Syria. Par more significant as a medium of savings are private hoards of sovereigns and other gold coins, which further serve as an .accepted standard of value, and often as a means of exchange. The availability of loan funds for productive enterprise is further sharply restricted by the competition of high-profit commercial Broad possibilities undoubtedly exist for economies in current outlay and the ventures, which can apparently afford interest charges of 20% or more. Such shortages of credit facilities bear heavily upon the agricultural community development of greater and more progressive taxation. But progress in this and also check the growth of infant industries. direction will probably tend to proceed concurrently with rather than to lead economic development. Similarly, mobilisation of private savings by governmental loan offerings for capital investment will remain out of the question until the current value of savings is very substantially enlarged and prevailing rates of interest reduced to more reasonable levels. Mean while, the Syrian Government can do much to prepare for the basic budgetary budgetary operations. reforms that must eventually be undertaken, by informing itself, and the general public, more precisely and promptly as to the nature of its actual only a negligible proportion of its public revenues for developmental purposes. On the budgetary side, the Syrian Government is currently allocating 5On the &amp;rchange side, ohe Syrian authorities have no detailed knowledge of their balance oi payments position. The current rate of imports appears uO depend mainly on three key exports, wheat, wool and cotton, together with miscellaneous receipts arising out of a variety of brokerage transactions. Al'.sough the Syrian Government might have attempted to divert a certain percentage of these exchange receipts to capital requirements, it has in fact recently chosen to remove virtually all import licensing controls, as as the remaining exchange restrictions. Government officials explain such final abandonment of earlier control efforts in terms of the impcssioility of effective administration and the risk of losing brokerage tmiso.coions dependent upon a free exchange market. However, this policy amounts to a confession of inability to secure more exchange for development pUi-po^es than the sterling derived from the Iraq Petroleum Company and the dollar expenditures of the Trans-Arabian Pipeline Company. Moreover;, the availability of Trans-Arabian Pipeline dollar receipts for development,a-*- purposes is further restricted by the government's current effores to strengthen the gold reserve backing of the currency which is at tnc moment based primarily upon franc balances accumulated during the war .years. Although a modicum of exchange stability has prevailed during recent months, the decision to reinforce the currency backing would seem a wise The sooner adequate reserve backing is provided, the sooner will i^yria De Q-f’lc to effect an official stabilisation of the present floating exchange rate and thereby render its market more attractive to foreign investors. Syria’s long-term development possibilities are impressive. Her boundaries include territories which are thinly inhabited today, but were rendereri ferbale in antequity by irrigation and could be again. The existence of these highly promising resources lays upon the Syrian Govern ment the imperative duty of exploiting such possibilities to the fullest on behalf of the Syrian people. 6Iraq possesses a potential of economic development holding greater promise than that of any other country surveyed by the Mission. Alone among the Middle East countries, Iraq, has both undeveloped resources in the form of water and potentially fertile land, and substantial exchange earnings from oil royalties accruing directly to Government account, with which capital development might be financed. In brief, the economic problem of Iraq is one of translating oil revenues into the rehabilitation of the Tigris-Euphrates valley. Until now, however, the financial resources available to the State from not only oil royalties but also war-time accumulated sterling balances have been very largely devoted to financing consumption imports and the ordinary operating expenses of the State. Such dissipation of irreplaceable capital assets upon current consumption demands is largely explainable in the terms of the same basic difficulties that retard progress elsewhere in the Middle East. Thus the Iraqi economy has as yet been unable to develop any substantial flow of monetary savings. Even the use of money is confined to a relatively small proportion of the population. The budgetary system of the country is primitive, the tax base narrow, and the Government's credit position is weak. Scarce exchange resources are allowed to go to waste on luxury inports. To compensate for these failings, the Government has been forced to draw heavily upon its capital assets. If Iraq is ever to allocate a significant share of its oil royalties to economic development, therefore, the Government must first seek to cover a much higher percentage of its operating expenses from a broadened and more productive tax base. The growth of deposit banking and other institutional expressions of a monetary economy.should be encouraged. Public confidence in the governmental financial position should be strengthened by reform of present budgetary techniques. Luxury imports must somehow be reduced and the exchange resources so released diverted to capital account.8 Iraqi resources have been veil surveyed and, with the important exception of basic agricultural research^ there is sufficient knowledge of many technical possibilities to v. r arrant the early inauguration of a development programme. It is unlikely, however, that this programme will ever gain momentum without the initial stimulus of foreign assistance and technical advice. But v/ith adequate reform of its finances, Iraq might at a relatively early date succeed in fully financing its exchange requirements for capital imports through the earmarking of oil royalties for this purpose. In this connection, the degree of convertibility into local currencies of its sterling receipts from oil royalties will unquestionably prove of crucial importance. Jordan is by far the least developed of any of the Middle East economies surveyed by the Mission. All of the shortcomings of the Syrian and Iraqi economies with respect to income, savings, exchange earnings and developmental progress apply with much greater force to Jordan. For years the country has relied upon British subsidies for coverage of a major proportion of its import requirements. And now Jordan must be considered for all practical purposes as one with Arab Palestine. Into this new geographical unit of Jordan-Arab Palestine there have fled refugees numbering from one-third to one-half of a total population now swelled to nearly one million. In other Middle East countries, this refugee problem can be dissociated from long-term development considerations. Not so in Jordan, whose Government aupears to contemplate the settlement not only of the refugees it is harbouring today, but even of more, provided the necessary means can be supplied from abroad. During the past year, the annual British subsidy has been supplemented not only ‘by United Nations relief assistance but also, and perhaps most important of all, by the redemption against sterling of Palestine Currency Board notes brought in by the Palestinian refugees. But this last-named resource., which has reportedly provided Jordan vath approxi mately £12 million, is rapidly approaching exhaustion. Unlessadditional exchange resources may be found, Jordan will accordingly face the inevitable necessity of severe import cuts with consequent deepening of its present poverty, and a possible heavy toll of human suffering. Jordan’s immediate problem is to adopt short-term measures of economic survival which may lead into progressive economic development* Lebanon . In comparison with Syria, Iraq and Jordan, the Lebanese economy undoubtedly provides a significantly higher standard of living for its population. Although agriculture is a basic source of income as in the other Middle East economies, Lebanon’s relatively advantageous position has been primarily achieved through the extensive service transactions which Lebanese merchants undertake on behalf of foreign markets. Transhipments through the well-equipped port of Beirut to neighbouring countries, gold brokerage fees, exchange and commodity arbitrage, etc. all contribute to comparatively substantial earnings of hard as well as soft currencies. The merchant tradition of Lebanon has in turn encouraged a much more extensive growth of modern financial institutions than may be found in Syria, Iraq or Jordan. Money savings are higher, interest rates tend to be lower, and the general flow of credit, to productive enterprise less restricted. But here again one encounters the familiar difficulty that the State cannot yet command any part of such internal financial resources through public loan offerings for purposes of economic development. Nor does the present heavy reliance of the Lebanese budget upon consumption taxation encourage hope of major allocations of public revenues to capital investment in the near future. On the exchange side, the Lebanese G-overnment abandoned even earlier than Syria all quantitative controls over exchange and import transactions. Exchange receipts passing through official channels are now virtually limited to payments by the Iraq Petroleum Company and the Trans-Arabian pipeline which, currently at least, are inadequate to finance any substantial development programme, such as that required to utilise the promising10 developmental possibilities of the Litani river. As in the case of Syria, moreover, the Lebanese Government has authorised the Banque de Syrie et ^ du Liban to utilise part of the dollar receipts accruing to governmental account for strengthening the gold reserve. It is to be hoped that this policy vd.ll eventually enable Lebanon to effect a firm stabilization of the present floating rate of exchange -v.hich currently discourages foreign investors from assisting Lebanese development. Egypt . Frequent reference has been made in earlier pages to two major obstacles to development, namely, the inadequacy of savings and the difficulty of mobilizing such savings as there are. While these obstacles continue to impede the development of the Egyptian economy, there has, nevertheless, appeared in Egypt an impressive growth of modern linancial institutions which neighbouring countries may advantageously study. Thus, Egypt has succeeded in developing a governmental bond market, in converting much of its external indebtedness into domestic obligations, in substituting governmental paper for exchange assets in the currency reserve, and even in introducing income tax legislation. This institutional progress on the financial side has been facilitated by a concurrent growth of national output and has in turn contributed to the rise in the national income. But such striking developmental gains have apparently failed to yield any perceptible improvement in the individual standard of life. Thus, despite major increases of national output during the past century, the n marginal H group in the Egyptian population, i.e. those afflicted by poverty, illiteracy / and disease, is commonly estimated at around 90%. For example, the vast irrigation works carried out during the last two generations in Egypt have been followed by corresponding increases in population and truly appalling growth of debilitating diseases, such as bilharzia and malaria. It would seem reasonably clear, therefore, that effective solution of the social problem created by such population pressure cannot be entirely assured by further expansion of output and national income. Education and11 ■ r more diversified opportunities for employment must also assist in bringing about a gradual release from ancestral habits, long ingrained in an economy which has so far offered but little choice to the individual. Israel . The case of Israel is sui generis . There one finds a western civilization of the most modern type which is making prodigious efforts to draw life from the barren soil of Palestine. On the financial side, Israel possesses a reasonably well-equipped and -excellently managed banking system, a remarkably high rate of savings, and a smoothly operating budgetary mechanism which has so far succeeded in financing very substantial outlays for developmental and military purposes as well as current operating expenses. In the absence of this vitally important machinery for mobilizing national economic resources, Israel could not possibly have sustained its effort of the past year. But the basic problem now confronting Israel is whether, even with further improvement of its financial machinery, it cor safely absorb immigration at the rate currently contemplated. The stark fact is - that incoming immigrants create, at least initially, heavy demands on both domestic output and foreign exchange resources, while contributing little or nothing to either. Thus, the Israel balance of payments is currently maintained only precariously in equilibrium by foreign contributions, investments, and other capital transfers covering more than 75/^ of current exchange outlay. Furthermore, the most crucial item on the receipts side, the' contributions by world Jewry, evidence a pronounced tendency to decline while foreign exchange requirements for support and absorption of incoming immigrants continue to mount. Even if the contributions of v/orld Jewry do not further decline, the arrival of 150,000 immigrants during 1950 might well open up an exchange deficit approximating 25^ of total exchange requirements. To a very considerable extent, this prospective gap in the Israeli exchange accounts for 1950 could be as satisfactorily closed by partial release of its frozen sterling balances of £25 - 30 million as by larger dollar receipts. ButteaMikk. whether the British Government will find it possible, particularly in view of the pressing repayment demands of its other creditors, to release sterling on the scale required by Israel remains a matter for negotiation between the two gove rnment s c on ce rne d. The exchange outlook for 1951 is even more grave. Although the Israeli authorities express strong hope that rising exports and a growing influx of Connercial investment will prevent a further broadening of the exchange gap, foreign investors have so far evidenced but little interest, while Israeli’s export potential remains highly uncertain. General Financial Outlook . With the exception of Iraq and possibly Egypt, the prospect of early improvement in the domestic and external financial position of the various Middle Eastern countries thus does not appear encouraging. However promising the possibilities of resource develop ment that engineering surveys may reveal, it is most unlikely that major projects can be financed without substantial outside assistance. But so long as the Middle Eastern countries remain economically prostrate, the risks confronting potential foreign investors are likely to outweigh the prospective returns. We believe it improbable, therefore, that private investment from abroad mil supply the generating power required to initiate the developmental process. In this connection, one often encounters the belief that undeveloped countries such as these in the Middle East could attract investment capital simply by undertaking a thorough financial house cleaning. But it is perhaps insufficiently appreciated that the major deterrents to foreign investment, i.e. low and erratic foreign exchange earnings, vulnerable exchange rates, ineffective, budgetary policies, etc., are all rooted in the basic fact of their poverty and can never be entirely overcome so long as this poverty remains. This is a vicious circle common to all undeveloped states: because they are poor they cannot attract foreign investment and because they cannot attract foreign investment they remain poor. 12There is, of course, the possibility of breaking the vicious circle through foreign assistance in the form of grants, or loans on especially favourable terms, for the initial financing of carefully selected development projects. A dynamic process of development will not be generated, however, unless the Governments receiving foreign aid arouse their peoples to work and hope for a better future. Governments must seek to enlighten the public as to its stake in economic development, and thereby deliberately expose themselves to the political demands from which effective reform action will then spring. With such a revival of national effort and rising national income, it may then prove possible gradually to remove the present institu tional obstacles to progress. But effective and lasting financial reforms can only stem from a truly national realisation of their necessity and purpose. The institutional problem naturally varies from country to country, and only a detailed study of each case in the light of specific plans for development could show in precise detail the policies and administrative reforms required. It is possible, however, to indicate the general lines along which all these countries could mobilise more fully their own resources in support of economic development. First, the diversion of some portion of currently earned foreign ex change from expenditure on luxury consumption to capital imports. Second, preparation of exchange stabilisation plans with a view to reducing risks to foreign investment. Third, tax reforms designed to broaden the tax base and to raise a larger proportion of revenue from the higher income groups. Fourth, the establishment of development budgets providing a concrete expression of an agreed development policy and constituting a high priority charge upon the national revenues and receipts. Fifth, improvement of budgetary procedures, including the adoption of cash accounting, and the prompt publication of results. None of these changes can come quickly, nor can they be expected to yield dramatic returns. They wall inevitably encounter determined political~ 'iWJPi and social opposition which will subject governmental leadership to a searching test. Nevertheless, beginnings in these directions are within the competence of all the countries concerned. They are a prerequisite of economic progress. Having rapidly reviewed the whole field in the foregoing sections, we will now go in come detail into certain financial problems confronting the individual countries, taken one by one. These problems have an important bearing upon development prospects. Grants cannot supply all the funds which the countries believe they could usefully employ for development purposes. If the governments decide to proceed with their plans, they may one day be seeking foreign loans on commercial terms. But the extent to which loans can be found abroad for development projects, however well prepared and justified economically these may be, will be largely determined by the borrowing countries’ capacity both to service loans in hard exchange and to meet local currency expenditure on these projects out of their own resources. It is here that the development problem links up with that of public finance throughout this area. IThen considering the drawbacks of prevalent fiscal systems, except in Israel and to some extent Egypt, it may be tempting to condemn these systems root and branch. Certainly, changes making for a more equitable distribution of charges could and should be introduced. It would be well, however, to proceed with caution in this matter. Hasty reforms might result in a dangerous falling off of receipts at a critical juncture. There is virtue in a tax that is understood, easy to collect and difficult to evade. The French saying that a good tax is an old tax, deserves to be pondered. The whole question should be gone into exhaustively, and inno vations tried out in practice, as far as possible, before reliance is placed upon income tax as the main source of receipts, capable of taking the traditional place of customs duties and taxes on consumption. The same maybe said of other administrative reforms which are being urged upon govern ments: not too much at a time; and remember that changes are not always necessarily for the better. Moreover, when assessing the probable results of development works in this area, it should not be forgotten that if such projects were to attract a considerable portion of available labour, greatly increased spending habits, rather than a solid improvement in the standard of living, might result, swelling imports and impeding exports by making for higher production costs. A somewhat precarious equilibrium, such as has been achieved in countries like Syria and Lebanon, might be compromised by this process if care were not taken to control it. Much will depend on the quality and continuing availability of the advice governments receive in this connection. The following studies are based on published documents, supplemented by consultation with responsible officials in the capitals which it has been possible to visit for the purpose: i.e. Damascus, Amman, Beirut and Tel Aviv.—-— 1, '' , SYRIA Syria has a customs union with Lebanon. The system is irequently ^ criticised. But on balance, official opinion in both countries appears to bo in favour of maintaining it, while recognising that reconciliation oi the divergent development plans of the two countries may sometimes be difficult. Public Financ e. Like Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon, Syria's traditional policy is to achieve a budget surplus wherewith to feed a reserve fund out of -which emergency expenditure may be met. As in the other countries named, money is still too dear for the State to be able to borrow from the public. Definitive budget accounts are published after audit by the Court of Accounts and approval by Parliament, which normally involves a delay of several years, the most recent now available being those for 1945&gt; v.iien the reserve fund stood at £S 49 M. No provisional returns are made public, useful and illuminating as these would be. Estimates are published, arid always forecast expenditure and receipts in equilibrium: at &lt;£S 125*^ L. tor 1947, £S 127.9 M. for 1948, and £S 130.7 for 1949* I n 1945* the last year for which accounts have been published, actual expenditure on the ordinary budget amounted to £S 99 M., and actual receipts to £S 119 M., leaving an accounting surplus of £S 20 M. It is estimated that in 1946 this surplus declined to roughly £S 13 M., and in 1947 to perhaps £S 6 M.; that a deficit will probably materialise for 1948; but that 1949 will produce a surplus, once more. It will be remembered that expenditure not provided for in the budget is currently being met out of the reserve fund, as to the amount of which, at any given time, no conclusions should be drawn from these figures. It should also be realised that extra-budgetary expenditure so financed is just as inflationary from the monetary point of view as Government borrowings from the Banque de Syrie, although far less harmful from a psychological point of view. There is a dual system of accounts: (a) on an accrual basis, including extra-budgetary items (audited by the Court of Accounts but not submitted to Parliament); and (b) on a cash basis, comprising the budget period (the calendar 1617 year) plus a complementary period of four months (or more if prolonged by Parliament), audited, and submitted to Parliament. Military. expenditure is normally included in the ordinary budget. But an extraordinary military budget, with expenditure totalling 90 M., rendered necessary by the recent fighting, was laid before Parliament in August 1949, and is to be included in the ordinary budget for 1990, in deference to the principle of budget unity. The greater part of the expenditure thus provided for has already been paid out, and has been met from cash balances and advances by the Bank of Syria. Its inflationary impact has been considerably alleviated, however, by the fact that the greater part of the outlay has been spent, not on the local market, but abroad via Prench francs and sterling supplied from the reserves of the Banque de Syrie. Definitive cover for the whole amount has not yet been found. Charges in addition to those figuring in the ordinary budget may fall upon the State in respect of the railways, some of which are owned by the State; of the Post, Telegraph and Telephone (an autonomous enterprise, but which on occasion receives State support); of the Grain Office; of the Agricultural Bank and of the Foreign Exchange Office. Further, there are 'annexed budgets' for the Arab Academy, the Service of Antiquities and the Syrian University, whose deficits figure in the ordinary budget. Occasional loans are made by the Treasury to municipalities, which also borrow (with maturity not exceeding ten years) from the Bank of Syria with the Stated guarantee, the relevant recognisances of debt being eligible for inclusion in the cover for the note issue. Aside from its borrowings from the Banque de Syrie, the State has no debts, foreign or domestic, other than its obligation to pay pensions (figuring in the budget) to retired officials. It is planned to set up an autonomous Pensions Office (with a State subvention) to handle expenditure under this heading.18 The muncipalities f budgets rare published in the Statistical Bulletin, Receipts are provided from local surcharges on ordinary State taxes, as in ^ Prance, No State subsidies are granted to the municipalities, but these may obtain the State’s guarantee on loans from the Bank of Issue (Banque de Syrie), The Syrian State’s budget estimates balanced at .dS 125*8 M* in 1947&gt; the last year for which figures for the municipalities are available, these then amounting to £S 21,7 M. on the revenue side, and ,7S 18,7 M. for expenditure. Neglecting the relatively small fraction of receipts represented by income from public propertjf, and also the fact that actual receipts are usually rather in excess of estimates, the Syrian people thus appear to have contributed dS 147.5 M. for public purposes in 1947, or less than £S 50 per caput of population. State receipts for 1949 are estimated as CS 130./ M. , or about 4% more than for 1947. If it is assumed that municipal receipts increase in like proportion, the total charge still works out at a shade over dS 50 , or between $15 and $1 6 per caput of population. Even if, in 1950, somev/hat more has to be demanded from the tax-payer to cover the extraordinary military expenses referred to above, the resultant burden is not a heavy one, even when considered in relation to a national income estimated by PAO at $100 only per caput . The State possesses large landed estates, chiefly agricultural, most of which it farms out under various systems of tenure, with promise of sale after a stipulated period of tenancy. Foreign Exchange Regime . As in Lebanon, the legal parity of the U.S. dollar is Eg 2.1 85 . But exchange-control restrictions designed to support this rate have gradually been relaxed, until two months agb exporters were permitted to retain the foreign exchange proceeds of their sales abroad without surrendering any part of these to the Exchange Office, importers being left to provide themselves with exchange, to pay for the goods they purchase abroad, on the open market through authorised dealers. Allotments through official channels are now limited to French francs, and some other European softcurrencies. It is noteworthy that customs duties are still calculated, as in Lebanon, on the basis of the official parity (dS' 2.185). This results in substantial reductions in the tariff schedule, in real terms. In these circumstances, the activities of the Exchange Office have greatly fallen off, now being practically restricted to operations effected for the State’s account at the legal parity of £S 2.185* out of resources made up by receiuts from foreign oil companies, whose local currency purchases take place as to 80^ at the official parity (cf. Lebanon). However, there is no legal restriction on the State’s right to buy such foreign exchange e.s it may need on the open market, through the Exchange Office, which is at present in course of transformation into a Stabilisation Fund, devised to fit the changed situation now that exchange dealings have been largely set free. Transactions involving movements of capital still require special permit, and must take place .through authorised dealers. It is recognised that these restrictions are not in fact operative at the moment. The purposes for which exchange is purchased are not strictly scrutinized. The view appears to be that if a flight of capital were taking place on a dangerous scale, this would soon » be apparent. Repressive action might then be called for; but unless and until such a problem arises, it seems preferable not to incur the expense of setting up the complicated organisation that would be required in this connection. At present, residents in Syria are not required to report their exchange holdings, nor are there any restrictions on sales and purchases of exchange inside the country, or on transfers of interest on foreign investments in byrio-* Purchases of dollars appear to take place-directly through Syrian pounds, and not by way of a third currency. This lifting of foreign exchange control is alleged to have stimulated export, and thus to have made for an approach to equilibrium in foreign trade. Imports are still heavily in excess of exports, but this difference is entirely compensated by invisible items and drafts upon reserves. Indeed, it is 1920 asserted that the balance of payments is favourable, although no official or semi-official attempt at working it out appears to have been made. Brokerage, commission and exchange - transactions out of which profits accrue to Syrians are being carried on-the world over, if not on as large a scale as in the case of Lebanon. The Syrian pound has strengthened on the open market, in terms of the U.S. dollar, since transactions have been free. However, a slight discount subsists Yis-'a-vis the Lebanese pound. ho official estimate of gold hoards is available, but their total is believed in some well-informed quarters to be not less than $150 M. This is probably more than they amount to in Lebanon, where there are more inducements to put such money to work. In Syria, there is little dishoarding so far. To hoard gold is an ancestral habit in this country, accustomed as it is to see wealth -in other forms lose its value. Indeed, many Syrians to have recourse to bank overdrafts, for which they pay heavy rates of interest, rather than to invest capital that lies idle in gold, dor the moment, moreover, the alarm caused by the recent disturbances in this area has not altogether subsided. Contracts may not legally stipulate payment in gold; but the gold clause’, (payment in local currency at a rate based on the open market quotation for gold) is permitted. The retention of the £S 2.185 official parity is regarded as important, on the ground that the psychological effect of any departure from it -would be incalculable. All prices are highly sensitive to changes in the dollar quotation, and tViis would apply even to the official rate which everyone knows no longer obtains in ordinary foreign trade transactions. Bank of Issue . The agreements in force between the State and the Banque de Syrie confer upon the latter an exclusive privilege of issuing currency notes, until 1965. This Bank also holds all the State’s free balances, including the reserve fund, and on occasion makes disbursements on the State’s ‘account, though the Finance Ministry normally acts as the State’s cashier, except as regards the Railways, the Post, Telegraph and Telephone, the Agricultural Bank and the Grain Office.21 The Banque de Syrie is also the chief institution engaged in commercial hanking. Apart from the operations of the Stabilization Fund, v/hicn is managed by it, the Banque de Syrie is said to transact some 60,0 (in value) of the country’s exchange deals (at a free rate), and about the same percentage of advance, besides the bulk of short-term bank credit to farmers, the Agricultural Bank’s business being confined to long-term loans, and farmers living in parts of the country not served by any of the Banque de Syrie ’ s eleven branches, having little or no access to credit other than that supplied by money-lenders. The Banque de Syrie also handles aiscounts for the larger houses, these perhaps representing some 20 z /o of Syria’s total volume of discounts. The Banque de Syrie’s discount rate varies from 5/'o to 7/o for throe months bills and advances up to 9 to 12 months, and ivy to 4ao foT rediscounts. It appears that other banks’ charges range appreciably higher than these, and that 30 y or more is currently paid on unsecured loans. Under its agreements with the State, the Banque de Syrie aims at accumulating gold, as and when circumstances permit, to provide cover for ^he note circulation (&amp;S 1 240 M. at November 19) in a proportion of 30/^. -u beginning has been made towards this goal, to the extent of about 5 /j, tne balance now being represented by some 11 to 12 billion French francs, holdings of which are being gradually reduced in agreement with the Banque de France, and by Treasury Bills of the Syrian State, short-term but renewable; these, however, not to represent more than 40y of the total cover. The gold in tne cover is valued at the official parity of $1 = ,fo 2.183, the di-i-ucrcnce caused by application of this rate being made up to the Bank by the State. As in Lebanon, it is not open to the Bank to acquire dollars with the French francs released under the agreement above referred to, but only such European currencies as the Banque de France may designate.22 Syria receives approximately £ 3 M. sterling annually from the Iraq Petroleum Company, For the time 'being, these receipts appear somewhat in excess of open market demands. It has been noted that, since exchange transactions have been practically free (the subsisting obligation, to deliver 10^b of hard exchange purchases to the Fund at the official parity applying actually to a very small proportion of deals) the Syrian pound has rather strengthened on the open market, in terms ol dollar. This is held to be attributable to the following factors: (1) Gold movements are free; (2) Exports are increasing; ( 3 ) Relatively large sterling receipts; (4) Relative budgetary and monetary stability; ( 5 ) The existence of gold hoards in Syria amounting perhaps to the equivalent of some $150 M, Virtually no bank notes being hoarded, and bank deposits being very small, Syrians preferring to pay interest on overdrafts for current needs rather than part with gold, there are no loose masses of Syrian currency at the mercy of speculation, or which might slide about dangerously at uneasy ■ moments. . This state of affairs, contributing though it does to exchange stability, has its serious drawbacks in that it obstructs the mobilization of wealth fci productive purposes. It should be remembered, however, that when oil begins to flew through the Trans -Arabian Pipe Line, dollars in respect of transit and guard fees will accrue to the Syrian Government at a rate which it would be rash to attempt to estimate at the present time. Foreign Trade . Returns for the Syro-Lebanese customs union from 1938 to 1948 inclusive will be found attached. The key for the distribution of customs receipts 56 to Syria, 44 to Lebanon, is regarded as unfair by each country. But no attempt has s^ faxsucceeded in working out a more acceptable method of calculation, or indeed in ascertaining precisely the facts of the case. This would be no easy undertaking, in the circumstances, it must be admitted. It will be recalled that visible exports play a much larger part in Syria's balance of payments than in Lebanon’s. Syria, indeed, is an exporter of primary products, especially wheat-. Syrian raw cotton also commands a good price on the market; an increase in it has done something towards offsetting this year's decrease in recerpts from sales of wheat, due to readjustment of prices. Exports for 1949 promise to reach a satisfactory total. Skins and hides contribute, and to a lesser extent cotton goods and worked leather. A roi gh and ready calculation, believed in Syria not to be far from the mark, sets the two countries’ imports at 30 &gt;j of the total each, and Syria’s exports at 75&gt; as against Lebanon’s 25p. Lebanon has attempted to further the setting up of some industries since the war, but Syria, has gone much farther in this direction, and. is on the whole better equipped for the purpose, although some initiatives have not turned out to be justified economically, and indeed are considered as failures, not meriting the protection that has been granted to them. In one important branch, i.e. cement, new works now being set up at Aleppo are exmected shortly to start producing at a rate of 200 tons daily, which added to an even quantity produced at Damascus should supply Syria's normal needs at the present rate. The price at the works is OS 'HQ the ton, and delivered in the country is OS 119 the ton. This position compares favourably with that ruling in Jordan, for instance. Cotton goods are exported, in some coarser grades, mainly to Iraq; but fine qualities have to be imported. Syria produces a very small quantity only of raw silk, importing the bulk of the thread it spins. It is believed in Syria that smuggling, inevitable given the country’s long and open frontiers, mainly brings in manufactured goods via Jordan, in24 order to avoid the Syrian tariff: a further argument, in some eyes, for lowering the rates of numerous duties. /r State of Bus ines s and Prospec ts. Deflationary pressure is at work on prices in Syria. Wheat deserves special mention. L drop, said to amount to 60^b from the war-time peak, has occurred in adjustment to present world prices; hut the new price still permits the producer to cover his expenses. Moreover, this decline seems to have provided a healthy stimulus to export. Less severe price declines are occurring in other fields, tending to create some un employment and wage-rate cuts. But the present situation is not viewed with alarm by the authorities. Taking a longer view, there are difficult problems to be tackled before more opportunities for gainful employment can be given to a population whose current standard of living represents an ever-present tlireat of political and social instability. Public.works for development on a large scale would be required in order to increase the cultivated area. There is no lack of land which might be made fertile, of water for the purpose; or of ra.in-fed 0 x 003 which only require mechanization. The question is: where to find money for capital outlay? It has been seen that interest rates ranp-e high, and that there is an inveterate habit of salting away profits by hoarding gold, not a few people apparently managing to run their business on the margin between the high rates paid for borrowed money and the return obtained from it. In these circumstances, chances of tempting Syrians to invest in agricultural development projects must look remote. Given Syria’s potentialities, and an exchange position that has improved and may well impi’ove still further when dollars from the Trans-Arabian Petroleum Company start coming in, foreign capital might in favourable circumstances seek employment here. Money wages in industry arc low, it is true, but so is the individual worker’s output. Strikers i'n the Aleppo cotton25 a 0 ) mills have been demanding that no individual r/orker should he required to tend more than one loom, as against three at present (and an average of forty in the U.S.A. ). In terms of production costs, factory labour is dear in Syria. Also, the workers, organised in unions, can press their demands in an effective manner. These demands might be expected to become even more insistent were there to be a substantial influx of foreign capital, with resultant threats to the present precarious balance between wa.ges and prices, and an equally fragile equilibrium in the balance of payment. Given these conditions, a new industry requires tariff protection, in order to make a beginning, at a rate which in its turn makes for excessive prices even for internal consumption, let alone competing on foreign markets. The well-worn argument seeking to justify high trices a.t home on the ground that they permit export at competitive rates is hardly convincing in Syria’s ca.se. Development plans appear to be limited at present to projects for building a modern port at Latakia, draining works in the Ghab marshes (Orontes valley) and an electric power station on the Yarmuk. Even these plans are in an early stage of preparation.A visit to Baghdad could not be arranged for the purposes of this study, which therefore had to be based on published material, unsupplemented by fuller and more recent information such as was made available in the capitals of other countries, Iraq attained full national status in 1932, being the second of the countries now under review to achieve it. Its currency unit, the Iraqi Dinar, is linked to the pound, and of the same official parity. The foreign exchange receipts, amounting to some of its budget in 1* which the State derives from the companies exploiting Iraq*s rich oil deposits, are in sterling. Pending the setting up of a Central Bank, now in course of formation, the currency is administered by a Board, meeting in London; and note circulation is covered by sterling securities. Petroleum production is capable of being greatly expanded; prospective reserves ensure Iraq a place of increasing importance among the oil countries of the world. Also, the rain-fed area of the North is only partially exploited, and the alluvial soil of the Mesopotamian plain is fertile. If the country can adequately utilise and control its’immense water resources, its potential as an exporter of food appears great indeed in relation to the present quantities exported. The sane applies to the possibility of its supporting a far larger population than the present. This .was found by the first real census ever taken in'the country” to be 4,8 million only in 1947, fo** an area of 435,228 square kilometres. The rate of natural increase may be about p.a. Both birth and dqath rates, and especially infant mortality, are believed to be high. Of all the countries in this area, Iraq seems to be the one whose natural conditions and hold out the greatest promise, provided the loss of cultivable land caused by ages of neglect can be made good. But at present its people’s standard of living is exceedingly low, national income per caput being estimated by FAQ at #85. as against #100 for Syria and #125 for Lebanon. At least 6C£o of the national income is estimated to be derived from agriculture. The peasant is burdened by taxes and an inequitable profit-sharingPublic Finance . Iraq has an ordinary budget, and an extraordinary one, including development schemes only, financed chiefly by oil royalties* In addition, there are several State-owned enterprises, e*g* the railways, having independent budgets of their cam* The aggregate expenditure of these cannot be given, but is stated not to be relatively large. Pull information is not available as. to the extent to which the State may be called upon to make good their losses. Estimates require parliamentary approval, and accounts are audited by a. semi-independent department. Cash results of the ordinary and extraordinary (development) budgets have been seen in published form down to and including 1946-47 (the financial year enaing on .31st March as in the U.K, ), Estimates only can be given for 1947-48 and 1948-49: Ordinary + or - .

National defence and police together'accounted for just under one-third of expenditures, before the recent fighting. 28Ho audited each results or even provisional returns are available for the last two years listed. Serious strain was imposed upon Iraq by the Palestine war. The closing of the Haifa pipeline caused a heavy fall in S receipts from oil royalties. The difficulty of budgeting in these circumstances led the Government to proceed, in by two-monthly estimates. It appears that by May, 1949, the Iraqi Government had incurred a debt amounting to several million Dinars, including an internal loan authorised in 1947# The chief leaders were the banks. Also, advance payments on oil royalties have been obtained. Negotiations are in progress for loans from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and other sources. As in other countries in this area, the Government is unable to borrow on any significant scale from its own public, the rates of interest obtainable on private loans being so high as'to attract all available capital. The end of hostilities has doubtless brought some relief, A relatively light charge is incumbent upon Iraq in respect of Palestinian Arab refugees, v/hose numbers appear not to be in. excess of 4 3 000, The long-range view is brightened by the prospect of increasing oil royalties. However, the sums devoted to development in the extraordinary budget are as yet inconsiderable in relation to the task of equipping the country on a scale worthy of its unparalleled potentialities. Foreign Trade . According to Iraqi statistics, the value of exports (not including oil) is normally less than one-half of imports, but this difference appears to be partly accounted for by overvaluation of imports (at internal wholesale prices rather than on a GIF basis) u However, when all allowances for this practice have been made , ther'^. remains a large import balance, which is covered chiefly by receipts from oil companies. Exports consist mostly of foodstuffs and raw materials: barley, dates, hides, wool, and live animalsj imports, of textiles, machinery and vehicles, construction materials and equipment. Prior to 1939, the U.K,, U.S.A,, Japan and Germany accounted for 50^ of the foreign trade. During the war, these countries 1 shares were heavily reduced, or discontinued altogether, their places being taken by India and other Middle Eastern markets® Since the war, Indiahas maintained its share; those of the other Middle Eastern countries have fallen off, and the U*K # , U.S # A. and Italy are in process of recovering their earlier position c Transit trade with Iran was formerly half as large as Iraq* s whole foreign trade; but it has decreased sharply of late. According to the Iraq Statistical Abstract, 19V7 » foreign trade may be summarized as follows, in millions of Dinars: Exports Year Imports Local Re-exports Total Balance 1 938 9.4 3*5 0.3 3.7 - 5.7 1941 6.9 3.9 0.3 4.2 - 2.7 1943 15.7 9.1 0.3 9.4 - 6.3 1946 28.0 12,7 0.4 13.1 - 14.7 1947 39o9* 13*8 0.9 14.7 - 25.2 *Cif valuation Balance of Payments . For several years before the war, this had been calculated (the period being the financial year), ^uid the work was resumed in 1947- to cover 1946, now on a calendar year basis, A calculation has been made for 1 947&gt; tui is withheld, apparently for security reasons. The three pre-war years showed import surpluses amounting to roughly ID 2,9 M,, ID 4*6 M, and ID 5*2 M, respectively, and a deficit on services and interest, partly offset by profits and brokerage on transit and export trade, transport fees, British military expenditure, pilgrim traffic and tourist expenditure, and above all by oil royalties, which rose from ID 900,000 in 1936/37 to ID 1,968,000 in 1938/39* But a current account deficit still persisted; ID 2 e 3 M, in 1937/38 and ID 1 e 4 M, in 1938/39* It was covered by investments of the Iraq Petroleum Company, a Governmental loan of £1 M, negotiated in the U,K, raid drawings upon short-term assets in London, The balance of payment for 1946 may be summarized as follows;** 30Item A.

There is nevertheless a deficit on current account, and adverse gold movements, largely covered by drawing down Iraq’s sterling balances to the extent of nearly ID 3 M. This process has been accelerated until the total of Iraq 1 s sterling balances in May, 1 949 is believed to have been some £9 M e only in excess of the amount required for 100/; currency cover. The sharp rise in money incomes during the war, unaccompanied by an expansion in b e supply of goods, resulted in a rapid increase of prices, despite a • ariely of measures designed to combat inflationary x^ressure. After the end of the war. a moderate decline in prices occurred; but crop failure and a rise in world prices reversed this movement during 194-7. Although there hassince been some improvement, the wartime dislocation of the price and cost structure has by no means been rectified* Problems and Prospects * Broadly speaking, it may be said that oil developments in Iraq are in the hands of the companies, Agrciulture, on the other hand, provides the livelihood of the great mass of the population; and here the Iraqi Government is responsible for devising and carrying out an appropriate policy, capable of raising a standard of living which is deplorably low. So far, few minerals other than oil have been discovered in Iraq, apart from some indications of copper in the northeast part of the country. Industry cannot make a great contribution to the national wealth, at ary rate for a long time to come. Prospects of improvement depend largely upon increasing the area under cultivation, and by cultivating a larger area per caput , e,g, by mechanisation. At present only one-fifth of Iraqis territory is cultivable, and of this only a small part is cropped in any one year. The Irrigation Development Commission, working from 1946 to 1949 under the presidency of Mr, F,F, Haigh, made a general survey and prepared detailed plans for many projects in the first stage of development. These projects are set forth in App. IV, Hydra-electric power may be developed by some of them, the estimated total cost being over ID 90 M, If these works could be finished, an appreciable betterment of the Iraqi people*s lot would doubtless be the result. The total involved is a relatively large one, and conpletion of the schemes would require many years. Increases in Iraq's exchange receipts might expedite the process. But in any case, questions would arise as regards Iraq's capacity to produce its own currency to meet the very large part of the expenditure that would be spent on wages and otherwise, locally, without incurring danger of inflation; and also to earn hard-currency to service loans to pay for such equipment as it might have to purchase outside the sterling area. 3233 THE HASHEMITE KINGDOM OP JORDAN ■ and ARAB PALESTINE : The Refugees . In Jordan, there is no getting away from the refugee problem. It dominates the scene at every turn. No plans can be made without taking account of it. Also, -whatever the formal position may be, from a practical point of view, Jordan and Arab Palestine must be considered as a whole There are varying estimates of the numbers of refugees in this area. But 'whether they represent one-third or one-half of the total population does not • i 1 signify so much as that they are mostly destitute, and deteriorating in every way as ime goes on. The territories they are living in are barren and the government lacks the means to keep them on a relief basis, let alone the capital outlay that would be necessary to enable them to earn a livelihood. It is calculated that absorption would cost £P 700 for each family of five persons, Incidentally, this works out at about $400 per caput, as against the Israeli estimate of $ 2 , 500 : a difference, however, which is understandable given the respective backgrounds. Thus, for example, 50,000 Jordan-Arab Palestine families, a minimum number to be considered, whether or not refugees go elsewhere, would require about £P 35 M,, to which it is said that a further sum of say £P 5 M, would have to be added for hospitals, schools and other public services. Opinions differ as to how many refugees the Jordan-Arab Palestine area could take, given the necessary outlay on development. But there seems to be a general willingness to try to absorb all those who cannot go elsewhere. This is an important factor in the whole refugee situation, whatever reserves may have to be made as to the possibility of securing funds for the purpose. There is insistence in Jordan on the wastefulness of spending at the present rate on mere relief, thus leaving the future as black as before, when a relatively modest outlay on definitive settlement might mean some real progress, and gradually reduce the need for relief. It is argued that if an initial sun of sa^ from £P 6 M. to £P 10 M. could be provided as a grant, muchmight be done towards supplying a production basis for later borrowing on commercial terms, which it is realized is out of the question as things stand at present. An interest-free loan of one million sterling recently granted by £ the U.K, is not large enough to enable a serious beginning to be made in this direction. But its importance is by no means underrated in Jordan, on the present situation, when there is urgent need for spending more than can be supplied by the budget for such purposes as public health, schools and irrigation. It is claimed, however, that the present budget marks some nrrprovement over previous years, in this respect, Jordan 1 s Finances . Jordan’s finances are being managed largely without reference to the refugees. It must be admitted that it would be hopeless to attempt to budget on the assumption that Jordan would have to support the refugees by its own unaided efforts. There is, however, outside the budget, a Jordan refugee fund, fed by a special stamp—tax, occasional contributions from other Moslem states, and a vote of £P 70,000 in Jordan^ current budget itself. Altogether, it is estimated that Jordan’s reiugee expenditure is running at an annual rate between £P 170,000 and 200,000, This, of course, is an insignificant amount in comparison with the U.N, contributions from other sources. But it should be recognised that the disruptive impact of the influx of refugees cannot be measured in terms of state expenditure, Jordan’s ordinary budget (estimates for the year to 3*1 3 'k March, 1950) balances at roughly £? 2 .3 M. The last year for which closed accounts (audited by a department of the Finance Ministry) are available is 1947/^. It produced a surplus of half-a-million £P. The ordinary budget for 1943-49 is said to have ended with a surplus also, though a smaller one. The actual Treasury position, within the narrow limits of its application, is described as not causing anxiety at present. But in order to give a more comprehensive view of the country’s financial position, even if the refugee problem is left aside, it must be added that since Jordan forces- h a ve been occupying Arab Palestine, there has been a separate budget for that area, which balances for this current year at £? 1.1 M. (estimates), and that the U.K. is subsidisingthe Arab Legion (except for the Hashemite regiment, provided for in the budget) at an annual rate of £P 2.5 M, or 3 M. Thus out of total state expenditure of about £P 6 M., the U.K seems still to be contributing over 1+0/:• The Government treats its budget surpluses as an emergency fund out of which, inter alia , it buys crops which farmers are' otherwise unable to market, selling them as occasion offers. No accounts of these transactions are published. Balance of Payments . When it comes to attempting to cast a balance of payments, Jordan’s dependance on the U.K. becomes even more striking than appears from the budget. As against some £P 9 M. imports for which foreign exchange is being provided by the Jordan authorities, there seems, according to offical estimates, to be a small fraction of one million only representing exports. Together with expenses of foreign legations and other minor items, exchange incomings may perhaps amount to something in the neighbourhood of £P 1.4 M. to be added to say £P 3 M. contributed by the U.K. for the army, leaving about £P 4.5 M., which during the past year has been made up by depletion of sterling balances, latterly swollen by large amounts of Palestinian currency imported by refugees, backed 100)1 by sterling* There seems to be little prospect of this position being rapidly changed for the better by improved administrative methods. Whatever can be done gradually in that direction will require a solution of the refugee problem, and also increased educational opportunities, and will hardly affect the immediate position. As things stand at present, not only can Jordan make no appreciable financial contribution towards tackling its refugee problem, but it needs help on a relatively large scale to become sel f-supporting, on the lowest level, and will go on needing it for a’long time even if the financial burden represented by the refugees is carried by others. Demands for allotments of import exchange are being pressed, which if yielded to would increase imports from the present level of £P 9 M* yearly to £P -12 M,, while it is wished to reduce the figure first to £P 8 M,, and then gradually to£P 6 M c As indicated above, current levels of imports are beinglargely financed by depletion of sterling balances acquired against redemption of Palestinian currency brought in by the refugees* Irap°*'ts thus financed have been primarily of the consumers’ goods variety and,- although temporarily alleviating inflationary pressure, have contributed little or nothing to the productive capacity of Jordan. The important capital asset represented by the sterling balances acquired by redemption of Palestinian currency has thus been largely wasted. Despite the approaching exhaustion of J or clan * s sterling balances available for financing import surpluses, there appears, to be continuing pressure for even more liberal* allocations of exchange. It is not generally realised that the Palestine Arabs, instead of paying Jordan for its produce in exchange thereby making for a balanced foreign trade, as formerly, have increased the number of mouths that must be fed inside the country, which now includes the wretchedly poor parts of Palestine that are still Arab, without adding to productive capacity. It is argued in official circles that resumption of trade with Israel, in present circumstances, would create grave problems, as the intercourse would tend to-develop spending habits in Jordan, which are already excessive in the light of what the country can reasonably afford, burdened as it is by the adverse factors enumerated above, and by the expense of keeping up the apparatus of a state based on so small a productive population. ' Before passing on, it will be recalled that termination of the British mandate involved Jordan* s exclusion from the sterling area. The Government plans to introduce a new currency in 1950: the Dinar, equal to the pound sterling, and hopes to re-enter the sterling area at the same time. This position largely determines Jordan’s economic policy. It is indeed clear that, dependent as it is for its living on the U.K,, Jordan must conform, to the required extent, with the pattern' that prevails in the sterling area. But its circumstances are such that the question arises whether it is necessary or desirable that this struggling little country should attempt to inpose regulations which are not and cannot be enforced. The aim is to curb imports and stimulate exports. But this system subsidizes inports by'allotting 36 -exchange at cheaper than conmercial rates, and penalises lav/ful export by demanding that the exchange proceeds be surrendered at a corresponding rate, the result being that exports leak out across frontiers which are too long to be effectively patrolled, and the fisc never sees the resultant exchange. It is difficult to discern in v/hat respect complete liberty would not be preferable to, or at least less wasteful than, the present state of affairs. Prospects . In a situation such as Jordan’s, the official mind, harassed as it is by problems pressing in from all sides on so small a community, readily turns to broader horizons. There is a tendency to assert that no radical improvement can be brought about unless Jordan forms part of a union comprising Syria and Iraq, and eventually Lebanon as well. This aspiration raises political issues falling outside the scopje of the present inquiry, which must take for granted the frontiers that exist to-day. If consideration be limited to economic factors and to Jordan and Arab Palestine alone, it will be seen that development designed to make the state viable should proceed on four lines: (1) Expansion of agricultural production to absorb refugees, gives a higher standard of living to the local population and provides certain cash crop exports. This in turn involves the setting up of processing industries. * (2) Such development of minor local industries as seems possible, partly with a view to providing some exports, but more in order to reduce imports. ' ‘ ■ , . A . (3) Development of transport facilities, since transportation is at present a very heavy item in the cost of imports and a bottleneck for both imports and exports, ( 4 ) Export of such raw materials as the country possesses, a development with which transportation is closely linked. In addition, the development of a primitive industry is desirable in order to give work to the population of Amman, which has risen from 23,000 before World War II to about 100,000 to-day, and. thus gradually to form experts and engineers of whom there is a great dearth in the country.^8: The economy of Jordan and Arab Palestine is essentially agricultural; in the main, cereals are grown and in certain years the country is an exporter of these. But a cereal economy can be adversely affected by climatic conditions and the alternation of bad and good yearsJc It has, therefore, been strongly recommended by various specialists that Jordan should develop its agriculture by substituting fruit growing: olives, grapes, etc., on a considerable scale, for cereal cultivation, particularly on land which is in any case obviously marginal for ordinary crop production. The soundness of such a policy is illustrated by what has already been accomplished in this direction in north Jordan and in parts of Arab Palestine, Only by such means can much of the poor land throughout the country support a larger population or even provide a reasonable livelihood for those already depending on it for their existence, The development of fruit growing and intensive cultivation of vegetables and fruits in the Jordan Valley can be made possible by a number of schemes already in plan for the better utilisation of the country t s waters. With these must be coupled the expansion of government horticultural stations and nurseries and the development of processing industries, which (like better road facilities) are necessary in order to utilise the products of a more developed agriculture. Among such industries, vegetable canning is considered a promising investment. At the present time transportation difficulties result in the loss of large quantities of perishable crops which, if preserved, might help to keep down prices in the off-season. It is thought also that a sugar industry might be developed in the Jordan Valley and that there Is room for expansion in the utilization of dairy products. The parts of Palestine which have not been occupied by Israel are on the whole poor and barren, but vines and olives grow there. Industries must, therefore, be developed to utilize their product, particularly since these fruits are excellently suited for an expansion of planting on terraoes, the building of which is already planned. It is not likely that the local wine will ever compete internationally, butgrapes can also be turned into non-alcoholic grape juice, for which there is a market. For olive oil there is always a demand; pressing plants would be remunerative. Still larger use of the product of the olive tree could be found by the modernization and expansion of the existing soap industry at Nablus, Here comparatively good grade soap is already produced. With technical assistance and some capital, the industry might become a large one. It does not seem probable that the existing tobacco industry can be greatly expanded. In the second field, that of the development of local industries with a view to reducing imports, the most important item is unquestionably cement. None is mad^ in Jordan at present; it has to be imported from such far away countries as Czechoslovakia or Yugoslavia via Beirut, At Amman it is sold at an official price of £F 22 per ton, mostly made up of freight. As middle-men ol ten manage to comer the supply, it is said, cement may change hands at as much as £P 40 per ton. Suitable stone is available near Amman and some progress has been made towards setting up a company. This should have an important effect in reducing Jordan*s imports. It may also be possible to develop brick-making and temning. In connection with these industries, transport facilities must clearly be developed. Plans exist for the improvement of a road net-work throughout the country designed to draw off the products of agriculture and provide access to industrial sites (in particular to minerals), and to open up the remarkable antiquities of the country in order to develop tourism. Comparatively minor expenditure on locomotives and workshops would greatly improve the railways. The crucial point, however, is the, siting of a port. At the moment, the cost of transport via oeirut is a heavy handicap. There is support in Jordan for substituting a North—bouth axis (Amman—Aqaba, in Jordan territory) for the East-West one (Aqaba-Beirut) upon which the country now depends. Although the distance between capital and port is roughly the same in both cases, it is evident that what would be spent on the Amman-Aqaba haul (in addition to port dues and landing charges) would remain in Jordan instead of being spent abroad as it is on the Amman-Beirut line. Fish-canning could be developed at Aqaba, The difficulty is that the railway from Amman is only built as far as a pointsome 50 miles north of Aqaba and that this last section would be costly to build and to double by a modern road because of mountainous country and bad ^ climatic conditions. However, a road to Aqaba is included in the road development scheme of v the Jordan Government, State ownership of small veoselo to ply between Aqaba and the Suez Canal is already contemplated. An important source of raw materials for Jordan may be her minerals; and it is clear that a very early priority in the country’s development must be a detailed geological survey. One mineral, however, is already well-known. Within 18 Kms. of the capital, and also on the railway further south, there are vast deposits of phosphate which are already exploited, on a small scale. For the large-scale export of unprocessed phosphate (on which negotiations have been proceeding for some time), the limiting factor is the high cost of transport. It is said that with an outlay of from £P 150,000 to 200,000, super phosphate could be produced locally, thereby largely solving the transport problem. The other raw material .within reach of the Jordan Government is potash. It may be recalled that an Anglo-Palestine Company was operating two potash plants on the Dead Sea before the recent troubles: one at the south end, one at the north, the product being barged up from the southern to the northern plant, and trucked thence to the rail-head at Jerusalem. The. southern plant is on the Israeli territory, and is intact, but is not working because there is, at present, no way of moving the product out. The northern plant lies on Arab territory; but it was completely wrecked during the recent hostilities. Keen regret is expressed over this wanton destruction of plant needed to manufacture a valuable product, but there appear to oe no plans at present for repairing the damage.LEBANON Need for Development. Lebanon’s population is increasing rapidly. Estimates vary: according to some, the present figure of about 1,200,000 will be doubled in ten years; others say twenty years. There is unemployment already. The trend threatens to deteriorate dangerously unless increased opportunities for earning a livelihood are provided in time, which will require outlay on a relatively large scale. This would be the case even if all the Palestinian refugees now in Lebanon were moved elsewhere. Their continued presence in the country, however, would aggravate a situation which exists independently of them. The Lebanese G-overnment is indeed contemplating a six- year programme, thus recognising the importance of this problem. Finance may be forthcoming to carry out some projects on terms that do not make it necessary to inquire closely into Lebanon’s ability to obtain a long term loan abroad, and then to service it. But the extent to which such prospects can be counted upon is uncertain. It appears urgent to consider what the country could do, by its own efforts, to improve its cnances of successfully addressing itself to the market. Lebanon's financial capacity is remarkable, relatively, although it has not operated hitherto so much to the advantage of the State as to that of xxr’ivn L-e individuals. The Lebanese have proved their ability to turn their little country into an.active and efficient centre for exchange, gold dealings, brokerage and trade involving many currencies besides their own, and the movement of goods which may never touch Lebanese territory. In November 1946, the authorities encouraged these activities by removing in practice the remaining restrictions on sales and purchases of exchange. While an official parity of 218.50 Lebanese piastres (2.185 Lebanese pounds) to the U.S. dollex has been maintained, and is still applied to certain governmental transactions, the rate is left to take care of itself where private business is concerned, and now stands at about $1,00 = 520 Lebanese piastres.Under the Syr o-Lebanese customs-union, it appears to be impossible to ^ determine the respective shares of the two partners in visible trade with the rest of the world. There are no official returns illustrating the siso of * Lebanon’s invisible dealings. Profits earned on them go to private firms a.nd individuals a.nd not to the State, and largely escape taxation. No balance of payments estimate having an officia.l or even semi-official character is available. But some notion of the invisible items 1 relative importance nay be ga.ined from a passage in the Bank of Issue's Report for 1948 where it is stated that Lebanon’s excess of visible import over export vaducs, huge as it is, constitutes 'a minor factor in the balance of accounts, which is substantially favourable'. Lebanon’s State budget lias shown a surplus of receipts for several years past, this however being a fact from which it would not be safe to draw conclusions as to the country's financial policy. The note circulation stands at about LL 170 million, having declined slightly over the past year. Provisional estimates indicate that upwards of £L 93 million in budget receipts were collected in 1948. It appears that the fiscal effort demanded of the country in 1949 and 1950 will be less heavy, to allow for a busincos recession, on the degree of 'which there is no general agreement, buo which is indicated by a contraction of the note-issue. In these circumstances, it might at first sight be tempting for a Government to try to collect a share of the hard exchange earned by Lebanese nationals ana residents. Ent thio c -ule only be done by coercive measures, which would have the effect of driving lucrative transactions away• Lebanon has attracted this business from ocher centres where skills, economic information and experience may not be equal to those possessed in Beirut, but which would undoubtedly recover the cre^dc it Lebanon attempted to anply exchange control.the It is doubtless wise to permit these profits to be made, and to regard / ^fact that the State cannot directly tap them as a lesser evil. But the Government, Y/ithout harming invisible trade, could do more towards building up a financial position that is sound and carries conviction as such because the key facts are readily available. Tv/o thin s might greatly help towards the development projects needed to give work to its increasing population. Lebanon might: (1) put itself in a position to finance some local currency expenditure under development projects out of its own resources: partly out of current receipts, partly by borrowing internally, and ( 2 ) prepare to devote its future hard-currency earnings to servicing foreign loans for the purchase of the equipment required by these projects. Publ ic finance is the first problem in order of urgency, and one which it lies within the power of Lebanon itself successfully to solve. The fact that a surolus is being .produced does not mean either that the fiscal system is well adapted to the country’s needs, or that the State’s finances are being managed in the way best calculated to foster the confidence that would prompt Lebanese citizens and residents to invest their savings in bonds expressed in Lebanese currency, and attract capital from abroad. The undertaking ought not to be discouragingly difficult. L certain degree of confidence in the currency exists already: there is less reluctance to hold domestic bank notes in Lebanon than in some other countries in this area. L bond market does not seem to be an impossible development, here. That is needed is to make the facts available to public opinion by applying the appropriate principles and mechanism, and to improve the fiscal system so as to tap wealth where it can be reached, while increasing the efficiency of the community as a whole by helping its weaker‘sections to reach a reasonable standard of living themselves. The Lebanese budget is.subject to approval by [Parliament, as arc also yearly statements showing how the budget has been executed. The system,however, works very slowly. At present, the nost recent year for which 'definitive results' are available is 19V7. Those for 1948 still await Parliamentary approval. The accounts are not audited outside the Finance Ministry, although there is a hill before Parliament providing for an inde pendent Audit Authority. It is difficult, indeed impossible, to form any opinion on the current trend from the estimates, because (a) these are prepared on an accrual basis, 'expenditure' often including credits which are not spent and 'receipts' including debts to the State which are unlikely to be collected, and (b) recourse has frequently been had to additional credits voted at odd times during the fiscal year. Further, some public services are not included in the State budget at all, and their accounts are not published, although the State is liable for any losses they may incur and should receive any profits they may make. Expenditure for Palestinian refugees and receipts from taxes imposed for this purpose are also outside the budget, and have so far not been published. It would greatly contribute both to strengthen confidence in the currency and to encourage foreign capital to regard Lebanon as a good risk if the principle of budget unity were applied and returns on a cash basis were made available with the ■ least possible delay. It would probably be well, during an initial period, to prepare estimates of cash receipts and expenditures and to publish the corresponding results, on a quarterly or even a monthly basis. This could be done, given the size of the territory, v/ithin a short time of the end of each period once an adequate mechanism had been introduced for determining the resnective shares of Lebanon and Syria in customs receipts. Improvement of the budget mechanism might advantageously be accompanied by a revision of the purposes to 'which expenditure is devoted. This is a question on which hasty judgments would be dangerous; it requires careful study before action is decided upon. But at first sight it is striking that well over one- third of budget expenditure is absorbed by national defence, gendarmerie, police and security, taken together. Further, it appears that the number of45 public employees has trebled over the last ten years. V/hile making due A allowances for the increased tasks assumed by Government, and for a growing population, it seems probable that numbers could be reduced without loss of efficiency. Given the political difficulties that always attend such operations, especially when publicised, and the pensions and separation in demnities that would have to be paid to dismissed employees, the least vexatious and most effective way of dealing with this problem might be to work gradually and unobtrusively towards an appropriate establishment, the number of posts in which would be determined having a strict regard to requirements, and to exercise a vigilant control to ensure that, as present cificials in excess of this establishment die off or are retired, their posts are effectively discontinued. The same remarks probably apply to the municipal buugets, equally if nco more, given that they get less publicity than the State budget. Fiscal policy . It appears difficult at present to estimate the liscal burden per caput of the Lebanese population# The Sta.te budget is given c.s amounting to some 75 million Lebanese pouno.s, and those oi the municipo.lities to about one-half that sum. This would mean about £L 115 million for public expenditure. It would be prudent to allow for additions to this sura in respect of outlay for refugees, losses on public services or other charges on the State; subject to these reserves, the ner caput charge would appear to amount to at least £L 94* or roughly This is a considerable charge, given Lebanon’s wealth and earning capacity, especially if it is not equitably distributed according to the capacity of the various classes of tax-payers. Urban real estate and uminished buildings get off lightly, as do inheritances, gifts or sales of property, and luxury expenditure, e.g. automobiles. On the other hand, unties on maos consumption goods appear to be heavy.Without advocating hasty measures aimed at bringing about radical changes in a minimum of time, or discouraging initiative, and while making allowances for the fact that Lebanon has a customs union with Syria, it seems that the total proceeds of taxation could be increased, and the burden on the poorer sections of the community relieved, by a careful revision of the system, devised to,make the wealthy contribute in a fuller measure to the cost of running the G-overnment. Some Lebanese economists advocate a fiscal reform based mainly on income tax. But it may be doubted, in local conditions, whether income tax could be made to yield on a satisfactory scale in a short time. It v/ould perhans be safer to rely upon taxes on visible property and the like that are better understood, eanier to collect and harder to evade, at least during a transitional period. The Banque d u Liban , which possesses the sole right of note issue, is not a central bank in the full s :rse of the term. It does not have custody of all State balances. This question needs consideration, as does that of prompter and more frequent publication of the significant facts of the Bank’s position, A desirable solution might require renegotiation of contracts. bfrosnecti ve doll ar earning s of the Lebanese Government, out of which eventual hard-currency loans for development purposes might be serviced, are scanty for the time being, but may increase if and when the flow of oil through the Trans-Arabian Petroleum Company’s pipelines begins. The present position seems to be that the Lebanese Government has bought gold with dollars it has so far received from the Trans-Arabian Petroleum Company and has turned this gold over to the Banque du Liban towards building up a backing for the note circulation. The Company is committed for over a year more to paying for 80^o of the Lebanese currency it needs at the official rate of $1 = CL 2*18, Appreciable amounts of dollars may be expected from this source, which appears to have produced 6 million (part of which goes to Syria) since the Company started operations in 1947* As from the time when oil starts to flow through 4b47 m the line, dollars for transit and guard fees should accrue to the Lehanese Government at a minimum annual rate of over $240,000, and these receipts might increase considerably with a greater flow of oil. It is stated that if delimitation and affranchisement of the land required could be promptly finished, construction could be completed and the line put into operation by the end of 1950. If the Company decided to build a refinery at Saida, a further source of dollar receipts would be opened up. The Iraq Petroleum Company cannot be looked to by Lebanon for hard- currency earnings. The fees it pays are in sterling, and are earmarked to buy imports from the sterling zone. Formerly, its requirements in Lebanese currency provided sterling which was available for other purposes, but receipts from this source have been spent, and now that the refinery at Tripoli has been i completed, it appears that local sales of petroleum products will produce all the Lebanese currency this Company needs. There are doubtless other quarters from which dollars may accrue to the Lebanese State, but they are uncertain and, at the best, unlikely to make a significant addition to what is received from the Trans-Arabian Petroleum Company. And receipts are, to a great extent, dependent on the new pipeline being set to work, which, even assuming that the Lebanese authorities show the greatest desire to carry out their part of the operation, and that no delays are caused outside Lebanon's borders, can take place only towards the end of 1950. Conclusion . There seems to be about one year to run before Lebanon will have assured hard-currency receipts on a scale making it worth while to explore the possibilities of obtaining a loan from some institution which has to consider repayment prospects. There is much to do, in this interval, in order that Lebanon should be able to make the most of its opportunity; and the necessary steps can, and indeed must, be taken by Lebanon itself. Ain attempt has been made above to outline the problem. The essential points are that Lebanon cannot hope to borrow abroad for development projects unless: (1) it can prove its ability to provide the requisite local currency out of its own resources;( 2 ) its own State finances are run on the lines best suited to the country’s needs; (3) its State financial position can be determined at any moment by means of up-to-date returns on a cash basis; (4) the projects for which it tries to borrow are realistically chosen and prepared, and are not over-ambitious in relation to Lebanon’s size. Many other things might be done in order to improve conditions in Lebanon, It would be prudent, however, not to pursue too many objectives at the same time, but to concentrate on what must be accomplished in order that the country may carry conviction as a good credit risk. 48EGYPT Egypt is distinguished, in this area, for the promptness with which information on public finance and economic matters is made available. The National Bank publishes a quarterly bulletin giving not its own position at the end of the preceding month only, but the essential data on the execution of the budget, note circulation, bank deposits, prices and foreign trade, A statistical year-book, being on a very comprehensive scale, appears long after the end of the relevant period; the last volume now out is that for 1 943' 19A4-, but a fairly complete Annuaire de Poche is available down to and including 1947. And the National Bank’s publication suffices for main purposes, Egypt*s fiiiancial and economic position is briefly commented upon in the following notes, mainly for the sake of comparison with the other countries dealt with, .■}: Public finance . .Recent returns of budget expenditure and receipts, which include those of the Railway, the Post, Telegraph and Telephone, and £tate enterprises,, appear in the Bank Bulletin,' these being communicated by the Ministry of Finance, quarterly^ and now being available up to the close of the financial year 1943-49 (ending 26th February, 1949). Moreover, the Audit Department (an independent body) works faster than in many other countries: the findings of its report on results for the financial year 1947-1948 were included in the Bank Bulletin for the first quarter of the (calendar) year 1949 . , . , . ! The last two years before the war, when expenditure was running at roughly £E 48 M., produced deficits (fiE 3,6 M, for 1938/39, and £E 2,5 M, for 1939/40), Since then revenue each year has exceeded expenditure, and a reserve fund has been built up, which is officially stated to have totalled £E 76 M, at the close of 1947 / 48 , and may have increased since then, as therp was a surplus of £E 12,7 M, for 1948/49, revenue for that year having risen to t £3 170 M, At this rate, the burden represented by the State budget alone-, -without the municipalities,, amounts to over £E 9 per caput , as compared with a per caput income which has recently been estimated by FAO at roughly /100, The war and50 post-war period has also seen the accumulation of sterling 'balances. Those on No. 1 Account, which is free, amounted to &lt;£E 77 M. on 2nd July, 19^-9, m fell off considerably after that because of traders T anxiety to place orders before sterling prices rose following devaluation, but stand at about £E 70 at present. Those on No# 2 Account (JSE 256,3 M* at 2nd July, 1949) &amp;re blocked, subject to periodic releases, negotiated between the interested governments# Although Egypt is not in the sterling area, to quote the Bank Bulletin, Vol. II, No. 3: “There was no free choice for Egypt when she was put before the alternative to follotr suit or not, a few hours before the decision (to devalue) was made public in London, In the circumstances of Egyptian economy the alternative to the devaluation at the same rate would have been a free-currency. This would have brought. Egypt into conflict with the regulations of the I.M.P. as well as with the Anglo-Financial Agreement. Moreover, Egypt*s foreign currency resources are mainly in sterling • Indeed, the National Bank*s position at 30th September, 1949, shows that, as cover for a note circulation of £E 151 M*, this institution then published gold holdings valued at £E 6.3 M. (practically unchanged since 1939), the balance, £E 144,6 M., consisting of Egyptian and British Government Treasury Bills and securities. Formally, Egypt’s foreign-exchange control system is similar to the; United Kingdom’s, In practice, circumstances make for greater elasticity in Egypt, It is not without significance that travellers are allowed to bring in and take out £J3 20, and that the Egyptian, pound note- has strengthened of late, in relation to sterling, on the Beirut free market. The total circulation increased by leaps and bounds during the war, from £E 31 M. in 1939 to £E 150 M. in 1945, since when there have been minor movements up and down only. Allowing for the increase in population that has taken place in the interval, circulation per caput appears to have risen since 1939 from under £E 2 to over £E 8 . The wholesale price index (June-August, 1939 - 100) rose from 122 for the year 1939 to 333 for 1945. Since then, there have been small rises and falls, the most recent figure available (July, 1949) being 296 .51 Thus, circulation appears to have increased five-fold since before the-war, • and wholesale prices roughly two-and-one-half tines, the relation between money and wholesale prices having however, shown no great change since 1 94-5. The National bank’s Bulletin published in July, 194-8 contains an interesting study of Egypt’s balance of trade for 1945, 194-6, and 194-7, which is summarised as follows, reserves being made as regards the completeness of the figures available: Millions of £E 1945 1946 1147 Sterling Area + 53.3 + 8.4 + 12.2 Non-sterling Area ! 8.8 - 27.6 43.9 + 44.5 - 19.4 31.7 of which known increases ( ♦ ) or decreases (-) of: Sterling balances - + 45.3 - 11.8 35.1 Foreign currencies - + 3.9 Allowing for some capital expenditure resulting in increase of capii assets abroad or.reduction of debt, a net balance is obtained: ' Millions of £E 1945 1946 1947 A, ’Known capital items: Government investments , ' . .i- .• 3.5 3.S 1.0 Redemptions of public debt held abroad . 0.4 ' 0.8 12.3 acquisition of gold for I.M.F.

Balance of payments: + 44.5 - 19.4 31.7 Net balance of payments (A + B) + ¥3.4 - 13.4 18.4The link between Egypt and the sterling area cones out clearly in these figures. Differences between trends in the two cases would be difficult to r illustrate from published material, but are no less remarkable for that, irollo ns and prospects . Egypt*s great problems are maldistribution of wealth, population pressure, and the decline in cotton prices over the last thirty years, it should perhaps be noted, however, that the relation between cotton prices and wholesale prices, or costs of living, as reflected by the official indices, although it has deteriorated since the peak prices reached in 1948, appears to be more favourable now than it was just before the outbreak of World War II. At over 18 million, the country*s population is excessive in relation to existing possibilities of earning a livelihood. As for prospects of increasing these possibilities, it is estimated that the upper limit of cultivation in Egypt . ; .. 5 , ' ~r would be reached if the area were increased by about one-quarter, and that this would cost hundreds of millions of dollars. Even if ample allowance is made for a possible increase of dry farming^ as well as other improvements, and for such industrialisation as the country*s circumstances permit, there remains the limiting factor of the narrowness of’Egypt*s own market, due mainly to maldistribution of wealth. 0 ) In presence of this position, the Egyptian Government has appropriated, since 1946, a total of £E 35.6 H. for a five-year plan consisting of a long list of public works projects. The National Bank Bulletin published in July, 1949 (Vol. II, No.2) in commenting on this plan, states that actual expenditure on it had so far amounted to £E 12,5 M, only out of the £E 35*6 M, appropriated, difficulty having been enccuntored in importing requisite material. Given the rate of spending on the five-year plan and the size of the reserve fund, it does not look as if Egypt*s main trouble lay in meeting the local currency requirements of development projects. If a foreign loan were needed 52 ; P: (1) A valuable study on these problems by Charles Issawi: 'Population and 7/ealth in Egypt' appeared in the Milbank Memorial Fund Quarterly Vol XXVII, No,1 (January, 1949) , *■ to buy equipment abroad prospects would be influenced by Egypt*s ability to produce hard currency for service. This does not seem to.be large, judging by the balance-of-payment, estimates referred to above. The State*s funded debts are not in themselves of a size likely to constitute an obstacle according to the latest figures available at the moment (1943/44)* -Foreign debts, all in sterling, amounted to £E 90 M, , and domestic to £E 93*4 M, Since, then, foreign debt does not appear to have increased. Additions to the domestic debt have taken place; but even if.it were assumed that its. total had doubled since 1943 / 44 , the figure would not be alarming. 5354 ISRAEL The main problem . Israels present population numbers approximately i 1.150.000 soijils, of whom some 150,000 are Arabs and 1,000,000 Jews. About one-third of the latter have entered the country since the end of World War II. On 1st November, 19^-9, there were 90,000 accumulated in immigrant camps. 24.000 newcomers are expected during November .and December, With 41 ,000 leaving the camps during these two months, there should remain a net accumulation of 73,000 on 1st January, 1950. 26,000 new immigrants are expected between 1st January and 1st April of 1950, and 105,000 between 1st April and 1st November, making a total estimated immigration for the first ten months of 1950 of 131,000. When this figure is added to the 73,000 estimated for 1 st January, the total number of immigrants to be absorbed by 1 st November, 1950, amounts to 204,000. Allowing for those who settle themselves and do not go to camps, the net number for whom housing must then be provided would appear to be 165,000. The Minister of Labour and Social Welfare states that 50,000 new housing units will be conpleted by then. In addition, the housing programme demands 12,000 units for earlier immigrants who have been in Israel five years or more and are living in excessively congested quarters. Construction of these 12,000 additional units will release some 3,000 rooms for the use of new immigrants. On the basis of past experience, Israeli officials estimate the per capita cost of immigrant absorption into the economy at $2,500. Although stated in dollars, this figure does not represent the dollar outlay superimposed on the existing balance of payments for each new immigrant. It indicates, in fact, merely the relation of investment to the number of people over an indefinite period. It includes local expenditure for housing ($700), investment in new enterprise for immigrant employment, as well as tools and equipment for labourers and farmers in addition to the immigrants* own contribution, if any, to his resettlement. In fact, of £1 86 million estimated investment for the current year, 45 /^ is being raised locally and 55 /o from abroad.Without the above explanations, this figure of $2,500 per caput might give rise to erroneous conclusions as to hard-currency requirements for the absorption of new immigrants in 1950* However, the financing of immigrant | absorption does confront Israel with a formidable problem. No official estimates were available showing how it is expected to finance this operation, the relative magnitude of which may be measured by what is disclosed of the State*s present expenditure* This falls into three categories: (a) Ordinary budget, balancing at $112 M. (£1 40 M,); (b) Security budget, undisclosed; (c) Development budget, said to amount to roughly $154 M. (£1 55 M.). No figures for the security budget were supplied. However, it was stated that the recent hostilities cost the country 'over £1 100 M.', and that not more than 25 ;i of this expenditure was met out of ordinary- budget receipts. This might mean some £1 75 M, from extra-budgetary sources, including some £1 25 M. stated to have been provided by world Jewry, Military expenditure is said to have ^decreased since the armistice, but to remain a heavy load, even now. Supposing, in order to make a rough guess at Israel s task, that the security budget may amount to about one-half of the ordinary budget, we arrive at an overall budget figure of $322 M., as follows: (a) Ordinary budget $112 M. (b) Security budget (about one-half of $112 M,, as above - a guess) 56 ' •' t * (c) Development budget ^5^f , . • $322 M* Of this total of $322 M., not more than one-third is covered by ordinary receipts at their present rate. It may be that the above guess of £1 56 M. for the security budget is too high. But Israel*s financial position would remain precarious even if the figure were greatly reduced. It is possible that Israel can continue financing its extra-budget security outlay, as at present, by placing Treasury bills with the banks and the public, and by gifts from abroad, without causing disastrous inflation. 5556 There remains the overdl 1 cost of immigrant-absorption including first the $154 M. budgetary outlay earmarked for this purpose, and secondly a sufficient amount of other investment,'domestic and foreign, required to complement government outlay to absorb the iinmigranis, Israel's officials, in forecasting the balance of payments for 1950, estimate that cash requirements for financing imports will amount to 40 million (£1 50 M,), as’compared to ^112 million (£1 40 M.) for the current year, representing a net increase of $28 million (£1 10 M.) # On the receipts side, there is in prospect a falling off of the exchange availabilities of over $20M, The uncovered exchange gap looks like amounting to about 40-55 mi ' 1 lion dollars equivalent in 1950, A detailed examination of this aspect cf the question is appended. As a means of closing the gap, Israel's officials place high hopes upon foreign investment in productive enterprises in the country. So far, however, the results have been disappointing, primarily owing, on the economic side, to a serious discrepancy between the wage line and the official exchange rate. In terms of dollars, Israeli wage rates appear excessively high to the foreign investor, A second possibility of closing the gap would lie in a further compression of domestic consumption, either by more severe taxation or by a higher rate of voluntary savings. While Israeli officials tend to discount the possibilities of additional taxation, they express hope that savings may be further expanded, citing in this connection the Jewish people's habit of saving methodically for investment. Thus, banking officials eBtimote accumulated savings per capita at roughly £1 50 for 700,000 savers. The most important sources from which means of closing the exchange gap might be derived are contributions from world Jewry and releases of sterling balances. Further examination of tiiese crucial aspects of Israel's exchange position is undertaken in the appended study. The preceding comments on the prospective foreign exchange position of Israel assume, mainly for lack of evidence to the contrary, that the existing disruption of trade between Israel and its neighbours will subsist. Obviously, however, a restoration of normal commercial relations would significantly relievethe pressure.upon the Israeli economic position, and also the 2 enera l tutlook for the Arab countries, •Without touching upon any of the political problems involved, further factors to be taken into consideration are:- (1) Israel, with its strict system of control, has so far been forced to forgo the opportunities for international exchange and brokerage business which can be so profitable where transactions are free, and for which many Israelis have the requisite training and aptitude; (2) There is evidence that the £1 is considerably over-valued at the current rate of $2,80, with resultant adverse effects on exports. In an effort to render export pricep more attractive, and to counter inflationary pressure, the Government has launched a deflationary programme which, over a period of six months, has resulted in a decline in the cost of living index from 371 in April to 329 and in wholesale prices from A91 in March to 397, Money wage rates of industrial workers have, been reduced by an average of 1 0ft; and overall wages by 7z/ J ' (3) In appraising these spectacular results, it should be borne in mind that in so rigorously controlled an economy, the significance of a decrease in the Tjrice index is not what it would be in a market economy. Thus an enforced reduction in prices may result in further intensification of the inflationary potential. ( 4 ) There is not full employment in, Israel at present; jobs are rationed like everything else; and immigration is constantly adding to the supply of labour. Production per man-hour is not impressive by Western standards; (5) There is some evidence of latent inflationary pressure. The note circulation has risen from £1 28 M, to £1 48 M. during the past year. The Government has increased the rates of taxo 3 ,.partly for revenue, but partly in order to reduce the pressure of money in circulation on prices. The Government’ greatest asset .in this connection is its people’s firm confidence in the currency;58 (6) Israel has already contracted a $100 M» loan from the Export-Import Bank. Assuming that this total is allocated, service will reach substantial proportions 'within three years, in relation to prospective availabilities. The Government * s programme will require other investments in substantial volume. The question arises whether the country can attract enough capital for its settlement - absorption purposes without contracting to pay more dollar debt service than it can manage. Its chief prospective market for its present main export, citrus fruit, is the U,K, Prospects . A cool examination of the relevant figures (and of the fact that certain crucial data are withheld), is apt to provoke wonderment at the magnitude of the task Israelis Govemmqnt has set itself. But there are forces which cannot be measured in figures, and these forces sometimes decide issues in apparent defiance of reason. Israel has accomplished astonishing things already. It would be as rash to predict that it will not succeed as that it cannot fail. Much depends on the extent of help from abroad. Among the factors working in Israel's favour more potently than in other countries’, the following deserve mention: A relatively large proportion of expenditure goes to education and public health. There is, among many.of the Israelis who have already found a place in the country as well as among newcomers, a high level of education and/or craftmanship. These people can turn to almost any pursuit to which a planned econony will direct them. Next to instruction, public health and welfare are the Govemmentte chief care. In spite of an acute housing shortage and an austerity diet, the people in general look strong and well; .the mortality rate is very low. There is a spirit of national-rapial solidarity, a willingness to make sacrifices in the common interest, a faith in Israels ability to overcome all obstacles, the like of which it would be hard to find elsewhere. In the eyes of its leaders, Israel is running along a one-way road carrying heavy traffic, on which it cannot turn back, or even slow down, v/ithout disaster;59 a road leading to the absorption of* all Jews who, for whatever reason, i.ina life in their present abodes intolerable. The idea that any selection should be made among those wishing to cone is utterly rejected, 'When one*s relatives are faced with misery or destitution, one does not stop to consider whether one can afford to take in all or any of them. One shares what one has with them'. In varying forms, this sentiment is expressed at every turn. There is, however, recognition in some quarters that the rate of influx of immigrants must not be allowed to cause an economic breakdown. Immigrants have reached Israel from almost all over the world. But although the present inflow comes chiefly from Arabia and North Africa, the Israeli way of life has already been set along Western lines, largely by Jews from Central Europe with some experience of and admiration for the U.S.A, There is every prospect that this pattern 1(7111 prevail, and that the immigrants from primitive regions, and especially their children, wi! 1 be absorbed rapidly. Standards of urbanism and public service are high, given the difficulties, and realisation is.improving at a smart rate, Jewry the world over has its eyes fixed on Israel, and will doubtless make great efforts to give it the help it demands. Exchange difficulties are certainly a grave obstacle. About three-quarters of total contributions now come from the dollar area. The USSR and its satellites, ’where the bulk of Jews surviving outside the U.S.A, live, permitted some transfers up to last year. Now, no longer. But it is said that Latin America is a ready giver, and even in the case of the exchange-control countries it is not impossible to work out legal means to enable aid to reach Israel. Finally, it may be that the very magnitude of the task, and of the disaster that would attend failure, are the stimuli needed, at so critical &lt;e a time, to spur on well-wishers abroad to-redouble their efforts, and indeed that the Israeli Government itself regards its chances of survival as better in an atmosphere of peril than it would be if prospects appeared more assured.E. Nor does there seem to be a reasonable possibility of further reducing the standard of living via exchange depreciation, taxation, or forced savings to the degree required to yield significant exchange economies. F. Against this background, the problem of the appropriate rate of release in 1950 of the 25-30 million of frozen sterling balances held by Israel assumes more critical significance than may be generally realized. To a very considerable extent, the prospective gap in the Israeli exchange accounts for 1 950 may be as satisfactorily closed by additional sterling availabilities as by larger dollar receipts. But whether His Majesty*s Government 7/ill find it possible, particularly in view of the repayment demands of its other creditors, to release sterling on the scale required by Israel remains a matter for negotiation between the two governments concerned. 2 0 Historical Dependence of Palestine upon Foreign Aid The central fact in the present economic position and prospects of Israel is that the area now occupied by the Jewish State would probably remain heavily dependent upon a continuing flow of foreign aid for some years to come, even if (a) no further immigration v/ere accepted, and (b) the present obstacles to trade with the Arab world v/ere swept away. Thus, the former Mandate area of Palestine, of which Israel now constitutes an uneconomically isolated segment, was basically a parasite State, largely supported by foreign contributions, by capital inflows induced by political rather than commercial considerations, and by the local expenditures of the British military forces. Even in 1939, less.-than AQA of Palestinian exchange expenditures of about £P 14 million were covered by current earnings on export or service account. The residual of about £P 8,7 million, or more than 60^, was almost entirely supplied by foreign donations, investments, and other capital transfers. IXiring the war and immediate post-war years, moreover, the economy of Palestine became geared to an even more seriously adverse balance on current account. And since the emergence in May, 194$ of the new Israeli State, the r-change-earning capacity of the former Mandate area has still further deteriorated, while exchange requirements have continued to mount.3• Estimated Balance of Payments of Israel in 1 949 The current balance of payments position in Israel, as estimated by the ifs local authorities, may be outlined as follows: t A* Payments requirements _ 1 • Imports With respect to the visible balance of trade, recorded import arrivals in Israel during the first 9 months of 1949 amounted to £1 59#8 millions. Of this total, the Israeli authorities estimate that foodstuffs, raw materials, and other imports for current consumption accounted for 75/*, i.e,,. £1 45.2 millions. The balance of £1 14.6 millions, or 25^-, was comprised of machinery, building material and other capdtal supplies, reflecting the remarkably high rate of capital investment currently in progress.

There mpy \foll exist a rather extensive range of import'requirements for which sterling would provide virtually as effective purchasing power as dollars. With a resumption of normal commercial relation ships with the Arab countries, this range would be further substantially enlarged. Such substitutability, potential as well as actual, of sterling for dollars should be borne in mind 'when considering the prospective exchange requirements of Israel, during 1950 and subsequent years. Of total import arrivals luring the first 9 months of 1949, approximately £1 44 million, or an annual rate' of 51 58.6 million were financed by exchange allocations granted by the Israeli exchange control authorities, although deliveries of capital equipment financed by. the Export-Import Dank did not exceed an estimated £1 800,000 during this period, shipments during the closing months of the year are expected to raise the annual figure to about £1 6 million.The residual £1 15 M. of total in^Dort values, an annual rate of £1 20 M., were provided by connnodity imports requiring no exchange payment. Thus, in addition to donations in kind and the personal belongings brought in by immigrants, the Government has permitted foreign investors to transfer capital' to Israel in the form of commodity imports for resale on local markets. In terms of modes of financing, therefore, the import trade of Israel during the first 9 months of 1949 may be broken down roughly as follows: Category of financing Jan,-Sept, 1949 £1 Millions 1, From the exchange receipts of the Israeli Government 44*0 2, Donations, etc,, in kind 15»0 3, Export-Import Bank loan 0»8 59.8 For purposes of calculating a balance of payments for Israel during 1949, the estimates presented above of import arrivals in the form of donations and Investments in kind and shipments financed by Export-Import Bank-funds, may be utilised v/ithout serious distortion of the current exchange position a of Israel, With respect to these import arrivals financed out of the exchange resources of the Israeli Government, however, one encounters the familiar.' technical problem that import arrivals, so financed, do not reflect the - current rate of exchange commitments but rather commitments made months before. Thus, import arrivals in the early months of 1949 probably correspond tc exchange commitments made in the closing months of 1948, of even earlier. This time lag would not be of serious consequence if the rate of exchange commitments remained unchanged during the period under consideration. But since, in the case of Israel, the rate of exchange commitments has sharply varied during the past eighteen months,, a balance of payments estimate for 1949 cannot rely upon recorded import arrivals without seriously misleading results. Thus, the Israeli authorities report exchange allocations during the first 9 months of 1949, of nearly £1 32 M., or an annual rate of about £1 42,5 M. This conp&gt;ares with actual import arrivals, similarly financed, during the same period, of £1 44 M, (£1 58,6 annually), a strikingly severe cutback ofA £1 16 M, annually, or nearly 30/ &gt; in the rate cf exchange allocations. Since the Israeli Government is reportedly not accumulating reserves, this cutback presumably reflects developing exchange scarcities of grave significance to the Israeli econony. To the extent of perhaps £1 6 M,, this reduction .in exchange allocations will be cushioned by rising deliveries of basic capital imports, financed by the Export-Import Bank loan. The Export-Import Bank loan is providing, in effect, a partial replacement of declining contributions from world Jewry, But since Export-Import Bank funds may not be freely allocated to exchange requirements in general but must instead be reserved for specified projects, the Israeli Government has apparently no alternative but to cut ba.ck imports requiring pay ment in free exchange by about £1 10 M,, representing a net reduction of more than 15/ from the annual rate of import arrivals during the first 9 months of 1 949# Here is a highly significant reflection of the austerity programme which is rendered all the more severe by the continuing growth of the population and resultant compression of the individual share of the national income. To recapitulate, it is estimated that, for balance of payments purposes, the debits on import, account during the calendar year 1949 may be estimated roughly as follows: Estimated Debits on Import Account 1949 Category of Financing Jan.-Sept, Jan,-Dec, £1 millions Exchange Commitments Donations, etc,, in kind Export-Import Bank loan 31.9 15.0 ' 8 42,5 20.0 6,0 68.5 Invisible payments Invisible payments reported by the Israeli authorities amount to £1 8,2 M. for the first 9 months of 1949, suggesting an annual rate of £1 10.9 M, for the entire calendar year. Of this total, freight payments and' remittances reportedly constitute a major fraction. Service payments on previous investments amounted to no more than £1 500,000 during January^September 1949. In 1953, however. Service charges on the Export-Import Bank loan of ^100 M, at 3y: f repayable in 21+ annual instalments, will cause this particular charge upon the balance of payments to rise by approximately $11 M,, or nearly £1 4 M, B. Receipts 1. Exports v On the receipts side, reported exports during the first 9 months of 1949 amounted to no more than £1 8,3 M,, less than 1l+/&gt; of import values 6566 - ™——-w- during the same period. Moreover, nearly 90/? of such export values were concentrated within only three items - citrus fruits, diamonds, and fruit juices - reflecting the exceedingly narrow range of Israeli export availabilities at the present moment. Israeli Exports January - September 1 949 Category of Export Citrus Diamonds Fruit juices Other £1 Millions 5,1 1.4 .8 1.0 8.3 For purposes of balance of payments calculations, however, it is preferable to enploy the slightly lower figure of £1 7.7'M, in actual exchange receipts from exports reported by the Israeli Government. 2. Tourism, etc . With respect to invisible receipts, tourist expenditures, etc., provided approximately £1 5.7 M. during January-September, an annual rate of £1 7.6 M. The exchange assets of arriving immigrants reportedly provided only a negligible share of this total. * * 3. Imports without payment Corresponding to imports without payment running at about £115 M. during January-September, there must, of course, be noted an offsetting credit • • * '. 1 * 11 V ’* ■ on the receipts side. Of this general category of imports financed v/ithout , V ■ actual cash payment, the Israeli authorities have provided - the following breakdown: Imports without Payment January - September 1949 Category Gifts Personal assets of immigrants Transfer of capital Unclassified £1 Millions 1.6 3.7 3.8 _2t2_ 15.0Perhaps the most significant aspects of this breakdown are, first, the comparative impoverishment of the immigrants now flowing into Israel, and, secondly, the failure to attract any substantial volume of commercial investment from abroad, despite the Governmental concessions, noted above, of capital imports in kind for purposes of resale on local markets* Of total capital transfers in kind of £1 M. during January-September, Israeli officials admit that the major proportion is comprised of so-called ’'sentimentalrather than commercial investment. At the present moment, the only purely commercial venture reported to be in reasonable prospect appears to be that of an electrical fixtures plant to be financed by the Philips Company, of the Netherlands, This situation is unlikely to improve so long as Israeli wage rates and productivity remain so far out of line. Thus, at the $2,80 exchange rate, Israeli labour appears exorbitantly expensive to any foreign investor concerned about making money, A, National institutions and funds The most crucial factor in the exchange position cf Israel ? however, is the rate of contribution by world Jewry to the various national institutions and funds, such as the United Jewish Appeal, Here one may note two sharply divergent trends. On the one hand, total contributions by world Jewry for assistance to Jews outside of as well as within Israel evidence an abrupt falling off, Gn~the other hand, with the transfer of refugee Jews in Europe to Israel, the percentage share of Israel in the total of Jewish contributions is rising. On-balance, however, the trend of donations actually received by Israel, as distinct from allocation of Jewish relief funds to other areas, appears to be sharply downward. Thus, donations to Israel during the 11 months* period October 1 %8 to August 1%9, amounted to ,£I 36.4 M,, an annual rate of roughly £1 40 M. In striking contrast, donations during Januaiy-September 1949 amount to only somewhat more than £1 20 M,, an annual rate of approximately £1 27 M, This sharp decline in the rate of contributions constitutes a most serious threat to the economic stability cf the Jewish State,5• Release of sterling balances 68' • Finally, a significant share of Israeli imports during 1949 is 'being financed by releases of sterling balances granted by the United Kingdom, Thus for the 10 months’ period Januory^-October, the U.K* has released sterling in the equivalent of about £1 8 M,, of which'£1 6 # 5 M, were spent or committed during the first 9 months cf the year. Residual sterling balances of Israel are variously estimated between £1 29 and 30 M, Negotiations regarding future releases of these blocked balances are reportedly soon to be initiated. In this connection, it may be noted that as at Uth November, 1949, the Issue Department of the Anglo-Palestine Bank of Israel recorded nearly £1 24 M, of such sterling assets as backing of the note issue. The Israeli authorities* clearly intend, however, to substitute domestic obligations as fully as possible for such idle exchange assets, in the convictipn; that popular confidence in the currency is so^strong as to require relatively little psychological support in the form of gold or other exchange reserve backing for the currency, ■ ■' To recapitulate, the foregoing rough estimate of the major balance of payment items may be summarised in tabular form as fallows Estimated Balance of Payments of Israel for 1949 £1 Ml lions Payment s i , Jan, —Sept , Imports: (a) Exchange Commitments (b) Donations, etc,, in kind (g) Export-Import Bank: 31.9 15.0 42.0 20.0 actual shipments 0.8 6,0 Invisibles Total 47t7 8,2 55.9 68,0 10.9 78.9 Receipts : Exports Tourism, etc. Donations etc,, in kind National Institutions &amp; Funds Release of Sterling Balances Export—Import Bank loan 7.7 5.7 15.0 20.2 6.5 .8 10.3 7.6 20.0 27.0 8.0 6,0 Total 55.9 78.969 Of total payments requirements currently approximating £1 79M. annually, receipts from exports, tourism, and various services thus cover no more than £1 18 M., or roughly 23 per cent 0 ,The residual balance of more than £1 61 M., or 77a, only precariously financed by foreign contributions and other capital inflow's. In terns of the national income, such capital transfers probably account for more than 25 /b of the total flow of goods and services 1 currently available..to Israel, \ Balance of payments prospects for 1950 ^n.d 193^ Unfortunately, there is little if any prospect of an early improvement in this dangerously unbalanced exchange position. Even in the absence of. further immigration, it is doubtful that any significant economies could be effected in the consumers’ goods import programme, which has been already compressed to severely austere proportions, Cn the contrary, “nternal political pressures may well force a relaxation cf the present austerity programme with consequent heavier demands upon the exchange resources of Israel, While additional conaumption imports might be financed by cutting back the investment programme, such action would, of courso, only delay . still further the ultimate achievement of economic viability,. But by far the mopt dangerous element in .the balance of payments outlook of Israel is the continuing inflow of immigrants. In many Jewish quarters there apparently exists an absolute conviction that Israel can absorb no less than 1 million further immigrants, thereby doubling its present population, within the brief space of four years. But in recent months, the present government has apparently concluded that immigration during 1 950 and 1951 cannot safely exceed more than _ 150*000 annually. In view of the severe political pressures upon these officials to permit an unrestricted influx, however, • the figure of 150,000 immigrants annually may well prove a relatively optimistic forecast df the burden of additional population to be suddenly thrust upon an economy already strained to the utmost.With respect to the prospective cost of immigrant absorption, Israeli officials repeatedly cite an estimate of ^ 2,500 per capita, allegedly based upon the cost experience of earlier years, c • If by absorption, the Israeli Government means that immigrants when fully ’’absorbed' should contribute to exchange earnings, directly or indirectly, as much as they increase import requirements, or ** more precisely - that the entire economy, including the new population, should earn as much exchange as it spends, the capital investment required to render the new immigrants self- supporting in this sense would probably far exceed the $ 2,500 estimate. Thus, as noted above, even the existing population of about 1 million is currently earning no more than 23 /c of its current exchange outlay. But even if the $2,500 estimate is accepted, one immediately encounters the further difficulty that no breakdown of this figure between foreign exchange and local currency costs is available. There is here involved, of course, the delicate issue of the value of Arab property expropriated by Israel. Moreover, Israeli officials are reluctant to provide even a rough estimate of the time period over which such immigrant cost outlays must be effected. While it would seem obvious that, given an influx of say, 150,000 immigrants in 1950, the Israeli Government could not possibly spend at a rate of $2,500 per immigrant in a single year, even if it possessed the cash required, there is nevertheless no basis for choosing between the relatively more reasonable time periods of 3, 5, 10 or even 15 years required for full absorption. And it is obvious that as the time period lengthens, the entire absorption. \ operation becomes progressively less economic, i.e., the carrying cost of providing for the current exchange requirements of the immigrants vri.ll constitute an increasing share of the entire absorption cost. Thus, if the average absorption period should prove to be, say, ten years, the exchange requirements of the immigrants for purely consumption purposes might approach or even exceed the cost of machinery and other capital imports required to ensure their ultimate self-sufficiency.In general, it would seem probable that the Israeli officials have been unable to make, even for their own confidential purposes, any reasonably useful estimates of the overall absolution cost and of its distribution over time. It is accordingly suggested that the ^2,500 estimate be disregarded entirely and attention focused instead upon the more limited but somewhat less helpless task of estimating the prospective cost of providing the 150,000 immigrants with reasonably adequate housing. State services, and more or less productive employment. On this basis, the Israeli Ministry of Finance estimates that import * ' ' ' ■ • requirements in 1950, exclusive of deliveries financed by the Export-Import Bank loan and donations in kind, will be increased by roughly £110 M. in the event of 150,000 immigrant arrivals. This estimate inqfLies an increase of roughly 24 &gt;. in cash-financed imports, primarily of consumers f goods, as compared with a population increase of 15^, and a probably lesser percentage increase in the gross national product available for consumption. Pending further investigation, the £110 M, estimate would appear to be a reasonable approximation. Whatever additional capital requirements may be occasioned by the annual 150,000 immigrants should be more than taken care of by Export-Import Bank * financing already provided. As a very rough guess, the Israelis might succeed in putting to use in 1 950 as much as $35 - A0 M. of capital equipment so financed, leaving a residual of $45 - 50 M. available for 1951 - 52, Invisible outlays during 1950 should not markedly increase, if at all, nor is there in firm prospect any significant rise in invisible receipts. Under favourable harvesting and marketing conditions, export yields from citrus and other shipments might expand export earnings during 1 950 to, say, £1 13 M., roughly 30/: above the current rate. But the crucial item on the receipts side, is, of course, the donations from the National Institutions and Funds to be expected. As noted above, Israel is currently faced with an ominous decline in the rate of donations from the National Institutions and Funds, In seeking to forecast the balance of paymentsposition of Israel in 1950, therefore, an assumption that 1950 donations will not decline further below the 1 949 annual rate would probably tend to err on the side of optimism rather than pessimism. On the basis of the assunptions outlined above, the Israeli Government would be faced in 1950 with exchange requirements for essential imports of roughly £1 52 M,, and for services of about £1 11 M,, or a total of £1 63 M,, against exchange availabilities that will probably fail to exceed £1 48 M, This would suggest a minimum exchange gap of about £1 15 M,, or somewhat more than ^40 M, In view, however, of the relatively optimistic assumptions made v/ith respect to the rate of immigration and the contributions of world Jewry, the deficit to be actually incurred in 1950 may very well approach £1 18 - 20 M or about 50 - 55 M. dollars equivalent. It is of considerable significance that this prospective daficit in 1950 is not necessarily a dollar gap, as distinct from shortages of other currencies As noted in an earlier connection, extensive possibilities unquestionably exist for diverting purchases hitherto made in hard-currency markets to the sterling and other soft-currency areas. Thus, it is entirely possible that most of the gap now in prospect might be clused by additional sterling becoming available to Israel, When and if consideration may be given to extraordinary means of financing this prospective deficit in Israeli exchange accounts in 1950, therefore, the problem of the appropriate rate of release of the £1 25 - 28 M, in frozen sterling balances currently held by Israel will unquestionably become of crucial significance.■ WV'' o\\ h (THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT) SECRET M.E,(0)( F )0) 1st Meeting ^OPY NO.

Du Merton CONTENTS : Item Subject Page 1 WASHINGTON DISCUSSIONS ON ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE MIDDLE EAST 1 2. UTILISATION 01' SURPLUS OIL REVENUES IN THE PERSIAN GULF 31 WASHINGTON DISCUSSIONS ON ECONOMIC AND SOCI AL DEVELOPMENTS IN THE MIDDLE EAST The Committee considered a note by the Joint Secretaries (M.E* (0) (I 49 ) 36 ) covering a record of discussions in Washington with the State Department and the International Bank:. THE CHAIRMAN said that the discussions on the Middle East with the State Department which he and Mr. Evans had undertaken in November had served a useful purpose in clarifying our common objectives and in removing any idea that there might be rivalry between the United States and ourselves in the Middle East affairs. Although the United Kingdom had by tradition the main influence in the area (a fact which was fully recognised by the United States), American co-operation in the Middle East was essential to ensure even the minimum progress that was considered necessary. The United States contribution in the form of military aid to the 'Near East', i.e. Greece, Turkey and Persia, v/as already substantial. The State Department had expressed full agreement with the United Kingdom proposals embodied in the Committee^ report on economic and social development, and were prepared to consider means of contributing towards such development. They had also approved the interim report of the Economic Survey Mission. On the question of United States f in^.ncial aid, the States Department were of the opinion that-direct contributions by Congress would probably be confined to*.- (i) Funds for refugee resettlement, and (ii) Funds for technical assistance under Point A, which would constitute a special contribution for the Middle East over and above that provided through the United Nations. They were thinking in terms of a total annual appropriation of 012 million for the 'Near East', of which about 05 million mightybe expendable in the Arab States of the Middle East. The Committee then gave consideration to the question of technical assistance to the Middle East and in the course of discussion the following points arose:- (a) The State Department had calculated that the proposed 05 million dollars which they would probably have to spend on salaries of United States specialists would cover the annual payment of roughly 200 experts. No precise estimate of the number likely to be required in practice for employment in the Middle East was available, though the Committee were informed that it was unlikely that more than 30 specialists would be required for all the four pilot projects proposed by the Economic Survey Mission. Moreover, the employment of experts in the Middle East was conditional on the confidence and support of the local governments. In some cases there were already fully qualified native experts, and the requirements would vary immensely from country to country. On the whole it seemed to the Committee unlikely that as many as 200 new specialists would be employable during the first year. (b) The State Department thought that apart from salaries some provision might also be made from technical assistance funds for the technical and scientific equipment which the experts would require for their work. The Committee welcomed this possibility but were of the opinion that^at least in the first years the need .of many Middle East countrieswould lie very Irrgely in the field of education r.nd of vocrtionrl trrining, e.g. the provision of instructors r.nd trrining equipment r.nd the possible endowment of technicr.l schools*. (c) The United States had now agreed to set up an institute for Near Eastern .Affairs under the supervision of the State Department to organise technical aid to the Middle Erst. We had welcomed this step in preference to their establishing an office parallel to the British Middle East- Office or Jointly with it. Co-ordination of British and American efforts called for careful consideration* In view of the advisability offurther talks with the State Department on technical aid before Congress came to consider the Fourth Point for appropriation, it was agreed that material should be prepared by the Working Party on the purposes to which, in our view, technical assistance funds should be devoted, including technical (including agricultural) training, equipment, etc., as proposed- under (b) above. Our object would be to persuade the State Department to take what action it could to influence C-ongress to extend the scope of their contribution beyond the mere payment of salaries. It was suggested that the State Department might be informed in advance of any further talks, that in our view/ arrangements made should not exclude the use of the funds in this way. Advice on training schemes could be sought by the Working Party from the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, who had much experience in such matters. As the State Department had considered that Cyrenaica and Tripoli should not necessarily be ruled out of consideration, their requirements should also be included in the notes. It was also agreed that further consideration would have to be given to the form of liaison which should be established betv/een His Majesty r s G-overnment and the Institute for Near Eastern Affairs in Washington, and v/hether this liaison could be maintained by existing Embassy staff or needed the attachment of an ad hoc official* The question of United States liaison (possibly through a member of the United States Embassy in Cairo) v/ith the British Middle East office was also considered, v The Committee:- s v, (1) Invited the Working Party, in consultation with the Deputy Chairman of the Economic Survey Mission, to prepare for consideration by the Committee notes on the purposes to which technical assistance V funds should be devoted, as a. basis for discussion with the State Department. (2) Invited the Working Party to consider the nature of the United Kingdom liaison to be established in Washington with the Institute for Near Eastern Affairs. MR. EVANS said that the International Bank had shown great interest both in the Middle East as an area and in the projects listed in the Interim Report, and agreed that the development projects proposed were of a type vdiich merited serious consideration. As regards the Bank T s participation, it was indicated that the dollar requirements of the projects under consideration were comparatively small; on the other hand, their ability to assist in financing the sterling element would depend on the extent to which the United Kingdom would be prepared to make its 1 Sfo capital contribution available for the purpose, or to allow loans to be floated in the London market. - 2 --3~ In discussion it wcs pointed out that drawing on the 18% contribution v/ould have the same effect relative to the United Kingdom balance of payments as further sterling releases or th*c floating of loans in London. Though the Treasury agreed as to the desirability of United Kingdom^ participating in development loans, we could not act against the fundamental policy laid down. The Chancellor of the Exchequer had already refused to use the 18% contribution to assist Iraq. It was also pointed out that Ministerial approval of the Interim Report on Economic and Social Development in the Middle- Erst, was on the assumption that the United Kingdom could only contribute within the limits of her economic and financial capacity. It was not at present clear to what extent financial assistance would be likely to be forthcoming from the United Kingdom st least for some years. It was agreed, that the discussion on the subject should be resumed at a further meeting, and that meanwhile the Secretariat should prepare a list of instances in which it was likely that requests for sterling loans were likely to arise in the next year or two. The Secretariat should also prepare a list showing the amounts of free sterling (e.g. Egyptian Account No. 1) available to Middle East Governments. The Committee were informed that sections of the Pinal Report of the Economic Survey Mission, which would be circulated to them in the course of a few days, cobtained a. financial appendix which was of considerable interest in the study of financial resources available to the Middle East. The Committee:- (3) Invited the Secretariat to prepare notes on the possible requests for sterling assistance from Middle East countries on the lines agreed in discussion, and a list showing amounts of free sterling available to Middle Erst Governments. 2, UTILISATION OP SURPLUS OIL REVENUES IN THE PERSIAN GULF The Committee had before them a Note by the Joint Secretaries (M.E.(0) (U9)35) covering a report by the Working Paety on the Persian Gulf States. MR. EVANS said that the Working Party recommended in the report (section IV) that we should encourage the Rulers of the States to conserve surplus oil revenues pending the completion of domestic development plans; and that means should be found of investing and utilising any such funds not required internally for development elsewhere in the Middle East. The Working Party would be glad of guidance on the following suggestions which had been received ‘for elaboration in a paper which they now had in hand:- (±) Investment in the Inte rnational Bank The Bank v/ere themselves interested in this suggestion and the Committee recommended that it should be pursued. fii) Investment in British s e curities Such investment might be arranged so that corresponding amounts of British capital should be provided for the Middle East. Little progress was possible in the immediate future.(iil) Investment in r. Middle Ecst Development Corporation Committee- considered thet in generel the Middle East Ste.tes would be unwilling to lend directly or indirectly to other Middle Erst Governments. Investment in such a Corporation by the Overseas Food Corporation, as was suggested, was unlikely owing to their present commitments; the Colonial Development Corporation was constitutionally precluded from participating except possibly in respect of /.den and Oman. The possibility of the Sheikh of Quwo.it investing in the development of agricultural areas in return for the produce being made available for export to Quwait was also suggested. The Committee:- Took^note of M.E.(0)(49)35 and of the points made in discussion.

ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE MIDDLE EAST FINAL REPORT OF THE UNITED NATIONS ECONOMIC SURVEY MISSION FOR THE MIDDLE EAST. Note ~by Joint Secretaries (previous Reference: M.E.(0)(50) 1.) Chapter III (Pilot Demonstration projects) is circulated herewith* (Signed) M.M. DU MERTON T.E. EVANS CABINET OFFICE, S.W.l 3rd January, 1950(vi)/ CHAPTER III PILOT DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS Prom the projects included in the plans of the individual countries considered hy the experts of the Mission, four have 'been selected as H pilot demonstra tion” projects, one each in Jordan, Arab Palestine, Lebanon and Syria* The Economic Survey Mission hao chosen these by appraising their characteristics in the light of the following criteria: (i) They are high on the list of projects which the government of the country concerned would like to undertake# (ii) They are of a size and cost which is either limited by the very nature of the project itself or which can bo limited without doing violence to possible future expansion of the project. (iii) They are capable of completion within a few years and will exemplify in a practical man ner, and in; a relatively short time, the steps required to turn ideas into action. (iv) They are varied in their nature and require in handling some interesting differences in technique• (v) They will demonstrate technical team-work on a small but important scale./ (Vi) •• Thoy will give the governments of the countries concerned experience in planning and execution* (vii) They will employ labour and lead to the per-^ manent employment of other labour when completed, through tho settlement in newly opened areas of families engaging in agri cultural pursuits. (viii) They can be included among, or become the logical extensions of, the short-term pro grammes of relief works recommended by the Economic Survey Mission in its Interim Report. (ix) They can lay the basis for more important and larger development schemes. The Economic Survey Mission also considers that these selected pilot projects, in addition to contribu ting towards the development of the countries in which they are located, v/ould bo specially educative in nature and give experience in overall planning to the,’govern ments, officials and technicians of Middle Eastern countries. With the co-operation of the governments concerned, these pilot projects can serve to instruct not only Middle Eastern governments and their officials engaged on the work, but others whom the governments might select to observe and learn, and so build up a skilled cadre of technicians among their own peoples. Though/Though no oaoential feature of the scheme, it would certainly hell) future development in the Middle East were governments of countries wherein pilot pro jects are carried out to allow officials, technical men and students from other Middle Eastern countries to visit the works, to observe and learn from the technique employed. After due consideration, the Economic Survey Mission has not felt itself able to recommend the initiation of a “pilot demonstration” project in Egypt. The knowledge and skill available in-that country are already on a high level. Moreover, no development scheme possessing the special characteristics set out above is in view* Egypt indeed has a problem of unemployment among her agricultural population at least as great as that of an 7 Middle Eastern country; but Egypt is‘in fair measure able to tackle this problem for herself, and already has plans to do so. Nor does the Economic Survey Mission recommend a “pilot demonstr?tion“ project in Israel-held territory. The reasons which have led the Mission to this decision are very similar to those relating to Egypt. Israel already has available technical men of all kinds and of the highest skill, knowledge and experience in modern scientific methods. Moreover, the Israeli Government has already begun, on its own initiative, with the r datively large funds placed at its disposal from abroad, to develop irrigation and to employ modern agri- cultural methods in an- endeavour to find employment for the/V tno continuing stream of immigrants. In addition, Israel possesses in the Weizmann Institute and other research stations and laboratories, a means of enquiry, ^ education and progress which is not only superior to anything available in the neighbouring Arab States, but may compare favourably with similar institutions throughout the world, Iraq, with a standard of life and economic problems corresponding to those of other Arab countries in the Middle East, undoubtedly forms part of that area with which this report is concerned. However, the Economic Survey Mission is informed that on the initiative of its own Qovemment, Iraq is in negotiation with the Inter national r.ank for a loan wherewith to finance the comple tion of two schemes for flood control on the Euphrates and Tigris respectively. One of these two projects — that connected with the Euphrates and known as the Haobaniyeh project - is already under way. Lack of funds prevents its completion. Work on the Wadi Tharthar to control the Tigris floods is not begun. Until the out come of negotiations between the Iraqi Government and the International Bank is known, the Economic Survey Mission feels anable to recommend the construction of a 'pilot demonstration' project in Iraq. Should the governments of Egypt, Iraq or Israel request the help or advice of the international community or friendly Member Governments in the prosecution of their plans, there is every reason to believe that technical assistance could be made available.mm A brief description of suggested pilot demonstra tion projects follows. A more complete discussion of each project, together with preliminary estimates, is contained in Appendix V. JORDAN The Wadu Zerqi Project . • The Jordan Valley is by far the greatest land asset in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan for development under irrigation farming. At present only a small proportion of the land there is intensively cropped or irrigated# For some years the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan has considered the possibility of developing the Eastern Jordan Valley by use of the combined waters of the Rivers Jordan and YarmuK and the several wadis which lie wholy within Jordan. Surveys to determine these possibili ties have already been carried out, but lack of funds and the need for agreement on the share of water which will- fall to Jordan will almost certainly defer extensive development of the Jordan River as a complete system. There ore no such difficulties, however, with the waters of the wadis rising in Jordan. They belong to Jordan alone. Should the major irrigation scheme from the Jordan and Y 0 rmuk Rivers prove to be feasible later. work/work done previously on the wadis will not he wasted. The waters of the wadis on both sides of the Jordan River will still he required to the maximum extent to which they can be developed. Pull development of the wadis demands storage of the winter floods, much of which now pour unchecked and wasted, laden v/ith silt, into the Jordan River. The Ixi sin of the Wadi Zerqa is the largest of those drained by the Jordan wadis. Small areas on the Zerqa valley floor and in the Jordan Valley are at pre sent irrigated, but the amount of land under irrigation is limited by the minimum flow of the stream which can bo counted upon in the dry season of the year. The rest of the water is now wasted. It is proposed that this watershed area be developed completely and as a unit. Roads would be constructed to make the area easily accessible; a dam of rock and earth, about -, 35 metres high, would be built across the wadi to control the floods in the rainy season and to save some of the surplus water for release in the summer thereby doubling the land to be irrigated; small check dams on principal gullies in the upper watershed would be built to reduce silting; forest trees would be planted in the rim above the reservoir; terraces on the hillsides and fruit trees would be established where this proves to be feasible. Construction of a central vil lage would be included as part of the development in order to provide adequate housing facilities for construction/construction workers and., in the future, to s atisfy, in part, the permanent housing requirements of the area. Where the wadi enters ..the Jordan plain an addi tional 'headworks'- wo.uld be built to lead the water into the irrigation canals which would allocate the water to the various users on the land. With more water-available, changes in the present cereal agriculture of the Jordan Valley would be pos sible, thereby providing an unusual opportunity to test and demonstrate a fundamental reform in the- use of land and water in the area. . , Because the Jordon Valley lies some hundreds of feet below sea level, its crops ripen'for the market earlier in the season than in the plateaux-above •the valley, and thus would command premium prices. A change from cereals production ;to intensive cultivation of more profitable crops, such as sugarcane and cotton, with ■' accompanying industrial possibilities, or vegetables, fruits, and possibly forage crops if dairying should prove profitable, would (Comprise a new and more profi table system .of agriculture and be a great boon to Jordan and the whole area. Research and experiment carried bn concurrently with the physical developments will, show the way to these important results and will constitute an outstanding part of the whole demonstration. Thus the Wadi Zerqa project can be 'of great impor tance to the future of Jordan and, by demonstration and imitation/imitation, to the whole area. Irrigation, flood con trol, engineering and construction, crop experiments in new systems of agriculture, including afforestation and the several aspects of soil and water conservation and land use, combined in one project, would provide an unusual opportunity for a new experience for the people; and a chance for the Government of Jordan to gain know ledge and confidence in the future development of the country’s idle resources. ,jbvB Palestine The Wadi Qilt Project. In the hills north-east of Jerusalem a deep, narrow gorge reaches into the Jordan Plain near Jericho. This is the Wadi Qilt in tho central part of ^rab Palestine. As in the Wadi Zerqa, the surplus water runs in wasted flood in the rainy season and land otherwise useful is denied sufficient water for the rest of the year. Here again, construction of a dam will permit efficient use of the water, and this in turn will increase the useful ness of land now idle. This development, like the Wadi Zerqa demonstration, can start as a works project, employ refugees and give them an opportunity to settle on the State-owned lands their work enriches. But the Wadi Qilt has important value as a demonstration project for other reasons. Some / of£ the experience gained 'by the research required to meet the agricultural problems of the Wadi Zerqa can be applied to the planning of the Wadi Qilt and vice versa, thus demonstrating how forethought and careful planning can savo expense in overheads, make one pound serve to do the work of two; while the results achieved in a relatively short time, patent for all to see and appraise, will stimulate similar action on the other wadis - not a few in the Jordan Valley, both east and west .of the river - and so bring work and prosperity within the grasp of many. LEBANON The Litani River Investigation Project In many respects the Litani River is the key to the economic future of Lebanon, It has great possi bilities as a source of low—cost electric power useful to urban and rural life, to pump water for irrigation, to process.and conserve the seasonal surplus of fruits and vegetables and to encourage the growth of industry. The Lebanon mountains give to this important river an annual average rainfall of some 27 inches — an advantage enjoyed by few areas in this part of the world. The mountain valley, through which the Litani flows as it loaves the fertile Beqaa Plain in central Lebanon, •drops the river more than 2,500 feet to the sea in the /shortshort distance of some 80 miles. To an engineer this means power - power from falling water - captured by dams to regulate and stabilise the flow of the river, to release it through turbines on its way to the sea. The engineering experts.of the Mission ^timate that a series of storage dams on the-lAtani could develop as much as 200 # 000 kilowatts of power, capable of producing 750 million kilowatt hours of electricity each year. In addition, these storage dams, would increase the water supply for irrigation far above even the maximum needs of the irrigable land along the coast from Tyr to Sidon. But before any chins are built on the Litani a com plete investigation of the whole river and its drainage area should be made. The Litani is too precious an asset to be developed in piece-meal, unplanned fashion. Its full development will require a relatively large capital expenditure. If properly studied and planned the Litani can be developed step by step and thus set the pace for an intensive economic growth of the Lebanon, accompanied by substantial financial and social benefits. It is proposed that the task of making a complete study and technical investigation of this river and its watershed be undertaken as a pilot demonstration project. A more complete description of the scope of the proposed field investigation is presented in Appendix V. The Middle East needs a first-hand demonstration of how to plan a river’s development and use as a whole.ho experience of the Middle East countries has for the most part been limited thus far to general descrip tive surveys, inadequate to determine the economic or engineering feasibility of river developments, or else to investigations of a part of a river seeking a fair site for a single project unrelated to any others that might later be built. Countries learning to think about the development of their rivers need to understand and experience the necessity of combining adequate pre liminary engineering, geologic, economic, agricultural and financial studies and investigations as a part of the process of wise planning. Here is an opportunity to demonstrate the value of technical assistance, the need for competent engineers and experts. Here is an opportunity to teach the process of making plans for immediate action and proceeding step by step toward actual development. The prosecution of this investigation and study would provide an opportunity for training and experience for local engineers and technicians, under the guidance of experienced experts from outside. A demonstration of the modern way to plan a river system will furnish a valuable example to other Middle Eastern countries as they become practically interested in the ‘development of their rivers. The completed investigations would make it possible for Lebanon to decide how to proceed - where to buildaaras, how to finance them and how to realise the great 'benefits latent in its priceless asset - the Litani river. SYRIA The Ghab Valley Project In prehistoric time a volcanic flow filled up the channel of the Orontes River below Karkour and fomed a great lake in north-west Syria, near what is now the Turkish border, . Then, with the passing of time, silt from the Orontes and from the adjacent mountains filled the lake, forcing the river to drive a' new channel to the Mediterranean. The now course of the river carried the waters slowly through groat, flat, fertile plains, which eventually became a swamp. This is the Ghab Valley. Through the years a number of comprehensive studies have been made of this area by'French engineers and others. Each plan has proposed a scheme for drainage, a dam for flood control and canals for irrigation. The flood control dam might also produce electric power. The fertile plain would thus bo restored for use and habita tion, and a rain-fed area and its river would be added to the productive economy of Syria and the Middle East. The construction of roads to connect the new land with the populous cities nearby,' and the creation of a central village would also be included as part of the development.• V T’Lis pilot demonstration project would thus con sist of a complete eigneering-agricultural'and economic plan for the development of the valley as a whole. The problems of drainage, highways, housing, malaria control, public health, village organisation, flood control, irrigation, hydro-electric power, and . agriculture would combine in a single project a veri table small-scale model of the problem of Syria as a whole# This pilot project would provide a rare opportunity to Revise practical plans and test them in actual experience. Through such a unified development programme the potentially fertile G-hab Valley would be transformed from an unproductive swampy area into one of the roost productive areas in Syria, Perhaps the much planned . ' and discussed development of the more remote areas of the Khabur River and the savannahs of the Jezira would appear more feasible than at present, if experience could be gained first in the development of the Ghab, These are the most important unsettled areas of the great spaces of Syria - future, profitable living space for Syria’s people. Those, then, are the pilot demonstration projects which, in the opinion of the Economic Survey Mission, could'begin the long and complex process of basic resource development in the countries of Lebanon, Jordan and Arab / Palestinet Palestine and Syria, These projects could command the interest of local people, once the work v/as started# The meaning of potential resources' would he demon strated by the work of their own hands. The expert* once and pride which come from successful execution of work could stimulate enthusiasm for next steps, other projects. Pilot projects, skilfully spot-lighted by the national government, could be the. beginning of the dynamic process which brings hundreds and finally thousands of small reforms and changes of benefit to peoples and their governments. The cumulative educa tional effect of the many small facets in a single unified development project would influence social, economic and administrative practices in neighbouring lands. Local educators and teachers, observing and studying the demonostration, could relate the occupa tional requirements of the work to the educational, programmes of their schools. They could play a part in exploiting the training possibilities inherent in the construction of the dams, the reclamation and development of new land. The experience of other countries has shown that the power of example and demonstration as an aid to progress cannot be denied. If properly •arried out and interpreted, these demonstrations can help to build democratic opportunity for emulation and initiative / reaching L rAgriculture, anci the Minister for Foreign Affairs, These Development Boards would not only serve to ensure continuity, but also to focus liaison and ne gotiation between, the government of the country, on the one hand, and, on the other, any external body, advisory or executive, international or otherwise, through which technical or financial assistance might be made available or requested. It might well be desirable to provide for the co option on to the Board - as a temporary measure and from time to time - of other authorities. For example, at certain stages, the Ministers responsible for National Health, Education and Social Welfare, who would certainly have to be consulted, might usefully be represented. Nevertheless, it would be advisable to adhere to the principle that an unwieldy committee tends rather to slow down progress than speed up action. The object to be attained would be thoroughness and competence in tech nical planning and speed in decision and administration, combined with an assurance that the best interests of the nation, - as seen by the government, were being duly served. The national Development Boards envisaged above would be appropriate bodies to co-ordinate all plans and action relating to the development of a country’s re sources, in accordance with the terms of reference given to it by the government of that country. It is there fore assumed that a Development Board would concern / itself.itself, not only with development by cultivation of the .and through irrigation works and the application of other forms of modem engineering and agricultural science, but also with the development of housing, of communications by road and rail, and, yet further, with the development of industry where need and opportunity were found to exist. It might also usefully handle certain questions relating to public health, education and social services. It therefore seems inevitable, and is certainly desirable, that a national Development Board should be set up as soon as possible in each Arab State tempora rily harbouring refugees from Palestine, where a pro gramme of relief works giving temporary employment to those refugees is to be started. 'But, since funds for financing relief works will come largely from the United Nations, through the Relief and Wofks Agency for Palestine Refugees, established by A Resolution of the General Assembly, it follows that the Development Boards should be the agents of govern ment for contact and negotiation with that body. This last-named Agency, being the United Nations trustee for the expenditure of United Nations funds, whether on direct relief for Palestine refugees or for relief works, will be bound to act on the basis of an Agreement drawn uo between itself and each Midale Eastern / governmentgovernment concerned* These Agreements, while similar in principle, may differ in detail according to circum stance. The negotiation of such agreements with The United Nations Relief and Works agency for Palestine Refugees would he among the first tasks of a national Development Board. Similarly, the choice and prosecution of a pilot demonstration project, its detailed planning and defini tion, provision for its execution, the co-ordination of the various types of technical assistance required and used on the project would he determined under the auspices of the Development Board. Assurance that pilot demonstration projects provide training and experience for the younger technical per sonnel locally available, leadership in relating educa tional systems to the training of additional people, interpretation of the purpose, progress and results of the projects to the national leaders and the public - all are necessary functions appropriate to the national Develo- mont Board sponsoring the project within its country. Some of the governments of the Middle Eastern coun tries, recognising the importance and need thereof, have already established or are in process of establishing a Development Board. They will thus be in a better posi tion to proceed quickly with their part of the work relief programme for Palestine refugees. / MoreoverMoreover, it is probable that those ftovermuents who have set up a Development Board will find greater and more effective opportunities to draw upon technical assistance from the United Nations, the United Nations Specialized Agencies and individual Member Governments ready to provide technical and financial assistance when specifically requested. A 'further task of the highest importance devolving upon the national Development Boards would be the institution and prosecution of research - in agriculture, engineering and any activity contributing to the more profitable development of the countries' national resources. Research is a continuous process which can only be carried out through research establishments and by experiment involving the employment of trained scientists and technicians and the use of apparatus and material which at present can only be made available to Arab States from abroad. While not demanding an outlay comparable to that required for the actual construction of a great development project, research costs money for land, buildings, scientific apparatus, experiments and the highly paid services of highly skilled men. The conduct of research is a matter for but a few people. Research will not of itself employ refugees from Palestine, however much it may contribute indirectly to their eventual successful rehabilitation. Therefore but little of the cost of research, if any, can legitimately be charged against /UnitedUnited Nations funds earmarked for the direct relief of^ Palestine refugees, or even for works projects designed to give those refugees employment. Part of the essential expenditure should properly fall upon the governments for whose 'benefit and under whose jurisdiction research is carried on. Certain of the governments should 'be alle to find some money for this purpose from their own internal resources. The cost of providing land and 'buildings, and the wages of unskilled or semi-skilled labour should be borne, save in exceptional circumstances, by the government* On the other hand, the cost of apparatus, scientific 1 nstru™^ and other similar needs, together with the salaries of foreign expertsbe byond the immediate means of certain interested governments to provide, in riew.of .the h many other claims upon the exiguous funds at their disposal. Yet the need for modern research on Middle Eastern technical problems is urgent* This has long been recog nized by all governments concerned^ It is the more urgent if the best value is to be obtained, even from things as they are or from schemes proposed as work relief projc^t^ for Palestine refugees; still more so if pilot demonstra tion projects are to be undertaken, as recommended by the Economic Survey Mission in this Report, or if governments find other means for themselves of beginning work on different projects for the development of their own countries. The urgency of this problem has persuaded the Economic Survey Mission that special funds for research should be / mademade available at orice from external sources. The United Nations disposes at present of* no fund expendable for this purpose. The Mission therefore appeals to the governments of the countries. Members of the United Nations, charged by the General Assembly in its Resolution of 8 December 1949 with appointing their representatives to constitute and serve upon the Advisory Commission for The Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees, jointly to make available to the Advisory Commission a sum not exceeding 010 million in all, this fund to remain available until expended by the Advisory Commission for the promotion of research activity in those Middle Eastern countries where, in the opinion of the Advisory Commission, it is most needed. This capital fund would be made available as grants, reimbursable or otherwise, as might be determined by the Advisory Commission, upon application made by a Middle Eastern government and upon terms to be negotiated between the Advisory Commission and the government concerned. In addition to serving as an aid to the founding of research establishments and experimental work, this fund could also be drawn upon to assist in the completion of pilot demonstration projects where and when United nations funds were not available for that purpose.— ’—■gwiijm By this means the Economio Survey Mission seeks to provide against the collapse of a pilot demonstration project through lack of funds to carry it to its planned conclusion, and to stimulate the spirit of enquiry and research in those Middle Eastern countrie° whose hopes are set on this essential need hut which have hitherto lacked the means to achieve their just and purposeful desires.ASSISTANCE TO KiLESTINE REFUGEES Roaolution adopted by the Ganeral Asaembly at its plenary meeting on U December 1949.^ Tho General .-Lssembly , Rocalling its resolutions 212 (ill) of 19 November 1948 and l'94''(Tll'5 of 11 December 1948, caffirming in particular the provisions of paragraph 11 of the latter resolution.

The approach to economic development in the Middle Laet proposed Ly the Economic Survey Mission thus includes the following elements: . hocogniti cn by the governments of Middle Eastern countries, by the United Nations and by the Member Governments which desire to proffer friendly assis tance to the Middle East - (i) that peace and stability cannot be achieved in the Middle East until the masses of its peoples are a- le to enjoy a higher standard ■ of living than at present; (ii) that the path to a higher standard of living for the population of the Middle East is a long one; (iii) that, through the efforts of Middle Eastern peoples and governments themselves, a higher standard of living can only be achieved through the development of the natural resources cf Middle Eastern countries whichc . to begin with, should be reflected in an improved and modernized agriculturej without which substantial industrial opportunity is denied them. (iv) that the obstacles to economic development present few, if any, opportunities for the immediate prosecution of large-scale schemes or the fruitful application of large long term credits for iDroductive, s elf-liquidating deve 1 opmen t s; (v) that the proposed public works programme to provide temporary employment for Palestine refugees, as recommended in the Economic Survey Mission’s Interim Report (adopted and approved by the General Assembly of the United Notions, by a Resolution No. dated 8 December 1949), by mobilising a great body of manpower, now idle, will improve the pro ductivity of the countries whore the refugees now r eside andean be the start of larger developments;(vi) - that several of the governments of the countries most directly affected by the recent hostilities between Arabs and Israelis need an ; opportunity to learn, by doing, the art and skill of planning, organizing and carrying out a development project, conceived on a small enough scale to be within the competence of those governments, important enough to affect the country's economy favourably, and com prising a sufficient variety of problems and technical requirements to afford overall training in a broad field, while being simple enough- to assure success; (vii) that the process by which the greater resources of the international community and the individual aid of friendly govern ments are nude available to the Middle Eastern countries must respect the sove reignty while strengthening the competence and independence of the country receiving assistance• Prosecution of the programme of work relief for refugees to be inaugurated by The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (established by a resolution of the General Assembly dated 8 December 1949) in such a manner as to shift more and more responsibility for the execution of the programmes on to the shoulders of.the individual governments and to ensure that these 'programmes for temporary employment include those projects which can add to the productivity of national and regional economies and lay the basis for subsequent larger developments offering a permanent livelihood to more people in the years to come. 3. Establishment by each of the Middle Eastern governments of a national Development Board, fully contained within the s overalgn jurisdiction of its governmental administration, charged with responsibility for planning balanced, overall development, defining and recommending individual projects, and providing for their execution, with the help of such technical and financial assistance from the international/■ international community or friendly governments as each Mi die Eastern government concerned may seek. h (a) Prosecution hy the Government of Lehenon of a pilot demonstration project to achieve a complete survey, field investigation and technical report, preparatory to the ultimate development of the Litani River as a unit; (h) Encouragement and te c hnical assistance hy the international community, or individual friendly governments, to the Republic of Lebanon in the definition and prosecution of the Litani investigation with an assurance that, should the Government of Lebanon find itself unable wholly to finance, this investigation from internal resources, a request for external financial aid would receive careful and friendly consideration. ( a) Prosecution by the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan of a pilot demonstration project on the watersheds and stream bed of the Wadi Zerqa, and a pilot demonstration project on the watershed and stream bed of the Wadi Qilt, which will achieve the full and unified development and use of the waters of these wadis flowing into the Jordan River from the east and west respectively; by building storage dams, to stabilise the down-stream flow of the wadis and thereby increase the year-round water supply, reduce the damage of floods and add to the areas under irrigation and cultivation; by using the development of these wadis as an opportunity to employ~Arab refugees and as an encouragement for them to establish themselves as permanent and productive residents on the lands they thus bring into use; and by using these pilot demonstration projects as a special opportunity to provide technical and administrative experience in the overall planning and :ctual execution of public works. (ty('£&gt;) financial and technical assistance to the Jordan Government hy the international community^ through the funds to he made available by the Member Governments of the United Nations for the refugee worksrelief programme, in order to begin these projects; together with an assurance that later requests for credits or grants v/ith which to complete these pilot projects will receive careful and syrrpathetic consideration by the United N 0 tions or by individual friendly governments, prior to the conclusion of the refugee works programme. (a) Prosecution by the Syrian Government of a pilot demonstration project on the Orontes River in the Ghab Swamps, to reclaim, by drainage and other devices potentially fertile lands now useless and uninhabitable and to provide homes and other facilities needed for the people who will berequired to populate and till the land thus reclaimed. (b) Encouragement and technical assistance by the international community or individual friendly governments, to Syria in the planning and execution of this project by the Syrian Government, with an assurance that, should the Syrian Government find itself unable wholly to finance this development from internal resources, a request for external financial aid would receive careful and friendly consideration. Creation of a fund , not to exceed $10 million, by the governments which, by action of the General Assembly, are called upon to appoint their representatives to form the advisory Commission of The United Nations Relief and Works x.guncy for Palestine advisory Commission, • until expended, for allocation to Middle Eastern governments as grants, reimbursa! 1 $ or otherwise as may be determined for the purpose of facilitating research, technical studies/studies end investigations in agriculture, engineering and other modern scientific aids to development, and assisting in the completion of pilot demonstration projects opppoved 'by the Advisory Commission, upon application made Toy the Middle Eastern government concerned, 8 , Pre-par at ion hy the governments of the Middle Eastern countries concerned, in consultation with the Advisory Commission of The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees and in connection with the functions of that body as laid down in paragraph 7(h) of the 8 December 1949 Resolution of the General Assembly, of plans and recommendations for the further development of the economic and natural resources of the Middle East, with particular reference to those involving economic arrangements between two or more of the countries concerned. This approach to the economic development of the Middle East and the policies and actions set forth herein are recomnended for the early and careful consideration of the United Notions and the governments whose active implementation of this approach will bring the Middle East into a hopefljl and significant era of economic, social and political advance.

As far as (a) was concerned it is considered that the survey period is now over and that a number of schemes are now ripe for execution, A priority list of projects has accordingly been drawn up in consulta tion with Departments in London and is nov/ communicated to U,S. Government for their consideration, and in hope that they would support its proposals. Record of discussion between Mr, Michael Wright and members of the State Department, (Communicated by the State Department)• SECRET November 14# 1949 POINTS ARISING FROM THE DISCUSSION ON LONG RANGE DEVELOPMENT IN THE MIDDLE EAST (a) Actual v/orks measures. (b) Drive for the improvement of social conditions. 2. The U.K. feels that the cost of long range development in the Middle East is of manageable proportions and will yield substantial results. 3* Thn-U.K, had no feeling of reserve or antagonism tov/ards the United States taking a more prominent role. 4. In the view of the U.S. Government and the U.K. the Arabs must take the major responsibility for carrying out development work. For this reason and in viev/ of national susceptibilities it would be profitable to work through Development Boards set up in the Middle East countries themselves. Any regional development organisation arising out of the ESM report could assist those Boards in technical matters and coordinate outside assistance forthcoming as a result of the E.S.M. report. 5. From the U.S. point of viev/ the Point Four and any long range development programme must be coordinated with the Clapp report. It is important that the Clapp report lay the basis for longer range development programs. The Foreign Office proposals (see (l) above) might be communicated to Clapp on a personal basis. 6 , U.K. and U.S. Government agreed that the area should not be parcelled out into spheres of influence 1 ’. It was also agreed that it would be desirable to approach long range plans on a country to country basis. 7 7. In general private capital was not attracted by the type of project envisaged for the Middle East countries. The U.S. Govern ment emphasised that Point Four program did not involve direct financial assistance and that other countries must be prepared to contribute to development programs./ 4. Record of discussion between Mr. Michael Wright and members of the State Department, (Communicated by the State Department.) SECRET November 17 f 1949 DISCUSSION ON LONG-TERM DEVELOPMENT • IN THE MIDDLE. EAST BASED ON PAPERS SUBMITTED BY FOREIGN OFFICE REPRESENTATIVE 1. Mr. McGhee said that he had carefully read the Interim Report^ of the Middle Eas^ (Official) Committee on Economic and Social DeyeiQ* ment and found himself in general agreement with the policy outimea therein. This policy was consonant v/ith President Truman s Point Four Statemerirb and also with the statement which he issued at the time of the establishment of the Economic Survey Mission. ..The interim Report of the Economic Survey Mission did not cover Egypt and Iraq but with this difference the two reports fitted in well together. Any differences in the United States* thinking were mainly matters oi ^ emphasis e.g. the United States connected the P roble “ ° f lv development with that’ of the Palestine refugees generally more closely than was the case in the M.E.(O) C. report. 2. Mr.McGhee said he wished to consider the question of technical assistance to the Middle East under the Point Four »FSe^vail - 17 the impact of the large number of American experts who would be able,both £n the British position in the Middle East and on the Middle East countries themselves. Around five million dollo.ro t d able for the Near East under the Point Four program and this represented a very LS nSmhor of experts. The availability of technicians would, in all probability, be the limiting factor, not funds available. There was the possibility that in exceptional cases Point Four funds e available to pay the salaries of suitably qualified local technicians. Nevertheless, the number of American experts in comparison -with ,the eight or nine experts at present employed by the B.M.E.O. The problem of coordinating the British and American efiorts in the technical field was clearly important. Mr. Wright said that he warmly welcomed any effort ^which^tho^United States Government felt it could make in the technical field in Middle Ealt^ On this subject, the United Kingdom Government had abso- 1 n+alv no reservations. He pointed out, however, that a survey work had already been done.In the Middle East and that WhaV was generally required was not fresh surveys and winter visitors hut the selection and execution of projects which had already worked^out. a rHri Tint of course, mean that no survey work was required Mr. foredicatiLrpartic^r.rly'irthftectoical^ield^whlcrmanf competent observers thought was the ultimate key to the problem. !FsrS\?rS hu? here too there, was an inevitahle risk of duplication.v.. v • . -2- / 8.' 4. Mr, McGhee said that such arrangements might be neat and tidy from the organisational point of view but there was the danger that the Middle ISast Governments would consider them as an attempt to develop the Middle Bast from the West and they would'consequently resent it. In the diplomatic and political field the United States had no ^ coordinates mission in the Middle Bast. Coordination was effected in Washington and Mr. McGhee thought that in the field of technical assistance the coordi nation. of American effort throughout the area might best be effecte in Washington. This was the case as regards South American and effort there was coordinated by the Institute of Inter-American Affairs in ? Washington, He agreed- that it might be preferable not to embark on any new' organisation in the field as the risk of any charge of imperialism would in ; this: case be less and there was also the point that communications with Middle East capitals were easier from Washington than from any point in the Middle East, Coordination between the British and the Americans could best be achieved in London and Washington, 5. As regards loint Four assistance in the educational field Mr. McGhee said that American experience in Latin America was that assistance^on the primary and secondary level was likely to raise political, religious and social difficulties. Technical or vocational training on what was known as ,l basic' education ’ 1 was on the other hand a field in which the Point Four assistance might play a part. In connection with'water ^ * surveys for Cyrenaica and Tripolitania, Mr, McGhee said that the Point Four budget 'had not yet been worked out in detail and that American representatives in the countries concerned and.the local governments would need to be consulted. He recognised the need for the execution of projects already surveyed rather than for new surveys but the diffi culty was that Point Four legislation aa at present proposed only provided funds for the salaries of experts and for limited technical equipment, 6 . , Mr, Wright handed : Mr. McGhee .as background information to the recom mendations contained in the M,E,(0);C. Interim Report copies of reports on economic and social development in Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Aden and. ex-Italian colonies. Mr, Wright agreed that the United States should send copies to the. American representatives concerned on condition that they should not discuss the reports with the local governments or give any iDublicity to them in the press# * 7. Finally, Mr. Wright said that he had been authorised to discuss with the International Bank.the recommendations contained in the interim report, and also a suggestion for the . 1 establishment of an International Nile Waters Advisory Board. He inquired whether the State Department- would care to send a representative to be present at the talks. Mr. Wright explained-that the membership of the International Board would be confined to the principal technical advisers 'of the government con-* cerned though it might be attended by a representative .of the Inter national Bank as an observer. It was intended that the Board would serve as a. link with the International Bank and that it might 'serve as a pattern .'for similar organisations in other areas. He emphasised that it' was important in order to avoid any possibility of Slav intervention that Nile waters, development should not be dependent on the United Nations. The International Bank was, of course', another matter and the proposed Board might also call on-United Nations’ technicians; under the expanded program- pf technical assxstance# He emphasized toe great experience which the Egyptians had in the control and utilisation of .

(iii) The coordination of United St a ^ e 3 an&lt; 3- United Kingdom effort in the field of technical assistance couHbest be achieved in London and Washington. This matter would be further studied in London and at Conference of United States representative at Istanbul. (iv) It was recognised that groat progress had already been made in surveying the economic resources of the Middle East and that wrat was most required at the present state was the execution of selected. projects. Approved by Mr. McGhee and Mr. Wright. November 20, 1949.COHFIDENTTAT, 1005/^36/49 MINUTES OP THE MEETING HELD WITH PRESENT: Mr. Garner - Vice-President M. Hist Mr. Hoar Mr. Wright Mr• Evans Mr. Greenhill Mr. Garner said that in the light of the Bank’s experience the development projects listed in the British Paper appeared to be among the most useful. It was the % function of the Bank to assist in projects of this kind; the Middle East represented an important under-developed area. The Bank could help not only in connection with indvidual projects but was also in a position to use its influence to improve the general administrative and financial practices of the area. It was the Bank’s practice before studying any projects in detail to examine the general conditions obtaining in the country concerned and was able to make useful recommendations. He suggested that the Bank was*able to make representations in a way that was often difficult for H.M.G. or the U.S. Government. The Bank belonged in part to the countries to v/hich it addressed itself and it was therefore in an unique position to offer advice. Charges that the Bank was operating in the interests of Anglo-American imperialism were becoming less and less. Mr. Garner said that the interests of the Bank were in no way contrary to those of H.M.G. 2. Mr. Hoar said that there v/as need for selection of projects and that the Bank was in a position to advise on the establishment of priorities. The projects listed in the British Paper represented basic development require ments and that the Bank would consider to what extent it /couldcould endorse the projects selected and could then make an effort to persuade the governments concerned to accept the priorities involved. 3# In the course of subsequent discussion regarding projects not included in the Britinh list Mr. Garner said that he believed that the Iraqi proposal to develop its oil refining capacity had been dropped* An American firm interested in the construction of the refinery had anproached the Bank but had been informed that in the Bank T s view irrigation and railway development should have priority. 4. Mr. Wright said he fully agreed that the Bank could play an important part in improving the general position in Middle East countries. Referring to the Economic Survey Mission’s Interim Report he said that the work of the Mission was essentially constructive and had been the result of excellent team work. The relief works programme represented a lead-in to the further development of economic resources of the Middle East. The implementation of the Interim Report raised the question of finance. He emphasised that he hxd no authority to commit H.M.G. in this respect. It was, howev'er, apparent' from his conversations with the State Department that on the American side there was a desire to make the programme a reality and it was possible that the U.S. Government would be prepared to finance • * 50% of the cost. The salary of experts formed a considerable cost element in Middle East development but expenditure in respect of American technicians (or in certain cases even of local technicians) might be met from American funds available under the Fourth Point Programme. He also referred to H.M.G*’s one million pounds interest free /loanloan to Jordan, The Bank were actively interested in the Iraqi projects and had expressed their interest in the Nile Waters Projects. The pattern of finance might therefore he beginning to emerge. 5 . Mr. Garner said that apart from oil, agriculture represented the most promising field of development in the Middle East. There were however possibilities of developing minor industries to supplement basic development in agriculture and it was* the Bank ! s policy to stimulate private investment to play its part in this direction. He referred to the Bank’s efforts in Turkey where there was considerable scepticism Doth in government and in business circles of the state control of industry. Arguments in favour of state control in Turkey did not 'appear to be ideological. The feeling was that if the State did not make itself responsbile for industry•there would be no one else to do it. Business interests on the other hand are feared to enter the industrial field in competition with the State. The Bank had received an • invitation to send an expert to study this problem and some progress had been made. There were opportunities for some minor industries and some private capital was available locally. The Bank would be prepared to participate in loans for this purpose and some American financiers were also showing interest. The possibility of the establishment of a Management Company was being considered. Mp, Garner referred to the Bank’s interest in certain industrial projects in Iran for which some private capital might also be available locally. The availability of foreign exchange was not the main difficulty. It wasof course important that a degree of foreign management should he assured. In general such minor industrial undertakings on the basis of private enterprise were a necessary addition to public works. ?• Mr. Garner said that the development of health and education services were essential but pointed out that the Bank was unable to assist in this field. Here again foreign exchange was not the main difficulty although suitable experts were essential. He referred to the vocational training being provided by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company in Abadan which he described as the finest he had seen. He suggested that adequate publicity was not being given to this effort and added that there would be advantage in the company extending the scope of the scheme and providing vocational trainign for people outside their employ. In general funds which would be available under the Fourth Point Programme might ^0 allocated to the development of vocational training. 8 . Mr. Wright recalled the wartime experiment involving the training of Egyptian peasants in mechanical work by British foremen. This had been highly successful. 9 . Mr. Garner said that the two principle obstacles to development were:- (a) the provision of local currency, and (b) the provision of currencies other than U.S. dollars. The Bank would have no difficulty in making dollars available *. % but it was inadvisable for the countries concerned to assume larger hard currency obligations than were necessary for the implementation of projects. The availability of sterling depended on the willingness of H.M.G. to allow /forfor the 18 $ capital contribution to be used or to permit loans to be floated on the London market* In either of. tnese two cases the borrowing, governments would be able to service the loan in sterling. If, on the other hand, the Bank acquired sterling by the sale of dollars, the borrowing government would be obliged to repay the loan in dollars. It was recognised that the servicing of a dollar loan might be a drain on British dollar reserves, 10, Consideration v/as given to the problem of tapping local financial resources for development purposes particularly to the accumulation of wealth arising from oil royalities in Saudi Arabia and the Persian sheikdoms. It was suggested that te Arab rulers might be encouraged to invest in the Bank’s bonds. 11, Mr, Garner said that if further progress v/as made in Turkey in connection with the encouragement of private investment the Bank’s experts might repeat the experiment in Arab countries. The possibility of a Management Company on a regional basis might then be considered* he said that Mr. Bayne had gone to Persia to advise the Persian Government on the best way to present loan applications to the Bank. He would also gain first hand experience of the operation ©f the Development Board and the foreign experts working with it. This would be valuable in connection v/ith other countries in the Middle East. He also said that he hoped that agreement would shortly be reached between the Bank and the Colonial Development Corporation. 12, The Bank was anxious to avail itself of British experience in the area, Mr. Garner added that Bank missions had found the co-operation of the British Middle East Office and of British diplomatic missions in the Middle East most valuable.13. Kr. Wright said that it ifas the wish of His Majesty’s Government to see the economic development of the Middl East achieved with the co-operation of all friendly « Governments &lt; . international rivalries which had handicapped work in the area in the past should be. eliminated, 14. It was agreed that the exchange of information which had been effected at the present meetings was most valuable and, that informal contacts should be maintained. It was also agreed that a record should be prepared showing the points on which identity of views existed.(j 9368 / 14210 / 16 ) RECORD OP MEETING HELD AT INTERNATIONAL BANK, TUESDAY, 22ND NOVEMBER. PRESENT: Mr. R. Garner (Am.) Vice-President, International Bank. Mr. Rist tJ?r. ) Loan Director, International Bank. Mr. Hoar (Br.) Assistant Loan Director, International Bank. •Mr. Schmidt (AmJ Assistant to the Loan Director International Bank. General Wheeler (Am.) Engineering Adviser, International Bank. Mr.. Stevens (Am.) Loan Office International Bank. Mr. WeIk (Am.). Economist, International Bank. Mr. Stevenson (Br.) Economist, International Bank. Mr. Rosen (Am.) Economist, International Bank. Mr. Bohenski (Polish) Economist, International Bank. iit the request of the Vice-President of the Bank, Mr. Wright recapitulated H.M.O.'s attitude towards develop ment in the Middle East area and explained the circumstances m which M.E.O.C. Interim Report and its annexes had been drawn up. The representatives of the Bank v/ere passed a paper (attached) on the International Kile Waters Advisory Board and their comments were invited. « 2. Mr. Garner replied that he agreed generally with the principle that the countries should be made responsible themselves for their economic development. He had discussed the possibilities of the Nile Valley Authority during his Mr. M. Wright Foreign Office. Mr. T. Evans Foreign Office. Mr. D.A. Greenhill British Embassy.visit to Egypt and was anxious to offer the good offices of the Bank in this matter. He had no wish to lay down a blueprint for the organisation but welcomed an exchange of ideas. The development of the Nile Valley was an imaginative project in v/hich the Bank was prima facie very much interested. The Bank’s point of view was three-fold:- (i) It preferred to lend money to a government direct or, alternatively, to an international Authority which was proportionately guaranteed by the Governments concerned. (ii) If a loan was made to an Authority, it was • - desirable that the Authority should be set up on a self-liquidating basis. The Authority diould, in the Bank’s view have a source of revenue apart from national budgetary alloca tions which would assist the amortisation of the debt to the Bank (in this connection he suggested- that a File Valley Authority might derive revenue from the sale of water). (iii) To be effective in the Middle East area, the Bank must have command of sterling and currencies apart from the dollar. These projects, including the Nile Valley scheme, did not demand heavy dollar financing but the predominating currency required was sterling. The Bank’s problem was to find the sterling and although the Bank had sterling funds on its books, these could not be utilized without the consent of H.M.G. t/ .3. Mr. Hoar pointed out the difficulty of meeting the local expenditure involved in these projects. Countries concerned had very limited resources and the Bank itself could only help create local currencies in an extremely restricted manner. 4. Mr. Wright pointed out that he was in no position to commit H.M.Gr. on the question of the provision of sterling but said that he hoped that other countries involved, e.g. Prance would participate in the schemes. 5. Representatives of the Foreign Office and the Bank then examined in detail the schemes listed in the annex to M.E.O.C. Interim Report. The Vice-President of the Bank explained that his organisation had been prepared to assist tho Egyptians in the filet stages of the Quena project but that Egypt had felt herself capable of going ahead without outside assistance, ,a.s far as Iraq was concerned, the Bank Mission was at present in London, en route to Baghdad, and they hoped to arr nge a loan which would cover the financing of the Wadi Tharthar and Diyala schemes. The total sum involved was 8.4 million dollars for construction machinery, 5.1 million dinars and B1 .8 million. In the Lebanon, the Bank had indicated its willingness to go up to #1 million for a loan for irrigation and were anxious to get a foot in the door of the Lebanon. They lelt that the Lebanese Government were perhaps folding off pending the results of the Clapp Report. The Bank had received, no serious approach from the Syrians and could not help Jordan as she was not a member. 6 . ns far as the establishment of development boards were concerned, Mr# Garner said that the objective of the Bank was to attempt to separate the responsibility for development from the constantly changing governments. For this reason it would like to see set up separate Authorities for the developmentV -4~ of cortain products or industries with independent budgets which would remove the necessity of passing their operations - through the national budgets. An over-all board with strong ministerial representation had therefore ? from the Bank’s point of view, certain weaknesses. Mr. Evans pointed out the advantages of an organisation oh the lines of the Sudan Plantation Syndicate and said he hoped it might be possible to follow this precedent in certain Middle East countries. Mr. Garner referred to American experience in Colombia wh^re the municipal water supply of Barranquilla was run by a board of which the members of the Chamber of Commerce and the municipality were represented with a foreign general manager. This experiment had proven outstandingly successful over several years.(E. 14307/1103/65) Minu’tes of Meetlnp; Held at the International Bank Wash ington! Monday, November 21st, 1949* Present: Mr« Eugene Black - President, International Bank Mr. R. Garner - International Bank Mr. G.H. Tansley - International Bank. Mr. M.R. Wright - Foreign Office Mr. T. Evans - Foreign Office Mr. A. Christelow - U.K.T.S.D. Mr. D.A. Greenhill - British Embassy Mr. Wright said that His Majesty's Government had for some time been considering the desirability and possibility of development in the Middle East. Their attention had been directed to this problem before the war and more deliberately since the war. Since 1943&gt; detailed surveys had been made and it was felt that the time was now ripe for constructive action. Before proceeding, K.M.G. wished to' inform the International Bank and to ascertain its attitude to these questions. In their opinion the Middle East was an area with classic possibilities of development. Schemes should aim to increase productivity and eventually be economically self-supporting. He was glad to put at the disposal of the International Bank a summary of the schemes which H.M.G. had examined. Mr. Black expressed the Bank's interest and enquired whether H.M.G. envisaged an over-all authority for development or whether they considered development should be carried out through the individual countries. Mr. Wright replied that H.M.G. was anxious to build up the self-respect of the countries concerned. It was therefore their intention that these schemes should be done on the responsbility of the countries themselves. The Arab countries were slowly learning the art of self-government and their full participation in these development plans would assist them in attaining true independence. H.M.G. considered that each of the countries should establish a development board responsbile for the schemes and that each country should be /dealtdealt with individually for the purpose of finance. As regards the Nile Waters project the situation was different. Several countries were involved in the problem and the Egyptians themselves had inherited an unrivalled knowledge of the manage ment of the river. H.M.G. v/ished to get the Nile project out of the political arena and for this reason they v/ere examining the idea of an International Advisory Nile Waters Board located at Cairo. This Board should be a strictly technical organisation v/hich would plan and advise on projects but which left the responsbility for the execution and finance of the individual projects to the governments themselves. It was probably desirable that the Chairman should be an Egyptian. The Bank might perhaps be represented by an observer. Mr. Garner replied that the proposal seemed acceptable and after-expressing again the Bank's interest in the development of the area undertook to organise further meetings to discuss the problem in more detail.Record of conversation between Mr. Michael Wright and members of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development in Washington ' November 25, 1949 JOIN T MEMORAND UM Subj: Meetings Held on 21st, 22nd, and 23rd of November, 1949, concerning Middle East Development. Mr. Eugene Black, President of the Bank, was present at the meeting ^n the 21st of November. Mr. Robert Garner, Vice President p attended all meetings as also did Mr. Wright of the Foreign Office. A list showing those who were present at the meetings is attached. On the basis of the informal discussions which took place, there was general identity of views on the following points. 1. It was recognized that the Middle East represented an important underdeveloped area and one in which substantial progress might be made at a relatively moderate cost as compared with other comparable underdeveloped areas. 2 . Projects for the development of the economic resources of the area were of interest to the Bank. 3. The projects listed in the Annexes to the British Paper were of the type whifib merited serious consideration in connexion with any programme for the development of the area. 4* The importance of handling the projects in such a way as to make the maximum contribution possible towards the further development ox a sense of responsibility and administrative capacity on the part of those in authority throughout the area was recognized. 5* It was recognized that there was need for further evaluation of development projects in the area. The Bank would be prepared to assist interested governments in (a) the formulation of overall programmes of economic development, (b) the establishment of priorities for individual projects, (c) the improvement of administrative and financial methods in the area. /WithWith regard to (c), it was recognized that memher governments of the Bank would more readily accept objective criticism and advice from their own institution than from any other agejacy, however objective. Moreover, in view of its international character, the Bank might be particularly effective in assisting in formulating and working out practicable arrangements for handling projects involving two or more countries. 6 . In order to achieve the continuity and assure the administrative competence required for the successful operation of the projects, it was agreed that the execution of the projects should as far as possible be removed from the atmosphere of politics. Development Boards appropriately constituted appeared to be one of the means of attaining this end. 7. Most of the projects included in the Annexes to the British Paper were of the type which could not readily be undertaken by private enterprise. It was felt, however, that the successful execution of these projects would tend to provide a basis for the more effective development of the area by private enterprise. 8 . Particular attention should be paid to the possibility of tapping local sources of capital, notably the exceptional accumulation of wealth which will arise from oil royalties in Kuwait and certain other Persian Gulf Sheikdoms where- development possibilities appear limited. 9* The Bank pointed out that their participation in these projects would give rise to the following considerations: (a) Loans by the Bank must either be made to or guaranteed by a member government. For a project entirely within a country, this requirement should give rise to no special problem. For projects involving more than t^ne country, consideration would be given to an arrangement that would permit each participating government to give a guarantee of its pro rata share. For projects of the latter type, the Bank would favor the establishment of an International Authority, and in view of the considerations outlined in paragraph 6 above, would favor the delegation to the Authority of the maximum possible administrative independence. It was agreed that an International Nile Waters Advisory Board as outlined in the British Paper or on . similar lines would be a useful step forward. (b) The dollar requirements of the projects under consideration appeared to be comparatively small, and it would be inadvisable for the countries concerned to assume larger hard currency obligations than would be necessary in order to finance the projects. The Bank’s ability to assist in financing the sterling element would depend on the extent to which the United Kingdom would be prepared to make its 18 % capital /contributioncontribution available for this purpose or to allloans to be floated on the London market* Tne other important element of the total cost (the most important element in a number of cases) would be incurred in local currency. The Bank could assist in financing this only in exceptional circumstances* (c) To the extent that projects could be made self-liquidating on the basis of revenues and receipts obtained other than by budgetary appropriations on the part of the governments concerned, the attractiveness of the projects would be enhanced. Particular attention°should be paid to the problem of assuring adequate funds for the maintenance of projects once completed. 10. It was agreed that the exchange of information on Middle East development problems had been of value and that informal contact on them should be maintained through the British Embassy in Washington.

WG/Kt$H.MIDDLE EAST (OFFICIAL) COMMITTEE EC ONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE MIDDLE EAST PERSIAN GULF STATES The attached paper, prepared by the Committee f s Working Party, is circulated to the Committee for information. T. E. EVANS (Signed) M. M. du MERTON. CABINET OFFICE, S.W.l. I9th December. 1949 .20 THE PERSIAN GULF STATES IKTRODUCTIOB : POLITICAL STATUS OF THE PERSIA^! aULi)' til/TU'S 1. With the exception of the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman, which is an entirely independent State, the Persian Gulf states are considered to be under the protection of Kis Majesty's Government, who are responsible for the conduct of their foreign relations biit are not directly responsible for their internal affairs. In Muscat His Majesty's Government enjoy considerable influence by reason of their long association with the Sultanate. DESCRIPTION OP THE PERSIAN GULF STATES ; 2 . (a&gt; Muscat . The Sultanate of Muscat and Oman consists of the main body of the State lying around the Ha jar range in the South-East corner of Arabia, and of two appendages - the coastal plain of Dhufar and the port of Gwadur on the Makran coast* The only towns of- any size are the ports of MuscatMatrah and Gwadur, and of these Matrah, which is the largest, contains only 9,000 inhabitants. The main occupations of the State are fishing and agriculture. The Muscat fisheries (comprising sardines, tunny fish, sharks, etc.,) are among the richest of their kind in the world. In '1947 Dr, G.L.‘ Bertram of St. Johns College, Cambridge, carried out a survey of the fisheries for the Sultan. He estimated the present annual catch to be about 100,000 tons, of which about 40,000 are exported, and recommended that the fisheries could.be developed along modern lines by eliminating present wasteful methods of use and establishing modern methods of preservation and of utilization of by-products. Captain Charles Kendall and Partners, who arc employed by the Sultan of Muscat as his purchasing agents, are now considering the possibility of forming a company with local participation and of obtaining a concosoion from the Sultan for the development of the fisheries. . . ...... • . . ; i 3* Apart from fish, the State's economic resources are slight. There are certain possibilities of agricultural development which have been and -are being surveyed for the Sultan by Mr. Hartley, Director of Agriculture in Aden, involving expanded irrigation, improvement of date cultivation and introduction of new crops such as sugar. Muscat also possesses in the province of Dhufar, mineral resources of limestone, gypsum, talc and lead, and Sir Cyril Pox, formerly the director .of the Geological Survey of India, who surveyed the province for the.Sultan in 1947 , considered that it might be possible to utilize these resources for the development of a chemical industry. There.are also very small and hitherto unexploited coal deposits at Sur. 4* So far, oil has not been discovered in Muscat. Petroleum Concessions, Limited, one of the I.P.C. Group of companies, have recently completed a geological survey of Dhufar, and are anxious to begin operations in the South Coast of Oman, which is, however, at present politically unsafe for*penetration. Unless and until oil is discovered or the fisheries can be exploited on an important scale, Muscat will lack the financial resources for development, and its economy will remain a poor and primitive one. 5* (b) Bahrein This State consists of a gtoup of small low-lying islands situated half-v/ay down the Persian Gulf, some20 miles off the Eastern coast of Arabia, The total population is about 100,000, The State formerly subsisted almost entirely on its entrepot trade and on its pearling industry, which today is moribund. Apart from oil (see ^ belov), the State possesses no economic resources. About one-twentieth of its area is cultivated under irrigation, and recommendations for intensifying and improving the State’s agriculture have recently been made by Sir Herbert Stewart, Agricultural Adviser to the British Middle East Office. 6 , In 1932 oil was discovered and is now being exploited by the American-owned Bahrein Petroleum Company. l-ro''uction is at present sta.tic at about 1 .$ million tons per annum, and it is estimated . that.the present proven reserve will be exhausted in about 50 years. The Bahrein rennery handles a throughput of about 7 , 3 m illio n ' tons of crude oil per annum, of which 5 &lt; 8 million tons is imported from Saudi Arabia.. 7• Por the past 14 years Bahrein has received oil royalties amounting to about £ 250,000 per annum, v/hich were increased in 1-948 to £ 365,000 per annum and which will probably now be further increased as t a result of the current oil royalty negotiations. These royalties account for nearly half of the State’s revenue, the balance being derived mainly from customs duties. For over 20 years the State has been administered by Mr, Carol Belgrav'e, the Sheikh’s British adviser, and under his sound guidance it has become probably , the best administered non-British State in the Middle East. Haunted by the prospect of the exhaustion of the oil reserves, the Sheikh and Mr. Belgrnve have agreed in pursuing a conservative financial policy. The oil royalty income (apart from the Sheikh's share.which is one-third of the total) has been allocated partly to capital expenditure on revenue- producing schemes and partly to a reserve fund which now amounts to about £1 million. This fund is invested mainly in Government of India securities on which a return of 2 - 2 ' to is received. The Government of India have so far refused permission to the Bahrein Government to sell these securities. . • . . ; • 1 8 . Although under Mr. Belgrave’s administration much development of public amenities - schools, hospitals, roads, electricity, telephones, etc. - has already taken place, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf considers that there is considerable scope for further development to improve the amenities and social conditions in the State, and that such development could absorb the oil•royalty, revenues- for some years to come. 9« (c) Kuweit . This State is situated at the North West corner of the Gulf, and consists of a waterless desert which is roughly a square of 90 miles in each direction. The total population is estimated at about 150,000, of which 70,000 live in the town of Kuweit. Apart from oil (see below), the Stat^:^ ^c^nomy is based upon its entrepot trade and ship-building industry. It is the natural port of North- East Arabia and trans-shipment port for the produce of the smaller Gulf ports .and of India. Kuweit is’famous throughout the Gulf for the ship-building of native craft (dhows), for which the timber is imported from the Malabar coast. OwingOwing to the complete absence of* water there is no scope for agricultural development, ^ Burgan oilfield in Kuweit is the largest single sand oilfield in the world. The Kuweit Oil Company, which is naif British and half American, began production in 1946. In 1948 output had already reached 6.2 million tons. Production in 1951 is expected .to amount to 25 million-tons .and.in 1956 to 38 million tons. In 1947 the Ohoiii of Kuweit received £500,000 in oil royalties, and in 1948 £ 1.5 millions. Royalties for 1949 are expected to amount to £ 2.9 million and by 1958 it is estimated that they will have reached the level of £15 million. In addition the Sheikh has received /4 million dollars for his share in the concession rights in the neutral zone (this sum is believed to be lying intact in a New York Bank), and he receives also a minimum annual payment of 625,000 dollars. 11. The Sheikh of Kuweit has consistently refused to ' • employ a British administrator or Financial Adviser. Unlike Bahrein there is no tradition of British advice and ojur interference is, in fact resented. As a result the ' , administration of the State and in contrast to Bahrein is primitive and chaotic. The Sheikh 1 s policy is at present essentially conservative, and neither he nor his people realize the possibilities and problems ra.ised by their immense acquisition^of wealth. A substantial amount of development of public amenities is, however, taking place in an unplanned and haphazard way. The Political Resident at Bahrein considers that there is sufficient scope for improvements to absorb a substantial part of the oil royalty income for some time to come. ■ (d) v^ntar, This state is a peninsular .on the Arabian mainland about 100 miles long and 30 miles in width. It is almost waterless and consists largely of low barren hills. -The population which is only about 16,000 has hitherto subsisted largely on pearl diving* Petroleum Development (Qatar) Limited, a British subsidiary of,the. Iraqi Petroleum Company is now established in the State, and commercial oil production is expected to start in January 1950 and to amount to 2 million tons in that year. The Sheikh wj._l 1 then receive £450,000 in oil royalties. In 1956 production is expected to amount to 3 million tons and oil royalty receipts to £ 675 , 000 . The new Sheikh,.who has just acceded to power, has agreed to appoint a British Adviser who will,, it is hoped, be ;able to ensure that the oil roya .1 ties-are spent on sound development projects or suitably invested. 13. (e) Trucia l Coast. Tho Trucial Coast consists of seven small states: f . Abu Dhabi, Ajman, Dubai, Um A1 Qawain, Ras A1 Kllaimah. and Kalba . • ' on the Itfw-oLying coast to the east of the Qatar peninsular. The largest town, Dubai, is said to possess 38,000., inhabitants. Oil has not so far been discovered, but Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Limited, ^ subsidiary of the Iraq Petroleum Company, is planning to undertake drilling operations early in 195^. Other development possibilities are limited to the developmentdevelopment of water resources, which may bo possible on a small scale, and fishery development which might be undertaken in con.iunction with the Muscat fisheries# HI. UTILIZATION OF OIL ROYALTIES 14. From the above brief description of the economic situation in each of the Persian Gulf States, it will be seen that an unusual and remarkable problem is presented. In these States (except to a limited degree in Muscat) there are virtually no possibilities for any major long-term development of natural resources, other than oil where it exists and development of oil does not require artificial stimulation# The lines of development can therefore only lie’ in the provision of public 'amenities, the improvement of social conditions and certain very limited agricultural improvements# Yet three of these states - Bahrein, -Kuweit and Qatar - are earning, or are about to earn, sterling and dollar revenues on a scale out of all; proportion to their current needs for financing development on these lines# In the Trucial Sheikdoms, there is a reasonable prospect that oil will be discovered. There is, perhaps a certain irony in the fact that in the last state, Muscat, which is ■ the only state that possesses resources that might be-cap)able of reasonable development (fishing, agriculture and minerals) no oil has yet been found and the prospects of finding it are considered uncertain# 15. In addition to the oil royalty revenues which are pain to the Sheikhs, the oil companies dre expending-large sumo locally in Bahrein, Kuweit and Qatar# A condition of inflation may thus develop ip. these states, a.nd the time has probably now come when it would be advisable for the Sheikhs (if they could be persuaded to do so) to introduce taxation - direct or indirect - in order to mop up excessive purchasing power# Such a policy would, however, Incrca.se the already surplus Government revenues# 16. The outstanding problem in the Persian Gulf Stoofces is therefore that of investing wisely the surplus revenues of those States which possess oil resources. The first charge on these revenues must obviously be the development of the States themselves on the lines indicated above# Such development will involve: (a) revenue producing capital development projects e*g# power stations, harbours, etc#, and (b) non-revenue producing capital development projects e.g# schools, hospitals, etc. As regards (b), It has been % suggested by the Treasury representative in the. Middle East that the Sheikhs concerned should be encouraged to pursue a- policy of endowment, involving the investment of a capital k sum in British Government securities to produce an income sufficient to cover the estimated annual recurring expenses of the institutions concerned. Such capital sums would be allocated to specific objects and schemes and administered hv a Trust., 17# No attempt has so fe.r been made to assess with a.nv exactitude the. extent to which the oil revenues of these ' v States can be wisely devoted to local development# It is clear, however, that Kuweit and Qatar at any rate will, during the next few years, dispose of a larger revenue than that requiredrequired to finance development programmes conceived on sound lines and adapted to their needs. The possibility therefore arises of securing the investment of these funds in some way which would utilize them for development in other Middle East countries where great resources exist hut funds to exploit them are lacking - e,g t Syria, Jordan and possibly the development of the Muscat fisheries. This suggestion has been informally put to the Sheikh of Bahrein by Mr, Belgrave, his British adviser. The Sheikh has indicated that he might agree to invest his reserve (if he can succeed in selling out his Government of India securities) in some form of Middle East Development Corporation, provided such a Corporation had the support, if not the guarantee, of the British Government, In the case of Kuweit it is considered that it would at present be premature to make a similar suggestion to the Sheikh but it is hoped that the Financial and Commercial Secretary, who is shortly to be appointed to the Residency at Bahrein, will be able to influence the Sheikh to adopt, a sound financial policy and in due course to raise the question of the investment of his surplus revenues with him. In the case of Qatar, the approach to the Sheikh will similarly have to wait until his British Adviser has been appointed and has established his position in the State, IV. RECOMMENDATION S (a) We should exert our influence to the fullest possible extent to persuade rulers of the states v/hich have, or shortly will have, substantial oil revenues - i.e r Bahrein, Kuweit and Qatar to conserve their surplus incomes wisely until plans for the sound utilization of these surpluses have been formulated. (b) We should encourage the rulers referred to in (a) to prepare plans primarily for the improvement of the lot of their peoples. These plans should bo carefully balanced in the light of available financial resources and of the requirements of the states between: a) Non revenue - producing capital development projects - schools, hospitals, etc. (ii) Revenue ~ producing capital development projects «• communications, improved water supplies, etc. The plans might .include provision for the endowments of certain projects under (i) above, possibly by investment as in (c) below. (c) It is clearly desirable that if possible ways and means should be found in v/hich oil revenues surplus to the re quirements described in (b) above could be invested and utilized for development in the Middle East. A separate study of this problem should be undertaken by the Working Pa^ty. (d) We should encourage the development of resources other than oil (e.g. fisheries) when such development is economically sound; and should guide economic and social develolment on the right lines by assisting and advising the Gulf States in measures required to improve their standards of administration^£933 JND 2 X 2 D (THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC WiJ'Sr r TY T § T he Social and Internal Political Implications of Economic Development in the Mi e East The attached statement of our general policy regarding the promotion of social progress In the Middle East was prepared as a brief for the Chairman*s recent discussions with the State Department in Washington* It was communicated to the State Department, who expressed full agreement with it, and who subsequently transmitted it to the recent conference in Istanbul of united States heads of Missions in the Middle East# CONFIDENTIAL MiE«(0)(49)34 8 th December, 1949 COPY NO ^ &lt; CABINET MIDDLE EAST (OFFICIAL) COMMITTEE (signed) T.E. EVANS M.M# du MERTON, CABINET OFFICE, S.W.l 8 th December, 1949mmThe Soci I and Internal Political Implications of Economic hevelopaent in the Mid d le, Sast« Our primary aim in promoting economic development in the Middle East is to raise the standard of living of the masses of t the people. This is of the utmost importance, 'both from the humanitarian point of view and also in order to ensure :internal political stability, v/hith is the only effective bulwark against the threats of Communism or Fascism. Economic development, as such, is thus a means to an end rather tlian an end in itself .' 2* On the other hand, economic development along sound lines is,the- essential basis for social progress and political stability. Without it the countries of the Middle East cannot, generally speaking, become capable of affording the cost of social development. . 3. . The Middle East Governments are, in general, enthusiastic about the idea of undertaking development projects. They do not, however, appear fully to realise that such prefects cannot in themselves provide' social and political stability. It will be essential to ensure (a) that the wealth resulting from the projects is equitably distributed and used to the advantage of the whole community and (b) that the financial resources of the State are not unduly deployed on economic* 'development, thus leaving no resources available for expenditure on social progress while the projects are being carried out. Failure to meet requirements (a) and (b) ‘might well be to increase existing social inequality and discontent. Moreover, ..unless the application qf modern scientific and engineering methods to the exploitation of a country's resources5 resources is accompanied 'by the development of a ’‘modern 11 mentality and consciousness in that country, it may lar^ly defeat its own end. The projects involved will he improperly or not fully utilised and inadequately maintained. Finally, the impact of Western scientific materialism* unaccompanied 'by Western idealism, on conservative and ignorant peoples,nay have a powerfully disintegrating effect, and sej?ve to foment social disorder. 4# For these reasons, it is of the utmost importance that economic development projects in the Middle Bast should he accompanied hy comprehensive measures of social development and reform - and these in their turn will he the essential background for political development. Expenditure on development i-/rojects (which are expected to yield financial returns) and on social services (which cannot, of course, yield any material returns) must he carefully balanced, and if necessary the pace of economic development must he slowed down in order to provide for social development. The latter will comprise: (a) Land tenure reform; (b) Fiscal reform, involving more equitably taxation; (c) . Administrative reform - improvement of central and local Government services; (d) Improvement of health services; (e) Development of education; •' (f) Introduction of progressive labour policies; (g) Development of social insurance; « (h) Development of co-operation; (i) Development of public utilities and social amenities - electricity, housing, etc.5« These various aspects of social development will have, in their turn, to he carefully balanced as -part oi an overall programme. It will, for instance, be unwise to embark on c. complex system of social insurance (as is proposed in the Lebanon) without some measure of administrative reform to ensure its effective execution. The development of social amenities may not succeed in allaying social discontent unless accompanied by an enlightened labour policy (compare the work in both these directions of the Oil Companies in Persia and Iraq.). . Moreover, since the social problems of no two countries in the Middle Bast are the same, the emphasis which it is desirable to place on the various aspects of social development will differ from country to country. In Egypt, for instance, where the outstanding social problem is that of over-population, the improvement of'health services, may merely aggravate an already serious situation. In Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, the outstanding need is probably to establish the basis of a modern fiscal and administrative system, since without these, social policies cannot be put into effect* 6 . In all these countries, hov/ever, education may be considered to be the key to social and political progress* Without it, all reforms and all development will be based on an unsound foundation, since they will be imposed on uncomprehending and inarticulate people. With it, the active and intelligent co-operation of the people in their own development will in the long run be assured. Education will enable the Arab world to overcome its sense of inferiority towards the Western world, to assimilate the benefits which that world has to offer, and to reject its disintegrating influences.8. MM influences# It may even prove to lie the one satisfactory long-term solution to Egypt *5 over-population problems* Ihe pace and scope of educational development will, however have to be carefully regulated, since were it greatly to outstrip other aspects of social progress, the result would again be mass discontent. It is also most important that the development of education should be related to the general plan of economic and social development, and that the right balance sliould be struck between primary, rural, technical and higher education. Broadly speaking what Middle East countries need most for successful development are a few good statesmen and a lot of good foremen. The nresent educational systems are producing neither, but only a mass of second rate lawyers and politicians. 7. An outstanding opportunity for promoting social development in the Middle East is offered by the proposed large-scale development of u new” areas, e.g. the Jezira area in Syria and Iraq, the irrigable areas in Iraq and in the Jordan valley, and possibly certain parts of Persia. In the Sudan, a system of tripartite organisation, involving a corporate venture on the part of Governments, tenant farmers and commercial interests, has been adopted in such areas with outstanding success. In this way the tenarts may be gradually educated in modern techniques aho. enabled, in due course, to take over the management themselves. The.establishment of such organisations in the nev/ areas would not only ensure their sound development but would probably also provide a great stimulus to social progress in other areas of the countries concerned. * t8, Tlie following are the ways in which His Majesty’s Government can promote social development in the Middle East: ^a) By the offer of advice through the British Middle East Office and the British advisers employed 'by the Governments concerned (we are now hoping to increase the nurnhar of such advisers By a policy of loaning officials in cases where the Governments cannot pay adequate salaries). (h) By the exanvjie' set By the social and laBour policies of British Companies (in particular the Oil Companies); (c) By the example set By the administrations of Cyprus, Auen and the Sudan. (The former is Being increasingly visited By Middle East authorities to inspect e.g. co-operative developaent, malaria control and forestry training). (d) By promoting the provision of education By (i) British private schools; (ii) the British Council, and (iii) the supply of British teachers to non—British schools in the Middle East. (Considerable numBers are employed in Iraq and Egypt). (e) By attaching when possible suitable conditions - e.g. regarding fiscal and administrative reform - to any loans for development which we may make. (f) By co-operating fully in the work v/hich W.H.O., F.A.O., I.L.O., and U.N.E.S.C.O. are doing to promote social development in the Middle East. 9. As indicated in paragraph 4 above, social reform is the Background to political development, and it may well provide the impetus for such development. Social and political reforms, introduced too quickly or too drastically, might well prove explosive. It is therefore essential that progress should be cautious and should follow the lines of genuine organic growth.I vi'r v • I ^ ( THIS 'DOCUMriNT 13 THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAKMIC MAJESTY f S^G-OVERfgijM fT) ■ vl V # ' gg.

Political The Sudan is an Anglo-Egyptian condominium. Under the terms of the Condominium Agreement of 1899 and the Anglo—Egyptian Treaty of Alliance of 1936, the Governments of Egypt and the United Kingdom are jointly responsible as co—domini for the -Sudan s intornational relations, but delegate responsibility for the good government of the country to the Governor—General who is appointed by the King of Egypt on the recommendation of His Majesty’s Government. A radical reform in the direction of self-government was brought about by the Executive Council and Legislative Assembly Ordinance of the 19th June, 1948, under the terms of which the Governor-General (with the approval of His Majesty’s Government out^without the consent of the Government of Egypt) constituted an Executive Council and a Legislative Assembly, Not less than halj. of the members of the Council must be Sudanese, and the great majority of the members of the Legislative Assembly are also Sudanese. To those two bodies the Governor-General has delegated executive and legislative powers respectively, without prejudice to his ultimate responsibility to the co-domini for the good government of the Sudan. In order to fulfil this latter obligation, he retains very wide powers, which include a casting vote at meetings of the Executive Council and the right to veto any decisions reached by the Council. Moreover, the Ordinance speciiically prescribes certain reserved matters in respect of which the Assembly has no legislative powers. The Egyptian Government regard this Ordinance as invalid and the unity of the Nile Valley” is a slogan now common to all Egyptian political parties. The partnership of the co-domini is therefore, at best, uneasy, and the efficiency of the machinery of the condominium suffers accordingly, in particular as regards the management of the Sudan’s external'relations. ■ The country is divided into eight provinces, each under a Governor responsible to the Governor-General. The provinces are sub-divided into 46 districts, each in charge of a District Commissioner responsible to the Governor concerned, Functionins in association with the Governors -and District Commissioners are executive and advisory councils and other local authorities.Gonoral description# (i) Tho first or Northern region, extending from the boundary with Egypt t.o near the latitude of Khartoum, has an average rainfall of less than 100 millimetres each year* Here regular agriculture can only exist on lands watered each yjar, by natural flooding or by irrigation. (ii) Tho second or Central region covers the areas where the average annual rainfall ranges from 100 to 600 millimetres, extending approximately to the 12 th parallel of latitude. Here certain types of crops c an be grown by rain; in tho northern part of the region only on a very limited scale, and when conditions are favourable; further south with more certainty, but still subject to the variable incidence of the rains. Since the season of rains is short, the possible crops are in general limited to Dura and other types which mature quickly. In this region irrigation is essential if the crops \iiich have a longer growing period, and which are such a valuable source of revenue, are to be cultivated. Irrigation can also be used to guarantee a dependable food crop, which will be a valuable safeguard in case of a year of bad rains and consequent shortage of rain-grown crops 4 The central belt of the Sudan is the site of the Gozira scheme which extends to some 900,000 acres of irrigated land. Here is grown tho long staple cotton on which the economy of thQ country mainly depends. In the Nuba Mountains area west of tho White Nile there has also been started a flourishing cotton industry producing good quality American cotton as a rain crop. Prom the central belt also comes the Sudani export of sesame, ground-nuts and gum arable. Gum exports are now in the region of 28,000 tons a year, and provide a steady source of revenue to tho country: and Sudan is the w r orld source of supply for gum arabic. Tho southern part of the central belt contains thousands of^square miles of savannah country with dark clay 'cotton' soil, from which good crops of grain rind oilseeds can be produced if water can be made available for a cultivating population, and recent Government policy has been to develop the water supplies in this area and to increase the out-put of food croios by mechanical methods. (iii) The third or Southern region covers the remaining parts of the Sudan, where the average annual rainfall is more than 600 millimetres. The figures of rainfall continue to increase towards the South, until on the frontier with Uganda they are ovox* 1,200 millimetres per year. The Southern belt may in years to come be economically valuable to the country but at the present time it plays little part in the Sudan’s economic life. Distance from the sea and tho costs of transport render its products of little value by the time they reach the port. Soil and crop surveys are now being carried out and it is hoped that w r ith an expansion of agricultural effort this southern area may be made at least self-sufficing., (b) *4*Progress made ia agriculture? The ocanomic plight of the Sudan in the days before the establishment of the present Government was desperate. The agricultural and pastoral population, which had been decimated by long years of famine, disease and armed conflict, was engaged in an unequal struggle against the natural poverty of the country. Living a primitive and precarious life in remote districts .and hampered by the absence of any modern means of communication, the people were often out of reach of help from their own country-men and always from the outside world* The failure of crops in one season brought hunger and two consecutive failures caused famine# The paramount need was for the country and its inhabitants to bo equipped with the means to prevent or minimise natural disasters and for the foundations to be laid on which the best use could be made of all its natural resources. The economic history of the Sudan for the first quarter of the 20th Century was, therefore, one of progressively increased acreage being put under cultivation, of efforts to improve agricultural methods and of the rapid growth of communicati ons. The material improvements enjoyed by the people as a result could not then and cannot now be statistically measurad on the basis of consumption per head of the population. Nevertheless a fair impression of tho steady raising of the standards of living is given by trade figures. The improvaiaont received a marked‘impetus; after 1925 p when the results of tho Gezira scheme (described in annex A) began to be felt. The war years have been followed by a period of unprecedented economic prosperity due to the steady rise in world prices of the Sudan’s agricultural products .and the shift of the terms of trade in her favour. Agricultural schemes (i) Tho Gezira scheme is more fully described in annex A, This scheme now covers an area of 900,000 acres, and a further extension is planned. The basis of the scheme is tho production of a cash crop - cotton - with the aid of a specialised management supplied by two Companies. In addition to cotton food and fodder crops are grown, so that a stabilized centre of food production has been established in the Sudan: when the rains fail, irrigated crops are ' available to prevent famine. Alternative Livelihood Schemes. These were some 70,000 semi-nomad families designed to provide land was inundated by the construction of the Jebel with a settled way of life. By 1944, 45,000 acres settled, and 35,000 more acres have been planned. Gezira, the cash crop is cotton and other crops and livestock are included. The main difference between these schemes .and the Gezira scheme is that the Government itself has undertaken the administrative work from the start; and that no large-scale cultivation machinery is used, but tenants are encour,aged to form ploughing cooperatives. whose Aulia dam had been As in tho alsom (Ill) The Gnsh board* The Gash dalta is in tha Kassala province adjoining the Sritrean frontier* the river is a flood river, and the flood is highly charged with silt. The alluvial land is divided into parcels by low banks and sheet irrigation is practised. The present policy is to irrigate annually about 35#000 acres for cotton; the rest of the land is put under dura or kept for light grazing. The Zande Scheme Capital of about 1,000,000 is being sunk in scheme known as the ’’Zande” scheme in order to hasten the social emergence' of one of the less backward of the primitive tribes in the South. The scheme aims at producing ample food (including sugar) the cultivation of cotton for a local spinning and weaving factori'* the opening of properly conducted trading centres at which the people will learn to sell their products and buy their needs in exchange for money instead of goods, since their present economy rests on barter. Mineral Resources • Geological Surveys and the activities of numerous prospecting companies and individuals over. the. last 45 years have revealed no proved mineral resources apart from small quantities of gold. No signs of oil have boe*n discovered. Industry The Sudan is, and must remain, primarily dependent on agriculture: it is unsuited for large-scale industry for a number of reasons. There is a lack of first-class raw materials suitable for local processing (other than agricultural products): the population is not sufficiently large to provide manpower for industries on a large scale: there is a lack of any form of natural fuel or-power; the climate is difficult: and immense distances separate raw materials from the markets of the world, thereby providing a deterrent to industrial expansion on a grand scale. Nevertheless a number of small industries exist. A modern mechanical tannery and a cement factory have been started, and several up to date though small oil pressing mills have been installed. In addition a large moat- canning factory is under construction: it is to be managed by Liebigs, should be in operation by 1951, and has an anticipated throughput of 100,000 head of cattle per annum. 6 . Commerce and Trade The volume of trade in 1948 reached the record figure of £E 46,000,000 as compared with £E 21,000,000 in 1945* Sudan exports have increased from practically nothing in 1S99 to approximately £E 15 , 000,000 in 1947 and £E 24,000,000 inin 1948* Ginned cotton accounted for £16*000.000 of rLi 3 la ^° r sam: notable exports are cotton-seed, gum arable, a variety of agricultural seed crops, camels, cattle, sheep and hides and skins. ^ *5JP3rts have increased in a similar way and in 1947 were £S 16,200,000 and in 1948 £S 22,000,000, 7# Pinance (a) General The Sudan uses Egyptian currency and thus has a strong ^th In viQW of its Q conomic relations B ritain and Sgypt, the monetary policy of these Powers is a matter of great importance to the Sudan, u f Li ^ 1 ° r account is the Egyptian pound (£S), 100 piastres (P.T,), exchangeable at 97 t 5 piastres to the pound sterling, (b) Budget The budgetary results of the government for the past three years have been' •. * •* ^ 1946 1947 1948 • • • • • • t« • • • • »• • • • • Revenue £S 2,288,985 10,141,495 12,782,346 ' Expenditure £E 8,207,802 9,U34,667 I - *,320,352 Surpliia 81,183 706,828 1,461,994 162,394 (For comparison) 5,053,765 4,890,8T1 ( c ) T_axation and other Tnv taxes in the Sudan are Land Tax, Crop Tax, Animal Tax, House Tax and Business Profits Tax.

(b) Public Health Public Health Services, which were also non-existent at the start of the Administration have been systematically developed. Between the years 1924-1946 the number of in patients in Government hospitals has increased six-fold, the number of operations performed seven-fold, and the number of out-patients f attendances twenty-fold. Major epidemics have been practically eliminated and the general improvement in public health has led to a big increase in population. (c) Labour and factory legislation Labour and factory legislation has recently been promulgated and an organisation sot up for its enforcement under the supervision of an official seconded from the British Ministry of Labour. (a) Cooperatives The initial steps towards the development of co-operative methods of organisation have been taken; some of the staff required have been appointed and others are being trained. IQ# Present Development Plans Economic development in the Sudan is coordinated by a Board of Economics and trade, on which are representatives of the Departments concerned. The president of the Board is director of the department of Economics and Trade. A development programme estimated to cost LB 10 millions was started in 1946 to cover the five years 1946-1950. The main items arej- Agriculture(iii) Agriculture and Forests (including LB 1,000,000 for the Zande Scheme.) 1 , 500,000 Irrigation (principally the extension of the Gezira Scheme by 100,000 acres) 1 , 500,000 Posts and Telegraphs 450,000 Civil Aviation (including LB 88,000 for inauguration of an Internal Air Service) 125,000 Urban water and Electricity Supplies 480,000 Rural Water Supplies and Soil Conservation 380 , 000 Roads and Bridges 390,000 Education Endowment of Gordon Memorial college 975,000 Buildings 1 9 1 00,000 2 , 075,000 Medical Buildings 500,000 Buildings other than education and medical. 1 , 200 , 000 . This programmo of LE 10 millions is boing financed as to •Sstg* 2 millions from a special grant-in—aid from the British Crovornmont and as to tho remainder from the Sudan Government^ pdsorvesv ^In addition, provision has been made for the capital of LS 3a millions which will be required by the organisation which is boing set up to take over the management of the Gezira Scheme in 1950 from the Sudan Plantations Syndicate, Limited, and the Kassala Cotton Company, Limited. Further development (a) Main requirements. The main requirements for further economic development on any considerable scale are:- (i) Man-power. There is not at present sufficient man power for large-scale industry or for a large increase in the area under cultivation. (ii) Capital Tho Government has not only not resorted to the capital market for nearly a quarter of the century (except for a conversion operation) but has reduced the public debt by LB. 10 millions. With the exception already mentioned - the British Government’s grant of £stg, 2 millions it has financed all development expenditure from revenue. When cotton prices fall, revenue will not be able to take care of more than minor capital expenditure. Major items must be financed by borrowing. A loan for further development will bo required when the current 5 -year plan is completed: the prospect of this has already been mentioned to the treasury.(iii) An adequate supply of qualified experts. Despite persistent efforts to recruit them, the Sudan Government is still short of various categories, notably agronomists, entomologists, veterinary research officers, engineers and doctors. Details of the actual vacancies existing on 21st November 1949 are given in Annex B. (iv) Political Stability This is essential if the Sudanese people and Administration are to be left free to devote their energy to the development of their country’s economy. The progress already achieved will be jeopardised if time is wasted in political agitation, whether it is engendered from within the Sudan or incited from without. To maintain this stability, British guidance must continue to be exorcised both in Khartoum itself and from London* (v) The Sudan Government would welcome a comprehonsivo exploratory survey such as is described at page 57 of the United Nations document, ’’Technical Assistance for Economic Dovelopment”. ’’The main purpose of such a survey would be to assist the requesting country in analysing its problems and in formulating a development programme that would define the most feasible methods of achieving improved standards and set out the priorities to be accorded to different projects. The survey would indicate the ways in which various services available through the United Nations and the specialised agencies could be so utilised as to interlock and reinforce one another and provide maximum support for the country’s own efforts at economic development. The intornational team of exports would work in close co-operation with the Government of the country concerned, and would take account of the existing economic structure, the governmental machinery, the natural, human and financial resources of the country, the social institutions and-values of the people, and other local characteristics bearing on economic development.” Such a survey would be of great value economically and politically to the Sudan Government. The Sudan’s status may well lead to considerable difficulties in securing the services of such a team; but it is hoped they could be overcomc. (b) Probable lines of further development. The present 1946-1950 programme is severely taxing the Sudan Government’s technical resources and it is unlikely to be completed before mid-1951. Detailed thought has not yet been given to the next programme that is a task which will have to be tackled next year but certain lines of further development stand out very clearly;■f— ( i) Further extension of _irr igation. It is estimated that at least 2.8 million acres are irrigable by systematic irrigation from the Nile as compared ^ with the present area of about 1.2 million acres* Soil and contour surveys are now being made to determine the total irrigable area more closely but they w r ill take several years to complete. The Sudan is, however, now using, or will shortly be using, the whole of her entitlements under the Nile Waters Agreement and any further expansion is dependent upon the Lake Tana and Equatorial Nile Projects. The raising of the level of Sennar reservoir, which is provided for in the technical agreement with Egypt on the Lake Tana project, offers a more immediate prospect of relief; this would give an additional 150 million m3 of stored water at relatively small cost if Egypt can be persuaded to agree to it in advance of the construction of the works at Tana. Assuming that the necessary water can be secured and it is economically justified, the extension of the irrigated area to 2.8 millions or more acres would take many years to achieve. (ii) Furthe r extension of drinking water supplies by surface storage tanks and bores to open up new areas for cultivation and to permit a greater utilisation of the country*s cattle resources* (in) Developm ent of rainl ands* The plains of the Central Sudan, now sparsely populated because of lack of water during the dry season, offer the prospect of a groat increase in agricultural production If exploited by modern methods. A pilot scheme for mechanical crop production started a few years ago is now getting over its toothing troubles and similar schemes elsewhere are now being considered. The emphasis at present is on the production of dura (sorghum) but attention is being given to other crops. If these plains can be turned into the granary of the Sudan, it may then be possible to eliminate grain from the rotation in the irrigated Gczira Scheme and thus release expensive stored water for more valuable crops. (iv) Furth er expansion of educatio nal and health services* For the 10-year education plan, see Paragraph 8 A. A similar programme for health services is now being drawn up and it will provide for a considerable increase in hospitals, rural health centres and child welfare and ante—natal clinics r However, with ‘in economy so dependent upon agricultural hazards and the price at which .cotton can be sold in the world*s markets, the expansion in social services must be cautious* (v) The losson l ng of tho country's dapondonoo on cotton bv uu uu kxuluj uuiure une dost; solution is found*In the meantime the potentialities of industrial expansion are small* It is not the Governments policy to invest in industry but instead to encourage private enterprise# 12* Recommendations for action by His Majesty^ Government: It will be appreciated that the Sudan is not a country capable of development in order to settle migrants or to add materially to the world supply of raw materials. Thus the objective is the steady improvement in the circumstances of the indigenous population. It is recommended:- (i) If the Sudan Government apply to His Majesty 1 s Government for a loan for further development. His Majesty f s Government should consider the request sympathetically* (ii) His Majesty’s Government should assist the Sudan Government to recruit the technical experts which it requires. (iii) His Majesty’s Government should assist the Sudan government to obtain the services, through the United Nations, of an international team of exports to advise on development problems and to draw up a comprehensive programme.THS GEZIR/i SCHEME ^ In 1925 the Sennar Dam and canal system were completed c-nd the first 300,000 acres of the Gezira plain put under irrigation* The Scheme, which now covers 900,000 acres of the Gezira plain, is operated on a partnership basis between the State, as represented by the Sudan Government, the people, as represented by the native cultivators and a ‘'specialised management' as supplied by the Sudan Plantation Syndicate and the Kassala Cotton Company whose suitability for the task had been established by their successful operation of the earlier pilot-schemes in the Gezira and a large pumping scheme in the Northern Province. The basic shares of the three partners in the scheme are: tenant, 40/o, Government 40%, and cotton companies 20 % - a division which follows the local historical custom for the sharing of irrigated crops between the cultivators on the one hand and the owners of land and implements on the other. Apart from its immense economic value to the Sudan, the Scheme is of wide interest for its sociological character and achievement. Although not comparable in size with the giant Tennessee Valley Administration, the Scheme has some similarity in principles and has been faced with some greater obstacles in practice, e.g. , the problems of developing a backward people in need of foreign capital but in fear of foreign domination, of organising agriculture on sound competitive lines where it has limped along on a peasant basis for centuries of giving the farmer the strength of a corporate organisation # and the necessity of doing all this in an atmosphere of co-operation strong enough to capture the imagination and support of the people as a whole. The use, but not the ownership, of the land has been nationalised, i.e., no individual owner can keep his land out of the Scheme or hold the country to ransom on the terms of entry. The Government has assumed entire control of and responsibility for the land, paying the owners as compensation a rent equivalent to the highest market rate before the Scheme started and giving them, in addition, original priority option to tenancies. A primary purpose of the Scheme was the production of a cash crop and, after many difficulties which were overcome by the achievements of the Government's agricultural research institution, that purpose has been fulfilled. The areas gfed were devoted mainly to the cultivation of high-grade long-staple cotton. By means of its direct and indirect revenues, the Scheme now makes a substantial contribution not only to the general costs of the administration but to the development of the social services of health and education and of now agricultural underta. ings in other parts of the Sudan. Apart from the Government's share, the cash payments to the 20,600 tenants, which now amount to more than a million pounds a year, greatly stimulate the circulation of trade. /Apart* ' ^ Apart from his oash re turns ? a tenant harvests an average g* op of 3t tons of millet per holding which provides more than sufficient to feed his family and labour and a good supply of straw for his animals. He can also grow a leguminous crop for fattening his animals and a vegetable crop for his own use. Thus the basis of the scheme has been widened from the main pursuit of a cash crop to the building up of a balanced farming society with due attention to animals vegetable and food supplies so that any setback which may affect the export crop may reduce only the cash returns and may leave unimpaired an enhanced standard of nutrition and health. i The co-operative advantages which the tenant enjoys are noteworthy. He need provide no capital at all. He pays no rent for land or water and his crops are free of tax. He gets loans with which to hire any extra labour that is needed. He has the benefit of scientific research to select his seed, choose the best rotation for crops, and protect them from disease. Instruction, supervision tools and materials are all provided. His cotton is transported, ginned and marketed for him. If his yields are bad, artificial manures are supplied to him, not at his own cost but as a charge on all three partners. If his land gets foul, mechanical ploughs clean it, not at his own cost but as a charge against the tenants as a whole. Finally a substantial fund has been accumulated to tide him over bad years. But although he has all these benefits of co-operative socialism, a tenant does not have to pool his profits or his crops with his fellows. His cotton profits are paid to him in accordance with the yield of his individual holding and his grain and other crops belong to him alone. The first stage in the history of the Gezira Scheme will be completed in 1950 when the Companies* concession comes to an end. Their pioneering purpose has been fulfilled and the whole asset of the scheme will become the property of the country. The special manangement will continue in the form of a public utility board which will retain as its executive agents a proportion of the present small supervisory staff until such time as they can be replaced by Sudanese. The success of the scheme can be judged from the fact that it has conferred immense benefits on the population and has contributed towards, giving the Sudan a stable economy; and in addition has enabled the Sudan Plantations Syndicate, who are now due to wind up, to make a substantial return on capital invested.ANNl.X B RbiCRUITIVIBNT OF ?-IXPkPTR The following is the list of Tctcancies which existed 21st November, 1949: Ministry of Agriculture 2 Assistant Soil Gonservation Officers 1 Plant Physiologist 2 Agricultural Entomologists 1 Agricultural Entomologist (Plant Protection) 1 Agronomist Veterinary Service 1 Veterinary Entomologist 1 Veterinary Research Officer Ministry of Health 1 Lecturer in Anatomy 1 Bacteriologist 3 Medical Officers Public Works Department 1 District Engineer Posts and Telegraphs Department 2 Meteorologists,l *—•*’ (2^-9 ^ ^ AU./4^C. 4sf+.c '-&gt; — o*—* ^ Stx(L tL &lt;&amp;*- 'h-^ ^ «t (b-K.&lt;*-&lt;\ . x&lt;h Miss Emery In his minute of 16th November on file Pol.Ext.54/1 attached Mr. Maclennan asked for these papers to be brought up again on the 1st February for further consideration of the question of departmental responsibility within the Commonwealth Relations^ Office for relations with the Middle East (Official) Committee. The papers which have been placed on this file since that date are predominantly economic in nature. Many of the recent ones are Notes on Technical Assistance to Middle East Countries, prepared as a result of the Middle East (Official) Committee’s instructions at its meeting of 3rd January (paper 109), their object being to prepare the way for further talks with the State Department on technical * aid before Congress comes to consider the fourth point for appropriations. On this basis it seems likely that the Middle East (Official) Committee will continue for some time to be preoccupied with economic matters. But it may be that there has not yet been time for the future bias of the Committee’s activities, which Mr. Thomson suggested in his minute of the 16th February would be political, to show itself. It seems questionable therefore whether the time is yet ripe to resume discussion within the Commonwealth Relations Office as to departmental responsibility. We ought perhaps in any case to await future discussions between ourselves and Western and United Nations Department as to the responsibility for the Middle East as a whole.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000691.0x0001dc_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/4757</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000691.0x0001dc</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/4757</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 54/1A(S) 'Middle East (Official) Committee: Reconstruction'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1949/1950</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-03-30T23:57:40</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (161 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in reverse chronological order from the front to the rear of the file.Numbers in red pen on the top right hand corner of each item in the file (apart from one item which does not have a number in red pen) refer to entries in the register of papers received and sent by the Commonwealth Relations Office at the back of the file.
