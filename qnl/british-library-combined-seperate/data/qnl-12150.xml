The papers contain letters, telegrams, and reports by a number of agencies that were largely coordinated from the Political Agency in Muscat. These include the Middle East Anti-Locust Unit, as well as Indian, Egyptian, and other international anti-locust experts, and agencies marshalled to the effort in Oman. Of note are several letters discussing the explorer Wilfred Thesiger's leadership of the anti-locust expedition into Dhofar in the south of Oman and the Hadramaut region of Yemen.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x0000f5#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x0000f5#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
