He lives in the desert as a bedouin and has large following among whom are numbers of ^oba and Beni Hussain — the latter a section of the Dhafir — both Iraqi tribe: Move into Iraq territory is normal Kuwait bedouin migration in ' early winter and from thence Subah al Nasir moves south through w Kuwait territory and eventually into Saudi territory as also do numbers of Bani Malik, Annan, Zuhairiyah, zoba, Ajwad, Badur — all Mantifiq and Hamar bedouin sojourn in Kuwait territory every winter — all armed. 5. Were Iraq to try to close their frontiers to the very few Kuwait bedouin who annually enter Iraq for a few weeks in early winter, Kuwait could not in retaliation prevent migration of Iraqi tribes through Kuwait but could certainly make it fw extremqly inconvenient and costly; and I would suggest that Iraq Government would be well advised to drop this protest. To pass it on to His Highness would only add fuel to the fire unnecessari^ ly, and I am withholding it until I have further instructions. Political *i Telegram Q, ^rom Political Agent, Kuwait. To.

In return, Subah Al N&amp;sir is allowed to be a law unto himself in the desert. I do not think we are likely to make much headway at trying to get His Highness to control him. His Highness was extremely loath to take action even when he flagrantly encroached on his own water well, and openly abused His Highness* own followers.

Shaikh Subah Al Naair, grandson of Shaikh Mubarak Al Subah, is the bedouin member and the bandit of the Al Subah* In 1927 he shot his brother in exceptionally unpleasant circumstances* The murder was committed in a car as both brothers were being driven to see the Ruler in respect of a difference of opinion between them. sUbah Al Nasir alleged that had he not drawn his revolver first his brother would have shot him; but this version of the incident is not generally believed. 2. After shooting him, Subah Al Nasir threw his brother out of his car and drove over the body several times. He then fled to the north-west corner of Kuwait and took refuge with the Beni Hussein section of the Dhafir, an Iraqi bedouin tribe where he made ’dakhala*. The Beni Hussain have been his friends ever since, and are closely associated with him in smuggling transactions to and irom Iraq. Shaikh Ahmed only got the Dhafir to hand ove-^ the fratricide after promising not to harm him. Shaikh Abdullah Al Jabir conducted the negotiations and brought Subah back to Kuwait, where he was confined to his house a close prisoner for six months. 3. To this day his mother has refused to have anything to do with him; and the rest of the Al Subah have as little to do with him as possible. On release Subah Al Nasir took to the desert. He only comes into Kuwait in the height of summer or during Ramadhan. He is never short of funds, and maintains himself regardless of expense and, to his friends, he is generous. *He keeps large flocks of sheep usually in the • Araifjan (near Ras Al Qaliyah) and the Neutral Zone seaboard areas, and maintains some 800 camels. He is married to the second sister of Abdullah Al Salim. His wife is also a sister of Bebe, the senior and official wife of the Ruler. 4. After the collapse of the Ikhwan rebellion in the winter of 1930, Subah Al Nasir took upon himself the right to reserve a large area of land for grazing. This was in addition* to his permanent reserve which had been given to him by the Ruler. The area appropriated extends from Umm Al Kiman, just south of Shiaibah on the coast, to the borders of the Neutral Zone. The area is some thirty miles by ten miles and is bordered on the land side by the Al Dhahor ridge and contains the Araifjan wells. 5. Subah Al Nasir T s usual migration is to go out in October'v;ith his camels to the Dibdibah and Al Batin areas in the western' part of the State, and to camp in the vicinity of Umm Amarat Mahzul. He sends his sheep down to the Neutral Zone seaboard where there is water. About February he moves to the Araifjan area with his camels and summers there. 6. Airing his sojourn in the Dibdibah area Subah collects round him a number of Dhafir (Beni Hussain) tribesmen, and later on some of the Zubair shepherd tribes, usually the Zoba, Al Barghut end Rafi/iyat tribes, old friends of his. These he uses to smuggle an: thing offering profit into Iraq; and in return they bring him rice and dates. None of his dependents, nor the tribes camped with him, have been short of rice since 1941. 7. When Subah moves south to Araifjan, the Iraqi shepherds accompany him; and by giving them favoured treatment and allowing them to graze their sheep in his reserves lie keeps triem by him and affords them his protection. In return he takes Hlaniha 1 and ’Dhabiha* from them, a perogative of the . Shaikh and an old custom by which foreigners' buy protection- 2 - and sanctuary. ^aniha’ nieans the taking on loan of a certain number of ewes for milking purposes during the sojourn of the -* tribe in foreign territory; end , Dhabiha t means the gift of a number of mole lambs from each tent for eating. To a'll other Iraqi tribes who usually move south us far as the southern border of the Neutral Zone access to the Araif jan grazin-; is forbidden; and if such are caught in the reserve, or even near its boriers, sheep are confiscated wholesale, and the owners driven off. 8. ^ Subah Al Nasir has in the past, however, been careful not to interfere with other members of the Al Subah who keep their flocks of sheep near the Araifjen wells. 9. In the spring of 1941 Shaikh Subah further arbritarily increased the size of his Araifjan reserve by extending its southern boundary twenty miles south into the Neutral Zone. .ie did this without His Highness T Knowledge or authority, but was later reprimanded by the Ruler because the move was likely to annoy Ibn Saud. 10. ^ The Kuwait Oil Company’s water well No.13, situated in the Shigaiya area in the south west corner of the State, has been fitted with a windmill pump and water tanks for the . use of His Highness 1 own flocks. In November, 1943, Subah Al Nasir drove off His Highness’ flocks and his bedouin flockmaster and placed an armed guard on the well to retain it for his own use. His Highness’ bedouin complained bitterly to His Highness, who did nothing. His head guard then resigned in disgust^and returned to his tribe. Subah Al Nasir remained in possession of the well until rain came and he had no further need of it. In 1944, His Highness used the well until November, and to prevent Subah Al Nasir’s using it thereafter he asked the Kuv.ait Oil Company to remove the machinery — ostensibly for repair and to close the well.

His Highness informed me that certain Iraqi bedouin had recently asked him whether they should pay •Maniha* to Subah Al Nasir, who had demanded it from them; and that he,His Highness, had sent word to Subah Al Nasir that he should desist from such claims. his claims to •Maniha* from all Iraqi tribes entering Kuwait territory, anri had impressed upon them that no one else had the right to collect it, and that any attempt to do so should be reported to him immediately. 5. The fact that His Highness has remitted •Maniha • is, however, generally regarded as a sign that he is either unable protection for which it is usually paid. undertake to protect them from molesta tion.

It is reported that three Iraqis who came to Kuwait recently to smuggle sugar were murdered possibly by Shaikh Subah an Nasir. In any case they have not since been seen and there is some excitement in Zubair as one of them is a Saduni and the other two are Muntafiq tribesmen. 2.

Disappearance of three Iragia in Kuwait, Sir 9 I ha/e the honour to refer to my telegram No.204 of the 8th March, 1948 and to inform you that one of the three Iraqis in question was Haji Hajab bin Mutlaq al Hamud as Sa’dun of the well-known Shaikhly family. The lorry in which they had left Zubair for Kuwait was found empty near the Mutla* , and they have not since been heard of; nor have their bodies been recovered. 2. It is generally believed that they were coming, to Jahra to buy sugar from Shaikh Uu’aij as Salman with whom Shaikh Subah an Nasir is on bad terms on account of rivalry in the smuggling business, and that Subah murdered them for this reason. 3. I visited the Shaikh on the 8th March and, in a stormy interview, told him that the smuggling activities of Subah. an Nasir were harmful both to Kuwaitand to His Highness 1 family find that , whether he was proved to have murdered the Iraqis or not, he should be removed from Jahra before worse befell, his Highness replied that this was out of the question and tnat he had frequently refused requests from the highest British Author ities to stop smuggling, and added that the Iraqis could not have entered Kuwaio as their bodies had not been found and that no official complaint had been made to him by the relatives. I then spoke plainly to His Highness on the advantages of frankness m dealings with the British authorities and his own shortcomings in this respect; and he has subsequently ordered that bubah an Nasir’s house in Jahra and his lorries should be coniiseated and that he should not leave Kuwait town. 4 4. It seems probable that the bodies of the Iraqis have been found and concealed again in a more distant part of tlie desert, but that it has not been possible to fix the responsibili ty definitely dn bubah an Nasir. The Shaikh is likely to satisfy the Sa’dun family by well-understood Arab methods, but officiallyofficially to deny that the missing men ever entered Kuwait or were murdered here. 5. If the incident has only resulted in^tho elimination of the three smugglers and the removal of dubah from Jahra little but good will nave been done; but there is a danger that the Shaikh will forgive Subah in a few months time and that he will restart his smuggling activities.

' The story which has spread round in Basra regarding the settlement between the two families is that the Sa*aduns are prepared to accept a settlement which involves banishment of Sabah al Nasir for a period of five years.

The lorry in which they had left Zubair for Kuwait was found empty near A1 Mutla*. A member of the As Subah family called Subah an Nasir who is engaged in a rival smuggling enterprise is suspected of having murdered the men , 1 but up to date there is no proof of this, nor has he been formally charged by anybody in the Kuwait courts. V The As Subah family are endeavouring to settle up the matter privately with the Muntafiq and have expelled Subah an Nasir from Kuwait. He sought refuge with Ibn Saud who refused to receive him and he is now reported to be in the Kuwait Neutral Zone.

This matt/er was discussed by me during my recent visit to Basra, and Mr. Littler, His Majesty’s Consul-General, informed me that the meeting between Shaikh Abdulla al Falih and Shaikh Abdulla bii Mubarak and Abdulla bin Jabir took place in the presence of the Mutassarif of Basra, who later communicated a report of the meeting to His Majesty’s Consulate- General. .No document or agreement, however, of any sort was signed, and ohe assertion that this agreement was reached rests on the Mutassarif’s report. The Consul-General also added thst in v5_ew of subsequent events, such as the war in Palestine ^ni martial law, the matter appears to excite little interest now in Basra. 3. Aliile there is little doubt that the suggestion of Subah en Mr sir’s exile was put forward and, as admitted by Abdulla Mubarak in private conversation, as good as accepted by them as a basis for negotiation, His Highness the Shaikh has recently confirmed to me that these two Shaikhs were merely sent to Basra in an exploratory capacity, and in no way given any authority to negotiate. He cannot therefore consider himself bound by the report of a verbal agreement on their behalf. 4. His Highness the Shaikh also pointed out that shortly after this meeting between Shaikh Abdulla al Falih and Shaikhs Abdulla bim Mubarak and Abdulla bin Jabir, it was claimed by Nasir el Ghubair that negotiations should by conducted with him, as Abdulla el Falih was not concerned in the matter: the Shaikh considers this claim correct. The latesfc position is that Nasir el Ghubair, while satisfied with the proposed terms of settlement, has also asked His Highness to sign a letter confirming that Subah an Nasir actually c omit ted the murder: this the Shaikh has naturally been un willing to do, and Nasir el Ghubair has recently returned to Basra. Political Agent, Kuwait.of the 29th November about the Subah - Sa’adun case, a copy of which has been sent direct to you? 2. All I heard in Kuwait during my recent visit, was that Shaikh Abdullah al Falih as Sa'adun had retired for good to Medina, and that the Kuwait authorities therefore considered the matter as closed.

We are now enclosing an extract from the letter of H.M. Consul, Amara, in which he reports Agab al Mutlagjs intention of attacking Koweiti territory and makes a new suggestion for the settlement of this tiresome case. You will have seen from our telegram under reference that the Jtutasarrif of Basra believes he can restrain Agab from carrying out his threat and it may be that the threat itself was not quite as serious as His Majesty^ Consul thought. Nevertheless, it is surely to the advantage of all parties that this question should be satisfactorily settled soon and it seems that the major responsibility for its remaining unsettled so long line with the Shaikh of Koweit. We would not agree to Colonel Berkeley's going to Koweit himself, as he proposes in the fourth paragraph of his letter, since the British interest in this matter is on the Koweiti side; but we should welcome your views on the possibility of a settlement on these lines being reached without the intervention of Colonel Berkeley. We ourselves are not too happy about this form of settlement, involving as it does the by-passing of Abdullah al Falih, the paramount Chief. In any case, If the Shaikh of Koweit cannot be prevailed upon to make Sabah ask Agab's pardon, the only solution appears to be the re-exile of Sabah and in that case we hope that means will be found to persuade him to take this course. We are sending copies of this letter to Kov/eit and Basra. Yours ever, CHANCERY. Political Residency, Persian Gulf, mmn-copx. CONFIDENTIAL . On tour 5th March, 1949 j Dear Davis, Last Monday I received the attached letter from Shaikh Agab al Mating as Sadun (the brother of the dead man). I proceeded to try to find out the feeling in the Muntafiq concerning this matter and yesterday again saw Agab who told me that about ten days ago he had seen the Mutasarrif of Basra reference this matter which originated last spring. The Mutasarrif expressed sympathy but said that the Iraq Government could not do much as the matter was in the hands of the British. Agab said that he warned the Mutasarrif that he was about to take the matter into his own hands. I have not my files with me but briefly the matter is as follows. Last spring the brother of Mutlag and his driver were murdered by Sabah, which fact is admitted by the Sabah family, who to make amends sent two of the family to Abdullah Fallah's tents where in the presence of the Assistant Mutasarrif of Basrah it was agreed that the case would be met if Sabah was exiled from Kuwait territory fofc three years, ^should be 5 years/ Agab though camped a&amp;out a quarter of a mile away did not attend this conference, but no sooner had the Kuwaities and the Assistant Mutasarrif left than he want to Abdullah and on hearing of the agreement repudiated it to the annoyance of all the Saduns and others present. Agab, together v/ith about 150 rifles struck their tents and went about five miles into Kuwait Territory at the same time sending messengers to mobilise the Muntafiq Tribes. That afternoon I visited Abdullah who explained to me the seriousness of the matter and the dishonour to him who had acted as the head of the Saduns. He appealed to me on the strength of friendship and influence with the Saduns to go to Agab and to persuade him to return to Iraq. Late that afternoon I found Agab in Kuwait territory with a number of tents and over one hundred•armed men. For an hour ^ I walked backwards and forwards with Agab. Among my points I told him that he was dishonouring the Sadun name as he must hold to the agreement made by the head of the family, Abdullah. Agab said that nothing had been done about his brother^ car which was held by Kuwait etc. In the end Agab agreed to accept my advice and returned to Iraq^j/^The matter ^ was then taken over by the Embassy, but Sabah aila not left Kuwait as promised. Agab told me this week that he was about to attack Kuwait with the help of the Muntafiq tribes at present in the desert and said that in this case our oil work in the desert would become unsafe. This would also apply to Kuwait territory as many Muntafiq tribesmen are now there for grazing. During my tour of the Muntafiq I found that opinion was solidly with Agab. For example Shaikh Mahomed NaFirullah of the powerful Nasrullah section of the Albu Saleh told me that he had some time ago given instructions to the sections of his tribe which go into the desert to follow Agab to the limit and this I believe applies to the many thousands of Muntafiq tents at present in the Southern Desert of Iraq and in Kuwait territory. The Mutasarrif of the Muntafiq and other influential persons are all of the opinion that Agab in honour bound must continue with this matter unless a peaceful solution is reached soon. This matter/matter they all say must be settled according to tribal custom, which I understand is also the wish of the Iraq and Kuwait Governments. When I ask these people what should be done, they and Agab say that the only way this matter can be quickly settled is for me to go to Kuwait preferably with two acceptable Muntafiq shaikhs and to offer Sabah the easy road to settle the matter by coming with me to Agab and asking his pardon. Agab says that he is quite prepared to forgive Sabah and to agree to cancel the condition of three years exile. It is however generally agreed that Sabah would be too frightened to go to Mutlag unless I accompanied him, because it is generally held that no Sadun would injure Sabah if I were with him. Though this might appear to be an easy way out of the difficulty these are unfortunately many currents and cross currents which affect the matter.A*, /?.£ i'll y ^ 1949 on the subject of the letter sent by Agab al Mutlaq as Saadun to His Majesty^ Consul, Amara, we wish to assure you that there was no proof, either rraterial or concrete to establish this allegation. But we, due to the traditional friendship existing between as Saadun and ourselves, and being very keen to naintain the interested friendsJj^p and good relations with, hastened immediately to get in touch indirectly with A. Beygal Falah, the chief of the Saadun family. At that time we began investigating into the case to fi nd out if the allegation was true or not. It has become clear to us by a concrete proof that Hejab had opponents who were doing the same work he used to do., i.e., illegal work such as smuggling etc., and these opponents murdered Hejab and spread rumours in order to cover their crime. To prove this fact, we are enclosing for your information a copy of the statement given by * an Arab or Iraq named Helayal bin Amash, who witnessed the incident personally. We wish to thank His Majesty*s Ambassador for the interest he takes in our affairs and in the meantime we wish to t v ank His Excellency the Political Resident for his great interest in his friend's affairs. As to the threat by Agab and his intention to do something we leave that to your intelligence.TRANSLATION OF STATEMENT MADE BY HELAYEL BIN AMASH. I met Awad al Mutlaq in Zubair and asked him to give me a donkey because my donkeys had died. He said, 'come to our place and we shall give you. I shall give you one and my brother will give you one too.' I went to them on the next day and had some coffee at their place at Dhuheirat Urn Derra and before sunset, they put on their arms and went out. They were four men, i.e., Awad, Auda, Hamad and Mohsin. I followed them, but Awad asked me to return and leave them alone. I returned, but again I followed them and could see them, but they could not see me. When they came to the car, Awad fired and killed Hejab and his companions. When they left I went to the murdered person and I recognized him fully well. I then returned to then and Awad said 'Oh Helayel, conceal what you have seen. Habbour our crime. We have bren deceived by the devil and have murdered the men.' They instructed teir wives and moved their camp that night. I then l^ft, but at that time I had instructed Faleh bin Hamal and told him that the blood of Bin Saadun is not on (with) Subah but on al-Shereifat, Awad and his brothers.

Shaikh Agah al imtlaq. al Saadun called here yesterday and talked at length aTx&gt;ut murder of his Brother. He said he was not interested in Shaikh of Kuwait’s offer of ex gratia payment of Rs.4000 or 5,000 or any other cash offer. It was not question of money But of Saadun honour. Unless honouraUle settlement was reached Blood would lie Between ^ SUB AH and SAADUN houses and although for various reasons he did not propose to avail himself of his right to take retributive action now, other Saaduns might Be less patient and there would always Be possiBility of violence. 5. Suggestions for settlement were (1) appointment of Single arBitrator (who would have to Be a person of some standing in the AraB world) in whom Both parties had confidence and whose decision they would Bind themselves to accept, or (2) some personage like King IBn Saud or King ABdullah or the Begent of Iraq' should Be moved to 'order' the Saaduns to forgive and forget. In this way &amp; the Saadun # s honour would Be saved Because they could always quote this 'order' as good and sufficient reason for not exacting retribution. 4. AgaB al Mutlaq though quiet and reasonable was obviously still very sore about the Business and gave me the impression that he will never settle down unless some face-Saving Solution is found.

The family may still stick to their principles about blood money; but we think it is better to let this offer be made before we consider any other solution* We are sending copies of this letter to the Consul-General at Basra and the Political Arrent at Kuwait* owv S -^^0 f His Excellency , K.C.I.E*, oident, Persian Gulf, BAKUKIN* 0.3*1*/y tc3 ' Telegran /C Repeated ■tfrom To Prodrome Baghdad V.
