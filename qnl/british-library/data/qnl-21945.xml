M 0 f Sir, ^ With reference to your despatch No.95 (16/23/39) of the 31st March regarding the position of the employees of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company in connection with the registration of British subjects for national service, I have to inform you that, after having consulted the interested departments of His majesty's Government, I am of the opinion that it is a matter of prime importance that no steps should be taken by the Company in the matter of releasing employees for national service which would in any way tend to impair the output of oil or restrict its availability to meet war-time requirements. 2. There should be no question of competition between the needs of the company and purely military or naval requirements Should there, however, he a surplus of staff over and above the company's needs, you may suggest to the company's representative that he might compile a register of such surplus employees (showing details and qualifications) who might be willing to take commissions or to enlist in the military or naval forces in time of war. The draft of a suitable form for use in connection with such a register is enclosed for your guidance. Prom the military aspect volunteers with a knowledge of motor transport driving, or H.J. Seymour, Esq., C.M.G., C.V.O., etc., etc., etc. Tehran. * !of vehicle and electric repair work, would be specially valuable. I would repeat, however, that it is in the highest degree undesirable that any withdrawal of staff should occur to such an extent as to interfere with output of oil. 3. In the event of an outbreak of hostilities occurring before any detailed arrangements have been made in the above sense, I shall be glad if you will suggest to the Company^ representative that he should communicate direct with the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Egypt, who is being instructed to arrange, in conjunction with the Naval and Air Force authorities, for the utilization in such circumstances, of the services of any volunteers. I am, with great truth and regard, &lt;jbc., (Sd) R.DUNBAR. (For the Secretary of State)% ENCLOSUW€ ! N ^Of?E!0N OFHCfe covrr^r: COPY# (T 4729/311/37^). No. 95.

Last eptem'rer it wee evident thr;t many o^ them ^elt uncrttin where their duty ley, i*e., whether they could beet serve their country by going home end enlisting or by continuing their existing occupations* The Kuropeen British male strength of the m orn oeny is over one thousand five hundred. Of this total more then half* are engaged on construction work of various classes? which, in the event of war, would have to be curtailed or stopped. If men were permitted to leave the Company Indiscriminately the output of oil might be impaired; and, eg ’ T r. Gardener has pointed out, confusion might result if large bodies of men went to Iraq clamouring for transport home. 2. I have taken advantage of the presence here of a London representative of the Anglo-Iranien Oil Company having previous experience of Khuzieten to c’iscnss the above matter with him and with the Company’s chief representative at Tehran. They agreed broadly with the position reported by Mr. Gardener, including the probability of the company The Right Honourable The iscount Halifax, K« 0. , . ft*X* , etc*, etc*, etc*, uhe foreign Office, 3. f.l. beingbeing able to diepenee by degrees with the men engaged upon new construction work:; but they ©tteched importance to the enployees (excluting, of course, Reservists) remaining at work until they could be released on e methodical plan, and they hoped that Hie Majesty 1 s fonsul woul use his influence in this dir&lt; ction* 9* The company* s represents t ive fi-om London was under the impression that some order of generel application in the above sense either existed or would shortly be published. If this is so, end if I h;ve overlooked some relevant in ication of the wish of His Majesty’* Government in this connexion, I would ask that I and His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwez should be apprised of it as soon as possible. In any case it would see'’ desirable that f r. Gardener should be informed as to what attitude he should adopt. 4« I am sending a cooy of this despatch to the Secretary to the Government of In ia in the external A^fei Department, and - 1 is ^F.jesty’s Consul at Ahwaa.

Similar consideration a rise at Bahrain. Please discuss with Company who might compile register of surplus employees if any.

No. Z/8-l.a/43 Will you please refer to your telegram No. T/123 dated the 21st July 1939 on the subject of compiling a register of surplus employees of the Bahrain Petroleum Company who might be willing and able to enlist in military or naval forces in time of war. 2. I was unable to discuss this matter with the Bahrain ^ Petroleum Company’s Managers before I left, but Hallows has since had a discussion with Lipp and Black. At the moment the Company have a comparatively small construction programme in hand which they are undertaking without any additional staff. (This includes construction of a number of extra tanks some of which might be required for the storage of aviation fuel in the event of war.) The work should be complete in November and the Managers think that thereafter they will have five or six men who might be spared for military or naval service without affecting the Company’s work. On the other hand, as you know, we are hoping that a local Defence Force /- The Honourable Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Trenchard Fowle, K.C.I.E., C.B.E., s Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, ^ Camp Shiraz.Force will be formed in Bahrain before many months have passed and I personally would prefer to see these five or six men ear marked for permanent duty with the Force in the event of war. And after all the Company really ought to have a small reserve to meet casualties by accident or sickness, and I know that as a result of recent re-organisation they are working with a bare minimum staff. It is, I suppose, arguable that some of the British personnel in Bahrain might be replaced by Americans from Hasa, but personally I would not recommend this since we may quite likely find that increased production in Hasa becomes of vital importance to us. 3. I may add, for your information, that I saw part of the External Affairs Department’s file in Simla on the subject of our Bahrain Defence Force and the permanent Army Adjutant and N.C.O. Staff Instructor whom we require. These two appointments have been approved in principle but the personnel could not be found in England, and India was asked if they could be supplied from there. An affirmative answer has been sent and there may therefore be deairable developments In the near future. Yours sincerely.CONFIDhMIIAIi * No.C/485-1.a/43.

All contacts made, and all necessary reports, will be passed through him to the controlling officer, Mr. Lipp. If or when instructions are received from the Political Agent that the Scheme must go into force there will be a permanent assignment of approximately 36 Europeans.AT© 2 This number will be elastic and can be increased or decreased for various duties other than their normal work. For example: condition will be issued by special notice to all employees to the effect that the Company, if considered necessary, will require of all employees twelve working hours per day; such hours being for either assisting in the defence scheme or the producing, refining and shipping of oils. uetll the Management consider such precaution ^necessary. according to the Controlling Officers f dec' Several executives of the Company would be appointed (1) To control and take care of all Food Supplies, rationing, including Liquor.

SECTION I - PRODUCTION^ OIL FIELDS &amp; SITKA PUMPING STATIOL . Controlling Officer - Mr. Colin Keith, for general supervision. Refer to attached map. All Wells that qre considered to be important are marked in red. All Tank Batteries are marked in blue. The three areas for special concentration are enclosed in large- 4 - circles. Telephone Lines will be checked from main points at Tank Batteries every half hour by the gate watchman telephoning through to the Central Exchange. The following will be assigned to this area:- Six Pickups , manned by One Driver, One European in Charge and two Natoors. One Truck , fitted with Vickers Egen Gun 10 Natoor Guards, two at each Tank Battery. ion. , 1 Nalk and 2 Natoors t for Sitra Pumping Station, All Wells of importance will be sandbagged and barbed-wired according to the decision of the Controlling Officer. The central point for the whole of this area will be Jebel Camp. There will be three sub-central points in the centre of the three areas marked on the map in large circles. The mobile force of six Pickups will be distributed as follows:- I Pickup assigned for each of the areas marked in a circle. The remaining three will inspect and traverse all roads outside these areas. The Cavalry Force will be divided into three, six in each group and divided between the three central areas. Their particular job will be to inspect those wells marked in red. Emergency telephones will be placed where quick contact can be made in cases of emergency. Europeans assigned for the duties stated above will be on eight hours permanent shift and can be used for otherthe duties after their patrol, etc*, has been carried out, the Defence Scheme claiming priority. Men on other duties can be brought into this area for one, two or three hours additional defence vrork if the Officer in Charge considers such procedure necessary, for it must be understood that the outline is essentially elastic. Men on duty will receive food and liquid nourishment brought to them by an officer appointed for the general camp for such duty. An individual scheme for patrolling of the cars, inspection and logging of wells will be worked out by the Officer in Charge co-operating with Mr. Crowhurst. It is believed that if this scheme is carried out efficiently it will minimise the possibility of sabotage to any wells that might impair the production of oil during the period of hostilities. The Officer in Charge will have three Assistant Officers on eight hour shift, who will carry out his instructions, inspecting and making spot checks in different parts of the Field during the 24 hours.

The Headquarters for refinery movement will beThree Class I Employees on eight hour shifts will be at the Refinery Gate. No unauthorised persons will be permitted to enter. They will see that cars are searched, but not Class I Employees - Class II and III only. Parcels or packages left at the gate for delivery to any particular unit must not be despatched without contacting one of the Officers in Command. Parcels must be held at the gate pending his instructions. This is an important point, for it would be by this method that one of the simplest of sabotages could be carried out. REFINERY GATE. One Havildar, three Naiks, six Policemen and three Coolie Gate Openers will be assigned. All other gates to the Refinery will be locked by the sentry on duty and not opened without the authority of the Commanding Officers of these areas.

The Political Agent asks for an authoritative statement from His Majesty’s Government for the guidance of the British personnel of the Company, and requests immediate authority for the creation of a local volunteer defence force. 2. With regard to the first of these two issues the question has already been considered with reference to the British employees of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (Foreign Office despatch to Tehran, No.162, dated 6th June 311/378) and of the Anglo-Ecuadorian Oilfields and ^ Ecuador Oilfields (enclosures to Foreign Office letter of the 8th June, No.T 6845/311/378) and on the basis of that H.L. Baggallay, Esq., Foreign Office, S.W.l. correspondence/(S) 2 . oorrespondence we would propose, if trie other departments concerned concur, to instruct the Political Resident on the following lines - “You are authorised to inform British employees of the Bahrein Petroleum Company that His Majesty’s Government attach the highest importance to ensuring in war-time the uninterrupted maintenance of the available sources of oil, particularly in territories under British influence or control, and are therefore most anxious that there should he no interference with the output of Bahrein oil, even though they should not he drawing upon this source of supply at the moment.

His/His Majesty’s Government have already given evidence of their attitude in this matter by arranging the release of two British employees of the Company (Messrs. Black &amp; Cotsell) from their obligations as naval reservists”. The reference in this last sentence is to action recently taken by the Admiralty* We should be glad to learn very urgently if you concur. 3* The matter of the Bahrein defence force is primarily for the Air Ministry as the Department responsible (through the ^ir Officer Commanding, Iraq.) for defence measures in the Gulf. The creation of a local volunteer defence force was recommended in paragraphs 14f. of the Bahrein Defence Appreciation and supported by the Oversea Defence Committee (see paragraph 6 of Oversea Defence Committee minute No.344, dated the 14th June). An essential part of the scheme was the provision of a Regular Army Adjutant and a Non-Commissioned Officer Permanent Staff Instructor, and the Government of India have stated that they can provide this staff subject to the cost being met by His Majesty’s Government. We do not know whether any instructions in this matter have yet been sent to the Air Officer Commanding, Iraq., but v/e suggest that it is desirable that there should be no further/(Sgd.) J.

The tele gram to which he refers was merely a reminder relating to his earlier telegram of the 7th September about the desire of British employees of the Bahrein Oil Company to be released for the purpose of joining Hi s Majesty^ armed forces, and about the early formation $'fthe proposed Defence For«c for the protection of the oil instalietions• 2- The Utter of 26th Kay 1936 to which Prior refers enclosed a copy of a memorandum by the Oil Bo*rd refer ring to their meeting of the llth April, 1938, in which, while endorsing the Petroleum Department's view of the importance of Bahrein as a source of oil supply, they gave their opinion of the relative importance of Trinidad, Rangoon and Bahrein in this connexion end put Bahrein third in the order of priority of these three sources of oil cupply. Prior also refers to a Committee of Imperial Defence paper containing a report by the Chiefs of Staff Sub Committee on a defence scheme for Bahrein. The relevant extracts are «We note that the Oil Board have now assessed Bahrein as being less important as a source of oil supply than Rangoon or Trinidad, and we-able for commercial purposes Moreover, the oil i rom the Bahrein oilfields has too high a eujLjghur content to be used in His Majesty^ ships except in an emergency, and all supplies are normally provided from Abadan. M 4* In replying to the Resident’s telegram about the British employees of the Oil Company we authorised him (after consultation with the interested Departments here) to inform them that M His Majesty’s Government attach the highest importance to ensuring in war-time the uninterrupted maintenance of the available sources of oil, particularly in territciiee under British influence or control, and are therefore most anxious that there should be no interference with the output of Bahrein oil, even though they should net be drawing upon this source of supply at the moment”. We assume the position to be that, even though the products of the Bahrein refinery are at present unsuitable for Royal Air Force use and though the Navy prefer less odorous oil if it is available, Bahrein is nevertheless regarded by Hie Majesty’s Government as of considerable (potential) import ance as a reserve source of supply, with the corollary that His Majesty’s Government think it essential that the oil installation should continue to function efficiently and should be protected against damage by sabotage or otherwise. Do you agree, end is there anything further that need be said for Prior’s guidance? 5. I am sending a copy of this letter to Jarrett. Yours sincerely, Sd.J.P.
