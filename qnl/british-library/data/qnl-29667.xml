Walters and Appleby told me he was accommodated in the Oil Company's Rest House and that he dined with them there. He talked at great length about the British economic situation and was much opposed to the grant of a further American loan. If you have any further information of this kind please telegraph it.To: His Majesty's Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations, LONDON Sir, With reference to correspondence ending with your t elegram No.12215 dated the &gt; 7th October, 1947 , on the subject of the Middle East congressional tour I have the honour to state that Mrs. Bolton and Mr. Merrow did not visit Bahrain presumably on account of the quarantine restrictions imposed by the Saudi Arabian Government. They did however pay a brief visit to Kuwait and I forward herewith a copy of a note which the Political Agent has recorded on the subject. So far as the Political Agent has been able to ascertain Mrs. Bolton and Mr. Merrow did not discuss politics during their visit nor make any reference to the British position in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedient servant, Political Resident, Persian Gulf. S it, Persia 'LB'WU i r di \) v. : i n Note on the visit to Kuwait of Mrs. Bolton and Mr. Merrow Mrs. Bolton and Mr. Merrow arrived by air from Dhahran about noon on the 20th and went to the Oil Company rest house where they were entertained to lunch. They called on the Political Agent at 3-30 in the afternoon a accompanied by Messrs. Moose and Chase. Mrs. Bolton was very charming, but Mr. Merrow found it necessary to make notes during the call - apparently about the interior decoration of the drawing-room. 2. The Political Agent took the party to call on the Shaikh at 4.00 p.m., where the conversation was largely between him and Mrs. Bolton. His Highness praised every thing American so fulsomely that he felt he had to apologise to the Political Agent afterwards and explain that he had not really meant it. 3. The visitors had tea at the American Mission and later a dinner party was given by the Oil Company to which the Shaikh, £he Political Agent and Mrs. Tandy were invited. 4. On the 21st the party were takep round the bazaar ^ and shown th e new Secondary School for boys and the girls school. They left before lunch by air for Tehran. Sd/- M.P.

Visit of Congressmen to Palestine. Application for visas for short stop over in Palestine and Transjordan on their way to Persia has been received on behalf of Senators Guy Cordon (R.

America October 8th and Green is already in London, 2, Senators are members of Senate Appropriations Committee which is engaged during Senate recess in in vestigating United States expenditure abroad. They will no doubt be interested in general question of United States aid to foreign countries ana in cost of United States Missions abroad. They may also now be concerned with possible cost to the United States Government if it has to take some share in administration of Palestine should British administration and forces be withdrawn in the near future. 3. We are asking State Department to request United States Embassy in London to make application for Green but would be glad to know if possible by October 7th whether visas may be granted to the other two. Please repeat your reply to Passport Control Office New York as they are going to New York October 4th before sailing. 4. Nothing adverse is known about these people, though press reports that Green [? gp. omitted ? and] other members of Rhode Island Congressional Delegation recently wrote to President requesting United States supporter a 'real Jewish National Home”, This need not be taken too seriously. ccccccFILE w 'U r' .

You will see that in the course of their tour they v/ill be visiting Kuweit. Mrs. Bolton and Mr. Merrow called at the Foreign Office on their way through London and we found them both well informed about Middle East affairs and also 'well disposed.
