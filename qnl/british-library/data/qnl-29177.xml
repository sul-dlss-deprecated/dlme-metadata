DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE KH/WATER ANL THIl^SHARGEYEEN. -^1 f 'l 1. Reference paragraph 45 of my diary No.6 of 1935. AST On 15th, news reached me that Ahmaa bin Rashid, Ruler of Umm-eA- Qaiwain, was preparea to effect a compromise between the Shargeyeen ana the Khwater or to arrange a truce for a perioa of one year. He sent a messenger to both parties informing them of his object, andand that he would go out to the desert, send for the cniefs of the two tribes and effect a compromise between them. If they did not agree to the compromise, he would arrange a truce for the said period. Both parties accordingly accepted the proposal and awaited his arrival at the place fixed. After two days he askea the Shargeyeen and the Khawater to come to his village 'Fali-al-Mualla' where his gardens are, situated outside Umm-el-.aiwain. Both partiei agreed to this also. Later, he again sent a messenger to the two tribes asking them to come to the town of Umm-el-Qaiwain. The Khawater agreed but the Shargeyeen refused to come. They informed the Shaikh that he had no intention of effecting a compromise between them as, they say, he knew they would have to leave their native place the roads of which were known to them, and come to Umm-el-^aiwain, his place. They further said to the Shaikh, ’’Should we not arrive at any settlement with the Khawater and no truce is arranged and we want to leave Umm-el-. t aiwain, then you will not be able to protect us. \\e do not know the roans nor the places in which we can be safe. would then oe victims under the guns of the Khawater. 2.

The master became known to both parties. The Khawater desired to return the camels of the Ghaflah and get back tneir camels irom the Ghailah. The Ghaflah bedouins did not agree to this. They will only agree on condition that they obtain revenge for the aggression done (to them). Consequently trouble again arose between them and they prepared for fighting. The Shaikh of itjman heard of this affair ana at once went to them with some of his fidawis. He made a compromise between them to the effectthat the looted camels shoulu he returnee to their respective owners ane no aemana should be made as regards the aggression done to the Ghallah by the Awamir. a 11 of them agreed to this after which the Ruler of Ajman returned. 67.

The Kuler, on hearing the event, produced the parties, gave them a good thrashing and put them in jail for three days. Later he released them and warned them that they should not use arms against each ^ othe next time. This act of the shaikh put fright in the heart ^ of the people. 2. Djbai.

It is reported that the iia’im tribe at Braimi revolted against their two Shaikhs Muhammad and Safar sons of Salman bin i^hammad. Their contention was that Imhasmad should rule the Braimi regions v/hich concern them. If luhammad did not agree then S a far should do so, that they should not divide it into two parts as at present and each of them rules half of the subjects with liberty and independence without peying any attention to the other brother. This is an act which will not do. It is also reported that the delay of Shaikh Rashid bin Hum aid in Braimi was due to a request made by the Na*im Shaikhs from him to intervene and settle the troubles which occurred between them and their subjects in a satisfactory manner. 2 . 19-4-36. It is reported that some fishermen came from Bokha to village Sha f am for the purpose of catching fish there. At night time they used to haul their boats on the land and sleep near them. One of the days a boat was not hauled on the usaul place.; The villagers saw it and took it to the sea. The owners of the boats became angry. At first there was just a talk between them and consequently they used their arms. One of the Sha’am inhabitants was killed and the two parties separated by the approach of dark. The people of Bokha ran away in their boats. 3. 23-4-36. It is reported that a slave of V/adi al Hulu, a dependency of Sharjah, while firing his rifle in the desert hit a camel and killed it unintentionally. He went and took refhge with the Headman of the village called Isa bin al Saiyid, but the latter did not give him a shelter. When the slave went out Isa^ father in law, the owner of the camel, came in and asked Isa to hand the slave over to him. Isa said that he turned the slave and that he was not with him. His father in law's reply l i X ( away H* was that.VVJLJ.JL ne snould hand over the slave failing which •Vhen Isa heard this he arranged his rifle and levelled it towards his father in law's chest. The latter also did the same and both of them fired. The bullets having been damaged did not get out of the rifles. Then each of them drew his dagger. Isa ran away to the desert but his father in law did not leave him. H e overtooi and killed him. ,/hen Isa's son saw this from his uncle he fired ' on him and killed him. When his cousin saw that his father was killed he killed the hoy and ran away. 76# DIVING / UP PEARL 1.

A.C With reference to your letter No.153-3/9, dated 14th April 1936, I beg to state that this incident took place in the desert far away from Sharjah. It is not possible that these disturbances would threaten the safety of the lives and properties of British subjects residing at Sharj ah. The Shaikh of Sharjah and other Trucial Shaikhs have no hands in such happenings, but the Bedouins themselves are concerned. Should one of the Rulers take any measure for preventing such incidents and the Bedouin robbers come to knov/ about it, they will not take it as a defence for himself (the Shaikh) but would think that by doing so he intends to fight with them. The Shaikh would then be put into trouble on account of plunders etc. being committed in his town.No, c ~- of 1355 Office of the adviser to the Government, Bahrain Dated 26th 3afar. 1355 May 18, 193b, H.B.M’s Political ^gent, Bahrain, Memorandum: - 'A^jOAL /\q , ; V - —-T 4 ' - .

Y/ith regard to the question of the jurisdiction of the Shaikh of Dubai over Bahrain subjects. In Bah rain under the Order in Council 'Trucial Coastis'* come under the Political Agent as British protected persons (see paragraph 2 A of my demi-official letter Bo. 116-3 dated the 13th February 1936 to Mr. Clauson, copy for warded to Colonel Loch under Residency Printed Letter No. 117-3 of same date). There being no Trucial Coast Order in Council, however, legally a Trucial Coast Shaikh has jurisdiction over all individuals in his State, whether these are his own subjects or not. This being so, the Shaikh of Dubai was correct in committing and punishing Jasim: the severity of the punishment is of course another question.% 4. It follows, of course, from the above that Kuwaiti and huscati subjects are also subject to the jurisdiction of any Trucial Coast ohaikh in whose territory they happen to be, and that “Trucial Coastis' themselves are similarly subject to the jurisdiction of any other Trucial Coast ohaikh when they are in his territory. When and if we have an Order in Council for the Trucial Coast, which will be administered (I suppose) by the Political Agent and Assistant Political Agent, Bahrain, for serious cases, and by the Residency Agent for minor ones, we will have to be careful tha, we do not make ourselves responsible for settling by law . the inter-tribal quarrels between the Trucial Coast Shaikhs. (This point does not arise in the other three areas already covered by Orders in Council: Muscat, Bahrain or Kuwait, or the fourth Catar, where it is pro posed to apply an urder in Council, as these otates are not contiguous to other States under our protection). That is to say that after the introduction of the Order, the 'Trucial Coastis' should be allowed to settle their feuds as at present, without our interference, provided that any fighting which takes place does not endanger the lives and property of British subjects, or the safe ty of the aerodromes and other air facilities. This object can be achieved on the lines of the Kuwait Order in Council where the Shaikh has jurisdiction over the subjects of foreign loslem Powers, * .Foreign Moslem Powders' being taken as including other Arab States of the G-ulf. In the Trucial Coast Order in Council this point could be more specifically defined. 5 /- / m5. With regard to the position of British subjects (who are all British Indians) referred to in paragraph 4 of your letter* Juch individuals are not punished according to Indian Law, as you suggest, since there being no Order in Council the only law existing is that of the Shaikh. If an Indian committed a crime 1 really do not know what action could be taken against him by us beyond deporting him from the Trucial Coast at the Shaikh’s request, though we have no legal sanc tion even for this. Theoretically the Shaikh could take action against the Indian, but this would be most undesirable, and 1 believe that the Shaikhs are under * the wholesome impression that they cannot touch British subjects, though they may deal with the British protect ed subjects of other Arab States in the Gulf, as the Shaikh of Dubai has done in this case. As far as I know no British Indian subjects have ever been punished by Trucial Coast Shaikhs. In 1918, however, (see Chapter IX of the rersian Gulf Administration Deport for that year) the Shaikh of Ajman was forced by the Resident to compensate a Persian whom he had flogged, and to pay a fine of As. 3000/- 6 . i will discuss the question of c'asim bin Mohammad, and the other cognate questions raised by this case with Colonel Loch when I meet him at Bahrain.

Dated the 22nd July 1936. To The Political Agent, Bahrain. Subject : Jurisdiction in respect of offences committed on the Trucial Coast. /- •&gt;&gt;V&gt; Memorandum. In the case of Jasim bin Muhammad himself, which we have discussed, I do not see that any action can be taken. The question of an unjust conviction has not been raised and this being so, as pointed out at the end of paragraph 5 of my Memorandum XKkkaxZh0.1395 of the 5th July 1936, the Shaikh of Dibai was correct in convicting and punishing Jasira, though doubtless according to our ideas the punishment was severe. At the same time one must remember that the Trucial Coast Shaikhs have no organized police, that the construction of the local houses and huts makes thieving and pilfering very easy, and that when a thief is caught local public opinion therefore fully concurs in an example being made of a confirmed thief such as un doubtedly Jasim appears to be. I understand th£ the Bahrain Government are unlikely to press the case. 2. Reference paragraph 5 of my Memorandum No.1395 of 5th July 1936, in which I said that if a British Indian subject commitfed a crime on the Trucial Coast it was doubtful as to whether we could deal with him. On second thoughts, hov/ever, under Section 4 (l) of the I.P.C. and Section 186 of the Criminal Procedure Code, such British subject could be tried at any place within British India at which he is 'found', if the act committed by him constituted an offence punishable under /under the Indian Penal Code. As the IndiaiPenal Code and the Criminal Procedure have been applied in Bahrain 1 imagine that such British Indian subject who is ’’'ffound * 1 in Bahrain could be tried there for such an act ? The Sections quoted in paragraph 2 above do not confer 4. jurisdiction in British India over foreigners committing offencesyi in foreign territory. On the other hand, since foreigners in H Bahrain, like British Indian subjects, fall under the juris diction of the Political Agent, and have applied to them the Indian Penal 0 o de and the Criminal Procedure Code, it might be argued that their position in regard to offences committed by them in foreign territory, is similar to that of British Indian subjects 'found' in Bahrain. 5. Whether if 'found' in British India a foreigner, Uj referred to in paragraph 4 above, could be arrested and sent to Bahrain for trial appears to be doubtful. above. 6 .

To The Honourable tne Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Busnire. fir, 1 / I nave the honour to refer to your letter No.c/90 of 1936 dated the 22nd July 1936, para 2. I afrree that British Inuian subjects committing offences punishable under the Indian Penal Coae outsiue British India are liable to be tried fur the said offences if found within the jurisdiction of the courts constituted under the Bahrain Order in Council. Further in ay opinion 'found'* does not necessarily mean accidentally found ana could be reasonably applied to tne case of an accused person who naving been sent on board one of His Majesty’s ships under guard by a Trucial Chaikh t*iiar : ;ea with an oflence punishable under the Indian Penal Code and committed within the Shaikh’s domain is brought to Banmin and tnus within the limits of the Banrain Order in Council ana the acts applied to Bahrain by the Bahrain Order in Council i.e. the Indian Penal Cone and Criminal Procedure Code. He coula be said to be 'found* 1 within the jurisdiction of tne Court administering the law of Inaia which prescribes for the trialJ trial and punishment of British Inoians committing offences punishable under the Indian Penal Code in places where tbe law of maia does not run. 2. V.'itk reference to para live of your letter quo tea above. I co not consider that the contention put fon/ard is correct. The law of India only applies to foreign subjects when they are in inuia and similarly the law of India only applies to foreign subjects here while they ere within the jurisdiction of the Courts administering the Indian Penal Code. They art not subject to the Indian Penal Code outside tne limits of 3ahr&amp;in. No forei ner is punishable in India for an offence committed within the limits of a foreign htatc. The foreign State has the ri ;ht to as*for extradition ana try the individual for the crime committee within its territory, iihether extradition is granted depends on a number of factors . . _ Scv' f88 /-* L 7 e ' which do not concern us. Please see note 3,, ptHpa 413 of the 12th edition of 3ohoni f s Code of Criminal Procedure 1927 Bombay. 3. If my reasoning is aece ted it is clear that we have no machinery to deal uui foreigners committing offences on the Trucial Coast, ana r.e have no machinery for dealing with British subjects couniiting offences on the Trucial Coast for Section 4(2) of the Indian Penal Code coniines their liability to offences committed within the ” territories of any Native Prince or Chief in India in addition of course to tne terri tories specified in Section 1 of Indian Penal Code. Presumably this is because a British subject is liable to trial and punishment under the law of England for offences committed in foreign countries whxch coula be defined as offences punishable unaer the law in force in England. Therefore .ve have tv/o important classes of / persons® »7 ^i) persons with whom we are powerless to deal. I think it advisable to continue the practice ol allowing the Trucial Snaticks to deal ith oruinar/ malefactors but for political reasons it is essential that we should be able to exercise control over the punishment of British subjects ana foreigners, particularly Europeans. It appears to me that a special Oraer in council will be necessary for the Trucial Coast which for the time being could be administered by the Political Agent, Bahrain and then only in exceptional circumstances. This would probably require the agreement of tne Trucial Shaikhs and possibly e suitable tifAe to approacn them would be a meeting of the Cnaikhs during the coming- winter. An alteration in or insertion of a new clause in the existing treaties would be necessary. I nave cue honour to be, hir, four most obedient servant, Captain, Offg.

After Compliments. I beg to state for your information as follows:- That in the midnight of 27th July 1S36 one of the guards of the Rest House at Sharjah called 3a-ad bin i^jid saw 2 men goirg to Sharjah from a distance of about 150 yards north-east of the servants quarters situated in the east of the Rest ^ouse. He shouted out to them but as they did not answer him he followed them. When he came near them he found that they were Ali Shah and Santlal, -ndian Rest House servants. He returned to report to the Head Guard with a view to inform the superintendent of the Rest House of the case. Thereupon they returned and pursued the gaard. Ali Shah came forward and caught hold of his left arm and hit him with his torch on the nose and wounded it. Then they jointly hit him on the head and bacu. The guard alleges that when he was hit on the nose he threw away his rifle and shouted loudly for the help of the Head Guard who came and found him lying on the ground while the two servants returned to the Rest House. At 4 ’ the Head Suard reported the matter to the Superintendent of the Rest Hondo Tv, +v. est nouse. In the morning he (Head Guard) went to the Hiler of Sharjah and infomed him of the ease. The latter detailed his man Abdullah bin Paris tonenquire the ca^e. Hg called on tne Superintendent of the Rest House and enquiries made by them show that Ali Shah was in fault. The Superintendent arranged with Abdullah bin Paris that Ali Shah would go to the Haler of Sharjah and apologize for what happened. oer this was done the Superintendent of the Rest House called on me and informed me of what happened. And as arranged he called on the Haler of Sharjah in the evening and apologized i or the failt committed by the Rest House servant and promised that he would punish him a c- ' - ‘ lla - ihe Sha ikh left the settlement of the case to him.Ali Shah and Santlal admitted that they were outside the Rest House. Ali Shah alleges that he went out with Santlal in order to ease himself and subsequently fax he alone went for a stroll. That the guard quarrelled with him charged £im of having come from Sharjah and hit him with the buot oi his rifle. Thereupon he hit him with his torch. But Santlal alleges that while he was standing in the hut of Walayat Khan from whome he obtained a matches to lit his cigarettes he heard the guard shouting to Ali Shall. Afterwards he grappled with him and he (the guard) hit Ali Shah with the butt of his rifle and the latter in turn hit him with his torch. Walayat Khan stated that he was asleep, did not give a matches to Santlal and did not see him in his hut on that night. In view of Ali Snail’s misconduct and the repeated complaints made against him it was decided by the Superintendent of the Rest House to dismiss Ali Shah from service and repapriate him to India. The Superintendent satisfied himself by v/arning Santlal and the case was tins settled. Usual Ending.I , .6^ fP’ri^K \ '• ^.l^J'A^r.US.V. 4r f\. ' . .

Shots were exchanged between him and them and he ran towards the tower. ..hen his companions heard the resound of the shots two of them descended from the tower and started firing on the bedouins who ran away and never returned. On 3rd October 1936 a man of Dafnah, which is under Shaikh S a id bin H a mad Chief of K a lba, was coming to Sharjah accompanied by his son. when he was in the fore part of the wilderness of Sharjah he was attacked by four of the A w amir./ three from A1 Hash id party and one from Al M a hram i and his camel,, two rifles and l u bbng es taken away. The aggrieved party went and complained to Shaikh Sultan - bin S a qar who sent his men in their pursuit but could not trace any of them. As there is a treaty between Shaikh Sultan bin S a qar, Ruler of Sharjah, and Al R a shid party for non-transgress!or .wrote to Shaikh K a lfut, Chief of Al R a shid rom tribe asking him to return what were taken away/ within his boundary. / On ISth October 193'' the liuta’arridh accompanied by 13 of the Awamir attacked a flock of camels in the wilderness of Dubai and took away 15 camels some of which belonged to Shaikh Hashar bin M a ktum, brother of the Ruler of bubai. She appointment of Shaikh Said bin Buti bin Sohail by the Ruler of Dubai (vide paragraph 16 of. Irucial Oman Hews for the year 1936) as. Amir, of Dairah and responsible for/its pi otection was tne cause of some grudge towards nim by his cousins Shaikh Mani’a bin Rashid and his brothers, Hashar, Said and L^ktum. They started ^exposing his faults -and criticising nio deeds very bitterly, -hey were not satisfied v/ith this but tried to put some obstacles in his way hence instructed their servants to go out at night and if opposed by S a id bin Buti's men ' one/ should seat Lhem and do not care for any one oven for the Ruler of Dubai hi self. On fne night of 3rd October 1336 Shaikh Hashar bin Rashid ordered his son Buti to go out and wait for 5&gt; a id and if he (Said) interferred ^ in on him he should hit him with arm and care not for any one. Shaikh S a id bin Buti reported nis ^case to the Ruler of Dubai. 3nt having j-ond oi peace, the Ruler of Dubai y told him not r ?' a k la ^ e but le,2 ' vc alone. The leniencv Ox ohe Ruler of Dubai in case of his cousin ' continue their activity and Buti bin oha-u.n Hashar was passing at night with some sf-iH S ! e rY ants threatening Shaikh du bin out! and ms men. then the matter reached this extent the notables of Bani Y„ s learea ox the occurrence of unpleasant incidents. /1 i ' \ 5. ^hey asked 3hai':h 3 a id to put a limit to such interference which is unjustifiable, fhe Huler of Aubai sent for headmen of his subjects and his cousins among i/hom were Shaikh Mani' a bin H a shid and convened a meeting on Wednesday 14th October IS36. I1 e explained the situation and the complaint of Shaikh Said bin Buti to them and asked them to select another person in his place if there is any justification in dismissing him from service otherwise -they should not interfere with his duty. N 0 final decision was passed on that day. Another meeting was convened the next day and Said bin Buti was called there. They could not find any cause for his dismissal but Shaikh Mani 1 a and his brothers asked that they should have distinction to others and that Shaikh Said bin -ngi shouldypass any orders against their sailors or detain any of them whatever his crime may be, but should inform the Ruler of Dubai about it and the latter himselx should hake the necessary action. After negotiation it was decided that people should be prevented from wandering about in the town at night after four o’clock Arabic with the exception of the Shaikh’s cousins an^ other well known persons and that Shaikh Said bin Buti will have no authority on any of the followers or sailors of the cousins °j- the Ruler of Dubai and he will not detain any of them. Then the meeting wan over and a crier notified prevention of walking abaut at night. It is reported that the cause for all these troubles on the part of R a shid’s sons, Shaikh’s cousins, was to frighten the Ruler of Dubai whom they want to fix for them one third of the income of Dubai and that if they did not succeed by this means they would complain to the Honourable the Political Resident m the Persian Gglf so that he may urge on the Ruler of Dubai to fix monthly salary for them. °n iSth October 1936 Shaikh S a id bin kaktum, w.^.w. , Ruler of Dubai, sent as -a present H ca 2 le ls one to His Excellency Shaikh Sip Ramad, Ruler of Bahrain, and the other to Shaikh Abdullah bin is a. k* 6 • ^Thursday 3th October 1936 a certain individual of the wilderness of Mas afar ah trib- complamed to Shaikh Ahmad bin Rashid, R u ler ol u m m ul QaTwain that on his arrival by a ca . r ^: van dmm ul Qaiwain one of the mn-no o°ne of ht RaShi ? 0bst ™ cte&lt;5 ardbook one of his camels on the plea that he had ^ °- n account 0:r the cost ^ a ra.^ie. xne Shaiich got anrry and ao-n-f- for his cousin to find out about' th'is. /£ / V 4 As soon as he came the Shaikh drew his dagger aec. \/anted to stab his cousin Abdul Aziz/ the Bedouins who were present there came between him and his cousin aid did not allow aim bo stab his cousin. thereupon he ordered one of his servants to fire on him aid kill him. ■^he servant was also prevented from doing so. fhen the Shainh took oath that he would drive a.ay his coisin at once from Urnm ul Qaiwain. xnis v/as done at once, fhen he ordered that his house be closed down and his family be transferrpd to^the Shaikh| s house (because the wife of the said Abdul Aziz is uhe sister of Shaikh Ahmad oin H a snid ?

British Agency, Sharjah, 21st November 1936. RL To, The Political Agent, Bahrain* Memorandum. In continuation of my letter No.T/1. dated (Bahrain) the 5th November 1936, I beg to inform you that, according to the statement (copy attached) made by Muljimal Lalchand before the British Agency at Sharjah on 3rd November 1936 and further inquiries made by me after my arrival, the assailant was a lunatic by name Bakhut, slave of Nasir bin Rashid of Un-al-Qaiwain. 2. Muljimal b a lchand was slightly wounded by Bakhut with the point of the dagger on his right forearm. Immediately after the incident, Bakhut was arrested and put in chains by his master. Lalchand also suffered a loss of about Rs.300/- on account of the goods damaged by Bakhut and requested me -to recover the amount from Bakhut's master. Bakhut was a real lunatic and incapable of knowing the nature of the act committed by him. On the ground of unsoundness Bakhut was exonerated from liability and, therefore, I do not see my way to ask the Shaikh to recover the amount from the master of Bakhut. 3. Under the circumstances I do not propose taking action in the matter, and should be grateful to know if you approve that no action for the recovery of the' claim fVom Nasir bin Rashid should be taken*Statement mane by Muljimal nalcnana, Britisn suoject residing at Umm ii.1 ^aiwain, recoraea at Snarjan on tne 3rd November 1936 (13tn SnaDan 136b). On Sunaay the 1st November 1936 at 6 O’clock Arabic while 1 was sitting m my snop at Umm Ul ^aiwain, a man called Bakhut who is the slave of Nasir bin Rashid of Umm iil ^aiwain came in my snop and sat by me. 1 had heard that the said slave was insane. I askea him what he wanted and he replied saying that as I am a British subject he came to take refuge with me lest his master hasir kills him. I told him to go to tne Residency Agent at Sharjah, in the course of my conversation with the said slave a boy from Umm Ai Qaiwain named AOdur Rahman bin Yusuf whose age was not more than 20 years entered the shop and stood oy the slave Bakhut and asked him what was he doing tnere with me. had ne come to trouble me in my place. Abdur Ragman said that he wanted to take him out of the shop. The slave lifted his cloth and told Abdur Rahman that he had nothing but - this, ine slave overtook Abdur Rahman out side the shop to beat him , but Abdur Rahman fled away from him. The slave returned and entered my shop taking a dagger from f-rom one of the cup-boards in my snop wnicn was mortgaged to me by Sultan Al Maghrabi of Umm ^1 ^aiwain. he stabbed me slightly in my right fore arm. I ran away from him and went out of the shop, ly son Goodi was with me and ne also ran away from the shop and went out. I snouted ^or help from those who were standing around my shop. Abdur i^annan wno was one of those standing there ran and locked up the shop on the slave Bakhut who remained inside. I went to inform tne master oi the slave Nasir bin Rashid about the betas of his slave. When I arrived there ana informed him aoout what had happened, he put medicine on my fore arm and tolc me that his servant Bakhut was maa ana ne- 2 - was conl'inea in the goaown all tne time. But lor tne last lew days it appeared to him that ne was alrignt, so he released i him . any way he said that us was prepared to satisly me in any way 1 liked. But I left Nasir oin Rashid without giving him any reply and returnee, to mjy snop. 1 saw people crowded around tne suop, the slave was still in the shop ane ne locned the shop irom inside. 1 heard him scattering and breaking tne articles m the snop. In the meanwhile, the slave of Snaikh Ahmad bin Rashid, named Sarur accompanied by two guards passed and stood by those standing there, i asked them to open the shop arid bring out tne slave so thfclne might not spoil any of the goods of tne snop. Tney hesitated in opening the shop and when I was asking them to no so, Shaikh ^li bin Hamad, cousin of Snaikh ^iimad bin Rashid, Ruler of Umm ^1 Qaiwain, appeared and I informed him of the incident and about the slave inside the shop. He opened the shop, entered it.with the guards, arrested tne slave and handed nim over to tne guards to give him to his master Nasir bin ^mnao. I then entered the shop and there was- with me a crowd of people of Umm Al ^aiwain among whom were shaikh nil bin Hamad, cousin of the Ruer of Umm Al ^aiwain, ^bdur nahman bin Yusuf, Kumaid bin ^uitan, clerk of tne Ruler of Umm ^1 ^aiwain arid others. f We found the large mirror broken and all tne perfumes scattered such as Amber, Rusk arid otner scents. He poured oil on 2 pieces of silk cloth and destroyed 12 pages from my account book. Trie loss sustained by me on account of the above mentioned articles was estimated at Rs.300/-. I at once closed my snop ana proceeded to Snarjau in order to inform the Residency Agent of the incident. Sd/- Mooljimal nalchann.I IT ill :SiuQuestion A master knows that his slave is mad whom he released thinking that he was alright* The slave injures a man with his dagger and also damages his goods in the shop.
