As regards this point » I wo^ld observe that no aentlon of the n areen Line' has ever been v-aade either to the Shaikh of Koweit or to the Iraqi Oovemaent and that the latter will andoobtedly stand by the definition of the frontier to which it has already agreed if a new interpretation which is detriaental to its interests is proposed. I tntrn now to eonalder the iaiaedlate practical question of the port at I mm Qasr. thile the port const motion is aslnly being undertaken by Vnlted states contractors, Iraqi asaistanee in several directions - notably in dredging and bnoying - is indispeneable* The ijnpply of water is by pipe fro® Iraq; the port will be linked to the Iraqi railway ays tea; in genersl the whole nndertaking looks northwards* rather than eoitthwarde* Iraqi goodwill is thoa a aoat important factor In the snecessf^l operation of the port* As yon will be aware, the Iraqi Government have at different times had under considerstion the«eives the building of e port in this neighbourhood, and their helpfel ettitnde towards the present project is no donbt largely dfie to the expectation that at the end of the war they will scqnire one at little or no cost to theaaelves* It would, I consider, have a most unfortunate effect on their preeent ettitnde if His tea Majesty's Government were now to repudiate the definition of the / : frontier which they spontsneonsly snggested in 19U0 and, as it were, to award the whole or even a part of the dock area to Koveit* I accordingly snggest that, if it shonld be decided to abandon the 1924.0 formrla for one more favenrable to the Shaikh of Koweit, it woeld be preferable to await the end of the war before pressing a new definition an the Iraqi Oovemraent, in order that in the ooeantlme they may contlane to afford the cooperation which is required of theou As things are st preeent * and msre especially since a part of the new N town ,v of Dmm Qasr is eitedTTndispntably Koweltl territory - I do not consider that the Iraqi Ocvemment would deour to the whole area being administered by the British military anthorlties, as urged in the fonrth paragraph of my telegram So« 1 Tour of the 25th February; if this is done, it should be s simple rfcs ^ter to reetrict the place of eetablishment of any organ of the Iraqi Oovernment to territory which is indis putably Iraqi and thus avoid conipromlsing the eventual disposition of the doubtful territory* $ ' p .foO 6* The long-term effect on imperial interests of the eventual decision regarding the frontier can best be appraised by you. Sir, in consultation with the other intereated departments of Hia Majesty Oovemment* I would only here offer e few observations. It haa been suggested in Lieutenant Colonel Pribr^s telegram to the aecretery of State for India Ho« T/39U of the 3rd Aegnst, 19U1, that. If the port were to become Iraqi after the war, Koweit would be in '■mortal danger'* yrom my convereationa at Basra with hia auccessor and with the present Political Agent, Koweit, I underatand that the Shaikh feara rather the political than the economic conaeqnenees, though the Isttsr might be serioes /if theIf the trims It trade for Pfawdl Arabia were diverted from Koeelt to twm Qaer.

In the first place I must make it clear that not admit that' the definition of the frontier in article J^of the Anglo-Turkish agreement of 1913 is any less authoritative than the 1923/32 text. By this I do not mean that we wish to depart in any way from this latter text. I mean simply that, in view of .Sir Percy Cox's categorical statement that his definition of the frontier v/as, so far as it went, identical with that indicated by the Green Line of the Anglo-Turkish ^^greemerit, we consider that hoth definitions are of equal validity and that, where either may 'be ambiguous or obscure any evidence provided by the other must be taken into account. In other words we consider that the identity of intention of the 1923 definition with that, of 1913 must be regarded, not merely as a P. *^7 probability (see paragraph k of Gaccia's letter)'but as a certainty; and we should not be prepared to accept any arguments, such as those at the beginning of his paragraph 10, which imply that the latter text intentionally departed from the earlier one. (^s will be shewn below, this does not mean that 'the two definitions are in fact wholly consistent.) In paragraph 7 of the same letter it is contended that the. SheikhjDf Koweit cimnot base much argument on the 1913 definition because Sir Percy Cox,- when he made the statement mentioned above, told the Political xigent at Koweit that it seemed unnecessary to make special allusion to the 1913 agreement in his communication to the, Sheikh. This contention appears to us somewhat disingenuous, and it fails to take account of the essential fact that the Sheikh has entrusted his foreign' relations to 'and looks to them to safeguard his rights. It is therefore incumbent upon us, in any case .where there is a possibility of those rights being infringed, to take into account all the facts and not only those of which the Sheikh may happen to be aware. ^ ■, ^ ** Vfi T)- 'to, s.^, p.*** 7 3. Since, therefore^ we, maintain that the texts of 1913 and 1923 are of equal validity, we are* unable to accept for the most part your conclusions-with regard to the disputed points on the frontier. For example. Hay's definition of the eastern end of the line as running 'from the water's edge at the right bank of the Khqr-ath-Tha 1 alab ,r does not seem to us an 'excess of ingenuity' but a very reasonable interpretation of the passage in the 1913 text 'part de la cote a I'embouchure du Khor Zubair'. If, as you contend, the corresponding passage in Sir. Percy Cx^'s^ierinitioncanr^t refer to a pciat.-^n the bank, it does not follow that either text should be rejected in favour of the other; but that there is a discrepancy between the two which can only be resolved when the frontier is delimited. I should add here, that while we share liay's doubts regarding Wakefield's conclusions as to the nomenclature of the various waterways, we agree with him that if possible no pronouncement should be made now which will preclude the Koweit authorities from arguing on the same lines as Vakefield when t&amp;e time -f-or frontier demarcat 'i m' comes.

In paragraph 5 of his letter Caccia argues that this line is only of subsidiary importance, because lines on maps are always subordinate to the text in words. while we do not dispute this as a general rule, we do not altogether see how it is applicable to this particular case, since there is no suggestion of using the line on the map to prove anything at variance with the text. On the contrary, the- line which is referred to in the text, bears out what the text says, and we consider that it should be accepted as a valuable piece of evidence as to the alignment of the frontier at this important point. ; K;.: : -v 5.

The only definition jf the point just south of Safwan which seems to have won anything like general acceptance—is that it I'ies air the site of th former notice-board which, according to the Political Resident's telegram N o .T /380 of September 12th, 19U0,- stood about 1050 yards south of the most southerly, palm of Safwan. while therefore we agree that it may not be possible to accept Hay's suggestion that 'just south of Um Qasr' means not more than 100 yards from the fort, we equally do not see how the analogy of Safwan can be used to support the 1940 formula which according / to Cornwallis would bring the line as much as nearly two miles south of the fort. 6. It will be clear from the abovp that v/e are in full agreement with Hay's conclasion that the 1940 formula is tjo favourable to Iraqi. While we admit that tht. formula was not an offer but a statement of H.M. G's views as to the interpretation of certain points in the 1923/32 definition, we cannot agree that we are in any way precluded from revising our views if it can be shown that the decisions taken in 19U-0 were based on imperfect knowledge or inaccurate interpretation. Nor, in our opinion, is it wholly irrelevant that the Iraqi Government did not accept the 1940 proposals for frontier delimitation; at least-it will surely be conceded that th^ir' non-acceptance lias^ left H.M.G. in a freer position in relation to the formula than would otherwise be the case. Gornwallis agrees, in paragraph 2 of his despatch No, that legally speaking H .M .G. are not bound by the 1940 definition' and as shown below, we do not think it should be impossible to tell the Iraqis now that further consideration of the matter has given rise to some doubt in our minds as to the accuracy -of the inter pretations which the formula contains particularly as the Iraqis were informed of the Sheikh's acceptance of the fjrmula. rxS regards position of the Sheikh, a study of the letters which the Political at the time (copy forwarded to the Foreign Office/ //&gt; -. Si; - i kSLP* /KXA 3' Office .under our No, P. Z.U538/UO) 'bears out ^akef iel..' s contention that he accepted the formula on the assunption that it represented no more than a clarification of the existing definition. For this assumption we are responsible; if therefore it can be shown to 'be incorrect, we can no longer, as the guardians jf the Sheikh's rights, regard his acceptance as binding on him. //• »• o 7. It seems improbable from this correspondence' that agreement can be reached between us on this question and we ire therefore lisposed reluctantly to accept the view, on which both Cornwallis and. Hay are in agreement, that further discussion of the exact definition of the frontier line should be deferred till after the war, and that the administration of the whole port area should be left as an exclusively military one for the durati on of the war. In that case the only ^ question which need be decided while the war lasts is what should be the terms of the further communications to be male before the end of the war to the Iraqi Government and the Sheikh. Our provisional views are that (a) the Iraqi Government should be told that after the war it will be necessary, before deciding what is to be done with Um Qasr, to demarcate the frontier in the neighbourhood of the port; it would not be necessary for Gornwallis to tell them at this stago that the l^UO formula has been abandoned, unless they specifically put the question, in which case we feel that he would have t:» do so. You will remember that it was suggested in paragraph k of my letter No.Ext.6373/Ul of October 20th last, that something might also be said as to the intention of H. d, G. at the end of the war (or when the boundary question is settled) to concert with the Iraqi Government and with the Sheikh the necessary arrangements f jv the constitution of a ' . ' Joint Harbour Board to control the port. *€ unaurstand that the Foreign Office are not in favour jf this suggestion and we are now inclined to' agree that until a final demarcation of the frontier shows more clearly the extent of the Sheikh's interest in the port, it would be premature to raise this possibility. /f* (b) similar communication should be made to the Sheikh, who should also be t^ld thaJt^H.M. G. are unable to give him the promise for which he has asked, viz., that none of the port buildings should be handed over to the Irakis after the war. At the same time he should be assured once more that his rights will be fully safeguarded both now and in the post-war settlement. 8. The above represents our views on this question after full consideration of the issues involved and we feel that it is unlikely that the Political Resident will find it possible to modify the v iews [ _ ^ which he has already expressed in the matter.

It was ascertained that in 1922 96 per cent, of the shipping which crossed the Shati-el-Arab bar was British. The British shipping interests )fcere consulted, and it wae agreed that an Advisory Committee should be formed of commercial and shipping representatives to work in partnership with the ucvernment of India in the administration ol the new Lighting and Buoying Fund; the Ira% Government agreed to levy the dues, which Vrere put into force Jat the rate of 3 annas a ton, since reduced to li annas a ton) on the 1st November 1925. His laajesty^ Govern ment agreed to contribute £ 5,000 a year for five years, subject to review at the end of that period.

The notifleetion indeed was laaued in veapect of a port which, though long contemplated, by iir John Ward, waa actually only berun st the inat«noe of the British military authorities for the furtherance of the wsr effort, end the cooperation of the Iraqii Oovermaent regarding its use tftight ^e impaired if they auspected that it hsa been located in disputed territory for sotie imeginary and unspecified ulterior purpose. If t moreover, they sho%ild ^till be of the opinion that the dolimitation of the frontier wipht place the port in Koweit, their suspiclonn might be nore deeply sreused by our questioning am sdninistretive set which they had performed in good feitfc fey the achievement of an jUuuadiate and praotieal ob^«c%* I 3- 1 ahould therefore prefer to say nothing to the Iraqi rovemiaent st present on the sssumption, which I regard as remionable f that this notificstion will not, end csrmot effectively, be quoted in their favour as constituting (by paasing anehsl iged; s clsim to eoverelgnty over the territoiy to which it relatea.

Hie Highness might be disposed to invite the Iraqi Oovemcaent to confirm that the present notification had been made without prejudice to any ultimate dec i a ion regerding the d era erection of the frontier and that it was uiersly issued sa a matter of administrative convenience to permit the Plrecto*» e '1 of Porta to carry out functions necessary to iueet the requirenents of OH 1 T ffoul# then present this request on the shaikh*s behalf to the ?rime Minister and, feigning lnnoce :ice as to its origin, stress w trust thst he would see no difficulty in giving the assurance desired.

I trust, however, th^t he would concur in our wishes without arguing the point * unduly, 6. In paragraph 3 of hia Express letter the Political Resident draws attention to the point that the third paragraph^ of ttai notification la both unnecessary and also contrary to the prenriously agreed principle that the administration of the port should be the sole reanonalbility of the Britiah military authorities. It ■rill, however, be obaerved that in thia paragraph the words 'whore applicable' have been inserted, so as to provide for this very contingency, and I am now informed by Geneial Ueadguarteia, Peraia-Ireo CJommand. that the services naiued will, in fact, all be performed by their Command, co that the paragraph is already, as regards it a contents, a dead letter. General Headquartera furthermore state that the aervioea enumerated in paregraphc 1 and 2 can most conveniently be carried out by the Port and that the method of remuneration proposed thwrein ia equitable and preferable to other methods, all of which would require nufth detailed accounting; they may however wish to contend that the actual scale of dues, which are given as for Baera Port, should be modified in the ease of Utt Qaar, in view of the more restricted nature of the services perfonaed and of the facilities provided at the expense of Hie kejesty , s Oov^rmaont.

The Ambassador reassured him and it was agreed that their activities should be limited to pilotage, lighting and buoying. 'Conservancy* wnich can cover everything in the harbour world, was not mentioned. The harmful nature of such a notification must have been obvious and i cannot understand how it was agreed to without prior reference to the Government of India or this Residency. The Shaikh has never had any illusions about Ward (reference my telegram No.T/309 dated 31st March 1940 when he told me that his troubles were 'all from Ward') and both I and the late Senior Naval Officer - vide his signal No.0815 z dated 24th Farch 1940 (^ • ♦ • •) have always doubted the motives of the Port Director. 3. If military administration/ were to administer the port zone themselves why was Iraq Notification necessary? The references to Abadan and Bahrain are scarcely relevant since Iraa does not claim them. Persia is most 1 ^ careful toward the simplest notification so as to preserve her claim to Bahrain though they have had no jurisdiction for 150 years and yet when Iraq, legislated for a disputed / area ■- 2 - area we consider it 'little more than a f oruality' r , 4. Paragraph 4 of Baghdad letter 'begs the whole question. It has not 'been decided that port is in Iraq territory. If we are sincere in protecting Kuwait's interests we must act with the same intelligence and vigour that we should show if our own territory were at stake and 'be scrupulous hot to prejudice her interests in any way. 5. I feel it is scarcely reasonable to ask the Shaikh to act in the manner proposed nor I am afraid will he 'be impressed 'by a statement that his rights will 'be fully protected at some future date. I recommend that a 'brief note should 'be sent to the Iraa Grovernment nuoting the notification ''which was issued 'by Sir John Ward on 'behalf of the military authorities regarding Um Qasr'* and mentioning that paragraph 3 will no longer have any force as the military authorities are administering the port themselves. It should not 'be difficult to obtain an acknowledgement of this, 'but it would 'be most difficult to obtain an acknowledgement from them of the letter proposed 'by the Embassy and our position would be seriously weakened if none were obtained. 6. I agree that the words ''where applicable f in paragraph 3 of the Notification can have the meaning assigned to it by the Embassy letter; on the other hand it can equally easily have the meaning assigned to it by my predecessor. 7. I am not quite clear what is meant by para graph No. 7 but trust that Kuwait's interests will not be allowed to suffer. - 'BEITCONSUL -L 14) 9^ 53/87 Telegram From To ftepe ated No. 21280 S.

New Delhi Political Resident, at Bahrain Political Agent, Kuwait Dated 10th received 11th December 1942* Correspondence ending with Government of India telegram No. 9158 to Secretary of State for India. Since iby agreement between Iraq Government and . Shaikh of Kuwait) port area of Um Qasr is to tee administered for duration of war by British military authorities, paragraph 3 of Port Directors notification seems entirely inappropriate. So long as a request for its cancellation is put forward for this reason alone there seems no valid cause why Iraq Government should object, and I think that we must ask them to take this step since otherwise I fear Shaikhs rights in any part of port area would be prejudiced. 2. Paragraph 1 and paragraph 2 of notification seem: unobjectionable but I think it desirable that we should put it on record that fact that port of Basra authorities are by agreement performing certain services in approaches to Um Qasr and levying charges in respect of these services is without prejudice to rights of Shaikh. Ifaq Government cannot dispute fact that half of waterway leading at least part of way up to Um Qasr from sea is Kuwaiti so that for us to reserve Shaikh^ rights should not give rise to controversy. I presume in fact dues under paragraph 1 and paragrsph 2 will be levied when vessel reaches port of Um - and that they will be collected by military authorities and handed over to Port of Basra. Military authorities are considering whether they will levy dues for wharfage end wharf services to ship and cargo at Um Qasr. If they decide to do so they will presumably issue an appropriate noti ce. 4 /. I4. I shall be glad therefore if you will address to Iraq my Government a communication on the lines of^fimmediately succeeding telegram. 5« His Majesty^ Government are responsible for foreign relations of Kuwait and it will be clear from this communication that we are speaking on behalf of Shaikh. There seems to be no need for us to emphasise this point. We cannot of course dissociate outselves more from him in this matter. 6. You will see that proposed communication refers to Kuwaiti waters only and makes no reference to land frontier# It has in fact been designed to avoid arousing controversy regarding frontier end we would greatly prefer to leave open for time being question whether His Majesty Is Government should or should not adhere to 1940 formula or indeed if His Majesty^ Government can abandon it. further consideration could of course be given to this question at once if this proves necessary but we hope that it will not and that it will be sufficient if you take the line that some part of the area now administered by -British military authorities is likely to be found when frontier is delimited to be in K u wait. Should Iraq Government ask specifically whether His Majesty^ Government stand by 1940 formula you can only say that you must refer point to me for instructions. In the same ? wa.y Political Resident and Political Agent at Kuwait are being instructed to avoid giving Shaikh at this stage any reason for belief that His Majesty's Government do not stand by formula.

Dated 10th received 11th December 1942. Political Agent, Kuwait. No. 21283 Following is text referred to in my immediately /' /- preceding telegram. - &gt; Attention of His Majesty's Government has been drawn to notice No. 36 in Iraq Government Gazette No. 24 \ dated June 14th 1942 ?relati ng to port of Um Qasr and issued by Iraq Director General of Ports and Navigation. 2. Paragraph 3 of this notification prescribes charges to be levied on vessels in respect of their use of port of Um Qasr. This paragraph is not understood imutJ with agreement both of Iraq Government and of Shaikh of Kuwait, port area is to be administered for duration of war by British Military authorities and in fact the services for which charges are made in paragraph 3 are being performed not by Iraq Director General of Ports and Navigation but by British Military authorities who can issue their own scale of charges for use of port. It appears that paragraph 3 has been issued under a misapprehension and His Majesty's Embassy have been instructed to request that it may be cancelled. 3. In paragraph 1 and paragraph 2 of this notification a schedule of dues is fixed for vessels using waterways leading up to port of Um Qasr and dues for pilotage are also laid down. In these waters which are partly Iraqi and partly Kuwaiti, Iraq Director General of Ports and Navigation are by agreement performing services above dredging /-—- 2 - L&gt; dredging lighting and buoying and it is also agreed that they are entitled to levy charges in respect of services so rendered. No objection is in consequence taken to paragraph 1 and paragraph 2 of this notification but it is of course understood that performance of these services during war in no way prejudices rights of Shaikh of Kuwait in that portion of waters which belongs to Kuwait.i s(w Prodrome, Bagdad.

Saving. 7 Your telegram No.38. For various reasons cancellation of whole Notification would be impracticable and hence Army cannot collect waterways dues. To meet local considerations following would therefore be most satisfactory course if you approve. 1. Military authorities and Port Directorate to reach provisional agreement unofficially as to what notifications they should respectively issue, so that Army shall collect dues in respect of harbour services which they themselves perform and which are at present listed in paragraph 3 of existing Iraq Notification. 2. As soon as this has been done I would tell Prime Minister that since Um Qasr is military port Army are running it entirely themselves but that at their request Port Directorate is undertaking waterway services. I would add that this means that Army should collect dues in respect of services covered by paragraph 3 of Iraq Notification and that they would therefore be issuing notification accordingly themselves. I would then say my attention had been ( omissio n) paragrapja 3 of an existing Notification issued by Port Basra which purported to authorise collection of dues on certain scale for their services. Prime Minister would appreciate that this paragraph was inappropriate in the circumstances. Military authorities were therefore approaching Port Directorate for its cancellation as a matter of form. - . i ■I would also point out to Priin6 Minister that sine© Lailitary were in any case performing all these services there was no financial aspect involved and ask him to explain matter accordingly to ?

Paragraphs l and 2 of this notification lay down certain scales of dues and pilotage charges for vessels using the water ways leading to the port of Umm Q.asr. in these waters, which are partly Iraqi and partly Kuwaiti, the Iraqi Directorate General of Ports and Navigation are at the request of the British | Military Authorities performing the services of pilotage, dredging lighting and buoying and it is recognised that they are entitled to recover charges in respect of such services. At the same time His Majesty's Government desires it to be understood that l the performance of these services and the Yest ablishment of charges therefore in no way prejudice the rights of H.H. the Shaikh of Kuwait in that portion of the waters which ?belongs to Kuwait.

I agree that you should take action on the lines that you propose subject to the following modif icat ions: (a) I think it undesirable to base your oral . • s- request to Prime Minister for cancellation of paragraph 5 Port of Basra Notification solely on the fact that this paragraph is administratively inappropriate without refer ence to the fact that it went beyond legal powers of the Iraq authorities. I should therefore prefer you to expand your statement on the lines proposed in your telegram No. 1262 of 1942 for written communication then under consider ation i.e. you should bring in a reference to the fact that the Shaikh ^aa well as the Iraq Government is concerned. ^ vr (b) Your draft note as it stands makes no reference explicit or implicit to the cancellation of paragraph 3 of Notification and v^buld therefore leave it open to the of Iraq Government to argue at a later stage/the case His Majesty's Government had raised no objection to paragraph 3 of Notification that calcellation of this paragraph before you wrote to them had no bearing on the subject and that therefore at least when your note was written E.M.Government saw no reason to object to collection of dues by the Iraq authorities in respect of services render ed at UM itself. I think it important to guard against this risk and as you wish to omit any mention of paragraph 3 of Notification you should add at the end of ?first paragraph ofyour note the words: 'as amended by Notification No. - of - w ?ijLe,. the notification cancelling paragraph 3.- 2 - Zl In his telegram Ko. 324 to Secy, of State for India the Political Resident urged that dues in respect of 'water way should be collected by military at UK Q^ASR® If paragraph 1 and paragraph 2 of Notification .are to stand, so that dues in respect of water way will be collected at rates specified by the Port of Basra, I see little advantage in collection of these dues by military authorities.

Dated 5th received 8th May 1943. Relayed by Govt, of India under tel. No. 3611 of 7th May 1943- Your telegram No. 202.' I have spoken to Prime Minister in sense decided. His Excellency refused to agree to cancel paragraph 3 of Notification on the ground that this would constitute an abrogation of Iraq's sovereign rights. He would not admit that Shaikh of Kuwait was concerned in collection of port dues at Umm Qasr. 2. Prime Minister gave me a detailed history of genesis of port (which owing to destruction of archives I cannot fully check) and claimed that there had mrver been any question but that port was in Iraq. No argument could move him from his attitude and it appeared useless to continue discussion. 3. So far as I can discover all discussions prior to 1941 were conducted on basis that if a port were built at Umm Qawr it would be in Iraq, and if this is so Prime Minister's stand is comprehensible. He has also a strong argument in that definition of frontier proposed in 1940 to Iraq Government indubitably gives present site to Iraq (see my telegram No. , Vol. h -lio- ^ j. ^ 1 Tour of 1942). If we now cast doubt on this point, boun dary question (which it is desired to avoid raisin during the war) will become a major issue which is likely to seriously disturb our relations with Iraq Government, In the circumstances I would urge matter be left in abeyance more particularly as military authorities have now decided that barring unforeseen developments it will nd&gt;t be necessary to bring port into use. 4.

A possible line might be that whether Iraq Government cancel their notification or not. His Majesty 1 s Government cannot agree to their working on it through Basra Port 9 Directorate or otherwise . (As port is to be on care and maintenance basis only, it seems war effort would not suffer from enforcement of such an attitude). It could be added that, though land frontier is in dispute, there is presum ably no doubt that approaches lie through Kuwait territorial waters.

Ae recorded in ay telo£ra^ 9 General Wwi wmld not admit that the Shaikh of Koweit was ir any way corxemed in the matter, i^or would he agree that it was more appropriate for the British Military authoriti perforning the services # to issue charges* 2# In a lorg disqtiisition on the history of the port the i^irie Minister observed that th&lt; project had first been nooted at a tlae when Perso-Iraqi relations ^ere strained and Ira&lt;i t / os looking for an access to the sea wftch would be imvm from Persian interference* lie recalled that Ills Majesty 1 s Goverment had been asked to arrange for the cession of War bah and Bubiyan Islands in order that Iraq might control the approaches absoluloly but had been unwilling to do so; his point was t however• that tlie ovmership of the port site had never been called in question. (In this account General Kuri oaitted to laention that tlie original proposal had been for a port on Koweit Bay itself| but the.point does not seem to be of iaportance*) furthermore, the Iraiii Parliament had, before ana since the outbreak of !K&gt;stilitie8t voted and spent noney on surveys and dredging. At no tirae had it been suggested that the Shaikh of Koweit was a claiaant to the area in which it was proposed to construct the port* 3 # I pointed out to His Excellency that the frontier had not been demarcated and that, until this was done, thr present yagu&lt; description left a considerable area in doubt« I recalled further that I had informed hi® of our intention to construct a military port at l&amp;a ^ o? 0ilT esire that the military authorities should themselves administer It witljout interference* He admitted the latter point and claimed l^hat had in fact left us a free hand* At th* sore time and wlxile he would be most reluctant in any way to imp&lt;*de the war effort, it '.vould be too rmch to expect hira to agree to the cancellation of thr notification iJid thereby admit that the ownership of the port site was in doubt* lie sincerely trusted that I should not have to raise the matter with him officially. The Tfta ^asr port project was familiar to everyone, having frequently been discussed in parliament and the press* If now he had to make it known that His Majesty* s Government disputed Iraq's title to the site, it would be im| ossible to avoid an acute pclltical crisis, which racust seriously disturb our present relations of close friendship and co-operation* 4. With the destruction of ir*y records prior to Slay, 1941, it is impossible for me to cos ment in detail on the genesis of the Xto Ki&amp;ar project* So far as I can judge, however, the main concern of His '!aje8ty # s Government at the time before Ita Qasr was definitely selected was that any port should be in Iraqi territory* Ifta ^asr appears to have been acceptable as a site on The Hight Honourable Anthony Fden M*C*, M*P*,10 a* ,/•/!(. , this ground# XT, then.

Reference Baghdad telegram 117 to you and Despatch No. 167 to Foreign Office. Um Qasr. 2. Ambassador frequently refers to destruction of his records. This handicap also affects Date Gardens case and I suggest that Foreign Office who presumably have printed or spare copies of important documents be asked to remedy deficiency which serioi^sly affects Gulf interests. 3. Nuri makes following points. (a) He refuses to cancel paragraph 3 of notification and evidently fully appreciates its value to Iraq. It will be S-^3,3 . remembered that Embassy acquiesced in this notification without consulting us. As we cannot force them to cancel it we must get round it. (b) That there has never been any question port is not in Iraq. This is simply begging the question. If Shaikh were told port area was entirely in Iraq he would protest equally vehemently. (c) That Iraq had voted sums for siiryeys and dredging. This can of course give them no clajm whatever in fact Shaikh protested at the time against their incursions (my T/209 of . IS2. k I fa March 21st 1940).^.^ j) (d) As regards the Shaikh not being claimant to port area Ambassador rightly points out frontier has never been defined. 4. Both in his telegram and despatch Ambassador suggests that it was the main concern of H.M.G. that port should be in Iraq territory. In this connection please see India Office / letter/4C - 2 - letter P,Z. 2596/40 of 16th May 1940 which was specially written to prevent the Iraqis making this claim. The site was not decided before the war but in August 1941 and Ward considered (Foreign Office' letter E 5116/68/93 of 6th August 1939 forwarded with India Office letter 6852/39 of 11th August) that site south of creek was definitely in Kuwait territory. This is the site which the military authorities have chosen vide Baghdad telegram ■p.Jfr/S 31- No,924 to Foreign Office repeated No,309 to Government of India dated 13th August 1941. Again since the Iraq Government never acknowledged the frontier proposals of 1940 they obviously cannot quote them against us, 5. It remains to consider what action should be taken. We cannot force the Iraqis to cancel their notification so the only course is to ignore it and issue a parallel notification without any reference to it. If our action is questioned we reply that it is being administered by the Army. The Basrah Port should be excluded unless hired as contractors and with cessation of activity there this should present little difficulty. Finally since approach lies through Kuwait territorial waters no concession of unilateral control by Iraq can at any time be contemplated without Kuwaiti consent. - BRITCONSUL - CONFIDENTIAL .

Hankeyj., Foreign Office, Mr. Syres } SIR M, j?KfKRSO!f explained that in 1941 the military authorities had decided as an urgent operational necessity to construct a port at Um Qasr in territory which was In dispute between Iraq and Koweit, As it was not possible at that time to delimit the frontier or decide between the conflicting claims of Iraq and Koweit 9 both sides were informed that the port itself and the area adjoining it would be operated by our military authorities for the duration of the war. The Basra port: authorities as a matter of practical convenience, were asked to undertake the maintenance of the waters giving access to the port, tind this led to a notification being Issued by the port Director which provided for the recovery of dues and charges in respect of the port itself. This clearly Implied the exercise by the Iraqi Government of rights at Ua Qasr and it could not be allowed to pass unnoticed. Representations by H*M. Ambassador had iailed to induce the Iraqi Prime minister to cancel this notification end the question now was what courses were open to His Majesty's Government. SIR M, P T RSON considered th&amp;t the most Important point was not whether the port area was in Iraqi or Koweiti territory, but whether, as a deep sea port on the Persian Gulf, it was not so valuable to us that wo could not ufforu to concede it either to Iraq or Koweit. We hoped tnat in fulfiliuent of the terms of the tripartite treaty with Persia both the Russians and ourselves would withdraw from that country after the war, and in that case it would be nocesaary to organise the defence of Aba dan from Iraq. COLOffJL 3PHA(W*TT said that the decision to construct this port was deoided upon at tne time when the German threat to the Caucasus was developing and when the Military Authorities considered it may become necessary as an emergency port as an alternative to Basra. It was purely a military concern and not dictated by Naval Interests. The Admiralty however, supported tne proposal on general Military grounds and accepted the minesweeplng and mine watching commitment which might have become necessary had the mining threat to the port developed. The future necessity for the use of the port would depend largely upon developments in that p^rt of the world during the post-war period, and in particular the attitude of Russia which seems likely for eone time to remain unpredictable. In the event ol trouble Urn Casr would no doubt be useful as a port through which military supplies to Iraq could be built up. The Depart chiefly/0 chiefly interested were the Var Office and Air Ministry. Colonel 3praggett was however^ inclined to the view that owing to the uncertainty of the future we ought to hold on to Ua Qasr and said that if the War Office end Air Ministry decided that we should retain control of the port he thought the Admiralty would support such a policy. CAPTAIN GKLL said that if Persia were hostile to us or under the influence of a hostile power, the 3hatt-al-Arab would toe denied to us and Urn Qasr would be a valuable alternative supply route. He thought that as -we were there we ought to stay there. The port was unsuitable for a navel base in the strict sen8e t even if it could be converted into one. He thought at present it would take ships of only about 21ft draught at low water and of about a8ft at high water. This would allow a large cruiser to enter the port; but felt that we should be most unlikely to require Urn r ;esr as even a temporary Naval base for there were more suitable faoilitiee available for Naval requirements elsewhere in the area. 1R. GOLMAN was understood to say that the trouble off the port was not enough swinging room for ships as the deep water was also narrow. MR, PBKL said that he thought the Sheikh of Koweit would have no objection to our keeping the port ourselves^ but he was determined not to let the Iraqis have it and would prefer us to destroy the works already constructed rather than hand the port over to Iraq. There was some discussion whether the port could be developed without including some Koweiti territory. %hile different opinions were expressed on this point, it was clear that the port could not be approached without passing through Koweiti waters. SIR M. PSTHSON said that it was clear that it would be necessary as a first step to send a formal communication to the Iraqi Government about the notification referred to above, which would safeguard our own position and that of the Sheikh of Koweit. This note should be couched in terms which would not require any reply. It was sgreed that the Foreign Office and India Office should draft a note on these lines. 3IR U. P^KRSON said that the next question was what steps should be taken to resolve the Koweiti~Iraqi dispute. ke could either suggest th^t the dispute be put to arbitration, or else evolve some &gt;0 cu;? viveadi which would leave us in control. Besides the reasons given above for retaining the port in our own hands, it was possible that the Basra Petroleum Company might develop oilfields in Southern Iraq after the war, and that the port would thus be useful as an outlet for their oil. CAPTAIN GKLL said that if Um Qasr became an oil exporting port* and therefore an alternative route to Shatt-al- Arab in case of necessity, the Admiralty would take a far greater interest in it. Its usefulness depended however as to whether the source of the oil were in friendly hands or not. # It was finally agreed that the War Office should be asked to produce an estimate of the cost of the port as originally planned as a 6 berth port of which Ijjr berths have been/oeen coiapletedj and, on the basle of this estimate Treasury sanction should be sought by the Foreign Office, with the concurrence of the Interested Dopartaents, for the coiapietion of the port after the war at lUM^O^'s expense. If the approval of the Treasury was obtained, the Iraqi Oovernoient and the Sheikh of Koweit could then be ap )roached. The aethod of approach would be for further discussion but the best line might be that H.M.O. should complete the port at their own expense and should retain control of it, and that each side should lease such portion of their territory as was necessary to H.M.G.( *tr;ct U.K. Delegation, Oentva No. 106), No. a - hir^IT . uv;ait pre sc at a tx tvyo-Toid probleja lor Ira^j , fa) it iias bdCuuie an eatrepot for e^tfcnsxvo arwa tr- fflc end e. u,ling; (b it . rr j r- c ' s acccri. to tht o ;t r t . 3. aq regards fb), Irar'e only channel or access to the see is at preernt the 3hctt-el-Areb.

The attention of His Majesty* a Qovemtaent has been drawn to Notice Ho. &lt;56 in the Iraqi Oovem^ent Oaaette No^4, dated the 14th June 1942, relating to the port of* Ua ^aar. 2« As the Iraqi Governiaent are aware, there has always been some doubt about the exact line of the frontier between Iraq and Koweit in this area.

Before construction was begun an attempt was made to delineate the frontier, but gave rise to such conflicting claims that, to obviate delay, the British Ambaa&amp;ador at Baghdad proposed, and the British Military Authroities agreed, that the latter should administer the port without the formal sanction of either the Kuwait or Iraii Governments. The ira^i prime ninister had agreed unofficially and said that the Iraq. Government would leave everything in the hands of Sir John Ward, their Director- General of Ports and Navigation. The Ambassador contemplated Sir John Ward^ activities being confined to buoying, dredgir and pilotage. The Ambaafaador•s proposals were accepted by all concerned. 2. The British Military Authorities then produced a plan for the administration of the Port. They did not consider a Harbour Master necessary, but contemplated the provision of an S.T.O* and a N.O.I.C.; and they proposed to confine Sir John Ward^ responsibility to the navigable waters of th&lt; Khor Abdulla and Khor zubair . 3. Going beyond this, however. Sir John Ward proposed to the Embassador the issue by the Iraq Government of an official Gazette Notification purporting to empower the Basra Port Directorate to impose harbour master's fees and other dues on all vessels entering Un ^asr. The ^mbaasador raised no objection and the Notification was in due course issued without the Political Resident or the Kuwait Government being consulted. 4. ab soon as it came to their notice the Political Resident and the Government of India protested and demanded cancellation of the Notification, on the grounds that it went beyond the terms of the agreement by wnich the British Military Authorities were to administer the port, that it ig nored Kuwaitis rights, and prejudiced her position. The Ambassador in his reply enlarged the scope of his original proposals concerning Sir John Ward's responsibilities to include conservaELcy, both of the approach' es and the Port area itself. He treated the Notification as the necessary legal authority to empower the Basra port Director ate to collect remuneration, a mere formalit; unilateral and not binding on His Majesty's Government --who are in charge of Kuwait interests. The Ambassador was opposed to raising objeotionfi, fearing that Iraqi co-operation would be adversely affected; / and 'M 2j o 4 6 • ^ » Q ii j: - ci ti &lt;.■•63. 1/ • 5 6 • 5.67 . .. #69 • and he euggeeted that as a matter of politioa; expediency, if an objection had to be made, the Shaikh of Kuwait should initiate it for the xiinbaBfaador to pre&amp;ent on hie behalf. 5. There followed a protracted correspond ence in which the pefrfilfcn Oulf Residency arid the GoTerniGent of India urged that the military suthorities should collect the port dues, and pressed firstly for cancellation of the notification ani later for communi cation to the Iraq Gorernment of a formal reservation regarding it* The Foreign Office were disposed to agree and sent the Arobasaador a draft letter for communication to the Iraq Governmexit• The Ambassador, however, was for milder approaches such as a verbal request for cancellation of one paragraph of the Notification, as a matter of form, on the grounds that the paragraph was inappropriate because it had subsequently been decided that the British Military Authorities would collect the port dues. 6. The India office were against basing the request for cancellation solely on the fact that the paragraph was administratively inappropriate and preferred that the communis cation should contain a reference to the fact that the Shaikh of Kuwait was concerned. When the ^mbasfaador did eventually approach the Iraqi Prime Minister the latter refused to cancel the offending para graph on the grounds that cnacellation would constitute an abrogation of Iraq's sovereign ty* He refused to admit that the Kuwait Government were concerned with dues relating to Um ^.asr, and proceeded to give an inaccur ate account of the genesis of the port which the Ambassador was unable to rebut, owing to the destruction of his records. 7. The Ambassador feared that to pursue the matter would raise the whole question of the Iraq-Kuwait boundary in an acute form and would seriously disturb our relations - with Iraq. He recommended that the whole question be left in abeyance, and used a current decision -- that only one berth would be completed and that the port would not be opened -- to support his argument. The IrrLian Political authorities, however, could not agree to the question being left in abeyance and urged the exclusion of the Basra Port Directorate, and that the Iraq Government be informed that His Majesty's Government could not concur in unilateral administration of the Port by Iraq. 8. The India office, too, favoured formal reservations; and, as a result of an interdepartmental decision in London, the ■fiiDbassador was asked for his comments on a - revised draft containing such reservations. He approved the draft, and it has since been communicated to the Iraq Government in the form of a Note Verbale.9. It wae latter^* 6uggeeted in London that Uta ^aer should be completed after the War and retained in Britibh hands on strategic grounds• This question is still under consideration. 66. a copy of telegram No, 24296 from the India Office to the Government of India — the last reference on the subject — is attached • Sd • G.N •JACKSON#</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000204_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/1/543</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000204</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/1/543</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 53/87 IV British Policy in Kuwait'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1942/1946</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2014-08-16T00:01:23</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (56 folios)</extent><extent>File is arranged in chronological order, from earliest at beginning of the file to most recent at end.Serial numbers refer to entries in the notes at the rear of the file: red for incoming, blue for outgoing correspondence.</extent><extent>Condition: The file was previously bound by a treasury tag but the tag has since been removed and its pages are now loose between two covers.Foliation: The file has an incomplete foliation sequence and a complete foliation sequence.
