PC.27/82. 3rd June, 1938. Your Highness, I venture to write, firstly to express tne hope that you have enjoyed the remaining part of your travels and are concluding them in good health: and secondly to refer again to the subject which we discussed at the laso interview which you kindly accorded me at the Dorchester Hotel, London - that is, the proposed geological exploration party which my Company would wish to send to your country in the autumn of the present year. As I explained to Your Highness, the regions of your country in which our geologists are most interested (from the point of view of the possibility of discovering oil; are those to the west and south-west of the main Ha jar range of mountains. As a large part of this region is not, we understand, at present available for exploration, the nresent proposals are limited to the area north of the twenty-third parallel, that is, the districts of the 7/adi Hawasinah, Yanqul, Dhank, and to the north of these places up to the limits of your Sultanate, including Jabal Hafit, Baraimi, etc. Your Highness will appreciate that within this area (and to the south and south-west of it, if possible) our representatives would wish to be able to make their reconnaissance as widely and as freely as possible. It is proposed, also, to make use of a four-engined aeroplane, which would permit aerial reconnaissances both of the same area and of areas in the south of Your Highness' territories, where a line of aerodromes exists along/2 . 2 ~ f &gt; along the coast from Salalali to Has al Hadd inclusive, and from the latter place along the coast to the na tn. In this connection, and with special reference to air exploration of the inland districts, we are moot anxious to be able to land at or near Baraimi, and Tour Highness informed me verbally that you hoped to be able to help us in this by directing the levelling of a landing-ground there. We consider this matter to be of great importance. In connection with Baraimi landing-ground, and in general with help which we may secure from the Shaikhs and headmen of the interior, the Company will, of course, be ready to show its appreciation by suitable presents to the persons concerned. It has been understood that Your Highness is returning to Muscat towards the end of the present month. In that event I venture to hope that it may be possible for you to find time to consider the questions and problems which may arise from our programme as suggested above. If our expedition is to operate during the forthcoming autumn and winter, we are compelled to make arrangements some months ahead, and these can be made only upon -uhe basis of fairly definite decisions regarding the movements of the party. Does Your Highness consider that it would be of assistance in reaching these decisions if I visited you at Muscat during July (after the return of Major Watts)? If you feel that this would be desirable (as you indicated, I think, during our conversation in London) I will arrange it.

Longrigg.Confidential British Agency, Sharjah. 14th June 1938 No.C/396-3/1&lt; To, The Political Agent, Bahrain. Memorandum. With reference to your verbal order, I beg to submit below a report about the visit of Shaikhs, Saqr bin Sultan an-Nuiaimi and Muhammad bin Rahman bin Salmin of the Albu Shamis:- 2. Shaikh Saar bin Sultan . He paid a freindly visit to Has al Khaimah on 30th May 1938, Urn al Qaiwain (1st June), Ajman (2nd June) Sharjah (4th June) and Dubai (6th June) He left for Buraimi on 8th June. During his visit to Ajman A he was engaged to the daughter of the Shaikh of Ajman who is a distant relative of Saqr bin Sultan. No date has been fixed for cermony but will probably take place about the end of the hot weather. He is on good terms with the Shaikh of Ajman and has strengthened their friendship by entering into »*Ahad al tAsabah 1 (taking oath of being an ally at peace and war)* Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr also entered into tAhad al * Asabah* with Shaikh Saqr bin Sultan. He is also on good terms with the Shaikh of Has al Khaimah, but, when he left Has al Khaimah he was not very pleased with the Shaikh. The reason being that the Shaikh of ties al Khaimah gave him »Shafiyah» (present) of six bags of rice, which, instead of giving him at Has al Khaimah he gave him a chit against Husain bin liutah a pearl merchant of Ajman who is indebted to Shaikh Sultan.2 He is on good terms with the Shaikh of Um a-i- Qaiwain and Dubai and also the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi whom he condiserss as his protector* Shaikh baqr is not on good terms with his brother Shaikh Muhammad of Dhank and is always afraid of being killed by him* Muhammad is more diplomat, generous and brave person. Saqr is a miser and is not liked by the majority of«the Albu Khuraiban-Nu f ainu He is also not on good terms with Ahmad as Saif the Shaikh of the Albu Khuraiban - Nu'aim and is a first class ^twister*. Ahmad hi as Saif is also the brother in law of Muhammad bin Hahman bin t&gt;almin of the Albu Shamis* Since late Saqr has not been on good terms with the Albu Shamis owing to certain trouble which took place between the ash-Shuwamis tAyah HABIB of Wasit and f Ayal Dhawi of Hail and Rabi all of which places are at Wadi al Jiza* Shaikh Sa^p» exercises absolute authority over Burdmi and Satarah villages. The total strength of Shaikh Saqr is 450-500 men. Saqr f s mother is the sister of the late Shaikh of Bani Ka»ab Salim bin Duyain whereas Muhammad f s mother is from the Nu»aim. Muhammad is the elder brother. In case of war between Saqr who is uhafri and a Hinawi Shaikh like Abu Dhabi or Dubai, all the Bani uhafir support him even his enemies. 3. fflihammad bln Kahmah bln Salmln . He is the chief of the Albu Shamis bedouins. He is the cousin of Shaikh Rashid bin Hamad, chief of the Albu Shamis. His total strength is about 600. He owns Falaj Al,Jabil at the foot of Jabal Hafit on the southern side and Sunainah village about 30 miles south of Jabil and is his headquarters. On 20th May Shaikh Muhammad bin Rahmah paid a visit to Abu Dhabi, Dubai (1st June) Sharjah(4th June) Hira (6th June)- 3 - Ajman (7th June) Himriyah (8th June) 0m al (Jaiwain (9th June) flirariyah (10th June) Hira (11th June) Sharjah 12th June. His visit is friendly one and for the purpose of getting Shafiyah (Present) He intends to go to Bahrain to see Shaikh Sir Hamad to speak to him about the Nu f aim who asked Muhammad bin Rahmah to obtain permission for them from Shaikh Sir Hamad to live on the Trucial Coast instead of their present place on the mainland between fujair and Salwa. Muhammad bin Rahamah is on good terms with King Bin Sa f ud and the Amir of Hasa. In December 1937 he paid a visit to Hasa. Shaikh Rashid bin Hamad is the peramount chief of the Albu Shaimis but cannot do anything without the approval of his relatives. The persons consulted are Muhammad bin Rahmah, Muhammad nin Hamad, brother of Shaikh Rashid, Mashari bin Muhammad, Salim bin Muhammad al Mismari, Shamis bin Hamad and tAbdul f Aziz bin Sultan bin Shamis * Shaikh Rashid lives at Hamasah village which is adjoining Buraimi village on the western side. The total strength of Hamasah is about 300. The Chalabnah, a sub section of the Albu Shamis own gardens at Hafit village and have a tower of their own situated on the eastern side of Hafit village. The Albu Shamis are on very&gt;bgood terms with the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, Shaikh Zaid, brother of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi is married to the daughter of Muhammad bin Ramah Their relations with the rest of the Shaikhs of the Trucial Coast are good and also with the rest of the tribes except Albu Khuraiban-Nu * aim who are under Shaikh Muhammad nin Sultan of Dhank.4 Abu, .Efc a fcL.

As v/e felt some doubts about your proposal to invite Petroleum Concessions Limited to invoke Article 10 of the Political Agreement in regard to opening up the Jahal Faiyah area we thought it advisable to consult our Legal adviser in the matter, and I enclose for your information a copy of a note setting out^his views. Note by Sir H. PearsonW 3. ^s you will see he is of opinion that dated 8th June 1938.) ? Article 10 could be brought in to operation provided that it can be definitely established that the Sheikh of Sharjah has failed, in the time which has elapsed since the signature of the Concession Agreement, to take such steps as were reasonably possible to make the Jabal Fai„ah area available and to remove the obstacles in the way of allowing the/LI 1 * w \ 2 . the Company's geologists to survey the area. This* as Sir Herbert Pearson states; is a question of fact which must depend on all the surrounding circumstances and as we have insufficient evidence on which to form an opinio 1 , we should be grateful if you would let us have a full report in the matter ? together with your considered views in the light of the Legal Adviser's opinion. Copies of this letter (and enclosure) are being sent to the Government of India and the Political Agent, Bahrein. Yours sincerely,P.Z. 3549/38. It seems to iDe clear from the special provision relating to the Al-Payah area, in Schedule 1 Clause C of the commercial agreement, that some reason must have existed for this special treatment. It may he that the Sheikh's control over it as a part of his territories was doubtful and accordingly that he was not in a position to secure protection to the Company under Clause 15 of the agreement. Since, however, the provision is only intended to be 'for the present' it seems reasonable to suggest that the Sheikh was under an obligation to take such steps as were reasonably possible to make the area available, and to remove the obstacles (whatever they were) in the way of allowing the company to work that particular area. Under Clause 10 of the Political Agreement prior permission of the Sheikh is necessary for working any area, only in the case of Al-Payah it has to be in writing. Clause 10 might be brought into operation in both cases, but since Al—Payah has been specially dealt with by the Clause in the Schedule of the Commercial agreement, there must, in all likelihood, be special circumstances attaching to that area which, in assenting to that Clause, the Company has recognised no less than the Sheikh. The question of whether it is reasonable to withhold permission, under any clause of this character, is a question of fact which must depend on all the surrounding circumstances. (Sd. ) H. G.

CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS Dated the 27th June 1938 Will you please refer wto Peel’s demi-official letter No. P.Z. 3549/38 dated the 18th June 1938 regarding Jebel Faiyah* 2. Past history can be very briefly summarised, - the abortive expedition of the Shaikh of Sharjah last winter, sub sequent rumours of ideas of assassination of the Beni Kitab Shaikh, and a particularly futile report that the Shaikh of Sharjah intended to reduce the Beni Kitab by force. In other words complete and absolute failure on the part of the Shaikh of Sharjah to arrange to make Jebel Faiyah available. 3. As reported however in my Diary No. 10 of 1938, the Shaikh of Sharjah met Shaikh Khalid of Kalba on the 16th May and gave him a sum of Rs. 1500/- M to help him in arranging matters betv/een him and the Shaikh of the Beni Kitab'. The Residency Agent reports that Shaikh Khalid returned to AJman a few days ago and that he is very hopeful of arranging the matter v^ith the Beni Kitab. The Residency Agent concludes his remarks with the following words:- 'Shaikh Khalid says that he wants a little time before he could give adefinite assurance about the matter. He is also trying to solve other matters as soon as practicable which I believe will be soon.' I have my own suspicions about the meaning of this last senten ce but as I may be v/rong I will not record them on paper. 4. In these circumstances it maybe well to wait a little while before replying to Peel's demi-official letter referred to above. Now that the Shaikh of Sharjah has at last unloosen- ed the purse strings something may possibly be effected. I am instructing the Residency Agent to keep me informed of develop ments and will report again as soon as possible. Yours sincerely, /A The Hon'ble Lieut-Colonel Sir Trenchard Fowle, KCIE, CBE, C/C Postmaster, Karachi.Reference paragraph 3 of the Residencv Agent 1 s confi- dential memorandum No. C/396 dated the 14th June 1938, a copy of which was forwarded to you with my Printed letter No. C/410 dated the 21st June 1938, in regard to Shaikh Muhammad bin Rah- mah bin Salmin. 2. Shaikh Muhammad bin Rahmah has arrived in Bahrain on a visit to His Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad and came to see me yesterday. He claimed that he was the Shaikh not only of the nomad Albu Shamis who roam in Khatan but also of those ft who live in the villages of Sunainah, Jubail and Hormuz in Dhahirah. He claimed also that the main part of Jebel Hafit belonged to him and his cousins, but that a small portion on the north belongs to the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi (through the A1 bu Felah) and another small part on the east to Shaikh Ahmad bin Rashid al Saif of the A1 bu Kharaiban. He apparently claimed equality with his cousin Shaikh Rashid bin Ahmad. 3. Amongst other questions I asked him how the Al bu Shamis anu. ohe Al bu Kharaiban regard the Sultan oi 1 T.Tuscat* He stated that since the days of Sultan Saiyed Azzan, no Sultan of Mus cat has had any authority whatsoever in that area, and that both sections of the Naim are completely independent. (The prospect of P.C.L. approaching Baraimi and Jebel Hafit through the good offices of the Sultan of Muscat appears therefore very remote). 4. X did not myself raise the question of a visit to Hafit next cold weather, as I understand that the Muscat approach holds/- Tlie Hon’ ble Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Trenchard Fowle, KCI3, CBE, Political Hesident in the Persian Gulf.mmm holds the field at the moment. Nevertheless I made it clear that I was deeply interested in that part of the world and very anxious to see it, and suggested that I hoped some day to pay him a visit, W which might be to our mutual advantage”. As a small aid to pleasant relations I gave him a present of Rs. 100/-, and in reply to a request for a rifle for his son I said that I expect/^to meet him again some day soon and would bear this in mind. 5. Shaikh Miharamad raised one point which it might be worth while following up in order to establish good relations. Ke told me that a certain Sulairaan bin Saif al Shibli had been imprisoned about a year ago in Muscat for raiding and plundering the Batineh Coast villages, and he asked me to use my influence to obtain his release. He said that he was afraid that if this man were not released his followers might create trouble for the people of the Batineh Coast, and that he himself would find it extremely difficult to restrain them so long as their leader was imprisoned. He undertook that he would be responsible for Sulaiman bin Saif if He were released and sealed the enclosed undertaking. I said that I could not give him a reply, and certainly could not promise that his request would be met, since Muscat was not in my area, but that I would pass on his remarks. I trust that I may be acquitted of any wish to interfere in another Agency, but from my own point of view it would help to cement the good relations now established if it were possible to act on this request. 6. Shaikh Muhammad struck me as quite a pleasant person though I think he might be a fairly slippery customer if it came to more intimate dealings. Yours sincerely,I, Shaikh Muhammad bin Rahmah al Shamsi, signatory of man bin Saif al Shibli, if released from prison, will not commit any evil act or indulge in a hostile movement or make any attack within the territory of Muscat and Batinah« Should he commit any act in contravention to this under taking, I shall 'be responsible for it.

XXX7/ith reference to P,C.L f s proposed exploration in the Trucial Coast Hinterland next winter, Packer came to see me early in June to enquire what was 'being done here about arrangements for visits to Jebel Faiyah, Jebel Hafit and Baraimi* I told him that the action v/hich had been pro posed in regard t o Faiyah was temporarily in suspense, but that I had no doubt that we should have some plan ready b e- fore the end of October, As for Jebel Hafit and Baraimi T remarked that his own Company appeared to wish to make their approach via Muscat, and if that was their present idea I should do nothing on my side unless a definite request were received, which would have to be made to the India Office and the Political Resident, for alternative arrangements via the Trucial Coast. I enclose a copy of a letter No. 1091 dated the 3rd July 1938 which I have received from Packer. 2. It seems from this letter that P.C.L. are focussing their attention on Muscat and I wonder if you will think it worth while warning them that the possibility of an approach to Baraimi and Jebel Hafit via Muscat is extremely remote. It is a little distressing to contemplate the moral certainty that, if P.C.L. concentrate solely on the Muscat line of app roach, another winter will pass without any exploration being done. We are at last beginning to get in touch wit! some of the Hinterland Shaikhs, and it would be rather a pity not to take advantage of this - and of the slightly chastened mood of/ «The Honourable Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Trenchard Fowle, KCIS, CBE, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. s[of: the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi (which be even more chas*tened by October). ^/vb 2, T enclose also herewith a copy of a report, No. C/429 dated the 1st July 1938, from the Residency Agent*, Sharjah, in regard to a conversation and exchange of letters with Shaikh Saqr bin Sultan an-Nu* aimi. Yours sincerely,D0/PTC/SAD4/1091. CONFIDENTIAL 3rd July, 1938. My dear Weightman, TKPCIAL COAST 5UHVEYS Subsequent to a visit to you in early June I gave London the situation as under : 1. Jabal Faiyah The P.R.’s first plan has been abandoned and no other plans are yet in train. It is fairly certain however that some plan to get to Faiyah will be ready to be put into operation by October. 2. Jabal Hafit No concrete plans to visit Jabal Hafit from the Trucial Coast side are under consideration pending the examination of the scheme to get in from Muscat. 3. Bara imi From Muscat side As (2 ). From Trucial Coast side Visit could probably be arranged through Abu Dhabi. Air Surveys The Political Department are waiting for concrete proposals by P.C.L. for the use of 4-engined (civil) planes and P.C.L.’s decision as to the necessity or otherwise of an air advanced base at Baraimi. 4.• • • - 2 - In general, the Political .Department considered it would be helpful if P.C.L., as far as circumstances permit at present, would prepared Sc submit concrete proposals for exploration with alternatives as necessary on which the Political Department could consider their own preliminary arrangements Sc plans. It was brought to notice that the Political would like to know if the Company proposed definitely to conduct an aerial survey using either 4-engined civil aircraft or R.A.F. machines, and if they considered the Baraimi base necessary to such aerial surveys or not. The undermentioned replies were received from our London principals : 'Ref. Paragraph 5 (Baraimi) . It is difficult to believe that the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi could not introduce the Company 1 s party to Baraimi with the utmost ease, if he wished to do so, since a large part of the date gardens there actually belong to his family. As things stand to-day, however, it might not be the best policy to use Baraimi under Abu Dhabi auspices, since these would help us nothing towards getting further south. w 'Ref. Paragraph 4 (Air Surveys) . It is hoped to put up a definite scheme involving the use of aircraft as soon as further discussions have been held with Political and with the Sultan. It can, I think, be taken for granted, even at this stage, that if the Company arrives in the Oman Sultanate with a 4-engine plane it will be allowed to use any existing landing-ground. There is no doubt that a landing-ground at Baraimi is required as badly as ever, and would make a vast difference to the Company’s ability to explore the country profitably. You may indicate this to the Political Agent.' 'Ref. Paragraph 5 (General) . In so far as the present plan is to base the exploration on Muscat territory and not in the(JT) &amp; first instance on the Trucial Coast, it is presumably with P.A. Lluscat (and, of course, with P.R. as usual) that we must make our plans, and this is being done. Anything decided in consultation with them will be communicated to you, for passing on to P.A. Bahrain, at the earliest moment.” 'The scheme for using R.A.F. aircraft is at present in abeyance.” ”P.A., Bahrain is probably aware, as the P.R. certainly is, that the Sultan of Muscat claims the Baraimi oasis, and protested when the Company f s party entered it over a year ago under auspices other than his. If, therefore, we are hoping to base ourselves upon Muscat, it would psrhaps be unwise to treat Baraimi as somebody else’s at the same time.” It will thus be seen that - The Company puts up the view that as Muscat is interested in Baraimi and the Company are anxious to see the country to the south it might be better not to use Baraimi at the present juncture under Abu Dhabi auspices. It is hoped to put up a definite scheme for aerial surveys based on Muscat territory - (The scheme for using R.A.F. aircraft is in abeyance). A Baraimi landing-ground is highly desirable (If Abu Dhabi is not to be used at present presumably the Sultan of Muscat has to arrange this?). There are no comments on the possibility of visits to Jabal Faiyah 8c Hafit from the Trucial Coast side. 7. (a) v (b) (c) (d) H. Weightman, Esq., I.C.S., The Agency, Bahrain. Yours sincerely, (*^gd.)

Hy opinion is as expressed previously. The Shaikh, who has been given ample time to get the Company into Jabal Paiyah, has failed to do so. The fact that can be deduced from this is that he is unable to get the Company into that area. If the latter are in fact to enter Jabal Paiyah, then the only way, though this is not an absolute certainty, is to invoice Article 10 as I have f suggested, and to turn to some other shaikh. if we are not to pursue this course of action, as far as I can see the Company must remain out of Jabal Paiyah. * I am sending copies of this letter to Metcalfe and Weightman 5fc- R.T.

The Sultan has said tnat ne will be able to arrange for tne Company^ geologists to visit Jebal Hafit and Baraimi from Muscat territory - under Muscat protection. As you will see tne Company wish to send a second party from Sharjah to Baraimi to meet tne first party, and their idea is that the combined parties should wer M towards the coast, seeing interesting places such as Jebel Faiyah on the way. 3 # I should like you to fly to Sharjah by tne next air mail and consult the Residency Agent on tne likelihood of suen a plan being possible. In particular I should liice your combined opinions on the following questions s (a) / {Signature) S. 44. Designation)- 2 - (a) Who in the Baraimi Oasis is lively to aid and snelter a party arriving there under Muscat auspices r (b) What are the lively reactions of ( l) the ShaiKn of Abu Dhabi and (2) the Al Bu Shamis and the Na’im generally. Is it likely tnat opposition would be organised against the Muscat party ? (c) If the Muscat party geta to Baraimi, with whom are we to make arrangements (1) for the second party to go by cars frcm Sharjah to Barpimi (2) for the two combined parties to return to tne coast via Jebel Taiyah. Could the Shaikh of Dubai do anything about arrangements to get from Sharjah (or Dubei) to Baraimi and from there as far as the borders of the Beni Kitab country (i.e. Jebel Faiyah), or alternatively for a journey straight from Debai or Sharjah to Baraimi and back. In other words is there any possibility of moving between Baraimi and Sharjah by any route without invoking the assistance of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi ? (d) Have any arrangements yet been made by Shaikh Khalid (Regent of Kalba), to settle matters between the Shaikh of Sharjah and the Beni Kitab (cf. Bahrain demi-official letter ifo.C-420-2t&gt;/4 of 27th June 1938.) If not what are the prospects of a settle ment within the next two months ? If necessary the Residency Agent should see Shaikh Khalid and make definite enquiries, though I hope the Residency Agent already nas information and that this will not be necessary. («)/-3- (e) Would it be at all safe or poeaible for the car Party from Sharjah to go to Baraimi* pick up the Muscat party and return direct to Sharjah without any preliminary arrangements being made at all ? (f) Does the Residency Agent know if there are any flat pieces of hard ground in the Baraimi area not under Abu Dhabi control, which might possibly be used as an aerodrome ? (In this connection you will find in the Bahrain files a rough description of the country and of the routes followed by Williamson when he went there two winters ago. Will you please let me nave a copy of tnis and also the sketch map which he prepared and on which the possible areas for aerodromes are marked ?) 4. Please send your report by air mail from Sharjah as soon as you have seen the Residency Agent, Officiating Political Resident in the Pers ian Gulf.ROUTES IN THE TRUCIAL COAST STATES The following were the main routes used by the oars of our party during the winter of 1936-37, 1. Dubai to Has al Khaim s. This follows the ooast all the way, and is fairly easy to trace. The only difficulty is at the stretoh Just before reaching Has al Khaima, where it is necessary to drive along the shore below high water mark. Arrival there should be timed to coin cide with low tide. An alternative route can be taken a short distance inland, but it is very rough and sandy. Normally the trip takes from three to four hours. 2. Sharjah to Dhaid and beyond . From Sharjah the going is good as far as the end of the *Sabkha* south-east of jkjman. Thence there are several miles of rough sandy going to Tel Ah. Eastwards from that hill, a very well defined camel track which is sandy but not difficult, leads successively past a prominent dune called Ali Zobeir, a depression known as El Houeyah and a well Loughalla. From this point a dry stream course gives a good route south east to the old fort at Dhaid, where there is a canal of excellent water which is slightly warm. From Dhaid we were able to drive about 25 miles due south to the corner of Jebel Rodha, over fairly easy ground. Our escort would not take us farther, but we gathered that with the exception of about a mile of sand there was no serious physical obstacle to prevent a oar from reaching Biraimi. Sharjah to Dhaid should take 2 to 2g hours and two hours more should suffice to reach Jebel Rodha. The going from Dhaid by way of the valley called El Jerri to Has al Khaima is not difficult, and it seemed to us that the logical route to the interior through Biraimi would be either from Sharjah or Ras al Khaima via Dhaid. 3. Dubai to the South . A circular tour which covered a large part of Dubai territory was undertaken. The route was all sandy and rather heavy going. The following places were passed : Roueya (well of bad water), Murra (a pleasant spot with some grass and trees and a well of brackish water), Bahaithat al Hibbarah (water pools after rain), Hezan (prominent sand hill), thence eastwards over a soft plain to Hameidha (prominent sandhill). This point was apparently not far from the eastern frontier of Dubai. From here the route turned south-west to El Eshush (a deep well with brackish water) over fairly easy plains, and then through heavy sand westwards to Hafir, or Hafair (a well which seems to be common to Dubai and Abu Dhabi). From this point we were guided northward to Jebel Ali by a rather devious and sandy way past Ghadur, Leian,■3H 87 - 2 - Ram er Ram and Kameran, all sand hills or ridges. Then from Jebel Ali a good traok along the shore brought us back to Dubai. 4. Dubai to Abu Dhabi . Leave by the shore route to Jebel All. There two alternatives present themselves. The quicker way is to the North of the hill, and it follows a series of sabkhas nearly to Semaih. This is not always passable after rain or strong rt shumals*. The second alternative skirts to the East of the hill along the track towards Kameran, and then turns south-west to join the first at Sernaih, a brackish water hole. It passes from there near the well of Moueilah and the hills known as ikjaij and then descends on to the Sabkha which stretches east from ikbu Dhabi. At a prominent rook called Nasailah a traok crosses the Sabkha west to Jyiaqta where a watch tower guards the ford to Abu Dhabi Island. Care should be taken to keep to the beaten track across the Sabkha, as any deviation from it is likely to cause the oar to break through the crust into a soft mess of brine and mud from which it is very difficult to extricate a vehicle. 5. From Abu Dhabi to Blralml . (a) Sheikh Khalifa once travelled by oar from Abu Dhabi to Biraimi, and we were shown his route; it was not good. After crossing the ford and returning to Nasailah it outs south from Hedabet Shakhbut to 11 Char over some bad sand. Thence the traok is heavy past a well Towai ed Dohan and a water hole Bedah al Ajam. From there eastwards the going is better to bed (well by prominent sandhill) and then but for about a mile of heavy going through some sandhills, is quite good to Lumwejeh, a small fort in the Biraimi oasis with good water. (b) We returned by a much better track, which was south of the outward one. Leaving Lurawejeh and cross ing several strips of plain (3eh el Neshesh) Lahamma, (Sandhill) was on our right, and we later passed a water hold Bedah Haramameh. Thence we continued to another water hole Ifushairif, and then made use of sabkhas to reach Umm Gatara and Maqta. The outward journey would be an extremely long and arduous days driving, but with a good guide the southern route could be done in a day, the distance being just over 100 miles. 6. Other Journeys a. An unsuccessful attempt was made to reach Jebel Dhanna from Abu Dhabi by car in March 1937 after rain. Apparently the journey had once been done by a truck which came from Jeddah, and we could still see the traces of its wheels. This had been done at the end of the dry season, however. We reached a point called Ram Ram Miyat by following sabkhas from Abu Dhabi and Umm Gatara, past Silimiyah and Gom Aniyat, but we had to abandon the trip there as the sabkhas were impassable beyond this point. By following a route farther inland it might be possible to complete the journey./ 1P 9 % (b) (o) (d) -3- Yas Island . We drove all round this island after landing oars very easily in the sheltered bay just by R.A.F. landing ground. Jebel Dhanna . V»e were able to reach Jebel Wutaid, some S5 miles south-west of J. Dhanna, and Uma er Rus a prominent hill about the same distance to ohe South, but sandstorms and lack of time prevented us from trying to go farther south along the eastern edge of the Sabkhat Matti. Khumels area . The area west of the Sabkhat Matti presents no great difficulty as it consists of a flat gravelly plateau dissected by a serious of valleys. Oars were landed at Khumeis opposite the island of A1 Fazaya. Less than 8 hours were required to visit '51 Baya and Si la, and return to the landing place. On another day a short trip to the South-west took us up on to the plateau towards a well called El Battha, some 24 miles inland. fte understand that itvould be possible to drive south as far as Sufuk across these gravelly plateaux. The cars used were a Ford Saloon and a Ford van, both fitted with 7 inch tyres, but the low pressure 9' tyres would have made the travelling very much easier. It should be noted that the spelling of place names is only phonetic as we have not had an opportunity of oheoking the Arabic names and transliterating them.BUS M?r ~ r-.nENCY.

Previously the A1 Bu Shamis were not allowed to open shops in Hamasah (Baraimi); but now they have taken advantage of Sheikh Saqr's weakness to do so. Shiekh Rashid bin Hamad has invoked the help of Abu Dhabi, and it is reported that Sheikh Saqr has submitted to Sheikh Shakhbut's arbitration- But he had prev iously appealed to Ajman, and Sheikh Rashid of Ajman left on August 24th. with 40 men. The Sheikh of Sharjah also intends to leave for Baraimi, via Abu Dhabi.

Please refer to your demi-official letter No.C/488, dated 2nd August 1938. 2 * Shortly before I left Muscat the Sultan informed me that the Sheikh of Baraimi Saqir bin Sultan had come in to see him and as a result of discussions he had had with him he was confident that there would be no difficulties in getting the Company’s Representatives into that place. The Sultan’s plan was he told me, for the party to proceed as far as Khaburah by car whence they would travel by camel straight through to Baraimi. They would be passed on from the territory of one Sheikh to another under arrangements made by the Sultan and would be accompanied throughout their journey by the Sultan’s own Representative Wall Mudhaffar. extitmeiy ditficult to say and can only be known when it is actually put to the test. It is true, that only a few years ago Betram Thomas was turned back when trying to get through to Baraimi but I believe that a good many changes have taken place since then even in that remote part of the world. The magic word 'oil' and all that it denotes has probably penetrated throughout this district and if the petty Sheikhs and their followers ( who pf course have almost as much say in such matters as the Sheikh himself) feel that the opening up of 3 How this plan will in practice work out it is their H.Weightman Esquire, I.C.S., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf at Karachi.- 2 - their country means a handsome windfall for themselves I thinh it quite probable that the geological party may be received with open arms* For the present the success of the plan depends almost entirely to what extent the Sultan has paved the way by payments in hard cash or the equivalent in presents. He has I know been*flirting* with the numerous Sheikhs of this district for some time past not only^ as recently ; with a view to make possible the entry of the Oil Company’s Representa tives but also with the object of bringing these districts under his own control and out of the Imam’s influence who has hitherto been the principal authority there* 4* The extent of the authority wielded by this Saqir bin Sultan in Baraimi is as far as I am aware an unknown quantity y and on this I should imagine depends a good deal the chances of the expedition's success* Certainly the Sultan himself appears very confident that he can get the party into Baraimi so his arrangements may 1 think at least be tried out. Whatever may be the actual result I do not anticipate any sort of violence being offered to the Company’s Representatives up to Baraimi itself at least* 5* On my last talk with the Sultan on this question he made an interesting admission* Previously he had always laid claim to ownership of the whole of the Baraimi district He now admits that some miles north of the village itself there are a number of valleys which belong to the Sfceikh of Abu Dhabi* The names of the small villages in them are &lt;rimi 9 Muraltib y Mas'udi, Kill*pfl ( 44 ) Confid&lt;ntial&gt; D« 0&gt; yo» C/6001 Offioe of the PolitioaX Resident in the Persian Gulf, Camp, Karachi.

It is now apparent from reports received both from tfatts and from the Trucial coast that one of these, namely, Shaikh Saqr bin Sultan of the a! bu Khuraiban - Ha’im. Shaikh of the Ha’im village of Baraimi, is the man by whose aid the Sultan now expects to get the party up to Baraimi. in the light of this information there is good reason to / I'- 2 - to expect that the party will arrire at Baraimi without undue difficulty. How ouch territory it will be able to see en route, particularly in the Haflt area, ia another matter| ^ and it would, I think, be well to draw atter* ion to a few salient facts. 4 # The most important tribes with permanent habitations in the Kafit-Baraimi area are the Ha* im, the Al bu Shamis» and the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi’s Dhawahir, I should mention here that the Al bu Shamis are by origin a section of the Na* im» while those who are now generally known as the Ha’im are actually the Al bu Khuraiban section of the tribe# The two are, however, quite separate from one another now and they are only too often on terms of hostility. Since the Na* im also havt Dh&amp;nk I will start this survey from there. (a) MASK# predominant power - the STa’im, under Shaikh Muhammad bin sultan, brother of Shaikh Saqr mentioned above. 3aqr and Mohammed are on bad terms and the former is said to be in constant fear of being killed by his brother, fatts does not know if Shaikh Mu hammed, has been 11 sweetened' by the Sultan, but it is highly probable that this is the case. (b) HAPIT# Holdings in three shares by (1) Al bu Sharais (2) Ha’im (3) shaikh of Abu Dhabi. I do not know the relative size of the holdings but I have heard am Al bu Shamie claim to the major portion of the area. (1) a! bu Shamis under Shaikh Muhaasaad bin Rahmah bin Salmln, cousin of shaikh Rashid bin Hamad, head Shaikh of the tribe (see below). I have met Shaikh Muhamnad bin /-3- bln Rahmah, whose headquarters are at Sunaina^i Tillage about 30 miles south of Jebel Hafit proper* He corresponds with Ibn Saud and the Amir of Hasa* but undertook in conversation with me to render any assistance possible if I wished to visit his country* * ( 2 ) SftLiSi* Under Shaikh Ahmad as Saif who is related by marriage to Muhammad bin Rahmah of the Al bu Shamis* He and Shaikh Saqr of Barahni are on bad terms* (3) Abu Dhabi , I have not very clear information regarding tne Abu Dhabi representation here* but I understand it is probably through the Al bu Pelah* (o) BaRaBCI OASIS occupied by (1) Abu Dhabi (2) Na*im (3) Al bu Shamis* ^ Abu jihabi holds by far the greater part through the Dhuwahir tribe with a total of over a thousand houses. The Shaikh of Abu Dhabi himself, his uncle and others of Abu Dhabi,own falajs and gardens which th$r visit in the summer. It is note-worthy that even the Sultan of Muscat has now admitted to Watts that Abu Dhabi owns the principle villages of ji»i, Muraijib, Mas'udi and Hili in the Oasis. I am also fairly certain that the only areas suitable for a landing ground will be found in the Abu Dhabi share of the Oa S i s . (2) Halim. Under Shaikh Saqr bin Sultan (the Muscat contact),owning Baraimi village proper and a village named Su f arah. shaikh Saqr recently entered into alliances with Ajman (which will be useful to him) and Sharjah (which will not), it is reported that hitherto he has regarded the Shai kh /-4- Shaikh of Abu Dhabi as hi a protector. (3) aJ. bu Shazaia . Under Shaikh Rashid bin Hemad, who lives in a village named Hamas ah. On excellent terms with Abu Dhabi. It is important to note that hostilities have recently broken out between Shaikh Saqr*s Na*im and the Al bu shamia of Baraimi. three men being killed on either side. It is significant that the fighting started very soon after Shaikh Saqr bin Sultan returned from Muscat with money and ammunition. 5. You will see from the above that Shaikh Saqr bin Sultan of Baraimi, on whom the Sultan is relying 9 is generally unpopular, and he has the reputation locally of being, to use the words of one report, M a first class twister*. It would perhaps be well for Petroleum Concessions Limited to know this. But the most important point to observe is that a Muscat party, relying on the aid of the Na*im Shaikh of Baraimi, may find themselves excluded from Al bu Shamis territory and will certainly be unable to enter any area under Abu Dhabi control unless direct negotiations are opened with the Shaikh. So far as the Al bu Shamis a re concerned the party may well expect to overcome difficulties when they arrive in the area by a Judicious distribution of presents, and I can give them a letter for Shaikh Muhaznaad bin Rahmah. But unless Petroleum Concessions Limited are prepared to miss out all Abu Dhabi territory, and to do without a forward landing ground near Baraimi for their aerial reconnaissance, I am convinced that they must negotiate with the Shmikh. I admit the difficulties - the hostile attitude he has adopted so /-5- «o f&amp;r 9 and his probable dislike of a party arriving in the Ha* im village of Baraimi under Muscat auspices; but even so I believe there would be a fair chance of negotiations being successful* I might mention that one of the principle men in Abu Dhabi, Shaikh Ahmad bin Khalaf bin ^t&amp;ib&amp;h, told the Residency Agent a few days ago that he himself could very easily arrange with the Shaikh to take a party to Baraimi, and though this man is one of the biggest scoundrels on the Coast it is quite possible that Petroleum Concessi ons Limited may be able to use him to arrange for a landing grcund and also for a visit to the Abu Dhabi part of the Baraimi-Hafit area* In view of the admission now made by the Sultan of Muscat (of* paragraph 4 (c) (1) above), the Company need not fear the loss of the Sultan's goodwill by so doing, and it seems that without Abu Dhabi co-operation neither the ground nor the air survey can be complete* 6. I am afraid I have been &amp; long time coming to the particular matter on which you asked my opinion, namely, the arrangements to be made for the final journey of the ccmbined Pai tj' fi om Baraimi to the coast* I notice that Longrigg has made no suggestions on the rather important question how the motorised unit is to proceed from Sharjah to Baraimi, and takes up the matter from the time when the two parties meet at Baraimi and proceed to the coast, visiting interesting territory on the way (obviously including Jebel Faiyah). Presumably the route they would like to follow is roughly along the line between Baraimi and Dhaid (due east of Sharjah, property of Shaikh Khalid, Regent of Kalba), with a detour to Jebel Faiyah itself. This I think could be arranged /6 - mS arranged In toto &gt; aesuming we over come the difficulty in regard to the shaikh of Sharjah^ written permission for a visit to Paiyah. There is also a physical difficulty in that a possible motorable track from B&amp;r&amp;imi past Jebel Faiyah is blocked by sand dunes abutting on Jebel Sumaini in the Beni Ka'ab area. This, however, is not insuperable since the strong man of the Beni Ka f ab, Shaikh Obaid bin Juma*» has twice verbally undertaken to clear the track through the dunes for Rs.100/-. (There will of course have to be other presents for the passage through Beni K&amp; f ab territory.) 7. Along this route the one important tribe is the Beni Kltab under Shaikh Muhammad bin ^11 who, as you know, is at loggerheads with the Shaikh of Sharjah. So strong are the Beni Kitab in the area north of Baraimi, that no party could move at all along this line without the aid and protection of this tribe, and having obtained their aid and protection it would be ridiculous to pass within sight of Jebel Faiyah and not visit it. Thus an Immediate solution of the 'written permission' problem is essential. It is possible that a solution will come in a few days, for it is reported that Shaikh Khalid of Kalba is expecting to meet Shai kh Muhammad bin ’All at Kalba and ’’hopes to arrange a P.C.L. visit with him tf . Rather more than two months ago there was a report that the Shaikh of Sharjah had handed over Rs.l5oo/« to Shaikh Khalid to fix things with the Beni Kitab, so it seems that Shaikh Khalid’s coning negotiations with Shai kh Muhammad bin ’All will be, ostensibly at any rate, on behalf of the ■K Shaikh of Sharjah. If these are successful there need be no further difficulty about obtaining the requisite parmiaaion. If /If they fail aolaly on account of the bitter hostility between Sharjah and the Beni Kitab, X still believe that Shaikh -&lt;nalid can, quite easily make all arrangements necessary with the Beni Kitab? and I think he snould be authorised to do so. It would th«i be necessary to take a firm line with the Shaikh of Sharjah and to tell him that arrangements had been made for a party to visit Jebel Faiyah, that they would go there with or without his permission, and that he had better save his face (and such future prospects he may have) by signing his name* I see no other way of 'persuading' the Shaikh of Sharjah, and it is necessary now to recognise the inescapable f&amp;ot that apart from purchasing Beni Kitab forbearance, as we understand he is trying to do throigh Shaikh Khalid, there is nothing whatsoever he can do to facilitate a visit to Jebel ?aiyah either now or in the future. 8* Once matters have been fixed with the Beni Kitab through Shaikh Khalid, the rest is simple, but I hope you will Impress on Longrigg that Beni Kitab co-operation is a sine ( frua non* I assume, incidentally, that the motorised unit from Sharjah would go out to Bar&amp;imi by the same route by which the combined party is to return* 9* In regard to the question of a Political Officer accompanying the exploration party, I think we must exclude the possibility so far as the Uuscat party is concerned, 1.e. from Khaburah up to Baralmi* The Sultan would almost certainly raise objections and sny difficulties en route would be ascribed to the presence of the Political Officer. On /t rf b - 8 - On the other hand I think it is most desirable to send a Political Officer with the SharJah-B&amp;raimi party. As I have indicated above we are beginning to get into touch with the Na'im and a! bu Shamis of Baxaimi and Hafit, and it is extremely desirable that this process should continue. It would also be a very great advantage to establish closer relations with the Beni Kitab v and a good deal of helpful information might be picked up during the journey, For Intelligence purposes I should also like to see a Political Officer included in the air survey party, and I hope it will be possible to arrange this, I see no bbject in a Sharjah representative accompanying the motorised unit, nor, I think, need they take any one from Ajm&amp;n, as things are now likely to turn out the Shaikh of Ajman will not be in the picture (it was never intended to use him as more than a negotiator between Petroleum Concessions Limited end the Beni Kit&amp;b), and his place will be taken by Shaikh Khalid, who is a close personal friend of his, 10, I apologise for the length of this letter but I thought you should have a fairly full picture of current politics in the back areas (so far as we know them) for your further discuaal ois with Petroleum Concessions Limited, 11.

Me thank you for your kind wishes. Me are pleased to inform you that we shall be pleased to receive your geological exploration party in the middle of October, 1938, and send an escort with it to explore the places mentioned in your letter including Biraimi which belongs to Oman. The question of the landing ground at or near Biraim of Oman will be settled, and we will give our views on the matter after the geological party has visited Birsimi and i surroundings and chosen a. ground for the landing of your aeroplanes. As regards the present landing ground from Salalah co Pas A1 Had and which you desire to use, this question will be settled also in October 1933. I hope you will come to Muscat in the month of October 1938, to enable each of us to/to discuss the matter from his ovm point of view. Please inform us if your geologists wish to visit Dhofar. If they wish to explore that part we shall indicate to them the places for such exploration. •. 7 e would suggest that the geological party should proceed from Muscat to Khahoura (on the Batinah coast 'by cars) and from there they should ride camels beginning with Wadi Hawes inah, and after v i sTTT!fr!f~aTT 'of'Dhahirah they should then proceed to Biraimi, Jabal Simani and Mshdah down to Sohar. These are the plans for your geological party and we do not think it will be necessary for you to visit Muscat before October 1938, as we hope your geologists will not encounter any difficulty in visiting the above places.

A copy of the note is being sent to the Government of India. Spare copies are enclosed in case you wish to let Weightman and Watts have a copy. We do not propose to say anything further to the Company at this stage. Sir T.C.W.Fowle, K.C.I.E., C.B.E. Aban Cou^t Hotel, Harrington Gardens, S.W.&gt;w Note regarding a discussion held at the India Office on 23rd September, concerning the proposed exploration of the hinterland of the Trucial Coast and adjacent territory. Present : Mr. J. C. Walton Sir T. Powle Mr. A.. C.B. Symon Mr. Longrigg ) ; Representing P.C.L. Mr. Williamson ) 1. Mr. Weightman’s letter No.C.600 of the 3rd September, was used as the basis of the discussion. A copy of the letter was shown to Mr. Longrigg and he was allowed to take notes therefrom. He was informed that we concurred generally with the views expressed by Mr. Weightman. 2. Mr. Longrigg confirmed that there would be two exploration parties, one leaving Muscat for Baraimi about 3rd November and the other leaving Sharjah for the same destination about 7th-10th November. It was anticipated that the Sharjah party (travelling in motor cars) would reach Baraimi a few days ahead of the Muscat party. The party will probably travel from Sharjah via Dhaid, and thence southerly in a more or less straight line to Baraimi, passing east of Jebel Faijah and west of Jebel Shamami. The exact route to be followed will depend to some extent on the physical difficulties to be overcome. 3. It was agreed that Major Watts should accompany the Muscat party as far as Baraimi, and that Captain Galloway should accompany the Sharjah party and remain with it until the work was completed. It was recognised that this may be a matter of months. The Company’s representatives expressedtheir agreement in these arrangements and undertook to provide the necessary transport . It was impressed upon the Company’s representatives that the exploration parties /''V It is understood that Major Watts’ future plans in clude a visit to Gwadur on 16th October to try an important case. Sir T. Fowle thought that this might have to he postponed. n must he guided hy the advice of the Political Officer- concerned as to whether any particular area which they wished to visit could he regarded as safe. Sir Trenchard Powle said that subject to this overriding consideration and to the general guidance of the Political Officers, It seemed unnecessary to place any restrictions on the movements of the parties. Sir Trenchard Fowle will, on his return from leave, take such steps as are necessary to obtain the Government of India’s agreement to make Captain Galloway available, and will issue the necessary instructions to Major Watts. Sir Trenchard thought it would be preferable if Major Watts returned to Muscat by the I6th October ^ in order to be present when Mr.Longrigg arrives. 4. Mr. Longrigg said that he would prefer not to ask any favours from the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi before the H I, II I — , - rT -r'.~ *i- nrn ^ v ,. ,.,-yrCXr T Sheikh had been again approached in regard to the concession aspect. In any case, the Company’s experts were of the opinion that on this occasion it might be unnecessary to visit any territory controlled by the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, and they were hopeful that a landing site could be found in an area slightly to the east of Jebel Hafit, which is outside Abu Dhabi’s control. The Company preferred to make local contact with the Abu Dhabi people, if such contact was found to be necessary. Sir Trenchard Fowle said that, so far as he was concerned, he/&lt;&gt; referred to in para. 7 of Mr. Weightman* s letter. r - cU . | ; | ;; ' • w 3. he was prepared to agree to this. 5. As regards the Jebel Faijah area, it was agreed that if the negotiations between the Beni Kitab and Sheikh Khalid (acting on behalf of the Sheikh of Sharjah) failed, it should be left to Sheikh Khalid actinp. directly on behalf of the Company , to try and obtain access to the Jebel Faijah and adjacent territory. If this is done, it will be necessary to decide what steps should be taken with the Sheikh of Sharjah. Two courses appeared to be open, viz.- (a) To tell the Sheikh at once that the Company had invoked Article 10 of the political agreement, and were making other arrangements (with the consent of the Political Resident) to visit the precluded areas, or (b) to say nothing to the Sheikh unless he himself objected at a later stage. Course (a, seemed preferable though Mr. Longrigg said that the Company would prefer the second course if possible, and Sir Trenchard Fowle undertook to discuss the matter with Mr. Weightman on his return to the Gulf.

After Complimen letter No. 674 dated the 8th Ramadhan 1357 (i.e. 1st Usual EndingConfidential EOPY Abu Dhabi, November 20th, 1938* % Dear Mr. Weightman, A few scraps of information before I leave the Coast. (i) Ahmad bin Khalaf came round this morning and had a long talk with Lermitte and myself, trying to negotiate the aerodrome. It seemed that Shakhbut was prepared to accept Rs. 5000/- per mensem for 3 months; though one cannot be certain that Ahmed was not just flying a kite on his own. Anyway, it could not be accepted. Lermitte rose to Rs. 2000/-; and eventually I suggested to him an initial payment of Rs. 1500/- and Rs. 50/- a day. Lerraitte offered this; Ahmad tried very hard for Rs. 100/- a day, but Lermitte naturally would go no further. Ahmad was very anxious to make a settle ment, as he said it would strengthen his position as nego tiator for the concession. He also pointed out that Shakhbut was charging nothing for the Baraimi trip. But as he has just let us know that we are to take 5 guards at Rs. 50/- each, this can only be regarded as a delicate understatement! (ii) In Majlis this evening, Shakhbut told me that Shaikh Sa'id had sent him word that the Aulad Rashid party were not paying up his domestic expenses, as per agreement; and Sa^d had asked him (Shakhbut) to tell me. I said that I couldn't in any case do anything about it, as I was off td Baraimi next morning. I met Shaikh Mana* and the others while I was in Dubai, and found them much better company, if nothing else, than Sa'id and Juma'. (iii) An Indian bunnia was at Shakhbut's majlis this evening, and said he was oppressed. I told him to put it into writing, as I couldn't deal with the matter there and then. I don't suppose it is anything really . 2. I am afraid I have sent you an appalling sheaf of paper by this mail; but I thought that a fairly full account of/.of our doings here now might be helpful when the concession airing starts. I hope all is well in Bahrain, and that you are not getting too much routine work left on your hands. Yours sincerely, Sd/- J.B. Howes.Copy Confidential. Abu Dhabi, 20th November 1938. O Dear Mr. V/eightman, You will have had my telegram saying that Shakhbut demands Rs. 10,000/- per mensem for the Baraimi aerodrome; for a 6 month period, too . One cannot really 'negotiate' witn such a man. I enclose copies of a note I made of the preceding negotiations, which you may care to read. 2 . Ahmad bin Khalaf talked to Lermitte last night, and said that he could get the price cut by half (also, incident- ally, could get the concession), by tomorrow. But even this (5000) is a fatuous price. I doubt if Ahmad counts for any thing like as much as he would have P.C.L. believe (they don* t, of course). Shakhbut has been telling both him and Hazza to hold their tongues, in Majlis. I gather, incidentally that his original demand was for Rs. 20,000/^-p.m.; but that Shaikh Khalifah got him to reduce it by halft 3 . I sent Abdul Latif round while they were discussing the three alternative proposals, ostensibly to ask when I should return Khalifah's call; and he heard a voice, which he could not identify, saying that they should a sk for Rs. 500/- p.m. for the 6 month period. I imagine that if Shakh but persists in turning down good money by his fantastic demands, he will sooner or later be 'replaced'. However, at present he is very much top dog. 4. Lerraitte^ present plan is to keep them guessing (he has let it be understood that he is going back to consult Longrigg about the price), while Williamson tries to find an aerodrome in Na^ra or A1 Bu Shamis land. 5. We all leave at early morning tomorrow. They are find ing difficulty in getting enough camels together before the Id, so I don’t know when I shall be able to communicate with you again: but I will do my best. Yours sincerely, Sd/- j.B. Howes.Memorandum of negotiations with Shaikh Shakhbut at Abu Dhabi 17th/18th November 1938. Shaikh Shakhbut called after dinner on 17th November accompanied by Shaikhs Hamid, Buti, Hazza, Khalid, Mohammad bin Khalifah and Ahmad bin Khalaf. 2. After civilities, Mr. Lermitte broached the proposed trip of the geological party to Baraimi and also hinted at further negotiations with regard to the concession, by Mr. Longrigg and himself. Shaikh Shakhbut listened and asked for details of the proposed journey. Mr. Lermitte replied eva sively, but I pressed him to be more candid; he then named the Na'im and the A1 Bu Shamis. His previous answers had suggested that he regarded the territory immediately beyond Abu Dhabi's frontiers as Muscat-owned territory, and I saw that Shaikh Shakhbut resented this. The Shaikh then asked me where I came in, and I explained that I should be accom panying the party to facilitate their passage in the interior. I also told him that the P.R. would be very pleased if he did something to assist the operations of the Company. 3. Shaikh Shakhbut then adjourned the meeting in order to consult Shaikh Khalifah, who had presumably been omitted from the Majlis in order to provide this excuse. 4. On the 18th November the same party r eturned in the forenoon. Shaikh Shakhbut pressed for further information about the places to b e visited by the geologists. Mr. Ler mitte named Dhank, Jebel Hafit and Jebel Faiyah. Shaikh Shakhbut was annoyed at not having had the whole visit arranged through him. He asked Mr. Lermitte point blank whether the visit had been arranged through Muscat and Mr. Lermitte replied 'yes'. Shaikh Shakhbut said that Muscat had no power there, and he hoped the Company had got a proper 'guarantee' from him. He could have fixed the whole thing, and given a guarantee. However, he said, it was a 'finished thing', and he finally agreed to the Company's proposal.5. Mr. Lermitte then mentioned the Company's wish for Mr, Williamson to s elect and mark out an aerodrome in Baraimi. Shaikh Shakhbut asked why he had not been told this last night, and Mr. Lermitte explained that it was not a matter of urgency, like the passage of the geologists. Shaikh Shakhbut asked if he would be paid, and was told it was as he chose to say. His conversation seemed to mention the Government rather than the Company, and I took an oppor tunity to explain to him that it was not an R.A.F. plane, but a Company plane, that was to land on the proposed aerodrome. 6. The Majlis then adjourned for prayer, but Shaikh Shakhbut promised to return that evening for further discussion. Abu Dhabi, Id/- J.H. 18/11/38.0 Memorandum of negotiations with Shaikh Shakhbut at Abu Dhabi on November 18th, 1938. Shaikh Shakhbut called after dinner, accompanied by his usual Majlis. 2. After civilities, Ahmad bin Khalaf informed Mr. Lermitte that Shaikh Shakhbut agreed to the Company siting an aerodrome in Baraimi Oasis, but wished to dis cuss terms, and the Company’s requirements. Mr. Lermitte mentioned guards, temporary accommodation for petrol and stores and facilities for marking boundaries etc. Shaikh Shakhbut enquired the period for which this aerodrome was required. Mr. Lermitte said that he could not definitely say the date on which the plane would arrive in Baraimi, but that its operations would not last more than 1 or 2 months; the total period for which the plane would be anywhere in the vicinity would not exceed 6 months. He hinted that any t emporary arrangement that might be arrived at now, could be replaced by a more permanent one when the concession was discussed. Shaikh Shakhbut appeared to be pleased by this. 3. Much fencing now ensured, neither party wishing to be Che first to name a figure. Finally Lermitte suggested Rs. 150/- p.ra. for the 6-month period. He pointed out that during most of this time the Company would be getting nothing for their money, but that this method would obviate any difficulty about dates. This proposal was met with a very definite refusal. Shaikh Shakhbut could not even be prevailed upon by Mb. Lemitte, with the assistance of Ahmad bin Khalaf, to name his own terms. After a very little while, he lost all interest in the matter (or feigned to), arid began breaking into small talk with me; and could only with difficulty be induced to listen to any further remarks on the main subject. He asked my leave to go. Ahmad bin Khalaf, who was anxious for a settlement, asked for more coffee, in an attempt to prolong the meeting*- 2 - but Shaikh Shakhbut was not even willing to wait for its preparation, and I saw we should get no further that night. 4. After his departure, I suggested to Mr. Lermitte that he should draw up a written agreement, in three parts (alternative) most of the clauses being identical, but the 'period” and 'payment' clauses distinct: as follows (i) From 1st Dhu'l Haj (19th January) to the end of Safar (16th March), a period of 3 months Rs. 1500/- or (ii) A period of 6 weeks to be selected by the Company, provided that the Shaikh was to have a fortnight’s notice of the arrival of the plane Rs. 1000/- p.m. or (iii) For 6 months from the date of signature Hs. 400/- down and Hs. 200/- per mensem.

We first got to Ibrahim bin Uthraan, ShakhbuVs man, who lives at A1 ’Ain, just on the east side of the northward end of the Jebel Hafit feature. I had better digress to explain that J. Hafit is a huge hog’s back, with two flanking ridges, one each side, running North from it. They run tino a mass of date gardens, which contains Mu’taredh (Shaikh Khalifah’s village), and A1 ’Ain (where Shakhbut stays when in the oasis). You then cross about a mile and a half of open tussocky plain, going N.E., until you come to another mass of gardens, containing Haraarah, Baraimi and Sa*arah; also Hili, Jimi (Sh. Ahmed bin Hilal’s house) and Gatarah (Sultan ad-Darmaki’s place). 3. I have seen nothing that looks anything like a landing ground, except a piece just outside A1 ’Ain. The plain east of J. Hafit is level enough; but it is so tussocky that it would take days of work to get it into any shape at all. However/-&lt; 3 &gt; - 2 - However, we have only had a most cursory glimpse of it so far. 4. Ibrahim bin Uthman told me that he had sent word to the Muscat party not to come into Abu Dhabi territory. I assured him that they would not in any case attempt to do so. He was very friendly in-his attitude; but said he could do nothing without Shakhbut’s orders; which of course we fully understand. As regards the extent of the Abu Dhabi territory, I have no doubt, as I see the situation at present, that they have got this oasis, and a large slice of the surrounding country, pretty well screwed down. Our Abu Dhabi guide, Shaikh Khalifah! man, as we approached J. Hafit from the West, pointed me out a feature just south of the crest of the hog’s back, which he said was the boundary of the Abu Dhabi haram, the line then running northwards down the ridge. But Ibrahim bin bthman claimed that all the plain E. of the Jebel, about 6—10 miles wide, up to the foot of the Oman range, is held by the Najadat, who are feudatory to Abu Dhabi. This, the Abu Dhabi claim. Against this, there are plenty of bedouin beside the Najadat using this plain, Awamir, Manasir and Beni Jabir (not to mention the Dhuwahir themselves). Saqr bin Sultan said i that the harams there are all •mixed up', and t v at ”he himself could not say what was his haram' ( a fairly obvious euphe mism). So I shall not be surprised to find the Abu Dhabi influence pretty strong on the east of the Jebel, as well as the west. 5. Now getting back to the sequence of events a bit: Ibrahim bin Uthman took Williamson and myself to see Saqr bin Sultan. I had something of a surprise when I saw his two villages, Baraimi and Sa’arah. I had imagined, from the map, that they were a mile or twoaprt, with a chance of a landing ground between. Actually, there is about 200 yards between them; and as Sh. Saqr made no claim to any sort of a haram, I conclude that he owns the two villages and the dategardens, and/-(ij; H « 3- and no more. However, he has allotted us a camp site for the night, just south of Baraimi. But when we mentioned the question of g etting on to Haf it and further south to morrow morning, it was a very different story. He made various excuses, one being that a motor could not get there - a most palpable untruth 5 for that matter, he later s aid the same about the road to Sharjah (i.e. Dhaid and the Beni Kitab country). What it means is that he cannot get us south. I shall go and see the A1 Bu Shamis man at Hamarah; but it looks to me as if we shall be unable to meet Thompson any where south of the oasis, and that for getting south at all, the only card in our hand is Mudhaffar. If he can get Thompson up here, he should be able to take us back. 6. A man came in with letters for Saqr from Mudhaffar and Saiyid Sa’id, while w e were there. He said that their party left Dhank this morning. 7. We had a beast of a journey, getting here, a day and a halt for 110 miles, with a bitterly cold night among the sandhills. However, here we are.

A few shots were fired into the air by a party of lawless Beduins as a signal to halt so that the question of passing through their district could be discussed. I said that it appeared that no control was exercised over these people by the local Shaikh and the Sultan said at Hail village there was no Shaikh or Headman. I asked the Sultan what he proposed to do in the natter and he replied he proposed to do nothing.

As I indicated in that letter, we found Shaikh Saar bin Sultan nomoletely unable to send us further south, the reason being, (i) his own weakness, both in men and in personality, (ii) his dread of Abu Dhabi, in the person of Shaikh Ibrahim bin Uthman, (iii) his enmity with the A1 Bu Shamis and all the rest of the Na’im. He As I said at the begin-5 is, in fact, rather a 'social outcast', ning. 5 H.W. 2. We therefore perforce stayed in Baraimi, feeling, as far as I myself was concerned, on a very unpleasant and rather fragile tight-rope, until Nov. 26th. Though this was naturally galling for the geologists, these three days were not entirely wasted. We have made many 'contacts' and gathered a lot of useful information. The Abu Dhabi people are all, personally, most friendly and likeable; but their loyalty to Shak but is tremendous, and they evidently have strict orders from him about us. However, Sh. Ibrahim bin Uthman is really going out of his way to be friendly , and has even offered to accompany us in person if we want to pass through the Abu Dhabi haram. (In this connection, I have a suggestion to offer, which I will reserve for the moment). Beside Shaikh Saqr, Shaikh Ibrahim and Shaikh Sultan ad-Darmaki (Sh.Ahmad bin Hilal is sick at Abu Dhabi, and I met him there), we also 'contacted' the Ai Bu Shamis. At first,when I sent word that I would like to call, he said he did not wish to meet us (because, of course, we are here under Sh. Saqr*s protection). But after I had got a little indirect pressure to bear on him, he repented and invited us. His cousin, Sh. Abdul Aziz bin Sultan, wants to go to Bahrain for medical treatment, and I am giving him letters to the R.A.and to Hoomes. I have also asked him to call and see you while he is there* 3. On Nov. 26th, guides came in from the Wali, who was at Hafit. Williamson, Rogers and I packed light kit, and went off to Hafit in two cars (the guides made difficulties about one taking four, and I foresee further trouble in this direction, due to (i) suspicion and fear of foreign inventions and machinery, (ii) vested interests of camel-owners). We made the trip in an hour and a quarter (the road being - according to Sh. Saqr - impassable by motors!), and met Thompson and Hotchkiss at Hafit. We kept, I noticed, well clear of the N. end of the mountain, where the Abu Dhabi villages lie, and then gradually came in, towards the South. /.

(A I fruSAoimi*) Ibrahim bin Uthman &gt; claims that we went through Abu Dhabi haram, but I think his claim is b^sed merely on the right of the stronger, and that de .jure the plain between J.

He is always friendly and courteous; says that he is making no fuss 'out of regard for me', and that if we let him know, next time we want to go South, he himself will come and see us through. (No doubt, he is also anxious to see what we do when we get South; but we have no reason to be secretive about that). 4. Yesterday morning the geologists geologised on the South end of J. Hafit, and we returned to Baraimi with Thomp- al so son and Hotchkiss in the afternoon. The Wali xtox came in a few hours later, with his accompanying horde.

Under strict orders from Shakhbut, but apparently prepared even to stretch a point in order to help us. Na’im (Saqr) Though individually ineffective, may derive sufficient strength from the presence of Mudhaffar to get us to Jebel Aqda (one of the Oman foot-hills about 5 miles due East of Baraimi, which Williamson would like to see). Mudhaffar Is apparently trying to deny any responsibility for the second party (ours), either by way of taking us to points South, or taking motors anywhere. He has written to the Sultan for orders, and Thompson intends to visit the latter when he gets back to Muscat, and to do his best to ensure that the correct reply is sent. Williamson thinks that the Wali may require further 'sweetening' and is prepared to do so. It seems to me to be a most unfortunate factor in the Company* s policy that not even Thompson or Williamson (let alone the Political Department*.) are informed of how much Longrigg paid out at Muscat, and precisely for what services in return. Two *-*+*i*~*- Hiiriiigfiimfri - I' liriir - rtf* - » . ^ rm Ml - *r »• -/• ■****+*—*- -c-w*-* things are fairly clear -- (i) that the merest fraction of the original sum has so far reached the Shaikhs from whom facilities are required; (ii) that we could have bought our way from point to point with half the trouble and probably one tenth of the money. However, I am perhaps taking a very per sonal and parochial point of view on this matter; and certainly what is done cannot be undone. Beni Kitab You will have better information on this subject from the Residency Agent, than I am able to give you. Sh. Mohd. bin Sultan (the Na*im man from Dhank) has gone off to try to-4- Quite pos sible but I hope not* H.W. Of cour si he would{ H.W.{ 5 to mediate between Sharjah and Mohd. bin All. One other point is that I have heard that while we were away at Hafit, 3 some Beni Kitab men came in to Baraimi, and said that Mohd. 3 bin Ali had remarked that now there were ^asrani’s in Baraimi, 3 he was going to fade into the landscape’ 1 . It doesn*t sound too good, from the point of view of our eventual exit from Baraimi; but I am fairly confident that I could get Ibrahim bin Uthman to send us to Abu Dhabi, if it did come to the worst. 6. You will perhaps be surprised that I have made no men tion of a landing ground in the foregoing paragraphs. We -i t i iifm r -- avwe-i have so far not broached the matter (Williamson is entirely in agreement with me), for various reasons:- (i) It would have been unwise to open the question until the local people have to some extent ,, digested ,, us; (ii) It would be difficult, if not impossible, to find a place in the oasis, outside the Abu Dhabi haram, which would not bring a hornet’s nest of boundary questions about our ears; (iii) we suspect that the price asked in Abu Dhabi is fairly well-known here; (iv) there is a perfect natural site just South of Falaj-al-Jabil, in A1 Bu Shamis territory. This is 20 miles south of Baraimi, so would knock 40 miles off each day’s trip. (b) I might add that it was quite well-known among the Shaikhs accompanying the Muscat party that we want a landing ground, and I suppose astronomical figures have already been decided upon. I thought th6 matter was to have been kept confidential; but the cat is already well and truly out of the bag. 7. I now come to the suggestion which I mentioned in my second paragraph. You will have seen from my memoranda of the negotiations at Abu Dhabi that I did not make use of the - fXrrzTc ' 8 ' ’’travel facilities” argument (your telegram No. 184 of 15th November). The reasons were (i) that permission for the journey to Baraimi was obtained without difficulty, and (ii)that it never looked like having a decisive effect in the aerodrome negotiations* (In fact, the wording of your tele gram did not authorise me to use it for this purpose). From the experience of my few days in Abu Dhabi, I am convinced that it has little weight as a bargaining counter, 90% of Abu Dhabi’s trade and communications being with Dubai or Persia. But as a gesture of friendship or a symbolical reward for services rendered, it has a value. I venture therefore to suggest that if Sh. Ibrahim bin Uthman makes good his offer to help us to g et South again, and waives to that extent the exorbitant Abu Dhabi territorial claims, Sh. Shakhbut may be informed that the travel facilities are being restored in return for Sh. Ibrahim’s assistance to me. (I suggest that it should be put like that, rather than mentioning the Company, which would make the act seem like a cheap avoidance of a money payment). Sh. Shakhbut will then have no outstanding grievance (a) for the concession negotiations, and (b) if the Beni Kitab fail us, and we have to get out of Baraimi through his territory. 8. I have a good deal of other miscellaneous information, but it will go best into my final report. In any case, I may already say, like St.Paul, 'Ye see how long an epistle I have written unto you with mine own hand'• 9. I hope everything is prospering in Bahrain: Yours sincerely, Sd/- J. B. Howes.Confidential ( ph Dated the 4th December 1938 D.O. No. C/739-25/4 My dear Howes, Many thanks for your reports, of which I have now received four, the last being dated the 28th November 1938. I found them extremely interesting and I am passing them on to the Political Resident as they arrive. 2. I was much relieved when you induced Abu Dhabi to trke you through to Raraimi, and he seems to have behaved very decently about it. Naturally he is out to loot the Oil Company as much as he can over the aerodrome, but I imagine that if the worst comes to the worst the Company will be able to manage somehow without an aerodrome at all in the interior. I agree that there has been far too much talk about this aerodrome, but that after all is the Company^ affair, and we ourselves are not responsible. 3. There are one or two points about your last letter of the 28th November which 1 want to discuss. In the first place, as you probablykiow now, Longrigg paid nothing on behalf of P.C.L. in Muscat. Such payments as were made to the various Shaikhs, (and I expect they were the minimum possible sums), were made by the Sultan himself. I do not expect that Longri-g will be over-anxious to let Williamson spend a great deal of money, but I have no doubt that he will authorise Williamson to spread a certain amount about, and I hope that this will remove the more serious impediments to your free movements. 4. Secondly it is not quite clear to me why your party came back to Baraimi from Hafit. I do not doubt that this decision was taken by the geologists, but it seems to me to be/- Captain J. B. Howes, Baraimi.- 2 - Gsj) v be a great pity that they did decide so. For some reason best known to themselves P.C.L. seem to want Williamson to do all the geologising (flown south, and obviously every mile south that your party could get was so much to the good. It seems therefore a pity to have retraced your steps even for so short a distance as that from Hafit to Barairai. Incidentally do you hanpen to know what geologising, if any, the Thompson party did on its way up? They se^m to have come at such a speed that they cannot have done a very great deal, and I should be interested to know why things were rushed quite so much. Of course I realise that they want to get on with the aerial survey down Has al Hedd way, but even so it seems a little curious that having got into the Yankul-Dhank-Ibri area they should not have taken the fullest advantage of it. Perhaps, however, they did and came to the conclusion that it was not much use. 5. I am thinking over your suggestion about the restora tion of travel facilities for Abu Dhabi and shall send some recommendation across to the Political Resident next week. Incidentally I do not think you need anticipate the least difficulty in getting back from Baraimi to Abu Dhabi if the Beni Kitab let us down, for the Shaikh and his Baraimi rep- resentative will be only too pleased to help you to get outl 6. So far there have been no d evelopments so far as the Beni Kitab are concerned, Shaikh Mohammad bin All being out of touch on the excuse of settling some Awamir raiders who have killed one of his men. This may or may not be an excuse for avoiding a meeting; this we shall discover later. 7. I hope that you are not having too uncomfortable a time and that you are managing to induce some of the local folk to take you out shooting, ihe more of that you can do, the/--v -3- the better; for one always finds that local people are apt to be a good deal more expansive after a successful morning with a gun.

As you will see the Baraimi-Hafit-Dhahira exploration has failed. I always had an uncomfortable feeling that Muscat and Abu Dhabi aspirations would clash and that the exploration programme might fail for this reason; and from Howes* reports it seems this is exactly what has happened. Abu Dhabi’s in fluence over the Na'im and the A1 Bu Shamis is at least as strong as was expected and the Shaikh has not been paid to use it favourably. All the same I had expected that the geo logists would do better than this with the Na* im and the A1 Bu Shamis if they rattled the rupees in their pockets, and it looks to me as if they have not rattled them sufficiently loudly. 3. I cannot say I was enamoured of Howes* suggestion in paragraphs 4 to 6 of his letter of the 7th December 1938 which he repeats in paragraph 4 of his letter of the 9th Decem ber, but that suggestion does not require detailed consideration now as the impression I gather from reports coming from Longrigg to Packer is that the Baraimi party is returning via Abu Dhabi. In fact they should be back in Sharjah any day now. I had a telegram/- Honourable Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Trenchard Fowle, K.C.I.E., C.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire(3P telegram from the Residency Agent that Mohammad bln Sultan of Dhank had stated openly that he was about to attack the party in Baraimi village (you will remember he is the brother of Shaikh Saqr bin Sultan of Baraimi), and as the decision to abandon the interior exploration had already been taken I sent a letter to Longrigg yesterday by a P*C*L. plane which was passing through, asking him to ensure that the party left Baraimi at once* I dare say that the attack would never have come off, but there was no point in taking any risk as no object would be served by the Baraimi party waiting there* 4. As for the Beni Kitab situation, the Residency Agent’s report gives a good idea of the volume of intrigue that is going on. I do not entirely give up hope yet of access to the Beni Kitab country in general and to Jebel Faiyah in particular, though it is highly improbable that a party will be able to get in even via Dhaid (Shaikh Khalid's village) before late February or early March. The fact is that we were not given sufficient notice of the Company’s plans, and the result was that negotiations through Shaikh Khalid started far too late. As it is there is nothing much we can do except to prod Shaikh Khalid from time to time. We are in no position to put a stop to all these intrigues from the Coast as we have no subsidies to withdraw and no force to use. 5. I am afraid these reports make depressing reading but I do not think that the outlook is completely black. Our knowledge is a great deal more extensive than it was; there is still a faint prospect of doing Jebel Faiyah this year and it should be easier to work out plans for next year. I have written to Howes telling him, when he arrives in Sharj ah/--3- Sharjah, to see what the prospects are of expediting access to the Beni Kitab country if he stays down there himself. Meanwhile I understand that Longrigg is to have consultations with the geologists of both partiesj before coining to any provisional decision about a fresh attempt to get into the Hafit Yankul-Dhank^ area from the Batineh Coast, I have had no letter from him recently, but I gather that he is not parti cularly keen on this idea himself. I am writing to him, suggesting that if he has time he might come up and have a talk about the whole situation in Bahrain, for after all it will not be far off Christmas by the time he has met all the geologists. Also you will want information as soon as possible about future plans. 6. I shall await Howes* final report before attempting to assess fully the reasons for the failure to push through the programme, but meanwhile I may say that the following seem to me to be the main factors (1) Abu Dhabi hostility to attempted extension of Muscat influence between Dhank and Baraimij (2) The Oil Company’s rather parsimonious methods; (3) Intensive intrigue from the Coast. (I will attempt later to show in detail how this has grown and the effects it has had). 7. Should the decision be taken to make a fresh start from Sohar or elsewhere on the Batineh Coast I assume that Howes should not accompany the party in view of the Sultan* s objections to a Political Officer accompanying any party in an area over which he enjoys presumptive sovereignty. If this is so, and if Howes reports that he can do nothing to expedite the successful outcome of negotiations with Mohammad bin Ali, I propose, subject to your approval, to recall him to Bahrain. Yours sincerely,Saatiltami Copy Baraimi y Dec. 5th. W38 Dear Mr. Weightman, I am afraid that I cannot report very cheerfully on P.C.L's prospects. Thompson and Hotchkiss left us on Nov. 30th by the Wadi Jizzi for Sohar. Saqr made certain difficulties about our taking them to his frontier in the cars, but these were overcome. It was when we sent him word that Williamson wished to start work the next morning (which we expected him to agree to as a matter of course, l ' ■ n ur^fci i n J tY if *t*am*t*P9**'~ v*™'* particularly in view of the presence of the Wall with us) that the trouble began. He made various objections, and it was quite clear that he had not been adequately squared by Muscat and needed more sweetening. We had a talk with pay out anything. Williamson decided that, as the expedi tion costs the Company about Rs. 250/- a day for time wasted, it was sounder to put up a little than to waste yet more time. The Wall did the negotiating, and eventually secured the agreement of which I enclose a copy. (Knowing Saqr*s slippery ways, we had it reduced to writing and signed; and it has subsequently proved to be just as well that we did so). 2. I must confess that I was not a little relieved when we got this agreement, as considerable pressure was being brought to bear on Saqr (who is as weak as water) to turn us out of his haram? which would have been an extremely unpleasant position, as we should/had nowhere to go but into Abu Dhabi territory, where Ibrahim bin Uthman would have given us sanctuary. But this was exactly what Abu Dhabi wants. Incidentally, one Mohammad bin Gbal, a chief of the Manasir, is an agent of Shakhbut’s, apparently entrusted with the task of putting stones into the machinery. We don’t quite know how to deal with him: have- 2 - we sent him to Abu Dhabi with letters once, but he was back in 5 days. 3. You will see that I said that if Saqr had turned us out, we had nowhere to go. The position at present is briefly this:* (i) Beni Ka^b Will have us on camels, but not in cars. Their territory proves to e xtend much further south than I had anticipated, very nearly to the latitude of Baraimi. It seems to be a long narrow strip along the foothills, between the plain and the high stuff; and it marches with Saqr's territory. (The latter extends only a few kilo metres into the foothills, and not in any considerable depth). Williamson is naturally unwilling to agree to abandon his carsiike this, at the very outset, especially as our doing so will merely give the people to the South a further opportunity for obstructionism; but it looks at the moment as if we have no other course open to us, if we are to keep moving. Obeid bin Tuma seems a very decent sort of fellow, and was quite straightforward with me about his reasons for not allowing the cars in, viz. that his people are hostile to the cars and he cannot control them sufficiently to accept responsibility for our safety. Previously, we had asked him to go back and try to fix things in the course of the next month; but it now looks as if we diall have to go in on camels owing to the attitude of the A1 Bu Shamis and As-Salf ♦ (ii) Beni Kitab Nothing to report, but I gather that negotiations have not yet begun. (iii) A1 Bu Shamis and As - 3 alf (I take these together, as Sh. Ahmad in majlis merely sits back and agrees with Mohd. bin Rahmah. Also-3- I gather that their harams are undefined as far as Tebel Hafi is concerned, so that the Company will obviously have to square both, or neither). The position is that strenuous negotiation, principally done through the Wali, who seems to be pretty good at the job when he chooses, have produced no answer but 'We do not want the Company; we do not want oil; we do not want money; we prefer to live on our camels and dates'. Later, they have said that they cannot do any more until they have been to Muscat and seen the Sultan. As the Sultan leaves for Dhofar in these days, and will be there, I understand, for 35 days; and as the Shaikhs will certainly sit about for 10 or 12 days when they do get there, this is not too good an answer. They are all saying that they have 'done their part' by bringing Thompson and Hotchkiss through, and recently the Wali and Saqr have been taking up the same tune. Luckily we have got the latter tied up; but the Wali seems to be walking out on us, and this morning has declined to send a message to catch the Sultan before he goes, asking him to send definite instructions, either to him or to the Southern Shaikhs. (You will have noted that the Muscat people are no straighten than the rest* from the fact that the Wali paid out 400 dollars and a camel to Saqr after telling us that he could make no payments). 4. At the moment, I ^am frankly not able to give any simple answer to the problem of why these two Shaikhs are turning away good money (which they both need), uut in the way they are doing. In fact, I do not think their motives are simple, but composed of a blend of various factors. I will examine the situation as I see it, as briefly as I can, as this may clarify the policy we are to adopt for the future t- (a) Two Br i tish parties on top of each other The brains of the local nobility and gentry are no quicker than they might be; their suspicions are easily aroused, and allayed with difficulty. The Company’s planhas been too complex* and they are mentally defeated by it. Also, they undoubtedly dislike penetration, and think we aredbing things on altogether too large a scale. They were warned of one party (only, according to them); and that party has used up all the ,, good-will f, and there is none left for us. It is most unfortunate that Thompson and Hotchkiss should have come through to Baraimi, especially as, I gather, they did no useful work after leaving the hills. (b) The cars . The chief objection is, I now think, that they make the geologists too independent and mobiles. They can get miles away in no time, and do their dirty work out of direct observation (except by a few guards). People are wanting to know the 'objects' of the Company (and one can hardly reply, I think, 'to examine your territory without paying for an option'*.) Also, as I said in my last letter, conservatisms and vested interests play a large part. (c) Respect for the Sultan One would not expect this to come in much; but I have it from a very reputable source that the two Shaikhs have had no orders from the Sultan about our party, and are afraid to let us (especially with motors) come in without his sanction. Although the Sultan has no direct authority in the Dhahira, there seems tobe a great deal of cordial umiw^h —— .i ni*&gt;—mriwiiiinc.)i in i mjwi immhii mrjyii &gt;i 'WMwimn.i -T- .-xn u ran r tmricru* r feeling almost amounting to loyalty, towards him (possibly _ .. . - • ■■ - - ' ■ ■ • - • ' - . . — • as a set off to Abu Dhabi ambitions); and I have been surprised at the prestige of Mudhaffar, considering that he is the son of a slave. Certainly the Shaikhs find it financially convenient to stand inw ell with the Sultan; and, I think, also find it advisable to keep friendly with the power that controls the Batineh. So I do not dismiss this as a possible factor; though I am much more tempted to think that the Shaikhs are waiting to go down and see what sort of presents they get in return for their help up to-5- &amp; €) date (Saiyid Shahab, the Sultan^ uncle, has got the presents ready for them)* before they consider doing any more. (&lt;*) Objection to Muscat protection The foregoing paragraph more or less deals with this. I think the Shaikhs are too secure of their de facto indepen dence to worry much about this. (e) The_examples of Kuwait and Dubai I do not think anyone here thinks hard enough to see the connection with oil concessions and increased revenue. Lack of control by the Shaikhs over their peopls Obeid bin Juma* admits this; but I set out to ecamine the position only as regards as-Salf and A1 Bu Shamis. Obeid bin Juma 1 has a wilder country (and probably, people) to control; but he seems a stronger man. I should say that the extent of this factor is that the Shaikhs know that, whatever figure they may accept, they will have to distribute a good deal of it. Mohammad bin Rahmah has already stated that he needs Bs. 200A to pacify his bedouin for the Thompson-Hotchkiss visit. (g) The presence of a political officer I have taken some pains to gauge whether this is an objection, as I am - perhaps wrongly - rather touchy at being regarded in certain quarters as the fly in the Ointment l I am mow quite satisfied that it is not the stumbling block, particularly so as both as-Salf and Mohammad bin Rahmah have separately come to me to ask me to intermediate to get them a present from Williamson. So the Political is less formidable than the Company, which is just what I had expected. 5. This being the present position, we have, as far as the south is concerned, just one more card to play, namely whatever Thompson may be able to get out of the Sultan when he gets to Muscat. If he is unlucky, we san do Beni Ka^b country on camels, and hope that Ahmad as-Salf and Mohammad bin Rahmah will have a satisfactory talk with the Sultan when he returns from Dofar. The Wali thinks there will be nodifficulty with Mohammad bin Sultan or the people further south* The delay will not be too bad if the Beni Kitab can be fixed. 6. It is grac'd f working with Williamson, as he is so very reasonable about everything. I hope all is well at your end, and that the C-in~C*a visit was a success. Yours sincerely, Sd/- «!• B.

For this purpose the Company shall pay to the Shaikh the sum of ten daily dollars/for guards, as long as they remain encamped in his territory. 3. The Company is permitted to camp in any part of the Shaikh’s territory. 4. The Company is permitted to pass through the Shaikh territory in their motor cars, whenever it is necessary. 5. The Wali agrees to pay the Shaikh the sum of four hundred dollars, and to allow the Shaikh to select one of his camels (except the Wall’s own riding camel). 6. The Company agrees to pay the Shaikh a sum of four hundred dollars for the above facilities.Copy, Confidential Baraimi, Dec. 7th, 1938 O' &amp; Dear Mr. Weightmzn, Williamson has had to hold up the post camel a day, so I am opening a fresh letter which may keep you informed up to date. 2. The A 1 Su Shamis — As-Salf position is unchanged. I hear that Mohammad bin All wrote to Saqr bin Sultan, promising him alliance and friendship if he refused to come to terms with us; fortunately he has already done so. The Beni Ka’ab country on camels seems to be all that is left. *■ . | ^ ^ , 1 , I j, miV nr.wi ui.]i- ■ ir i-—r-n~irr-n»i mmwmum i if I have talked to the Wall, who is of opinion that we should in the first place go only as far as Mahadhah, where we shall meet M the Shaikhs ,, , including Hamdan bin Salim bin Diyen, who after all the nominal chief. This seems sound, and may possibly lead to an understanding about the cars. 3. Williamson meanwhile h-s to consider the oroblem of sending away two of his cars, and keeping two merely for getting about on geological work, while camp is moved by camels. Thompson *nd Hotchkiss need two cars for the South Coast; and it is unsound for the company to buy more cars for them, while ours are here useless (or practically so). We contemplated sending them down the Wadi Jizzi to Sohar, but I gather from the Wall that there are obstacles near Hail which need dynamitel So it means negotiating with Ibrahim bin Uthman for their passage to Dubai. 4. I have suggested to Williamson the following plan, if A1 Bu Shamis and As-Salf are still obdurate after we have done Beni Ka’abt— Leave the two cars in Baraimi with their drivers (this means 10 dollars a day to Saqw by the agreement, but no matter). Go down the W.Jizzi to Sohar by camels and along the Batineh to Saham. The Wali can meanwhile go to Muscat by car, and try to get Saiyid Shahab to come with us and bring his influence to bear on Mohammad bin Hahmah- 2 - and Ahmad as-^alf* In any case^ we move up the W # Ahin over the pass and along the W.Dhank to v a nqul, where the Beni All are very friendly to Muscat. From here the geologists can see Jebel Abyadh and Jebel Khatin, both of which interest them. 5. I discussed the practicability of this plan with Mudhaffar before broaching it to Williamson, and he was very keen on it. He said that once we get to Yanqul, we should have the country 'by the throat'. Williamson is thinking ove~ the idea, and probably will consult Longrigg. If successful, we could then negotiate to get the cars down to meet us, with good (or better) prospects of success. 6. I should mention the one objection which I see to this plan, namely that Thompson and Hotchkiss were held up and made m pay 85 dollars for their passage through the Beni Gfrieith terri tory at the head of the wadi. Lower down, they say they were 'fired on': but I don’t suppose it was an aimed shot (but merely the local dialect for 'Heave a minute, I should like to have a chat with you'), as they were not asked to pay anything when they did atop. I took up this question with the Wall, who expressed great indignation, as the usual 'tariff', he says, is about 15 dollars at the most. He is apparently going to take steps (though, what steps ? I do not know) to recover the excess; and says that he can very easily get us through if he has a day in which to send letters in advance. At the moment however he has been asked to keep it all to himself, until the Company decide their plan of action. 7. I gather both from Thompson and from the Wall, that Saqr was behind the blackmailing business. 8. I am now closing the mail, but may add that there are now some reasons to think that W.Jizzi can be traversed by cars. 9. There are plenty of sandgrouse about|* but you can’t get near them on this open plain. Anyway, I have only got buckshot 1 Yours sincerely, Sd/- J. B. Howes.Copy Confidential Qaraimi t Dec. 9th, 1938 Dear Mr. Weightman, To-day we have received definite word from Obeid bin Juma that the Beni Ka’ab territory is closed to the P.C.L. party, even on camels. The man sent by the Wall, a leading member of the Beni Um, did not even succeed in seeing Shaikh Hamdan bin Salim; he was told that he was away, but I suspect this was an excuse. Obeid bin Juma says that the Shaikhs will not consent to the entry of 'Nasara'; and that it was they who killed his father, brother and uncle, and made him Shaikh. He clearly cannot do anything with them. Of course, they have had Nasara in their territory before; but I suppose they have never before seen commercial penetration so close behind the Nasara. 2. Abu Dhabi have produced another move in getting a Shaikh of the Najadat, whose territory is reputed to stretch from Thumaid, a point on Jebel Hafit, to Raddat as-Sa f , in the hills across the plain, to declare himself (in a letter to Ibrahim bin Uthman) under Abu Dhabi protection, thereby making it necessary for us to get Abu Dhabi permission before moving South. Mohammad bin Salmin and Ahmad as-Saif are understood to claim that the Najadat are subject to them; and the Wall says that this Shaikh, Mohammad by name, controls only one of three divisions of the Najadat, aid has no right to speak for all. I am not at present doing any thing about this, as we cannot get South in any case, owing to the attitude of the A1 Bu Shamis and as-Salf. I am fa'rly positive now that the real reason for the obduracy of these two is that they have been threatened by Abu Dhabi with enmity, if nothing more, if they let us in; and want to see the Sultan himself in order either that he my guarantee them against Abu Dhabi, or that they may be able t o represent to Abu Dhabi that they acted under instructions from Muscat, if they let us in. Abu Dhabi*s objects are presumably twofold (i) a counterblast to Muscat, (ii) to put up their own value for concession nego tiations.- 2 - 3* We do not at present know anything about the Beni Kitab negotiations, but as Mohd. bin All has written to Saqr telling him to stop the party’s operations (they finished all they can do, to-day), I am not hopeful. W« have also not heard from Muscat since Thompson got there. 4 . Williamson is writing to Lon^rigg to suggest withdrawing if there is no hope from the Beni Kitab. I feel that if we merely withdraw the way we came, through Abu Dhabi territory* it will have a most unfortunate effect on the concession negotiations, and so suggest for your consideration the plan of moving to Sohar via Wadi Jizzi* (On my map , this is not named, but it runs into the sea between Fasiqah and Sallan) The Wali is positive that there w ill be no political diffi culties; and though I cannot get certain information about the fitness of the tract for motors, we can always reconnoitre it as we go through on camels, and let the drivers bring the cars later, if it Is practicable. 5 # However, it is up to the Company to decide this; but I put the idea before you in case you may find it of any use when Longrigg consults you, as I presume he will do, about the present position.

Khalid returned to Ajman last night. I went to him this morning and asked him about the result of his _ jrnawi'Vimrr i ~~ if discussions with Muhammad bin All of the Beni Kitab tribe. He looked worried and disgusted. He said that he talked to Muhammad bin All for three days. The persons present at the meeting were, Rashid bin Hula is and his brother Khalifah Ali bin Abdullah bin Huwaidin and Abdullah bin Khalifah bin Huwaidi. Muhammad constantly asked Khalid to wait until he had the chance of consulting all the leaders of the Beni Kitab tribe and studied the whole situation. 3. Rashid bin Hulais of the Masa'id sub-section of the Beni Kitab came to Ajman with Khalid. I told Khalid that if he had no objection I wanted to speak to Rashid . Khalid called Rashid bin Hulais and I asked him as to why Muhammad bin Ali did not agree to the meeting. Rashid said that Muhammad had no bad intentions but wanted time to consider matters which, from the tribal point of view, were toital and of great importance. He said that Muhamnad was not left at his own but various news were being con veyed to him by different people. That he did not want to do anything before he was sure that he was doing the right thing. I said to Rashid bin Hulais that during our lifetime we continue to hear various rumours which are being circulated by people according to their whims. That false news had always been the cause of suspicions between friends and instead of bringing them together kept them apart. That 40 years ago both he and his late father accomoanied the late Sir Percy Cox to Buraimi and then to Batinah and as such was in a better position2 - to understand matters from which his fellow tribesmen would benefit. In order to remove all misdoubts f*om the mind of Muhammad bin Ali it would be better that he himself should meet us when we would e xplain everything to him personally. To achieve this end I asked Rashid to return at once to Muhammad bin Ali and explain what I said to him and try to fix the meeting. Rashid agreed to go back to Muhanmad and try once more to convince him about the meeting. 4. In the course of talk, Shaikh Khalid hinted that Muhammad bin Ali had been the victim of lot of intrigues and getting various news at which he had lost his sense of proportion. He said that recently he had received news to the effect that he was going to be trapped and should be careful. Khalid did not want to d isclose the names of the persons connected, but said that Muhammad was getting news from all over the Coast. I however managed to extract from him and some other source the followings- or (a) On nut about the 26th November, Muhammad bin Sultan an-Nua’imi who a ccompanied the Muscat Party as far as Sunainah south of Jabal Hafit, visited Ibrahim bin Utham, the Wali of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi at *Ain (Buraimi). He arrived at Dhaid on 1st December and spent two nights there waiting for Muhammad bin Ali. On 3rd December he left Dhaid in search for Muhammad bin Ali and while on his way to Dhaid he met him at Nubaibigh which is four miles west of Dhaid. Muhammad binSultan brought a letter with him from Ibrahim bin Uthman, Wali of Abu Dhabi at ^in to Muhammad bin Hi. He had a private talk with Muhammad bin All. Muhammad bin Sultan said to Muhammad bin Ali that he was at loss to see that his brother Saqr bin Sultan of Buraimi village had allowed the 'Nasara' (Christians) to camp at his place. He added that the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi did not allow them to do any work in his country. Muhammad bin Ali said to Muhammad bin Sultan that he could not understand why he criticised his-3- brother, Saqp, when he himself welcomed their visit and allowed them to go r ound his country* Muhammad bin Sultan made lame excuses that they visited Dhank as guests and thus he could not tell them to go away* Muhammad bin Sultan then asked Muhammad bin All if he would alow him to act as mediator in the dispute between him and Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr of Sharjah. Muhammad bin All told him that he should mind his own business* When Muhammad bin All went to Dhaid he asked the clerk of Shaikh Khalid, Ali bin Amir, to read the letter which Muhammad bin Sultan gave to him at Nubaibigh, The contents of the letter were to the effect that the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi did not allow the geologists to work in his country and that they (Abu Dhabi) were sticking to their former promise (policy D* Muhammad bin Sultan arrived at Sharjah on 5th, went to Ajman on 7th and returned to Sharjah on 9th* Muhammad bin Sultan was attempting to capture Buraimi village from his brother Saqr but owing to the presence of the geologists he did not succeed* (b) About the 30th November, Salim bin Mussabbih a pearl merchant of Dubai went out hawking and met Muhammad bin Ali 6 ut in the desert. He told Muhammad that he should be careful and should not be deceived about the Oil Company by anyone.

They also wrote that they did not enter into any agreement with the oil com pany. They wrote the above without being asked toy Muhammad bin Ali. 5. On 27th November the Shaikh of Ajman arrived at Sharjah and after spending four hours with the Shaikh, he went to Dubai and spent the rest of the day and whole night. He left for Abu Dhabi early on 29th. On the night of the 30th November he arrived at Sharjah and stayed with the Shaikh until 4 p.ra. when he left for Ajman, He said that he went to Abu Dhabi on a friendly visit and not for any business. When Shaikh Abdullah arrived at Ajman on the night of 5th December Shaikh Rashid bin Humaid went Ahmad bin Lutah at about 12 p.m. to the Shaikh of Sharjah in his lorry. Early on 6th December, the Secretary of the Shaikh of Sharjah went to Umm al Oaiwain to see Shaikh Ahmad bin Rashid but he did not get him as he was out hawking. The Secretary of the Shaikh of Sharjah told me that he went there to see if the Shaikh of Uram al Oaiwain would help them in the matter of Beni Kitab. 6 . It is evident that Muhammad bin Ali of the Beni Kitab Vi »i»iwh, i,.., , “'tfWWWnrjao* 1 J«W«il&gt; was not acting entirely on his own initiative but had been mis- guided by others. I suspect the Shaikh of Sharjah to be at v^_ V i u ^ iiwiuhi iiiiwmwwh mi &gt;u «i T - ^ f m m nr m o'***' s ; * w; '» the bottom of all this. Prom the comings and goings between these states it was easy to be seen that Abu Dhabi, Ajman and Sharjah had combined and were consulting and discussing much among themselves, more particularly in respect of the visit of the geologists to the interior which they consider as being of common interest to all of them. Copy to the Assistant Political Agent,Bahrain, at Buraimi.Confidential V 4 /i f No. C/793-25/4 Political Agency, Bahrain, the 23rd December 1938 From H. Weightman, Esquire, I.C.S Political Agent, Bahrain To The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Subject :- Petroleum Concessions Limited*s exploration in the Trucial Coast Hinterland. I have the honour to forward herewith a copy of an admirable brief report submitted by Captain Howes, Assistant Political Agent, Bahrain, describing the journey he made in company with one of Petroleum Concessions Limited^ geological parties, noting on the country and people, and estimating the causes for the failure of the venture. 2. My own comments should, I think, be confined to the last point, namely the reasons why the plans for geological exploration in the hinterland have failed. While I am far from questioning the importance of the contributory causes mentioned by Captain Howes in his last paragraph, I think that there have been other predominant factors. It will be well to distinguish between the two substantially separate parts of the exploration programme, namely that in the Baraimi- Hafit-Dhahira area, and that in the Beni Kitab country between Baraimi and Dhaid. 3. In regard to the former the determining factors have Sir Ux-#s P-L. i&gt;)o . U&gt;Ti“- S-d* . Uii-S'd - i | iT | &lt;7 (i)A OS, &lt;i*L4- been:-- 2 - JUL) the clash of Interest between Abu Dhabi and Muscat; (ii) the failure of the Company to distribute adequate —- monetary presents; and (iii) the over-elaboration of the Company 1 s plans. It will be remembered that the original plan, as described In India Office demi-official letter 111. P.Z. 5785/38 dated the 20th August 1938, was for a party of geologists to work up from the Muscat side towards Baraimi, and there to be met by a second motorised unit, the combined party then moving northwards towards the Coast (through the Beni Kitab country). The actual plan attempted was for one party of geologists to proceed rapidly from the Batineh Coast via Ibri and Yanqul to Baraimi, where the second party accom panied by Captain Howes had arrived a few days earlier; and it was then intended that the second party should proceed in a southerly direction, apparently over much the same route as the first party but conducting more detailed geo logical exploration. Meanwhile the first party was to pro ceed to the Batineh Coast at Sohar. What actually occurred was that the Sultan of Muscat made arrangements for the first party to be conducted rapidly up to Baraimi; he paid out small sums of money to the Shaikhs through whose terri tories the party was to proceed, those sums (as far as I can ascertain) approximating to the normal charge for safe conduct in transit of the 'haram' of any particular tribe; and in fact that party passed through at the maximum speed of their camels, seeing practically nothing, but exhausting the good-will for which the Sultan of Muscat had paid. Meanwhile insufficient time had been allowed for arrangements to be made with the Beni Kitab for the Williamson-Howes party to proceed to Baraimi through Beni Kitab country, (it is needless to elaborate the argument that such negotiations take/-take not days or weeks but months)* They therefore had to proceed to Baraimi with the aid and protection of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, No payment was made for this service, but unfortunately simultaneous negotiations with the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi for a landing ground near Baraimi broke down owing to the extravagant demands made by the Shaikh. Nego tiations for a concession in Abu Dhabi were still pending, and consequently the atmosphere in Abu Dhabi at the time when the Williamson-Howes party left was one of unsatisfied greed and of resentment that a second party was approaching Baraimi from the south under Muscat auspices through the territory of tribes which for many years have been under strong Abu Dhabi influence. How then did all these forces react on the Na* im, A1 Bu Shamis and other tribes such as the Beni Ka*ab? Their mental background is well depicted in Captain Howes' Conclusions. They had performed the ser vice for which they had been paid by the Sultan of Muscat and they saw no further large sums of money coming their way; they were nervous of Abu Dhabi and only too ready to listen to any hints that it would be better for them to do no more. They therefore made excuses for not conducting the s econd party through their territories, and the only inducement which might have been effective, namely immediate payments on a large scale, was not forthcoming. I confess that I had originally thought that once the Company* s geologists were in touch with the Na'im and the A1 Bu Shamis Shaikhs they would be able to travel without undue difficulty in their territories, but I had anticipated that adequate inducement would be offered to them. 4. I have had no final report yet from the Residency Agent, Sharjah, or from Petroleum Concessions Limited's representatives on the Coast accounting for the failure to/--4- 4 * *^1 * to arrange for a party to pass through Beni Kitab territory and to explore Jebel Faiyah, but the reasons are* I think f not very far to seek. Broadly, they can be put as follows:* (a) Insufficient time for negotiations; (b) Intense suspicion on the part of Shaikh — Mohammad bin Ali; (c) Intensive intrigue by some of the Trucial Coast Shaikhs, in particular, Sharjah, Has al Khaimah and Abu Dhabi. On the first point I need not repeat what I have alfeady said. On the second it is to be remembered that Shaikh Mohammad bin Ali and the Beni Kitab are completely wild and ignorant. They have heard s tories that the object of an ex pedition would be to establish foreign domination in their country and to locate an aerodrome there. Their fears have been played on by those of the Trucial Coast Shaikhs who believe it to be in their interest to prevent exploration in and around Jebel Faiyah; and the suspicions that have been put into their minds have included doubts of the genuine friendship of Shaikh Khalid, the negotiator. The latter's -V — — influence over Shaikh Mohammad bin Ali has proved to be less than we had anticipated, though I still believe that in the course of time he will be able to bring about the desired result. At the moment however intrigue, emanating mainly from Sharjah, has destroyed all sense of proportion in the Beni Kitab, and it will be months before it is possible to overcome the effect which that intrigue, combined with natural antipathy towards t, Christians w , has had on the minds of the Shaikh and his advisers. 5. I shall reserve my recommendations for the future until I have had an opportunity of meeting Mr. Longrigg who is expected in Bahrain early in the New Year. The latter states in a recent letter that his present feeling is that all hopes/*I hopes of inland exploration on the ground this year must be abandoned* I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Political Agent, Bahrain. AConfidential Political Agency, Bahrain, the 21st December 1938• From Captain B. Howes, I.A#, Assistant Political Agent, Bahrain. To H. ^ieightman, Esquire, I.C.S., Political Agent, Bahrain. Report on special duty in connection Subject i-» with the exploration party of Petroleum Concessions Limited in the Dhahira. Sir, I have the honour to submit my report on the above subject. X have divided it under the following heads*- Geographical, Political, Social, Narrative and Conclusion. I regret that it has not been possible to abbreviate it further without loss of completeness. I. GEOGRAPHICAL A sketch map of the Baraimi area is attached (Appendix I), also a sketch map on © smaller scale showing approximate distribution of tribes (Appendix II). The Baraimi oasis consists of groups of date gardens, separated by stretches of unfertile plain. To the south, this plain continues on both sides of Jebel Hafit, at a width of about 3 miles on either side, the eastern plain being bounded by the Oman foothills, and the western plain by continuous sandhills. On the North, the sandhills curve round, and abut on Jebel Sumaini at a place called Ramlat- al-Uneiq ('the little neck of sand'). North of this sand the/-V- the plain runs on past Jebel Faiyah towards Has al I hf imah. Dhaid is situated in the northern part of this plain, on a large wadi which runs from the neighbourhood of Jezirat si Hamra on the Trucial Coast to near the northern end of Jebel Faiyah* The date gardens in the Baraimi oasis are watered by 'felej * 1 (streams) and are very fertile, growing oranges, grapes, mangoes, etcetera, as well as the dates. Most of the other villages shown on sketch 2 are similarly watered by 'felejs 11 . The plain referred to provides abundant grazing for camels. Jebel Hafit rises out of the middle of this plain as an enormous bare hog* s back, to a height of about 3000 feet above the plain level. II. POLITICAL The Baraimi oasis is dominated by Ibrahim bin Uthman, the Wall of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi. The Abu Dhabi villages in the oasis are - Al Ain, Mu’taradh, Jimi, Gatarah, Hili, Iffas^di and Muraijib. The Al Bu Shamis who live at Hamasah are on good terms with Abu Dhabi 7 the Na* im Shaikh of Baraimi and Sa* arah is disliked and despised by Abu Dhabi (as by every one else). The villages of Hamasah and Baraimi like most close neighbours are at constant feud. The Al Bu Shamis are an off shoot of the Na* im tribe; but they separated from them before the tribe migrated to the Dhahirah from ~atar, possibly over 300 years ago. The Abu Dhabi force in the oasis is represented by the Dhuwahir and the Hajadat, both bedouin tribes, but semi- settled. For the other tribes shown in Appendix II, a tabular statement will be the briefest method, in which I include those already mentioned. This is given as Appendix III. It is, of course, impossible to define boundaries between tribes. In fact, there are none. The influence of Ibn Saud is practically nil, though he remains in the back of people* s minds as a possible offset to Muscat, and I have heard his name used for this/-this purpose. The Beni Kitab and Duru* tribee give 'hedu” (presents) to him, but they get gifts in exchange. I also know that Mohammad bin lahmah does so, and pc«»3ibly others. But Mohammad bin Rahmah added that he allowed no interference in his affairs, either from Ibn Saud or the Sultan of Muscat. Muscat influence is also practically nil; and the Wall of Sohar seemed to be more anxious to maintain a large number of guards, and to placate the local Shaikhs than I myself felt to be necessary before his arrival. Muscat penetration is, of course, strongly resented by Abu Dhabi, who are the real masters of the Baraimi oasis. III. SOCIAL (a) The villages are well-to-do and fertile, especially by comparison with the Trucial Coast towns. (b) There are very large amounts of rifles and ammunition in the oasis, chiefly Martinis and Mauser. Sven boys of 15 or so carry rifles, and one hears about ten or a dozen shots every day in the Baraimi - Hamasah gardens. (c) Trade is largely with the Batineh, as being easier of access;: although the Muscat customs tariff is higher than that of Dubai. Rice and piece-goods are imported; and dates exported. (d) The chief slave-market is at Hamasah, where probably a thousand slaves are sold every year.\ The Dhaikh gets Rs.20/- on every sale in his village. (Jealousy of this market is one of the prime causes of the Hamasah - Baraimi hostility). Slaves are mostly imported through Suweiq and Masna* in the Batineh, where the trade is protected by Hilal bin Hamad, Shaikh of the A1 Saad tribe. (e) The country is very backward. Some people thought the cars were animals and drank water from troughs, while the Beni Ka f ab believed that we had some 'medicine” which, if poured on to the hills, would turn them into silver. iven the/-,4- the Shaikhs are ignorant, and one of them, on having an Arabic letter read over to him by his own man, asked to have it translated into Arabic l I believe that no ^uropoan has been to Baraimi since Sir Percy Cox in 1905# At any rate, we had an audience of over 5C to watch us have , re&amp;k-* fast on the first day. IV. NARRATIVE The party left Abu Dhabi on November 21st, having arranged our passage to Baraimi through the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi. On our arrival we camped in the land of Shaikh 3aqr bin Sultan, and tried to get him to provide us with an escort to take us south to meet the other geological party. This proved impossible owing to his weakness and unpopularity; and we were unable to move from Baraimi until ’’rafic^’s came from the V.ali of Sohar on November 26th. These took us to Hafit, where we met the other geological party; but they would not allow us to bring more than two cars. The geologists found a very obstructive spirit among the Shaikhs who had come with the Wali, notably Mohammad bin iahmah and Ahmad as-Saif; and they had to pay Rs. 70/- for doing one morning^ work on Jebel Hafit. The two parties then returned to Baraimi, and the Muscat party left on November 30th for Sohar by way of the Wadi Jizzi. ’Vith some difficulty, an agreement was negotiated with Shaikh Saqr bin Sultan, giving the Company permission to conduct exploratory work in his territory. This was reduced to writing and signed on December 2nd. We then attempted to come to terms with Shaikhs Mohammad bin Rahmah and Ahmad as-Salf; but found them obdurate in their refusal to deal, though both were in sore need of money. They were obviously under strong outside influence, chiefly from Abu Dhabi, but also from other t, anti-Christian M sources, such as Mohammad bin Ali. Shaikh Obeid bin Juma* of the Beni Ka’ab came in on December 3rd, but said that his people were/-- 6 - ($)3&gt; o A were under imperfect controlj and t*hat he frankly could not guarantee our safety if we came into his country in cars. As the geologists were unwilling to resort to camel at this stage* he was asked to return to his country and endeavour to change popular feeling* It was indicated chat money need be no obstacle. On December 6th* hohammad bin Hahmah and Ahmad as-Self asked for permission to return to their country, declaring that they had ’’done their part n . They were, however, induced by the vali of Sohar to stay * nominally for our protection* actually* I think* for his* Later, Ahmad as-3alf showed very distinct eagerness to come to terms with the Company, but repeated that he must consult Mohammad bin Hahmah before doing sot and this effectually closed negotiations. On December 11th* the Beni Ka*ab sent a letter saying that they would allow exploration at the price of Rs. 50*000/-* Mr* Williamson wished to reply* offering Bs. 1000/-$ but the Wall asked him not to do so (having, I think, orders from the Sultan not to allow direct contact between the Company and the Shaikhs). He offered to get into touch with the 3eni Ka* ab himself; but then later consulted Mohammad bin Hahmah and Ahmad as-Saif (a meeting to which he tried to make me a party), and allowed himself to be over-ruled by them. The next day (December 13th) he asked permission to return to Sohar. He had received a letter from the Sultan in the following sense, as reported by my clerk* who saw it:- 'You should not take the party to places which the other party has seen. They may move in the vicinity of Baraimi and Hafit, but not to places visited by the other party* If they have finished their work in Baraiml, they should not be allowed to remain there, and you should return to Sohar* They should not be allowed to explore in their motors.* 1 Later in the day Mr* Williamson received a letter authorising him/-him to withdraw, if he saw no hope of progress. The paruy therefore returned to Abu Dhabi on December 15th# V. CONCLUSION The failure of the expedition cannot be ascribed to any single cause, but the following played their partr?:- (a) Dislike by the Shaikhs of large scale commercial penetration, with consequent increase in the greed and power of their M nobility w . Coupled with this, the reali zation that, in order to guarantee our safety, they must make large distributions to prominent local people from whatever sum they might receive from the Company. (b) 'Anti-Christian” fanaticism. (c) Abu Dhabi*s hostility to (i) The Company, and (ii) Muscat. (d) Mutual jealousies and intrigues; the fear that one*s pet enemy may come to terns with the Company and be enriched. (e) 'Mental defeat^ism'. The incapacity to understand the activities of an oil company, and the feeling that 'no is the easiest and safest answer. I have the honour to be, Sir, Vour most obedient servant, Sd/- J. B. Howes.

Dy^hifRE HESio^NCyI ' /Vo f ?/ * *xx) 1 Date.. coxr.Dziiaiai rzcoYds' Dated the 23rd December 1938 /%«&gt;■ I am writing this to supplement my official letter No. C/793 dated the 23rd December 1938 about P.C.L. Explo ration. 2 . I blame myself that I did not attempt to prevent any change whatsoever in the Company’s original exploration plans At the time it seemed desirable, as with the whole question of the approach from Muscat,, to let them try out their own ideas. 3. From various indications I think it is probable that the Company will try to put much of the blame for failure on the presence of tfcfe- Political Officer. If so, you may be interested to hear the opinion, based on reports from Howes, that the Trucial Coast party might quite well have found themselves unable to move even from Abu Dhabi to Baraimi but for his own presence with them as representative of the Political Agent whom the Shaikh had promised to conduct any where he chose to go in Abu Dhabi territory. Similarly the party’s stay in Baraimi would probably have been very much ■v shorter. v 4. Williamson is leaving for Basra, and I do not think that any further efforts will be made at inland exploration this year, at any rate from the Trucial Coast. Longrigg himself is due in Abu Dhabi# to-day to start negotiations for a concession or for an exploration permit like the one \ with Ras al Khaimah. He writes that he expects to come to Bahrain in the first week of January. 5/- The Honourable Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Trenchard Fowle, K.C.I.E., C.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.- 2 - i 5. I am afraid there is no chance of the Residency Agent getting into personal touch with Shaikh Mohammad bin Ali. The latter is in a dreadful state of nerves at the moment and must b« allowed to quieten down a bit. Khalid will, I believe, 'get him' sooner or later. In cidentally my instructions to the Residency Agent were to work in close collaboration with the P.C.L. people , and with Shaikh Khalid, and to do everything he possibly could - directly or indirectly - to promote an agreement. 6 . One cannot help feeling that a month or two of Aden methods on and behind the Trucial Coast would have most admirable results. | — «*■ ' Yours sincerely,</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00029c_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/1/694</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00029c</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/1/694</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'86/21 - II P.C.L.

One exploration party was sent from Muscat to Jebel Hafit and Baraimi with the assistance of the Sultan of Muscat (Sayyid Sa‘īd bin Taymūr Āl Bū Sa‘īd) and escorted by the Wali of Sohar (Mudhaffar Suliman). The other, escorted by a political officer John Baron Howes, hoped to travel through Beni Kitab [Beni Qitab] territory and visit Jebel Faiyah before going on to Baraimi, but ultimately had to travel there directly from Abu Dhabi with the assistance of the Wali of Al Ain (Ibrāhīm bin ʻUthmān).The remainder of the volume discusses the various intrigues and difficulties encountered by the exploration parties in attempting to negotiate with the principal tribes at the Baraimi Oasis in order to gain access to their territory for exploration. The tribes involved include the Na’im [Na‘īm] (Shaikh Saqr bin Sulṭān), Al Bu Shamis [Āl Bū Shāmis] (Shaikh Muḥammad bin Raḥmāh bin Salmin), Beni Ka’ab [Banū Ka‘ab] and Abu Dhabi.Contained within the volume are detailed letters and reports submitted by John Baron Howes, Assistant Political Agent at Bahrain, who had accompanied one of the exploration parties to Baraimi. The correspondence details the various negotiations to enable the parties to travel, incidents on route and day by day accounts of the exploration party’s work and their interactions with the various tribes there. Folios 131-141 comprise Howe’s official report of his special duty in connection with the PCL exploration party and includes two sketch maps, one of the geographical layout of the Baraimi Oasis and the other of the distribution of the various tribes around the Oasis. A detailed appendix lists every tribe residing at the Oasis and includes details of their leaders, strength of arms, where their main settlement was, and whether they were Ghafiri or Hinawari [Hinawi].Also discussed are the lack of attempts made by the Shaikh of Sharjah to permit the geologists to visit Jebel Faiyah and subsequent attempts by Shaikh Khalid [Shaikh Khalid bin Aḥmad bin Sulṭān Āl Qasimī], Regent of Kalba to negotiate with Shaikh Muhammad bin Ali [Muḥammad bin ‘Īsá], Chief of the Beni Kitab to arrange for the PCL geologists to travel there. The negotiations were unsuccessful owing to the intrigues of various individuals on the Trucial coast, which the British believed to be orchestrated by the Shaikh of Sharjah (Shaikh Sulṭān bin Saqr Āl Qasimī).Other matters discussed in the volume include:PCL’s wish to establish an aerodrome at Baraimi, and their subsequent decision to establish it nearer to the coast owing to the difficulties encountered at Baraimi and the likely cost of acquiring permission from the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi (Shaikh Shakhbūt bin Sulṭān bin Zāyid Āl Nahyān);memorandum and reports from the Residency Agent at Sharjah (‘Abd al Razzaq) on visits made by Shaikh Saqr bin Sultan, Ruler of Baraimi and Shaikh Mohammed bin Rahmah, Chief of the Al Bu Shamis to the Trucial coast and of the various intrigues occurring on the Trucial coast in relation to the work of the geological exploration parties at Baraimi;the intention of the PCL geologists on their return to Muscat to travel to Ras-al-Hadd [Ra’s al Ḩadd] and undertake an aerial survey of the coastal area south of Ras-al-Hadd.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Chief of the Al Bu Shamis</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Petroleum Concessions Limited</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Native Agent, Trucial Coast, Sharjah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Abu Dhabi, Āl Nahyān dynasty</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Wāli of Sohar</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Assistant Political Agent, Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent and Consul, Muscat</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Regent of Kalba</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Ruler of Baraimi</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Wāli of Al Ain</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Banū Ka'ab (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Āl Bū Shāmis (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Āl Na'īm (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Baraimi</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Jebel Hafit</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Muscat</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Jebel Faiyah</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Geological surveying</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00029c#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
