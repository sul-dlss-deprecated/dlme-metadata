Parts of the city due north of the Masjid al-Haram are visible in the middleground.A large two-storey, fortified building is situated immediately below the horizon on the foothills of the northern ridge, to the far left of the image: this is the same building noted in X463/4.A sloping bank of scree make up the lower right foreground and middleground, while in the distant background a chain of hills is visible.This is the fourth of four photographs taken from the same vantage point, which form a panoramic view over the city of Mecca. The first, second and third are X463/2, X463/3 and X463/4 respectively.The negative has had hand-work applied, creating a drawing-like quality in places.InscriptionsAbove image, on the right, in ink: ‘V’Lower centre and upper centre: illegible, partially erased Arabic script</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Landscape photography</topic></subject><subject><topic>Historic buildings</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023514790.0x000008#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
