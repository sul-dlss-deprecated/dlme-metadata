An Account of the AfFghan Monarchs who assumed the Title of Kings of Persia, with a cursory View of the Invasion of that Country by the Turks and Russians. The reign of the AfFghan monarchs, Mahmood and Ashr^ff, over chap. xvi. Persia, occupies a short, but eventful period in the history of that country. The first of those sovereigns, though cruel and capricious, A - h. 1134. Measures showed, in the commencement of his reign, some of the qualities of adopted by mi ii -r Mahmood, on a good statesman. Ihe moment he became master of Isfahan, he his endeavoured to relieve its inhabitants from the miseries of famine, tyofPersla'' His next care was to establish confidence among his new subjects: and in both of these important objects he succeeded. It appeared to this prince as dangerous to employ the officers of the Persian government, as to appoint his own to stations, with the duties of which they were wholly unacquainted*: he ordered, therefore, the # Hanway, Vol. II. page 183. VOL. 11. B2 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xvi. Persians he found in office to be continued, but nominated a colleague to each from his own nation: and, by this arrangement, he had the advantage of the experience of the one, and the fidelity of the other*. The only exception to this rule, was the chief judge of the city, and to that high situation he appointed an Affghan of such singular piety and rectitude, that the citizens themselves assented to the propriety and justice of his choice. It is natural that conquerors and usurpers, whatever benefit they may have derived from treason, should hate and dread those whom they know to be traitors. Every person who had carried on a secret correspondence with the AfFghans, or had been false to their duty during the siege, was punished by Mahmoodf: and the Persians saw, with delight, the Affghan prince avenge the wrongs of their late sovereign. The Waly of Arabia escaped with life, (on account, it was believed, of a vow which the conqueror had made not to kill him); but he was disgraced, and his possessions in the province of Khuzistan given to his younger brother. The noblemen of the Persian court, who had preserved their fidelity unshaken to Shah Hussein, were those who appeared to be most favoured by the Affghan monarch: and he carried this so far, as publicly to approve the integrity and spirit of Mahomed Kooli Khan, the prime minister, who would not take an oath of allegiance until assured he should never be called upon to act against the prince, T^masp MeerzaJ. The same considerations which made Mahmood endeavour to conciliate the good opinion of his new subjects, induced him to grant every encouragement to the foreigners in Persia. Several European * Krusinski's Memoir, page 259. f Kminski's Memoir, page 258. t Hanway, Vol. II. page 184.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 3 nations had, at this period, factories at Isfahan and Bander Abbas: chap. xvi. these were confirmed in all their privileges, and the Christian missionaries were allowed full liberty to perform publicly the duties of their religion. But this fair prospect was soon clouded: and the occurrence of events, which excited apprehensions for his own safety in the mind of this monarch, banished, in an instant, all his plans of good government, and rendered him one of the most detestable and cruel tyrants that the page of history has recorded. It will be necessary to take a short view of the events which appear to have effected the change in the measures of Mahmood. He had, soon after he took possession of the capital, and the districts in its immediate vicinity, detached Aman-fiMh Khan to reduce Kaz- a. d. 1722. a. h.1135. veen. The force sent with this chief, which amounted to six thou sand men*, marched in the depth of winter, when the few troops which the Prince Tdmdsp had been able to collect were dispersed in quarters. It consequently met with no resistance; Kashan, Koom, and all the other cities in its route, surrendered, and Kazveen followed their example. The joy which the news of this easy con quest gave to Mahmood, was checked by intelligence which reached him at the same moment, that an officerhe had sent with a convoy of treasure to Candahar for the purpose of raising new levies among the Affghan tribes, had been attacked, defeated, and plun dered, by the governor J of a petty fortress in Seistan : and he was An embassy also embarrassed at this period by an embassy from Peter the Great the Great. # MSS. of Shaikh Mahomed Aly H&amp;zeen. t Moollah Moosah was the name of this officer.

The Russian . The fact was, the Czar had resolved to take advantage of the con- govemment resolves to in- fusions in Persia to extend the commerce of his kingdom, by making dom of Persia. himself master of the western shores of the Caspian. He had, for this purpose, collected an army of thirty thousand of his best soldiers, which was joined by some Cossacks and Calmooks at Astracan. The injuries which his subjects had sustained from the Lesghees at Sh^m^kee, and from the Khan of Khaurizm, who had plundered a caravan of Russians coming from China, were the pretexts for those preparations. He went through the form of calling upon the ruler of Persia to redress the wrongs of which he complained: and, when told by Mahmood that he had no The czar ad- power to control either the Usbegs or the Lesghees Peter, who vances with a t i -i • • -i i tt large army, commanded his army in person, sailed from the Volga on the A D 1722 • • a.h. 1135! twenty-ninth of July, and arrived on the coast of Ddghestanf on the * Hanway, Vol. II. page 186, 7. t We meet with a full account of the expedition of Peter in the Travels of Mr. P. H. Bruce, who accompanied it. The motives which occasioned the Emperor of Russia to undertake this enterprise, are stated by this writer to have been the desire of avenging the insults and wrongs which his subjects, settled on the shores of the Caspian, had suffered, particularly in the plunder of Shamakee; and a desire to succour the King of Persia against the Affghans, who offered important cessions in return for the aid of the Russian monarch. Part of the expedition embarked at Moscow, and falling down the river which flows through that city, entered the larger stream of the Occa, at the Town of Columnia; and a month after they embarked, they arrived at the City of Muni Novogorod, which stands at the conflux of the Occa and the Volga, whereTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 5 fourth of August. His first step was to issue a proclamation, in chap, xvi. which he declared that he had no ambitious design of enlarging his territories, but only meant to protect his subjects in their fair commerce. He proceeded along the coast, defeated some chiefs by whom he was opposed, and took possession of Derbund^. He confirmed the governor of that town in his charge, but left two thousand Russian troops to garrison the citadel. After this con quest, the czar returned to Astracan, which he reached in October, having signified his intention to prosecute his plans in the commence ment of the ensuing fair season. While the Russians threatened the north-western provinces of a Turkish -r» • i • i •n army enters Persia, that empire was exposed to a still more formidable attack Persia, in another quarter. The Court of Constantinople, as soon as it heard of the situation into which Persia was thrown by the Affghan invasion, hastened to take advantage of its fallen condition. A the whole of the army destined for Persia was assembled. From thence they proceeded down the Volga to the Caspian, and, after a short and prosperous voyage, thirty-three thousand infantry were landed in the province of D&amp;ghestan, where they were soon joined by a considerable body of cavalry that had marched by land from Astracan. # The following account is given of this place by Mr. Bruce: ' The City of Derbent, in the province of Shirwan, lies in 41° 51' north latitude, ' and is situated on the shore of the Caspian: the walls are carried into ten leet depth ' of water, to prevent any one's passing that way: its length, from east to west, is nearly ' five wersts; but its breadth is not proportionable. It is not only the frontier of ' Persia, lying on its utmost confines on this side, but may, with great propriety, ' be called the gate of it, reaching from the mountain into the sea. The city is ' divided into three distinct quarters: the castle, situated upon the top of the moun- ' tain, had always a strong Persian garrison. The second, and principal, reaches from ' the foot of the mountain to the lower town, which makes the third, and reaches to ' the sea side.'—P. H. B ruce's Travels, page 283.6 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xvi. large army was assembled on the frontier, which was already on its march to Hamadan, when all sense of alarm at foreign enemies was banished from the mind of Mahmood, by an occurrence which more immediately threatened the destruction of his power. The inhabitants of Kazveen are chiefly descended from those Turkish tribes which have long pastured their flocks on the plains in the vicinity of that city. They almost all either cultivate the soil, or employ themselves in carrying on commerce with the shores of the Caspian. These habits of life render them hardy and robust; and they are remarkable for having preserved the rude and ungo vernable spirit of their ancestors. Among its other privileges, Kaz veen has always boasted one of a very extraordinary nature. It may be termed a right of insurrection*, which they resort to in cases of violence and oppression. The lower orders act, on these occasions, under the direction of their magistrates, who seldom pro ceed to this extremity except when they have no hope of relief from any other proceeding. They could expect no redress, by any appli cation to Mahmood, from the cruelty and injustice of those he had appointed to rule them; and, independent of the oppression they suffered, their religion and prejudices led them to regard the AfFghans ofSz' With peculiar horror t- In consequence of these feelings, the magis- veen revolt, trates of Kazveen met secretly; and on the evening of the eighth tuMll of January, the signal for a Lootee Bkzkr, or ' general insurrection/' was given. The AfFghans were at once attacked in every quarter. * They term this Lootee B^r, which literally signifies « plundering the bazars, « or shops;' but it implies no more than a general rising of the inhabitants. This ancient usage is still preserved, and will be noticed hereafter, f MSS. of Shaikh Mahomed Aly HSzeen.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. ^ Am &amp;n -tiMh hastened to the Myd^n, or « great squared in front chap. xvi. of the palace, where he found most of his troops assembled; and, though wounded at an early period, he made every effort that a brave soldier could to subdue this tumult: but he was over- And over powered by numbers, and compelled to take shelter in the palace; from whence he with difficulty effected his escape by a private road that led to one of the principal gates. The loss of the Affghans on this occasion was about two thousand men, besides all their property. They were forced instantly to retreat to Isfahan; and they suffered so severely on the march from the inclemency of the season, that not more than half of this corps reached that capital. Ashrdff, who had accompanied Amdn-AMh on this expedi- Ashr&amp;ff pro- ie tion, separated from him on the retreat, and proceeded to Can- dlht. t0 Can &gt; dahar with three hundred men. He appears to have anticipated di the downfall of Mahmood: for the example of Kazveen had been I followed by Khonsar*, and several other towns; and the dispirited l{ | Affghans retired to Isfahan from every quarter, where their prince .y received them with a sullen gloom, that foreboded the dreadful QS means he contemplated to avert those dangers by which he saw himself surrounded. The Affghan prince was certainly, at this moment, in a critical Mahmood is situation. His army was reduced to about fifteen thousand men. sLatbrT^ With this small force he had to maintain himself in a great king- * This beautiful town, which lies about ninety-two miles to the north-east of Isfahan, is still in a very flourishing state.

When the reputation of his arms was at the highest, these alarming considerations had operated with great force upon his mind, and had rendered him wavering and undecided even in the moment of victory: now that he saw his bravest troops dis heartened, and his enemies elated with triumph, he appears to have become distracted with apprehension. The male population of Isfahan and its suburbs alone, was still in a proportion of more than twenty to one to the Affghans. The probable revolt of the capital seemed the most immediate danger, and Mahmood resolved to re move it by measures which could only have occurred to a mind that was as cowardly as it was cruel and savage.

About children. three hundred came; and the moment they arrived, the signal was given for their massacre-f : not one escaped : and the tyrant was so relentless, that he even refused mercy to a youth of twelve years of age, the son of the Waly of Georgia, who had fled for protection to one of the principal Affghan chiefs, by whom he had been adopted. The bodies of all these nobles were exposed on the grand square before the palace, that the inhabitants might see and tremble. But a * The prime minister, Mahomed Kooli Khan, was spared, because his brother had assisted the Affghans at Kazveen; and Lootf Aly Khan was not put to death on this occasion. t This dreadful massacre took place on the twenty-fifth of January, 1723.— K rusinski's Memoir, page 263.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 9 more horrid tragedy was yet to be acted. It is the characteristic of chap . xvr. guilt to seek safety in greater crime. It was thought, that sons might hereafter desire to revenge the blood of their fathers; and the day after this massacre, the male children of the nobles that had been slain, amounting to upwards of two hundred, were led from their schools, to a field in the vicinity of the city, where they were all inhumanly slaughtered. Mahmood pretended that the nobles had conspired against his life; but his real design of reducing the number of his enemies by extirpation was soon developed*. He had taken three thousand of the guards of Shah Hussein into pay : he directed ' that these men should be peculiarly well treated ; and, as a mark of favour, he commanded that a dinner should be dressed for them in one of the squares of the palace. The moment they were seated a Massacre of party of AfFghans fell upon them, and not one was spared+• But JlTdVfThe this bloody act proved only the commencement of the horrid 8uards ' scene.

The inhabitants of Isfahan were chiefly tradesmen and manufac turers, and that city had long been the residence of a luxurious and # Krusinski's Memoir, page 264. J Hanway, Vol, II. page 190. VOL.

Its men have always been accounted the most un- warlike in Persia ; but it must have been that accumulation of miseries which thej endured, that reduced them to the wretched and degraded state of mind in which they appeared during these scenes ot blood and horror. It was common, we are told, to see an Affghan leading three and four Persians to execution : and though death was certain, such was the cowardly despondency of the whole population, that not one example occurred of the victims even struggling with their fate*. Mahmood, at this period, threw off the mask of mode ration and justice he had before put on. All ranks were pillaged: nor did the factories of foreign nations escape ; both the English and Dutch suffered, but particularly the latter, who had amassed a large sum by selling sugar during the distresses of the siege, at an exorbi tant ratef*. Mahmood forced them to reveal where their treasures were concealed, and took from them to an amount of four hundred thousand crowns. The Indians settled at Isfahan were also plun dered ; and the Armenians were not only forced to pay another con tribution, but several of their chief magistrates were put to death. Relieved, by the adoption of these dreadful measures, from his fears regarding the inhabitants of Isfahan, Mahmood proceeded to reduce the country in its neighbourhood. The brave inhabitants of fSuiltr Ben ' Isfahan sti11 resisted ^ arms; and that village, after a gallant defence, made an honourable capitulation, which was guaranteed by the principal Affghan chiefs. Mahmood, who feared openly to violate such a compact, employed secret agents to betray them into a sedition, that might justify him in satiating his vengeance upon those who had murdered his relations. But the honest peasants, who Hanway, Vol. II. page 190. t Hanway, Vol. II. page 192.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 11 were as sincere in their allegiance after they had surrendered, as they chap. xvi. had been before in their hostility, seized his agents, and sent them bound into Isfahan. The prince was so pleased with this act, that he forgave all they had done: and some months afterwards they repaid the confidence that was placed in them, by seizing Lootf Aly Khan; who, when he fled from court, took shelter in their a.d . 1723. A. H. 1136. village. An effort was made by Mahmood to repeople Isfahan; and An attempt to repeople Isfa- some Kurdish tribes were invited to occupy the vacant houses of han. that wretched capital. As they were Soonees, it was expected that a similarity of religion would render them more attached to the AfFghan government than the other inhabitants of Persia*. Many of these Kurds were also taken into the army, which required recruits, as but few soldiers had come from Candahar; from whence, however, all the families of the AfFghans in Persia had been brought by the policy of Mahmood; who found, before he adopted this measure, that desertions were so frequent, as to threaten a serious diminution of his small numbers. Aided by his new levies, Mah- Mahmood takes some mood succeeded in making himself master of some of the principal cities in Irak, cities in Irak-f; in almost all of which a part of the inhabitants were massacred, from the same considerations that had led to the horrid scenes at Isfahan.

His death, which happened a few days afterwards, was much regret- not more regretted by t h e Parsees, or Guebers, than it was by the Affghans, Persians, and Armenians. His own degraded race had found themselves exalted by the character of their chief*. The Affghans admired his valour and experience as a soldier; and both the Persians and Armenians lost, by his fall, a generous and humane The rites per- protector. The rites performed at his funeral display the barbarous formed at his i i ■ i i funeral, character of those he commanded. His army marched with solemn silence round his body. They then made his slaves and prisoners do the same, and put them all to death at his feet-f. They also slew the finest of his horses, whose flesh was dressed, and divided among the soldiers, as a funeral feast. Mahmood mourned his brave general with a sincere grief. He erected a monument to his memory; and although Nasser-^iMh was a Parsee, and two priests of that religion were employed to keep alive a sacred fire where his body was placed, the Mahomedan Affghans reverenced his remains as those of a saint J. The command The command of the troops in Fars was given to Zubberdust is given to Zubberdust Khan, a soldier of fortune, who had risen, by his courage and conduct, to the highest rank in the Affghan army.

The Governor of Shiraz, seeing no further prospect of relief, desired to capitulate: but, unfortunately, as the terms were adjusting, the principal posts were abandoned. This the Affghans perceived, and suddenly breaking up Assaults and the conference, made a general assault; and before the Persians ofs^iraz 6 . 0 ^ could recover from their surprise, the city was taken*, and great a,h. 1137. numbers were slain: but the sword did not destroy so many as had before perished from famine; and the Affghans revenged the inhabit ants upon some of those, whose avarice had increased their misery. We are told of the fate of one person, in whose house an immense quantity of grain was found. A stake was fixed in the centre of his granary, to which he was bound, and left to perish from hunger, amidst that abundance which he had refused to share with his fellow citizens -f*. Zubberdust Khan detached a corps to reduce Bunder-Abbas, Detaches a which had been attacked the year before, by a body of five thousand duce S Bunder- men, from the neighbouring province of Baloochistan, who had Abbas ' expected to meet with great wealth at this celebrated seaport.

The Persian inhabitants fled at its approach; but the Europeans showed so resolute a countenance, # Shiraz was taken on the thirteenth of April, 1724, after a blockade of eight months.— Kiiusinski's Memoir, page 276. + Krusinski's Memoir, page 277.14 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xvi. that the chief by whom this corps was commanded feared to attack them*. The expedition ended in his accepting a small supply of provisions; and he returned with a force greatly reduced in num bers by the unhealthiness of the climate. a. d. 1724. Mahmood, encouraged by the reduction of Shiraz, had collected Mahmood an army of thirty thousand men, with which he marched against TgaStKoh- Kohgeeloo, a country situated about three degrees to the southward of Isfahan: but he was so harassed by the tribes of Arabs who inhabit some of the neighbouring districts, and his troops suffered so much from the great difference of climate which they experienced when they descended into the plains near the sea coast, that he was isunsuccess- compelled to retreat without effecting his object. We may judge how sensible he was of the disgrace he had incurred by the failure of this ill-judged expedition, when informed, that he entered his capital at night, and in a private manner. It has been before stated, that the Affghan prince had recruited his army by enrolling a number of Kurds in his ranks, but he con tinued to look with anxiety for reinforcements from Candahar. This long expected party at length arrived+, but their numbers were few. A report had been spread among the inhabitants of his native pro vince that he had become avaricious, that he neglected his bravest soldiers, and that he had not only adopted the manners of the Persians, but was secretly inclined to the heresy of that nation. These sentiments had become very general in his army; and they * Krusinski's Memoir, page 277. t The mother of Mahmood arrived with this caravan: and the Persians, accustomed to royal state, were astonished to see the mother of their sovereign riding astride on a camel through the streets of Isfahan.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 13 were increased into mutinous clamour by the failure of an attack chap, xvl that he made upon the City of Yezd; from which he was repulsed with great loss. To add to his embarrassment, the two principal Affghan chiefs, AshrM' and Aman-tillah, were known to be discon tented.

The latter-f* had also cessor!' 18 SUC * When Mahmood first ascended the throne of the degraded Hussein, he was thrown into consternation by the desertion of his cousin Ashr&amp;iF. This youth was the son of Meer AbdullS., whom Mahmood had slain, and had always been an object of jealousy to that ruler; but his life was defended by the attachment of the Affghans, and the new monarch of Persia feared to provoke the resentment of his own tribe. He thought, at one period, that he had found an opportunity of accomplishing the object of ruining Ashraif without risk to himself. The post which that youth defended was forced by Tam^isp Meerza, when that prince effected his escape from Isfahan. On this occurrence he assembled all the Affghan chiefs, and endeavoured to rouse their in dignation against a commander, whom he represented as having, by his cowardice and bad conduct, exposed them to all the fatigues and dangers of a long and protracted siege. Ashr£iff repelled the charge with that freedom which the usages of his nation permitted, and showed that his post had been so weakened, that it was impossible he could resist the superior numbers by whom he was attacked. It was established, by undeniable evidence, that he had done all that valour could to prevent the prince's escape, and that those only were to blame who had deprived him of the means of suc cess, by detaching the men under his command to other quarters. He was acquitted by the unanimous voice of the assembled chiefs ; and Mahmood had the mortification to find his ill-judged attack had increased the reputation and popularity of him whom he desired to ruin. — K rusinski's Memoir. f Am^n-ull&amp;-h's professed cause of discontent was personal disappointment. It is generally believed that Mahmood had promised to share all his conquests with this ambitious and able chief, to whose valour and judgment he had been greatly indebted for his success.16 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xvi. left him to return to his native country; and though a reconciliation had taken place, it was not sincere. So situated, he could repose no confidence in his army, and it became every day more evident that he had as much to dread from his own tribe, as from his enemies. Mahmoodhas The mind of Mahmood proved unequal to the great difficulties recourse to Tap&amp;ssji. with which he was at this period assailed; and after his return from a. d.1725. a. h. iisf.' the unsuccessful expedition to Yezd, he had recourse to an expedient for the recovery of his affairs, which displayed the weakest supersti tion, if it was not, as many believed it to be, the effect of mental its usage derangement*. The usage ofT^pdssd, or abstraction of the soul from described. the contemplation of all sublunary objects till it becomes absorbed in the Divinity, has spread from India over all the nations of Asia: and the Persian Sooffee, the Mahomedan Faquir, and Hindoo Joghee, or Sunn^see, vie with each other in efforts to subdue nature by rigid austerities. It is the habit of these ascetics to remain for days almost without food -f, with their minds fixed upon one object, pronouncing the mysterious name of God, till they become inspired, or rather, till they mistake the wanderings of imagination, which are the conse quence of their corporeal sufferings, for heavenly inspirations. This superstition is common with the Affghans; and their distracted sovereign had now recourse to it, in the hope that he might ob tain divine aid, to extricate him from the dangers with which he saw himself surrounded. He chose a dark subterraneous vault for this extraordinary penance; and, during fourteen or fifteen days that he remained there, he took hardly any sustenance. When he # Krusinski's Memoir, page 290. t A small portion of dry bread and water is sometimes allowed to the person performing T^passf*.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 17 came again into the light his countenance was shrunk and pale, chap. xvi. his body emaciated, and the wild stare of his eyes gave reason to conclude, that his mind, if before sane, had not been able to moodaft erthe ' ' Tapass^. stand the severe trial to which it had been exposed. He appears to have been reduced to the lowest state of nervous weakness, and became so restless and suspicious, that he started at the approach of his best friends, evidently thinking every man who came near him meant to take his life While in this miserable and wretched state, intelligence was brought to him, that Suffee Meerza, the eldest son of Shah Hussein, had escaped from Isfahan: and, before this report was discovered to be false, he had issued a fatal mandate for the destruc- Massacre of tion of all the males of the royal family of Persia, except Shah of the royal Hussein.

Their numbers are said, by European writers, to have been much greater: and one J of these relates, that among them were two of the youngest sons of Hussein, who fled to their father for protection. He sheltered them in his arms; but Mahmood advanced, with fury demanded their blood, and struck at one of them with his dagger. The arm of Hussein received the wound; and the Affghan prince, savage as he was, could not but shrink with horror at seeing the blood of a monarch whom he had been accustomed to behold and treat with reverence. This occurrence, it is said |1, checked his rage, and he spared the children. * Krusinski's Memoir, page 290. J Krusinski's Memoir, page 291. VOL. II.

His reason was completely unsettled, and he comes insane, ^came outrageously mad^'. The Affghan and Persian physicians tried in vain to restore him: resort was even had to the Armenian clergy 'f', and their prayers were offered upon the head of the royal maniac; but the malady increased: and as the Affghans were threat ened by an attack of the Persian prince, T^masp, they elected Death of Ashraff J to be their ruler, before Mahmood expired. It is asserted, Mahmood. . i . j i r that the miserable existence of that prmce was shortened by a few hours ||, that his successor might enjoy the satisfaction of having slain the murderer of his father: but other and more probable accounts say, that Mahmood died in a state of the most dreadful insanity : and we are informed by one author §, that his mother, * Shaikh Mahomed Aly H^zeen states, that he went mad, and not only tore off his own flesh, bat ate it. f There can be no ground whatever to doubt this fact. Hanway mentions it, as well as the respectable author whom I have generally followed in this part of the history, who details the particulars of this extraordinary ceremony.— K kusinski's Memoir, page 150.

A great conquest had, perhaps, never been effected with less His character means than those possessed by Mahmood : and this fact might ment.^ 6 ™ lead to a conclusion, that all deficiencies were supplied by the energy and greatness of his mind: but this prince, who had early repaired the disadvantages of a bad frame of body by exercise and temperance, had no more than the common qualities of a chief of a savage tribe. He possessed personal courage, and was active and vigilant. He is said to have taken pride in being a strict observer of his word when that was pledged: but he appears to have combined in his character the most consummate deceit with the most ferocious barbarity. The empire of the Suffavean kings, when he attacked it, was like a vast fabric tottering to its fall. It was over thrown by the deplorable weakness of its sovereign; the baseness of a superstitious and corrupt court; the effeminacy and treachery of disaffected nobles; and the cowardice of an unwarlike and dis contented people. We find the chief, at whose slight touch this immense structure fell to the ground, trembling at his own success, and alarmed at the magnitude of the ruins by which he saw him self surrounded : and though we discover, when he first ascended the throne of Persia, a gleam of that greatness which almost justifies conquest, as it brings happiness to those it has subdued; his conduct, on this occasion, appears to have been only an artful expedient to lull into security his intended victims; or, at the best, a weak effort of virtue, in which he had not the fortitude to persevere. The means which he latterly adopted to secure himself on the throne he had seized, are perhaps the most horrid recorded in history, and have20 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xvi. justly consigned his memory to universal execration. Dreadful as are the ravages and massacres of all conquerors, they are often, in a slight degree, palliated by generous and great actions: and we view with astonishment, if not with admiration, the red track of a Chenghiz Khan, or a Timour: but we must turn, with an unmixed feeling of horror and disgust, from a series of bloody massacres committed to quiet the fears of a savage ruler, who knew no way of preserving himself in that power which he had obtained by violence, except by the destruction of those who had submitted to his authority. But if the deep crimes of the Persian court were punished by the visitation of such an enemy, the dreadful close of Mahmood's life exhibits a scene as terrible as retributive justice could exact. He died under the most excruciating tortures of mind and body, in the prime of his youth, and the commencement of his reign: for he had hardly attained his twenty-seventh year, and had only enjoyed the throne of Persia for the short period of three years. a shroff sue- Mahmood was succeeded by his cousin, Ashr^ff, the son of mood.

The Persian prince had endeavoured, at different periods, to negotiate with both the Turkish and Russian courts. His ambassador to Constantinople had been stopped at Kars-f: but Ismail Beg, the envoy whom he sent to Petersburgh, had reached that capital, and was with the Czar when Baku surren dered. This minister succeeded in concluding a treaty, by which Concludes a treaty with it was stipulated J, that the Emperor of Russia should expel the Russia.

There were some subordinate articles of this treaty relative to the supply of the Russian army while acting in Persia, and the future extension of the commerce between the two nations.

The mother of the deceased monarch was com pelled to remain one night in the square with the bodies of the Persian princes who had been massacred by her cruel son. These were afterwards put in coffins, and sent, with funeral pomp, to the City of Koom, where they were interred. The artful Affghan, while he publicly deprecated the crimes of his predecessor, pretended that he could never assume a crown obtained by such guilt: he laid it at the feet of the unfortunate Hussein, and entreated him to resume his right. The captive monarch refused, declaring he was more happy in retirement than ever he had been upon the throne; and the farce ended in his appearing to compel the Affghan chief to place the diadem upon his own head*. Ashraff, before he succeeded to power, invited Tam^sp to come invites xa- to Isfahan. That weak and unfortunate prince, after several vain faimn. 0 IS efforts to establish his authority in Aderbijan and Irak, had retired to Mazenderan, where he was supported by Futteh Aly Khanf. Pleased with the prospect of a division among his enemies, he advanced towards the capital: but the death of Mahmood made a most serious alteration in the views of Ashr^ff, who, however, still pretended friendship, in the hope of being able to seize the person of the legitimate prince of the country. His art was so well employed # Krusinski's Memoir, Part II. page 163. f The Turkish tribe, of which Futteh Aly Khan was chief, had been long settled in Persia; and a considerable branch of them were planted at Asterabad, to defend that quarter against the inroads of the Turkomans.28 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xvi. to effect this object, that he must have succeeded, if some secret friends had not conveyed intelligence to T^mdsp of his design.

When he learnt that a numerous Turkish army was on its march towards his capital, he laid waste the country on the route upon which they were moving, and advanced, with a. d . me. all the force he could assemble, to endeavour to impede their A H l188, progress.

His private emissaries were at this period most actively employed in disseminating these opinions, and in cor rupting the integrity of the Kurdish chiefs who had joined the Ottomans; and, to give more effect to these intrigues, he sent a dissensions among his enemies. of # This citadel remains, and is, to this day, called the Fort of Ashraff. t This action took place about sixty miles from Isfahan. $ Hawkins's Ottoman Empire, Vol. IV. page 290.30 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xvi. deputation of four priests, who were alike venerable for their age and character, to the Pachd's camp.

If you continue, by such injustice, to compel ' your brethren to defend themselves, on your head be all the blood 44 that is shed/' Ahmed Pdchd, who saw that this speech (which was delivered in the most solemn tone,) had made a great im pression, immediately answered : ' I came here by command of my ' sovereign, who is not only a temporal monarch, but the true ' successor of the caliphs; and consequently the spiritual head of all ' orthodox Mahomedans.

Ahmed P4ch4 saw that he had no remedy to prevent that discontent which had been excited among his troops becoming general, except by hastening an action. This he was further encouraged to by his An action, in which the great superiority of numbers : his army consisted of sixty thousand Turks are men, and he had seventy pieces of cannon. The Affghans had not more than half this force; and their artillery was forty swivels, mounted on camels. The Turks were, however, defeated, with the loss of twelve thousand men; and the route would have been com plete, had not the policy of Ashraff recalled his men from the pursuit of an enemy with whom he desired peace, not war; and who could, he knew, if provoked to a great exertion, overwhelm him with their armies-f*. The Turkish general was obliged, after this defeat, to retire towards Kermanshah, leaving a part of his artillery, and almost all his baggage, to the Affghans.

Ashrdff not only performed what he promised, but released all the prisoners he had made during the war : and by this wise moderation he became so popular throughout the Turkish with whom he dominions, that the Court of Constantinople was compelled to con- concludes a peace. elude a peace, by which it was stipulated, that Ashrdff should acknowledge the grand signior as the spiritual head of the Maho- medans*: in return for which, he was recognised as sovereign of Persia. The provinces which the Turkish government possessed were granted in perpetuity f. This included the whole of Kurdistan and Khuzistan, a part of Aderbijan, and several cities in Irak J. There were in this treaty other articles which related to the restora tion of cannon and military stores taken during the war, and the right of AshrM' to send annually a caravan with pilgrims to Mecca. The Affghan prince could not, in the situation of his affairs, have expected to make a better treaty than he did. Throughout the whole of his contest with the Turks he had displayed the most consummate ability; and we are at a loss which to admire most, his valour and military skill, or that moderation and wisdom, by which he obliged a haughty and powerful court to acknowledge his title to the throne of the Suffavean monarchs. The settlement of the war with the Turks gave AshrM* leisure to prepare against more serious dangers. That prince had made an ineffectual attempt to obtain possession of Candahar, which was held by the brother of the deceased Mahmood. This failure had created a division among the Ghiljee Affghans, which seemed likely to * Han way, Vol. II. page 253 . + Hanway) VoI&lt; „ ^ ^ J Among these were Sultaneah and Teheran, the present capital of Persia.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 33 prevent those in Persia from being in future reinforced, even by their chap. xvi. own tribe.

The accession of strength which the junction of Nddir gave Tamdsp, enabled that prince to act upon the offensive. Nddir brought five thousand men, and Futteh Aly Khan Kujur had three thousand. The high reputation of the chiefs by whom this force was commanded soon increased its numbers. Recruits flocked from all quarters to the only standard that promised relief to Persia from the intolerable oppression of a foreign yoke. The first enterprise of the royal army was against Mushed, then under the rule of the chief of the Affghan tribe of Abddllee. When on the march to Khorassan, Nddir Kooli, impatient of a rival, put to VOL.

T&amp;m&amp;sp, who seems to have approved of this puts Futteh actj immediately invested N^dir with the sole command. Both Aly Khan to death. Mushed and Herat were reduced: and, in this season, the whole Mushed and r- rri Herat re- ot Khorassan was compelled to recognise Tdm^sp as the legitimate duced, • sovereign of Persia*. Honours were heaped upon the man who had effected this great revolution in the fortunes of his prince: and Nddir, who had been before made captain of the guards, now received the name of Tani4sp Kodli Khan, which signifies ' the ' slave of Tcimdspan appellation that gratified the vanity of the monarch, as it implied the devoted submission of a powerful chief, while it served the purpose of the favourite, by promoting his object, which was to disclaim the appearance of power, that he might more securely attain the substance. AshrdfF, who had succeeded in taking Yezd, and whose ambas sador had just been received at Constantinople with the highest honours, had hardly begun to enjoy his good fortune, when he was awakened by the reports of the great successes that had attended the arms of Shah T^rn^sp in Khorassan. Though the name of that monaich had long excited the contempt of his enemies, this great change in his fortune could not be regarded with indifference; and the preparations of the Affghan prince showed that he had a just sembies aii SenSe of the nature of that dan g&lt;* by which he was threatened.

Small garrisons were left in the principal cities of the * Hanway, Vol. II. page £68.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 35 empire, and a number of the male inhabitants of these were ordered chap. xvi. to retire upon pain of death. This want of confidence not only weakened the power of Ashr^ff by spreading the impression of his fears, but strengthened the ranks of his enemy with men full of resentment, who were ardent to return as conquerors to those habitations from which they had been banished by the timid policy of an alarmed tyrant. The experience of Nddir prevented the prince he served from marching to Isfahan. He expected that AshrM* would advance into Khorassan, and was aware of all the advantages of carrying on the war in that province. Nor was he mistaken. The Affghan prince hastened to attack a foe who he knew was adding daily a. d. 1729. a. h. 1141. to his numbers. The armies met near the Town of D^mgMn : and the AfFghans, who were accustomed to put the Persians to flight by their savage yells, could not be restrained from an in stant attack : but the troops of N^dir received the shock in so firm Attacks the Persians. a manner, that they were compelled to fall back. AshrM* imme diately directed two divisions of his army to make a circuit to the right and left, and attack the Persians in the flank and rear; while he made another charge with the main body on their front. But the experienced eye of NMir Kooli saw and defeated all these attacks: and when the AfFghans were driven back in every direction, The Affghans he ordered a general charge, which was completely successful. This victory* was obtained with a very trifling loss on the part of the Persians; but the Affghans suffered severely, and the whole * This battle was fought on the second of October, 1729.—H anway , Vol. II. page 274.36 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xvi. of their camp and baggage fell into the hands of their enemies. Their flight must have been extremely precipitate, as a great proportion of their army arrived at Teheran on the second day after the action, a distance of nearly two hundred miles from the field of battle. From that city they proceeded, by hasty marches, to Isfahan; and AshMff, the moment he arrived at the capital, ordered all his tribe to repair, with their families and effects, into the new fort which he had built for their protection. After leaving a garrison to defend this important post, where his own wealth was also lodged, he marched out, with as large a force as he could bring together, to a strong position^, some distance to the northward of Isfahan, where he fortified his encampment, with an evident resolu tion to put every thing to hazard upon the fate of one battle: T4m ^P' who had ' ^ the day his father resigned the crown, proceed to assumed the name of King of Persia, thought himself certain, after victory he had gained at Ddmghan, of ascending the throne of his ancestors, and anxiously desired to proceed to Isfahan: but his ambitious general was alarmed, lest the sight of a victorious prince entering that capital as a conqueror should eclipse his own glory, and obtain Tdmdsp a personal power that might frustrate his future schemes of aggrandizement. He, therefore, persuaded the t .. mOIiarch that 11 was more advisable he should remain at to Efrom am § han ' attended by five or six thousand men, and allow him to his intention, advance against Ashrdff.

At every stage of his advance his army received reinforcements. All raar ches to ^ 0 encounter the ranks anticipated the downfal of the Affghans, and all were anxious Affghans. to have a share in the victory over their barbarous oppressors. Nadir was too sensible of the advantage he derived from these impressions to check the ardour which they inspired; and though he found AshrafF strongly entrenched, he determined to make an instant attack on his lines. These were defended with valour; but nothing could resist the numbers and fury of the assailants. The loss of the Persians was not great, but the AfFghans left four thou- a. d. 1729. sand of their bravest men on the field of battle*. They fled into the Over whom he City of Isfahan, which they did not reach till after sunset. It was at ^ lns first proclaimed that they had obtained a victory ; but the loud wail- ings from the citadel, raised by their women, soon told the real result of the battle.

Their old men, women, and children, were mounted upon mules and camels; and, after they The Affghans had packed up all the treasure and spoil they could carry, they departed ^fshiTaz. before break of day towards Shiraz, by a route distant from that on ^ which the Persian army was expected to advance. The rage and despair of the AfFghans were so great, that a massacre of the in habitants was expected.

The leader of the Persian troops was either too prudent or too politic to pursue his enemies into the City of Isfahan. When he heard of their flight, he sent a detachment to guard the royal palace, and quiet the minds of the inhabitants; and three days after the action he entered the capital *. The first measure he adopted was to make a diligent search for the Affghans that had been left, or had re mained from choice: all these were publicly executed, except such as the inhabitants requested might be saved, on account of the mo deration and humanity with which they had acted when they enjoyed power. The remains of Sultan Mahmood were abandoned by Nddir to the fury of the populace: and a noble edifice, which had been raised over the body of the Affghan prince, was in an instant levelled with the ground, and the place where he had been interred was converted into a common sewer, to receive the filth of the city: an act of unmanly vengeance, but worthy of those who had basely submitted to his cruel tyranny. Shah TdmAsp, the moment he heard of the success of his troops, left Teheran, to which he had advanced, and arrived in Isfahan soon after it was evacuated by the Atfghans. Though received with acclamation and joy, almost every object he viewed was calculated to inspire grief: and we must judge favourably of the heart of this weak prince when informed, that he burst into tears as he walked through the solitary and defaced halls of his glorious ancestors. But * Hanway, Vol. II. page 276.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 39 his feelings had a still greater trial to support: he knew that AshrM', chap. xvi. when he slew his father, had carried off all the females of the royal family; and his astonishment may be conceived, when he entered the interior apartments, to find himself clasped to the bosom of an old woman, who called him her dear son. He was soon satisfied she was his mother, who had escaped the fate of the other sultanas and princesses, from being unknown. She had disguised herself as a slave when Mahmood took the capital; and had not only worn the dress, but performed the lowest menial duties of the rank she as sumed for a period of seven years*. Tihmisp urged his general to pursue the Affghans, as every day N&amp;dirKooiiis sent in pursuit brought accounts of the dreadful excesses which they committed : of the enemy. but N£idir Kooli, who had already been appointed commander of the army, and Governor of the Province of Khorassan, required the power of levying money on the country as essential to enable him to bring the war to a speedy and successful issue. Tam^sp was sensible that to comply with this demand was little less than to cede the sovereignty of the empire: but the soldiers would act under no other chief, and the principal nobles even recommended the measure. The monarch gave way; and N£idir marched the Obtains a . i i • P ow er to raise moment his desire was granted It was the depth of winter, and his money, troops suffered extremely from the great severity of the season, and the want of supplies; for AshrM* had laid the whole country waste: but these were the only obstacles he had to encounter, for the dispirited Affghans, who had assembled near Persepolis to give him battle, fled the moment they were attacked f, and * Hanway, Vol. II. page 278. t This battle, or rather route, took place the fifteenth of July, 1730.—H anway, Vol. II. page 280.chap . xvi. entered Shiraz in the greatest confusion.

The precipita- pe«. 6 15 tion and confusion of the flight of the AfFghans, and their ultimate destruction, are described in glowing colours by an historian*, who witnessed the scenes he has so well portrayed. They amounted, when at Shiraz, to more than twenty thousand men. These, divided under different leaders, took distinct routes. They were closely pursued by the Persians, who traced them by the dead horses and camels they left on the road, and by the slaughtered bodies of old men, women, and children; who, when unable to keep up, had been put to death by their own relations and friends, to prevent their falling into the hands of an enraged enemy. Ashr&amp;ff had sent his brother to the sea coast, charged with considerable treasure, to bribe the Governor of Bus- sorah to give him his aid : but the inhabitants of that part of the Pro vince of L4r through which this party had to march, attacked and slew the chief and all his followers, and obtained an immense booty. Excited by the success of these peasants, a few Persian captives rose upon the Affghan garrison of L4r, and put them to the sword. * MSS. of Shaikh Mahomed Aly Hazeen. THE HISTORY OF PERSIA.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 41 The genius and success of N^dir Kooli appeared, at this moment, chap, xvi. to elevate his countrymen; while the Affghans, dejected by their losses, felt all that dread they had so recently inspired. The loss of the City and Province of L^r, and the rise of all the inhabitants of Kerman, banished every hope of maintaining himself in Persia from the breast of Ashr^fF; who, taking a few followers, endeavoured to reach his native plains by the route of Seistan: but the lawless tribes of Baloochistan, who had favoured his advance in the hope of plunder, had now the same motive to cut off his retreat. He was attacked by these tribes in every direction, and, after escaping numberless dangers, was at last discovered, when wandering* in the desert, by the son of Abd^M Khan, a Baloochee, who instantly slew him, and sent his head, and a very large diamond which was Ashraff is slain found on his person, as a present to Shah Tdmdsp f. Thus terminated the life of a prince, who united many noble qualities, if not virtues, to a barbarous disposition; which was probably more the result of the situation in which he was placed, than of his natural cha racter. His own countrymen deemed him wise, moderate, and brave; and the Persians even term him the best of their savage oppressors. The miseries endured by a great proportion of the Affghans, and some of the principal chiefs, exceeded those of Ashr^ff, be cause they were more protracted. Few of them escaped death, and hardly any returned to their native country. They either perished from want and fatigue upon the desert, or were taken # Ashraff had only two attendants with hiin when he was slain. •f* MS. of Shaikh Mahomed Aly Hazeen. VOL. II.

One large division proceeded to the sea coast, where some embarked in small vessels, and went to Ldhsa, a town on the Arabian shore, nearly opposite the Island of Bahrein, where they were all slain, the moment they landed, by the cruel caution of the governor* of that port. Those who reached the shores of Mekran and Scind shared no better fate: and the respectable authorf, who relates their sufferings, informs us, that when he came to India, several years after this event, he saw a nephew of Ashrdff, and an Affghan officer of rank, called Khoddhddd Khan, who had been Governor of Mr, earning their bread by bringing water to the inhabitants of the Town of Muscat: while another noble of that nation, called Suns^r Khan, with whom he had a long con versation, obtained a scanty subsistence at the same seaport by carrying baskets of earth. Such was the termination of this remarkable invasion, But the death and captivity of the whole of the AfFghans was but a slight atonement for the great calamities which they had inflicted upon Persia. Within the short period of seven years, nearly a million of her inhabitants had perished, her finest provinces had been rendered desert, and her proudest edifices levelled with the dust; and this by enemies, who had neither the force nor the wisdom to maintain the conquest which they had made; and, consequently, never could repair the ruin they had effected. The AfFghans had no regular government in their own country that could support a * His name was Shaikh Benee Khalud. t Shaikh Mahomed Aly Hteen, whose MS. has been of great in writing this chapter.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 43 foreign conquest; and they were averse, from their habits, to that chap. xvi. complete emigration which has given permanent success to so many Tartar tribes. From the first to the last day of their rule in Persia, they were a small army of foreigners, in the midst of a great nation. Removed to a vast distance from their own country, they could expect no support in the event of a reverse of fortune; and their power had, therefore, no foundation, but in the continued fears of the multitudes by whom they were surrounded. The charm was broken by the daring spirit of N4dir Kooli: and his easy success excited a spirit among his countrymen, which was increased by a deep sense of shame at their former base and spiritless submission. The total destruction of the A ffghans, instead of restoring Tdmdsp to the sovereignty of Persia, proved only the prelude to the extinc tion of the little power which that ill-fated prince had before enjoyed. The few events connected with his name which are worthy of men tion, will find a place in the history of his victorious general; who, after triumphing over the enemies of his country, first usurped the power, and afterwards the title, of the monarch of Persia.44 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. CHAPTER XVII. V The History of Nadir Shah, and his immediate Successors. chap.xvit. T he rise of N4dir Shah from the lowest ranks of life to be the absolute monarch of his country, is an event which would attract attention, even if the guilty fame he had acquired as a conqueror and destroyer had not perpetuated his memory. The first enthusiasm of the religion of Mahomed had swept away the Sassanian dynasty *« but a bold and able leader * had, by the destruction of the power of the Caliphs of Arabia, rescued his country from the ignominy of being deemed one of the provinces of another empire, and restored it to its dignity as a kingdom. From that period it had been in pos session of Tartar chiefs, who had generally emigrated with their tribes into the milder climate of Persia, and whose power was continued, for a time, by the support of those warlike followers by whom it had been established. A revolution of a very uncommon nature had transferred the crown of Persia from these races of Tartar chiefs to the son of an ascetic-f. Several of the first of the SufFavean princes were worthy of their exalted destiny : but the last century of the rule of this family presents us with a picture that can excite no feelings but those of disgust and indignation : and such was the * Yacooh-ben-Leis.

In countries where the government is despotic, the opinion of the people is seldom heard; but it appears often in action. It is always in extremes, and generally formed by contrast. We can well conceive, that at a moment when weakness, cruelty, and debauchery, seemed the chief qualities of the sovereign, and when the nobles of the empire were only remarkable for their effeminate vices and their cowardice, that a fallen and suffering nation like Persia should have turned its eyes, with admiration and hope, on such a character as N^dir Shah. The lowness of his birth, the coarseness of his manners, and the guilty but daring actions of his early life, were all calculated to favour these impres sions, as they placed him in complete opposition to those rulers and nobles to whom they attributed all their misfortunes. Several of the events of the life of N^dir Shah have been already related; but it will be necessary to preface the account of his reign* * The life of Nadir Shah, like that of Timour, has been given by a flatterer. Meerza Mehdy, his confidential secretary, who attended him in all his expeditions, has written an account of his actions; and his work has been translated by Sir William Jones. The general credit to which this volume is entitled, is not destroyed by its being written in a strain of eulogy. The author survived his sovereign; and the free manner in which he has detailed those actions which disgraced his latter years, may be received as a proof of the authenticity of other parts of his history. But we have, in the works of Jonas Hanway, a very elaborate life of this tyrant; and the per sonal knowledge this author had of many of the facts which he records, gives it parti cular value. We have also a Memoir of Mdir written by Mr. Fraser, from Persian manuscripts he obtained in India. In addition to all these authentic materials, I46 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap. xvii . with a cursory view of those occurrences which preceded his eleva- tion to the throne of Persia. An account of The father of Nddir Shah belonged to the tribe of AfFshdr, which the family of m i • i Nadir shah, was one of those seven lurkish tribes who attached themselves to the family of the Suffavean kings. His name was Imaum Kooli; and we must from every account conclude that he was a person of no note or rank. NMr Kooli* himself never boasted of a proud genealogy: and even his flattering historianf, though he in forms us that the father of his hero was a man of some consequence in his tribe, reveals the truth by a metaphorical apology for low birth, in which he states, that the diamond has its value from its own lustre, not from that of the rock where it grew. We learn from other sources {, that he earned his livelihood by making coats and caps of sheep-skins||. Nddir often spoke of his low birth: and when the pride of the Royal House of Delhi required that his 'son^ who was to marry a princess of that family, should give an account obtained in Persia, a copy of the correspondence of this monarch, and several other valuable manuscripts which contained accounts of events connected with his life. * Kooli means' slaveNadir, 'wonderful;' and the latter term is used as an epithet to describe the Almighty. His name, therefore, signified « the slave of the « wonderful, or of God.' When he was promoted by the favour of Shah T^m^sp to the dignity of a khan, he took the name of that monarch, and was called T^misp Kooli Khan; but, on reaching the throne, he styled himself Nadir Shah, resuming his original name of Nadir, which is the one I shall use throughout his history. Meerza Mehdy, in his Life of Nadir Shah, never mentions that monarch under the name of Tamasp Kooli Khan, which leads Sir William Jones to doubt the fact of Nadir ever having assumed that appellation. + Meerza I ^^ anWay, V , 01 ' IL page 257 - II Persian MSS.

This popular attack upon the enemies of his country enabled him to obtain a second pardon from Shah T^m^sp, whose service he entered, obtains a se cond pardon and to whose cause he brought a great accession of strength and fromShahTa- m&amp;sp. reputation. Shah T^m^sp early entertained the greatest jealousy of NMir; and upon his disobeying a mandate he had sent him, to return from an expedition on which he was engaged, the weak monarch ven tured to proclaim him a rebel and a traitor. The indignant chief, the moment he heard of these proceedings, marched against the Marches against the court, which he soon compelled to submit on the terms he chose court, and ob- , . , , tains his own to dictatef. From the occurrence of this open rupture, which took terms . place soon after the conquest of Mushed, we may date the annihila tion of the little power T^mdsp had ever enjoyed. Nddir continued to treat him with respect, till he deemed the time mature for his usurpation of the throne: but we discover that, as early as his first expedition into Khorassan, he began to prepare the minds of his countrymen for his future elevation. Like Ardisheer, the founder of the Sassanian race of kings, he had his visions of future grandeur. He saw, we are told, in one of these, a water-fowl and a Nadir's dream white fish with four horns: he dreamt that he shot the bird; and, * Some oriental writers, who find nothing but virtue in the early life of N&amp;dir, inform us, that his uncle was an usurper of his right, and that his nephew, by slaying him, at once did an act of justice, and possessed himself of the means to save his country. — Eraser's History of Nadir Shah. f Meerza Mehdy's History.

The simple fact of his dreaming of a bird and a fish, he was which is informed by flattering astrologers, was a certain presage of his at- taiT^resage^f taining imperial power; and his historian-j- has had a less difficult empire. 3 ' ' 8 tas k in discovering, from subsequent events, that the four horns of the fish were types of the kingdoms of Persia, Khaurizm, India, and Tartary, which were all destined to be conquered by his hero. Such trifles are not unworthy of notice; they show the art or superstition of him who uses or believes in them, and portray, better than the most elaborate descriptions, the character of those minds upon which they make an impression.

The disgrace of this engagement was aggravated, by severalprovin- ces. its containing no stipulation for the release of the Persians who had been made prisoners during the war. The moment that Nddir received accounts of the peace, it Nadir takes advantage of seems to have occurred to his mind, that it afforded an excellent the weakness pretext for the consummation of those projects he had so long 0 1 ecourt ' cherished: but, though bold and impatient, he was compelled to proceed with caution to the extinction of a race of kings to whom obedience had become a habit, and who were, at that moment, repre sented by a prince, who, though weak and despicable, was endeared to many of his subjects by his misfortunes. His first step was to issues a pro- clamation, in issue a proclamation, in which he inveighed with bitterness against which he in- a treaty which bounded the great empire of Persia by the river gainst the Araxes, and left many of the inhabitants of that kingdom prisoners c0 ^ in the hands of cruel enemies.

Though that chief had revived the military spirit of * Meerza Mehdy's History.

At the same time that N^dir published the proclamation which has been mentioned, he addressed letters to all the military chiefs of the Nadir's letter country. In that to the Governor of Fars, which has been preserved* to the Gover- r • i • • * nor of Fars, he informs him of the great success he has had against the Affghans, and of the conquest of Herat. He then proceeds to state the asto nishment and indignation with which he has learnt the particulars of the treaty concluded with Turkey. « You will no doubt,^ he observes, ' be rejoiced to hear, that, as it was to be hoped from the ' goodness of God, this peace with the Turks is not likely to endure; ' and you may rest in expectation of my approach: for, by the blessing of the Most High, I will advance immediately, with an army elated with success, skilled in sieges, numerous as emmets, valiant as lions, and combining with the vigour of youth the ' prudence of age.

This conduct increased his reputation and popularity to so great a degree, that recruits from every part of Persia hastened to join his standard; and in less than three months after this action, Nadir descended again into the plains of Bagdad, with an army more numerous than before. His brave antagonist, Topdl Osman, had jealous rivals at the Court of Constantinople; and these, alarmed at the great fame he had acquired, not only prevented, by their intrigues, his being rein forced with men, but, by withholding the supplies of money that were necessary to pay his troops, compelled him to separate his force. He, nevertheless, made the greatest efforts to oppose this second invasion of Nddir. He sent a corps of cavalry to arrest the progress of the Persians: but the latter, eager for revenge, made such a sudden and furious attack on this body, that they completely routed it. On hearing this intelligence, the Turkish general advanced with all the troops he had been able to draw together to its support; but his own army partook of the panic of their flying comrades. Topal Osman endeavoured in vain to rally them. He was himself so infirm, that he always rode in a litter. His attendants, in the hope that he might escape, lifted him (when the flight became general,) upon a horse: but his rich dress attracted the eyes of a Persian soldier, who pierced him with his lance, and then separating his head from his body, carried it to his commander.

He was raised to the high but dangerous dignity of prime vizier in 1731, and his first act was to desire the French ambassador to write for his benefactor. « Bid him make haste,' said Topil Osman, « for we viziers seldom last long.' He had, before he was promoted to this high station, repaid Arnaud tenfold for his ransom ; but he now loaded him with caresses and favours, and made a glory of presenting to the whole court the virtuous and generous man, to whom he owed his life and liberty. When TopEl Osman was removed from the office of vizier, he publicly returned thanks to Heaven at his having been released with honour from such a burden. He was afterwards raised to the com mand of the Turkish armies on the Persian frontier, and terminated his life as has been described. * Meerza Mehdy's History.

He met with no resistance of any consequence before he reached that city; but he found its defences were too formidable to give him hopes of its early sur render. His first resolution was to subdue it by blockade; and he not only made permanent cantonments for his army in its vicinity, but ordered the lines of a new city to be traced out, which he called its vicinity for N^dir^bAd, or ' the abode of Nadir*.' He also built towers all round a new city, * which is called Candahar, and so connected them with small batteries, that it became Nadir&amp;bS,d. . - i •• . impossible tor the besieged to maintain any intercourse with the sur rounding country f. Observing, however, that the AfFghans were not intimidated by the indications which his conduct gave of his deter mined resolution to conquer them, and that they had still abundance of provisions, he was compelled, after a year had been wasted in the Commences blockade, to commence a more active course of operations The more active i * Td'Ttss City 0f Candahar stood on the face of a and was defended by a A.

The Persians made them selves masters of some of the most commanding eminences, to which they conveyed, with incredible labour, both cannon and mortars. Aided by the fire of these, they successively assailed the different towers. At some they were repulsed with great loss; at others they succeeded : but the bravery of the corps of Bukhteedrees, who have been before mentioned, was successful in carrying a principal tower, * After Candahar was taken, almost all the inhabitants removed to this new city, wbch, after the death of its founder, received the name of Candahar.

The governor, however, with the principal part of the garrison, still held out in a detached fort; but, seeing that resistance was vain, he offered to capitulate: and Nddir readily gave Candahar ca- . pitulates. him a promise of forgiveness and protection. It appears at this period to have been the policy of the conqueror to conciliate the Affghans. He had, in a very great degree, disarmed the prejudices of that nation, by the proclamation which he issued on ascending the throne against the tenets of the Sheahs; and he now sought, not merely to soften their resentment, but to attach them to his person and government by favours. He completely succeeded : some of the tribes of that nation continued, during his life, to rank among the bravest soldiers of his army, and formed a powerful check upon the discontent and turbulence of his own countrymen.

N4dir at the same time addressed letters to Nadir recalls iiim. the King of the Usbegs, and to the other chiefs of that part of Tartary, informing them, that he had sent orders to his son to retreat within the limits of the Persian empire, and not to disturb countries which were the inheritance of the race of Chenghiz Khan, and of high Turkoman families. His motives This conduct, which was evidently the result of that policy which for doing so. affects moderation, that it may better accomplish its ambitious pur poses, has been ascribed by some to a jealousy which they conceive NMir, «ven at this early period, entertained of the rising reputation of his son: but those who impute it to this cause, forget that Reza Kooli, when he returned, was not only received with extraordinary favour and affection, but soon afterwards was intrusted with all the power of a sovereign, and left to govern Persia, while his father proceeded with his vast designs of subjugating to his authority the distant regions of India. SssLnt When Nadir shah marched a g ainst 'he Affghans, he had sent an the Emperor ambassador to Dehli, requesting the monarch of India would give or Delhi. o orders to the governors of his northern provinces not to permit the enemies of Persia to find a refuge from an avenging sword, in the territories of an ally*. No satisfactory answer had been received to this mission: and, while the Affghans were allowed to take shelter within the limits of the Indian empire, obstacles were thrown in the way of the return of the Persian envoy. Ncidir, incensed at these proceedings, pursued the fugitives to Cabul, and not only made himself * Meerza Mehdy's History.

Before the events which attended this memorable expedition Condition of India at the are narrated, it may be useful to make some observations on period of its r- i • 1*1 1 1 con q uest by the actual condition of that great empire, which was threatened Nadir shah, with destruction. India had been frequently overrun by th6 hardy warriors of the north. Since the invasion of Mahmood of Ghizni, Hindoo princes had ceased to reign ; and it had con tinued subject to different dynasties of Mahomedan monarchs, who, in their turns, were overthrown by powerful conquerors. The de structive sword of Timour had desolated those fields which, after a series of extraordinary revolutions, were destined to flourish under his descendants; and the scenes of his bloodiest and most inhuman massacres, by a strange vicissitude of fortune, became those in which his name, as the renowned ancestor of a long race of emperors, was most venerated. * Meerza Mehdy's History.

His descendant, Baber, had been driven from his own inherit ance* on the banks of the Jaxartes by the superior numbers of the Usbegs; but, supported by the attachment of his followers, and his own great qualities, he first established himself in the country of Cabul, and then made himself master of the throne of Dehli, which attained its greatest splendour under his grandson, the celebrated Ackbar. We may date the commencement of its decline from the death of that truly great sovereign: but the appearance, if not the reality, of its former glory was revived by the art, the wisdom, and the valour, of Aurungzebe-f*, who was the last prince of the race of Timour that ever enjoyed real power: for, besides that common cause of dissolution in all such empires, the turbulence and rebellion of those families of high nobles who, from the constitution of its government, were intrusted with great military power, and the charge of distant provinces, a race of Hindoos had arisen in the southern parts of India, who threat ened, by their bold and incessant depredations, to retaliate upon their Mahomedan conquerors all the evils which those had inflicted upon their ancestors. The Marhattas, among whom are found the four classes of Hindoos, derive their name from the ancient appellation of that region of India of which they are natives. They are, to speak in the language of modern geography, inhabitants of the Deckan. They first became formidable in the reign of Shah Jehan: and, during thirty years that Aurungzebe passed in the southern pro- The province of Ferghanah. f The great-grandson of Ackbar. J Maharashtra.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 73 vinces of his empire, his chief occupation was to subdue the Mar- chap.xvii. hattas; but this he found impossible, for they never awaited his attack. The country was laid waste, and his troops continually harassed by men, who, from the lightness of their frames, were no burden to their horses; and who, from habits of hardihood and abstemiousness, required little either for shelter or support. It seemed in vain to war with a foe who was intangible, and whose glory lay in the rapidity of his retreat; for the Marhatta soldier, though brave, boasts more of his power to elude, than to attack his enemy. When the empire of India fell to pieces at the death of Aurung- zebe, and Mahomedan princes and nobles were all ranged against each other, the Marhattas, by continuing united, made a rapid and surprising progress. Besides the great possessions which they actually occupied, they had compelled not only the paramount sovereign of India, but almost every ruler of a province, to pay them a con siderable part of their annual collections*, that their habitations and fields might remain in safety. At the period when Nadir threatened invasion, the City of Dehli itself was subject to this disgraceful tribute-f*. Mahomed Shah, the ruling emperor, was a weak and dissolute prince. Cotemporary authors have told us, ' that he was never ' without a mistress in his arms, and a glass in his hand J:' and, hating occupation, he intrusted others with the entire management of his empire. His principal vizier was Khan Douran Khan; who. * This was levied under various names of Choute, Desmookee, &amp;c. f Sier Mutakhereen. % Nadir N&amp;m^h. vol. ii. l74 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xvii. though fond of power, was also devoted to pleasure. The chief rival of this minister was Nizam-ul-mulk, the Subadar, or Viceroy of the Deckan, who had been called to court with no friendly view, and to whose experience and wisdom his monarch had not resort till the danger became imminent and alarming. This nobleman has been accused of having invited the Persian monarch to invade India. There is, however, no proof of this fact; nor can we assign any reasonable motive for such traitorous conduct in one of the first and most powerful omrahs of the empire: but imputed treachery is ever the shield with which incompetence and cowardice seek to defend themselves. The real truth was, that the distracted and des picable Court of Dehli, sensible of their own weakness, tried to per suade themselves that Nddir would not advance. They had formed an exaggerated opinion of the strength of Candahar, and the valour of its defenders; and when they learnt its fall, they expected the Persian monarch would return to his own dominions. Even when they heard he was at Cabul, they still thought some event might compel him to retire; and this stupid infatuation was hardly dis pelled by hearing that he had crossed the Indus. Roused, however, at last to a sense of the great danger with which the empire was threatened, Mahomed Shah, attended by his court, and all the fhfhTouits tr00pS he COUld collect » marched to the plain of Karnal, a village an army, and situated on the right bank of the Jumna river, about a degree to the proceeds to _ 0 Karnal. northward of Dehli, where he surrounded his camp with entrench- a. d.1738. 1-1 a. h. 1151. nients, on which were mounted a useless train of heavy artillery. mdirs rapid The progress of Nadir from Cabul to India was rapid and and success- * fulprogress, successful: almost all the governors of the principal provinces a. h . ii6i. through which he passed, anticipated the fate of the empire byTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 75 their submission : but the conqueror has, in a letter to his son, Rez^, chap.xvk. Kooli, given us the most authentic account we could desire to possess, of events from the day on which he left Lahore, till that on which he resolved to restore the vanquished Mahomed Shah to the throne of his ancestors. After informing that prince of an Letter to his son, Rezil advantage which his troops had gained over an advanced party of Kooli. his enemies, and describing an ineffectual attempt he had made to prevent the junction of an army under Saadut Khan with Mahomed Shah, he states, that the Indian monarch considered himself so strong from this reinforcement, that he left his entrench ments, and drew up his troops in order of battle. The result will be best told in Nadir's own words. ** We,' he observes, ' whose wishes were for such a day, after Description of his battle with ' appointing guards for our camp, and invoking the support ot an the Indian ' all-powerful Creator, mounted, and advanced to the charge.

After that, by the aid ' of the Almighty, our lion-hunting heroes broke the enemy's line, ' and chased them from the field of battle, dispersing them in every ' direction*. This battle lasted two hours ; and for two hours and ' a half more were our conquering soldiers engaged in pursuit. ' When one hour of the day remained, the field was entirely cleared ' of the enemy; and as the entrenchments of their camp were strong, ' and the fortifications formidable, we would not permit our army to ' assault it, * He here enumerates the principal chiefs of the Indian arm}' that were killed, severely wounded, or taken prisoners: among the former was Khan Douran, the prime minister; and among the latter, Saadut Khan, the general.76 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap. xvii . ' An immense treasure, a number of elephants, part of the « artillery of the emperor, and rich spoils of every description, were ' the reward of our victory. Upwards of twenty thousand of the ' enemy were slain on the field of battle, and a much greater number ' were made prisoners. Immediately after the action was over, we ' surrounded the emperor's army, and took measures to prevent all ' communication with the adjacent country; preparing at the same ' time our cannon and mortars to level with the ground the fortifica- ' tions which had been erected. ' As the utmost confusion reigned in the imperial camp, and all ' discipline was abandoned, the emperor, compelled by irresistible ' necessity, after the lapse of one day, sent Nizam-ul-mulk, on ' Thursday, the seventeenth Zilkadeh*, to our royal camp; and the ' day following, Mahomed Shah himself, attended by his nobles, ' came to our heaven-like presence, in an afflicted state.

' At this time, the emperor, with his family, and all the lords of ' Hindostan, who marched from camp, are arrived at Dehli: and on ' Thursday, the twenty-ninth of Zilkadeh *, we moved our glorious ' standard toward that capital. ' It is our royal intention, from the consideration of the high ' birth of Mahomed Shah, of his descent from the House of Gurgan, &lt;e and of his affinity to us as a Turkoman, to fix him on the throne ' of the empire, and to place the crown of royalty upon his head.

The facts stated in this letter are not contradicted either by Persian or Indian historians: though the latter find reasons for the great defeat their countrymen suffered at Karnal, in the rashness of some of their leaders, and the caution of others: and they state, that even after the victory the conqueror would have returned to Persia * Corresponding with the third of March. t A full translation of this remarkable letter will be found in the tenth volume of the Asiatic Researches.78 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xvii. on receiving two millions sterling, if the disappointed ambition of an Indian omrah* had not urged him to advance to Dehli. But it is not necessary to seek for causes for the overthrow of an army, who were so panic-struck that they fled at the first charge, and nearly twenty thousand of whom were slain with hardly any loss to their enemies-f-: and our knowledge of the character of Nldir Shah forbids our granting any belief to a tale, which would make it appear, that the ultimate advantages to be obtained from this great enterprise, and the unparalleled success with which it had been attended, depended less upon his genius, than upon the petty jealousies and intrigues of the captive ministers of the vanquished Mahomed Shah. ^whth The causes which ,ed md ' ir to invade Mia have been already vasion o^in'' ' n0r Were ^ ^ouudles S . The Court of Dehli had certainly dia. not observed the established ties of friendship. It had given shelter to the Aifghans who fled from the sword of the conqueror; and this protection was likely to enable them to make another effort to regain their lost possessions, and consequently to reinvolve Persia in war. The ambassadors of Nadir, who had been sent to make remon strances on this subject, had not only been refused an answer, but were prevented from returning, in defiance of the reiterated and im patient applications of that monarch. This proceeding, we are told, * Saadut Khan, who had been taken prisoner, negotiated this agreement. He expected, as a reward, to be made prime minister; and when he heard that office was gxven to Nizam-ul-mulk, he advised Nadir Shah to advance, and obtain better terras.- S cott's Translation of the History of the Deckan, Vol. II. page 204. t Nadir is said only to have lost five hundred men: this probably is below the number. Fraser, in his life of this conqueror, states the loss of the Persians at two thousand five hundred killed : but this appears, from all other accounts, to be exag.e-THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 79 originated more in irresolution and indecision, than from a spirit of chap.xvii. hostility : but it undoubtedly furnished a fair and justifiable pretext for Nadir's advance. Regarding the other motives which induced him to undertake this enterprise, we can conjecture none but an insa tiable desire of plunder, a wish to exercise that military spirit he had kindled in the Persians, or the ambitious view of annexing the vast dominions of the Sovereign of Dehli to the Crown of Persia. But if he ever cherished this latter project, he must have been led, by a near view of the condition of the empire of India, to reject it as wholly impracticable. We are, however, compelled to respect the greatness of that mind, which could resolve, at the very moment of its achievement, upon the entire abandonment of so great a con quest : for he did not even try to establish a personal interest at the Court of Dehli, except through the operation of those sentiments, which his generous conduct in replacing him upon his throne might make upon the mind of Mahomed Shah *. # Nadir, it is true, did not wholly abstain from adding to his possessions; but the provinces he reclaimed had before belonged to Persia. In a treaty concluded with Mahomed Shah, that monarch ceded the countries beyond the Indus, which was made the boundary between the two empires. The following translation of the document by which Mahomed Shah made this cession, has been preserved by a cotemporary writer. It is an extraordinary paper, and was no doubt dictated by the conqueror. « Formerly, the ministers of his high majesty (who is exalted like Saturn, fierce as « Mars, impetuous as the god of war, king of the kings of the earth, prince of the « princes of the age, the shadow of God and refuge of Islam, in pomp like Alexander, « the heavens his court, the sultan who is merciful, and the emperor who is august, « N^dir Shah, may God perpetuate his reign,) had sent ambassadors to this court, to « treat of certain affairs, which I intended to comply with : afterwards Mahomed Khan « Turkoman arrived from Candahar, to remind me thereof; but my ministers and agents80 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. ^ rxvit . Nddir claimed, as a prize which he had won, the wealth of the Nsldir seizes emperor, and a great proportion of that of his richest nobles and sures. subjects. The whole of the jewels that had been collected by a having delayed the ambassadors, and postponed an answer to his majesty's letter, ' raised such a misunderstanding between us, that his successful army, having come to ' the confines of Hindostan, both parties encountered in the fields of Karnal; where, ' a ^ ter a ro y al battle was fought, as Providence would have it, victory, to appearance, ' rose from the east of his undeclining fortune. As his high majesty, who is mighty as « Jemsheed, and the greatest of the Turkomans, is the source of goodness and prowess, « relying on his honour, and trusting to his support, I had the satisfaction of an inter- ' view, and enjoyed the pleasure of being entertained in his paradise-like company. « After which, we came together to Shahjehanabad, where I brought forth to his view, ' and with the P ro P er ceremony presented to him, all the treasure, jewels, and precious ' effects of the Hindostan emperor. His majesty, in compliance with my request, ' accepted of some: and out of the greatness of his soul, and abundant humanity, in ' regard to the illustrious family of Gurgan, and the honour of the original tree of ' Turkan, was graciously pleased to restore to me the crown and gem of Hindostan. ' In consideration of this favour, which no father shows to a son, nor no brother to « a brother, I make over to him all the countries to the west of the River Attock, the ' water of Scind, and Nala Sunkra, which is a branch of the water of Scind : that is to « say, Paishawur with its territories, the principality of Cabul, Ghuznavi, the mountain- ' ous residences of the Affghans, the Hazarijat and the passes, with the Castle of Buckar, Sunkar, and KhodMdad: the rest of the territories, passes, and abodes of the « Chokias, Baloochees, &amp;c., with the Province of Tatta, the Castle of Ram, and the « Village of Terbin, the towns of Chun, Sumawali, and Ketra, &amp;c., places dependent ' on Tatta: all their fields, villages, castles, towns, and ports, from the first rise of the « R.ver Attock, with all the passes and habitations which the abovesaid water and its « several branches comprehend and surround, as far as Nala Sunkra, where it empties ' ltself loto the sea - In short, all places westward of the River Attock, and those parts, ' and westward of the River Scind, and Nala Sunkra, I have annexed to the do- « minions of that powerful sovereign; and, from henceforth, his agents and servants may entei upon and set about the management and the securing of the abovesaidTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 81 long race of sovereigns, and all the contents of the imperial trea- chap.xvii. sury, were made over by Mahomed Shah to the conqueror.

The approach of Nadir Shah to Dehli had filled the inhabitants of that city with dread; but the strict discipline which his troops observed on their first* arrival, restored confidence to all.

Before he quitted it, NMir'sadvic® . i • i totheemperor he had a long and secret conference with Mahomed Shah, in which and his officers it is supposed he gave him such counsel as he deemed best, to enable quitting Dehli. him to preserve that power to which he was restored. To all the nobles of the court he spoke publicly, and warned them to preserve their allegiance to the emperor, as they valued his favour, or dreaded his resentment. To those who were absent he wrote in similar terms: he informed them, that he was so united in friendship with Mahomed Shah, that they might be esteemed as having one soul in two bodies: and, after desiring them to continue to walk in the path of duty to the Imperial House of Timour, he concluded these circular letters in the following words: ' May God forbid! but if accounts of your ' rebelling against your emperor should reach our ears, we will blot ' you out of the pages of the book of creation.' The conqueror had behaved with considerable moderation and kindness towards the chief omrahs of the Court of Dehli; but he must have despised their luxurious and effeminate habits. We, indeed, learn his sentiments from a remarkable anecdote. When speaking one day to Kummer-u-deen, who was then vizier, he demanded how many ladies he had*? ' Eight hundred and fifty,' * A chief of the tribe of Affshar informed me, that his father (who was one of Nadir's generals,) used often to praise the great continence of that monarch, who never, be said, had more than two wives with him when in the field, and was displeased with any leader who was accompanied by more than one.86 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap. xvii . was the reply.—' Let one hundred and fifty of our female ' captives,' said Nddir, ' be sent to the vizier, who will then be entitled to the high military rank of a Mim-b^shee, or ' 4 commander of a thousand tlrplunder T ^ e marcl1 of Nddir from India was literally encumbered with obuinedhy spoil. The amount of the plunder that he carried from that country has been estimated variously. The highest calculation makes it upwards of seventy millions sterling; the lowest is considerably more than thirty. A great part of this was in precious stones, of which Nddir was immoderately fond. When on his march from India, he was informed that several of the most valuable crown jewels had been secreted by some of his followers. He made this a baggage 5 of pretext for sear ching the baggage of every man in his army, and LTfs ar m m ;: a PP ro P riatin g a11 the jewels that were found to himself.

He was, however, in general kind and liberal to his troops: he had given to each man a gratuity of three months' pay at the fall of CandaharJ; he gave them as much more after the victory of Karnal; and they received a still greater bounty before he marched from Dehli. * Persian MS. t Hanway, who records the parlioulars of this oecurrenee, says, some of the soldiers were so enraged, that they threw the jewels they had plundered into the river Indns, on the banks of which they were encamped, rather than deliver them to the officers appointed to search— Hanway , Vol. II. p ag e 392.

Sanguine minds were led, by a natural association of ideas, to believe that their present ruler was the destined restorer of their country to its former glory; and the * Hanway, Vol. II. page 392.88 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap.xvii . conqueror was hailed, at his return, as a hero, whose fame had eclipsed that of a Sapor, or a Nousheerwan. The soldiers of N4dir were, we are informed, after the expedition to India, most anxious for repose: but that prince was too well ac quainted with the consequences of this indulgence to permit them to Nadir attacks enjoy it. He had, after he passed the Indus, led them through the the ruler of t &amp; sdnd. deserts of Scind to the attack of a feudatory chief, who had esta blished himself in the government of that province*. This ruler had courted Nddir Shah when he first threatened the invasion of India, as he deemed such a measure favourable to his views of independence; * I find the following account of this transaction in a Memoir, transmitted by Mr. N. H. Smith, late envoy from the supreme government of India to the ruler of Scind. In the reign of Mahomed Shah, when the alarm excited by the threatened invasion of India by N^dir Shah had become general, Meer Noor Mahomed Ubassee Caloree, whose hereditary possessions consisted of the province of ' Sewee, also called Seree, and other districts, and who not only exercised the ' functions of executive power in those provinces, but possessed a spiritual autho rity over several military chiefs, who considered themselves bound to pay him « obedience on the ground of the sanctity of his family, availed himself of the appre- ' hensions of Sadiq Ulee Khan, the Soubahdar of Scind on the part of Mahomed ' Shah, respecting the attempts of Mdir Shah to persuade that officer, in the 1150th ' year of the Hejirah, to transfer the government of Scind to him for the sum of three ' lacks of rupees, part of which sum has remained unpaid to the present day. Nadir « Shah, having in the year 1152 of the Hejirah defeated the Caloree army, compelled « the chiefs of the family to take refuge in Amerkote, a fort situated in the desert. « An arrangement, however, was ultimately made, by which the Calorees were per- ^ ^ ^ t ^ e con( l ueror to retain the government of Scind, on condition of paying ^yearly tribute to the sovereigns of Persia: and this appears to have been regularly « paid by the first of these princes.

Abool Fyze Khan, who was the ruler of the Usbegs at this period, boasted a lineal descent from Chenghiz: but he appears to have inherited none of the spirit of his great ancestor. He was terrified into submission at the approach of N4dir, and sent his vizier to deprecate the wrath of that tuZTs. rnonarch - The mini ster was well received ; but told, that his master must immediately surrender, if he desired to save himself from destruc tion, and his country from ruin* While these negotiations were carried on, the Persian army advanced, by rapid marches, to Bokha- rahf; and on the twenty-third of August, five days after they had crossed the Oxus, encamped within twelve miles of that capital, * Meerza Mehdy's History.

This treaty was cemented by an alliance between the daughter of the ruler of Bokh^rah and the nephew of his conqueror; and, after its conclusion, a great number of Tartars were, with the concurrence of their own monarch, enrolled in the Persian army, whose commander probably esteemed the services of these hardy warriors as of more consequence to the peace of his own dominions, and the fulfilment of his future views of ambition, than all the wealth he had brought from India. The arms of N^dir were next directed against the kingdom of md\r makes Khaurizm, which is situated to the westward of Bokharah, and ^^0™° of 6 stretches along both banks of the Oxus, to the shores of the Cas- Khaurizm ' pian Sea. The prince of this country (whose name was Ilburz,) neither merited nor received such humane treatment as Abool Fyze Khan. He had committed frequent depredations upon the Persian territories; and, conceiving that the strength of his fortresses would secure him from vengeance, he resolved on resistance. The King whose ruler of Bokharah had sent a mission to advise him to submit to the sis'tancT' arms of Nddir: he not only treated this friendly counsel with disdain, but, in violation of laws which the most savage nations respect, he slew those through whom it was conveyed. This conduct greatly irritated the monarch of Persia, who, after he had defeated hisTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. army and made him prisoner, doomed him, and twenty of his chief officers, to death*. The possessions of Ilburz were bestowed upon Taher Khan, a cousin of the sovereign of Bokharah, and consequently a direct descendant of the celebrated Chenghiz-f. When the winter of this year was far advanced, Nddir marched to Kelat J, to which place he continued from his most early years to be much attached. He had directed that its fortifications should be improved; that a palace should be built; and that aqueducts should be constructed to improve the fertility of its fields. He had also ordered, that all his treasures should be carried thither: and a peaceful retirement to this cherished spot, after the toils and * Meerza Mehdy's History.

It is a very high hill, accessible only by two narrow paths.

The inhabitants of the mountains live in tents; and the only buildings ' in this delightful valley are two towers, and a small marble edifice erected by Nadir. « The towers were intended for the defence of the paths, and the house for the use of ' his majesty. On quitting the valley, you continue to ascend; and, after travelling about fifteen miles, gain the summit of the mountain, on which is another plain, not « so large, but equal in fertility to the former. Here are also two small towers, which « command the approaches, and are the only fortifications on the Castle of Kelat; the « strength of which, like the Kela Sufeed, consists in the steepness of the rock, and in ' the difficulty of access to it.

After a short residence at Kelat, Nddir proceeded to Mushed, Proceeds which he had made the capital of his empire; and, during three whid^ht' months that he remained in this city, his time was passed in constant Tphai festivities. Five* monarchs had been subdued in five years. The empire of Persia had not only been rescued from a foreign yoke, but A,H * 1154 - its limits had been extended as far as the Oxus to the north, and the Indus to the east; and the hero, by whom all this had been accomplished, promised his exulting subjects that the Turks should soon be driven from the banks of the Tigris and the Euphrates: but honour required that, before any other expedition was under taken, N^dir should revenge the blood of his brother, Ibrahim Resolves to Khanf, who had been slain in an attack of the Lesghees. blood 8 of his When the army was on its march to Daghestan, an event occurred ^Khan.^' which cast a dark cloud over all the fair prospects that dawned upon Persia, and exhibited, in the strongest view, the miserable condition of those empires whose fate hangs upon the disposition and talents of a despotic sovereign. An advanced corps, chiefly composed of a.d . mi.

The prince, Reza Kooli, who was near him, galloped N^dir is o jr wounded by towards the spot from which the shot had been fired: but neither an assassin. his efforts, nor those of the guards that aided him, could succeed in the attempt to seize the fugitive, who, favoured by the thickness of who escapes, the wood, effected his escape.

This accident, though it made a deep and indelible impression upon the mind of N^dir, did not prevent his proceeding to attack the Lesghees : but he never engaged in an enterprise of more hazard. The Lesghees These mountaineers defended themselves with the most desperate defend them- 1 selves with bravery : and the rugged nature of the whole country of D^ghestan, bravery. which they inhabit, made it almost impossible to subdue them. The bravest troops of the Persian army were worn out with the fatigue of this harassing war : and the preparations which the Russians began to make at Astracan, though dictated by a fear that Nadir meant to invade their country after he had subdued the Lesghees gave the latter every encouragement to persevere # Meerza Mehdy. f Meerza Mehdy, the historian of N&amp;dir, states, that the name of this person was Aga Meerza, the son of Delavur, the chief of the tribe of Taitnni. The assassin's name was Neek-Kuddum, who, he asserts, confessed his crime, and therefore only lost his eyes. J We meet with the following observations of Hanway on this subject:— The Lesghees had intimated their desire of putting themselves under the protec tion of Russia, from the time of Nadir's first invading their country : and it certainly was the interest of that empire to support the independency of those brave moun-THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 95 in their resistance; and the Persian monarch was compelled to retire ciiap.xvil from this expedition with very partial success, and very great 0 N^dir is com- 10SS. pelled to retire ATA 1 • 1 i r* ii • w ' t ' 1 P art i a l JN [ adir had, from the day on which his life was attempted, enter- success, but tained suspicions of his eldest son, Reza Kooli.

' As soon as the Russian general arrived in the neighbourhood of Daghestan, the ' Lesghees made application to him; and from an apprehension of the danger they ' might be exposed to, in case N&amp;dir was determined to prosecute his design of redu- ' cing them, they wrote to this commander as follows : ' Most honoured and most accomplished general and commander-in-chief, ' Our most humble petition consists in this: all the inhabitants of Dsighestan having ' been informed that you are arrived near the frontiers of Kislar with an imperial army, ' and that your intention is to defend and protect the subjects of her imperial majesty in Andrewska, Koslkoff^ and Baxan, as also all the chiefs and rulers of the states ' bordering on the dominions of her imperial majesty, after longing expectations of ' your arrival, we have sent our deputies in the name of the whole nation to desire your intercession, that her imperial majesty may receive us under her puissant pro- ' tection, and permit us to be her slaves.

The prince instantly obeyed; and was, on his arrival, made prisoner, and deprived of sight. A respectable Euro- a.h. 1156. pean writer^, who went to Persia two years after this event, appears Deprives his son, RezS, satisfied that the assassin who fired at Nddir in the woods of g Mazenderan, was employed by the prince, Ilez4 Kooli; who, he informs us, though brave and able, was violent and oppressive. He had, this author asserts, on hearing that N^dir was dead, when on his expedition to India, declared himself king; and, at the same time, put the unfortunate Shah Tdmasp -f-, who was confined at Subzdwar, in Khorassan, to death. The same writer assures us, that Nddir, though convinced of the guilt of his son, addressed him in the mildest and most humane terms, and offered him com plete pardon if he would only confess his crime, and promise repentance; but that the fierce youth rejected this offer, and said he gloried in the attempt he had made to rid the world of a tyrant, and provoked his fate by the coarsest abuse of his father and sove reign. It is probable that this author received the account which he has given of this transaction from some person who was desirous of palliating the guilt of a reigning tyrant; but we are compelled to refuse our credit to this statement. , The flattering historian of Ncidir expressly informs us, that that sovereign was deceived, by the gross misrepresentations of infamous men, into the commission of this great crime.]:.

From the moment that his life had been attempted in Mazenderan, that monarch had become gloomy and irritable. His bad success against the Lesghees had increased the natural violence of his temper; and, listening to the enemies of Rez4 Kooli -j-, he, in a moment of rage, ordered him to be blinded. ' Your crimes have forced me to this dreadful measure,^ was, we are told, the speech that N4dir made to his son. ' It is not my eyes ' you have put out/' replied Rez4 Kooli, ' but those of Persia J/' The prophetic truth of this answer sunk deep into the soul of N^dir; and we may believe his historian, who affirms that he never after wards knew happiness, nor desired that others should enjoy it. All his future actions were deeds of horror, except the contest which he carried on against the Turks for three years; and even in it he displayed none of that energy and heroic spirit which marked his first wars with that nation. # Lettres Edifiantes, Vol. IV. page 294. t I have conversed with the descendants of several of Nadir's chief omrahs, who all concurred in the truth of Meerza Mehdy's statement of this fact.

But the possession of riches chap.xvii. had soon its usual effect of creating a desire for more: and while the vast treasures he had acquired were hoarded at the Fort of Kelat, which, with all the fears of a despot, he continually laboured to render inaccessible, he not only paid his armies, but added to his golden heaps from the arrears of remitted revenue, which he ex torted with the most inflexible rigour. N^dir knew that the attack which he had made upon the religion of his country had rendered him unpopular; and that the priests, whom he peculiarly oppressed, endeavoured to spread disaffection. This made him suspect those who still adhered to the tenets of the Sheah sect; or, in other words, almost all the natives of Persia. The troops in his army upon whom he placed most reliance were the Affghans and Tartars, who were of the Soonee persuasion. Their leaders were his principal favourites ; and every pretext was taken to put to death such Persian chiefs as possessed either influence or power. These proceedings had the natural effect of producing rebel lion in every quarter^, and the spirit of insurrection which now dis played itself among his subjects changed the violence of N^dir into outrageous fury. His murders were no longer confined to individuals : the inhabitants of whole cities were massacred : and men, to use the words of his historian-f, left their abodes, and took up their habita tions in caverns and deserts, in the hope of escaping his savage ferocity.

The wretched condition of his native country was calculated to excite in the ardent mind of N^dir the most noble ambition: and when we reflect on the success which attended his first efforts against the Affghans, we are almost reconciled to his usurpation of the name of that sovereign power, the substance of which he had long enjoyed, and which he could not have resigned without The physician Bazin states, that Nadir had informed the chief of the Affghans that he entirely reposed on the fidelity of his corps, and that he meant they should next day seize and imprison all the officers of his guards.— Edifiantes, Vol. IV. page 313.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. ^ extreme danger, both to himself, and to a nation which had been chap.xvii. saved by his valour and his genius. After expelling the barbarous invaders of his country from the central provinces of Persia, and after obtaining the most signal victories over the Turks, the next labour of N^dir was to restore the throne to its former glory: and when he had conquered Can- dahar and Cabul, he sought (and with success) to add to the strength of the empire, by converting the most dangerous of her enemies into the bravest of her defenders. The causes of his ex pedition to India have been explained; and, though it brought misery to thousands, there, perhaps, never was a conquest of such magnitude made by an Asiatic prince, with less crime to the indi vidual by whom it was accomplished. The riches and the renown which he obtained by this enterprise, gave him great means of restoring Persia to all her ancient splendour; and his invasion of the territories of Bokharah, while it was the best, and indeed the only way in which he could secure the continued tranquillity of his own possessions, added, perhaps, still more to his fame and to his power. His generous treatment of the humbled monarch of that country, and his conduct to the Emperor of India, showed that Nadir de sired to trust more to the impressipn of his arms, than to the extent of his dominions, for the future security of his power. Hitherto this monarch, whether we consider the noble and patriotic object which first stimulated his ambition^ the valour and ability he displayed, the comparative moderation with which he used success, or the glorious deeds he had done, is entitled to great, if not unqualified admiration. The dreadful change which took place in his disposition and character, has been stated. Prom the moment102 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xvn. that his mind was subdued by avarice and suspicion, he became one of the most cruel of tyrants: and Persia, by a strange destiny, seemed doomed to receive her death from that hand, to which she, a few years before, had owed her existence. 'When the mind of Nddir was in its most disturbed and phrensied state, he still continued to brood over those plans which he had cherished in his happier days. He anxiously desired to encourage trade; and thought that his country would not only become more wealthy, but more powerful, if he could form a navy. The aid of an enterprising, but indiscreet Englishman*, enabled him to com mence the execution of this project on the Caspian ; but the effort produced no benefit to Persia; and, by exciting the jealousy of Russia, proved destructive to an infant branch of commerce, which British merchants had established in that quarter. Nddir had also ordered ships to be built on the shores of the Persian Gulf; and, with the true spirit of an unreflecting despot, commanded that timber for that purpose should be conveyed from the forests of Mazenderan, a distance of more than six hundred miles, and that through a country which had neither canals, roads, nor wheel carriages. The oppressed inhabitants of the intervening provinces were compelled to contribute their labour to this object, which was never accomplished. The rude ribs of an ill-constructed vessel were ten years ago to be seen on the beach at Abusheher, and seemed as if spared to be the emblem of the folly of this attempt f. • The name of this persoa was Ellon: for an account of his proceedings, and their consequences, see the Works of Jonas Hanway. t He also directed an immense quantity of marble to be carried from jiderbijan, to ornament h.s palaces at Kelat and Mushed; the transportation of which, caused almostTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 103 We have a remarkable instance of the anxiety with which Nadir chap.xvii. desired to encourage commerce, in the conduct he observed towards our countryman, Hanway, who visited his camp three years before his death, and at a period when Persia was devastated by his oppres sion and cruelty. The monarch commanded that all the losses which this eminent merchant had sustained by the rebellion at Asterabad, should be made good, either by the recovery of his merchandise*, or from the sale of the property of those by whom he had been plundered. as much misery as the conveying of the timber did. In 1810 I visited the quarry where this marble was found, and saw a great number of half-finished blocks, that had lain untouched since his death. This quarry is on the banks of the Lake of Oormia, and about eighteen miles from the Town of Maragha. # A Persian MS. in my possession relates an extraordinary and amusing anec dote of N&amp;dir at this period, which shows how completely he understood the feelings of the most ignorant and the wickedest of his subjects. A native mer chant, travelling from Cabul, had been robbed in a plain near Nishapore, and carried his complaint to the sovereign. ' Was there no one near but the robbers?' said N^dir. ' None,' was the reply. ' Were there no trees, or stones, or bushes?' ' Yes,' said the man, ' there was one large solitary tree, under whose shade I ' was reposing when I was attacked.' NS.dir, on hearing this, affected great fury, and ordered two executioners to proceed instantly, and flog the tree that had been described, every morning, till it either restored the property that had been lost, or revealed the names of the thieves by whom it had been taken. The mandate of a king of Persia is always a law; that of N^dir was considered as irre vocable as fate. The executioners proceeded ; and the tree had not suffered flagela- tion above a week, when all the goods that had been stolen were found one morning carefully deposited at its root. The alarmed robbers, who soon heard of the extrava gant cruelty that inflicted such blows upon an inanimate substance, trembled at the very thought of the horrible punishment that awaited them if ever discovered. When the result was reported to N£idir, he smiled, and said, ' I knew what the flogging of ' that tree would produce.'THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. It has been already stated, that Nddir desired to change the religion of his country. His first idea probably was to destroy, with the tenets of the Sheah sect, that devoted veneration and attachment which those who held them cherished for the Suffavean dynasty, by whom this faith had first been established as a national religion. He also desired, as has been noticed, to do away religious distinctions, which seemed likely to interfere with his schemes of ambition. We have the strongest evidence to conclude, that his conduct on this point was wholly uninfluenced by other motives than those of policy. He appears, indeed, to have had no fixed sentiments upon the subject of religion. Soon after his return from India, he had directed that the four Evangelists should be translated into Persian; and when this work was finished in a very incorrect manner by some Romish and Armenian priests, who wrote it under the snperintendance of his secretary*, he summoned some Christian priests, Jewish rabbies, and Maho- medan moollahs, to his presence f. Extracts from the imperfect translation that had been made of the New Testament were read to him, and he amused himself, and some of his hearers, with ludicrous remarks on the mysterious parts of the Christian faith. The tenets of the Jews, and the traditions of the Mahomedans, were treated with the same freedom; and the tyrant broke up this assembly of divines with a declaration, that, if God spared him, he would make a religion, much better than any of those that mankind yet possessed. • Meerza Mehd y , w h„ was aiso the author of his history.

Hanway, Vol. II. page 404.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 105 The Suffavean kings had established a powerful hierarchy in their chap.xvii. dominions, at the head of which was a Sudder-ul-Suddoor, or chief pontiff. This body, who were always possessed of much wealth, had enjoyed not only a very great share of the government, but of the revenues of the country, under the weak and bigoted Shah Sultan Hussein. The fate of that prince had brought the popular indigna tion on every measure with which his memory was associated; and N^dir, therefore, proceeded, without alarm at the consequence, to plunder the ecclesiastical revenues. We are informed *, that imme diately after he was crowned, he assembled a number of the prin cipal priests, and demanded of them in what manner the immense revenues f which they enjoyed was appropriated. They replied, ' In supporting priests, colleges, and mosques. In the latter,' they added, ' we continually offer up prayers to God for the success of ' our sovereigns.'—' Your prayers/' said N^dir, ' are evidently ' not acceptable to the Almighty, for the empire has suffered its ' greatest decline when your order was most encouraged. It has &lt;4 been rescued from destruction by my brave soldiers, who are, ' therefore, to be deemed God^s chosen instruments, and your ' wealth must henceforward be applied for their support.' At the same time that Nddir seized almost the whole of the church revenue, he abolished the duties of the chief pontiff, but left the name, and gave the person who bore it a small pension. His conduct to the priesthood, though it excited no commotion at the moment, was, perhaps, one of the most impolitic acts that he ever * Hanway, Vol. II. page 343. t Hanway calculates this amount at nearly one fifth of the revenue of the country, or about a million sterling. vol. ti. p106 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap.xvii . committed. This order became the active disseminators of sedi- tion: and, as those feelings of envy which their wealth had excited were soon changed into pity for their fallen condition, the efforts they made were very successful. Nadir was well aware of their sentiments. We are told *, that on sending one of his nobles to take charge of a distant government, he concluded his instructions by saying, ' Remember you are not to communicate with the ' moollah; but I know you will meet him at night, and talk of ' me. He will call me one of the greatest monarchs in the universe; ' but will add, that I am a villain, and that I have neither mercy ' nor justice in my composition/' The contempt in which Nddir held the arts by which the der vishes, and other religious mendicants, imposed upon the credulity of his countrymen, was shown on every occasion. Many of these believed that the holy Imaum Rezd, who is interred at Mushed, continued to work miracles; and this belief gave rise to a number of impositions. Persons, pretending to be blind, went to his tomb; and, after a long period of prayer, opened their eyes, and declared that their sight had been restored by the holy Imaum. One of these was seated at the gate of the sacred mausoleum when Nadir passed f. ' How long have you been blind said the monarch. ' Two years,' answered the man. '* A proof/' replied N^dir, ' that you have no faith. If ' you had been a true believer you would have been cured long ago. Recollect, my friend, if I come back and find you as you now are, ' I will strike your head off.' When Nddir returned, the frightened fellow pretended to pray violently, and all at once found his sight. * Hanway, Vol. II. page 446. t Persian MSS.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 107 « A miracle! a miracle the populace exclaimed, and tore off his chap.xvit. coat in small pieces, as relics. The monarch smiled, and observed, &lt;e that faith was every thing/' NMir, we are informed, was a predestinarian ; and the Persians believe, that even in his phrensied moments, when he was destroying his fellow-creatures, he thought himself an instrument of Heaven. As a proof of this, they relate the following extraordinary occur rence *. An arrow was shot into his quarters with a paper affixed, on which was written, ' If thou art a king, cherish and protect thy ' people; if a prophet, show us the path of salvation ; if a god, be ' merciful to thy creatures.' The tyrant, while he made every search for the author, commanded that copies of this paper should be distributed throughout the camp, with the following answer annexed to it. ' I am neither a king, to protect my subjects ; a prophet, to ' teach the way of salvation; nor a god, to exercise the attribute of ' mercy : but I am he, whom the Almighty has sent in his wrath, to ' chastise a world of sinners The character of this wonderful man is, perhaps, exhibited in its truest colours in those impressions which the memory of his actions has left upon the minds of his countrymen. They speak of him as a deliverer and a destroyer: but while they expatiate with pride upon his deeds of glory, they dwell with more pity than horror upon the cruel enormities which disgraced the latter years of his reign; and neither his crimes, nor the attempt he made to abolish their religion, have subdued their gratitude and veneration for the hero, who revived in the breasts of his degraded countrymen a * Persian MSS. t Han way also relates this occurrence.

His first act was to circulate a proclamation f, in which he declared, that those who had slain his uncle had acted by his order. This extraordinary document, which was meant to screen the conspirators from danger, deserves our attention, as it affords us, in the most authentic form, a proof of the impressions which had been made on all ranks by the horrid cruelties of Nddir. We discover from it, that a favourite nephew of that monarch, who owed every thing to his bounty, makes an appeal to the inhabitants of Persia to support him on the throne, on the * According to some authors, Ahmed Khan was attacked by the Persians, t All Persians agree in their account of the causes that led to the death of Nadir; and there is no doubt this declaration of Aly's was only meant to screen the murderers from future imputation and danger on that account.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 109 ground of his merit in having destroyed a despot; who, to use the chap. xvit. words of the proclamation, ' delighted in blood; and, with unheard-of ' barbarity, made pyramids of the heads of his own subjects/ , 'We ' commanded,' this prince observes, ' that Mahomed Kooli Khan ' should prevail upon the Affshdr guards to seize and remove the ' tyrant.

While Aly, who took the name of Adil Shah, or ' the just king,' Assumes the . . title of Adil was, by his professions, endeavouring to obtain popularity, his acts shah, were of a nature that showed he was at once weak and cruel.

The two former were put to death, as were also the unfortunate Reza Kooli, and thirteen of the sons and grandsons of N^dir. The only descendant of the conqueror that was spared, was his grandson Shah Rokh, who was fourteen years of age when these horrid scenes * Han way, Vol. II. page 451.110 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xvii. occurred. We are informed, that the life of this young prince was only meant to be preserved till Adil Shah was confirmed in the power he had usurped. It is also asserted that the cruel tyrant was withheld from destroying him, from a fear that the clamours of the people might demand as their ruler a prince of the blood of Nddir; and in this extreme he proposed elevating Shah Rokh to the throne, and continuing to rule Persia in his name. Adil Shah endeavoured to efface the impression made by his cruelty and his usurpation by dispensing, with a prodigal hand, the vast wealth which had been accumulated by his uncle: but even this attached none to his interests, and his reign was short and inglorious*. ttL^t He WaS defeated ' taken ' and deprived of sight, by his brother, Ibra- TD.mt' h,m Khan ' t0 Wh0m he had intrusted th e government of Irak.

But all these fair hopes were blasted by the art and ambition of an enemy, who, encouraged by the general confusion of the times, sought to obtain the crown a.d.ms. by the destruction of the prince in whose favour all voices appeared s y ud Maho- med endea- to be united.

Meer Aulum, the chief of the Arabians, triumphed, but only to fall in his turn before Ahmed Khan Abdallee. This leader has been already mentioned. Immediately after the death of Nidir he had proclaimed himself King of the Affghans, and had just added to his other conquests that of the City of Herat. He now advanced against Meer Aulum, who was defeated and slain; and the City of Mushed, after some resistance, submitted to the conqueror. Ahmed Khan was at this period in a condition to attempt the reduction of all Persia: but the prospect was not inviting. Every province of that kingdom was exhausted. The Affghans were still deemed the onginal authors of the misery that its inhabitants * One of these was Jaaffer, B ho eommanded a large body of Kurds; and the other Meer Anlnm, ,vho was the ehief of a tribe of Arabs.-P«-«„THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 113 endured; and the unsuccessful attempt which had been made to chap.xvii. alter the religion of the country, had revived, in all their vigour, those sentiments of hatred which the Persians entertained for that race as Soonees. In addition to these obstacles, the example of usurpation, which NMir Shah had given, had inspired every governor of a province, and every chief of a tribe, with the desire of rule; and Persia abounded with pretenders to regal power. a.d .irsi. a. h.1165. Under such circumstances, we must admire that wisdom which led the Affghan prince to withdraw from this scene of turbulence, that he might exclusively direct his future exertions to the nobler and more legitimate object of establishing a power in his native country; which, while it gave a crown to his descendants, raised his nation to a rank and consideration far beyond what they had ever enjoyed. Before Ahmed Khan left Khorassan, he assembled the prin cipal chiefs, and proposed that the province which gave birth to Nddir should be separated from Persia, and converted into a principality for his unfortunate grandson*. They all agreed, and promised continued allegiance; cherishing, no doubt, an expectation, that an arrangement which placed a blind and inefficient prince at their head, was the most favourable for their individual views of aggrandizement. Ahmed became the guarantee of the independence of Khorassan, which, he justly concluded, would hereafter form a strong barrier to guard his dominions from the ambition of whatever ruler might succeed in obtaining the Crown of Persia. vol. ii. # Persian MSS.

Reign of Kurreem Khan, Zund. The History of Persia, from the death of N&amp;dir Shah till the chap -^ 1 elevation of Aga Mahomed Khan, the founder of the reigning family, though it occupies nearly half a century, presents to our attention no one striking feature, except the life of Kurreem Khan, Zund*. The happy reign of this excellent prince, as contrasted with those who preceded and followed him, affords to the historian of Persia that description of mixed pleasure and repose which a traveller enjoys, who arrives at a beautiful and fertile valley, in the midst of an arduous journey over barren and rugged wastes. It is pleasing to recount the actions of a chief, who, though born in an inferior rank, obtained power without crime, and who exer cised it with a moderation that was, in the times in which he lived, as singular as his humanity and justice. When Ahmed Khan was employed in settling the province of Khorassan, Mahomed Hussein Khan, chief of the tribe of Kujurs, (and grandfather to the present King of Persia,) had established himself at Asterabad; a town situated on the eastern shores of the Caspian, which had long been the residence of his family: and the * Zund was the name of his tribe, or clan.116 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap.xviii whole of Mazenderan had submitted to his authority. The father * of this chief had been murdered by Nadir Shah; and the tribe of Kujurs cherished, in consequence, a blood feud against the descend ants of that monarch. Ahmed Khan, fearing that the future enter prise of Mahomed Hussein Khan might disturb his arrangements, sent a corps of his Affghans to attack Mazenderan: but they were repulsed with considerable loss : and the fame and strength of the chief of the Kujurs were greatly increased by this victory. The province of Aderbijan was, at this period, under the rule of an Affghan leader-f. Ghilan had declared itself independent under one of its own chiefs J: and Georgia, governed by a Christian prince of the name of Heraclius, who had learned the art of war under Nddir, had assumed an attitude which induced many to believe that principality would emancipate itself from the degraded subjection in which it had been so long held by the Mahomedan princes of Asia. Such was the state of all the northern parts of the empire, when a chief of the tribe of Bukhtee^ree, called Aly Murd^n Khan, took possession of Isfahan ||, and determined to raise a pageant of the House of Suffee to the throne, in order that he might reconcile the inhabitants of that capital to his own usurpation of regal power. As he was well satisfied he could not effect this object without great aid, * Futteh Aly Khan, whose death and its cause have been noticed in the Life of Nadir Shah. f Az&amp;d Khan, who was one of the generals of Mdir Shah.

The principal of chap.xviii those was Kurreem Khan, of the tribe of Zund. This chief was ivurreem not of high birth*, and had obtained no command in the army Khan is inv;t - 0 ed to join the of N4dir : but he was distinguished for his good sense and cou- standard of 0 _ Aly Murd&amp;n rase. We are told by the historian of his reign, that Kurreem Khan. ° . v a.d. 1750. Khan from the first enjoyed an equal rank with Aly Murd^n: and a.h. 1164. that when it was agreed to raise a young prince-f of the race of Suffee to the throne, it was settled that one of the chiefs should be appointed his minister, and that the other should command the army. But it appears, from other authorities, that Kurreem did not consider himself on a level with Aly Murddn Khan. There is, indeed, ground to conclude, that his ambition was, at the com mencement of the connexion, limited to the prospect of succeeding that leader, who was very old and had no children. When the forces of these chiefs occupied Isfahan, that city was distracted by a number of parties. Every pretender to the throne had his adherents in the capital: but the inhabitants were soon reconciled to the new government. The troops of Aly Murddn Khan had at first committed some excesses, but no blood was shed: and that omrah, though stern and severe in his manner, was neither cruel nor unjust J. His fame, however, was soon eclipsed by that of Kurreem, who, when they took possession of Isfahan, defended the * In a genealogical account of his family, written by one of his immediate descend ants, Kurreem Khan is stated to have been the son of a celebrated freebooter of the name of Eym&amp;,ck: but there is no attempt to trace his descent further. + This pageant was the son of the sister of Shah Sultan Hussein: he was between eight and nine years old, and was crowned under the name of Shah Ismail.

He was rewarded with the warmest gratitude of those he saved from pillage. His soldiers even respected the principles of their leader; and the eyes of all were directed with admiration and astonishment to a chief of a barbarous tribe who refrained from plunder, and showed, amid scenes of violence and confusion, so marked a love of order and of justice. The conduct of Kurreem obtained him a popularity which ex cited the jealousy of Aly Murd^n Khan; and a short period brought Aiy Murd&amp;n these chiefs to an open rupture.

Before we proceed to a narration of the wars in which he was engaged, it will be useful to take a view of the character of those means and impressions to which he trusted for success, and to which he ultimately owed that com plete triumph with which his efforts were crowned. The inhabitants of Persia may be divided into four great classes, character of the population The first, and most powerful if united, are the native tribes of ofPersiaatthe . .j commence- that nation, who continue to live in tents*, and change their residence ment 0 f Kur- with the season.

The region that has been described includes Kerman, almost all Fars, a part of Irak, and the whole of Kurdistan. The inhabitants of these coun tries are divided into many different tribes ; but there cannot be a stronger proof of their coming from one stock, than that the languages which they speak are all rude dialects of the Pehlivi. There is a con siderable difference in these dialects, but not so much as to prevent the inhabitants of one province understanding that of another.

That country had either been governed by monarchs of a Tartar or an Arabian family. The numerous tribes of native Persians had, consequently, always been regarded with apprehension; and a jealous policy had sought, by transplanting them to distant quarters of the empire, and by fomenting internal divisions, to weaken their strength: but the great balance to their power were the Tartar, Turkish, or Turkoman tribes *, who had, at different periods, accompanied con querors from beyond the Oxus, from the banks of the Volga, and from the plains of Syria, into the kingdom of Persia. The usages of these tribes in all that related to their rude habitations, their mode of life, and of warfare, were the same as the others; but they had continued distinct, from the difference of their language; and that circumstance alone (had other motives been wanting) would have kept alive a spirit of rivalry and hatred in the minds of these two great classes of the military population of Persia. The Turkish tribes, though not so numerous as the Persians, were more powerful, because more united, and more wealthy. They had, through all the revolutions of that kingdom, been kept more concentrated, as they formed, from the period of the conquest of Toghrul Beg, till that of Abbas the Great, the force on which the different races of monarchs chiefly depended. The citizens and cultivators of Persia were not warlike; though the former had, on many occasions, by their gallant defence of their lives and property, acquired a high reputation for valour. There can hardly be said to be an} 7 distinction in these names, which are indis criminately used by Persian historians to describe those tribes in Persia who derive their origin from Tartary, or Turkistan, and who speak the Turkish language.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. m Almost all the towns and villages were walled; and in a country chap.xviii where the science of attack was but little known, the efforts of the inhabitants (part of whom were always a militia,) in repelling attack were often successful; and, consequently, though this part of the population seldom furnished many recruits to an army, their attachment was, in scenes of civil warfare, of great consequence to the chief whose cause they espoused. The fourth class of the inhabitants of Persia consisted of a number of tribes of Arabians, who entirely occupied the level coun try between the mountains and the shore of the Persian Gulf. This tract, which resembles, as has been before stated *, the peninsula of Arabia more than any of the interior provinces of Persia, had been long abandoned to this race, who had, from the most early ages, pos sessed a superiority over the Persians at sea.- The latter indeed seem, at all periods of their history, to have at once dreaded and abhorred that element. The Arabs- had consequently not only possessed them selves of the Islands of the Gulf, but of almost all the harbours along the coast. Their children had maintained these possessions, yielding at times a real, and at others a nominal, obedience to the government of Persia: but their poverty, the heat of the climate, and the barrenness of the soil of the countries they inhabited, combined with the facility with which those tribes who dwelt near the coast could embark in their boats, have at all periods aided the efforts made by this race to maintain themselves in a state of rude inde pendence. Such was the character of that population over which Kurreem Khan desired to establish his government. He was chief of a small * Vide Vol. I, page 2. vol. ii. r T122 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap.xviii tribe, who, though described as a branch of that of the Lac, claimed a jjjgij ran k among the native tribes of his country*.

The inhabitants of the principal cities of the empire showed, from the first, their partiality to Kurreem, which was grounded on the confidence they reposed in his humanity and justice. The Arabians, who had continued to preserve the habits of their nation, admired the simplicity and manliness of-his character; and even those enemies, against whom he had chiefly to contend, the Affghanf and Turkish tribes, who fought under the banners of his rivals for power, considered Kurreem Khan with respect, and placed an implicit reliance not only in his pledged faith, but on the generosity of his disposition, and the probity of his mind. Kurreem Khan had, after the death of Aly Murd^n Khan, two formidable rivals J, whom it was necessary that he should subdue before his power could be firmly established.

All who remained for any time in the pass were killed : but retreat was for a long time impossible, as those in the rear, when the action commenced, rushed forward to the support of their comrades. A few brave men, rendered desperate by their situation, made an attempt to reach their enemies, but they only hastened their own destruction.

Khan (who belonged to the latter) to be the general of Shah T^masp, gave him an influence and authority, which led to his being recognised as the head of the whole tribe. When he was murdered by Nddir Shah, that monarch, who desired to cherish divisions in this formidable tribe, gave the government of Asterabad to a noble of the higher family*; and the consequence was, that Mahomed Hussein Khan, the son of Futteh Aly, was compelled to save his life by taking refuge with the Turkoman tribes, who feed their flocks in the neighbourhood of that town. Aided by these robbers, and a few other adherents, he made, during the life of Nadir Shah, an attack on his native district, which was at first successful; but, being unable to maintain himself, this expedition terminated in the death or ruin of almost all those who were rash enough to attach themselves to his fortunes. He escaped again to 4he Turkomans, with whom he had established a connexion that seems always to have afforded him a safe retreat. We find in the page of Jonas Hanway a very particular and curious account of the capture of Asterabad by Mahomed Hussein Khan, and the subsequent dispersion and punishment of the fol lowers of the Kujur chief. Hanway was in Asterabad when it was taken; and when the valuable investment, of which he had the charge, was presented by Mahomed Hussein to the Turkomans, he heard, with horror, these barbarians demand, that ' the merchant, ' as well as all his goods, should be given to them. He would/' * The name of this chief was Zuman-beg. His father, Mdhomed Hussein Khan, was a great favourite of Mdir Shah.

He told them to be content with the plunder: and the man, thus saved from looking after flocks on the shores of the Caspian, not only obtained from the justice of Nddir Shah the restitution of almost all the property he had lost, but lived to become a most distinguished citizen of one of the first capitals in the universe. From the occurrence of this event, till the death of Nddir Shah, a period of nearly four years, Mahomed Hussein Khan remained with the Turkoman tribes*. The moment he heard that the conqueror was slain, he appears to have left his retreat; and we find him, a few months subsequent, in such force, that he defeated (as has been before stated,) a large body of Affghans of the army of Ahmed Shah, who attempted to penetrate into Mazenderan. Kurreem Kurreem Khan, after he had made himself master of Shiraz, took Khan subjects • i • i i - a Pars, and advantage of the contest in which his enemies, Azdd Khan and Ma- of/sfa^n 01 ^ homed Hussein Khan, were engaged with each other, not only to A.'H. 1170.' subject the whole of Fars to his authority, but to possess himself of the City of Isfahan, and a great part of the Province of Irakf. He was, however, soon compelled to abandon the greatest part of these territories; for Mahomed Hussein Khan, after defeating AzM Khan, and adding Aderbijan to his possessions, directed his march toward Isfahan, with an army far superior to any that had been assembled under one chief since the death of N^dir Shah. Kurreem Khan is compelled made an attempt to arrest the progress of this force, but in vain: to retreat to , n i . shiraz. he was compelled to retreat to Shiraz, where he shut himself up, determined to abide a siege. * Tuarikh Kujur. ' f Tuarikh Zundeaii.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 129 We are informed by an intelligent traveller*, that success com- chap.xviii pletely changed the character of Mahomed Hussein Khan. He had been remarkable for his mildness and moderation; but the near prospect of the crown made him haughty and rapacious. He particularly evinced this change in his altered conduct to the inha bitants of Isfahan, whom he no longer treated with that temper and justice which he had shown when he thought their attach ment was of consequence to his interests. He now levied large contributions upon the city, and allowed his troops to commit, unpunished, the most wanton excesses. These proceedings were not more calculated to diminish his reputation than to add to that of his rival, Kurreem, whose behaviour towards the citizens of the capital had, under all circumstances, been the same. Mahomed Hussein Khan, having completed his preparations, Mahomed •ii i -Tfi ii i'i Hussein Khan left eight thousand men in Isfahan, and advanced, with a force lays siege to amounting to nearly thirty thousand, to lay siege to Shiraz-f. The S ajd. irsr. defences of that city consisted only of a high mud wall flanked by ^ 1171 ' round towers, and surrounded by a deep dry ditch: but in Persia the science of attack is not more advanced than that of defence; and the slightest fortification seemed formidable to those whose force was chiefly cavalry, and whose unskilful gunners could only fire their unwieldy cannon a few rounds in the course of a day. Nevertheless, every thing concurred to give confidence to the besiegers. The attack commenced at a season when the country Commences round Shiraz is beautiful. The fields were covered with grain; and a the most abundant harvest seemed growing for the support of the * Olivier, Vol. VI. page 70. VOL. U.

Their batteries were hardly opened before they were attacked by successive sallies from the garrison : and while their attention was occupied in repelling these, a considerable body of horse, commanded by Shaikh Aly Khan, a brave and able leader of the tribe of Zund, His supplies commenced a predatory warfare upon their supplies, in which he ecTby'shaikh was aided by the inhabitants of the surrounding country, who burnt Aly Khan. and their families, and all the property they could carry, into the neighbouring mountains*. The effect of these measures was to produce a scarcity of provisions in the camp of Mahomed Hussein Khan, and to spread discontent among his soldiers. The delays and hardships of a protracted siege, which often weary the patience of well-appointed and dis ciplined bodies of men, are altogether insupportable to those loose, irregular, and unconnected masses which constitute the forcp of an Asiatic prince. In the present case, the evil became more dangerous from the composition of the besieging army, a great proportion of which was new levies; and some had, till the flight of Azikl Khan, been fighting for years against the chief under whose banners they now served. While the light troops of Kurreem were employed in haras sing the besiegers, that chief not only bravely defended the city, but employed every art to spread defection among his enemies. His efforts were completely successful: and the daily desertion of numerous bodies of his troops warned Mahomed Hussein Khan of * Tuarikh Zundeah,THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 131 the necessity of an early retreat*. He suddenly raised the siege, and chap.xviii marched to Isfahan: but the corps he had left at that capital dis- nersed the moment they heard of his failure. Under such circum- sie g e ' i J treats to Isfa- stances, he was compelled to retire to Mazenderan, which he ban. reached with a dispirited army, whose numbers had been reduced, by desertion, to twelve thousand men. Kurreem Khan, after recruiting his forces, and restoring tran quillity to the province of Ears, advanced to Isfahan, where he was received with the most sincere joy. The inhabitants welcomed him as the ruler they loved: and their example was followed by all the principal cities in Irak. Kurreem took care, by his conduct, to preserve a feeling to which he was already so deeply indebted. His military career, since he had become a competitor for the sovereign power, had not been fortunate. He had gained but few victories, and was often defeated. His condition had more than once seemed desperate: but still the preference which the citizens of Persia gave to this prince over his rivals, had the constant effect of enabling him to support reverses, and to take full advantage of every casual success. He could not but be proud of an attachment to which he had no claims but what originated in his personal good qualities: and the strength it gave him must have been a motive for his persevering in that course of moderation and justice by which it had been obtained. While Kurreem was employed in settling the numerous provinces which now cheerfully submitted to his authority, he detached Shaikh Aly Khan into Mazenderan, and placed under the command of that Tuarikh Zunde^h.132 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap.xviii general the choice troops of his army, in order that he might com- pletely subdue Mahomed Hussein Khan: but it is not probable that object would have been effected if the tribe of Kujurs had remained united.

Several of his relations and adherents were, in consequence of this treachery, put to death: a rash act of resentment, which revived, with increased violence, the feud that had so long distracted this tribe.

The vigour with which he acted, when compelled to punish them, increased the respect of this class of his subjects. The most refractory and troublesome of all these petty rulers was Meer Mohunna, of Bunder Reeg, a small ^accountof seaport, half a degree to the north-west of Abusheher. This chief Meer Mohun- was at once remarkable for his valour and his atrocious wickedness. He had offended the Persian government almost beyond the hope of pardon; having been led, by the desire of plunder, to interrupt, by his depredations, the communication between Shiraz and Abusheher, which had now become the principal port* of the kingdom. When attacked by a numerous army, he defended his possessions on the continent for several months; and w T hen forced to abandon them, he took refuge in the small Island of Corgo, which is situated near the top of the Gulf, at the distance of nearly a degree from Bunder Reeg. On this spot, which does not contain more than two square miles, and has hardly any cultivation, the desperate Arab not only supported a number of his followers, and defeated all the efforts of the Shaikh of Abusheher to subdue him, but added to his means by plundering a number of vessels, and succeeded in surprising the Dutch garrison of the neighbouring Island of Kharruck. These successes, from giving more scope to his dreadful * Gombroon was, about this period, almost deserted.136 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. ciiap.xviii cruelties, only accelerated his ruin. All around him were enemies: but he might, for some time, have braved external danger, if he could have preserved the fidelity of his own tribe. A rebellion of his followers obliged him to fly to Bussorah, where he was immediately seized, and slain. The governor of that city not only refused his claims to protection*, but, to mark the detes tation in which he held his character, directed that his corpse should be cast out into a field to be devoured by dogs. The account of the death of Meer Mohunnd spread joy from the Court of Shiraz to the shores of India.

The Persian historian* who describes a. d. 1763. 1 . . a. h. 1178. the expedition to D&lt;iingh «l ,n, is careful to inform us, that it was upon this occasion that the inventive barbarity of Zuckee Khan first made a garden of his enemies. He directed the earth to be opened at equal distances, as if for the reception of trees, to form an avenue. Large branches were then cut, and a prisoner tied to each, with his head towards the root, which being placed where the ground was opened, the soil, as it was thrown in, produced a gradual suffocation.. It is horrible even to think on such scenes; but still the relation is important, were it only to make the mind sensible, by extreme contrast, to the blessings of civilization. The terror which the cruelty of Zuckee Khan inspired, was no doubt useful in preserving the general tranquillity of the kingdom. The known lenity of the ruling prince had encouraged numbers to rebel, with an expectation that, even if unsuccessful, pardon would follow submission. All knew that these hopes were vain when his savage brother was employed. He had succeeded not only in re pressing rebellion at D^mghdn, but in Mazenderanf, and several other parts of the empire; and every where his track was marked by blood. The very rumour of his approach was at last sufficient to spread dismay; and those who most execrate his memory confess, sovereign of Persia. In the Tuarikh ZundeSii it is stated, that he was murdered at the instigation of Hussein Khan Youkh&amp;,ree-b^8h, the Kujur chief of a rival family, who has been before mentioned, and who was, at this period, Governor of Asterabad. * Meerza Saduck. t The Kujurs of the Youkharee-bash had rebelled, and several of their chiefs were taken, and put to death.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. that he greatly contributed to that general peace and security which chap. Persia enjoyed during the latter years of Kurreem Khan. The troops which civilized nations maintain for their defence, are raised I indiscriminately from the mass of the population, and the power to support them increases with those resources which are greatest at periods of the most profound tranquillity. The case is very different with barbarous states, whose armies are formed of a class of men quite distinct from the resi of the community. These receive no regular pay; and, consequently, have their means of subsistence narrowed or extended with the sphere of their action. Such a body, if at all numerous, cannot be supported but in war, where they live upon the enemy; yet it is hazardous to disband men who have no pursuits of industry, and who have hardly any resource, when at peace with foreign powers, but in internal troubles. If (which rarely happens) the wealth of a rude government enables it to pay an army, it cannot allow that to remain idle without the certainty of its soon becoming useless; for, in bodies of men so constituted, efficiency must be the result of that individual energy and experience which actual employment can alone give; and the place of which is, in regular armies, in a great degree supplied by the influence of order, and the impulse of discipline. It is upon this general reasoning that we must account for those constant wars in which we find some of the best Asiatic monarchs engaged; and it is probable, that these considerations influenced the conduct of Kurreem Khan in the attack which he made, a few years before his death, upon the Turkish territories. That prince had continued to display as much moderation in the exercise of his power, as sovereign of Persia, as he had in the progress140 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. cmap.xviii to its attainment. Though he deemed it prudent to confine the pageant* to whom Aly Murddn Khan-f had given the name of king; and to refrain from the mockery of a false allegiance, he only styled himself Vakeel, or lieutenant of the kingdom, and seemed to act under no desire of personal aggrandisement. De voted to Shiraz, which he had made his capital, he had ceased to lead his armies in person : and he even committed the large force which he assembled for the siege of Bussorah to the command of his brother, Sdduck Khan; though he must have been sen sible that the ties of blood only rendered it more probable so great a trust would be abused. From every consideration, therefore, of his disposition, and the actual state of Persia at the moment, we must conclude his principal motive for the attack of the Turkish territory was to preserve the internal tranquillity of Persia, by em ploying those by whom it was most likely to be disturbed in foreign war: and having taken that resolution, he studied to devise pre texts that would render this measure popular with his subjects. To men professing the tenets of the Sheah sect there could be no greater encouragement offered than the prospect of becoming the conquerors of that land which contained the tombs of the holy Aly, and of his sainted sons, Hussein and Hussun; and the most pro minent ground J on which Kurreem attempted to justify the war in Kurreern Khan's mo tives for at tacking the Turkish ter ritory. * He removed him from Isfahan to a fort called Aub^d^h, on the road between that city and Shiraz. f Vide page 116. % There were several other pretexts. He accused Omar of having, by the aid he had granted, to the Imaum of Muscat, prevented the Persians from subduing the province of Oman. He was also said to have plundered some Persian merchants.— Tuarikh Zundeah.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 141 which he engaged, was allied to this feeling*. He demanded from ciiap.xviii the Court of Constantinople the head of Omar, the P4ch4 of Bagdad, for having levied a tax upon the Persian pilgrims who visited those sacred tombs.

The city which he had to reduce was of great extent, as Bussorah. it contained a number of large gardens, as well as houses, within its walls. The inhabitants were reckoned at forty thousand, and the troops who formed the garrison were more than one fourth of that number. The governor, Solimdn Aga, was a brave soldier, and his character gave him every right to expect the attachment of those under his orders. The walls were high, but not strong; and the chief defence consisted of a number of bastions, on which nearly a hundred pieces of cannon were mounted. Though the siege proceeded slowly, still the Persian army made progress; and the weak Court of Constantinople, alarmed at the prospect of losing a possession of such importance, ordered a number of the neighbouring pachas* to march, with all the troops they could collect, to Bagdad. It was at first thought that these were meant to combine with the ruler of that province for the relief of Bussorah; but it soon appeared that they were only instructed to put Omar to death, in the hope that his punishment might satisfy the King of Persia, and cause him to desist from his enterprise f.

From the period of the invasion of Persia till the latter years of the reign of Kurreem Khan, European nations had maintained but little intercourse with Persia, as the distracted state of that empire was most unfavourable for commerce. The English had removed Removal of . the English their factory from Gombroon in consequence of the oppressive factory from Gombroon. * The name of this chief was Aly Mahomed Khan. f He was particularly attentive to the English.

The local position of this island was peculiarly favourable to commerce; and it possessed great advantages, in the abundance and excellence of its fresh water, and the salubrity of its climate. Under circumstances so propitious to its prosperity, it is not surprising that Kharruck should have soon become a flourishing settlement.

It was neglected and lost, as has been described, because it was not worth preserving to the nation* by whom it had been acquired.

This body of Christians were the first that benefited from his justice : and to the last moment of his life he was anxious for their prosperity. The possessors and culti vators of the soil in Persia have to pay but a very moderate propor tion of its produce to the government: but, as the monarch can impose arbitrary fines and requisitions, he may be said to possess the power of taxation at pleasure. The condition of this class, therefore, is almost as dependent for their happiness on his personal disposition, as any other in the community. They enjoyed under Kurreem as much consideration as he was able to give them; and he was, on all occasions, ready to redress the wrongs they suffered from the oppressions of the officers placed over them : but still, from the opposite view which travellers who visited Persia during his reign have taken of the actual condition of his subjects, we must conclude, that the state of the countries which were near the seat of rule, and consequently under his immediate observation, was very different from that of provinces, which, from their remoteness to the * This account of the Dutch establishment at Kharruck is taken from cotemporary travellers, and from the public records of that transaction.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 147 capital, or the turbulence of their inhabitants, were given over to chap.xviii the arbitrary rule of military chiefs.

Kurreem, perhaps, was first induced to make this city his capital, by the circumstance of its being centrical to the pasture lands of those tribes on whose support he chiefly de pended, and from the attachment which its inhabitants early showed to his interests. He was at great pains to strengthen its defences ; and he improved and ornamented the city itself with a number of useful and magnificent buildings, and beautified its environs by the erection of some fine edifices, near which were planted luxuriant gardens: but he appeared still more desirous of promoting the comfort and prosperity of the inhabitants of Shiraz, than of increasing the magnitude, or adding to the splendour, of that capital. ' The rays of this sun of majesty,' observes a Persian histo rian*, speaking of Kurreem Khan, ' were spread over the whole ' empire; but the influence of its genial heat was most felt at ' Shiraz. The inhabitants of that favoured city enjoyed the most ' perfect tranquillity and happiness. In the society of moon-faced &lt;4 damsels they passed their leisure hours; the sparkling goblet ' circulated; and love and pleasure reigned in every breast.'

It is probable that Kurreem only knew his own age by a refer-THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. twenty-six years ; and during the last twenty he had been, with out a competitor, the acknowledged ruler of the kingdom of Persia. The character of this prince is not easily described. It has few of the common features of a despotic monarch. He had ambition; but it was free from the turbulence which almost always mixes with that passion. He preserved, equally amid scenes of violence and of repose, an undisturbed temper; and was, through life, distinguished by a manly simplicity of mind, which kept him as remote from the pomp and vanities of his high rank, as from that affectation which endeavours to conceal its pride under the garb of humility. This prince, though humane, sometimes punished severely: and he employed others of a disposition very different to his own to spread terror among his enemies and rebellious subjects: but his clemency was hardly ever refused to a fallen or a repentant foe. One of the most remarkable features of his character was goodness of heart. He very often repeated an anecdote of his early life, which showed a feeling very uncommon among those of his condition. ' When ' I was a poor soldier,' said Kurreem, ' in Nddir Shah's camp, ' my necessity led me to steal, from a saddler, a gold embossed ' saddle, which had been sent by an Affghan chief to be repaired. 44 I soon afterwards learnt that the man, from whose shop it ' was taken, was in prison, and sentenced to be hung. My con- ence to events that occurred about the period of his birth. There is no register of births kept in a wandering tribe: and it is not probable that either this prince, or any of his family, possessed an exact record on such a subject. I one day asked a Persian of a wandering tribe his age. The answer was, Moollah na hustum he hissdb sal he danum: that is, ' I am not a learned man, that I should understand to calculate my ' years.'THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 149 ' science smote me, and I replaced the saddle exactly on the place chap.xviii ' from whence I took it. I watched till it was discovered by the ' saddler's wife, who, on seeing it, gave a scream of joy, fell down ' upon her knees, and prayed aloud that the person who had brought ' it back might live to have a hundred gold embossed saddles. ' I am quite certain/' Kurreem used to add, smiling, ' that the ,6 honest prayer of the old woman has aided my fortune in the attain- ' ment of that splendour which she desired I should enjoy Kurreem Khan was possessed of that noble courage which dares to pardon ; and the generous confidence with which he treated those whom he forgave, appears to have almost always attached them to his person. The virtues of this prince had nothing of a romantic character: they were, like all his other qualities, plain and intrinsic. He was reputed pious, and was exact in the performance of his religious duties; but his religion was not austere. His natural disposition was, indeed, gay and cheerful; and he continued to the last to enjoy the pleasures of this world, and anxiously desired that others should do the same. This inclination has given rise to one of the few attacks-f that have been made upon the reputa tion of this prince: but, if we are to believe the concurring testi mony of historians, and of living witnesses, we must pronounce that his example, even in the path of dissipation, could not have been very baneful; for his love of pleasure never degenerated into intem- * Persian MS. Major Campbell's Journal. t The Russian traveller, Gmellin, who visited, during Kurreem Khan's reign, some of the provinces near the Caspian which had been recently subdued, and were with difficulty kept in subjection, reports him (conformable to the local impression he received,) as a prince immersed in luxury, and heedless of the miseries of his subjects.150 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap.xviii perance; nor was he ever unfitted by indulgence for the active performance of his duties as a sovereign. Kurreem Khan had received no education. It is stated that he could not even write: and from his birth, and the occupations of his early years, it is probable he neither had, nor desired to have, any such accomplishment. The son of a petty chief of a barba rous tribe* would be brought up to despise all attainments, except such as were suited to his condition of life. In these he excelled. Possessed of great bodily strength, and an active frame, he was an admirable horseman, and expert in all his military exercises : but, though unlearned himself, he valued and encouraged learn ing in others. His court was the resort of men of liberal know ledge. He built tombs over the remains of Sadi and Hafiz, which are deposited near Shiraz, and endowed these edifices with gardens and lands for the support of the dervishes, or holy men, appointed to watch over them. This pious act, while it marked his regard for superior genius, was one of the most popular of his reign with the inhabitants of a city, whose chief boast is that of being the birth place of those whose memory he so greatly honoured. It is the usage of the King of Persia to devote a number of hours each day to hear the complaints of his subjects. An anecdote is related of Kurreem Khan, which, while it shows the confidence that was reposed in his temper and justice, admirably illustrates the consideration and feeling with which he performed this important part of his duty. He was one day on the point of retiring from his judgment-seat, harassed and fatigued with a long attendance, when # The Zuntl, and all other branches of the Lac, are certainly as barbarous as any of the wandering tribes of Persia.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 151 a man rushed forward in apparent distraction, calling out in a loud chap.xviii voice for justice. ' Who are you?' said Kurreem. I am a « merchant/' replied the man, ' and have been robbed and plun- ' dered by some thieves of all I possess.'—' What were you about, said the prince, ' when you were robbed?'—' I was asleep,' an swered the man.—' And why did you sleep?' exclaimed Kurreem in a peevish and impatient tone.— 44 Because,' said the undaunted Persian, ' I made a mistake, and thought you were awake ' The irritation of the royal judge vanished in a moment: he was too much pleased with the manly boldness of the petitioner to be offended at the reproach his words conveyed. Turning to his vizier, he bade him pay the amount of the merchant's losses from the treasury. ' We must,' he added, ' try to recover the property from 44 the robbers*.' The mode which Kurreem Khan took to attain and to preserve his power, was different from that pursued by any former monarch of Persia. He made no effort to gain strength by the aid of religious or superstitious feelings. He neither tried to attach his army by gratifying their lust of plunder ; nor courted the applause of a vain glorious nation by the pursuit of ambitious projects, or the gorgeous display of royal splendour. He was modest, even to his attire; and though his rule was always firm, and at times harsh, his general manner to the meanest of his subjects was familiar and kind. There is no part of the character of this prince with which we are more * This anecdote of Kurreem Khan is taken from a small Persian MS., and I have heard it from several Persians.

He lived happily; and his death was that of a father, amid a family whom he had cherished, and by whom he was beloved. The inhabitants of Persia to this day venerate his name; and those who have risen to greatness on the destruction of the dynasty which he founded, do not withhold their tribute of applause to his goodness. These, indeed, when meaning to detract from his fame, often give him the highest possible eulogium. ' Kurreem Khan*/' they say, &lt;e was not a great king. His court ' was not splendid; and he made few conquests: but it must be ' confessed,^ they add, ' that he was a wonderful magistrate # I have repeatedly heard this observation made by the first among those Kujur chiefs who have risen to great power upon the downfall of the family of Kurreem f Kutkhodah.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 153 CHAPTER XIX.

This prince had, for some time after he surrendered himself, been very strictly guarded, and was never allowed to go beyond the walls of the town; but latterly he was permitted to take the amusement of the chase. This indulgence was not more owing to the kind ness of Kurreem Khan's character, than to the settled state of his government; which no chief of a tribe, however powerful, could hope to disturb. The extraordinary wisdom of Aga Mahomed had attracted the notice of that ruler, who was, we are told, in the frequent habit of asking his advice on questions of state policy *. Aga Mahomed, therefore, had the fullest opportunity of appreciating the characters of the princes and nobles of the Persian court; and we can believe that he had long looked to the death of Kurreem Khan as the crisis of his own fate. When the last illness of that prince assumed a dangerous appearance, he contrived to leave the city -f- on the usual pretext of hunting. His sister, who was in the royal haram, sent him intelligence from hour to hour of the progress of Kurreem's disorder.

He had probably only waited for a favourable opportunity of revolting from a ruler in whom he could never repose confidence, and who was hated and dreaded by all his subjects. An appeal which S^duck Khan, after his flight from Shiraz, made to Aly Moorad, who was then at Teheran, gave him the pretext that he desired. He assembled the officers of his army, and demanded from them if it was not disgraceful to support any longer a chief, who treated the son and brother of Kurreem Khan in the manner Zuckee Khan had done.

All ranks appeared to rejoice at Aly Moorad's success; and he obtained additional popularity by proclaiming, that he had no design beyond that of restoring the eldest son of the virtuous Kurreem Khan to the throne, which was his lawful inheritance. Zuckee Khan, we are told-f, became quite furious when he heard Zuckee Khan assembles all of the revolt of his nephew. He immediately assembled all the the troops and force he could, and marched toward Isfahan: but the hour was gainst hinu near when this tyrant was to fill up the measure of his guilt, and to fall by the hands of those very men whom he had trained to crime. When he arrived at Yezdikhaust he demanded from a.d. im. , 1 A.

The man protested his innocence, and was doomed, after being stabbed, to be thrown over the same precipice as the others. Peculiarly enraged at what he deemed the obstinacy of his last victim, he directed that his wife and daughter should be given over to the brutal lust of some of his guards, who were of the tribe of MaafFee*: but these men, savage as they were, shuddered at the conduct of their chief, and particu larly his last act, which they deemed at once horrid and sacrilegious. While these feelings prevailed, a conspiracy was formed; and those who had long been the instruments of his guilt, established a claim Murder of upon the gratitude of their country by the murder of their inhuman Zuckee Khan, leader. The Town of Yezdikhaust, where this event took place, is situated upon the high and rocky bank of a narrow and deep vale, which in this quarter divides the provinces of Irak and Tars. Its remarkable site and rude fortifications give it a very singular and romantic appearance; and it is now interesting from being considered as a scene which has been hallowed by the sword of retributive justice. The memory of Zuckee Khan is held in execration; and the traveller, who is passing Yezdikhaust, is stopt to hear the catalogue of his crimes: he is shewn the window from whence he directed the principal inhabitants^ and tjie holy Syud, to be thrown; and the feelings which this spectacle, and * The Maaffee are, like the Zund, a branch of the Lac; one of the most numerous of the native tribes of Persia.

The character of Abool Futteh Khan, who was proclaimed King a. d. 1779. a. n. 1193. of Persia the instant Zuckee Khan was put to death, would not lead Abooi Futteh to a conclusion that he was at all concerned in the bold act* of claimed 8 kbg. justice which placed in his hands a power that he appears to have been unfit to exercisef. His elevation, however, was evidently the only measure which could save the Zund family from that destruc tion to which it seemed doomed ; and for a moment all indulged in the delusive expectation of a long period of tranquillity. Sdduck Khan, the moment he heard of Zuckee Khan's death, s^duck Khan hastened from Kerman to Shirazf.

Among the chiefs of his army, there was none who, during the siege, had distinguished himself more for his courage and conduct than Ackbar Khan, the son of Zuckee Khan; but we may conclude that chief was as cruel and revengeful as he was brave and enterprising, from a knowledge that he not only urged Aly Moorad to put Sdduck Khan, with his three younger sons, and some of his principal nobles, to death, but obtained permission to be their executioner. His eagerness for their fate precipitated his own : he was accused of having plotted against the life of the ruler he served; and it could not have been difficult to persuade Aly Moorad of the dangers he had to apprehend from his ambitious cousin. He believed, or affected to believe, that he was guilty j and the prince, Jaaffer Khan, became the willing instrument of putting to death* the man whose hands were yet stained with the blood of his father and of his brothers, former, who yisited Shiraz in 1786, when Jaaffer Khan, the son of that prince, was upon the throne, could be mistaken in such a fact. Yet Aly Reza, in his History of the Zund Family, distinctly states, that the eyes of this prince and his brothers were put out by Aly Moorad Khan, when he took Shiraz. But this is probably an attempt of a partial historian to remove the guilt of this act from a prince for whose memory he cherished respect. * franklin and Oliyier states, that he conspired against the Jife of Aly MooradTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 167 After remaining a few months at Shiraz, Aly Moorad Khan chap. xix. returned to Isfahan, which city became, during his reign, the capital of the kingdom.

Aly Rez&amp;, in his History of the family, informs us, that there was a mixture of both motives; that Ackbar Khan had, no doubt, ambitious views; and that Aly Moorad Khan dreaded him so much, as to be glad of a pretext for putting him to death: this is probably the fact. # He was first appointed to Shuster, and afterwards to the Khurasa. f Mahomed Zahir Khan.168 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xix. the other conquests which he had made.

His ministers and medical attendants entreated him to remain where he was, till the violence of his disease had abated; and the latter gave it as their opinion, that the fatigue of travelling at that severe season of the year (for it was the depth of winter,) would be attended with extreme hazard to his life: but the impatient monarch refused to listen to their advice; his mind could think of no danger but that a h 1199 which threatened his power.

The character of Aly Moorad Khan has been variously given. And character He appears to have possessed an energetic and firm mind. There can be no better claim to character than the respect of an able enemy. Aga Mahomed Khan, who found it difficult, while this prince lived, to maintain Mazenderan, was wont to say to those of his adherents who urged him to advance into Irak, ' Let us wait till ' that respectable blind gentleman* (so he always called Aly Moorad, who had lost one of his eyes,) is out of the way, and then, but not ' before, we may succeed in such an enterprise/ , A period of five days elapsed from the death of Aly Moorad till the arrival of Jaaffer Khan at Isfahan; during which short period the name and ensigns of royalty were usurped by Banker Khan, the BaukerKhan governor of that city; a vain, imprudent man, who appears to have Tame of king, had no means whatever of supporting his pretensions. He fled at Jaaffer Khan's approach, but was pursued and taken, and his is taken and ambition only obtained him the distinction of sharing the impri- j^feKham sonment of the relations of his late sovereign.

Rendered desperate by his situation, the chief of Kazeroon entered into a conspiracy with some other pri soners to destroy the despot by whom he had been so cruelly treated.

The Arab chief, who had granted him protection and aid, died immediately after his arrival at Abusheher; but with his last breath he charged his son ^ to devote himself to Lootf Aly Khan; whose small army, when he first took the field, was almost entirely formed of the followers of this petty ruler.

Syud Moorad Khan, who had shut himself up in the citadel, was soon compelled to surrender, and suffered death: but Hajee Aly Kooli, whose defec tion from that cause, which resentment and despair had led him to adopt, was essential to the success of this revolution, had, with several others, received the most solemn assurances of pardon from Hajee Ibrahim ; and Lootf Aly Khan, on his accession to the throne, not only confirmed these promises, but marked with favour and con fidence those to whom they were made. Before we proceed further with the history of Lootf Aly Khan, it appears necessary to say a few words of the origin and rise of a man, whose name became, about this period, so conspicuous in the annals of his country. Hajee Ibrahim was the son of Hajee HdshemJ, a respectable magistrate of Shiraz, who having lost his eye-sight * Shah Moorad. -j- His name was Aly Himmut Khan. J The name of Hajee Hashem is still held in great respect in his native city. When the great conqueror, JNSxlir Shah, encamped there, this magistrate gave him an entertainment in the garden of Dil Gooshd, near the tomb of Sadi. This event, which flattered the vanity of the family, as it proved the consequence of Hajee H&amp;shem, is lelat^d in the History of Hajee Ibrahim : and the son of that minister, Meerza Maho med Khan, gave me an entertainment in 1800, on the same spot where (he took care to inform me) his grandfather had feasted Nliidir Shah and his court about seventy years before.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 177 through age, was, during his latter years, unfit for business, and chap. xix. left a large family in very low, if not distressed circumstances : but his son, Hajee Ibrahim, early succeeded to the office of magis trate to one of the wards of his native city : and his manly character, in which good temper and good sense were combined with the most extraordinary fortitude, raised him rapidly into high employ ment. He had been placed in the situation his father held by Kur- reem Khan, and promoted to higher charge * by Aly Moorad ; and, as it was chiefly owing to his exertions that JaafFer Khan obtained such easy possession of Shiraz when forced to fly from Isfahan, he had (as has been before stated,) raised Hajee Ibrahim to the high station of kalanter, or first magistrate of the province of Fars : and the influence which that situation gave, enabled him to repay his debt of gratitude to the father, by placing his son upon the throne. No event could appear more propitious to the happiness of his character of country, or more likely to restore the fallen fortunes of the family to Khan. AIy which he belonged, than the elevation of Lootf Aly Khan. Though ^ h. llol'. this prince was not yet twenty years of age, he had been matured by continual employment during his father's reign, and he was already ranked, both in the estimation of his friends and enemies, among the bravest and the best soldiers of his country. His appearance was singularly calculated to win that admiration which his qualities com manded : his countenance was beautiful, and full of animated expres sion : his form tall and graceful; and, though slender, he was active and strong. In skill as a horseman, and in dexterity at all martial * He was made magistrate of all the Hyderee m&amp;Mls, or wards termed Hyderee, which included more than half the city. vol. ii. 2 a178 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. •chap . xix. exercises, he was unrivalled: nor was he deemed wanting in those mental qualities which his situation required. He had displayed, on several occasions, as much conduct as courage: and before he ascended the throne, his manners were kind and prepossessing, par ticularly to his inferiors : but, soon after he obtained power, his dis position changed, and his mind appears to have lost some of its best qualities. He was no longer mild and conciliating, but proud and self-sufficient. The gratitude and esteem which he expressed, and probably felt at the moment, for Hajee Ibrahim, whose attachment to his cause had enabled him to attain the throne, gave way to feelings of alarm and suspicion. Nor was it, perhaps, surprising that he should have viewed with more jealousy than regard the subject who had shown himself possessed of the dangerous power of placing the crown upon his head. Lootf Aiy Lootf Aly Khan was hardly established in the government, before Khan is de- feated by Aga Aga Mahomed Khan advanced to attack him.

The Kujur prince, encouraged by this success, immediately invested that city : but, after a vain endeavour (continued for more than a month) to make some impression upon its defences, he raised the siege, and returned to Teheran, which had now become the capital of his kingdom. a.d. 1790.

The season of operations was almost past; Khan marches into Kerman. and all the prudent counsellors of Lootf Alj Khan urged him to accept the terms offered by the chief of Kerman, which included the full acknowledgment of his authority, the regular payment of the revenue of the province, and every submission that could be required of him, except his personal attendance at court. But on this the im petuous prince insisted; and, with a view of enforcing it, he laid siege, Lays siege to _ &lt; that city. during a very severe winter, to the City of Kerman.

Before he proceeded on this unfortunate expedition, he had ap pointed one of his younger brothers, who was quite a child, to the nominal rule of Ears: but he had, at the same time, committed the civil government of Shiraz, and the countries in its vicinity, to Hajee Ibrahim. The command of the garrison of that city, with separate powers, was given to a chief of his own tribe, called Burkhooddr Khan; and the ark, or citadel, was placed in charge of another noble man of the Zund family. This division of authority, which was # The name of this chief was Hussein Khan Khakee. t Aly Reza's History of the Zund Family.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. xix. meant to guard against the effects of treachery, tended only to promote it. Burkhooddr Khan, who was a weak and arrogant man, vain of his rank and of his independent power over the military, in sisted, but without effect, upon Hajee Ibrahim paying him all those submissive attentions, which in Persia are considered as due to a superior. Offended at what he deemed a personal insult, he laboured to impress his prince with the belief, that so marked a proof of dis respect to a lord of the Zund family, could only have been shown by a man who cherished traitorous designs. If these representations were not altogether believed, they still made a serious impression on the irritated mind of Lootf Aly; and every act, after he returned from Kerman, proved that he had no longer that respect or confidence which he before entertained for his minister. An event had occurred some time before this period, which had greatly weakened that reliance which Hajee Ibrahim was at first dis posed to place on the character of his sovereign. It has been already stated, that Lootf Aly Khan had, at the earnest solicitation of that minister, pardoned a number of persons supposed to be concerned in the conspiracy against his father's life. Among these was a man called Meerza Mehdy, who had been formerly employed by Jaaffer Khan*; but, on being discovered in some peculation, was disgraced by that monarch, and condemned to lose his ears. When the head of Jaaffer Khan was thrown from the citadel, it had been exposed to a thousand indignities; and, according to popular rumour, Meerza Mehdy had revenged himself by cutting off the ears. The man had always denied the truth of this accu- * He was Lashkur-novees; the duties of which are, to keep a register of the troops, and to transact all business relative to the pay of the army.'djl THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 181 sation; and Hajee Ibrahim, who professed to be fully persuaded chap. xix. of his innocence, solicited his pardon of Lootf Aly Khan; who not only granted it, but said, if the accusation had been true, he freely forgave the meerza from the consideration that he had for his media tor. Several months subsequent, when the prince was distributing honorary dresses, one was given to Meerza Mehdy. This circum stance was reported to the mother of Lootf Aly Khan, who sent for him, and asked, if it was not enough that he should be required to forgive the murderers of his father. ' Is it necessary,^ she added, ' that you should degrade yourself by bestowing marks of re- 44 gard and favour upon a wretch who mutilated his remains* This upbraiding language had all the effect intended upon the violent temper of the prince. He returned to his court, summoned Meerza Mehdy, and, after reproaching him with his crime-f, directed him to be thrown into a fire. Hajee Ibrahim had been sent for, but arrived only in time to hear from the prince what he had done, and to se.e, with inward horror, the remains of the man whose pardon had been so fully granted to his intercession J. The mutual distrust which had arisen between the sovereign and the minister became apparent to all. The proud spirit of Lootf Aly * Persian MS. t Lootf Aly Khan, we are informed, demanded of Meerza Mehdy, what that man deserved who could behave ill to his sovereign and benefactor. ' To be burnt alive,' was the reply. ' You are the person,' said the prince; and directed him to be instantly thrown into a fire. — Persian MS. J Hajee Ibrahim related to me the particulars of this event, in almost the same words I find them written in his history. He assured me, he did not believe the man guilty of what popular rumour accused him ; and added, ' From the moment this act ' was committed, I lost all confidence in Lootf Aly Khan.'182 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA.

Khan could ill brook the restraint under which he evidently acted: but he could not venture on an open attack of one whose influence he still dreaded; for, independent of the devoted attachment which the citizens of Shiraz were known to entertain for Hajee Ibrahim, many of the governors of provinces and the chiefs of tribes were warmly attached to his interest, and his brothers commanded the principal corps of infantry with the army. But though the prince refrained from violence, every action showed his feelings; and the minister, satisfied that his existence was at stake, determined to subvert the authority of a ruler, ' from whom he had ceased,' to use his own words, ' to expect any thing but death When affairs were in this situation, Lootf Aly Khan, who had resolved upon advancing to Isfahan, made the same arrangements for a division of authority at Shiraz, as he had done when he pro ceeded to Kerman : and with a chief of his own family-f* in charge of the garrison, and another in command of the citadel, he considered that he had nothing to fear from his minister; but still he could not avoid showing a distrust of his fidelity. After he had publicly nomi nated him to the charge of the civil government, when the army was on the eve of marching he sent an order to direct that his eldest son, Meerza Mahomed, should be sent to camp; where the youth, who was loo young to be employed, was evidently meant to remain as a hostage for his father's conduct. If Plajee Ibrahim had before enter tained doubts regarding the light in which he was viewed, they were removed by this ill-timed act of impolitic suspicion : and he appears * MS.

TTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 183 to have decided upon the immediate execution of a plan, which he chap . xix. had for some time contemplated, of seizing upon Shiraz, and, by making over that city to Aga Mahomed Khan, rendering that monarch sole ruler of Persia. Hajee Ibrahim had, perhaps, persuaded himself*, that by this act of treason he was only anticipating an event which must occur, and saving his country from the misery of a protracted war between two rival families: but there can be no doubt his real motive was that of self-preservation. He had lost all confidence in Lootf Aly Khan. He knew that he had many enemies, who were incessant in their endeavours to destroy him ; and he perceived, from the conduct of the prince, that their representations had made all the impression which they could desire. Under these circumstances, he sought to preserve his life, and to place himself, by an act of signal service, under the protection of a powerful monarch. He was successful in attaining his object: but his memory is stained with the re proach of having destroyed a family to whom he owed all his advancement.

The unsubdued spirit which he had evinced gained him many followers; and his friends began to indulge the most sanguine hopes of the re-establishment of his power. But the daring valour and unwearied efforts of the young prince were opposed by a man, whose wisdom removed danger by measures of anticipation, and whose firmness, tempered by moderation, gave no unnecessary irritation to his enemies, while it secured the constancy and attachment of his adherents. The extraordinary character of this wonderful man was, perhaps, more fully displayed by his conduct on this critical occasion, than by any other action of his eventful life. After the revolt of his troops had forced Lootf Aly Khan to fly from that army with which he had hoped to conquer Isfahan in the preceding year, they had returned in a very disorderly a. d. 1792. manner to Shiraz; and their arrival had increased the number A ' 1206 of men of the military tribes* of Fars which were within its walls to about twelve thousand. The infantry, or city militia, which was composed of the shopkeepers and artificers, did not amount to a fifth part of this number, and yet these were the only troops from whom Hajee Ibrahim could expect support; for it was impossible that tribes, whose fortunes were dependent upon the continuance of the Zund dynasty, could ever give their con sent to what he intended, — the transfer of the power en : oyed by that family to the chief of the Kujurs, Satisfied that they would Hajee Ibrahim, oppose the execution of his plan, Hajee Ibrahim resolved upon dis- dSyfromthe arming, and expelling from Shiraz, this multitude of soldiers. He Clty ' * These are termed Eelliats, or ' tribes:' they are all soldiers, and generally horse men.

Having given orders to secure the streets which communicated by a back road from the place of his residence to the gateway of the city, he sent notice to the military tribes to be ready, at an appointed time, to receive a donation which he meant to give them. They assembled as directed, and one hun dred* were admitted at a time into the interior court of his mansion. From the height of the walls which surrounded it, those who were without could know nothing of what was passing within. The first party admitted found themselves surrounded, but were told no injury was intended to them if they resigned their arms; which they did : and while these were given to citizens, to increase the corps upon whom Hajee Ibrahim could depend, the unarmed soldiers were conducted, by the back road before mentioned, beyond the gates of the town. The whole were disarmed, and party after party joined their astonished companions under the walls. However ex traordinary it may appear, this measure was carried into execution without confusion, and without bloodshed. When the whole body were expelled, they were directed to proceed to some villages in the vicinity. Being deprived of the power of resistance, they were forced to obey.

Though his numbers exceeded those of his enemy in a proportion of nearly a hundred to one, he appears to have proceeded with a caution which proved that he thought there was much to apprehend from the bold enterprise of his enemy : nor was he mistaken. When he had arrived at a villagef near the celebrated ruins of Persepolis, his camp was suddenly attacked by Lootf Aly Khan ; who, animated with a courage equal to that of any of the heroes who had ever feasted in those halls near which he fought, had determined to make one great struggle for the crown of Persia. He was successful in surprising the advanced guard of Aga Mahomed Khan's army, which he defeated; and, accom panying the fugitives to their camp with a band of only a few hundred men, he attacked upwards of thirty thousand. The dark ness of the night, the fears that were communicated by those who had fled fiom the advance, and the terror of his name, created a dismay and confusion which, at one period, promised complete success J. Almost the whole of Aga Mahomed Khan's army dis persed , and the assailants had arrived at the royal quarters, when a chief, who had joined Lootf Aly Khan, assured him that the Kujur monarch was among the fugitives, and entreated that he would Some authors state that he had forty thousand men ; but this number is an exaggeration. + The name of this village is Miiyen.

Lootf Aly Khan directed his men to halt, and not to enter the royal pavilion: they obeyed, but dispersed to plunder in other directions. When that morning dawned which was to have beheld him a conqueror, he heard, with dismay, the public crier in the enemy's camp call to prayers J; which announced to those that remained of Aga Mahomed Khan's army that their sovereign was at his post. He had never left it: and when he found it impossible to remedy the confusion into which his troops were thrown, he had remained stationary at his quarters, surrounded by some of his guards, expecting, from the small numbers of the enemy, and their want of discipline, the very event which had occurred.

This daring attempt of Lootf Aly Khan to recover his power ought not to be deemed an act of desperate temerity, in which success was impossible. That prince well knew from experience, that in an army composed like the one which he attacked, confusion, if once introduced, was likely to become irremediable. He also knew, that in the actual state of Persia the minds of a number of chiefs of tribes fluctuated between him and Aga Mahomed Khan. * Aly Rez&amp;'s History of the Zund Family. t The name of this chief was Meerza Futteh Ullah Ardillanee.

These leaders, it was obvious, from recent occurrences, always acted upon the impulse of the moment: and as the part they took was blindly adopted by their followers, he had a right to expect that brilliant success would turn the tide in his favour, and that he should be able to overcome his enemies with the very means they had collected for his destruction. The plan of the attack was able : he proceeded with every caution, and completely sur prised the advance corps of his enemy. The advantage he took of this first success showed at once his skill and his determined courage. Victory was snatched from him by one of those accidents which have so often decided the fate of battles and of empires. If Lootf Aly Khan deserved success, Aga Mahomed Khan had also merited the crown which the result of this day fixed upon his brow. He had evinced, amid a scene of consternation and con^ fusion, all that calm resolution and self-possession which marked his extraordinary character. His mind loved to dwell upon the events of this period : and we are told he used often to observe, that in the modern History of Persia three achievements alone were worthy of being transmitted to posterity*. First, the policy and firmness of Hajee Ibrahim, who, aided by a few shopkeepers, took and maintained for months the City of Shiraz against all the warlike tribes of that province. Secondly, the daring heroism of Lootf Aly Khan, who, with four or five hundred men, ventured to attack an army of thirty thousand ; and, lastly, that fortitude which he him self had displayed, by remaining at his quarters when all around, him fled; and that calmness in danger which made him direct ^ Persian MS.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 193 the common crier to announce morning prayers in the usual man- chap. xix. ner, that both his own army and that of his enemy might learn he was at his post, and undisturbed by all that had passed.

Aga Mahomed Khan, whose principal object was to prevent the escape of Lootf Aly, had surrounded Kerman, and had posted a strong body of men opposite every gateway.

' I wrote them,' (said the man,) ' by the order « of my master, Lootf Aly; and my fear of him when present,' (he added,) ' was « greater than my dread of you who were at a distance.' — ' Strike off his hands, and ' take out his eyes ['exclaimed the enraged monarch. The savage order was instantly obeyed. Next day he sent for the son of the man he had so inhumanly treated.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA chap . xix. upon the unfortunate inhabitants of the City of Kerman: nearly twenty thousand women and children were granted as slaves to his soldiers; and all the males who had reached maturity were commanded to be put to death, or to be deprived of their eye-sight. Those who escaped his cruelty, owed their safety neither to mercy nor to flight, but to the fatigue of their executioners, who only ceased to be the instruments of glutting the revengeful spirit of their enraged monarch, when they were themselves exhausted with the work of blood. The numbers that were slain upon this memorable occasion were great, and exceeded even those who were deprived of sight; though the latter are said to have amounted to seven thousand*. Many of these miserable wretches are still alive. Some, who subsist on charity f, wander over Persia, and recount, to all who will listen to the tale, the horrors of this day of calamity. ' Tell your father/ (said he,) ' that the prophet has upbraided me in a dream for my ' cruel usage of him : what can I do to repair the injuries I have done ' He will ' desire, if he lives,' (said the youth,) ' to pass the remainder of his days at the tomb ' of the holy Aly, at Nujuff.' The king immediately directed that mules, tents, and every necessary equipment, should be furnished for his journey. He also sent him a present of three hundred tomans, (about three hundred pounds sterling,) and entreated the young man to solicit his father to forgive him, and to remember him in his prayers. * I follow the MS. of a contemporary writer. When I have asked any of the chiefs who were present at this massacre how many men were deprived of sight, their answer was always the same: ' Many thousands.' It has been stated, that Aga Mahomed Khan directed that a number of pounds weight of eyes should be brought him: nor is the tale in the least incredible. ■f* When at Shiraz on the fourth of June 1800, I thought that the best mode in which I could celebrate the birth-day of our beloved monarch was to distribute alms to the poor: a great number assembled, and among them were more than a hundred men whose eyes had been taken out at Kerman.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 199 Lootf Aly Khan was at first kindly received by the Governor chap. xix. of Nermansheer; but that chief inquired anxiously after his brother, The conduct who had accompanied the prince to Kerman * : he was told that he of the Gover- ii -iii i • • &lt; nor of Ner- would soon arrive: but three days, passed in anxious expectation, mansheer.

His love for his brother, and his fears for his own safety, silenced the dictates of honour and of good faith: he determined who deter- 1 , /*&gt; i • _ _ t * ^ mines to seize to seize his royal guest, and to oner him as a ransom for the life Lootf Aiy and pardon of one who was dearer to him.

Soon after their departure, the approach of a party is surrounded, of armed men convinced him that the information which he had contemned was too true. He grasped his sword, and rushed upon those who were advancing to seize him. A momentary terror prevailed; and the prince was already on the back of his favourite * Aly Reza's History of the Zund Family. t One of the persons who were with him upon this occasion, and whose name was Khodah-buksh, fled to India. He afterwards obtained a small command of horse in the service of the Nizam of the Deckan, and was attached to a party that served under me in the campaign of 1799 against Seringapatam. The account he gave of the life of Lootf Aly Khan, and of his conduct upon this occasion, exactly corresponds with that of the historian, Aly Rez&amp;.200 CHAP. XIX.

Lootf Aly Khan started up again, and renewed an unequal contest, in which he at last fell, having received two severe wounds, one upon his arm, and the other upon his head. In this state he was carried to the camp of Aga Mahomed Khan. The page of history would be stained-f by a recital of the indignities which were offered to the royal captive when brought to the presence of his cruel and im placable enemy. Suffice it to observe, that his eyes were torn out, and that he was sent a prisoner to Teheran, to languish out a miserable and protracted existence, far from his native province, and from all those to whom his name was dear; but the fears of his conqueror made him at last humane; and an order w T as sent to put a period to the life of a prince, who, even in the wretched state to which he had been reduced, was still an object of dread J to the proudest and most powerful of his enemies. # The name of this horse was Kurrund. He was of the Arabian blood, but bred in Persia. Though a low horse, his activity and strength were wonderful; and credi bility is staggered with the accounts which all Persians concur in giving of his speed, and of the extraordinary distance which he at different times carried his royal master, who regarded and treated him with the greatest affection and care. f The brutal insults offered to Lootf Aly when he was carried before Aga Mahomed are too shocking to be described. The English reader would revolt from the narration of a scene which disgraced human nature. J Though Aga Mahomed Khan cherished the most implacable resentment against all the Zund family, and particularly this prince, he, nevertheless, admired his character. We are told, that some time before he took Kerman, he received accounts that his nephew and heir, the present king, had several sons born to him in one night. ' May ' God grant,' said Aga Mahomed, ' that one of them may resemble Lootf Aly ' Khan !'— Persian MS.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 201 *((! •ami His character. Lootf Alj Khan terminated his extraordinary career before chap. xix. he was twentj-five years of age. There is in the character of this young prince, and in the events of his life, that which must excite both pity and admiration: but, amid the blaze of his achievements, we can discover nothing but the qualities of a soldier. Had he been born to the undisputed sovereignty of a large kingdom at a period when allegiance to the reigning prince was at once a habit and a principle, his fame might have emulated that of a Chenghiz, or a Timour. But in the condition of his country at the time he succeeded to the throne, every quality he possessed (except his personal valour, and his ability as a leader,) was against him. He had knowledge without prudence; and his judgment was subdued by his passions. His pride was extreme; and, even when his fortune was at the lowest, he scorned to use any efforts to con ciliate or attach those whom he considered himself born to com mand. He was violent and unrelenting, and never tried to conquer by other means than by fear; and wherever success favoured him, he used his power with a severity which might have strengthened an established ruler, but which could have no effect but that of creating enemies to one who, like him, was always struggling against the stream of adversity. But his faults, which were numerous, have been forgotten by his countrymen, who speak only of the manly beauty, the elevated courage, and the cruel destiny, of the last prince of the family of Kurreem Khan. The princes of the Zund dynasty ruled over a great part of Persia for nearly half a century ; but, from the death of their founder, Kur reem Khan, their power had never possessed any stability. This is, in the first place, to be attributed to their internal divisions; and, V0£. II. 2 D202 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xix. in the second, to the genius of their enemy, Aga Mahomed Khan. That monarch had, from the hour he fled from Shiraz, laboured incessantly to destroy them; and his task was now completed. He owed this triumph more to his foresight and perseverance, than to any brilliant successes of his arms. His present object was to prevent the claims of those he had subdued ever being revived ; almost every person* who could have formed the most remote pretensions, from his birth, to the throne, was put to death, or deprived of sight; and not only the tribe of Zund, but all those who had been the active sup porters of the family of Kurreem Khan, were removed from the province of Fars into the most distant quarters of the kingdom. It has been before mentioned, that the native tribes of Persia had been encouraged by that monarch to assert the superiority which had be longed, in former days, to their ancestors. Their efforts had been successful; and they had, for a short period, enjoyed power: but their use of it had not been such as to lead the more peaceable inhabitants of Persia to regret their downfal. This race of men were brave and warlike; but the habits of long subjection had rendered them even more rude and barbarous than those who rose to fortune upon their ruins. * Abdullti Khan, the uncle of Lootf Aly Khan, was, I believe, the only exception. He had married the sister of Hajee Aly Kooli Khan of Kazeroon, and his pardon was granted in consideration of that chief, for whom Aga Mahomed Khan had great regard and respect.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 203 CHAPTER XX. An Account of the State of Persia, and of the Neighbouring Nations, at the Period of the Establishment of the Power of Aga Mahomed Khan, the Founder of the Reigning Family. Before we proceed to give the history of the family which now chap. xx. occupies the throne of Persia, a chapter must be devoted to a review of the actual condition of that kingdom, and of the neigh bouring states, at the moment that Aga Mahomed Khan overcame the last prince of the Zund dynasty. By referring to the situation in which the provinces of the empire then were, and to that of adjoining countries, we shall better understand the progress which the reigning dynasty have made to establish their power, and to restore Persia to that rank which it once held among Asiatic nations. At the death of Lootf Aly Khan, we may pronounce that Provinces un der the actual Aga Mahomed Khan was the actual, as well as acknowledged, rule of Aga sovereign of the provinces of Asterabad, of Mazenderan, of Ghilan, Kha^af the of the whole of Irak, of Fars, and of Kerman. The situation JyKhl^ 0 ^ of these countries, which extend from the Caspian Sea to the Persian Gulf, could only be deemed settled and obedient by a comparison of their condition to Khorassan, and other parts ofTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xx. the empire, which had been broken into a number of petty principalities at the death of N^dir Shah; and had, subsequent to that event, thrown off their allegiance to those rulers who assumed the title of sovereigns of Persia. The territories which were at this period under the rule of Aga oftnbes^^^ ■^ a ^ 0me ^ Khan had enjoyed tranquillity during the latter years of the death of the reign of Kurreem Khan, but since his death they had become a Kurreem Khan to the scene of continual contests. Though the efforts to obtain the crown accession ofiji i- • i Aga Maho- * ia d been limited to the descendants of that prince, and their enemy, Aga Mahomed Khan, the necessity which each pretender had in his turn experienced for the support of the chiefs of tribes, had elevated that class into a consequence much beyond what they had ever before possessed. The events which have been related, show that the attach ment of these chiefs to the cause they had adopted was seldom to be depended upon. It rested upon no honourable basis; and defection, from being common, had almost ceased to be considered as disgrace ful. A selfish feeling had taken place of that spirit of loyalty for which the nobles of Persia were once distinguished, and their descendants showed, even in action, a cautious prudence, which rendered their courage as equivocal as their faith. The greatest of those engagements which the native historians of this period describe, deserve no other name than that of trifling skirmishes. When the armies met, a few men (generally of the tribe of the ruler for whom they fought) attacked each other with all the ardour of inveterate hostility. The other tribes almost always kept aloof till they saw one or other of these parties prevail; and then, if they did not betray their leader, they joined in flight, or pursuit, according to the issue ofTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 205 the first contest. In many of these bloodless battles *, though there chap. xx. were twenty or thirty thousand on each side, not more than fifteen or twenty were killed, and perhaps double the number wounded. This fact alone sufficiently accounts for those extraordinary victories which the personal valour of a leader, and a few brave adherents, often obtained over the most superior numbers. Though some of the chiefs of tribes were compelled to place their families at the capital of the ruler they served, where they were guarded as hostages for their fidelity, others (and among them the most power ful) had lodged both their wives and children, and the wealth they had accumulated during this period of plunder, in their native towns or villages, which they had fortified on the plea of providing against the predatory attacks of their enemies, but with the real view of ren dering themselves in some degree independent of the caprice and power of their sovereign. The condition of the military nobles, or rather feudal lords, of Efforts made Persia, was not favourable to the designs of Aga Mahomed Khan: hon^Khan but that politic prince had succeeded in uniting the efforts of his own chidTof his tribe, all of whom were devoted to his cause. To effect this object, own tribe ' he had made what were deemed the greatest sacrifices. He had for given, as has been stated, when he had the power to revenge it, the blood of his father and of his uncles, and had pardoned the grossest personal insults which had been offered to himself when in captivity. His magnanimity was rewarded by the unanimous support of his # I have had an opportunity of becoming well acquainted with many of the prin cipal chiefs and leaders who were actors in these scenes, and they all agreed in the account which they gave of the character of the warfare that had been carried on in Persia since the death of N&amp;dir Shah.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xx. tribe; and, in the condition in which Persia then was, he derived the greatest strength from their fidelity and attachment. Asterabad had long been the residence of the Kujur chiefs: it was impossible, from its situation, at a distant corner of the empire, ever to make it the capital: but many reasons combined to render Aga Mahomed Khan desirous of being near the hereditary posses sions of his family, and to the pasture lands of those Turkish tribes bn which he was in a great degree dependent for maintaining the Makes Tehe- crown he had acquired. He determined, therefore, to fortifv ran the capi- ^ tai, and demo- Teheran, which stands immediately at the base of that lofty range of lishes other . strong places, mountains which divide Irak from Mazenderan. The fortifications of Isfahan and Shiraz were dismantled. Those of Kerman* had also been razed to the ground; and the inhabitants of these cities, harassed with the sieges they had sustained, saw, without sorrow, the progress of the work of demolition: and though some of the military classes might have sighed after their lost power, and re gretted that their harvest of plunder was over, the other inhabitants of those provinces that were now subject to Aga Mahomed Khan's rule, were quite prepared, by past scenes, to welcome the establish ment of any government which promised, from its stability, to afford them an effectual and permanent protection. * This city had, at a former period, been one of the richest and most populous in Peisia, When the European factories were established at Gombroon, it became a great emporium of trade between Europe and India, and the countries of Persia, Cabul, and Tartary. The province of which it is the capital was not productive; but it boasted some rare articles of commerce, particularly the celebrated wool of its goats, which approaches nearer than any other, in fineness, to that of Cashmere.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 207 The ancient province of Carduchia, (the modern Kurdistan,) chap. xx. which is bounded to the east by the plains of Irak and Aderbiian, An account of to the west by the River Tigris, to the north by Armenia, and to the the province of Kurdistan. south by the territories of Bagdad, had, in former ages, as at present, always maintained its own rude government^; and, though its moun tain chiefs had generally acknowledged the authority of a paramount lord, they had for ages enjoyed more real independence than those of any other province in this quarter of Asia. We have evidence of this fact in the page of Xenophon -f*; which informs us, that in the very earliest periods of the history of Persia the chiefs of Kurdistan were disobedient and turbulent vassals to the most powerful of its monarchs. There are, indeed, some grounds to believe that it was the valour of this race which emancipated their country from the foreign rule of the successors of Alexander. For a short time the legions of Rome had occupied a part of Carduchia, but they had probably possession of little more than their military positions : and it is remarkable, that none of the numerous Tartar tribes who have overrun Persia, have ever per- * A Kurdish writer, in his preface to a history of his native country, states, that authors differ regarding the origin of the Kurds.

The causes which have enabled this people to preserve their soilf from strangers are obvious. Their country is mountainous and barren; and the few beautiful and fertile valleys, which are inter spersed among its clustering hills, offer no adequate temptation to reward the effort that would be necessary to its complete reduo tion : for its warlike and robust inhabitants are singularly attached to their native land; and the conquest of their rugged mountains would be found as difficult to make, as it would prove unprofitable to maintain. This race of men have never been united J under * There are some Arabian tribes in this country; and several qf the principal Kurdish chiefs boast a descent from families of that nation. 't* The historian of Kurdistan includes all the province of Laristan in that country; which, according to him, extends to the Persian Gulf. The same author states, that Kurd signifies ' valiant;' and that Roostum, though born in Seistan, was of a Kurdish family. He says, that the common reading of Roostum-e-Goord, in Ferdosi, is erro neous, and that it should be Roostum-e=-Kurd, or Roostum the Kurd.— Tuarikh Ak- harady by S heeriff-u-deen. J We are told by Greek historians, that when Artaxerxes Longimanus entered their country with an immense army, he was only saved from destruction by one of his allies fomenting a division between the two great rulers of Carduchia, that led to their consenting to a peace with that monarch. SherrifF-u-deen, in his history of this nation, asserts, that when an envoy from a chief of Kurdistan came before Mahomed, the pro phet was so struck by his fierce looks and gigantic frame of body, that he prayed to God that so formidable a race should never be united; and hence (this pious author concludes) those divisions, which have ever since continued to distract that country.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. QOg one ruler: and perhaps this circumstance, which, had they pos- chap. xx. sessed a more inviting country, must have soon led to their sub- jugation, has been one of the causes which has enabled them to preserve their independence. Their chiefs, constantly at war with each other, have always sought the protection of some great power, whose influence, or occasional aid, enabled them to preserve or in crease their territories. They have repaid the support they received by the acknowledgment of the monarch who granted it as their paramount sovereign : and, as such, they have discharged the obliga tion they had incurred, sometimes by tribute, and sometimes by mili tary service. We are not surprised to find that their most powerful neighbours have preferred the professions of allegiance and real aid, which they have received from the petty rulers of Kurdistan, to the hazard of an attempt to subdue them into more complete submission. The situation of their country, which has generally been the frontier that divided great empires, has been favourable to the policy of its chiefs: and we may conclude, that in ancient days these vacillated between the Emperors of Rome and the Monarchs of the Sassanian dynasty, in the same manner as they do at this moment between the Kings of Persia and the Emperors of Turkey. The districts of Kurdistan which lie near the Tigris and in the vicinity of Bagdad, admit the supremacy of the Turkish govern ment*; while those that are situated more to the northward and eastward profess to be under the protection of the King of Persia. * The largest half of Kurdistan at present term themselves subjects of the Turkish empire, which they prefer to Persia, as it is at this moment less able to coerce the payment of tribute, or to exact military service. vol. ii. 2 eTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xx. Among the latter chiefs, the Waly, or Prince of Ardeldn*, is by far the mos t powerful. His territories, which border on Irak and Ader- bijan, are nearly two hundred miles in length, and about one hundred and sixty in breadth. The revenues of this tract are not great; but its princes, who maintain almost regal state, boast their descent from the celebrated Salladin -f*. Their title, however, to this honour is not clearly made out; but the history of their country proves that the government of this province has continued in the same noble family for a period of more than four centuries. The patriarchal character of their rule, and the cheerful obedience of their subjects, are calculated to make the inhabitants of the rich plains of Persia envy the lot of those of the rugged moun tains of Kurdistan: but, though the Kings of Persia have seldom interfered with the internal administration of Ardeldn, and have never attempted to set aside the family who govern it, they have often exerted their influence and power to alter the direct line of succession; and, by supporting the pretensions of junior branches, * The town of Sennah, the capital of Ardel^n, lies in latitude 35° 12' N., and lon gitude 40° E., and is distant sixty miles from Hamadan. It is pleasantly situated in a small valley, encircled by mountains. I encamped at it for several days in the autumn of 1810, and was entertained in the most hospitable and princely manner by the ruling Waly, Aman-uliah Khan, the son of Khoosroo Khan, who was Waly at the period of which I am writing. i* This is the name which European writers give to SaJiih-u-deen, the famous enemy of the crusaders. The family of Ardel^n trace their lineage to this monarch through female descent; but, in the History of Kurdistan, their title to their posses sions rests upon an actual occupation for four centuries, and a succession of twenty-* five male heirs.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 211 they have obtained their object of creating feuds, which have chap. xx. rendered its rulers more dependent upon their power. Khoosroo Khan, who at the period of Lootf Aly Khan^s death was Waly of Ardeldn, had professed allegiance to Kurreem Khan; but he withdrew his support from the descendants of that prince, and became the open enemy of Jaaffer Khan, whose nephew Ismail* had fled to Sennah, and thrown himself upon his protection. The defeat which Jaaffer Khan sustained near Hamadan, was chiefly ascribed to the valour of the troops of Ardel^n; and as their chief could not hope, after such an event, to effect a reconciliation with that ruler, he was led, by considerations of policy, to attach himself to the cause of Aga Mahomed-f-, to whom he sent all the arms, and other tro phies, which he had taken in this action, as a proof of his acknow ledgment of his paramount power. From that moment, Khoosroo became one of the most powerful supporters of the Kujur monarch : and the latter, when he overcame the Zund dynasty, had a right to expect that the continued allegiance of the Waly of Ardeldn would ensure the submission of all those districts of Kurdistan which had formerly acknowledged the supremacy of the King of Persia. The family of the Princes of Armenia had been extinct for state of the north-eastern centuries: and that disunited province could hardly be deemed provinces of Armenia. * In the history of this family, which I obtained from the reigning Waly, it is stated, that Khoosroo never meant to support Ismail Khan, till the suspicions and intended hostility of Jaaffer Khan forced him to that measure. t Khoosroo Khan, when very young, had been expelled from his territories, and deprived of his birth-right. He owed his restoration to power to Mahomed Hussein Khan, the father of Aga Mahomed, and was led, by that event, to entertain a partiality to a family from whose aid he had derived such great benefit.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. entitled to the continuance of a name, which had long described a country inhabited by a brave and independent people. The greatest part of it had fallen under the rule of the Turkish go vernment ; but the north-eastern districts, which stretched along the banks of the Araxes*, and intervened between Aderbijan and Georgia, had been in general subject to the sovereigns of Persia. The chiefs by whom these districts were governed had, at no period, possessed a power which could enable them to resist the authority of an established monarch of that kingdom. The fine province of Georgia, — which is bounded to the north by the high ranges of the Caucausus; to the east, by the lofty mountains of D^ghestdn and Shirwan; and to the west and south, by the districts of ancient Armenia, — was governed by a Waly, or prince, who usually acknowledged the Sovereign of Persia as his para mount lord. This province boasts a singular salubrity of climate; and is alike famous for the abundant fertility of its soil, the luxu riance of its diversified scenes, of rich plains, clear streams, and wooded mountains, and the superior courage and beauty of its in habitants : but, for many centuries, all these apparent blessings had operated as curses to this charming region. Its inhabitants, who had continued to profess the Christian religion, were, from the situation of their country, which lay between two great Mahomedan nations, Turkey and Persia, subject to a violence and oppression, which had sunk their character to the lowest state of degradation. Independent of the evil resulting from this cause, the internal government of Georgia was bad. The power of the Waly was not only checked by * This river is now called the Arras.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. the divisions which his neighbours always fomented in his own chap. xx. family, but by the great authority possessed by his insubordinate nobles, who exercised, in their respective districts, the most despotic tyranny over their miserable vassals. In a country so situated, the richness of the soil only produced indolence. Men would not labour beyond what was necessary for their mere subsistence; and that the earth yielded almost spontaneously. The manly form and courage of the male, and the beauty and vivacity of the female youth of Georgia, made their Mahomedan neighbours always anxious to obtain them as slaves. As they lived in misery at home, and often attained the highest ranks^ among other nations, even parents did not hesitate to sell their offspring. Nobles made offerings of their vassals : and the Walys of Georgia themselves were often com pelled to send (as part of their tribute to the paramount sovereign,) some of the fairest of their family, and of their subjects-f. When * In Turkey it is the usage to promote slaves, from Georgia and Circassia, to the principal offices of government. This custom has its origin in the policy of despots, who, fearing the natural influence of the chiefs of tribes and men of high families, desire to raise those only whom they can cast down at pleasure. f Joseph Emin, a brave and adventurous Armenian, who tried m vain about this period to excite his countrymen and the Georgians to throw off the degrading sub jection in which they were held, informs us, that Kurreem Khan had sent to Heraclius to demand ' that his daughter-in-law (the widow of his eldest son,) his heir Goorgeen ' Khan, his son-in-law the Prince David, twelve noblemen's sons, and twelve beautiful ' Georgian virgins, (none of whom were to be above twelve years of age,) should be « sent to him.' These were required as hostages, and as slaves of his pleasure. The messenger who brought this demand threatened, in the name of his prince, an invasion of the country if it was not instantly complied with. The degraded nobles of Georgia urged their prince to compliance : but he refused ; and Kurreem Khan being forced toTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xx. this tribute was withheld, or any other cause gave a pretext for war against Georgia, the Mahomed an armies rejoiced at an in vasion which enabled every soldier to gratify his love of plunder and his brutal lust by the possession of Christian captives: nor had these armies much to apprehend from opposition; for the princes and nobles of this province were too divided, by the colli sion of their personal interests, to be united, even by the approach of a danger which nothing but their union could avert. There had been no period for many years in the History of Georgia at which the inhabitants of that country appeared more capable of throwing off the degrading yoke, to which it had been so long subject, than at that when Aga Mahomed Khan became the monarch of Persia. Its Waly, Heraclius, had attended Nadir Shah in his campaigns, and had gained the reputation of a good soldier. Favoured by the distractions which had prevailed in Persia sub sequent to the death of that conqueror, he had preserved his native province in a state of tranquillity: but aware that it would be im possible to maintain himself without powerful aid, he sought, and obtained, the alliance of Russia.

This celebrated region the state of contains many fruitful plains, some lofty and irregular ridges of mountains, and several wide tracts of desert. It is, except in its most fertile districts, but partially supplied with water; and, from local position, has, perhaps, been more exposed to predatory inva sions than any country in the universe. Whenever Persia was distracted by internal factions, or had to sustain foreign attack, the tribes of Tartary crossed the Oxus and spread themselves over Khorassan. It was this province which the valour of Roostum had to defend against the continual inroads of Afrasiab. The Seljookian chiefs invaded it long before their rule was extended over the other parts of the empire to which it belongs. It suffered greatly from the ravages of Clienghiz and of Timour: and, during the reigns of the first Suffavean kings, the Usbegs, who had con quered the country of Bokharah, made annual attacks upon its fields and cities. The genius of Abbas the Great checked these ruinous inroads: and the victorious sword of N^dir made this race of plun dering Tartars tremble for their own possessions. But the death of that conqueror left his native province more exposed than ever to hostile invasion : for, while his descendants, stript of the vast inhe ritance which he had bequeathed them, exercised a mock sovereignty over the City of Mushed, several military chiefs, taking advantage of the distracted state of the empire, seized upon the different forts * This province has Irak to the west, the country of Candahar and Cabul to the east. It stretches to the north as far as the banks of the Oxus ; and is bounded to the south by the arid plains of Seistan.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. of Khorassan; and, aided by the confusion of the times, they suc ceeded in establishing a number of small principalities, over which they exercised an almost regal sway; making war or concluding peace with their petty neighbours as it suited their interest; and sometimes defying, and, at others, paying homage and tribute to the more powerful monarchs by whom they were surrounded. Khorassan is peopled by many races: its warlike inhabitants boast their descent from Arabian, Kurd, Turkish* and Affghan tribes, who came into the province at different periods to subdue or to defend it: but neither their having so long inhabited the same soil, nor a sense of common danger, has softened those inveterate prejudices, or abated that rooted hatred, with which these races regard each other: and it had been the policy of the Monarchs of Persia to increase divisions, which enabled them to keep in subjection a country, whose inhabitants, if united by any feeling that resembled patriotism, would have been dangerous; for the men of Khorassan, from the robustness of their frame, and from their being continually inured to war, are proverbially brave: and NMr Shah, with the vanity of a native, but not without truth, used to term this fine province ' the sword of Persia/' Mushed, the capital of Khorassan, had been for some years the residence of the Court of Nddir Shah; and it was all that his suc cessors saved from the wreck of his dominions. It has been already mentioned f, that the generous gratitude of Ahmed Shah, the Monarch of the Affghans, had assigned it, and the districts in its immediate * The word Turkish is always used to describe the inhabitants of Turkistan, or Tartary, or those who derive their origin from that country and continue to speak its language. ^ Vide Vol. II. page 115.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. ,217 vicinity, to the support of the unfortunate Shah Rokh, the grandson chap. xx. and heir of N^dir. The city, from this period, became a scene of distraction, which was principally owing to the incompetence of its unfortunate ruler, and the disputes of Ndsser-ullah Meerza, and Nadir Meerza, his unworthy sons, who combated, with alternate success, for the sole possession of that power which was the right of their father. The chief ornament and support of Mushed is the tomb of the Imaum Rez4, to which many thousands of pious pilgrims annually resort, and which had been enriched by the bounty of sovereigns. But the sacred character of this celebrated mausoleum did not save it from the sacrilegious hands of the sons of Shah Rokh, who, in their turn, plundered its treasury, and despoiled the sacred monu ment of its most massy * and valuable ornaments, which they converted into coin to pay their clamorous soldiers. Ndsser-ullah Meerza, who had been compelled to fly, sought the aid of Kurreem Khan: but that prudent prince having declined giving him support, he returned to Khorassan, where he soon afterwards died. This event left Ndsser-ullah without a competitor within the walls of the city : but he was attacked by the chief of a neighbouring district -f*, who took Mushed, and held it for five years: after which Shah Rokh was restored to nominal authority by the arms of Timour Shah, King of the AfFghans, and son to the monarch * N&amp;sser-ullah Meerza carried away the golden railing that surrounded the tomb, and Nidir Meerza took down the great golden ball which ornamented the top of the dome over the grave, which was said to weigh sixty maunds, or four hundred and twenty pounds.

The inhabitants of Mushed were reduced, at this period, to less than twenty thousand *; and its revenues had suffered a still greater decrease; for the Usbegs (who now made constant inroads,) plun dered the fields close to its walls, and often led those who ventured to till them, into captivity. To render the wretchedness of the degraded descendant of Nddir complete, he was obliged to give a great proportion of the small revenue he received, to purchase, of neighbouring chiefs, an exemption from that attack which his weak ness invited. Shah Rokh still possessed many of the jewels which Nddir had brought from India: and we are toldf, that the knowledge of this fact had already excited the cupidity of Aga Mahomed Khan, who looked to the termination of his contest with the Zund dynasty with an increased impatience when he heard of any war in Khorassan that exposed those rich ornaments to hazard. He considered them to belong to the Crown of Persia; and he thought, till he was at liberty to reclaim them, they could not be in better custody than in that of the weak ruler of Mushed. An account of The town and district of Nishapore, which are situated about the town and district of Ni- sixty miles to the south-west of Mushed, had, on the death of Nddir Shah, been seized by Abbas Kooli Khan, a chief of the Turkish tribe of By^t J.

He became a favourite of his conqueror, who married his sister; and the daughter of the Affghan monarch was bestowed upon the eldest son of his captive. The chief of the Bydts, strong in the friendship and alliance of the Royal House of AbdMlee, returned to Nishapore, and the remainder of his life was devoted to the improvement of that town, and the districts dependent upon it: but, though there is reason to believe that he was a moderate and just ruler*, we must smile when we are told by his flatterers, that, under him, Nishapore approached its ancient splendour-f. That town, now doomed to become a fast ness for a petty Turkish chief, whose subjects lived amid its ruins, They were long settled in Asia Minor; and a number of them fought in the army of Bajazet against Timour. After his defeat, many of the families of this tribe were sent by the conqueror to the province of Diarbekir; but, having quarrelled with the ruler of that province, they went to the territories of Bagdad, where they lived till the time of Shah Tlim£isp, who brought them into Persia. One half was settled at Souj-Bulagh, a district of Teheran; and the remainder at Ashraff, in Mazenderan. They remained on these lands till Abbas the Second transplanted a number of them to Khorassan.

It is said to have been founded by a prince* of the Paishdadian dynasty, and to have been destroyed by Alexander the Great. We know that it was rebuilt by Shahpoor the First, who gave it the namef it now bears; and the statue of that monarch was overturned and broken by the Arabs, when they first took and plundered this royal city J. It had afterwards been inhabited by Sultan Mahmood of Ghizni when he was ruler of Khorassan, and was restored to considerable splen dour by the first princes of the Seljookian dynasty: but Nishapore had been subsequently twice completely destroyed by the hordes of Tartary, whose progress it had been fortified to oppose. Nothing could have enabled this city to recover the degree of prosperity it had again attained, except its fine soil and delightful climate|| : but, after all, we can only discover the shadow of its former great ness ; for those limits, which could formerly boast a population of more than two hundred thousand persons, were inhabited by less than a twentieth part of that number; and many of the fields by which it was surrounded, that were now waste, were intersected by the dry channels of innumerable canals, which showed the labour that had once contributed to their verdure and fertility. * Tahamurs. t The name is a compound of Ni Reed and Shahpoor.

His claims, however, were disputed by the next brother, Jaaffer Khan, who, after a short struggle, prevailed, and had the cruelty to deprive the brother with whom he contended of his eye-sight. The other acts of this chief were all of the same nature: and we may conclude from his character, that his subjects looked forward with satisfaction to that change in their condition which the recent success of Aga Mahomed Khan must have led them to expect. Among the most powerful of the chiefs of Khorassan, was An account of . the district and Meer Hussein Khan of Tubbus, who has been before mentioned, miers of Tub as having offered an asylum and given aid to the unfortunate has ' Lootf Aly Khan. The possessions of this chief, which were situated in the southern part of the province, were so surrounded with deserts, as to be almost inaccessible to a numerous army. Meer Hussein Khan was the chief of the Arabian tribe Ben-Shaib^n, which had been settled at Rhe when Persia was under the rule of the Caliphs of Bagdad, and were transplanted to the soil that they now in habited by one of the kings of the Suffavean dynasty. Favoured by situation, by the valour and attachment of their tribe, and by the unsettled condition of the empire, the chiefs of this race had, for centuries, maintained themselves in the possession they now enjoyed; and their rule had, at different periods, extended over several other districts of Khorassan. They had usually acknow- # He had eight sons. The manuscript I write from states, that the eldest, Maho med Hussein Khan, had no talents for rule.

The immediate predecessors * of the ruler of Tubbus had been remarkable for their courage and enterprise. He was himself deemed a sensible and moderate man, who, solely intent upon preserving * Aly Murdliti Khan, the father of the present chief, had not hesitated, with an array of six or seven thousand men, to advance to Goonahah^d, the frontier of his pos sessions, and engage an Affghan force of nearly treble his numbers, which Ahmed Shah had sent to attack him. He completely defeated them; and was equally successful in an action which he fought against still superior numbers sent by the same sovereign to revenge his former disgrace. But the gallant chief continued his pursuit of the latter force with an imprudent ardour: he fell into an ambush and was slain, after a desperate resistance: not one of the party who accompanied him either fled or surren dered ; they all fell near the body of their chief. But the enemy were ignorant of the importance of their victory, till a dying soldier, whom they were stripping, exclaimed, ' Why do you waste your time on me, when the body of the noble Aly Murd^n Khan ' lies near that well?' They hastened to inform the Affghan general of this event, who collected his fugitive army; and the troops of Tubbus, dispirited by the loss of their chief, fled before those whom they had so lately conquered. Meer Mahomed Khan, the eldest son of the deceased chief, succeeded to his authority ; and, after Ahmed Shah left Khorassan, he formed the project, not only of subduing that province, but of carrying his arms into the territories of the Affghans. He took Mushed, and several other towns in Khorassan. But his ambition was checked by the occurrence of divi^ sions in his own family ; and, after he had settled these, his life terminated in a manner not dissimilar to that of his father. He had defeated the troops of a neighbouring chief, Aly Yar Khan, of Subzawsir. When pursuing his enemies, his horse fell, and lie was killed upon the spot. He was succeeded by his brother, Meer Hussein Khan.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. ^ his family possessions, cherished no schemes of attacking those of chap. xx. others. His territories were about one hundred and fifty miles in length, and nearly as much in breadth; but great part of them was barren waste. The Town of Tubbus, which was rudely fortified, owed its principal strength to being surrounded for more than thirty miles in every direction by a desert. Meer Hussein Khan main tained an army of two thousand horse and six thousand foot; and his followers were surpassed by none in valour or attachment to their chief. The whole population of the country is not estimated at more than thirty thousand families; but many of these are affluent, and almost all of them possessed of property*. From the chief to the lowest of his subjects, they traffic in sheep and camels; but mostly in the latter, which they breed in their arid plains in great numbers. These they either sell or let; and the chief of Tubbus has generally more than a thousand camels hired out to the merchants of his own country, or to others who dwell in its vicinity. The Arab tribe of Ben-Shaib4n have now dwelt in this country condition of for nearly two centuries, under the family of their present chief. The author of a Memoir on the actual state of Khorassan observes, Kayn ' ' that they have never been expelled from their homes, (even for a ' day :) nor do they live/' he adds, ' in fear of any such calamity -f.'

At a short distance * from Tursheez, a chief, called Isaak Khan, had established an influence and power, which was, perhaps, inferior to that of none of the petty rulers of Khorassan, and which was rendered more remarkable from having been entirely created by his personal exertions. Amid the sameness of scenes of usurpation, the attention is forcibly arrested by the contemplation of a man, who had overcome every prejudice, and every obstacle that could combine to prevent his either aspiring to, or attaining authority. Isaak Khan had not even the rank which belongs to the lowest individual of a military tribe. He was born a Taujick f*, and was, according to pre judice, by birth unwarlike : but his father, who was the servant of a chief of the branch of the tribe of K4rd T^rJ, had shown himself above the duties of a shepherd, which was his first employ, and had latterly been trusted with the command of a hundred men. The young Isaak, who derived claims from the character of his father, was appointed one of the mace-bearers to his chief, whom he per suaded to depute him to Turbut-e-Hyderee, (then an inconsiderable place,) to rebuild a caravansary for the use of travellers.

But his plans, which had been chap. xx. long laid, now approached to maturity. He gradually converted the caravansary he was directed to build into a square fort; and his in trigues to foment divisions in the tribe to which he was attached were so successful, that by the time his work was completed, the chief that had employed him was slain by some of his own officers, and his sons were compelled to fly the country, to save themselves from a similar fate. These events produced feuds in the tribe of K^ra T4t4r, which added to the power of Isaak Khan, with whom all the discon tented found refuge; and, strengthened by these adherents, and by that wisdom which enabled him to turn every occurrence, amid the revolutions which surrounded him, to advantage, the shep herd's son soon became one of the most powerful nobles of Kho- rassan. He had been, in the early part of his career, greatly aided by the monarch of the AfFghans, whose army he had joined, and whose court he had visited: but when his power increased, he ventured to throw off his allegiance; and the troubled state of the dominions of Cabul left him without apprehension from that quarter. A writer, who was in Khorassan the year before that province was invaded by Aga Mahomed Khan, slates, ' that the possessions ' of Isaak Khan extend on the north to the gates of Mushed, a ' distance of more than a hundred miles; and they stretch almost ' as far south in the direction of Kh4f*.

Turbut-e-Hyderee, which he had raised from an incon siderable village into a town of consequence, was a place of great resort to pilgrims, merchants, and travellers. The Persians boast (not without some reason) that they excel all other nations in the virtue of hospitality. It is natural, therefore, that they should dwell with exultation on this part of the character of Isaak Khan ; whose Mehmdn Khdndh, or hall of entertainment, which could con tain nearly five hundred guests, was always open; and from it, none, however low, or of whatever persuasion, were excluded.

We cannot be surprised that those who have for days, weeks, and months, listened to his conversation, and partaken of his hospi tality, should spread his name in every direction. This reputation was of itself a safeguard, for the most absolute sovereigns of Asia are themselves the slaves of public opinion; and the monarch who, without an adequate pretext, should even diminish means so justly accumulated and so nobly used, would be exposed to reproach from all who had either enjoyed or heard of the bounty of this extraordinary man.

These chiefs were both dead, but their sons had inherited their possessions. Ameer Goon4h Khanf was the ruler of Kabooshdn ; and M^meish Khan, of Chinnaran. There is nothing in the history of these two nobles which merits notice. They had fortified the towns in which they resided sufficiently to resist the attack of an army unprovided with artillery: but their fields were continually exposed to the inroads of the Turko man tribes in one quarter, and the ruler of the Usbegs in the other. The former they were able to oppose: but they were compelled to purchase an exemption from the violence of the latter, by a present, or rather tribute, which was repeated every time that he made or threatened an incursion into their territories. Though the tract of country over which their authority was established was not large, it was very productive. Some part of their revenue, particularly that of M&amp;meish Khan, was derived from his superior stud of horses: these were descended from the fine Arabians brought by N4dir Shah to this quarter; and the progeny, from being crossed with the stronger breeds of the country, and nourished with rich pasture, attained to * The name of the tribe is Ghilichi.

This city was founded by Alexander the Great, and became the residence of one of his successors, Antiochus Nicator, who called it Antiocha. In more modern days it was deemed one of the four royal cities* of Khorassan, and was often the residence of powerful monarchs. When the Suffavean kings fixed their capital at Isfahan, Merv, which became the fron tier city on the most exposed quarter of the empire, was always committed to the charge of a military leader of the highest rank. In the reign of T^m^sp the First, a branch-f of the Kujur tribe had been sent to Merv; and their chiefs had, with some vicissitudes of fortune, ever since remained governors of that city. Subsequent to the death of N^dir Shah, Byram Aly Khan maintained it for a long period against the annual attacks of the Usbegs: but the contest was unequal; and the gallant chief, after a noble struggle J, was defeated and slain in an action which was fought near the banks of the Oxus.

But even royal favours cannot banish from the memory of this able and respectable nobleman the traces of his misfortunes; for he has not only been deprived of his inheritance, but has survived the destruction of his tribe, and the death of all his family, most of whom were sacrificed to appease the resentment of the tyrannical bigot from whose power he had fled. vol. ii. 2 hTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xx. firmly established in his pachalik. His mild virtues* had contri- buted as much as his wisdom and courage to the fulfilment of this object. He was beloved by the inhabitants of Bagdad, and of the cities under his immediate rule. The tributaries of his government, which included the Arab tribes •f* who feed their flocks on the banks of the Tigris and Euphrates, between his capital and Bussorah, and the different chiefs of Kurdistan, who acknowledged themselves subjects of the Turkish government, viewed Soliman Pdch^ with respect, and granted him a willing obedience: while the Court of Constantinople, after discovering that his authority was too strongly established to be easily subverted, declared itself satisfied with his rule. His moderation and good sense led him to preserve the most amicable relations with all his neighbours; and since the death of Kurreem Khan no circumstance had oc curred to disturb the good understanding which subsisted between Persia and Turkey. * I visited the Court of Soliman P£icha in A. D. 1800, and was equally struck by the simplicity and manliness of his character. This chief, like most of those who enjoy high station in the Turkish territories, had been a slave; but no unpleasant feelings seemed associated with the recollection of his former condition. After he had introduced me to some of his chief officers, he called up a person, and said: 'This, ' Captain Malcolm, is the son of my first master. He treated me with the greatest ' kindness. I try to repay the obligation by considering his son as my own child!' f The rule of the Turkish government over these tribes is very lenient: and they have been rescued, by submission to it, from a condition of continual war with each other.

This victory was the first effectual check to the power of that great Hindoo nation, whose conquests, a few months before it was gained, extended from the most southern regions of the peninsula of India to the banks of the Indus. Ahmed Shah, as has been already mentioned-f, subdued the greater part of Khorassan ; and he was acknowledged as their para mount sovereign by almost all the chiefs of that quarter. This prince was continually occupied in foreign wars. He had in fact no other means of subsisting his army, or of preserving the obedience of his turbulent vassals. He received but a small revenue from his extensive territories; for the countries of Cabul and Candahar had almost all been made over to different tribes, who, in return for the lands that supported them, gave their military service. Ahmed was too able and too considerate to hazard his power by an attempt to subdue his rude subjects into a submission that was incompatible with * This famous action was fought in January A.

He was grateful for their attachment, and patient of their disobedience; and endeavoured, by every means he could, to improve the advantage which he derived from belonging to the venerated family of Seedoozehi*. By accommodating his rule to the character and prejudices of his subjects, he became a powerful monarch. But his authority had never any other founda tion than his popularity with the warlike tribes of his nation j and as these were devoted to their respective chiefs, and distracted by internal feuds, we can hardly conceive a more uncertain or dangerous inheritance than that which this sovereign bequeathed at his death f to his son, Timour Shah f. That prince, more intent on the enjoyment than the increase of his power, seemed only desirous of repose. He removed the seat of government from Candahar to Cabul, because he preferred the peaceable disposition of the inhabitants of the latter city to the turbulence of those of the former. He maintained hardly any troops except a body of guards, formed chiefly of men not belonging to Affghan tribes; and so far from attempting foreign conquests, he allowed the great feudatories of the empire to withhold their tribute, and some even to throw off their allegiance, without an effort to subdue them. Notwithstanding his weakness and inaction, Timour Shah, aided by the impression of his fathers characterH, occupied the throne which he had inherited * Vide description of this tribe, Vol. I. page 599. + He died in June 1773.

But the repose which had marked his reign ter- chap . xx. minated with his life; and his son, Zemaun Shah, was assailed by the open or secret attacks of all his brothers, who found ready adherents among martial tribes, who hated that tranquillity which condemned them to inaction. Several of the southern provinces of the AfFghan kingdom had thrown off their dependance on the Monarchs of Cabul. The govern- stateofScind, ment of Scind had been usurped by a race of chiefs* whose ancestors were converted from the Hindoo faith; and that fine province was, at this period, under the rule of three brothers of this family, who had established an authority which was even more rude and barba rous than that which they had subverted. The countries of Seistan, Seistan, Ba- of Baloochistan, and of Mekran, had, since the death of Ahmed Shah, and Mek/an. granted no more than a nominal obedience. The chief of one of the principal tribes of the former province, though he only enjoys a revenue of a few thousand rupees-f*, and his whole force hardly amounts to five hundred men, styles himself the descendant of the ancient Kings of Persia, and adds to his name the proud title of Kaianee. This plunderer, for such he is, inhabits a small town called Jullalabad, situated amid the vast ruins of the ancient City of Seistan, or Dooshak; and among those that obey him are the for the tranquillity his territories enjoyed. This might have had that effect, as it placed him above the necessity of acts of violence and oppression. * Scind, which may be described as forming a delta where the mouths of the Indus fall into the ocean, and which, bounded by the sea to the south, and by deserts that divide it from the provinces of India to the east, is separated to the northward and westward by lofty ranges of mountains from the countries of Baloochistan and Affghanistan. f Captain Christie's Journal.238 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xx. tribe of Nousheerwan, who feed their flocks in the Vale of Sohrab* We cannot but smile when the glory of the former days of Persia is brought to our contemplation by such symbols: but the existence of these ancient names among this rude and unaltered people, the immense ruins which are found in every part of this deserted, but once flourishing province, afford the strongest evidence that there is a foundation in truth for what has ever been deemed the most fabu lous part of the ancient History of Persia-f-. Baloochistan, and great part of Mekran, were, at this period, under the rule of Nasser Khan, whose ancestors had enjoyed con siderable power over these barren countries for nearly two centuries. The conciliating policy of Ahmed Shah had induced this chief to become his vassal: but a regular treaty was drawn up between the sovereign and his powerful dependant; and one condition stipulated, that neither Ndsser Khan, nor his successors, should ever be called upon to interfere or to aid in the settlement of any of the internal disputes of the AfFghans. That chief had, since the death of Ahmed, withdrawn himself from the Court of Cabul, and his territories could not, therefore, be deemed subject to that prince.

The inhabitants of this region had, from the bet^n most early ages, made constant inroads upon the frontier provinces and of Persia; and they several times overrun and subjugated the whole of that kingdom. Four centuries had elapsed since the sword of Timour had laid waste its fields and destroyed its cities: but the traces of desolation still remained, to remind its inhabitants of what their ancestors had suffered; and they watched, with the most anxious alarm, every appearance which indicated the gathering of clouds in that quarter whence those storms had burst which had overwhelmed their country in ruin. Those provinces which lie immediately north of Khorassan, between the Oxus and the Caspian, and which formed part of the kingdom of Khaurizm, are possessed by a number of tribes, which trace their descent from some men of a Moghul family*, who are represented to have emigrated at a very early period from the northern parts of Tartary to the provinces they now inhabit. They married, according to this account, the women of the country where they settled; and, though their descendants were not deemed worthy of being ranked in the tribe of their * D'Herbelot, on the authority of Mirkhond, states, that they were of the tribe of Oghouz Khan, who was the third prince of the Moghul dynasty, being the grandson of Moghul Khan, its founder.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xx. fathers, they were, as a robust and warlike race, denominated Turkoman*, which signifies &lt;£ like or resembling tb Turks.' 'We have, in former parts of this History, made frequent men tion of these tribes. They had enjoyed large possessions in Asia Minor, in the plains of which many of them still dwell. Their chiefs had, at one time, attained sovereign power in Persia, and two families of Turkoman princes are numbered among the dynas ties who have possessed that empire. The tribes-f- which now occupied the pasture lands on the eastern shore of the Caspian, were too disunited to attempt conquest, or to pretend to power; but they were, at the same time, too bold and restless to remain at peace: and, during the whole period that intervened from the death of N^dir Shah till the establishment of the power of Aga Mahomed Khan, they had made almost annual predatory inroads into Persia: nor were their enterprises confined to the provinces in their vicinity ; they were extended into Irak. We are assured, from authority we cannot doubt, that parties of twenty or thirty Turko man horse often ventured within sight of the City of Isfahan. They expected success in these incursions from the suddenness of their attack, and the uncommon activity and strength of the horses on which they rode.

Though the hostility of these barbarians was a serious evil to the districts which they visited, they had no collective strength that could render them formidable as an enemy to Persia: but the condition of the tribes which dwelt beyond the Oxus, as far as the Lake of Arral in one direction, and the Jaxartes in another, was very different. These had been either subdued by the arts or the power of a prince called Beggee J^n, who, clothed in the humble garment of a mendicant, and deriving at one moment aid from superstition, and at another from his sword, had established his authority over the kingdom of Maverul-Naher, or Transoxania. A great tribe, or rather a horde, who dwell upon the plains of Kapchack, adopted the name of their ruler, Usbeg Khan, a prince of the race of Chenghiz. The appellation of Usbeg afterwards became that of a considerable nation, which boasted, among its people, some of the most warlike tribes of Tartary. The defeat of this race by Timour has been already stated, as well as their subse quent success against his descendant, the celebrated Baberf.

I ascertained, after the minutest examination of the fact, that those small parties of Turkomans who ventured several hundred miles into Persia, used both to advance and retreat at the average of nearly one hundred miles a day. They train their horses for these expeditions as we should for a race; and the expression they use to describe a horse in condition for a chapow (which may be translated a foraye) is, that ' his flesh is marble.' f Vide Vol. I. page 489. vol. ii. 2 iTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA.

But his de scendants continued, for three centuries, to reign over the territories of Bokharah. Their power had, for some years before Nadir Shah invaded that country, been upon the decline; and that event, by degrading their authority, may be said to have terminated their rule. The few princes who were subsequently elevated to the throne were merely pageants in the hands of powerful chiefs: and we are in formed, that when the male line of the race of Chenghiz* became extinct, a son of a pious Syud (who was said to be descended of a female f branch of the royal family,) was raised to the throne; and to this pageant, proud and jealous tribes granted their nominal * Raheem Beg, who had commanded the ten thousand Ushegs sent with Ncldir, usurped, after the death of that monarch, the chief power at Bokharah. He slew Abool Fyze Khan, and elevated his infant son, Abdool Momeen Khan: but on hearing some years afterwards, that the young prince, when practising archery, had, on aiming at a water-melon, in which he saw a fancied resemblance to Raheem Beg, said, ' Now ' for the head of Atta Baba,' (or father-tutor,) the name he gave Raheem Beg; that chief conceived he cherished designs of revenging his father, and directed his death in a manner that should make it appear accidental.

Meer Yusoof Aly (the author of the MS.) adds, that the youngest son of Abdool Raheem had been chosen by Raheem Beg, when he conquered the tribes of Khaurizm, to be their king; and these turbulent subjects had yielded an obedience to the young Syud, which they would have given to no Tartar chief.

These, at once astonished and delighted at seeing such proofs of humility and sanctity in a person of his rank, crowded around him as if he had been a prophet, and all joined with him in prayers for blessings upon his parent.

No one was allowed to approach him during this period, except some of his favourite disciples. Beggee J^n, when he first assumed the holy mantle, had adopted the tenets of a Sooffee. He now openly professed himself to be one of those visionary devotees, who, from having their souls continually fixed on the contemplation of the divine essence, expect to attain a state of mental beatitude, which leads them to despise all the pleasures of this world, and, above all, earthly power. Consistency required, that while he professed this doctrine, he should not easily comply with the entreaties of the inhabitants of Bokharah; who, wearied with the internal troubles caused by the ambition of his relations, earnestly solicited him to assume the government. The populace, who were entirely devoted to him, assembled daily at the mosque where he resided, and attended him wherever he went.

We are told by the former, that one man alone refused to join in the prayers for the Ameer Daniel. ' That noble,' he said, ' extorted money ' from me, and I cannot render the act lawful by forgiving him.' The sum was large; but Beggee J&amp;n was instantly enabled to pay it, by the voluntary contributions of his enthusiastic followers. t One of the writers of his life states, that he remained in this state of abstraction twelve months, and composed, during this period, the best of his works, the Eyn-ul- Hikrnut, or ' The Eye of Science.'246 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xx. he had acquired, was to destroy all the drinking and gambling houses in Bokharah. These are stated to have amounted to several thousands; and we are assured*, that so extraordinary was the veneration for the commands of this holy prince, that even those who were ruined by this act, aided in its accomplishment. Some of the brothers of Beggee Jan had been slain; and the danger in which his family were placed, from an increasing spirit of revolt among their own followers, led them at last to join in the general request, that he -would assume the government: but all was in vain, till the occurrence of a serious commotion in the capital, in which about a thousand citizens lost their lives, excited his compas sion. Upon this occasion, the nominal king, Abdool Gh^zee Khan, and all the nobles, assembled; and, having come to the mosque where he dwelt, they compelled him to attend them to the tomb of his father, Ameer Daniel, and at that sacred spot he was solemnly invoked to support a falling state. Apparently overcome by the urgency of their entreaties, he promised to give his counsel and aid in the management of public affairs: but we are informed, that he withheld from active interference till Nedz Aly, a chief who had rebelled during the rule of his father, and seized upon the City of Shaher-e-subz, ventured to make an inroad upon the territories of Bokharah. This act roused his indignation so much, that he accepted the title of regent, and marched, at the head of a large army, to attack the invader; whom he not only forced to retreat from the territories of Bokharah, but to abandon some of those countries of which he had for some time been in possession. Beggee * Persian MS.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. Jan may, from this date, be deemed the actual ruler of the Usbegs ; for though he never assumed any title but that of regent, and con tinued to pay a nominal obedience to Abdool Gh^zee Khan, he exercised, during the remainder of his life, an absolute and undis puted authority over his nation. No prince was ever more unani mously chosen to fill the seat of power; and his first care, after he assumed the government, was to show his gratitude to those by whom he had been elevated, by the establishment of some salutary regulations for the administration of justice, the collection of revenue, and the payment of the army. The policy of Beggee J4n made him studiously reject all those claims to respect and obedience which he had inherited from his father, the Ameer Daniel; who had not only been, for a short period, the ruler of the Usbegs, but was the chief of a powerful tribe. His artful son knew too well the jealousies and the resentments with which such claims were associated, to desire that they should appear in any shape as the foundation of his authority; therefore, in framing regulations for the management of public affairs, he gave to every institution a shape suited to his own character; and he desired always to be considered as a religious recluse, that had been compelled by his countrymen to exercise regal power; but who was resolved, as far as the discharge of his duties would permit him, to maintain, amid all the temptations with which he was surrounded, the same life of rigid austerity and self-denial, as he should have passed if he had never been called from a cell to a throne. The splendid court at which the nobles of Bokharah had been accustomed to attend, was abolished; and in its place he established what may be termed a hall of justice, at which he sat as248 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xx. president, aided by forty moollahs *, or learned menf. All who had complaints to make came to this hall; but the prosecutor was never allowed to speak unless the accused was present. No person, how ever high his rank, dared to refuse J a summons to attend this court, A slave could cite his master before it. Beggee Jdn, we are in formed 1|, listened with great patience to the statement of both parties; and, in all cases not criminal, he sent them away, with an advice to come to an amicable adjustment of their difference. If they did so, the cause terminated ; if not, he took notes, at their reappearance, of the evidence produced ; and these were given, with his opinion, to the moollahs, who were directed to prepare a fetwah, or decision, according to the holy law. The parties, even after this proceeding, had a week allowed them to accommodate their dispute; but if that period elapsed without their having done so, the sentence was passed, and became irrevocable. Criminal justice was administered according to the Koran. Robbers were punished with death ; thieves by the loss of their right hands; drunkards were publicly whipt; and the smoking of * One Manuscript states, that these courts were only held on Mondays and Fridays.

The most strict chap, xx, performance of their religious duties was enjoined to all classes: the police officers of the City of Bokharah, we are toldf, were continually employed driving the inhabitants to the mosques to hear the stated prayers J; and they were authorized to use their whips to awaken the devotion of the negligent ||.

The money that was collected was put into the treasury, which was also supplied by the Khums, or ' fifth part of all plunder taken from the enemy.' This holy ruler, in imitation of the Prophet Mahomed, claimed this share for the expenses of his government. Abdool Ghdzee Khan, the nominal king, and his family, were supported by the produce of the royal estates. The feudal usage of paying chiefs for their military service, and that of their adherents, had long been established among the Usbegs; and the heads of the principal families possessed large estates, and had rights of pasture for themselves and followers on particular tracts of country. These grants were intended to provide for their subsistence: but Beggee Jdn, when he obliged his soldiers to pay the tax of charity, enabled them to do so by giving them, according to their rank, a regular allowance in money which was paid from that public treasury to which they contributed. These institutions were in imitation of the usage of the Prophet Mahomed, and were meant to increase the veneration of the Usbegs for the character of their ruler, who gave, in his own person, an example of the most extraordinary frugality. He drew daily from the same fund from which he paid his soldiers, for the support of himself, his cook -j-, his servant, and his tutor, one tung^h each, (a coin about the value of five pence,) being the amount of the stipend allowed to the poorest student.

A sum of no less than five pieces of gold J were allotted for the daily subsistence of the mother and her infant; and an equal amount was given for the support of two other sons the moment they were born. Beggee Jdn, by this and other acts, showed that he had determined to educate his children in the enjoyment of those luxuries which he affected to despise; for he allowed his family to reside in a palace, while he himself dwelt in a small unfurnished room, or rather cell, into which persons of all classes were admitted at all hours. He was generally clad in a coarse garment, and had the appearance of a common mendicant. This vestment was seldom changed but when he went to see his family, and then the skin of a deer was thrown loose over his shoulders.

We neither can nor ought to condemn a conduct which was so successful in enabling the extraordinary man by whom it was adopted to give union and strength to the distracted and hostile tribes of his nation. No sentiment short of that feeling of reverence, bordering upon adoration, with which the Usbegs regarded Beggee Jdn, could have enabled him to accomplish the great objects he had in view; and all his knowledge, his firmness, and his justice, would have availed him nothing, had he not disarmed his enemies, and attached his adherents, by a life of privation, and the practice of the most rigid austerities. Ignorance and superstition are ever united; and the Tartars who followed the standard of Beggee Jan were easily persuaded, that a leader who contemned the worldly pleasures which they prized, and who preferred the patched mantle and crooked staff of a mendicant priest to a royal robe and sceptre, must act under the immediate direction of the Divine Being. Nor were their habits of a nature that made it easy for them to understand how any man, placed in such a situation, could, from any other motive, be content to resign those enjoyments which, in their minds, constituted the very essence and charm of regal power. The impression which the Usbegs entertained of the sacred cha racter of Beggee J^n, gave him a strength which soon enabled him to subdue almost the whole of the country* between the Oxus and Jaxartes. The army of this ruler was chiefly composed of horse; and the plan of war that he invariably adopted, was successive # The City of Shaher-e-Subz, formerly called Kesch, opposed him for some years, but was at last taken, and it§ governor, Ne&amp;z Aly Khan, compelled to save himself by flight.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 25&lt;: predatory invasions of the country attacked. After he had reduced chap, xx, almost all the tribes of his own nation to obedience, he was engaged in a war with Timour Shah, King of the Affghans, over whom he obtained some advantages; more, however, by his policy than by his arms* The reduction of Merv by Beggee Jan has been already noticed. This conquest enabled him to invade Khorassan ; and in the first year after it was accomplished, he advanced to Mushed : but finding it difficult to make himself master of that city, he informed its inha bitants, and his own army, that the holy Imaum Rezd*, who was interred there, had appeared to him in a dream, and commanded him not only to spare the holy city, but its dependencies. In obedience to his pretended mandate, he refrained even from plundering the open suburbs and neighbouring villages ; but he not only laid waste all a. d. 1794. those districts which were not deemed under the protection of the A,H - 1209 * sacred city, but carried their inhabitants into bondage. Before he returned to Bokharah, he wrote circular letters to Shah Rokh Meerza, and to the other chiefs of Khorassan, informing them of his intention to revisit that province next season. He advised them to consult their own safety, and that of their subjects, by early submission, and by the adoption of the creed of the Soonees. ' Your conversion/' he stated in these letters, ' will prove a bless- ' ing to you; and its occurrence will add to the number of the ' miracles that I have already performed/' * Beggee J^n told his followers, that the daily supplications made to the Imaum by the distressed inhabitants, deprived that sacred personage of sleep. ' I know,' ^aid he, ' that the Imaum liveth, and he shall not have to reproach me with disturbing ' his rest.'^54 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xx. Beggee J&amp;n, from this period till that of his death, made annual inroads into Khorassan. The heavy baggage, with a part of the army ? were left several marches in the rear; while the advance, consisting wholly of cavalry, spread over the country. Every man of this corps carried seven days' provision for himself and horse; and their object was, by a sudden attack, either to surprise the forts or walled villages, or to make prisoners of all the inhabitants that were travelling or labouring in the fields. These, if not ransomed, they carried into bondage ; and the spoil in general consisted equally of men, women, cattle, sheep, and grain. The leader of the Ushegs usually succeeded in extorting a considerable sum of money from those towns which he could not reduce; for as the invasion always took place before the harvest, a refusal to comply with this demand was followed by the instant destruction of every field within the reach of his followers. The plunder obtained on these expeditions was, we are told, fairly divided. A fifth part of all that was taken belonged to their ruler, and constituted, as has been before slated, a considerable part of his revenue. Beggee Jdn always led his own troops. He generally rode at the head of the army, dressed like a religious man of the poorest class, and mounted upon a small poney. He maintained, we are inform ed*, a strict discipline in his camp: but this means no more than that there was a good police, and that his soldiers yielded a prompt and implicit obedience to his orders. Attention to the duties of religion was, even amid these scenes of violence, rigidly enforced ; and a number of moollahs, or priests, marched * Persian MS.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 255 with every division. These holy men were sent, when occasion chap . xx. required, as envoys to negotiate with the chiefs whose territories were attacked. They were fitted for this employ from their superior education ; and they were protected by their sacred character from those insults and dangers to which persons of any other class would have been exposed. The policy of Beggee J4n, while it led him to condemn himself to every privation, made him desire to be surrounded with splen dour; and nothing could present a greater contrast^, than the mean and disgusting appearance of this extraordinary man, and all that personally appertained to him, with the display of wealth and magnificence made by his nobles and his principal officers. The writer of one of those tracts from which we have taken his history, was in the employ of Mameish Khan, chief of Chinnaran, when Beggee J^n invaded Khorassan. He informs us, that he was a. d. 1794. deputed to the camp of the invaders; and has given, in the form of a journal, a very curious account of his mission. Mameish Khan, it appears from this memoir, was in correspond ence with Ish&amp;n Nukeeb*, a noble of high rank among the Usbegs, and a great favourite of their ruler. To this chief he gave his envoy a letter, with charge of two colts; the one to be presented to his friend, the other to Beggee J^n. But the particulars of his mission will be best told in the words of this intelligent writer. a. h. 1209. iisrcteJ * Ish^n Nukeeb-ul-Ashraff, or ' the illustrious,' was the son of Ish&amp;,n Mukdoom, the chief of Juz^k, who had married the daughter of Ameer Daniel. Ishan Mukdoom was consequently the nephew of Beggee Jan, with whom he was always a great favourite.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. ' I was introduced,' he observes, ' to Ishdn Nukeeb, who was ^ seated at the further end of a magnificent tent. He was a man ' of handsome appearance, uncommonly fair, but had a thin beard*. ' He asked after my health, and then after that of Mameish Khan; adding, 4 Why has he not come himself?' On my making some &lt;£ excuse, he added, £ I understand the reason: had I been alone, ' he would have paid me a visit, but he is afraid of Beggee J4n/ ■■ After these observations, he rose and retired to another tent, desir ing me to repose myself where I was. A rich sleeping dress was ' brought me, and every person went away: but I had hardly laid down when I was sent for to attend Ish^n Nukeeb, who very graciously insisted upon my dining with him. The repast wa§ ' luxurious ; and an hour after dinner tea was brought, and the favourite drank his in a cup of pure gold, ornamented with ' jewels. The cup given to me was of silver, inlaid with gold. Three hours after noon, he carried me to a large tent with five poles, where a number of. persons were saying their prayers; we did the same; and afterwards returned to his tent, which we had hardly entered, when a servant in waiting announced Utkhoor SoofFee. This religious personage, for such he was, from the ^ moment he entered occupied all the attention of Ishdn Nukeeb, who appeared to treat him with the profoundest respect; and, when tea and coffee were served, he held the cup while Utkhoor Sooffee drank. We had not sat long, before an officer came ' into the tent, and told Ishdn Nukeeb that Beggee J4n desired This Tartar feature is deemed by the Persians a great deformity: the beard can not, according to their idea of manly beauty, be too long and bushy.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. &lt;£ that he would wait upon him, and bring his guest. The mo- ' ment this intimation was made, we arose, mounted our horses, £&lt; and proceeded with him. After riding a short distance we came to a one pole tent, which I judged, from its size and ' tattered appearance, to belong to some cooks, or water-carriers. An old man was seated on the grass, so near it as to be pro tected from the sun by its shade. Here all dismounted, and advanced towards the old man, who was clothed in green, but very dirty. When near him, they stood with their hands crossed, in a respectful posture, and made their salutation. He returned that of each person, and desired us to sit down opposite to 44 him. He appeared to show great kindness to Ishdn Nukeeb, but chiefly addressed his conversation to Utkhoor Sooffee*. After some time, the subject of my mission was introduced. ' I gave my letter to LMn Nukeeb; he presented it to the old man in green, who, I now discovered, was Beggee Jdn. That ruler opened it, read it, and put it in his pocket. After a short ' pause, he said, 6 No doubt Mameish Khan has sent me a good ' horse;' and desired him to be brought. After looking attentively &lt;s at the animal, he began to whisper and to laugh with those near ' him: then addressing himself to me, said, 4 Why has not your ' master sent the horse, Karrd-Gozf, as I desired?— 4 That horse * The author states, that Beggee J^n spoke to the Sooffee at times like a very young, and at others like a very old man; by which he means, that there was a mixture of the gay and grave in his conversation. t Klrra-Goz means « black eye.'

Beggee Jdn returned the ' salute of every one of these in a kind and affable manner, and ' bade them be seated : but the shade of his small tent did not pro- ' tect one half of them from the rays of the sun. Soon after their * arrival, their chief fell into a deep reverie; and, till evening prayers ' were announced, he appeared wholly absorbed in religious con- ' templation. At the time of prayer all arose, and retired. I slept ' that night at the tent of Ish^n Nukeeb. At day light the army ' marched, and passed within a few miles of the Fort of Chinnaran. ' After Beggee Jdn had reached his encampment, he sent for me, ' and honoured me with a private audience, at which he was very &lt;c affable. 4 Your master, Mameish Khan, is, I hear, always drinking 44 wine/— 4 I have not seen him drink/ I replied, 4 and cannot speak 44 to that point/— 4 You are right/ said he, 4 not to state what you 44 have not seen. Tell Mameish Khan/ he continued, 4 I have a 44 regard for him : but as to N^dir Meerza, (the ruler of Mushed,) he 44 is a fool. Bid Mameish Khan/ he added, 4 write to Jaaffer Khan, 44 of Nishapore, and advise that chief to solicit my friendship, 44 if he wishes to save his country from destruction/ After this ob- 44 servation a handsome dress was brought for me, with a present in 44 money. Every article of the dress was good, except the turban, 44 which was of little or no value. This, however, Beggee Jan tookTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. ' himself, giving me his own in exchange*, which was a great deal ' worse than the one brought for me. I took my leave, and re- ' turned to the tent of LMn Nukeeb, to whom I repeated all that ' had passed. He laughed very heartily at the account, made me ' a handsome present; and I was on the point of retiring, when two ' men came, at full gallop, with a letter from Mameish Ehan, ' stating, that, notwithstanding the protection he had received, some ' of his followers had been taken by the Usbegs. Ishdn Nukeeb ' took me again to Beggee J4n, whom we found seated in his small ' tent, upon a goat's skin. He directed the captives to be brought, ' and made them over to me. He had before written a letter to ' Mameish Khan, which he reopened, wrote what he had done, and ' again committed it to my charge. As this affair was settling, his ' cook, a diminutive person, with weak eyes, came into the tent. ' 4 Why do not you think of dinner?' said Beggee J^n, 4 it will soon ' be time for prayer/ The little cook immediately brought a large ' black pot, and, making a fire-place with stones, put four or five ' kinds of grain, and a little dried meat, into it. He then nearly ' filled it with water; and, having kindled a fire, left it to boil, while ' he prepared the dishes: these were wooden platters, of the same ' kind as are used by the lowest orders. He put down three, and ' poured out the mess.

' to be put into a dish. After all was ready, he spread a dirty ' cloth, and laid down a piece of stale barley bread *, which Beggee 44 Jdn put into a cup of water to moisten. The first dish was given ' to the ruler of the Usbegs, the second was placed between Ishdn &lt;{ Nukeeb and me, and the cook took the third for himself, sitting ' down to eat it opposite to his master. As I had dined, I ' merely tasted what was put before me. It was very nauseous, ' the meat in it being almost putrid ; yet several nobles, who came ' in, ate the whole of our unfinished share, and with an apparent ' relish, that could only have been derived from the pleasure they &lt;c had in partaking of the same fare with their holy leader. ' After dinner I obtained leave to depart. On my return to ' Chinnaran, Mameish Khan was pleased with the result of my &lt;£ mission : but he afterwards informed me, that, notwithstanding the ' fair promises of Beggee J4n, eighty-two of his people were, during ' this season, carried away by the Usbegs.' The above account is alike descriptive of the character of Beggee J4n, and of that of his court. It also shows the nature of his annual invasions of Khorassan; and exhibits a picture of despotic power, under a very disgusting but imposing garb. This artful and able ruler fully succeeded in the great object of his life: for at his death, which happened a few years after the events that have been recorded, his eldest son, Hyder Turr^h, ascended the throne of Bokharah, and assumed, as his father had always intended, both the name and dignity of a sovereign. * The author adds, ' God knows in what year of the Hejirah this bread had been « baked.'N THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 261 The army of Beggee J4n is said to have amounted to sixty thou- chap. xx. sand horse; but in his invasions of Khorassan he was seldom attended by more than half that number. Though occasionally severe, his administration was, upon the whole, lenient and just. He never assumed the title of king. On the seal which he generally used, his name, Ameer Maassoom, the son of the Ameer Daniel, was engraven in the centre; and round it was inscribed the following sentence:—' Power and dignity, when founded on justice, are from ' God; when not, from the devil/' The union of the various tribes of the Usbegs under Beggee Jdn, and the exaggerated reports of the character and success of that ruler, had spread such alarm over every province of Persia, that all who were unbiassed by family or feudal feelings, rejoiced in that termination of internal wars, which had raised an able and warlike monarch to the throne, and placed their country in a condition to resist invasion ; for the recollection of the glory of the best of those conquerors who had issued from the plains of Tartary was associated with scenes of rapine and of death. And though Persia had attained its greatest happiness * and splendour under some of their descend ants ; men, who had the prospect of being swept away by the mighty torrent, could find little consolation in the hope that it might, when its destructive waves had subsided, tend to improve and fructify the soil over which it had passed. * There can be no doubt that the happiest and most glorious era of Persian history was when that country was governed by the first monarchs of the Seljookian dynasty of Tartar princes.—— THE HISTORY OF PERSIA.

Many events of the Life of Aga Mahomed Khan have been neces sarily anticipated : but the interest which attaches to his extraordinary character, and the claim he has upon our attention, not only as the founder of a dynasty, but as the uncle and immediate predecessor of the reigning monarch, calls for a short retrospect of those causes which enabled him to attain the throne of Persia. The history of the tribe to which he belonged has been before given. When they were settled , in Armenia, the accidental cir cumstance of one part of this tribe having their pasture ground higher on a river in that province than another, first separated them into two branches, which were termed &lt;£ the higher' and ' the ' lower ^ These two great divisions were subdivided into many smaller ones. Some families took their names from a chief, or from a village-f, near which they fed their flocks. When the Kujurs * The YoukhS.ree-bS,sh and Ashak&amp;.-bash.— Persian MS. i' Thus the Kujurs of Duwcinloo took their name from Duwlinloo, a village near Erivtin, in the vicinity of which they were long encamped.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 263 were divided, and sent to different quarters of the empire, chap . xxr. by the policy of one of the Suffavean monarchs, the most considerable part of the tribe was settled at Asterabad*. This body consisted of families of both branches; and the heads of the Youkhdree, or ' the higher/' were considered as the first in rank, till Futteh Aly Khan, who belongs to the Ash^M, or ' the lower/' was nominated general of the forces of Tam^sp the Second. His station in the empire enabled this chief to assume the superiority in his tribe, but his right was reluctantly admitted; and, when he was put to death by Nadir Shah, those who deemed themselves aggrieved by his usurpation, rejoiced in his fall; and they en deavoured to involve his only surviving son-j-, Mahomed Hussein Khan, in his ruin. The young chief was compelled to fly to the Turkoman tribes, who dwell in the plains to the east of the Caspian. Several of his family J followed him into banishment; and he was enabled to carry on a petty warfare with his enemies, whom he would probably soon have overcome, had they not been supported by Nddir Shah and his immediate descendants. Adil Shah, the nephew and immediate successor of Nddir, when he established himself in Mazenderan, sent for two infant sons of Mahomed Hussein, who had some time before been made * The Ze^d-oghloo, or sons of Zead, have continued at Ganjah since the time of Abbas the Great.

Aga Mahomed did not withhold his counsel, though he cherished the most implacable hatred to the whole of the Zund family. He often related an anecdote f, which displays his feel ings at this period, and gives an insight into his extraordinary character. ' I had no power,' he said, ' of declaring openly that spirit of revenge which I always harboured against the murderers of my father, and the despoilers of my inheritance: ' but while I sat with Kurreem Khan in his hall of public as- ' sembly, I often employed myself in cutting his fine carpets ' with a pen-knife which I concealed under my cloak, and my ' mind felt some relief in doing him in this secret manner all the ' injury I could.' At the time Aga Mahomed Khan mentioned this action of his early life, the carpets that he had tried to de stroy were become his own; and he used to add, ' I am now ' sorry for what I did : it was foolish, and showed a want of ' foresight.' The misfortunes of the early life of Aga Mahomed Khan had not only taught him patience, but rendered him a profound adept # Kurreem Khan, we are informed, used to call him Peeran-wisa. This cele brated minister of Afrasiab, it has been before mentioned, was the Nestor of the Turks; and the highest encomium that can be passed on the political wisdom of an individual is to call him by his name. t This anecdote was related to me by Hajee Ibrahim, who was, for many years, the sole minister of Aga Mahomed Khan. vol. ti. 2 mcjQQ THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. ghap. xx. in the art of dissimulation; and during the very period that he cherished sentiments of the most inveterate resentment against Kurreem Khan and all his family, he had so won upon the con fidence of that ruler, that he not only gave him a liberal allow ance to live upon, the freedom of going wherever he chose in the city, and the use of his best horses, with liberty to hunt over the neighbouring country, but proposed to employ him in quelling a rebellion that his brother, Hussein Aly Khan, had excited in the province of Mazenderan. Meerza JaalFer, the minister of Kurreem Khan, prevented the execution of this design ; and Aga Mahomed Khan had the generosity, when Sovereign of Persia, to mark, by his kindness to the relations of the minister, his gratitude for his conduct*.

He might be said chap. to live on horseback; for every moment that he could spare from other occupations was given to the chase, which was, in fact, his only amusement. His heart is said to have been as hardened as his body : but the natural severity of his temper was, during the whole of his progress to that sovereign power which he attained, after a struggle of eighteen years, checked by his pru dence, which led him not only to conciliate his friends by kind ness, but to forget his wrongs, and even to forgive some of the most inveterate of his personal enemies. We cannot praise too highly the wisdom which induced this ruler, when he had the power of revenge, to pardon those chiefs of the hostile branch of the Kujurs who had not only been concerned in the murder of his father, and other relations, but who had delivered him over, when a helpless infant, to those cruel hands that had deprived him of his title to the name of man, and had rendered him, with all his power, an object of pity to the lowest of his subjects. The generous policy which terminated the blood feud that had so long subsisted among the Kujurs, gave the throne of Persia to the chiefs of that tribe; and Aga Mahomed continued too sensible of the importance of the union which he had established, ever to disturb it by the recollection of past injuries. He obtained attach ment by bestowing confidence: and among those who were most honoured in his government, were persons from whom he had re ceived the greatest insults^ in his hours of adversity. # Some of those chiefs continue to enjoy the favour and confidence of his successor, the reigning monarch.268 Enters Mazen- deran, and is joined by a number of bis own tribe.

When Aga Mahomed fled from Shiraz, he was only attended by seventeen followers. He refused to halt at Isfahan, though invited to do so; but he rested one night near Teheran, and was kindly treated by the governor of that city*. The moment he entered the province of Mazenderan-f, he was joined by a number of his tribe, who acknowledged him as their chief: but he soon discovered that he had the most serious opposition to expect from his own family. Some of his brothers J declared against him; and one of them, Moorteza Kooli, who had assembled a body of troops, proclaimed himself king. A petty war was carried on for four years with various fortune. Aga Mahomed, though at first successful, was surprised and made captive at Balfrosh, through the treachery of his brother, Rezti Kooli, who loaded him with chains, and deliberated whether he should deprive him of sight, or put him to dealh||. His prisoner had, however, secret friends among those employed to guard him; and their exertions, combined with the efforts of his two brothers, Jaaffer Kooli and Moostciphci Kooli, who remained faithful to his interests, restored him to liberty and power. His brother, Rez^ Kooli, who was compelled to fly, retired to Mushed, * Meerza Aly Nuckee. t Aga Mahomed was, so fortunate as to intercept a part of the revenue of Mazen- deran, which was proceeding under a weak' convoy to Shiraz. t Aga Mahomed had five brothers. Their names were Moorteza Kooli Khan, Reza Kooli Khan, Moost^pha Kooli Khan, Jaaffer Kooli Khan, and Mehdy Kooli Khan. These were only half brothers of Aga Mahomed Khan, being by a different mother. His own brother, Hussein Kooli Khan, had been put to death by the Turkomans, when he fled from Zuckee Khan. Hussein Kooli had left two sons, of whom the reigning monarch was the eldest. || Moollah Mahomed's History of the Kujurs. / 7TTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 269 where he died.

In his conduct towards these nobles, Aga Mahomed exhibited the most profound dissimulation. His real object was to destroy all whom he could not hope to attach; but he always tried every expedient that art could suggest for the accomplishment of his purpose before he # The citadels of Persian walled towns are called by the name of Argh, or ' ark.'

Aly Khan, a chief of the AffsMr tribe, had shown a disposition to aspire to the throne, and had assembled a number of followers in Aderbijan. Aga Mahomed, instead of treating him as an enemy, addressed a letter to him as an equal, in which he invited him to a meeting, and called upon him, by their affinity as chiefs of Turkish tribes, to combine for the destruction of the princes of the Zund family. Aly Khan, though a sensible and brave man, dreaded his designing character; and preferring a state of open hostility to so dangerous a friendship, he declined complying with his request; and, in the expectation of an attack, awaited his approach on the plains of Sultaneah*. Aga Mahomed marched towards him, apparently with an intention of giving him battle: but, when their armies met, he sent one of his brothers, ac companied only by two horsemen, to the camp of Aly Khan, to whom he delivered the following artful message in the hearing of all his officers and attendants. ' I am desired,' said he, ' by Aga Ma- ' homed Khan, to ask why two brave Turkish tribes should give ' delight to their enemies by shedding each other's blood? Let the Affsh^rs enjoy their present lands, their chief, his government-}-, and continue united with the Kujurs in bonds of friendship, which must tend to their mutual advancement, and the destruction of all their enemies. This overture made some impression upon the chief to whom it was addressed, and more upon his followers. It led to fuither negotiation, in which Aga Mahomed prevailed, and Aly Khan consented to be the first noble of his court. The army he had assembled was retained; and he was himself treated with such * Persian MS. f The Khumsa, or five districts, of which Zunjiia is the capital.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. ^ extraordinary regard, and even confidence, that all his alarms chap. xxi. vanished. When completely lulled into a fatal security, he was invited to a convivial entertainment given by one of the principal persons of the court; and late at night, when inebriated with wine, he received a message from Aga Mahomed, intimating, that he de sired to consult with him immediately on a subject of some im portance. He hastened to obey the summons; and, as it was urgent, he would not even wait to put on his arms. The unguarded chief is treache- was seized the moment he entered the palace, and had his eyes put lud'his^eye/ out, without any one of his adherents knowing what had happened. 1)111 out ' Part of his troops were, next morning, disbanded, and part taken into the service of Aga Mahomed. The whole of this transaction was conducted in a manner that prevented the loss of a life, or the slightest disturbance. The deep treachery which had deceived and destroyed a gallant rival, was dignified by flatterers with the name of justifiable policy: and there can be no doubt, that the impression of terror, which was made on a number of ambitious nobles by the fate of Aly Khan, greatly promoted the success of his artful and cruel enemy. The events that occurred in the war which Aga Mahomed Khan Aga Mahomed carried on against Jaaffer Khan, and his son, Lootf Aly, have been ^stTwith ja- related. The massacre of the inhabitants of Kerman was one of the Lo e o r tfA?y. and most dreadful of all his acts.

In surveying the life of a monarch like Aga Mahomed Khan, we should guard ourselves against those impressions, which the particular view of many of his actions is so calculated to make upon the mind. Accustomed to live under a government protected by laws, we associate cruelty and oppression with every act of a despot. His executions are murders ; and the destruction of helpless citizens (who in an assault too generally share the fate of the soldiers by whom their walls have been defended,) is deemed a horrid massacre: but we must not assume that justice is always violated, because the form of administering it is repugnant to our feelings: and we should recol lect, that even among civilized nations, the inhabitants of towns which are taken by storm are exposed to pillage and slaughter, with out any charge of barbarity being made against those by whom they are plundered, or put to the sword. The punishment of bodies of men, to deter others of similar condition from equal guilt, is, perhaps, the only mode by which uncivilized nations can be preserved in peace. When martial clans, united in name, in feeling, and in action, are so devoted to the family of their leaders, that neither imprudence nor crime can absolve their allegiance, it becomes impossible to take away power from their chief, without depriving his devoted followers of the means of opposition or revenge; and it is only by making examples of whole classes of his rebellious sub jects, that an absolute monarch, who rules over a warlike and tur bulent people, can expect to strike that terror which is indispensable to preserve himself upon the throne, and to establish the internal tranquillity of his dominions.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 373 The extraordinary rise of Nddir Shah, and of Kurreem Khan, chap. xxi. had destroyed that sacred regard for the royal family, which had so „ Condition of powerrully protected the weakest of the Suffavean monarchs. Every Persia at the leader who had followers, thought that chance might give him the Aga Maho- crown. The usurpation of the name of king was. so common, that med Khan ' the title was no longer held in respect; and men, amid the continual change of rulers, had lost their habits of obedience to the only para mount authority that was recognised by the usages of the country. This is no overcharged picture: and it may be affirmed, that when the success of Aga Mahomed Khan obtained him the rule of Persia, that kingdom was in a state of complete anarchy. The chiefs of the principal tribes cherished plans of inordinate ambition. Their fol lowers, accustomed to scenes of revolt and of plunder, were adverse to any power which deprived them of their harvest of spoil. The towns and villages had been pillaged so often, that many of their inhabitants, compelled to abandon their homes, sought relief in the practice of that violence by which they had been ruined; while others became voluntary exiles from their country. Commerce had greatly declined; for, independent of the hazards which merchants incurred from the upstart rulers of the day, the public roads were infested by plunderers, who seized upon all property that they found unguarded. There never was a character so formed to remedy the evils which Conduct pur- have been described as Aga Mahomed Khan. The flatterers, who Si™/ 8 * have praised his justice, have admitted that he had no mercy. Punishment, these argue, was never wantonly inflicted: but the vov,er ' guilty were never spared. His object was to restore Persia to a state of tranquillity; and to effect that, he resolved to destroy all vol. 11. 2 n274 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xxi. whom he deemed in any way likely to disturb the peace of the kingdom. He had, as has been shown, forgiven some of the most inveterate of his enemies : but when policy did not require him to renounce his resentments, he seemed prone to the most im placable and extravagant revenge. This disposition of his mind was particularly shown after his triumph over Lootf Aly Khan. Not satisfied with putting to death or depriving of sight* all the relations of that prince, he had the savage barbarity to dig up the bones of the virtuous Kurreem Khan, and to direct their removal to Teheran; where they were, with those of Nddir Shah, (which were subsequently brought from Khorassan,) deposited at the en trance of the palace -f*, that he might enjoy the gratification of every day trampling upon the graves of two of the principal foes of his family. Such an act could have excited no feelings except those of disgust and indignation : but on this occasion, that policy which usually regulated the conduct of Aga Mahomed Khan, gave way to a callous malignity of mind, which, by long brooding on past injuries, appears to have found delight in a base triumph over the remains of his enemies, and in the degrading and unmanly indul gence of a posthumous and impotent revenge. Every action of Aga Mahomed Khan was calculated to inspire dread among the higher ranks of his subjects : but though severe to * Zeen-ul-abdeen's Anecdotes. + A Persian poet had the boldness to write a satirical epigram upon this sacri legious act. ' The malice of revenge had,' he said, ' been disappointed; and the ' sacred depository of the remains of the virtuous Kurreem Khan was, by the just ' decree of Providence, constantly illuminated by his enemies.' This was, in fact, the case; for the place where he was interred being the entrance of the palace, had lamps burning in it throughout the night.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 275 all who exercised power, whether derived from birth or from station, chap. xxt. he was kind and indulgent to his soldiers, and to the mass of the population; and every step he took to spread the terror of his name, and to secure the crown for his family, promoted their happiness and prosperity. This prince showed, on every occasion, a perfect knowledge of the characters of those by whom he was surrounded. We have a remarkable instance of this in his conduct to Hajee Ibrahim. When he was encamped in Kerman, and that minister was proceeding to join him, one of the royal guards, who met the latter on the road, behaved to him with extreme insolence. The Hajee directed some of his followers to seize the man and chastise him : and it was in vain that those who were with him begged that he would refrain from an act which would, they con ceived, inevitably produce his ruin. ' If ^ga Mahomed Khan/' said he sternly, ' is capable of countenancing, by his protection, ' the insolence of a fellow like this to a man of my rank, the ' sooner I am destroyed the better/' When he arrived in camp, he found that the monarch had been informed of the transaction. At their first meeting, he exclaimed, ' So you have punished one of my servants, Hajee? I am grateful to you for having ' done so: you are exactly the person I require to keep these 6 * rascals in order!' A short personal knowledge confirmed all the favourable impressions he had received of the talents of Hajee Ibrahim; and he early resolved upon making him prime minister. No measure of hjs reign contributed more to his success than the employment of this extraordinary map, whose genius was suited to the high office to which he was raised, and who continued, while Aga Mahomed lived, to merit and enjoy the unbounded favour and confidence of that sovereign. \276 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap , xxr. Three of Aga Mahomed Khan's brothers, who were competitors for the throne, had fled from Persia. Another* whom he sus pected of designs against his person, was deprived of sight. There His conduct remained only Jaaffer Kooli Khan, to whose courage and enter- towards his . , 0 brother, jaaf- prise he was, in a great degree, indebted for his crown. This fer Kooli Khan • i i i i i • n • prince had always preserved his allegiance, and had been, on several occasions, the successful mediator of peace between Aga,Mahomed and other parts of his family. Though he was known to be am bitious, there never was any cause to believe that he cherished designs against his elder brother; but it was not expected he would grant equal submission to his nephew, whom that monarch had publicly declared the heir to the throne. Jaaffer Kooli had asked his brother to give him the government of Isfahan ; but his request had been refused; and he was subsequently appointed to the rule of a district in Mazenderan. Irritated at this treatment, which he suspected to proceed from a doubt of his fidelity, he tried, by excuses, to evade a summons to attend at court. Aga Mahomed was greatly alarmed at this symptom of disaffection : he dreaded the valour of Jaaffer Kooli, and feared an open rupture with a chief, who was the idol of the soldiers of his own tribe, and towards whom any suspicion or harshness on his part must appear as the blackest ingratitude. Actuated by these considerations, he had recourse to art, and prevailed upon his mother-f* to go to Mazen- * Moostapha Kooli Khan. t Olivier states, that Aga Mahomed Khan went himself to his brother, and regained his confidence by his humility and art. The violent temper of the brave Jaaffer Kooli, this author informs us, led him to load his brother with reproaches, which were patiently borne by the cool and designing monarch, who at last succeeded in lulling him into a fatal security. There is no difference in other points, except the king's visit toTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. ^ derail to try and appease her son : he desired her to promise him chap. xxi. the government of Isfahan, or any thing that would restore him to confidence and friendship. All he required, he said, was, that the brother he loved would come to Teheran, on his way to Isfahan, and assure him of his forgiveness. The brave and generous JaafFer Kooli, though deceived by these protestations, had still some hesi tation in trusting himself in Aga Mahomed's power. He at last, who is pre- however, consented; but not before he had received the most solemn cometocourt assurances of safety, and a promise that he was only to stay one night at Teheran before he proceeded to his government. When he reached Teheran, he was welcomed with every appearance of cordiality; and the night passed in peace. Next day, Aga Maho med Khan, after giving him some instructions regarding his conduct at Isfahan, observed: ' You have not, I believe, yet looked at my ' new palace; walk there with Bdb4 Khan, and after you have ' seen it, return to me' He went to look at it; and at the moment he entered the portico, some assassins, who had been sta tioned there, fell upon him and slew him*.

The latter is written by one who professes to have been a witness of the whole transaction. * In one account of this horrid transaction it is stated, that BSM Khan (the present king, who was then a boy of fourteen,) was informed of what was intended, and directed to complain of slight indisposition, and remain in the rear when his uncle reached the part where the assassins were stationed.278 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xxi. a youth,) to approach. When near, he bade him observe the corpse of the bravest of men and the best of brothers. Then loading the young prince with abuse, he exclaimed : ' It is for jou I have done ' this! The gallant spirit that lately animated that body would never have permitted my crown to rest upon your head! Persia would have been distracted with internal wars. To avoid these conse quences, I have acted with shameful ingratitude, and have sinned deeply against God and man I' These sentiments might have been sincere: the public expression of them had the effect of mitigating the universal horror at this murder: and men either believed, or affected to believe, that a desire of promoting the general weal was paramount to all other feelings in the breast of their sovereign. The Turkoman tribes, who inhabit the plains near Asterabad, have been described. They had been friendly to the father of Aga Mahomed Khan, who always found a refuge among them when in distress. They gladly welcomed a fugitive of rank, whose name and followers aided them in plundering the neighbouring countries: but they had slain his brother, Hussun Kooli, when pursued by Zuckee Khan, and had recently committed the most cruel excesses upon the inhabitants of Asterabad. These acts of aggression and violence Aga Mahomed resolved to revenge: and, having marched into their country, he retaliated with a severity that even filled their savage minds with terror. He brought away a number of their wives and children, some of whom were made slaves, and the rest kept as hostages for the future good conduct of the families to which they belonged. We are informed by the historian of Aga Mahomed Khan, that many of the high-minded His conduct towards the Turkoman tribes near Asterabad.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. ^79 women of these tribes perished by their own hands, to escape cuap. xxi. that captivity which they thought might subject them to insult or dishonour. The actual condition of the province of Georgia when Aga Conduct of Mahomed Khan had, by the subjugation of Fars and Kerman, Georgia' 0f become the Sovereign of Persia, has been already noticed. The tributary prince of that country, the aged Heraclius, taking ad vantage of the distracted situation of Persia, had, by a formal act, transferred his allegiance from the kings of that country, whose Transfers bis paramount authority his ancestors had acknowledged for centu- thetovereignl ries, to the Sovereigns of Russia. His motive for this measure of RuS5ia * was declared to be a desire to release his Christian subjects from the violence and oppression of Mahomedan superiors, and to place them under the protection of a great nation of their own religion. It was not to be expected that any Monarch of Persia, whenever that country was restored to union and peace, would submit to have one of the finest provinces of the kingdom alienated by such a transfer: and Aga Mahomed Khan, the moment he had subdued his rivals, resolved to compel Heraclius to return to the path of obedience. But before an account is given of the measures which he adopted to re-establish his power over Georgia, it will be necessary to refer to the progress of the connexion which the prince of that country had formed with Russia, as that must be deemed the immediate cause which pro voked the vengeance of the Persian sovereign. Peter the Great had, in concert with the Court of Constanti nople, formed plans for the partition of the north-western parts of280 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xxi. Persia*. These projects had been defeated by the genius of Nddir Shah: but the distracted state into which that kingdom had fallen led the ambitious Catherine to revive in part the schemes of her renowned predecessor.

' hereafter fall to his share/' The expression* of this article, and an attempt, which was made the same year in which the treaty was concluded, to form a settlement^ near the City of AshrafF, in Ma- zenderan, gives reason to conjecture that Catherine cherished plans beyond an alliance with Heraclius : but, if this was the case, circum stances must have occurred which prevented their prosecution, as the settlement in Mazenderan was abandoned, and the corps which had been sent to aid the Georgian prince was, after it had remained four years, suddenly recalled, when employed at the siege of Gunjah, which was raised in consequence of its departure. a. d . 1795.

Aga Mahomed consequently suspected them of some sinister design, and directed them to be imprisoned. The same writer adds, that they were invited to a feast, and having drank freely of the liquor that was purposely given them, they were seized; but when sent to the king, he listened to their excuses, and not only released them, but gave them dresses of honour.

That prince, though deprived, by the rapidity of the operations of Ao-a Mahomed, of the support of the Russians, nevertheless determined to meet the Persians in the field. He advanced with his whole force, which did not amount to one fourth of that of his enemy to a position at the distance of fifteen miles from his capital.

Fifteen thousand captives * were led chap, xxl into bondage; and the army marched back, laden with spoil. The condition of the unfortunate inhabitants, who had fled to escape death, and returned to mourn over their ruined houses and their desolated fields, was almost as severe as that of those who were made prisoners. The latter were less entitled to exclusive compassion, as slavery was the state to which many of them were doomed from their birth: and, if we except the great misfortune to which the younger captives f were exposed, of being educated in a different religion from that of their parents, their lot was not unhappy. The females, from their superior beaut}^, became in general the favourites of the ha rams to which they were destined ; and some of them were married to their masters: while the males, according to the usage of the country, were in general treated with kindness and partiality. They almost invariably obtained their liberty when they embraced the religion of their conquerors; and were, as they grew up, either enrolled as soldiers, or retained as ileitis * Moollah Mahomed Char, in his History of the Kujur Family, states, that the number of captives was only fifteen thousand. The accounts which I have received from the best informed Georgians and Armenians, make their number amount to twenty-five thousand; and some of these appeared to have fair data for their estimate. It is probable that fifteen thousand were taken at Teflis, and the remainder from the towns and villages in Georgia. f Numbers of those captives who had attained the age of maturity preserved their own religion, and among those were many females. I was acquainted with an affluent merchant, who told me that he had offered marriage to a beautiful Georgian, whom he had purchased from a soldier, if she would become Mahomedan, but in vain : and ' she ' prays so prettily,' he added, smiling, ' to her little images, that I have been half &lt;c tempted myself to become idolater^ TTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. domestics. In the former case they frequently rose to high com mand and station; and, in the latter, they were always favoured and confidential servants; and their children were, from being born in the house* considered in a light hardly less respectable than the relations of the family. Aga Mahomed Khan, after having sacked Teflis, marched to wards Gunjah; and being resolved to complete the subjugation of the provinces in that quarter, he remained, during the winter, en camped on the plain of Mogdm, near where the Cyrus, one of the finest streams of Georgia, unites with the Araxes. The Persian monarch had appointed one of the principal chiefs f of his tribe to the government of Shirwan ; but on receiving complaints of his vio lence and extortions, he recalled him. The inhabitants of the country he had oppressed, encouraged by his disgrace, rose in a body, and put this noble to death. We are informed, that the occurrence of this event greatly affected Aga Mahomed, and it was expected that he would make a terrible example of those by whom the murder had been perpetrated: but this ruler seldom gave loose to his in dignation, unless when policy dictated : and on the former Governor of Shirwan, who had before fled, coming to the royal camp to solicit mercy for himself and people, he freely forgave him ; and his clemency was repaid by the complete submission of that province to his authority. The chief of Erivdn J also propitiated his favour, by obeying a summons to appear in his presence: but Ibrahim * A remarkable instance of the light in which the Khanah-zad, or ' house-born « slaves,' are considered, has been given in the Life of Timour.—Vide note, Vol. I. page 456. f Moostapha Khan DewjUloo. t His name also was Moostapha Khan.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. ^ Khulleel Khan, the Governor of Shesh^h, still resisted; and as the chap. xxi. Persian troops were unable, from the want of artillery, to take his fortress, their commander was compelled to rest satisfied with direct ing all the country in its vicinity to be laid waste and plundered. Aga Mahomed Khan, though he had long enjoyed sovereign power, had not yet been invested with the royal tiara. He used to observe, that he had no title to the name of king even, till he was obeyed throughout the whole of the ancient limits of the empire of Persia. After he had subdued Georgia, his courtiers pressed him to go ^ solicited to through the ceremony of a coronation. He consented, with apparent croTn' ^ reluctance; and, having assembled all his military chiefs, he pointed a. n. 1210. to a crown that had been prepared, and asked them, if they desired he should put it on.

The leaders of his army, ihe minis ters of his court, and the princes of his family, all joined in their entreaties that he would place it upon his head, and promised that their lives should be devoted to the promotion of his glory. He complied with their request; but he only assumed a small circular diadem, ornamented with pearls -f. He refused to wear the gorgeous crown of N4dir Shah J, the rich plumes of which denoted the king doms that had been subdued by that conqueror: but the politic monarch consented to gird on the royal sabre, which was consecrated * Persian MS. t It was called the Kullah Kaiaaee.

The condition of the City of Mushed, against which this expedi tion was chiefly directed, has been before described. The weakness and distraction of its rulers had reduced the inhabitants to a state of wretchedness, that it appeared hardly possible to aggravate: but the late inroads of the Usbegs had added to their misery; and they, in consequence, looked forward with more hope than alarm to the approach of Aga Mahomed Khan, who professed that his only design was to pay his devotions at the tomb of the holy Imaum Rez4; to restore the city, where the remains of that sacred person were interred, to prosperity; and to punish those who had sacri legiously dared to plunder of its wealth the mausoleum of the holy descendant of the prophet. The real motives for this invasion were,— His motives to establish his power over Khorassan; to check the inroads of the bSw . 1 ' 8 Turkomans and Usbegs; and to possess himself of the wealth that still appertained to the miserable descendants of N^dir, against whom it was believed by many that be cherished a spirit of revenge, on account of the murder of his grandfather, and the cruel wrongs which he himself had sustained from the immediate successor of that conqueror. Nadir Meerza, who was, at this period, the actual ruler of Nadir Meerza Mushed, fled, on Aga Mahomed Khan's advance, into the Affghan territories, leaving his blind parent, the unfortunate Shah Rokh, to deliver over that city to a monarch, against whom resistance was a.d.i™. deemed to be useless. When the Persian army advanced near the walls. Shah Rokh went out to meet its leader, who, after he had VOL.

He had, on the death of Lootf Aly Khan, obtained some of the richest of those which had been brought from India by Nddir Shah ; and since his arrival in Khorassan he had recovered several of inferior value from the chiefs of that province, who had shared in the spoil of Nadir's successors, and who now surrendered a species of wealth that it was dangerous to keep : for Aga Mahomed treated, as the most guilty of crimi nals, all who retained what he deemed the property of the sove- Demandsfmm reign.

Treasures and jewels were produced, which had been sunk in wells and built up in walls: and at last, when a circle of paste was put upon his head, and boiling lead poured into it, he, in his agony, discovered a ruby of extraordinary size and lustre, which had once decorated the crown of Aurungzebe, and was the chief object of the search of Aga Mahomed. That monarch, we are informed*, the moment he heard that this jewel was found, ex pressed the greatest joy : he directed the torments of Shah Rokh to cease; and accused that prince, not altogether without justice, of being the author of the great miseries which he had suffered. He, however, most inhumanly directed that he should be immediately conveyed, with his whole family, to Mazenderan : and the wretched a. d. 1796. A.

Various conjectures have been formed of the reasons which prevented that support being given at an earlier period. An inhabitant of Georgia, Reasons who has given an account of this invasion, states, that General Gooda- Tented ^Zk vitch was within six marches of Teflis in command of a Russian force ^ of sufficient strength to have defended that capital, but that he refused to advance, though repeatedly solicited by Heraclius to come to his aid. This commander, he adds, would not believe that the danger was so imminent, but thought that the account of Aga Mahomed Khan's force was exaggerated; and, at all events, that that monarch would never attack the capital of Georgia before he had made him self master of the fortresses of ShesMh and Eriv^n. But the fact* is, that the Russian commander, who was himself at Georgievsk, and whose corps was scattered on the line of the Caucasus, could not possibly have assembled his troops and have reached Teflis in less than three or four weeks : and it is probable that the cautious Hera clius, deeming the presence of a Russian force within his territories as no slight evil, delayed calling for aid till it was too late, in the expectation that some circumstances might occur to deter, if not altogether to prevent, the advance of Aga Mahomed Khan. * I make this assertion upon the most authentic information of the facts stated. The Russian traveller, Klaproth, who gives a short narrative of the events of this period, makes no mention of the causes that prevented the Russians protecting Georgia. This writer exaggerates the force of Aga Mahomed Khan in a most extra ordinary degree. He says, that monarch assembled for this campaign two hundred thousand men.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. The impression which this event made upon the mind of the Empress Catherine is fully proved by the measures that she adopted. These were of a nature which showed her designs went far beyond the restoring of her influence in Georgia, and the future preservation of that province : she, no doubt, contemplated the subversion of the power of Aga Mahomed Khan. But whether her ultimate design was to place his brother (who had fled to Russia and entreated her aid,) upon the throne, or to have rendered the north-western part of Persia a province of her empire, is unknown, except to those in trusted with the secrets of her council. Goodavitch, the moment that the account of the defeat and flight of Heraclius reached Petersburgh, was directed to advance into Georgia with eight thousand men. A Russian general had proceeded with a small corps to Derbund, and passed the winter under the walls of that city, where he was joined in the ensuing spring by an army of thirty-five thousand men, com manded by Valerian Zuboff. That general instantly commenced the most active operations. The forts of Derbund, Bdku Talish, Shdmakee, and Gunj^h, either surrendered, or acknowledged the authority of the invaders. Before winter, the Russians were masters of all the coast of the Caspian, from the mouth of the Terek to that of the Kur, or Cyrus; and they established along the banks of the latter river a line of communication with Georgia. After these suc cesses, ZubofF, with the main army, had crossed the Araxes, and fixed his winter quarters on the celebrated plain of Chow&amp;l Mogdm*, from whence the whole of Aderbijan was open to his invasion; and the subjugation of that province was likely to be followed by an * For i description of this plain, vide Vol. II. page 62.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 295 attack on Teheran, the capital of the Persian king. The rear of chap. xxi. ZubofTs army was protected by the troops in Georgia; and a corps had been sent from Astracan to cover his left. The advance of this corps already occupied the Island of Lankeroon, on the shores of Ghilan, and threatened with immediate attack the neighbouring ports of Resht and Enzelee. Aga Mahomed Khan, when he heard of the progress of the a. d. 1796. Russians, appointed a chief of his own tribe Governor of Mushed; Aga Maho° and, having placed a force which he deemed adequate for the defence leaves of that city under his orders, proceeded towards Teheran. It was cellTow^ds too late in the season to commence operations that year*: but the Teherar, • army was commanded to assemble very early in spring; and every chief in the kingdom was summoned to collect all his adherents, ' in ' order to punish the insolent unbelievers of Europe, who had dared ' to invade the territories of the faithful •f-/' Persia had not for many years been threatened with a more a. d. 1796. 9th Nov. serious danger than that which now impended: but the storm a. h. 1211. vanished in a moment on the death of the Empress Catherine, EmpVes^Ca- which happened at the close of this year.

The countries indeed, through which it marched were friendly*: and its com mander had observed so strict a discipline, that he left, in the provinces he had invaded, as strong an impression of the justice as of the power of the sovereign whose troops he commanded. The reputation of Catherine had spread to every quarter of the East The inhabitants of Persia had heard, from the merchants who tra velled over Russia, the most exaggerated accounts of the wisdom of her internal administration, and the success of her foreign wars. The admiration which her conduct excited was increased by the consi deration of her sex. To a nation, among whom females are only esteemed as the slaves of pleasure, it was almost an inexplicable wonder to see a woman-f ruling a great empire with more than the genius of man. Her fame gave strength to her armies; and, if she had lived, there is every ground to suppose that she might have made a serious impression upon Persia; particularly if her designs had been limited, as was professed, to the object of placing an other monarch upon the throne of that kingdom: but the ultimate this army to retreat; but not one line was addressed to the commander-in-chief. We need make no comment upon the causes which could alone have produced so unex ampled and extraordinary a proceeding.

We could not have a stronger proof of the unsettled state of the country. f Catherine the Second was, during her life, known in Persia by the name of Khoorsheed Kullah,' or ' the sun crowned and the inhabitants of that country still designate her by this title, which, from being used as a term to describe the sove reign of an empire, has become in Persia the personal appellation of this empress.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. ^ success of this project, to extend the influence, if not the power chap. xxi. of Russia in this quarter of Asia, must have depended more upon the disposition of the inhabitants of Persia, than upon the numbers or the valour of the Russian army, which would, in its progress, have been exposed to difficulties that nothing but the aid of a party in the country invaded could have enabled it to overcome. Aga Mahomed Khan always expressed great confidence in his means Means devis- of repelling this attack; and the plan he had resolved to pursue was, homed ^an undoubtedly, that which was calculated, above all others, to ensure iLdTof She success. We are informed of his intentions by an anecdote that very I^ussmns • fully illustrates his character. He told the assembled leaders of his army, that the Russians had presumed, during his absence in Kho- rassan, to invade the opposite frontier of his dominions. ' But my ' valiant warriors/' he added, ' shall be led against them; and we will, by the blessing of God, charge their celebrated lines of ' infantry, and batteries of cannon, and cut them to pieces with our ' conquering sabres/' The chiefs applauded the heroic resolution of their sovereign, and promised to support him with their lives. When they had gone, the monarch directed his minister, Hajee Ibrahim, to approach ; and asked him, if he had heard what he had said to the military chiefs. The minister said he had. ' And do yxm think/' said he, ' I will do what I have told them?'—' Undoubtedly, if it ' is your majesty's pleasure,' was the reply. ' Hajee,' said Aga Mahomed Khan, half angry, ' have I been mistaken ? are you also ' a fool ?

They shall not know sleep : and, let them march ' where they choose, I will surround them with a desert When Aga Mahomed Khan learnt that the Russians had re treated, he determined to move towards Georgia. Heraclius had died soon after the loss of his capital. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Goorgeen Khan; who, on the departure of the Russian troops, dreaded the vengeance of the Persian king so much, that he had recourse to the dangerous expedient of taking into his service a large corps •f of Lesghees, a race of mountaineers, who continually made inroads into the valleys of Georgia, and whose desire of plun der was not likely to subside, from the opportunity which the fears of this weak prince gave them of indulging it. The Persian army left Teheran early in spring. When advanced within about sixty miles of the Araxes, Aga Mahomed Khan received intelligence from the principal inhabitants of Shesh^h, that they had endeavoured to seize their governor, Ibrahim Khan, but that he had fled to the mountains of D^ghestan : and they requested that the monarch would hasten to take possession of the fortress, which they were ready to deliver over to him. The moment this intelligence was received, Aga Mahomed Khan left all his heavy baggage, and a part of his army to guard it, and proceeded, with a light corps, to * I went upon my first public mission to Persia in 1800, four years after this period, and lived, during my stay at the capital, with Hajee Ibrahim; who repeated to me, in the very words I have used, his private conversation with Aga Mahomed Khan upon this occasion. f A Manuscript, written by an intelligent native of Teflis, states the number of Lesghees that entered Georgia at fifteen thousand : he adds, ' These friends were more ' to be dreaded than any enemies.'*THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. occupy the important fortress, which had so long baffled all his at- chap. xxi. tempts. He found the Araxes full, but commanded his troops to cross. The boats were insufficient to carry them over: but so great was the dread of disobeying his orders, that those who could not get boats threw themselves into the river. Many were drowned, as the stream was both deep and rapid : but the object was gained. The monarch entered ShesMh before the friends of Ibrahim Khan could make Enters an effort for its recovery : and this fortunate commencement led all A.^im. to anticipate a glorious campaign : but as the army of Aga Maho- A ' H ' mi ' med Khan were indulging in anticipated victories, one of those events occurred, which, in nations subject to despotic rule, are the chief cause of the sudden and great changes with which they are continually afflicted.

The first passion of his mind was the love of power; the second, avarice; and the third, revenge. In all these he indulged to excess; and they administered to each other: but the two latter, strong as they were, gave way to the first, whenever they came in collision. His knowledge of the character and feelings of others was wonderful: and it is to this knowledge, and his talent of concealing from all, the secret purposes of his soul, that we must refer his extraor dinary success in subduing his enemies. Against these he never employed force till art had failed; and, even in war, his policy effected more than his sword. His ablest and most confidential minister, when asked if Aga Mahomed Khan was personally brave, * In one of the Manuscripts in my possession, the following remarkable anecdote is related. Aga Mahomed Khan was subject to fits, and used to remain (when attacked by this disorder,) insensible for one or two hours.

An at tendant came up; and, seeing his situation, extricated him with great difficulty, and watched him till he came to his senses. Aga Mahomed, on seeing the soldier standing over him, was at first alarmed : but, on being told what had occurred, he thanked the man, and promised to reward him. He did so; but, in the man's opinion, not suffi ciently; and he continued, when on duty, (which was frequent, as he was one of the personal guards,) to look the king full in the face whenever he could. Aga Mahomed was so enraged at this, that he one day ordered the man's eyes to be put out. He ap peared, afterwards, struck with his own ingratitude, and directed that the poor fellow should retire to his home, and enjoy double pay for life.— - THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xxi. replied, ' No doubt: but still I can hardly recollect an occasion ' where he had an opportunity of displaying courage. That mo- ' narch's head/' he emphatically added, ' never left work for his ' hand * The first great effort of Aga Mahomed Khan's life was to acquire power; and the second was, to render it permanent in his family. Before he obtained the crown, he controlled every passion that could obstruct his rise : but when the mask was no longer necessary, he threw it aside: and, as policy no longer restrained his feelings of revenge and of avarice, he proceeded to destroy and to plunder all whom he considered in any way hostile to his government. Every chief, who was likely, from birth, or character, to aspire to the throne, was either put to death, or deprived of sight: and by this politic, but barbarous proceeding, he completely suppressed that spirit of rebellion, which had so long distracted Persia. This mo narch, we are told, had fully persuaded himself that the means which he took to preserve the throne were not directed to a selfish object: and he used often to exclaim, when speaking of his successor, the present Monarch of Persia, ' I have shed all ' this blood, that the boy, Bdbci Khan, may reign in peace-f.' The dreadful scenes which occurred at the close of the life of N4dir Shah, had effaced all those favourable impressions which were made by the auspicious commencement of that conqueror's reign: and the state in which he left the empire was every way unhappy for his immediate successors. The opposite course of moderation and # I have stated the very words of the answer made to me by Hajee Ibrahim, when I questioned him respecting the personal valour of Aga Mahomed. f Persian MS.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 303 humanity, which Kurreem Khan had pursued, was, perhaps, from chap. xxi. the condition of Persia, one cause of the anarchy and confusion in which that kingdom was plunged at his death. The means used by Aga Mahomed to remedy the evils which he found in the state, and the measures which he adopted to promote the future tranquillity of his country, and to secure the undisputed possession of the throne to his appointed successor, were completely successful: and we are reluctantly compelled to admit, that some of those acts, which we contemplate with the greatest horror, principally con tributed to this desirable result. To illustrate this effect, and to obtain a better knowledge of those causes which produced so great a change in the condition of Persia, it will be necessary to say a few words on the conduct which this sovereign observed towards every class of his subjects. To his own family Aga Mahomed was, after his power was His conduct established, cruel and severe in the extreme, except to his nephews *, own Futteh Aly Khan, and Hussein Kooli Khan, to whom he acted as a parent. He had always employed the former in the adminis tration of public affairs: and this young prince, for some years before his uncle's death, held the high station of Governor of Pars. It does not appear that the delicate relations between the monarch and his successor were ever disturbed either by sus picion or alarm; and our opinion of the character of Aga Ma homed is raised, by the conduct he invariably pursued towards the person whom he had, from the first, destined to succeed to the throne. * These were the sons of his full brother, Hussein Kooli Khan.304 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xxi. To the religious men of his kingdom, Aga Mahomed was at,;ent i ve » an ^ sometimes generous. He appeared pious; and was ligious men of no ^ Q^y regular in observing the forms of prayer at the stated his kingdom. 0 hours, but arose at midnight, whatever had been the fatigues of the day, to perform his devotions. His mind was not free from superstition ; and one author, Avho gives some remarkable anecdotes of this monarch, informs us, that after he had slain the gallant Jaaffer Kooli Khan^, he directed the corpse to be immediately removed from Teheran, that he might not break the solemn vow which he had taken on the Koran, not to detain his brother beyond one night in that city. It is difficult to believe that the human mind can either cheat itself, or expect to impose upon others, by such sacrilegious mockery. His adminis- Aga Mahomed Khan was rigid in the administration of justice. tration of jus tice. He punished corruption in the magistrates whenever detected.

The penetration of the monarch discovered at once the talents of that extraordinary man, whose plainness of manner, blunt speech, manly fortitude, and astonishing knowledge * Vide Vol. II. page 277.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 305 of public affairs, from the management of the police of a village, chap. xxi. and the revenue of a district, to the conduct of a negotiation, or the government of an empire, led Aga Mahomed to give him his en tire confidence : and, during the latter years of his life, the king would hardly allow any communication, however trifling*, to be made to him through any other channel. No confidence was ever better rewarded. The minister, though he studied the character of his master, and gained upon him by the means he took to supply his avarice, and to forward his plans of ambition, laboured to pro mote the general prosperity of the empire; and was, from his kindness of disposition, the medium of obtaining mercy to others whenever he could venture to interfere without danger to himself. The ministers of Aga Mahomed Ehan were not exempt from the attacks which avarice and policy led him occasionally to make upon his nobles and principal officers. As a mode of levying His mode of fines, he was in the habit of selling those whom he meant to bLaLothe^ plunder: and the purchaser, in order to enable him to raise the toraise,aoney sum required, was vested with power over every thing except the life of the person he bought. The king, we are told, desired to obtain a sum of money from Meerza Shuffee-f, who had been his * Hajee Ibrahim told me, that one day when part of the army was engaged with the enemy, the zumbooruks, or ' camel swivels,' were badly managed, and that Aga Mahomed Khan demanded of him in a passion why this was the case?

This trans action took place in public court; and a servant of Hajee Ibrahim advanced, and, haying ungirded the band from his waist, threw it over Meerza Shuffee, and led him to the house of his master, where, however, he was treated with kindness and attention. The Hajee endeavoured to satisfy his mind that he had acted as he had done from a knowledge of the monarch's character, who, he saw, was resolved to obtain the money he demanded, and might have had recourse, had he not offered to give it, to proceedings more harsh and disagreeable to both : and he gave a proof of his sincerity by advancing a part of the sum which Meerza Shuffee, after every effort, was unable to raise. When the amount was paid, the minister was released, and returned as usual to his duties*. However gene rously Hajee Ibrahim behaved, we are not to conclude that he was insensible to the strength he obtained from this open and public disgrace of a rival who was one of the oldest and most favourite minister owed a balance to the monarch ; and another MS. which notices the occur rence asserts, that Aga Mahomed first offered to sell Hajee Ibrahim to Meerza Shuffee; but the latter dreaded the established influence of his rival too much to venture on the purchase, # In all the arbitrary governments of the East, the disgrace and punishment of a minister are deemed no obstacles to his immediate resumption of the duties of his office.

He had seen the Zund family tribes, destroy itself; and, warned by their example, he wisely endeavoured to secure a happier fate for the dynasty which he founded. Flat terers have imputed his conduct to his unfortunate brothers, to his anxiety for the accomplishment of this object: he knew, these state, that nothing was likely to disturb that harmony which gave strength to his tribe, except contests between the members of his own family for the throne. To the chiefs of other tribes whom he did not His treatment of other tribes. suspect of ambitious designs, Aga Mahomed was neither ungracious nor unjust: but he compelled them to keep part of their family at Teheran; and, by this precaution, and employing their followers in opposite quarters of the kingdom, and sometimes removing them from one province to another, he studied to deprive them of the means of either disturbing his government, or that of his successor. The good sense of Aga Mahomed Khan led him to alter some of Alters the les ser forms of the lesser forms of his court: he would seldom allow the inhabitants the court, of his capital to come out to meet him when he returned from an expedition; and he disdained to circulate, (as was the usage,) upon every trifling advantage that his arms obtained, exaggerated accounts of his success. In all written communications made to the officers of government, it had been customary to use the most hyperbolical style. Aga Mahomed Khan insisted that the substance of his com mands should be given in plain language. The eloquent meerzas, or secretaries of his court, unwillingly adopted a change which struck at the root of all their excellence in composition: .but we are told,308 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xxi. that when they commenced their flowery introductions, it was not unusual for the impatient monarch to desire ' that they would pass ' over the nonsense, and proceed to the subject of the letter at ' once^.' But, however he despised unnecessary forms, no sove reign was ever more sensible of the necessity of enforcing the strict His support of observance of those which were in any way essential to the support nity. 7 S of the royal dignity. His minister, Hajee Ibrahim, used to recount a remarkable anecdote of his feelings upon this point. Two persons of indifferent character, but who were possessed of wealth, desired to farm a district, and had made an offer far exceeding any other which had been received. The minister, knowing the avarice of his master, thought that this proposition would afford him the greatest delight, and desired the men who had made it to attend him to the king. As he advanced, Aga Mahomed Khan exclaimed, in a loud voice, ' Who are you bringing with you?'—' Two persons/ , said the Hajee, repealing their names, ' who wish to farm a district, ' and have offered most advantageous terms.'—' I cannot see ' them,' said the monarch.—' But please your majesty,' replied Hajee Ibrahim, ' they will give nearly double what any other person ' offers, with the best security for payment.'-r-' No matter,' said Aga Mahomed, ' the money must be given up: men like them ' cannot be admitted to my presence-f*.' The royal name had been so degraded in Persia, that it perhaps required all the efforts of Aga Mahomed Khan to restore, to that high condition, the attributes in of * Persian MS. f The Hajee related this anecdote to me, as a proof that even the passion avarice, strong as it was in the breast of Aga Mahomed Khan, was always under sub« jection to his policy.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA, 3^ which absolute power must be clothed, to render it efficient to its chap, xxi, functions.

' Did you hear what the villain uttered ?' exclaimed the monarch to those who interceded for him ; ' that an ambassador ' from one he styled king was come to the earth at the feet of my ' slaves t How dared he use the sacred name of majesty, to expose ' it to such degradation! But he has suffered, and my character is ' retrieved*!' The nobleman, who committed this error, meant excessive flattery to his own monarch. Perhaps the policy of Aga Mahomed, while he pretended only to vindicate the name of king from injury, took this mode of repairing an insult which the ignorance of his servant had cast upon a powerful sovereign. Aga Mahomed Khan treated his soldiers with more liberality His treatment and indulgence than any other class of his subjects. The issue 0 f ofhlssold,ers - their pay and provisions %as in general regular : and though he enforced the strictest obedience to his orders, and allowed none to Persian MS.310 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xxi. plunder except when he authorized them, that permission was fre- quently granted ; and what they obtained amid scenes of violence and rapine, was guarded to them as legal property by the policy of their monarch. Several women and children of the first families of Kerman were brought away by the troops when that city was sacked. Soon after this event, some of the principal inhabitants were encouraged^ by the promised intercession of one of the most revered priests of Persia, to go to the capital to solicit the restoration of their wives and children. The pontiff* presented their petition, and enforced its prayer with all his eloquence. He was held in the highest venera tion by Aga Mahomed Khan; and a request from him was hardly ever refused: but on this occasion, though he had the boldness to repeat his entreaties, the monarch was not to be moved; and at last said to him, with some sternness, ' I cannot grant your wish. &lt;s I will never consent to irritate my soldiers by desiring them to ' restore what they took under my sanction. I have, however, no ' objection to the inhabitants of Kerman ransoming their wives and ' children ; nor to those, in whose possession they are, restoring them ' in any manner they choose: but I desire you to urge me no more ' upon this subject, as I am resolved not to use compulsion.' The great body of his army were naturally attached to a leader who treated them with such consideration. They knew that if they yielded a prompt obedience to his orders they had nothing to apprehend from others ; for the meanest soldier could always com plain to Aga Mahomed, who might be said to live with his troops. * The name of this respectable pontiff was Shaikh Mahomed L^hs&amp;ee.—' Persian MS.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 311 When not employed in the field against his enemies, he was con- chap. xxi. stantly engaged in hunting excursions, to which he proceeded with a great number of attendants, not merely with the view of enjoying a favourite amusement, but to inure himself and followers to continual action. Unless on occasions of ceremony, Aga Mahomed Khan was His contempt of luxury. always dressed in the plainest manner. His contempt of luxury was shown on all occasions; and his policy made him seize every oppor tunity of giving his leaders and troops a pride in those hardships and privations to which their profession doomed them. After a march, or when fatigued with hunting, he was accustomed to seat himself on the ground, and to share with his principal officers in any repast that was brought. It happened one day, as he was eating some of the hard black bread and sour milk, which form the common fare of the Persian soldier, that one of his principal ministers, who was seated near him, began to eat of the same food. The monarch instantly commanded him to desist. ' Eat as much as you like ' of your rich pillaws and fine sweet-meats,' said he; ' but never ' again let me see a fellow of a secretary*, like you, touch the ' food of my soldiers.' The minister, with an imvard smile, heard himself condemned to eat none but good and delicate viands; while the military chiefs and soldiers that sat around, felt it as a distinction to live upon a coarse diet, which their sovereign shared, * This anecdote was first told rae by Hajee Ibrahim, and I find it mentioned in a Manuscript Life of Aga Mahomed Khan. The term secretary has been used to trans late the Persian word meerza, which implies a man whose occupation is to write, and whose habits of life are civil.312 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xxi. and from the very taste of which, he had just debarred one of the first civil officers of the realm, the merchants merchants in Persia were efficiently protected by Aga Mahomed Khan; and, during the latter years of his reign, commerce revived in every quarter. This was not more the consequence of his justice, than of the general security which his rule inspired; and the extinction, through the severity of his punishments, of those bands of To the farmers robbers with which the country had been before infested. To the and cultivators farmers and cultivators he gave no further protection than what they derived from the terror of his name: but that was consider able ; for, from the collector of a district to the governor of a pro vince, all dreaded to have a complaint made against them, to a monarch, by whom the slightest deviations of those who exercised power, were often visited by the most dreadful punishment. Instances of Aga Mahomed had probably experienced great distress from his avarice. the want of money : and, in a government where credit is un known, a full treasury is most essential to the support of regal power. From the habit of amassing riches, he became, at last, avaricious in a degree that is hardly to be believed. We are informed by one writer, that having overheard a poor man, whose ears he had ordered to be cut off for some trivial offence, offer a few pieces of silver to the executioner if he would take off only a part of them, the king called to the man, and told him, that if he would give him double the amount that he had just offered to his servant, his ears should not be touched *. The peasant threw himself upon the ground to return thanks, and was going away, * Persian MS.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 3^ deeming the demand for money a mere pleasantry; but he was chap. xxi. recalled, and soon convinced that his pardon depended upon his instantly satisfying the mean avarice of the monarch. From another account we learn, that Aga Mahomed Khan actually combined with an artful religious mendicant to obtain money from his courtiers. The man met him at a place appointed, when surrounded by officers of state. The king, apparently struck by his appearance and story, ordered a large amount to be given to him, and recommended the holy man to equal attention from others. The example of the sove reign was followed by the whole court; and the mendicant received a considerable sum. It was late at night before the impatience of Aga Mahomed Khan revealed the secret. ' I have been cheated !' he exclaimed to his minister; ' that scoundrel of a mendicant, whom ' you saw this morning, not only promised to return what I gave ' him, but to give me half of what he received from others!' Horse men were sent in every direction: but the wily fellow, who had imposed upon him, evaded all pursuit, and the courtiers secretly rejoiced in the disappointment of their monarch's cupidity. These, and many similar anecdotes, are told of Aga Maho med Khan. It is probable that they are exaggerated : but, whether exactly true or not, their circulation, and the credit they receive, prove that the passion of avarice was indulged to a very great extent by this extraordinary man; whose rule, checkered as his character was by great and mean qualities, restored tranquillity to a distracted kingdom, and fixed his family upon a splendid throne. On the occurrence of the death of Aga Mahomed Khan, his a. d. 1797. army was thrown into the greatest confusion. Sheshah was aban- ^ H ' lnt ' doned; and the corpse of the monarch was left to be insulted by the vol . 11. 2 schap . xxi. Futteh Aly Klian is pro claimed king.

Saaduck Khan Shek^kee marched away with his tribe, and some other chiefs followed his example : but, after the first confusion was over, the prime minister, Hajee Ibrahim, pro claimed his allegiance to the declared heir; and, having reassembled a considerable body of troops, advanced towards the capital, the gates of which were shut on all by Meerza Mahomed Khan *, till the arrival from Shiraz of Futteh Aly Khan, the nephew and appointed successor of the deceased sovereign. That prince, though instantly proclaimed king, was not publicly crowned till the beginning of the next year. It is not the intemion to write the history of the reigning Monarch of Persia: it will be sufficient to notice, in a cursory man ner, the principal events which have taken place since he came to the throne. Saaduck Khan made a weak effort to oppose him, but was attacked, and defeated. This example of rebellion was afterwards followed by the king^s brother *f*, and a prince J of the Zund family: but these attempts were subdued without an action, and the internal tranquillity of the empire has never since been disturbed. * This respectable chief is of the Kujur tribe, but of the opposite branch to the reigning family. He had been, at one period, very hostile to Aga Mahomed; but was forgiven, and employed in the highest stations by that politic monarch. His con duct on this occasion, and on every other, evinced his gratitude and attachment. f Hussein Kooli Khan. X The name of this prince was Mahomed Khan; he was the son of Zuckee Khan, and had for some time been residing at Bussorah. He advanced to Isfahan with only twenty or thirty attendants, but they were enough to alarm its inhabitants into submis sion. Mahomed Khan only kept possession of the city one or two days; his followers dispersed, and he was obliged to fly. He was successful in reaching the Turkish territories.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 315 Futteh Aly Khan has been successful, in a series of campaigns, in chap . xxr. establishing his power over the greatest part of Khorassan; and the chiefs* in that country, whom he has not actually subdued, yield a nominal obedience, and send an occasional tribute to propitiate his Kh,&gt;r ' ssa °- favour and protection. The Affghans have, for some years past, been in too distracted a state, from their internal divisions, to support those rights which their monarchs pretend to inherit from Ahmed Shah upon this province; and its peace is not now annually dis turbed by the invasions of the Usbegs, over whom Beggee Jan no longer reigns. He died soon after Aga Mahomed; and his son, Hyder furrah, who succeeded to the sovereignty, has, as yet, per formed no deeds which can lead to a belief that he either inherits the talents, or the power, of his extraordinary parent and predecessor. The Persian monarch has not been so successful in maintaining Geo^ai, the north-western frontier of his kingdom. Georgia, after a warfare SXT continued with various fortune for many years, has at last become a province of Russia; and the garrisons of that nation now extend to the banks of the Araxes, and along the southern shores of the Caspian.

This policy had the temporary success which was desired, of diverting the Affghans from their meditated invasion of India; and an impression was made of the power of the English nation, both on the mind of the King of Persia, and his subjects, favourable to the performance of the engagements into which that monarch had entered, to oppose, if ever required by circumstances to do so, the European enemies of Great Britain The establish ment of this alliance was attended with the farther advantage of promoting the intercourse, and increasing the commerce, between India and Persia. The ambition of Buonaparte gave an eager attention to every plan, which offered the most distant prospect of augmenting his means of injuring the principal power that impeded his progress to * Monsieur Langles, in his Notice Chronologique, at the end of his excellent edi tion of Chardin's Travels, observes, ' That though the names of Captain Malcolm and those of his suite are still praised by the Persians, on account of the great sums they ' expended on their route from Abusheher to Teheran, their propositions, which, were ' ridiculous, and even injurious, were rejected with indignation hy the king and his minis- ' ters!'—Voyages de C hardin, Vol. X. page 232. I can only remark upon this last sentence, that it is exactly opposite to the truth. Every object desired by the Indian government, when it sent a mission to Persia in 1800, was obtained; and that mission received from the king, his ministers, and all others with whom it had any intercourse, uniform kindness and attention.

The friendship of the King of Persia was courted, as necessary to enable him to make this attempt; and the nature of the relations between France and Russia, at this period, afforded him every advantage in the prosecution of that object. The Court of London took considerable alarm at these proceedings r and the efforts that were deemed necessary to counteract them have led to a more direct intercourse with the Government of Persia, which has, within the space of five years, been honoured with two embassies from the King of England. The reigning King of Persia had listened to the overture of Buonaparte, in the hope that the mediation or power of that con queror would enable him to recover the province of Georgia: but when changes in the condition of Europe compelled the French Em peror to abandon his designs upon Asia, he reverted to his alliance a. d. isos. with the English; who, from the relative situation of the Indian A ' H ' m3 ' territories, were possessed of means, which he saw them prepared to use, either to aid or attack him, as he determined to oppose or support their European enemies. It is not necessary to enter ipto any detail of the negotiations which have taken place between the English government and that of Persia; or to say more, than that relations of general amity subsist between these two countriesj, and have been confirmed by treaties. The object of the British nation must invariably be the same. It can only desire the strength and prosperity of a kingdom, which interposes as a barrier between Europe and its Asiatic dominions.

An Account of the Religion of the Inhabitants of Persia. The history of a nation would be incomplete without some account chap.xxii. of the belief of its inhabitants. The sacred character of religion, under whatever shape it assumes, has always given it a supreme influence over the human mind : but its effects are most remarkable when they influence the fate of nations. The feelings which it inspires in the breasts of individuals gather strength as they spread. The attachment entertained for peculiar dogmas, is heightened by the force of example, and the desire of pre-emi nence: and a creed, when adopted by a large community, becomes the strongest of all ties by which a people can be united. But this vehement passion of the soul, which ought, from its sublime nature, to be the bond of peace, has too fre quently been used, by designing and ambitious men, as a torch to kindle the flames of war. Religion has been marshalled against religion: schism against schism ; kingdoms have become powerful, not from the inhabitants cherishing a spirit of patriot ism, or of love to each other, but from a congenial feeling of irreconcileable hatred to their neighbours, on account of some slight difference in the mode or substance of their paying their adoration to the great Creator of the universe.320 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap. xxit . These observations, which unfortunately describe the general condition of human society in every part of the globe, apply, with peculiar force, to those nations which have adopted the belief of the Prophet of Arabia; who expressly commanded his followers ' to ' strike off the heads of unbelievers;' and told them, that, ' though ' God had the power to avenge himself of his own enemies, he had ' chosen them to fight* his battlesThough some of the com mentators upon that volume have tried to limit the meaning of this passage to a particular war in which Mahomed was engaged when it was written, all agree in proclaiming, that, according both to the principles of this religion and the example of its first teacher, the sword is a legitimate and hallowed instrument of conversion. In describing the religion of the present inhabitants of Persia, it is not intended to dwell upon the forms of the Mahomedan faith, nor to enter into any minute account of the tenets of the leading or subordinate sects of that country. The object is, by a general account of their religious belief, to illustrate their past history, and to enable the reader to judge of the future events that may be expected from the operation of causes connected with this powerful motive of human action. After a short view of the Mahomedan faith, it will be necessary to describe the tenets of the Sheah sect, which, from the establish- * Mahomed did not propagate the doctrine of the legality of force till the thirteenth year of his mission. H e declares, indeed, in several of the chapters published at Mecca, that he had no right to use any other means than those of admonition for the propaga tion of this faith. The law laid down regarding the slaughter of infidels, in the forty- seventh chapter, is believed, by the followers of the sect of Haneefa, to relate particularly to the war of Bedr, in which he was then engaged : but this acceptance of its meaniiig is not general among Mahomedans. f Sale's Koran, Vol. II. page 364.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 321 ment of the SufFavean dynasty, may be termed the national chap.xxii. religion of Persia. The doctrines, or rather principles, of the SoofFees, or philosophical devotees, which have lately spread very widely in Persia, will also merit a portion of our attention. The precepts of the religion of Mahomed are contained in the Koran. The principal doctrine which that prophet taught, was the unity of God; and he proclaimed, that the chief object of his mission was to bring men back to the belief of that great and important tenet of faith. There never was, he contended, nor ever could be, but one orthodox religion; and though the laws and ceremonies of that were temporary, and subject to alteration, the substance of religion being eternal truth, was immutable. He taught, that whenever this religion became corrupted, God had, from his goodness, sent apostles and prophets to recall mankind to the true path. Of these there had been several: but the prin cipal before him were Moses and Jesus*. He declared himself the seal of the prophets; and that none would come after him. =* Jesus is made, in the sixty-first chapter of the Koran, to exclaim, « O children « of Israel! verily I am the apostle of God sent unto you, confirming the law which « was delivered before me, and bringing good tidings of an apostle who shall come « after me, and whose name shall be Ahmed?.' Ahmed is derived from the same root as Mahomed, and was one of the names of the prophet. This prophecy is founded upon a paraphrastical translation of the sixteenth chapter of John in the New Testa ment, in which the Paraclete, or Comforter, is promised. This word, it is contended by Mahoraedans, should be read Periclete, or « the illustrious;' a word of the same signification as Ahmed, the name of their prophet. 3 Sale's Koran, Vol. ii. page 423. vol. ii. 2 t T322 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap.xxii . The doctrine* of Mahomed is divided by his followers into two distinct parts: the first is termed faith; the second religion, or practice. The former consists in a belief of the creed; that there is no God but one, and that Mahomed is his prophet: and the profession of this implies a belief in God, his angels, his scriptures, his prophets, in the resurrection, in the day of judgment, and of God's absolute decree and predetermination of good and evil The duties of religion or practice are prayer according to the prescribed forms, alms, fastings, and the pilgrimage to Mecca. Nothing can be more exalted than the opinion which the followers of Mahomed are taught to entertain of the Almighty. Their religion may be termed a pure Deism : for the mind is every where directed to one God, as the only object of worship; and that adoration, which is his due, cannot, according to the funda mental principle of this faith, be shared by any other object; because all else, whether animate or inanimate, is created, and cannot, therefore, be elevated to a rank with its Creator. The The existence Mahomedan is taught by the Koran to believe in the existence and purity of angels. and purity of angels. They consider them to be beings created of fire, which neither eat, drink, nor propagate their species. These angels, according to their belief, are continually employed in different occupations: some are hymning the praises of their Maker; some are engaged in recording the actions of men; while others intercede with God to obtain pardon for the sins committed by the human race.

They also believe in the existence of a number of good and evil spirits called jin, or genii, who are made of fire, but of a grosser mould than angels, as they eat and drink, propagate their species, and are subject to death, and liable, like men, to future reward and punishment-f*. The doctrine of the angels, and of the jin, or genii, in the Koran, is taken from the Jews, and from the ancient Persians; and was, probably, introduced by Mahomed to flatter the belief and meet the prejudices of those whom he sought as converts.

The period of resurrection is known to God only. Mahomed has its period only informed his followers, that even the angel Gabriel Confessed, when knowntoGod * he interrogated him, his ignorance upon that point.

A narrow bridge, termed XJl-Aruf*, divides the mansion of pain and suffering from that of joy and eternal bliss. The bridge itself forms a part on which those will remain whose good and bad deeds are equally balanced. There is another bridge called Ul-Serat, which passes over the centre of hell, and which is described as finer than a hair, and sharper than a sword : over it all mankind must pass: the virtuous and good will proceed with ease and with the swiftness of lightning; but the wicked, in their attempt to follow them, will fall into the bottomless pit.

But all these glories are eclipsed by the beautiful houries, the enjoyment of whose charms constitute the great reward promised to the faithful.

Creator; and the most orthodox have concurred in deciding, that it only applies to man considered in his spiritual state*. Notwith standing these opinions, the belief of this doctrine is very general over all Mahomedan nations, and its effects are very visible. This blind fatality renders men alike insensible to the beauty of virtue, or the deformity of vice. They meet the vicissitudes of fortune with patience and resignation, because they deem them preordained and unavoidable. They are courageous in battle., from the same motive: and this doctrine was probably first taught by the warlike pro phet, with a view of producing that effect upon the minds of his followers. Among the points of form or observance in the religion of Ma homed, the first is prayer, which he denominated ' the pillar of &lt;c faith/' The importance of this duty is often inculcated in the Koran-f. ' Glorify God when the evening overtaketh you, and ' when ye rise in the morning : and unto him be praise in heaven ' and earth ; and at sunset, and when ye rest at noon J.'

Sale, (Vol. II. page 245,) in a note upon the translation of this part of the text, makes the following remark : ' Some are of opinion, that the five times of prayer are ' intended in this passage.

Ablutions, which are enjoined on almost all occasions, are peculiarly necessary at the moment of prayer, when the purity of body is deemed essential, as an emblem of that purity of mind with which man ought to address his Creator. It is also commanded, that rich clothes and ornaments should be laid aside; these trappings of earthly vanity and power being deemed calculated to inspire pride and arrogance, which are inconsistent with that sense of humility with which a supplicant should address the Almighty. Women are Women not not allowed to join in the public prayers at the mosques. They are public pta^rs directed to offer up their devotions at home; or, if they attend the place of public worship, it must be at a period when the male sex are not there. This practice is founded upon the authority of the traditionary sayings of the prophet, and is calculated to confirm that inferiority and seclusion to which the female sex are doomed by the laws of Mahomed *. In the establishment of the usage and form of prayer, Mahomed copied the Jews, even to the position of the body at the moment of adoration ; but though he regarded Jerusalem as a sacred city, he taught his followers to believe, that a superior sanctity belonged to # The learned Sale observes, on the authority of a Mahomedan doctor of eminence^ that the moslems were of opinion, that the presence of females inspired a different kind of devotion , from that which was required in a place dedicated to the worship of God.334 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap.xxii . the Temple of Mecca; towards which he directed them to turn when they offered up their supplications to God. In showing this reve rence to Mecca, Mahomed accommodated his doctrine to local prejudices, and to the superstition of the xlrabians, who had long paid their devotions at the temple in that city, which became more hallowed in the eyes of the Mahomedan world, from being the birth-place of their prophet. ritydescribed' Charit y is a duty imposed by his religion on every Mahomedan. There are two descriptions of alms : the one, obligatory; the other, voluntary. That which can be legally demanded amounts to two and a half per cent* upon the principal of the estate of the individual; but it can only be claimed from those who have a certain amount, and have been in possession of the property subject to it upwards of eleven months. This legal alms, which is termed zukat, was rigorously exacted by the prophet; who employed it in the relief of the poor, and in the maintenance •f' of those who served him in his wars. When the religion of Mahomed spread, this tax was found not only to be difficult to collect, but of an unequal and invidious nature. It has, in consequence, been generally abandoned.

Adam, according to this account, turned towards the representation of the celestial temple when he prayed : and, after his death, his son, Seth, built a house of the same form, of stone and clay. This was destroyed by the deluge; rebuilt by Abraham, and his son, Ismail, who erected it on the same spot, and took care that it should be of a similar shape as the former mansion, which he was enabled to do from having all its dimensions explained to him by a divine revelation*. The celebrated black stone-f which stands within the Caaba is an object of the greatest veneration: every pilgrim kisses it, and hears the tale of its extraordinary history and wonderful proper ties.

It would occupy too much space to give a minute description of all the forms that attend this important cere mony : they are of a nature which the enemies of this religion have justly described as closely allied to the usages of idolatry and super stition. It is probable that Mahomed compromised with his first converts: and when he discovered that he could not withdraw them from their habitual veneration to the place of devotion of their fathers, he conciliated their consent to his faith by the adoption of this sacred object of their affection and reverence; and was satisfied, if he could transfer their adoration from their idols to the true God, to allow them to retain a small portion of the mummery of their former worship.

Friday * is the day appointed by Mahomed as that on which his followers are to assemble at the mosques to attend prayer f: but it is not, like the sabbath of the Jews and Christians, considered as a day of rest. On it the people assemble in the mosques, the Koran is read and expounded by the priests; and the day, from this cere mony, is deemed to have a sacred character: but it passes un marked by any other observance than that of attending public worship J. * Various causes are assigned for Friday being fixed by Mahomed as a day of public prayer. Some say it was the day of his arrival at Medinah. Others state, that the day received its name from one of Mahomed's ancestors, because on it the people assembled before him. It is also affirmed that it was declared sacred, because, according to the belief of the Mahomedans, God finished the creation on that day.— S ale's Koran, Vol. II. page 425, note. t Sale's Translation of the Koran, Vol. II. page 425. J Though Friday is the day that is set apart for public worship, it is not the only one in which that is performed. The mosques of the Mahomedans are always open; and. the duty of the Paish-Nam&amp;z, or officiating priest, requires him to attend three times every day at that to which he belongs—before the sun rises; in the afternoon; and after sunset. Those who are very exact in the performance of their religious duties accompany him. The priest says his prayers in the mosques, as in private, in an inaudible tone: the people, who stand behind him, also pray in silence. Once every day the Paish-Ncimclz should preach from the pulpit for half an hour, or more; but on Friday this duty is obligatory.

It may, according to Maho- medans, be omitted in cases where, from the age of the convert, or any other cause, there might be danger from the operation : but this important ritual is seldom neglected. It is deemed the outward mark of a true believer: and the very fear that his corpse might, in a day of slaughter, be confounded with those of infidels, and, in consequence, be denied the holy rites of sepulture, is sufficient to make every man, who professes the faith, anxious that this cere mony should be performed.

Mahomed early taught his disciples to believe that it was sent in a complete state from God to the lowest heaven by the hands of the angel Gabriel*, from whence it was communicated to him, in detached portionsf, by the same angel. From the first revelation to the last occupied a period of twenty-three years : and the Prophet of Arabia declared, that he held, during the whole of this time, a continual intercourse with Gabriel, and was wont to dictate to a writer the different chapters as that angel brought them to him. No mode could have been better calculated to preserve and to promote his power. He was at once the civil ruler and the military leader of his followers; and he drew at pleasure, from a source which they deemed divine, those laws and mandates which were to regulate their lives, and to excite them to actions of virtue and of valour. In order to guard against the errors of precipitation, he inculcated, as a doctrine, that the commands he received from the Almighty were sometimes re voked : and he also warned true believers against lilerally interpret ing all the passages in the Koran. Some parts of that volume were, he told them, to be understood as they were written; while others * This took place on a night which is termed the night of Ul-Kadr, or ' the ' night of power, or glory.' It is believed to be that between the twenty-third and twenty-fourth of Ramazan: but Mahomedan doctors are not further agreed respecting this date, than that it actually was during the month of Ramazan, the whole of which is deemed sacred, on account of the occurrence of this auspicious event. t The Koran was not even sent in chapters, but in small portions, several of which are often included in one chapter.•THM HISTORY OF PERSIA. 341 were to be taken in a figurative sense*. By these precautions he chap.xxii. was prepared to evade, if he could not directly repel, every charge of inconsistency, or of false prophecy. Mahomed was possessed of a graceful person, of ready eloquence, of courage, and of wisdom. In the state in which he found his country, the means taken by this extraordinary man to propagate his doctrine, and establish his power, could hardly fail of success: and even his enemies must admit, that he entitled himself to the gratitude of his countrymen. The great majority of the Arabians, when he first proclaimed his mission, were ignorant idolaters, whose superstition was disgraced by the grossest and most inhuman usages-f*. They were, as a nation, divided at home and despised abroad. By adopting his religion, they learnt to pay their exclusive adoration to one true and only God ; and they obtained a strength from that political union, which was the consequence of their common creed, that enabled them to become masters of the fairest portion of the globe. The Koran is written in the purest dialect of the Arabic, and is The composi- deemed, by Mahomedans, of such surpassing beauty and eloquence ranconsidered of composition, that they consider it impossible an uninspired human * The following passage in the Koran exemplifies its character in this respect: ' There is no God but he, the mighty, the wise.

It cannot be expected that others should view, either the language in which it is written, or its contents, with equal enthusiasm. It has been summarily described by an able European author* as containing a few ordinances relative to poly gamy, divorces, slavery, and the laws of succession ; some emphatical declamations on the attributes of God; and a collection of puerile tales and extravagant fables. But we can hardly (in the pride of better knowledge,) venture to pronounce that to be puerile or con temptible which has so fully answered the purpose for which it was designed, and which is still considered as the standard of truth and perfection by nearly half the universe. The Koran of Mahomed, with many of the defects ascribed to it, abounds with the finest passages in praise of the Almighty. Its author dwells upon the great and holy theme with an eloquence that is exalted by the most enraptured fervor. The other parts, though less eloquent, were suited to the character, prejudices, and habits of those to whom his religion was offered, and whose ignorant and degraded condition it was meant to improve. His success was astonishing: and even those who have shuddered at the magnitude of his presumptuous profanation, have accorded an admiration to the man which they refused to the prophet, and have not been able to consign to that contempt, which belongs to schemes of superstitious and idolatrous worship, a religion, which, with all its errors, is grounded upon one of the most rational and sublime principles of human belief. The purpose of the Koran, and the manner in which it was written, has rendered it a volume of law, as well as of religion. The Volney.m THE HISTORY OF PERSLA, 343 intention of its author was not only to instruct his followers in their chap.xxii. duty to God, but towards each other: and the precepts it contains have been acknowledged, throughout the nations who profess the Ma- homedan faith, as the sole foundation of all their jurisprudence. The different passages and chapters of the Koran were never put into any order by the prophet, and were, at his death, a confused heap of loose sheets. The important labour of forming them into a volume devolved upon the first caliph, Aboubeker, who arranged them, without any attention to the times at which the different revelations were made: but this was of no consequence, as each chapter is distinct, and has no necessary connexion with the one that precedes or follows it. The transcript made from the original sheets was committed to the custody of one of the widows of Mahomed ; but, some years afterwards, the caliph, Osman, discovering that many spurious editions of the sacred volume were dispersed over the empire, directed that a number of copies should be taken from the one which Aboubeker had made, and that they should be dis tributed to the faithful; who were commanded to burn and destroy all the other editions, as erroneous *. The spirit of division, which appeared among the followers of the Prophet of Arabia, even before his death, broke out with great violence on the occurrence of that event; and the rapid strides which his successors made to imperial power, only afforded this spirit a wider sphere of action. It would fill a volume even to name the various sects which have sprung up in the Mahomedan world. It is only meant to describe that of the Sheahs, which has become the Sale's Preliminary Discourse on the Koran, page 86.344 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap. xxii . national religion of Persia, and to notice the doctrines of the Sooffees, w hich have spread over that kingdom : but, before we enter upon this part of the subject, it will be necessary to say a few words on the progress of the Soonee faith; which, from the great majority in the numbers of those who have concurred in its belief, claims the dis tinction of being entitled the orthodox, or established religion. Anaccountof The Koran, considered as a book of law, was only suited to fakh. S00nee the government of a rude society, shaped like that of the Arabian tribes for whom it was first framed. When the power of the caliphs was extended, it became impossible to govern their numerous sub jects by the comparatively few rules and maxims which this volume contained ; and the difficulty was increased, by a great proportion of these rules of conduct being local, and altogether inapplicable to the condition of many of the nations who had embraced the Maho- medan religion. The fundamental principle, however, of this faith required, that, wherever it was introduced, all former usages and laws should be abolished; for it was deemed profanation to desire know ledge on such a subject from any other than a divine source. There appeared, therefore, no remedy, but rendering that more copious. An account of the actions, and the traditionary sayings of the pro phet, who was believed never to have acted or spoken but by the inspiration of God, and whose every act and word was, in conse quence, considered as a law, were collected from the mouths of his wives and companions. This immense collection was termed Sonna, and regarded by the Sconces or those who believed in it, * The Jews had also a code of traditions: and it was a saying with the Pharisee, (who may be termed the Jewish Soonee,) that the words of the Scribes were lovely,THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 345 as of equal authority with the Koran. But the materials for the chap.xxii, government of great empires were yet incomplete. Some part of the Koran was obscure and figurative: many of the traditions were vague, and still more contradictory of each other. To remedy the confusion and evils arising from these causes, the most learned and able of the Mahomedan divines devoted themselves to the explana tion of these holy records : but it was evidently impossible that they could limit themselves to the mere exposition of texts. They sought to acquire fame by the propagation of their own opinions, and by the addition of their dogmas to those of their prophet and his immediate successors. Schisms were multiplied in every quarter where the Mahomedan religion was professed: but the great mass of believers settled at last in recognising the authority of four eminent doctors of law, Haneefa, IVTalik, Shalfei, and Hanbalwho were considered as holy and learned men in their lives, and, since their deaths, have been canonized as the four Imaums* or high priests, of the established above the words of the law, and more weighty than the law and the prophets. The Apostle Matthew, in alluding to this doctrine, says, « Thus have ye made the « commandment of God of none effect by your traditions.'—-MartAe®, chap. xv. verse 6. # The sacred title of Imaum is, by the Sbeahs, given only to the immediate de scendants of the prophet, which are twelve. The last of these, the Imaum Mehdy, is supposed by them to be concealed (not dead), and the title which belongs to him can not, they conceive, be given to another: but among the Soonees it is a dogma, that there must be always a visible Imaum, or « father of the church.' The title is given to the four learned doctors who are the founders of their faith. It was long maintained that the Imaum must be descended from the Arabian tribe of Koreish: but the Emperors of Constantinople (who are of a Tartar family,) have assumed the sacred title, which they claim on the ground of the formal renunciation of it by Mahomed the Twelfth, the last vol. ii. 2 yTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap .xxn. orthodox religion. These saints differed from each other in expound- ing parts of the Koran, and the traditions; but their followers have concurred in tolerating their respective differences, which relate more to forms than essentials, and have become consolidated into one be lief, which is termed the Soonee, or, in other words, the belief of those who assent to the Soona, or oral traditions, and consequently acknow ledge the first caliphs, from whom most of these traditions were derived, as the chosen companions and legitimate successors of the prophet. The four sects mentioned above, have been denominated the four pillars of the Soonee faith: each has a separate oratory at the Temple of Mecca: but this, and the other distinctions they have preserved, as separate sects, have not disturbed their union, which has been cemented by their common alarm at the progress of schisms, that threatened, if they spread, not only to alter the faith, but to overthrow the whole system of their jurisprudence; which was esta blished upon authorities, the purity and legality of which these heretics openly denied. Ah account of Among the principal of these schisms was that of the Sheahs; sheahs^ which, as has been before stated, had become, from the commence ment of the Suffavean dynasty, the national religion of Persia. The meaning of the term Sheah has been already explained, and a short account has been given of the history of this sect. From the hour of the death of Mahomed, the adherents of Aly had maintained his right of succession to the caliphate, and had deemed those by whom that right had been set aside as the greatest of sinners.

The kingdom of Persia was the first whose inhabitants united in The inhabit- proclaiming themselves of this sect, and who vowed eternal hatred antsofPersia unite in pro- and war against those who professed the Soonee doctrine. More claimin g them - ' selves of the than three centuries* has elapsed since the Sheah faith has become Sheah faith - the adopted religion of that country: and, during the whole of that period, a regard for its tenets have either been the cause, or the pretext, of almost every war in which it has been engaged. Surrounded by nations who profess the Soonee doctrine, whether the Persian has been called upon to invade the territories of the Turks, the Affghans, or the Tartars, or to repel the attacks of these nations, he has been always summoned by the same watchword: and the belief that the Sheah faith was in danger, has never failed to rouse him to action. Nddir Shah, when at the summit of his power, at tempted to destroy a feeling, of which he had proved the efficacy for the purpose of defence, because it was likely (as it excited hatred in other nations,) to obstruct his ambitious plans of extended con quest : but the attempt failed, and the attachment of the Persians to * Ismail, the first king of the Suffavean race, ascended the throne of Persia in A. D. 1499, and proclaimed the Sheah faith to be the national religion of that country.348 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. The difference between the Soonee and Sheah doc trine. chap. xxii . their faith continues as decided as ever. It appears, therefore, of importance to understand the character of those feelings which have had, and continue to have, so powerful an influence upon a nation's conduct: and we cannot obtain this knowledge, except by a careful study of the tenets and dogmas which are peculiar to the Sheah sect of Mahomedans. The great and radical difference between the Soonee and Sheah doctrine, arises from the latter maintaining the divine and indefeasible right of Aly to have succeeded to the caliphate at the death of the prophet. His claims, they assert, rested on his being the first convert, and consequently the eldest in the faith; on his nearness of kindred to Mahomed, of whom he was a cousin; and on his having married Fatimah, the only offspring of that prophet; They also affirm, that he was expressly declared his successor*; and that those by whose intrigues he was deprived of his inheritance, acted in direct contradiction to the will of God, as signified through the prophet. The same great temporal and spiritual power, which the adherents of Aly conceive should have immediately descended to him, ought, in their opinion, to have been transmitted to his lineal descendants; and they, consequently, deem not only the three first caliphs, Aboubeker, Omar, and Osman, but all the caliphs who took the title of ' Lord of the Faithful,' as illegal usurpers of power. * Sheah writers declare, that when the angel Gabriel informed Mahomed he must prepare to die, that sacred personage proceeded towards Mecca. On the road became to a place called Khoom-e-Ghuddeer, where he declared Aly his heir. This event oc curred on the 18th of Zehadge, and is celebrated by an annual festival, called the Eed- ul-Ghuddeer ; or ' the festival of Ghuddeer.'THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 34 g This belief is hostile to the whole fabric of the establishment of the ciiarxxit.. Soona, or traditions of the Soonee sect; as those who profess it deny all that part of their traditions which rest upon the authority of the three first caliphs, whose very names are abhorrent to them. The Sheahs, however, admit the legality of the Soona, or traditions, except where the source from whence these are derived is contaminated by crime, or disobedience * to God. Their leading principle throughout, is an adherence to the relations and descendants of Mahomed, whom they deem to have partaken, though in a lesser degree, of his sacred nature: and the title that Sheahs love to be distin guished by, which is that of ' the friends of the family/' strongly marks this feeling. The Sheahs both disbelieve and contemn the dogmas of the four Their disbelief great Imaums or saints, who may be termed the founders of the of ^theTur Soonee doctrine. These learned doctors have, they affirm, propa- I^,aums • gated many erroneous and impious opinions, both in matters of faith and of practice: and they contend, that the worldly policy, which has led to the monstrous compound of their contradictory tenets into one faith, must involve all those who adopt it as a general belief in inexplicable difficulties. They argue, in support of this opinion, that as it is acknowledged there is only one path of truth, it becomes evident, that if the followers of Haneefa, or any other of the Soonee saints, are right, those of the remaining three sects must be wrong: and after all, they ask, ' Is it not better to trust to what we have ' received from God and his prophet, and from those who lived * They accuse the three first caliphs of direct disobedience, on the ground of their knowledge of Al/s superior right, and of the prophet's desire that he should be his successor.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. ' at the period of his mission, and have transmitted his sayings^ « than to give our minds over to these pretending doctors of divi- ' nity and of law*; and, by doing so, constitute their fallible works ' into the standard of our faith, and the rule of our livesf?' * The orientalists have ever been fond of illustrating arguments by anecdotes. They relate the following of a Sheah doctor of laws, who was summoned to attend a meeting, in which four doctors of the orthodox sects were assembled, to decide whether Saltan Khodah-bundah, the great grandson of Chenghiz, could be allowed to take back a wife whom he had divorced three times, without conforming to the prescribed usage, founded on the Soonee law, of her first marrying and cohabiting with another person. The Sheah doctor, with a pretended clownish manner, instead of leaving his slippers at the door of the room in which they assembled, secured them under his arm. This action produced much mirth ; and the reason of it was demanded. 'We have a ' record in my family,' said the man, ' that one of our ancestors, who lived in the ' days of our prophet, had his slippers stolen by a follower of Haneefa!' All burst into laughter; and he was informed, that Haneefa himself did not propagate his doctrine till a century after the prophet's death. ' It must have been a follower of Malik then.' The mirth became louder, as the ignorant doctor was instructed of the date of Malik, who came after Haneefa. ' Then it was Shaffeibut he was of still later date. ' It ' must,' said the Sheah, in an affected rage, ' have been Hanbal!' This holy man, he was informed, did not publish his works till the second century of the Hejirah. The Sheah doctor started back with affected surprise at all this information, and exclaimed: (( Why, if all you say is true, these holy saints, whose opinions you desire ' to make our laws, lived so long after our prophet, that they could personally know ' no more than you and 1, gentlemen, except as they might happen to be more or less ' learned !' Saying this, he arose and took his departure; but was soon sent for by the king, who asked him if he thought he might take back his wife without first allowing her to be married to another? ' If there is no greater authority than the opinion of ' these modern saints against it, I can see no sin in your doing so,' was the reply. The king was rejoiced, and immediately acted on his opinion: and this circumstance is supposed to have had no slight weight in disposing Mahomed Khodah-bund&amp;h to believe in the Sheah doctrines. — Persian MS. f Persian MS.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 351 The difference which exists in these points between the Soonee chap.xxii. and the Sheah sects is at once rancorous and irreconcileable. It is one in which the passions are easily arrayed; for it relates to no speculative or abstruse points of faith that are difficult to be com prehended, but is interwoven with the history of their general reli gion. Names which are never mentioned but with blessings by one sect, are hourly cursed by the other. The hypocrisy, ingratitude, and disobedience, of the three first caliphs are the essential dogmas of the Sheah doctrine: while the leading principle of the Soonees is, that, next to the prophet, these rulers were beyond all others the most entitled to the regard and veneration of posterity. It is evi dent, therefore, that the Soonee and Sheah faith can never exist in any concord with each other. A stranger to the name of Mahomed is more acceptable to a zealous man of either of these religions than the opposite sectary, who insults him with an hourly attack of his favourite tenets; and their disagreement, as has been before stated, relates to matters of faith, or rather opinion, more than of practice. The differences in their mode of worship and customs are slight*, and have wholly arisen out of the hate they bear each other, and their dislike to have any usage in common. Innumerable volumes have been written on the subject of the disputes between the Sheah and Soonee sects. Their effect has been similar to that of most works on religious controversy : they have oftener irritated than convinced: but it is justice to their authors to observe, that these productions frequently display an union of • * These consist in the mode of holding the hands, of the mode of prostration, and other forms equally immaterial.352 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap. xxii. taste and of learning. Every effort is made in them to arrest the attention of the reader. The arguments are often shaped into a dramatic form to render them more attractive : and the zealous writer condescends to amuse the fancy, in the hope that his doing so may aid his object of informing the judgment. It has been before observed, that the religion and the laws of a Mahomedan nation always flow from the same fountain; and the consequence is, that they regard, with feelings of sacred venera tion, all those by whom their laws are made or expounded. These must, generally speaking, be acknowledged as saints before they are recognised as lawgivers; and an attack upon the sanctity of their character, strikes at once at the faith and the jurisprudence of the countries where their authority is acknowledged. It has ever been one of the greatest disputes between the Soonees and Sheahs, that the latter deny all respect and confidence to the four great law givers on whom the whole superstructure of the usages and ordi nances, if not the religion, of the former depends. It will elucidate this subject to state some of the objections which they make to the dogmas of these reputed saints.

They assert, that among other deviations from the true path, he departed from the obvious text of the Koran, in allowing his followers to drink wine*, after its spirit had been a little evaporated by boiling; and that he also altered a number of practices regarding prayer and purifications, which are inculcated both in that volume and the admitted traditions. As a proof of the ignorance of this Imaum, the Sheah writerf, with apparent triumph, alleges, that he confessed his inability to decide whether a hermaphrodite could be admitted into paradise, or a geni become perceptible to the human vision! The second, Imaum Malik, was also born J in the first century Of Malik, of the Hejirah ; and, if we are to believe Soonee writers, he was not less remarkable than Haneefa for his modesty and piety.

When urged by his friends to take this station to escape persecution, he replied, « I choose rather to be punished by men than by God and when asked the reason why he said he was unfit for it, he answered, ' If I have spoken the truth, I am unfit; ' i f I have uttered a falsehood, a liar is not fit to be a judge.'— S ale's Freliminary Discourse on the Koran, page 206. * I follow, in this part, the author of the Absar-ul-Mustubsureen, or « The Eyes of ' Acute Observersa work of considerable reputation. This writer accuses Haneefa of allowing his disciples to drink nuheez; a kind of wine made from dates or raisins; which, he asserts, is in direct opposition to that sacred tradition which states, ' that ' every thing that intoxicates is wine,' and that ' every wine is unlawful.'— Mustubsureen. t Absar-ul-Mustubsureen. t The Imaum Abdool Malik was born between the year of the Hejirah ninety and ninety-five, and died A.

This Imaum appears to have been bolder than any of his prede cessors, and to have taught doctrines which subjected him to the most cruel persecution. The Sheahs accuse him, not only of having allowed his followers to relieve occasional lowness of spirits by the use of intoxicating drugs ||, but of propagating the most profane doctrines regarding the nature of the Almighty, whom his followers, they assert, were taught to believe was a corporeal being.

I have not permitted it to heal, that I might ' show it you; and that you should know, that, if the God you ' adore sustained so great a wrong from a being whom he created, ' you should not be surprised at the sufferings your sons endured ' from their own tribe/' The followers of this doctor, the same writer observes, assert, 66 that the Almighty had one day a pain ' i 11 and that he informed the inquiring angels that it was ' an inflammation, brought on by the torrents of tears which he ' had shed at the deluge:' and they also affirm, ' that every ' Thursday night God assumes the shape of a beautiful boy, and * According to Mahomedan legends, Nimrod pretended to divine power, and shot an arrow at the heavens to kill the Almighty. i* The author of the Absar-ul-Mustuhsureen states, that he takes this fact from the Mouakiff, a work which he asserts is held in high estimation by the sect of Hanballee.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA.

The impious tenets which are here charged upon the disciples of Hanbal, should properly be ascribed to those of the Ebn-ul-Keram, the celebrated founder of the schism of the Keramites; a sect which, by their literal acceptation of the figurative parts of the Koran, have been led into a gross heresy, that is deemed at once monstrous and blasphemous by almost all other Mahomedans, who, generally speak- ing, entertain the purest and most sublime belief of the divine nature and attributes of the Almighty. The Sheahs also accuse the four Soonee Imaums of having altered several sacred institutions, particularly that of the division of the khums*, or fifth share of spoil taken in war; regarding which, * The khums is described in the Koran as the property of God, his prophet, and his relations, or men of his tribe, (Benee Haschim,) who are poor and destitute. The light of the Benee Haschim to a share in the khums is grounded upon their being excluded from any portion of the zukaat. The author of the Ubsar-ul-Mus- tubsureen expressly states, that when « the one fifth of the whole of the captured pro- ' perty had been separated, Mahomed divided it into six portions; three of which ' the prophet took for himself, and the three remaining he divided equally among ' orphans, beggars, and travellers, of the tribe of Benee Haschim, to compensate them358 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. ciiap.xxil they affirm, they have established doctrines at complete variance w it[ 1 the practice of Mahomed and the text of the Koran. They also assert, that they have altered forms of prayer, and made devia tions on other points from what is enjoined by traditions of acknow ledged authority, for the express and sole object of establishing usages* opposite to those of the Sheahs ; and on all these grounds they hold the names of Haneefa, Malik, ShafFei, and Hanbal, in complete abhorrence, and consider as wanderers from the true path all who follow their abominable and heretical doctrines. It would be tedious to enter into a methodical disquisition of the innumerable points of difference between these two Maho- medan sects: a short reference to some of their most popular productions will be the best mode of elucidating the character of their opposite tenets, and of showing the style of their most esteemed theological disputants.

' for the religious charity (zukaat), in which, by the Koran, it was considered unlawful ' for them to share.' It is one of the most serious charges which the Sheah writers make against the three first caliphs, that they altered this usage, and took the whole of the khums to themselves, to the exclusion of the sacred family, and the tribe of the prophet: but we find it stated in a learned work on Mahomedan law, that, according to the Soonees, shares of the khums should be given to orphans, the poor, and travellers.— Commentary on Mahomedan lazv, Vol, II. page 179. # The Soonees are accused of making the tops of graves convex instead of flat, (the shape ordered by a tradition,) for no reason but opposition to the Sheahs. — Absar-ut- Mustubsureen.

They are accused of not only denying the authority, but of vilifying the character of those who are declared in the Koran to be the chosen companions of the holy prophet. They are reminded, that even Aly, the Lord of the Faithful, whose undaunted valour was never questioned, submitted to the rule of the three first caliphs; and that these cannot be accused of usurpation, without implicating him in an act of base submission to illegal authority. The Sheahs are upbraided in this letter* with the calumnies they have uttered against Ayesha, and are accused of having dishonoured the sacred name of the prophet by their abuse of his wife. They are, on the ground of these, and many other heresies, denounced, by the writers of this anathema, as the worst of infidels. ' Your pro- ' perty,' these observe, ' is legitimate plunder for those who 44 fight for the true faith : and as to the fields and gardens in the ' vicinity of Mushed, which, you inform usf, are the unalienable sc property of the holy shrine of the Imaum Rezd, to which sacred ' purpose they were consecrated by the ancestors of the present ' Monarchs of Persia, we can only reply, that, in a country which it ' is proper and lawful to plunder, the army of the faithful cannot ' stop to distinguish the lands which have been appropriated for * Letter of the oulimah, or religious men, of Maver-ul-Naher to the Sheahs of Mushed, t There would appear, from this remark', to have been some previous correspond ence ; but I have never seen any letter except this, and the reply to it.360 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap.xxii .

The pro phet, enraged at these words, and at their disputes, commanded them to leave him. He adduces other acts of disobedience in the three first caliphs; and concludes, on the authority of that verse of the Koran which states, ' He who obeys not the person I have ' sent, is an infidel,' that they were infidels, and ought to have been excluded, on that ground alone, (even if they had possessed legal claims,) from succeeding to the high dignity of the caliphate. The writer of this letter denies the truth of that tradition which has been brought forward to prove that Mahomed praised the caliphs; but observes, that, if admitted, it proves nothing; for that his praise could only have had relation to their past lives, and can never, therefore, be used as a shield to cover those errors and crimes* which they subsequently committed. He ridicules the importance which the Soonee divines have given to the term companion, which Mahomed used to Aboubeker when he was concealed with him in the cave. ' The obvious signification of the word is,' he observes, ' the best refutation of such an argument. It merely means the person ' that is with another, and has no relation to their virtue or religion :' and to prove this, he asserts, that ' the most learned commentators ' have declared, that the prophet, on this occasion, quoted the very ♦ The author does not deny that the prophet might have had prescience of their guilt: but this, he states, gave him no power to prevent it.

' expression * used by Joseph when he was imprisoned in Egypt: and ' the companions/^ he adds, ' who were addressed by the son of ' Jacob, were both idolaters/' In answer to the accusation that Aly, by submitting to the eleva tion of the other caliphs, has acknowledged their right, he replies, « that the number of followers they had collected, and the measures &lt;e which they had adopted while Aly was occupied with the obsequies ' of the prophet, made it impossible for him to assert his right, without ' a civil war; which, whatever had been its issue, would have caused ' great bloodshed. This forbearance, &gt;, he adds, ' can never be « adduced as an argument against his right; for Aly, though brave, ' was certainly exceeded in courage by his uncle, Mahomed; whoy ' when surrounded by the first heroes of the faithful, fled before the ' infidels of the tribe of Koreish, and, after a long period, was ' rejoiced to obtain a truce: yet this event never led to a conclusion ' that the Koreish were right, or that the prophet, by making peace ' with them, admitted them to be so. But it is evident/' says our author, ' that God himself has often shown forbearance towards ' infirm mortals, who have aspired to his throne : and if the ' Almighty/' he concludes, ' clothed in all his power, has, for ' inscrutable causes, acted in this manner to the wicked, who shall a dare to arraign the conduct of Moortez4 Aly upon this occasion ?

But they refuse that respect for the wives which they claim for the daughter of Mahomed, and justify the abuse of Ayesha, with which the Soonees charge them, by urging, that she not only joined Mo&amp;veah in making war upon Aly, whom she knew to be the appointed successor* of her husband, but departed, by appearing at the head of an army, from the law which the prophet had laid down, regarding that privacy in which it was the duty of the female sex to live. The author here followed, supports this latter accusation against Ayesha, by asserting, that it is written in one of the most authentic books of tradition, that when a blind man f was sitting with the prophet, one of his wives passed through the room. The lady, on being reproved, observed, that the man was blind. ' But thou seest,' was the answer of Mahomed; which, to those who belieye in this tradition, is received as a law, which prohibits a female from gazing on the form of any man but her husband, or nearest male kindred. The same writer repels the attack made upon his sect, of including the sacred cha racter of the prophet in the reproaches they have thrown upon Ayesha J. ' If you were to establish,' he tells his opponents, ' a # All Sheah authors assume, that Mahomed positively declared, on one occasion, his desire that Aly should be his successor. f His name was Omah Mukhtoom.

The Sheahs had, in a prior communication, claimed some con sideration, on the ground of their being admitted to perform the pilgrimage to Mecca, and associating, when there, with wise and pious men. To this their enemies had replied, in the words of the poet Jami*, ' He who has not good in his heart can derive no benefit from ' looking upon the countenance of the prophet/' An inaccuracy in this quotation gave Moollah Mahomed an advantage, which he seized with all the skill of an able disputant. ' I certainly expected/' he observes, ' that men who have, or ought to have, read the Koran, ' and all the commentaries upon that sacred volume, could have ' copied a Persian stanza without a mistake; but you have altered ' and rendered ungrammatical the words of the poet : no ' doubt conceiving, that after you had plundered and defaced his ' native province, it was but a trifling additional injury to spoil one ' of the beautiful lines of the celebrated Jami. This,' he concludes, ' my red-cheeked! art thou yet satisfied with the show ?' She replied, * No.' This ' story,' the indignant Sheah author adds, ' which you relate of Mahomed, would not ' be believed if told of the most depraved of men; and, indeed, its enormity appears ' beyond all comment.' * The poet Jami, who takes his name from the village of Jam, near Herat, where he was born, was not more famous for his fancy and skill as a poet, than for his learning and sanctity as a divine. His poems (many of which are very beautiful) breathe, in every line, the most sacred rapture; and hence they are oftener quoted by the writers on theology than those of any other poet.. ^ the history of persia. 3 g 5 ' may appear a light remark, but it may be useful in teaching you chap.xxit. ' not to t&gt; e precipitate in forming a judgment on what you do not guilty ' thoroughly understand A number of proofs are brought forward by this writer to establish some(l su P eriorit y of the Sheah faith ; but he concludes by stating, that if those who believe in this faith are wrong, that is no cause why they should be doomed to destruction. ' What knowledge,' he demands of his antagonists, ' can you have of the inward thoughts of ' those on whom you have pronounced so dreadful a sentence? ' The passions of kings are as a consuming flame, on which it ' behoves wise and good men to pour the water of moderate ' councils: but the anathema you have promulgated is, in the ' hands of the soldier, the pretext for every excess and violence.

Among the works which have been written on the subject of the difference between the Soonee and Sheah sects, the latter esteem none more than a small tract, called Hussunneah, composed by one of their most learned divines; who, to mark his contempt for his adversaries, has made a female slave, whose name he has given to his work, the successful champion of the tenets of his faith, in a public dispute, supposed to have been held before the celebrated caliph, Haroun-ul-Rusheed.

The learned author^ informs us, ' that a merchant at Bagdad, ' when reduced to poverty from the persecution he had suffered ' on account of his religious persuasion, applied to a favourite and 64 accomplished female slave to .know what he should do to save ' himself from utter ruin. This lady, whose name was Hussunneah,, ' or 4 the beautiful/ and who had been carefully educated in the ' principles of the Sheah sect, in the house of the holy Imaum ' Jaffier-f*, advised her master to go to the palace of Haroun-ul- ' Rusheed and offer her for sale. 4 Demand/ said she, 4 a hundred 44 thousand pieces of gold J : and if the caliph should ask why you 44 put this immoderate value upon your slave, tell him to assemble 44 his ablest disputants on points of theology, and say confidently 44 that she will refute them all/ The merchant replied, 4 I can 44 never consent to this plan : the bigoted tyrant H will be en- # Shaikh Abool Futtovah. t Jaffier was the sixth Imaura.

The merchant returned to Haroun, and ' agreed to his terms: on which the caliph immediately sent for ' Hussunneah, and asked her what faith she professed? ' I profess ' the faith of the prophet and his descendants/ said she, 4 thanks ' be to God'/ Haroun next asked who she considered to be the ' proper successor of the prophet?

About ' four hundred obeyed this summons; among whom, Ibrahim Nizam, ' of Bussorah, was deemed the first in sanctity and in knowledge.

So they both went on by ' the sea-shore, until they went up into a ship : and he made a hole therein. And ' Moses said unto him,' Hast thou made a hole therein that thou mightest drown those ' who are on board? Now hast thou done a strange thing.' He answered, * Did I not ' tell thee that thou couldest not bear with me?' Moses said, * Rebuke me not, because I ' did forget; and impose not on me a difficulty in what I am commanded.' Wherefore ' they left the ship, and proceeded until they met with a youth, and he slew him. ' Moses said,' Hast thpu slain an innocent person, without his having killed another ? ' Now hast thou committed an unjust action.' He answered, * Did I not tell thee that ' thou couldest not bear with me ?' Moses said, ' If I ask thee concerning any thing ' hereafter, suffer me not to accompany thee: now hast thou received an excuse from ' me.' They went forward, therefore, until they came to the inhabitants of a certain ' city, and they asked food of the inhabitants thereof; but they refused to receive ' them. And they found therein a wall, which was ready to fall down ; and he set it ' upright. Whereupon Moses said unto him,' If thou wouldest thou mightest doubt- ' less have received a reward for it.'

He, however, secretly advised this heroine of the Sheah faith to leave Bagdad, lest some misfortune should happen to her. The lady left the assembly in triumph ; and, independent of the presents she received from Haroun, many were bestowed upon her by princes of the blood, and other great persons. Ibrahim Nizam, the author informs us, came down from his golden chair quite ashamed, and retired with Abou Yusoof, Shaffei, and some others of the enemies of the Sheahs: the people laughed at them; and a cousin of Haroun was particularly witty at their expense. But, notwithstanding this ap probation, Hussunneah and the merchant, fearful of the effects of the victory she had obtained, departed from the city, as the caliph had advised, and took up their abode at Medinah. The Persian author of this work says, that when he was returning from Mecca he stopped at Damascus, and obtained from a Syud of Syria the Arabic manuscript which he has translated. The name of the translator is not given. The probability is, that the book was first written in Persian ; and it is ascribed to Shaikh Abool Futtovah, of Rhe, a very eminent and zealous divine of the Sheah sect. According to the doctrine of the Sheahs, a man may, under cir cumstances of danger, not only conceal his faith, but make a temporary profession of contrary sentiments. The adoption of this unmanly tenet has been originally forced upon this sect, inconse quence of the oppressed and persecuted state in which they so longTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. ^ remained : and the pride of the Persians has brooked its continuance chap.xxii. rather than abandon the pilgrimage to Mecca, which they cannot perform without testifying, as they visit the tombs of the first caliphs, a respect for their memory which is contrary to their belief. The strictness with which the Soonee possessors of Mecca have continued to enforce these concessions, have greatly diminished the number of pilgrims from Persia; the mass of the population of that country being satisfied with a pilgrimage to the sepulchre of Aly and his sons Hussein and Hussun, whose remains are deposited at Nujuif and Kerbelah, which are situated in the province of Bagdad; or to that of the Imaum Rez^, at Mushed, in Khorassan. The sepulchres of these saints of Sheah worship have been enriched with the most magnificent presents by pious devotees: monarchs have emulated each other in adding to their revenue, and in increasing the splendor of their appearance. In the mode of worship observed at these shrines, as at Mecca, many ceremonies have been introduced that border upon a superstition, which is remote from that principle of pure Deism upon which the Mahomedan religion is professedly grounded. But the followers of the Prophet of Arabia have relaxed from the primitive principles of their religion, and have granted a species of adoration * It is not a duty of the Sheahs to curse the first caliphs ; but this reserve is more from prudence than feeling. When they hear them execrated, they never pass a heavier censure on the individual who does it, than to blame his indiscreet zeal. Omar is the particular object of their hatred. This probably proceeds from the great charac ter of that caliph. I was one day conversing with a very sensible and moderate Persian upon the history of Omar, and praising him as the greatest of all the caliphs. He assented to all the facts I stated, but said, Een hunmah rast est laiken aukher sag-hood; 41 This is all true, but he was a dog after all.'

The feelings of gratitude and veneration which the conduct of individuals * first created, has grown, by excessive indulgence, and by the ardour of passions excited by contrary opinions,—into sacred reverence and devotion. Their very garments have become relicsf of inestimable value; and in the course of time the same properties have been assigned to them as are supposed to have belonged to their possessors. From this common progress of super stition hardly one of the numerous sects into which the Mahomedan religion is divided can be deemed exempt J. The Sheahs not only * The incredible veneration paid to the early martyrs and confessors, by their pious contemporaries, was the cause of many evils in the Christian Church. f There are relics which are deemed sacred at almost every shrine, particularly at that of Aly, at Nujuff. J The modern sect of Wahcibee pretend that they are an exception to this observa tion. This sect was founded near a century ago, by an Arab of the name of Shaikh Mahomed, the son of Abdool W&amp;M,b, whose name they have taken. Shaikh Mahomed connected himself in the attempt to reform the religion of his country with Ebn-Saoud, the Prince of Dereah, the capital of the Province of Nujuddee. Through the efforts of the saint, and the aid of the temporal power of Ebn-Saoud, and his son and succes sor Abdool Azeez, the religion of the W&amp;Mbees is now established all over the penin sula of Arabia. The tenets of this sect are peculiar, and merit notice. They profess that there is one God, and Mahomed is his prophet: but as the Supreme Being neither has nor can have any participator in his power, they say, that to profess that either Mahomed, the Imaums, or any saints, can have any superintendance over the affairs of men, or render them any aid hereafter, is blasphemy. They deem Mahomedans who deviate in any way from the plain, literal meaning of the Koran, infidels; and main tain, that to make war upon all such is the imperious duty of every WaMbee. It is one of their tenets, that all titles meant to show respect and honour to men are odiousTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. ■ 0a ^ ^ 35 sail, NlCtjf 379 pay this species of devotion at the principal shrines that have been chap.xxil mentioned, but have an immense number of inferior saints and martyrs, at whose tombs they offer up their prayers. Every village in Persia Can boast of some shaikh or holy person, whose character has obtained him a local reputation that has rendered his shrine sacred among the few acquainted with his name. to God, who alone is worthy of high name: and they assert, that in conformity to what is revealed in the Koran, true Mahomedans should wage continual war against unbelievers, till they are converted, or agree to pay the tribute imposed on infidels; and that in the latter case they should be compelled to wear the coarsest garments, not be allowed to ride on horses, nor to live in splendid dwellings. They maintain, that the taxes (including zukaat and khums) levied by Mahomed are alone lawful: that swearing by Mahomed or Aly, or any person, should be prohibited, since an oath is calling a witness to our secret thoughts, which no one can know but God. They deem it a species of idolatry to erect magnificent tombs; but to kiss relics, &amp;c. is idolatry itself; and therefore, they affirm, that it is an action acceptable to God to destroy the tombs of Mahomedan saints in Arabia and Persia, and to appropriate their rich ornaments to worldly purposes, for which they were designed. They say, that it is wicked to mourn for the dead, for if they were good Mahomedans their souls are in paradise, at which their friends should rejoice. The Wahabees reject the whole of the tradi tions, limiting their belief to the Koran, which was, they say, sent from heaven to Mahomed, who was an excellent man, and much beloved of God. They continue to preserve the usages of circumcision, ablution, &amp;c. which they found established, but consider them more as matters of practice and usage than of faith. The leading principle of this sect is their right to destroy and plunder all who differ from them: and those Mahomedans who do not adopt their creed are represented as far less entitled to mercy than either Jews or Christians. Their progress was so great about ten years ago, as to excite considerable alarm in the Turkish government. Among other places, they plundered the rich tombs of Aly and his sons at Nujuff and Kerbelah. Their inroads are always dreadful, for they spare none who do not conform to their opinions ; but they have lately met with some severe checks, and appear to be declining.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. The Sheahs observe the same feasts as the Soonees; but the former have set aside the ten first days of the month of Mohur- rum to mourn over the cruel fate of Hussein and Hussun, the sons of Aly. On the last days of this feast they beat their breasts with violence; and, calling on the names of the two martyrs, they pour curses on the heads of their enemies. It is during this cere mony that the lower order of the Sheahs give offence to the Soonees, by publicly cursing the three first caliphs, and particularly Omar. The Sheahs also observe a feast* on the day upon which, accord ing to their traditions, Mahomed named Aly his successor; an occur rence which the Soonees deny. It has been before stated, that the Persians refuse their assent to many of the traditions admitted by the Soonees; and the latter also reject many which their opponents deem authentic, as these traditions not only relate to the faith, but the form of prayer, and to the usages and laws of those who believe in them. There are several points of practice, both in religious worship and civil usages, in which these sects differ widely from each other. They neither agree in the manner of performing their ablutions, nor in the mode of holding their hands when at prayer. They also differ in the law of divorce: and the Persians admit a legal concubinage, by which the parties are united for a limited period ; a practice that is deemed, by the Soonees, a great profanation of the divine law. It would, however, be endless to describe the minute differences which exist between * The Persians also observe the twentieth of Suffer in commemoration of the burial of the Imaum Hussein's head at Kerbelah. It had been cut off when he was slain, and carried to Moiiveah at Damascus; but was brought back to Kerbelah ; and buried, forty days after the death of the Imaura.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 581 these two sects. All those that are essential have been noticed; and chap.xxii. more is not necessary to convey a full idea of their opposite and irreconcileable nature. It has already been observed, that the establishment of the Sheah faith as the national religion of Persia, gave to a country, in which patriotism was unknown, a principle of union, of equal, if not greater force. The Persians, however, are not so violent at present as they once were in their religious prejudices*: they deem their Soonee neighbours as lost in error, but they do not term them infidels. « They ' are believersf,^ they say, ' because they recognise the holy mission ' of Mahomed, and worship God; but they have forfeited their ' claim,' they add, ' to be denominated faithful J, by their adoption ' of those who refused allegiance, and acted with cruelty towards the ' nephew, the daughter, and the lineal descendants, of the holy pro- phet' The Soonees are not so charitable in their sentiments of the Sheah sect: and though some of their ablest divines || have de clared that the Sheahs, though deluded, were still Mahomedans, almost all Soonee monarchs have been led, by a mixture of religious and political motives, to treat them as a race of heretics that were worse than infidels; and, upon this ground, the most pious of the rulers of Bokharah§ have considered themselves entitled to make * This change is not to be ascribed, as has been supposed, to the progress of civilisation, but to the decrease of that fervor which attended the first introduction of the Sheah faith as the national religion of Persia. t The term Moslem signifies believer. $ Mouemen signifies faithful.

The blasphemous tenets of the sect of Ali-ilahyahs *, or those who deem Aly to be a divinity f, have been attributed, by their enemies, to the Sheahs, who entertain a just abhorrence of the principles of this sect, whose numbers are not great, and who endeavour to conceal their usages, (some of which are said to be of an obscene nature,) under a veil of mystery. In a chapter upon the religion of Persia it is impossible to pass over the Sooffees. That extraordinary class of devotees have been before noticed; but they claim a fuller description. We discover, from the evidence of Mahomedan authors, that these enthusiasts were co-existent with their religion. Their rapturous zeal, perhaps, aided in no slight degree its first establishment; but they have since been considered among the most dangerous of its enemies. There can be no doubt that their free opinions regarding its dogmas, their con tempt of its forms, and their claim to a distinct communion with the not hesitate to make his Sheah captives slaves ; and he is reproached by Aga Mahomed Khan with allowing true believers to be sold like beasts in the market-place of his capital. The savage Turkoman tribes, who made inroads into that country, followed the example of this prince, but from very different motives than those of religion. I one day asked a man of these tribes on what ground they made their Persian captives slaves ? ' Because,' said he, ' they are heretic Sheahs.'—' But suppose,' I added, « those you took were Soonees.'—' Then,' replied he very coolly, ' we must turn ' Sheahs, for slaves we must have.' * For a description of this sect, see Mr. H.

There is no country over which the tenets of the SoofFees have, at different periods, been more widely diffused than Persia. The great reputa tion acquired by one of their priests, enabled his descendants to occupy the throne of that kingdom for more than two centuries* : but the monarchs of the Suffavean dynasty were too sensible of the aid which their power derived from the continuance of an established and understood religion, to indulge in the rapt and visionary dreams of their pious ancestors. Their country, however, continued to abound with persons who believed in the tenets which these had taught; and the increase of their numbers has been, of late years, so great in Persia, that the Mahomedan divines of that nation have called upon the reigning king to defend the true faith from the attacks of several popular teachers; who, from the sanctity of their lives, and the delusive character of their doctrines, had acquired an alarming popularity. The monarch has, in consequence, adopted the most rigorous proceedings; and his severity has, for the moment, repressed a flame, which it would appear more calculated to increase than to extinguish. It would be vain to attempt to give a full history of the Sooffee doctrine; traces of which exist, in some shape or other, in every region of the world. It is to be found in the most splendid theories of the ancient schools of Greece, and in those of the modern philoso phers of Europe. It is the dream of the most ignorant, and of the * Ismail the First ascended the throne of Persia in A. D. 1500, and his family was subverted by Nadir Shah, A.

It every where pro fesses to be adverse to error and superstition, but exists by the active propagation of both. The wild and varied doctrines of their teachers are offered to the disciples of this sect, in the place of the forms and usages of their religion. They are invited to embark on the sea of doubt, under the guidance of a sacred teacher, whom they are required to deem superior to all other mortals, and worthy of a holy confi dence that borders upon adoration. It is in India, beyond all other climes, that this delusive and visionary doctrine has most flourished. There is, in the habits^ of that nation, and in the character of the Hindoo religion, what peculiarly cherishes that mysterious spirit of holy abstraction in which it is founded : and we may grant our belief to the conjecture which assumes, that India is the source from whence other nations have derived this mystic worship of the Divinity. The general name which the Persian followers of this sect have adopted, is Sooffee-f; a term which implies pure : and by this all * The same remark is applied by our ecclesiastical writers to Egypt; to which country they trace the mystic, the hermit, and the monk. These writers speak of the propensity to an austere life as a disease in Syria and Egypt. The Arabic term Sooffee, which means ' wise, pious,' and metaphorically used to denote a religious man, is supposed to be derived from the term Saaf, ' pure, clean or Suffd, which signifies ' purity.' Some have traced it to Soof, ' wool,' or &lt;£ wool- ' bearing,' in allusion to the coarse woollen garments usually worn by its teachers. It is worthy of remark, however, that these terms are all from the Arabic, and that the accounts we have of the Sooffees are comparatively of a modern date, being all subsequent to the conquest of Persia by the Caliph Omar, It is not very unlikely, therefore, that this name has been originally adopted from the Greek term Xoipoi (Sophoi), wise men.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 385 ranks who adopt this creed are known, from the revered teacher, who chap.xxii. is followed by thousands of disciples, to the humblest derveish, or fakeer, who travels about naked, and begs alms to support him in that life of prayer which he has voluntarily adopted *. The Sooffees represent themselves as entirely devoted to the search of truth, and as incessantly occupied in the adoration of the Almighty, an union with whom they desire with all the ardour of divine love. The great Creator is, according to their belief, diffused over all his creation f. He exists every where, and in every thing. # A life of mendicity, which many adopt from motives of piety, is assumed by others, whose fortunes are desperate, as a means of livelihood. It is related, that a man came to Mahomed, and exclaimed, ' O prophet! I am poor.'—' Poverty is my ' glory,' replied Mahomed. Another person came afterwards, and used exactly the same phrase: but Mahomed said to him, « Poverty causes men to blush in both ' worlds. You wonder,' said the prophet to his companions, ' at the apparent incon- ' sistency of my answers to two men seemingly of the same condition : but the first ' of these men is virtuous, and has, from principle, abandoned the world; but the se- ' cond fellow has no such merit, the world has abandoned Moumenan. t It is difficult to understand what the Sooffees state to be their opinion regarding matter. Some of these term the world alum kheal, i. e. ' a world of delusion by which it is implied, that we are constantly, with regard to all maddah, or ' matter,' under an illusion of our senses, and that it exists only from the light of God, or the animating principle which enables us to see it, and makes it visible, otherwise it is in itself nothing. ' The creation,' they say, ' proceeded at once from the splendour of God, ' who poured his spirit on the universe as the general diffusion of light is poured over ' th e earth by the rising sun ; and as the absence of that luminary creates total dark- ' ness, so the partial or the total absence of the divine splendour, or light, causes par- ' tia l or general annihilation.' They compare all the creation, in its relation to the Creator, to those small particles that are discernible to the eye in the rays of the sun, which are gone the moment that planet ceases to shine. — Persian MS. vol. ii. 3 dThe four stages to their attainment of divine beati tude. THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. They compare the emanations of his divine essence, or spirit, to the rays of the sun; which are, they conceive, continually darted forth, and reabsorbed. It is for this reabsorption in the divine essence, to which their immortal part belongs, that they continually sigh. They believe that the soul of man, and that the principle of life, which exists throughout all nature, is not from God, but of God; and hence those doctrines which their adversaries have held to be the most profane, as they were calculated to establish a degree of equality of nature between the created and the Creator. The Sooffee doctrine teaches that there are four stages through which man must pass before he can reach the highest, or that of divine beatitude; when, to use their own language, ' his corporeal veil* will ' be removed, and his emancipated soul will mix again with the ' glorious essence, from which it had been separated, but not divided/' The first of these stages is that of humanity-f, which supposes the disciple to live in an obedience to the holy law J, and an observance of all the rites, customs, and precepts of the established religion; which are admitted to be useful in regulating the lives, and restrain ing within proper bounds the vulgar mass, whose souls cannot reach the heights of divine contemplation, and who might be corrupted and misled by that very liberty of faith which tends to enlighten and delight those of superior intellect, or more fervent devotion ||.

He may now abandon all observance of religious forms and ceremonies, as he exchanges, to use their own phrase, ' practical for spiritual worship}:' but this stage cannot be obtained without great piety, virtue, and fortitude; for the mind cannot be trusted in the neglect of usages and rites, neces sary to restrain it when weak, till it has acquired strength from habits of mental devotion, grounded on a proper knowledge of its own dignity, and of the divine nature of the Almighty. The third stage is that of knowledge ||; and the disciple who arrives at it is deemed to have attained supernatural knowledge; or, in other words, to be inspired : and he is supposed, when he reaches this state, to be equal to the angels. The fourth and last stage is that which denotes his arrival at truth §; which implies his complete union f with the Divinity. The Sooffees are divided into innumerable sects, as must be the case in a doctrine which may be termed the belief of the imagi nation. By enumerating a few of the most remarkable of these sects, the character of the whole will be understood : for though they differ in name, and some minor usages, they are all agreed in the * Jubroot ' t Turreekat. t The term used to express practical worship is Jusmanee Amul, which may be translated ' the acts of the body.'

Authors are divided whether there are two or seven of what can be deemed original sects among the Sooffees: but a very learned writer*, whose hostile bigotry made him direct all his ability to explain and confute the doctrines of the Sooffees, after enumerating the seven-f* that are supposed to be original, states Ms opinion, that there are but two entitled to that distinction. These are called the Huloole^h, or ' the inspired,' and the It&amp;hede&amp;h, or ' the unionists/' He deems the other five sects, which have been considered by many as original, to be only branches from these two. The principle * i \ga Mahomed Aly, the late Mooshtahed, or high priest, of Kermanshah. I was well acquainted with this learned Persian, who enjoyed, when I was in Persia in 1800, the highest respect and confidence of the king. He was a man of considerable infor mation : and there was nothing in his appearance or manners which indicated that violence and relentless zeal with which he, some years afterwards, persecuted the Sooffees. f Aga Mahomed Aly observes, that ' the Sooffees are divided into a great number ' of sects. Some affirm,' he states, ' that only four are original; the others being no ' more than branches from them. The first of these is the Huloole^h, or ' the inspired ' by the Divinity.' The second is the It&amp;hedeah, or ' the unionists.' The third is the ' Wcissileah, or ' the joined.' The fourth is Ashake^h, or ' the lovers.' Some,' this author states, ' add two more. The fifth they term the Tulkeenecih, or ' the learned,' ' of 1 the teachersand the sixth are the Zeeruke^h, or' the penetrating.' Others,' he adds, ' have mentioned a seventh sect, whom they call W^hdatte&amp;.h, or 1 the solitudi- ' narians.'' This writer concludes by stating his belief, that there are only two original sects of Sooffees,—those mentioned in the text; and that all the others are derivatives.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 3 ^g maintained by the Hulooledh, or ' the inspired,' is, that God has ciiap.xxii. entered or descended into them ; and that the Divine Spirit enters into all who are devout and have an intelligent mind.

They compare the Almighty to flame, and liedeah * their souls to charcoal; and say, that in the same manner that charcoal when it meets flame becomes flame, their immortal part, from its union with God, becomes God. It has, the learned author here followed states, been affirmed f, that these two sects, which are now deemed original, are derived from a sect called Hermdne^h, who borrowed their tenets from the Sdbettedh, or ' ancient Sabians.' ' Impious men,' he observes, ' desiring to conceal from themselves &lt;{ the great error into which they had fallen, have tried to connect &lt;r the doctrines of these sects with that of the twelve holy Imaums, ' to which they have not the slightest affinity: but,' he adds, ' the ' principal tenets of the Huloole^h certainly approach the creed ' of the Nazarenes, who believe that the Spirit of God entered into ' the womb of the Virgin Mary, and thence the doctrine of the ' divine nature of their prophet, Jesus/' The Wdhdatteahi, or ' the solitudinarians|[,' whom this author * Aga Mahomed Aly^s Letter. f ' This is affirmed,' Aga Mahomed Aly says, ' by the author of the Bean-u-deen, u or ' expounder of religions.''

Among the most remarkable of these are the Dheri, or ' eternals/' who believe the world is uncreated and indissoluble; and conceive that man is taught his duty by a mysterious order of priesthood, whose numbers and ranks are fixed, and who rise in gradation from the lowest paths to the sublimest 8th. The MuMmette^h, or ' the reproached.' Aga Mahomed Aly observes, when speaking of this sect, ' Many SoofFees maintain the doctrine of necessity, which ' confounds all virtue and vice: but this sect proceed further, and give a preference to ' what the world call vice; and hence their name of ' the reproached.' But it is pro bable that this name is only given to them by their enemies. 9th. The Haleiih, or « persons in a proper state;' or, as it might be translated, ' g 00 d state.' This sect maintain, that the clapping of hands, dancing, and singing, to which they are accustomed, are involuntary. They affirm, that when they are in these fits, God comes to them and tells them secrets. ' They lay their heads' (they say,) ' in his bosom, and he lays his head on theirs. It is the stirring of the divine nature,' (they assert,) ' which leads to their dancing, and to all their extravagant joy.' 10th. The Houreih; so called, because they assert, that when they dance till they fall down insensible, they enjoy the society of the houries, or nymphs of paradise; and these delightful mistresses, they say, tell them of mysteries. 11th. The W&amp;kufFe£ih, or ' the knowing;' so called, from asserting, that none but themselves know God. Reason, they say, can never lead to that knowledge : it must be attained through the aid of a holy teacher. 12th. The Tusleem^h, or ' the obedient.;' a name given from their profession of a blind and devoted obedience to the commands (whatever they may be,) of their teacher.

Aga Mahomed Aly states,' that the sects of Ursulleah and Kullundereih have a similar usage.' 13th. The Tulkeeneih, or the Nezereah; that is, 'the teachers, or the observers.'

The Wullee^h, or ' holy favourites, whose teachers claim a share in the attributes of the Almighty, and assert, that they have power to raise the dead, or to kill the living; and who, pretending to imitate that God of whom they declare themselves a part, have neither wife nor dwelling. The Mushdruke^h, or ' friends/' who assert, that they are greater than the prophet, because they hold direct communion with God. bqt such, when initiated, can, they say, learn the disciple more in one hour, than a raoollah could in seventy years. Faith, this sect say, is not created; which, in one meaning, signifies 'faith is God,' The followers of this sect are generally dressed in khirkas, or « patched garments,' and wear a felt cap. They contemn worldly know ledge, and pretend to mysteries, io which they are instructed by a preparatory fast, during which they hardly taste food, and are kept in complete solitude. 14th. The Kumm&amp;leah, or ' the perfect,' who are described in the text. 15th. The Kh&amp;me&amp;h, or ' the inspired,' who are described by Aga Mahoraed as a sect of Epicureans, who seek nothing but the enjoyment of the present hour, and who are said not even to belieYe in a future state, 16th. The Noore^n, or ' the enlightened so termed, from their professed attach ment to Noor, which signifies ' light, or virtue,' and their horror at N&amp;r, which signifies ' fire,' and is, with them, the symbol of vice. 17th. The Battene^h, or the mysterious.' This sect, Aga Mahomed states, dgem madmen holy, and term them ' the abstracted.' 18lh. The Joudeah, or ' the thirsty.' This sect are accused of delighting in fables and allegories, of wearing silk and embroidered garments, and of indulging in sensual gratification. 19th. The Ashakeah, or ' the lovers.' The severe writer, who gives this account of the sects of Sooffees, says, that ' the Ashakeah profess themselves ardent lovers of ' God: but they continually address,' he adds, ' the fairest part of the Almighty s ' creation with a favourite sentence, which implies, that worldly love is the bridge over ' which those must pass who seek the joys of divine love' 20th. The Jumkhooreah, or ' the collected,' are described in the text.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 393 The HMeah, or those that have reached ' the good state/' who are chap.xxii. distinguished by their singing and clapping of hands, and by their falling into occasional trances, in which they pretend to visitations from the Almighty. The Kumm^leMi, or ' the perfect/' who reject all worldly occupation, except singing, dancing, and music; or, to use their own words, ' those pursuits in which the soul takes delight/' ' This sect/' the author who describes them observes, ' even sing their prayers.' The Noorean, or ' the enlightened,' who teach, that men's actions should neither proceed from the fear of punishment nor the hope of reward, but from innate love of virtue, and a detesta tion of vice. The twentieth and last branch of the Wdhdattedh is denominated Jumkhoore^h*, which means, ' the collected a nam6 that has been given them from their belief in the collected creeds of all the other sects of SoofFees. Their leading doctrine is, that nothing which exists should be rejected, for all things contain a portion of the Divinity. They are accused of being complete optimists: every thing is good with them : religion and infidelity; the lawful and unlawful. ' Like the Nazarenes,' the author who gives this account observes, ' they deem dogs and hogs clean animals; and, like them, they ' admit that females may go about unveiled. The greater part of ' the modern SoofFees f*,' he affirms, ' belong to this sect; and they * Jumkhooresih, considered as a compound word, may be translated ' the collected but the term jumkhoor signifies ' hollow ' (as a reed).

' dignify their indiscriminate principle of belief and of conduct ' w ith the exalted name of divine love/' I They declare The Mahomedan SoofFees have endeavoured to connect their Mahomed^to mystic faith with the doctrine of their prophet, who was himself, Sooffee. een a they assert, an accomplished Sooffee; and they interpret* many of the verses in the Koran, and some of'his traditionary sayings, in a manner calculated to give them the benefit of his great name. The Persian followers of this sect deem Aly, his sons, and all the twelve Imaums, as teachers of Sooffeeism. They state, that Aly deputed his two sons and two other holy men to teach the mysteries of this . faith; and from these many of the principal Kh^lif^s, or teachers, who have founded sects, derive their title to the sacred mantle f, which was the symbol of their spiritual power. * They quote a tradition of the prophet, from which they state that their four stages to attain perfection are derived. Mahomed is asserted, in this tradition, to have said, ' That the law (canonical) is as a vessel; the road or path is as the sea; ' knowledge of divine things is as the shell; and knowledge of the Divinity is as the ' pearl: but he who desires to obtain the pearl, must first embark in the vessel.' — Captain G raham's MS. on the Soqffees. f It appears, that though the khirk&amp;. or mantle was in general only transferred to a beloved pupil, at the death of his master, some superior saints were deemed possessed of a power, even while living, to invest others with this sacred and mysterious garment. Shahn&amp;viiz Khan informs us, in his Essay (the Moorut Aftab Namah) upon this sect, that four persons were empowered by Aly to disseminate the doctrines of the SoofFees. These were his two sons, the Imaums Hussein and Hussun, and two learned men, one named Hussein, of Bussorah, and another Kummyl, the son of Ze^t. Hussein, ot Bussorah, he adds, was succeeded by Abdool W^hed, the son of Zyd, and Hubbeeb-e- Ajumee, or Hubbeeb of Persia. The following five sects of fakeers, according to this writer, are derived from Abdool-W&amp;.hed.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 395 The dignity of KMIifd can only be attained by long fasting chap.xxil and .prayer, and by complete abstraction from all worldly pursuits.

The Zydean, who devote themselves to remain in deserts, and never enter towns or villages. They live entirely on vegetables and roots, holding the slaughter of any animal that hath life to be unlawful. 2d. The Alb&amp;ze^n take their name from Albaz, a Kh^lifS. or teacher, who was invested with the mantle by Abdool Walied. They affect solitude, and have neither wives nor children. They profess not to solicit alms, but to spend freely what comes unsolicited. 3d. The Adhume^n trace to the famous Sultan Ibrahim Adhum, who resigned the royal dignity to become a mendicant. They are always travelling, and are com- panionless. This sect continually move their lips in devotion. 4th. The B^hsireean, from BElharee, of Bussorah, who derives his mantle through two descents from Sultan Ibrahim Adhum. This sect are very reserved, and practise abstinence. 5th. The Khaujah Isaak. Their KMlifa was Khaujah Ulloo, of Deenawar, who derives his mantle, through two descents, from Baharee, of Bussorah. Their teacher avoided cities. He is said to have been of a very amorous disposition. According to ShahnSvsiz Khan, nine remarkable sects derive their origin from H ubbeeb-Aj u mee. 1st. The Ajumeean take their name from their founder. They chiefly dwell in mountains, are very abstemious, and wear no dress but what is barely sufficient to cover their nakedness. This sect attach themselves to animals and birds, with which -they form friendships. 2d. The Tyfoorean take their name from Bayezeed of Bustam, one of whose names was Tyfoor-Bayezeed. He was one of the most celebrated of the Sooffees of Persia, and derived his mantle from Hubeeb-Ajumee. 3d. The Kirkeetin derive their name from M&amp;roof, of Kirkee, who, this author states, was a favoured disciple of the Imaum RezS., to whom he is said, in another MS.,THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xxii. knowledge of angels, requires a long and awful probation. Great numbers perish in their efforts to reach it. The person who makes the attempt must be a holy mooreed or disciple, who, by devotion and abstraction, has already made a progress that has placed him above the necessity of the common usages and forms of established religion. He must commence his endeavour to attain a state of higher beatitude by a long fast, which some sects conceive should not be to have been a porter. Some of the most celebrated of the modern teachers pretend to derive their authority from this saint. 4th. The Sakettee 4 derive their name from Seree S^ket, who was a disciple of Mar oof. 5th. JunydeS,n take their name from Shaikh Junyd of Bagdad, a Khalifa or teacher of celebrity, who received his mantle from Seree S£Lket. 6th. Kazeroonean. This sect has its name from Aboo Isaak, of Kazeroon, who derives his mantle, through two descents, from Shaik Junyd. 7th. Tooseean take their name from Allah-u-deen, of Toos, who, after five in termediate gradations or descents, (the term in the original is Punj-Wdsdttah,) in herited the mantle of Shaikh Junyd. 8th. Sohdiverdeeguis, who take their name from Aboo Nujub of Sohraverdee, who, through five descents, derived his mantle from Hubbeeb-e-Ajumee. 9th. FerdosiS.n, who take their name from Nijum-u-deen Ferdosi, who was the Kh&amp;lifa or teacher of Aboo-Nujub of Sohrsiverdee. The same author gives a long list of other sects derivative from the above ; and it is remarkable, that the Khalifas, or holy teachers, of every one of these sects, either have, or pretend to have, a hereditary right to their mantle from some holy saint: among these he mentions a sect of fakeers called the Suffaveans, who trace themselves to Shaik Suffee-u-deen 5 of Ardebil, who, he observes, derived his mantle, through some gradations, from the Shaikh Junyd of Bagdad. 4 This word means a metal-seller; sa/ie# signifies metal. 5 The ancestors of the Suffavean Monarchs of Persia.A. iofes *ta^ ^ state of ^ m ^khk ^ et i*lioiasaiiso^ tiki 00 Isaak, dlmjt 1 of TooSj^aftsb igbal is Prajljii ^jj NojobofSoliBd^m ijomec. •deenFenl^ifiioK:- ifeltoBiliejt«ii«!iii ie of tbesc sects, eiiimim in some liolj « t:il111 !

During this fast he remains in solitude, and in chap.xxii. a contemplative posture; and receives no sustenance but what is deemed barely necessary to prevent the soul taking its flight from its mortal tenement. Upon the patience and fortitude which he dis plays during this severe test, his character greatly depends : but when the skeleton (for such, after this fast, the disciple always appears) walks forth, he has still many years of trial to endure. He must either wander over deserts, or remain companionless in some fright ful solitude, occasionally seeing the KMlif&amp; or teacher to whom he is attached : for the chief merit of Sooffees, through all their ranks, is devotion to their spiritual leader. When the KMlif&amp; dies he bequeaths his patched garment, which is all his worldly wealth, to the disciple whom he esteems the most worthy to be his successor; and the moment the latter puts on the holy mantle, he is vested with the power of his predecessor. The Persian Sooffees, though they have borrowed much of their belief and many of their usages from India, have not adopted, as a means of attaining beatitude, those dreadful austerities which are common among the visionary devotees of the Hindoos. Practices so abhorrent to nature required for their support all that influence which ignorance and superstition united could gain over the human mind. The most celebrated of the teachers of the Sooffee tenets in Persia have been men as famed for their knowledge as their devotion. In the list of these, modern Sooffees desire to include every name which has obtained a pre-eminence in the history of their country, or in the worldThey claim, in fact, all who, by their writings or sayings, # The Mahomedan SoofFees claim the Patriarch Abraham as one of their principal teachers. ' That holy man,' they say, ' turned day into night, and night into day, by ' his constant and undivided devotion of the most high God.' — Persian MS.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xxii. have shown a spirit of philosophy, or a knowledge of the divine nature, which elevated them above the prejudices of the vulgar. But though this claim cannot be maintained, as many of the wisest and ablest men of Persia have been remarkable for their attachment to the forms and dogmas of the established worship, the Sooffees can boast that great numbers, as eminent for their learning as their genius, have adopted their opinions. Among these the most distin guished are poets. The progress of the improvement of the human mind is the same in all nations. The first ray of light that illumines a dark and barbarous age emanates from the poet, and his page long continues to be that which is chiefly, if not solely admired. The natives of Persia are enthusiastically devoted to poetry: the meanest artisan of the principal cities* of that kingdom can read or repeat some of the finest passages from their most admired writers: and even the rude and unlettered soldier leaves his tent, to listen with rapture to the strain of the minstrel who sings a mystic song of divine love, or recites the tale of a battle of his forefathers. The very essence of SofFeeism is poetry. The extravagant raptures of genius expatiating on a subject that can never be exhausted, are deemed holy inspira tions by those who believe that the emancipated soul can wander at large in the regions of imagination, and even unite with its Creator. The Musnavi -f-, which teaches in the sweetest strains # I was forcibly struck with this fact during my residence in Persia. I found several of my servants well acquainted with the poetry of their country; and when I was at Isfahan in 1800, I was surprised to hear a common tailor, that was at work repairing one of my tents, entertain his companions with repeating some of the finest of the mystical odes of Hafiz. f This celebrated work was written by Shaikh Jellal-u-deen, usually called the Moollah of Room.

It is to them that they continually refer; and the gravest writers, who have defended their doctrine, take their proofs from the page of these and other poets, whom they deem to have been inspired by their holy theme. Their tenets The SoofFee tenets are, as may be supposed from what has been mystery. ' said, involved in mystery: they commence in doctrines of general piety and virtue, and inculcate forbearance, abstemiousness, and universal benevolence. This is their profession; but they have secrets and mysteries for every gradation, which are never revealed to the profane. Munsoor Helaj, one of the most eminent of their spiritual leaders, who, they believe, had attained the fourth or last stage of Sooffeeism, proclaimed, ' I am the truth;' or, in other words, ' I am Godf' The constant repetition of this impious ' He gives the bane, and he with balsam cures; ' Afflicts, yet sooths; impassions, yet allures. ' Hail, heav'nly love! true source of endless gains! ' Thy balm restores me; and thy skill sustains. ' Oh, more than Galen learn'd, than Plato wise! « My guide, my law, my joy supreme, arise! ' Love warms this frigid clay with mystic fire, ' And dancing mountains leap with young desire. ' Blest is the soul, that swims in seas of love, ' And long the life sustain'd by food above.

One of these states, that he observed his sister go out every evening: heTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 401 phrase alarmed the bigotry of the orthodox priests, and he was chap.xxii. seized and impaled. An inspired Sooffee is said to have demanded of the Almighty why he permitted Munsoor to suffer? The reply was, ' This is the punishment of the revealer of secrets*.' Among Their desire to the many fables they relate of this holy person, is one that marks distinctly the manner in which they desire to reconcile their doc- mlhoml 0f trines with the faith of Mahomed. When Munsoor Heldj was carried to the stake, the executioners, they observe, could not perform their duty : it was in vain they endeavoured to seize him ; his body eluded their grasp, and appeared seated in a composed posture in the air, at some distance from the stake *1*. While this was occurring upon earth, his soul sought the regions of paradise. He was accosted by Mahomed, who admitted that he had arrived at the stage of W&amp;ssil&amp;h, or ' union,' and that his saying he was God was truth: but he entreated him, for the sake of practical religion, which was necessary to keep men within proper limits, to permit himself to be impaled. The soul of the holy man, convinced of the justice of what the prophet had said, returned to earth, to reanimate his body, which endured the death to which he had been sentenced. The principal fables of the Sooffees relate to those of their sect Their belief in who have suffered martyrdom. Of these, one of the most celebrated fobleS ' is Shems Tubreezee, who was sentenced to be flead alive J, on followed her, and having seen her communicate with the houries, and receive from these celestial nymphs a cup of nectar, he insisted upon drinking one or two drops that remained of this celestial liquor.

He persisted; and from the moment that he swallowed it he kept exclaiming, An-ool-huk! that is,« I am the truth!' till he was put to death. * Persian MS. f Captain Graham's MS.

We are told, that after the law had been put in force, he wandered about, carrying his own skin, and solicited some food to appease his hun ger: but he had been excommunicated as well as flead, and no one would give him the slightest help. After four days he found a dead ox, but his efforts to obtain fire to dress it were unsuccessful. Wearied out with the unkindness of men, he directed the sun to broil his meat. It descended, to perform the office; and the world was upon the point of being consumed, when the holy Shaikh commanded the flaming orb to resume its station in the heavens* The general belief of these monstrous fables, relative to the divine nature of their spiritual leaders, is a just subject of reproach against the whole of the Sooffees; who are also accused by orthodox Maho- medans of having no fixed faith, but of professing a respect which they do not feel for religion, that they may smooth the path of those whom they desire to delude. They pretend, their enemies state, to revere the prophet and the Imaums, yet conceive themselves above the forms and usages which these holy personages not only observed, but deemed of divine institution, in predest'ma- Though the belief of predestination appears to be inculcated by the Koran, few of the orthodox among the Mahomedans give a literal construction to the words of their prophet upon this subject. They deem it, indeed, profane to do so, as it would make God the author of the guilt of man : but almost all the Sooffees are predesti- narians. They believe, that the emanating principle, proceeding from God, can do nothing without his will, and can refrain from # Captain Graham's MS.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 403 nothing that he wills.

The Sooffees of this class exclaim with the poet, ' The ' writer of our destiny is a fair writer, and never wrote that which ' was bad/' While those who admit that there is evil in this world, but contend that man is not a free agent, repeat from Hafiz, ' My destiny has been thrown into a tavern* by the Almighty. ' In this case, tell me, O teacher! where is my crime ?' The SoofFees, we are told by one of the most violent and able of their enemies, deem every thing in the world a type of the beauty and power of the Divinity : but he adds, that it appears from both their actions and writings, that it is in the red cheeks of beautiful damsels that they contemplate his beauty; and in the impious daring of Nimrod and of Pharaoh, that they see and admire the omnipo tence of his power.

One of the writers* of this sect goes so far as to assert, that those condemned to hell, will soon, from the habit of living there, not only be reconciled to its heat, but deem it a blessing, and look with disgust on the enjoyments of paradise 'f*. The SoofFees are accused of seeking to delude the Persians into a belief of their tenets by the most extravagant praises of their favourite Aly; who, according to them, was acquainted with all the mysteries of their doctrine J: but they are, he affirms, equal admirers of the three first caliphs when with Soonees, on the same * Kysuree. f This author, according to Aga Mahomed Aly, says, that a sinner in hell will, in a short time, be like a beetle in the midst of dung, which, delighted with its unclean mansion, abhors all sweet scents. J The poet Jellal-u-deen makes Aly, when he is wounded by an assassin, declare, ' I ' am the lord of the country, but with my body I have no concern. You have not struck ' me; you are a mere instrument of Providence; and who shall pretend to revenge him- ' self on Providence ? Be not grieved, therefore, at what you have done, for to-morrow ' I am your advocate!' Aga Mahomed Aly, after making this quotation, asks, ' To ' what does such doctrine lead ?

In the account which he gives of the different sects of Sooffees, he states a number of facts, calculated to show the extravagant blasphemy of their teachers, and the blind credulity of their followers. ' A Sooffee -jV' he remarks, ' has told us, that one ' day, when he was intoxicated, he saw God, who was in the figure ' of a man, with a coat on, his hair plaited, and his cap cocked on ' one side. 4 I struck him on the shoulder/ this Sooffee writes, ' and exclaimed, 4 By the truth of thy unity I know thee; and ' if thou assumest a hundred shapes, it will not conceal thee from ' my observation !' This is one of those impious madmen/' he observes, ' whom fools have worshipped as a saint/' The spiritual leaders of the Sooffees, the same author states, are not only believed to perform miracles, but to live in continual com munion with God; and one of the most celebrated of these teachers, whose life, with all the fables J attached to it, is a Their belief la the miracles of their teachers. * Aga Mahomed Aly quotes an Arabic sentence, which is, he states, often repeated by their writers. It literally means, ' a Sooffee knows no religion,' but they interpret it, ' a Sooffee thinks ill of no religion;' or, in other words, from having none them selves, they treat all with equal favour and consideration. — Aga Mahomed Aly's MS. t Shaikh Rozabahar Tursee, a teacher of the W^hdatteah, or ' the Unionists.'

' The day before the feast of Araf,' he observes, ' I ' went out to the fields and laid hold of the tail of a cow, which, turning round, ex- ' claimed: ' Oh Abdool Kauder, am I not that which thou hast created me?' I ' returned home, and went up to the terrace of my house; I saw all the pilgrims ' standing at the mountain of Arafat at Mecca. I went and told my mother that I ' must devote myself to God: I wished to proceed to Bagdad to obtain knowledge. ' I informed her what I had seen, and she wept: then taking out eighty deenars, she ' told me, that as I had a brother, half of that was all my inheritance.

When they were dividing the spoil, I was called to an eminence ' where their chief stood. ' What property have you, my little fellow ?' said he. — 'I ' have told two of your people already,' I replied ; ' I have forty deenars sewed up ' carefully in my clothes.' He desired them to be ript open, and found my money. ' * And how came you,' said he with surprise, ' to declare so openly what has been so ' carefully hidden ?' —' Because,' I replied, { I will not be false to my mother, to ' whom I have promised that I will never conceal the truth.' — * Child,' said the robber, ' ' hast thou such a sense of thy duty to thy mother at thy years; and am I insensible, ' at my age, of the duty I owe to my God ?

' You have been our leader in guilt,' said they to their ' chief,' be the same in the path of virtue:' and they instantly, at his order, made ' restitution of their spoil, and vowed repentance on my hand.'

The learned author* who has been so frequently quoted in the above account of the Sooffees, treats every sect that comes under that denomination with a severity that must detract from the credit which is due to his extensive knowledge of the subject. There is no doubt that many of the most eminent Sooffees have been men of piety and learning, whose self-denial and wisdom have attracted a fame which they did not seek-f-; while others have clothed themselves in the garb of humility to attain greatness. are spoken of with rapture. God, according to the author I write from, granted all his requests: and the Divine vengeance fell on those he hated. In A. H. 521 he began his public lectures. High Soonee authorities of the sect of Shaffei report many of his miracles. He himself gives the following account of his fasting, previous to his becoming a disciple of his teacher. ' I was eleven years,' he observes, ' in a burj, ' (tower,) and when there I declared to God I would not eat or drink till some one ' caused me to do so. I remained forty days; after which, a person brought a little ' meat, put it before me, and went away: my life was nearly springing out at the ' sight of the victuals, but I refrained: and I heard a voice from within me call out, ' ' I am hungry, I am hungry ;' and at that moment Shaikh Abou Syud Mukzoomee ' (a celebrated Sooffee,) passed, and, hearing the voice, exclaimed: * What is that?' « —&lt; It is my mortal part,' I replied ; '■ but the soul is yet firm, and awaits the result.'— ' 1 Come to my house,' he said; and went away. I resolved, however, to fulfil my ' vow, and remained where I was: but Elias came and told me to follow the Syud, ' whom I found at his door waiting. ' You would not comply with my wish,' said he, ' 1 till it was enforced by Elias.' After this, he gkve me meat and drink in plenty, ' and then invested me with a khirka, (or sacred mantle,) and I became his confirmed ' friend and companion.' * Aga Mahomed Aly. f The author of the Ayeen Akberry relates, that Wyss KeT &amp;nee, a Sooffee who had given up the world, used to say to those that sought him, ' Do you seek God ?

There is no path to fame and power, however unseemly, and however rugged, into which man will not enter; and the same passions which stimulate the worldly votary of ambition to the attainment of royal robes and a sceptre, fills the breast of the mendicant devotee, who strives for the holy staff and the sacred mantle that are to vest him with power over the minds of the multi tude. It has been truly observed, that the greatest objection to Sooffeeism is, that it is in itself no religion : wherever it prevails, it unsettles the existing belief; but it substitutes no other of a defined and intelligible nature. Though it professes to leave the mass of the people in the state in which it found them, it never can. Their minds are taught to consider an attention to all the forms of the religion they follow as a mere worldly duty, from which they are to be eman cipated by an increase of knowledge, or of devotion. We can con template no attack that is more insidious, or that is more likely to be effectual. It is to praise the beauty and utility of an edifice, that leisure may be given to sap those foundations on which it stands. The Sooffee teacher does not deny the mission of Mahomed: but while he instructs his disciples to consider that prophet and his suc cessors as persons who have been used as instruments for preserving the order and good government of the world, he boasts a direct and familiar intercourse with the Deity; and claims, on that ground, their entire confidence and obedience in all that regards their spiritual interests. ' do, why do you come to me? And if you do not seek God, what business can I have ' with you ?'THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 409 A Persian author*, of very high reputation for his piety and chap.xxil judgment, has given an excellent general account of the SoofFees, Cauzee Noor- and their doctrine. This writer, like many others of equal autho- Allah's ac- rity, deem some of the principal Mahomedan saints to have been SoXel, Ld SoofFees: but, by this term, when applied to them, he obviously theudoctnnes means no more than religious enthusiasts; and throughout his obser vations upon this sect, he makes a wide distinction between those who, though they mortified the flesh, and indulged in an enraptured love of the Divinity, still kept within the pale of revealed religionj and the wild devotee, who, giving himself up to all the errors of a heated imagination, conceived he approached God, by departing from all that was deemed rational among men. ' The Almighty/' this author observes, ' after his prophets and ' holy teachers, esteems none more than the pure SoofFees, because ' their desire is, to raise themselves, through divine grace, from this ' earthly mansion, to the heavenly regions, and to exchange their ' lowly condition for that of angels. What I know of this sect qf ' men,' he continues, ' I have stated in my preface^. Those # Cauzee Noor-ullah, of Shuster, who wrote the Mujalis-ul-Momineen, (a work upon the Sheah faith,) is deemed one of the most moderate and sensible of Persian authors. t The following is part of the passage in the preface to which the author alludes:— ' The SoofFees are of two classes. Those who desire human knowledge, and the com- ' mon usages of religion, and pursue these in the ordinary way, are called MootS,-kul- ' lum, i. e. ' advocates,' or ' observers but if they practise austerities, and look to ' the inward purity of their souls, they are Sooffees.' This word literally means ' pure, clean.' The celebrated Moollah of Room has the following play upon the word in one of his lines : ' Soqffee na shewud safee td dir na rdseed jamee which means, vol. ii. 3 g410 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xxn. ' among them who are termed accomplished and eloquent are of ' two classes, 4 men of science^/ and 4 men of piety and learningf/ ' The first of these seek truth by means of demonstration. The ' second, through the proofs afforded by religion. There is another ' sect, who are termed 4 men of knowledge J/ and 4 holy men ||/ who, 44 in the pursuit of a state of beatitude, have abandoned the world. 44 This class are also 4 men of science / yet, as they have, through 44 divine grace, obtained a state of perfection, their fears are believed 44 to be less than others who remain in worldly occupation §. They 44 are, consequently, more exalted ; and are considered to be nearer ' the rich inheritance of the prophets than other men ^[. There are, 44 no doubt/' he proceeds to state, 44 imminent dangers in this 44 path : for there are many false teachers, and many deceived 44 students, who, like the thirsty traveller, pursue the vapour of the 44 desert; and, if they do not rush to death, return wearied, grieved, 44 and disappointed, because they have been the dupes of their own 44 imagination. A true and perfect teacher is most rare; and when literally, ' The Sooffee will not be pure till he takes one cup.' The meaning of this line is deemed mystical. * Hook£im^h. f Oulamah. % Arufah. H Ouleiih. § It is stated, that the disciple of a famous Sooffee, who had some money in his pocket when he was travelling, expressed fear. Turs-be-andaz, i. e. ' Cast away thy ' fear,' was the answer of his holy master. ' How can I cast away a feeling i' said the man. ' By throwing away that for which it is excited,' replied the ascetic. The man threw away his money, and, having nothing to lose, felt no more alarm.— Persian MS. IT This author observes, that ' Shaikh Abou-ul-Senna, or Avicenna, has, in the ' Mukfon&amp;t-ul-Ar&amp;.fyn, stated all that he has done of this sect.'THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. ' he exists, to discover him is impossible; for who shall discover per- ' fection, except he that is perfect ? who shall tell the price of the ' jewel, but the jeweller? This is the reason why so many miss the ' true path, and fall into all the mazes of error. They are deceived by ' appearances, and waste their lives in the pursuit of that which is ' most defective; conceiving, all along, that it is most perfect; and ' thus lose both their time, their virtue, and their religion. It is to ' save men from this danger that God, through the prophet, has ' warned us to attend to established usages, and to be guided by ' care and prudence. What has been said/' this sensible writer ob serves, ' applies equally to those who live in the world, and to them (i who have abandoned it; for neither abstinence nor devotion can ' exclude the devil, who will seek retired mendicants, clothed in the ' garb of divinity ; and these, like other men, will discover that real ' knowledge is the only talisman by which the dictates of the good ' can be distinguished from those of the evil spirit. The traveller ' of the path of Sooffeeism must not, therefore, be destitute of ' worldly knowledge, otherwise he will be alike exposed to dan- ' ger, from excess, or deficiency of zeal; and he will certainly act 44 contrary to the most sacred of his duties. A senseless man/' he continues, ' is likely, in the practice of abstinence and abstraction, ' to exceed the just bounds; and then both his bodily and mental ' frame become affected, and he loses his labour and his object. 44 It is to men of this description that the prophet adverts, when he 44 says, 4 God will not accept the irrational devotee:' and again, 4&lt; when he exclaims, 4 My back has been broken by pious fools, 44 and useless learned men/ '412 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. This writer, after some remarks on the affinity between virtuous Sheahs and Sooffees, observes, ' that many of the latter have dis- 44 guised their real sentiments from their alarm at persecuting tyrants; ' and have given general answers, and pretended to be of no parti- ' cular faith, to escape the effects of that fury which was pointed at ' the Sheahs. The consequence of this conduct has been, that they 44 have subjected themselves to the reproach of having no religion at « all: and, for the reasons I have stated,' he adds, ' it has become ' a tenet among Sooffees not to confess their religion. It is, « indeed, considered among themselves a crime of the deepest turpi- ' tude to do so. ' The Sooffee teacher,' (according to Cauzee Noor-ftllah,) ' professes to instruct his disciple how to restore the inward man ' by purifying the spirit, cleansing the heart, enlightening the ' head, and anointing the soul: and when all this is done, they ' affirm that his desires shall be accomplished, and his depraved ' qualities shall be changed into higher attributes*, and he shall ' prove and understand the conditions, the revelations, the stages-f* • Or qualities: ihe same word, Ichal^ik, is repeated. + We are informed by Ferishta, an Indian Mahomedan author of celebrity, that the degrees of the saints of these religious men are four, which he denominates, so^ra, ' the least;' wdsittdh, ' the middle or great;' kubra, ' the greater;' and uzmdh, ' the greatest.' Every Sooffee should attain diattee, ' the beginning;' wasit- tah, ' the middle;*' and nehaittee, ' the end.' The holy men of these descriptions in this world are never less, this author adds, than three hundred and fifty-six persons, who are always employed in aiding others and curing souls. The principal Sooffees believe that three hundred of this number are abtal, ' erroneous or false;' forty abddl, ' pious ' men;' seven asidh, ' running watersfive dutdd, ' propsthree kutb, ' poles;THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 413 ft'l BOfi 5 Nil ' and gradations of exaltation, till he arrives at the ineffable enjoy- chap.xxh. ' ment of beholding and contemplating God. If teachers/^ he continues, ' have not arrived at this consummation of perfection ' themselves, it is obvious that to seek knowledge or happiness ' from them is a waste of time; and the devoted disciple will either ' terminate his labours in assuming the same character of im- ' posture that he has found in his instructor*, or he will consider ' all Sooffees alike, and condemn the whole of this sect of philoso- ' phersf. It often happens/' he adds, ' that sensible and well- ' informed men follow a master who, though able, has not arrived at ' that state of virtue and sanctity which constitute perfection: his ' disciples conceiving that none are better or more holy than their ' teacher and themselves, and yet disappointed at not reaching that ' state of enjoyment which they expected to arrive at, seek relief ibofdr- ffhicli lie J®®® 'tieptf;'* of these ocipalW^ and one kuth-ul-dctdb, or ' the pole of poles.' When any one of these persons dies he is succeeded by another of the rank below him, and so on in regular succession: for instance, if the pole of poles dies, one of the poles fills his place, and so on till one of the people is brought into the rank of abtdl, or ' erroneous.' Among the three hundred and fifty-six persons, the same author adds, nine only are deemed qualified to delegate or invest others with authority as teachers; these nine consist of the kutb- ul-dddb, ' the pole of polesthe three kutbs, or ' polesand five of the autad, or ' propsand those nine alone, he informs us, can be deemed perfect teachers. * Shaikh is the word generally applied to the principal teachers among the Sooffees, and is always used by this author to describe them. t Philosoof, which signifies a philosopher, is a word in common use in Persia. It was formerly, they state, applied to Plato and others, who are now known under the more dignified name of HooMm&amp;h, or ' men of science.' Impostors in philosophy appear in the East to have degraded the term of 'philosoof, which, in the idiom of the present day, signifies a master in deceit and art.414 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap .xxii. ' from the reproaches of their own mind in scepticism. They ' doubt, on the ground of their personal experience, all they have ' heard, or read, and believe, that the accounts of the holy men who ' have attained in this world a state of beatitude are only a string ' of fables. This/' our author remarks, ' is a dangerous error; and &lt;e I must, therefore/' he concludes, 44 repeat, that those who seek ' truth should be most careful to commence with prudence and ' moderation, lest they be lost in the mazes that I have described; ' and, from meeting with evils of their own creation, give way to ' disappointment and grief; and, by expelling from their minds that ' ardent fervour which belongs to true zeal, disqualify themselves ' for the most glorious of all human pursuits/' Rapid progress The progress of SoofFeeism has been of late very rapid in Persia. of Sooffeeism in Persia. Its tenets were mixed with those of the Sheah sect, when that was established as the national faith by the first of the SufFavean kings; and some of the monarchs of that race gloried in professing tenets which they inherited from their pious ancestor Shaikh Hyder *, who is deemed one of the most celebrated of the SoofFee teachers in Persia. The orthodox hierarchy of Persia have from the first made an open and violent war upon this sect: and though they have often failed in rousing the bigotry of the sovereign in their defence, they have always succeeded in convincing his judgment that the established religion # Kempfer mentions a book called the Kar^-jild, or 'black volume,' which, he says, the SufFavean monarchs inherited from their pious ancestors. This mysterious legacy was not to be opened till the kingdom was in imminent danger of ruin; and it was supposed to contain counsel and prophecies that would be useful on the occurrence of this extremity. I have never met with an account of the K&amp;r&amp;^ild in any Persian author.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 415 was necessary to the support of the state, and that nothing could be chap. xxii. more dangerous than the progress of a spirit of infidelity, which, by unsettling men's minds, was calculated to throw them into a state of doubt and ferment. The principal Sooffee teachers, they admitted, might act from different motives : some might be the deluded dupes of their own imagination, while others sought only to delude their followers: but the tenets and the rhapsodies of all tended to the same point; they desired first to abolish the forms of religion, that they might with more ease destroy the substance; they pretended that in their own contemplation they allowed no name, not even that of the Prophet Mahomed, to come between them and their God; but with the very breath that they uttered this sentence they desired to come between God and all other men. The SoofFee teachers, they said, endeavoured to destroy names to which men gave reve rence, with no other object but that of substituting their own : for the first and fundamental tenet of SoofFeeism inculcated, that the profane or erring could not advance a step without a spiritual guide, and that their progress in the true path would be exactly in proportion to their confidence in their holy instructor. What was this, the Mahomedan priests asked, but a desire of becoming the idols* of men's worship; and it could be, they argued, of little consequence to a country, which their bigotry or ambition had thrown into confusion, whether the men by whom this was effected ♦ The Moorteza Shahee, who are a sect of SoofFees, make an image of their teacher in clay, which the disciple keeps, to prevent him from wandering, and to bring him, through continual contemplation, to complete identity with his guide or saint. Persian MS.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap .xxii. were desirous of a heavenly or an earthly crown; whether they pulled down the fabric from the mere wish of destroying what they deemed bad, or with the object of building with its ruins something which in their, imagination would appear more beautiful. They affirmed, that if they did not seek to excite commotion and rebel lion, their doctrines threw the community into a state the most favourable for those who had such designs: and they asserted, that the history of Persia, and neighbouring nations, abounded with examples of their successful efforts to obtain temporal power, through the influence of their spiritual character. Hussun Subah and his descendants were a race of Sooffees*; and the implicit obedience which their devoted followers had given to those moun tain chiefs had, for two centuries, filled Persia with murders, and made the proudest monarchs of that country, and neigh bouring empires, tremble at the name of their mysterious power. The history of Bayezeed, the founder of the SoofFee sect of Roshenedh-f, or ' the enlightened/' was, they said, not essentially different from that of Hussun Subah: and Bayezeed had established, amid the mountains of Affghanistan, a temporal power upon the authority of his spiritual character, that enabled him and his succes sors to disturb the tranquillity of the Empire of Delhi, when that had reached, under the celebrated Ackbar, the very zenith of its power. * Hussun Subah is said to have belonged to the SoofFee sect of Batteneah. The history of this chief and his descendants has been given, vide Vol. I. page 395. f For the history of this sect, vide papers of the late Mr. Leyden, Asiatic Researches, Vol. XI.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. ^ There was enough of truth in the arguments above stated to chap.xxii. awaken all the suspicion of the temporal rulers of Persia; and recent events were calculated to render the government of that country active in their efforts to suppress a heresy of so alarming a character. The Suffavean kings had been taught, by a recollection of their own origin, to be jealous of any of their subjects who appeared disposed to have recourse to the same means : but the Sooffees in their dominions were never actively persecuted before the reign of the last monarch of that race, Shah Sultan Hussein^, who gave himself into the hands of priests of the orthodox religion, and allowed them to exercise every severity towards all who departed from the forms of established worship. The attempt of Nddir Shah f to alter the Sheah faith, and to adopt that of the Soonee as the national religion of Persia, and the discussion of sacred topics which that monarch, in the latter years of his reign, invited for the purpose, as he professed, of framing a new faith, had, no doubt, a serious effect in diminishing the influence of the Mahomedan religion upon the minds of the inhabitants of that kingdom. Kurreem Khan, though reputed a true believer, and an observer of the forms of worship, was neither rigid himself, nor into lerant of others. During his reign, a celebrated Sooffee teacher, a.h.1191. named Meer Maassoom Aly Shahlf, came from India to Shiraz, where his followers soon amounted to more than thirty thousand persons. The orthodox priests took alarm, and prevailed upon the mild Kurreem to banish the saint from his capital: but his reputation * Vide Vol. I. page 594. f Vide Vol. II. page 63. t Meer Maassoom is called a disciple of Syud Aly Reza, a native of the Deckan. vol. ii. 3 h418 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xxii. was increased by the act of power that proclaimed him dangerous. After Kurreem Khan's death, Meer Maassoom, who resided in a a.h. 1195. small village near Isfahan, deputed his first disciple, Fj ^z Aly*, # The author of the life of sorafe of the principal of the modern Sooffee teachers of Persia states, that Fyaz Aly was of the sect of Noor-Buksheedh, or ' the Enlightened,' who trace their origin to Maroof, of Kirkee; and that he aspired to be the teacher of his sect till Meer Maassoom arrived from India, when he instantly bowed to his superior in knowledge, and was content to become his first disciple. This writer has given us a statement of seventeen tenets, which, he says, are openly professed by this sect. These were as follow : 1st. To adore nothing and no person, but God. 2d. To attend to the ordinances of the Prophet and the twelve Imaums. 3d. To be always pure by ablution, and to deprecate the wrath of God. 4th. To observe the regular periods of prayer. 5th. To attend to the five lessons decreed to be observed after particular prayers. 6th. To use the tusbee, or ' string of beads,' constantly saying, ' O God, thou art ' the true and only God ; thou alone art pure ; I am an unworthy sinner, but thou art the Forgiver of sinners.' 8th. To remember the constant necessity of a moorshed, or teacher, to give strength to devotion, and to give aid in the dark and difficult path. 9th. To welcome every grief and misfortune as a blessing. 10th. To pain neither yourself nor others. llth. To trace every morning and evening, with the forefingers of your right hand, on your forehead, the name of the true God, of the Prophet, and the twelve Itnauras; and on the first of every month, when you see the new moon, to trace the same sacred words on your breast. 12th. To eat what is lawful, and clothe yourself in clean robes; as these outward habits aid inward purity. 13th. Reverence your parents with a reverence like unto devotion. 14th. Preserve the mysteries of your sect as a profound secret. 15th. To let your heart be always with God, wherever your body may be.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 410 fjfej,. :as Ntoie|^ to teach in that city. That holy person soon died, and was succeeded chap.xxii. in his office by his son, Noor Aly Shah; who, though young in years, was, to use the phrase of his historian, ' old in piety.'

Aly MoorM Khan, and recommended him so strongly to support the A ' H ' 1197 ' faith, by the punishment of those whose opinions were alike hostile to true religion and good government, that the monarch, the moment he received their representation, sent orders to cut off the noses and ears of some of the most zealous of the obnoxious sect; and, as a further disgrace, to shave the beards of all who had adopted their opinions. The ignorant soldiers intrusted with the execution of this mandate, were not very capable of discriminating between true believers and infidels: and we are assured by a cotemporary writer-^, that many orthodox Mahomedans had their noses and ears cut off; and their beards shaved, upon this memorable occasion. 16th. To be kind unto all men, to pain none, and to desire to pain none. 17th. To resign yourself to the will of God in all things ; never to complain, but to be grateful for every thing. These, this writer adds, were the seventeen articles of faith to which this sect was, as far as his knowledge went, required to conform. These were the tenets, he says, taught by Fyaz Aly, before the arrival of Meer Maassoom in Persia. * The writer of the MS. here followed informs us, that men notorious for their profligacy and infamy were employed as spies to discover the doctrine of the Sooffees. These men, he says, reported, that Meer Maassoom was considered as a god by his dis ciples; and that Noor Aly Shah, Mooshtak Aly Shah, and others of his favourite dis ciples, personated the angels Gabriel, Israel, &amp;c. &amp;c. f Persian MS.a. d. 1785. a. h. 1200. a.d. 1789. a. h. 1204. a. d. 1794. a. h. 1209. a. d. 1797. a. h, 1212. the history of persia. Some of the principal inhabitants of Isfahan^, shocked at these proceedings, interested themselves in favour of the SooiFees, and Aly Moored was persuaded to send a second order to stop the persecu tion he had at first commanded : but Meer Maassoom Alj, and Noor Aly Shah, were not willing to remain where they had been so pub licly proscribed; and they proceeded, accompanied by a crowd of followers, to Kerman; where, however, the chief priest, alarmed by the defection of his flock, denounced vengeance against them, and forced Meer Maassoom to fly to Mushed in Khorassan. He was refused admission into that city, and went to Herat, with the desire of proceeding by Cabul to India: but his fame, and the number of his followers, alarmed the King of the Affghans, who compelled him to return to Persia. At Kerman, to which he returned, Mooshtak Aly, the most pious of his disciples, was put to death. One of the crimes of this person was his excellence as a musician. We are told, that he played upon the t^r (a species of guitar with three strings,) in so harmonious and touching a manner, as to melt into tears all who heard him : and, among other accusations, it was alleged that he had, with unpardonable blasphemy, called his guitar a divine instrument! Noor Aly Shah and Meer Maassoom had proceeeded to Ker- belah, and intended, we are informed, to have remained there as a place of safety: but the solicitations of the inhabitants of Ker- manshah, where they had before resided, induced them to revisit that city. I he numbers that crowded to meet them excited the * Meerza Anayet-Allah MustofFee is said to have been the person who first unde ceived AJy Moorad Khan, and caused him to stop the persecution of the Sooffees,THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 4n jealousy and indignation of the chief priest^ who was a man of chap.xxii. the highest reputation both for his learning and piety. Alarmed at the rapid progress of infidelity^ this pontiff determined to put an instant stop to it by the most violent measures. He placed Noor Aly Shah in confinement; and, during the commotion that followed this act, care was taken that some of the swords of the faithful should slay Meer Maassoom^ who was murdered when at prayers in the midst of his followers. The king highly approved of the conduct of the chief priest of Kermanshah, who, in a most able, but violent letter to the prime minister, that was made publicj endeavoured, and not without success^ to expose the various heresies of the SoofFees, against whom it was the object of his life to direct the popular indignation. This sect, however, notwithstanding the efforts of their enemies to repress them, continued to increase in numbers: and Noor Aly Shah, with all those who adhered to him, were banished the kingdom. He returned some time afterwards, and a. d. 1797. was, we are informed, urged by his followers to create a tumult and A • H • 1212 • murder the tyrannical priest, who appeared determined upon his destruction. The mild spirit of Noor Aly Shah is said to have revolted from this extreme; and he again fled to Kerbelah, from whence he went towards Moossul. His avowed disciples were, at a. d. 1799. this period, about sixty thousand: but many more were supposed A,H - 1214 * to be secretly devoted to him ; and among the latter, a great majority were inhabitants of Persia. The danger that was to be apprehended a. d. isoo. from his fame, and the circumstances attending his death*, which A - H - 1215 - * The writer of his history states, that ' two inhabitants of Kermanshah, who were ' distinguished by an extraordinary appearance of zeal, dressed the dinner of Noor Aly « Shah on the day that he was suddenly attacked by those violent spasms, which, in aTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. .xxii. happened at this period, gave reason to suspect that he was poisoned; and from the circumstance of those who were supposed to have perpetrated this act being natives of Kermanshah, his disciples openly ascribed his death to the great opposer of the SoofFees, Aga Mahomed Aly, the mooshtdhed*, or high priest, of that city. Two of the devoted adherents of this teacher were afterwards taken up and sent in confinement to the reigning monarch, who commanded them to be sent to the high priest of Kermanshah, and empowered that determined enemy of the SoofFees to do what he chose with the offenders; the result was, that they were put to death f. ' few hours, terminated his existence. Their flight led all to suspect them of having ' poisoned him, Noor Aly died at nine o'clock on the morning of the tenth of Mohur- ' rum, A. H. 1215. He expired,' his biographer adds, ' close to the grave of the ' prophet Jonas, within a league of the City of Moossul.' * Aga Mahomed Aly (who is since dead,) used always to treat this accusation as a malignant calumny. He asserted, that the story of Noor Aly Shah being poisoned was an invention, and that he had died of the plague. t The letter from Futteh Aly Shah, the reigning monarch, to Aga Mahomed Aly, empowering the latter to put the two Sooffees to death, is a curious document. The following is its purport, as given in the MS. in my possession.

The latter class are very numerous; and they have probably been increased by the violent means which have been taken to defend the established religion. Every SoofFee that has suffered death is deemed a martyr: and those who revere their memory contend, that the cause of truth could never require to be supported by acts of cruel persecution. The great proportion of the SoofFees of Persia are not to be distinguished from the other part of the Mahomedan popu lation. They are in fact required, when in the first ranks of this mystic faith, to conform to the established religion: and the gradual and unseen manner in which men are led into infidelity, is justly stated, by Mahomedan divines, to be one of the greatest dangers that attend this delusive doctrine. In the above account of the SoofFees of Persia I have studiously ' that the sect be extirpated and put an end to, in order that the true faith may flourish. « Aga Mehdy and Meerza Mehdy have been deceiving the people about Hamadan, « who consider them as holy teachers: they were sent prisoners to our presence: we ' send them b y Ashraff Khan Yess^wul to be delivered over to you, whom we consider « as the wisest, the most learned, and most virtuous of all the oulamahs of our king- « dom.

To have entered into a minute detail of the opinions of every sect of this class would have been endless: a long catalogue might be given, even from the materials in my possession, of Sooffee saints : but the history of these ephemeral objects of regard and veneration, and a detail of their different Venets, would prove nothing beyond their equal igno rance of the great and inscrutable subject of which they profess a superior knowledge. I have carefully abstained in this chapter from attempting to give any description of the various and extraordinary shapes which this mystical faith has taken in India, where it has always flourished, and where it has been at times beneficial in uniting the opposite elements^ of the Hindoo and Mahomedan faith: nor have I ventured to offer any remarks on the similarity of many of the usages and opinions of the SoofFees of Persia to the Gnostics and other Christian sects, as also to those of some of the ancient philosophers of Greece. The principal Sooffee writers are familiar with the wisdom of Aristotle and of Plato: and their most celebrated works abound in quotations from the latter. It has been often assumed, that the knowledge and philosophy of ancient Greece were borrowed from the East: if they were, the debt has been repaid. The life and opinions of Pythagoras^ if translated into Persian, vyould be read at this moment as that of a Sooffee saint.

The Christian religion has at no period made any progress in Peisia, though that kingdom has been visited by many mis sionaries. There is, amid the mountains of Kurdistan, a small colony of Nestorians*, who are supposed to have resided there more than thirteen centuries. A Roman Catholic mission has been long established at Isfahan; and the Armenian colony who dwell in one of the suburbs of that capital, though they no longer enjoy the privileges bestowed upon them by Shah Abbas the Great, are still protected in the free exercise of their religion.

An Account of the Government of Persia; with Observations on the Judicial Revenue and Military Establishments of that Kingdom. It would be a waste of time to commence the description of the chap.xxiii Government of Persia with a discussion upon the nature of that authority upon which orthodox Mahomedans believe the right to govern others should be exercised. From the death of Mahomed, the right of every race of potentates who professed his religion has rested chiefly on the sword; but policy has often led to the sacred name of Imaum, or ' vicar of the prophet,' being bestowed on those who exercised sovereignty; and we may, perhaps, refer the com parative permanence of some of the greatest of the Mahomedan dynasties * to that increase of respect which they have derived from the union of spiritual and temporal power. None of the various races of kings who have reigned in Persia since the subversion of the authority of the Arabian caliphs, have ever been esteemed the head of the religion of that country. The SuiFavean monarchs were revered, and deemed holy-f, on account of their descent from a saint; but * Particularly the Caliphs of Arabia, and the present royal family of Constan tinople. t The sacred regard in which this race of kings were held by their subjects, has been before mentioned.

That power which, according to the belief of the Sheahs, was only legitimately exercised by the prophet, and the twelve Imaums, or descendants of Aly, is considered to belong to Mehdy, the last Imaum, who has disappeared, but who is believed still to exist It is exercised, during his concealment, or rather invisibility f, by those holy men who are raised, by popular suffrage, to the dignity of Mooshtdhed J, or ' high priestand who may be deemed at the head of the hierarchy of Persia. The Monarch of Persia has been pronounced one of the most absolute in the world ; and it has been shown that there is reason to believe his condition has been the same from the most early ages. The word of the King of Persia has ever been deemed a law; and he has probably never had any further restraint imposed upon the free exercise of his vast authority, than what has arisen from his regard for religion, his respect for established usages, his desire of reputation, and his fear of exciting an opposition that might given a very curious account of the opinion which the Persians entertained of their sanctity. To give the character of this feeling, it is enough to mention, that the water in which the Suffavean monarch washed was deemed a cure for all com plaints. * This belief of the Sheahs is in direct opposition to the tenets of the Soonees, who maintain that the Imaum should be always visible. They say, that he should neither conceal himself, nor be a common object.— D'O hsson , page 181. + The Persian word used is Ghaib; which means, ' latent, concealed, invisible.' % I write from several Persian MSS, of authority, and from the information of several able men of that country, with whom I conversed upon the subject.

There are no assembly* of cuap.xxiji nobles, no popular representatives, no ecclesiastical council of Oula- m4h f, in Persia. It is a majdm in that nation, that the king can do what he chooses, and that he is completely exempt from responsibility. He can appoint and dismiss ministers, judges, and officers of all ranks. He can also seize the property, or take away the life of any of his subjects; and it would be considered as treason to affirm that he was amenable to any checks, except those which may be imposed by his prudence, his wisdom, or his conscience. The exact limita tions to which he is subject cannot easily be defined, for they are equally dependant upon his personal disposition, and upon the character and situation of those under his rule; particularly of that part of the community who are, from their condition, the most exempt from the effects of arbitrary power. The ecclesiastical class, which includes the priests who officiate in the offices of religion, and those who expound the law as laid down in the Koran and the books of traditions, are deemed, by the defence- * The usages of the Monarchs of Tartary required that they should call a Coroultai, or 'assembly of chiefs,' upon all great occasions; and when the immediate descendants of these monarchs governed Persia, they probably complied with this custom : but the Coroultai appears to have been assembled less as a deliberative body, than to give force and effect to a measure upon which the prince who presided at it had previously re solved. N^dir Shah went through the mockery of consulting an assembly of this description before he usurped the crown.-—Vide Vol. II. page 62. t Oulamah signifies ' learned men;' and as the highest kind ofe'/w, or u science,' among the Mahomedans, is a knowledge of the Koran and traditions, those skilled in this branch of knowledge are termed Oulamah; which, in the Turkish empire, describes a body of priests, who, acting under the mufti, or ' chief pontiff of the empire,' both control and support the power of the grand signior.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. less part of the population, as the principal shield between them and the absolute authority of their monarch. The superiors of this class enjoy a consideration that removes them from those personal appre hensions to which almost all others are subject. The people have a right to appeal to them in all ordinary cases, where there ap pears an outrage against law and justice, unless when the disturbed state of the country calls for the exercise of military power. The merchants of Persia are a numerous and wealthy class; and there is no part of the community that has enjoyed, through all the distractions with which that kingdom has been afflicted, and under the worst princes, more security, both in their persons and property. The reason is obvious: their traffic is essential to the revenue; op pression cannot be partially exercised upon them, for the plunder of one would alarm all: confidence would be banished, and trade cease: besides, the merchants of Persia correspond with those of the adjacent countries; and the king who ventured to attack this class, must consent to have his name consigned to disgrace and obloquy in every quarter*. The citizens of great towns, who have no further protection than what they find in that respect which the absolute monarch of the country is disposed to pay to law and usage, and to the character of their priests and magistrates, are much more exposed to the effects of * Notwithstanding these claims to favour and protection, contributions, in the shape of loans, have often been raised upon this class: and fines are occasionally levied, on granting or securing to them commercial privileges.

These tribes may, in fact, be considered as a camp of soldiers, who are only exposed to the common vicissitudes of the military life, and who are formidable from the character of that social union which causes them to entertain common feelings of attachment and of resent ment. The power of the monarch over this class of his subjects may be said to be liable to the same fluctuations as that which he exercises over the principal tributaries of the kingdom, whose sub mission or disobedience is always determined by the weakness or strength of his authority. The Kings of Persia are considered as completely absolute in all that relates to their own family. They may employ their sons in the public service, or immure them in a haram; deprive them of sight, or of life, as their inclination or their policy may dictate. It was the practice of the Suffavean kings, after the time of Shah Abbas the Great, to confine the princes of the blood; and those not intended for the succession were usually deprived of sight*, that they might not have it in their power to disturb the peace of the country. The successor to the throne, though fixed upon by the king, was seldom declared till the moment of his elevation : but the rank of the mother was, according to the custom of that family, * Chardin, Vol. V. page 242, states, that ' these princes were deprived of sight at ' all ages.' He gives a shocking description of the operation of taking out the eyes, which appears to be the same as is now practised. It had been the custom to sear the eyes with a hot iron; but a discovery that this was not effectual, led to the cruel method of taking them out altogether with a sharp pointed instrument.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap.xxiii of no consequence : and the son of a slave (if it suited the pleasure of his royal father,) had as good pretensions to the crown, as the descendant of the highest born princess, who boasted the honour of marriage with the sovereign*. The reigning family of Persia have adopted usages more congenial to the feelings of the military tribe to which they belong. A number of the sons of the present monarch are employed in the chief governments of the kingdom: and a prince, not the eldest of the king's sons, but whose mother is of a high family in the Kujur tribe, has been declared the heir of the crown, and has, for many years, enjoyed a consideration and exercised a charge suited to his high destination. It appears, there fore, that there is no fixed rule for the treatment of the princes of the blood royal in Persia; but in all periods the members of his family have been entirely dependant upon the monarch. Their condition is regulated by his feelings, or his policy: and he is considered by his subjects to have even a more absolute authority over them, than over his domestics, courtiers, and ministers. The sons of the ruler of Persia have in fact no rights that are either recognised by law or by custom. No mediating power can interpose between them and their parent and sovereign. Born on a precipice, they are every moment in danger of destruction, and are alike subject to fall by their virtues as their crimes: for the jealousy of a despot is exces sive ; and he usually views with increased suspicion and alarm every action of those who are placed nearest to his throne. From what has been stated, we may assume that the power of the King of Persia is, by usage, absolute over the property and * Chardin, Vol. V. page 240.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. lives of his conquered enemies, his rebellious subjects*, his own family, his ministers; public officers, civil and military; and all the numerous train of his immediate servants and domestics: and that he may punish any person of the above classes without exami nation or formal procedure of any kind whatever: but in all other cases that are capital, the forms prescribed by law and custom are observed : and the monarch only commands, when the evidence has been examined, and the law declared, that the sentence shall be put in execution, or that the condemned culprit shall be pardoned. There are, no doubt, instances in which the king exceeds that prerogative which usage gives him: but these are rare; and when they occur, it is generally under a pretext that the offence is dangerous to the person or to the power of the king. It is, indeed, obvious, that the hierarchy of the country could not maintain its respect or popularity, if the law, of which it is the organ, was openly contemned and set aside. But we cannot understand the character of the power of the monarch without constant reference to the actual condi tion of the empire he governs. Persia, in its most tranquil state, Contains tributaries, who reluctantly acknowledge his authority, ajid against whom he is annually compelled to employ his troops ; moun tain tribes, who subsist by plundering their less warlike neighbours; ambitious nobles, who are eager to establish their independence; and even the more peaceable part of the population have been of late so habituated to change, that they are prompt to obey any new master whom the fortune of the hour places over them.

II. 3 K434 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap.xxiii a country must be dreaded, or his power could not be effective; and we consequently find, that some of the monarchs of Persia who have been stigmatized by travellers on account of their cruelty, are those under whom that country has been most prosperous. The exaggerated accounts spread of their barbarity has arisen, in a great degree, from the king himself ordering all executions, and from the court of his palace being often the scene of bloodshed. But a practice, at which we shudder, is deemed by the Persians themselves essential to the preservation of the royal power. It adds, they believe, in a very great degree to that impression of terror which it is necessary to make upon the turbulent and refrac tory classes of the community.

At an early hour in the morning the principal minis ters and secretaries attend the king, make reports upon what has occurred, and receive his commands. After this audience, he pro ceeds to his public levee, which takes place almost every day, and continues about an hour and a half. At this levee, which is attended by the princes, ministers, and the officers of the court, all affairs which are wished to be made public are transacted; rewards are * There were a few instances among the weakest and most depraved of the Suffa- vean family, of the reigning monarch confining himself entirely to the palace, and communicating with none except favourite eunuchs: but these remarkable exceptions only prove the general rule by which the Kings of Persia are guided, in the execution of their sovereign functions.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 435 given, punishments commanded; and the king expresses aloud those chap.xxiii sentiments of displeasure or approbation which he wishes to be pro- mulgated. When this public levee is over, he adjourns to a council chamber, where one or two hours are given to his personal favourites, and to his ministers. After the morning has been passed in this manner, he retires to his inner apartments; and in the evening he again holds a levee, less public than that of the morning, and transacts business with his ministers and principal officers of state. The usual occupations of the Monarch of Persia are liable to no interruption but what proceeds from illness, the pursuit of field sports, or occasional exercise on horseback. When in camp, his habits of occupation are the same as in his capital; and we may pronounce, that he is from six to seven hours every day in public; during which time he is not only seen by, but accessible to, a great number of persons of all ranks. It is impossible that a monarch, whom custom requires to mix so much with his subjects, can be ignorant of their condition; and this knowledge must, unless his character be very perverse, tend to promote their happiness. It is impossible to give an exact description of the duties which Dudes of the the prime minister* of a King of Persia has to perform: these Primeminister depend upon the degree of favour and confidence he enjoys, and upon the activity and energy, or indolence and incompetency, of his sovereign. He is usually deemed the medium through which political negotiations, and all affairs that relate to the general # The Persian title of this officer is Hamiid-u-Doulah, which means « the trusted .« of the state.'

He receives and intro- duces foreign ambassadors, corresponds with the principal governors of provinces; and when he is a decided favourite he exercises a great influence over all the branches of the government. The prime minister is sometimes placed at the head of every department*; and at others, this great power is divided, and a separate minister has charge of the public revenue -f. These arrangements rest solely with the king, upon whose favour the ministers of his court are dependent from hour to hour, not only for the authority they exercise, but for the preservation of their property and their lives, which may be said to be always in peril. Their danger in creases with their charge; and their time is incessantly occupied in personal attendance upon their sovereign, in the intricacies of private intrigues, or the toils of public business. Men must be very efficient before they are competent to fill such stations, and they are generally selected on account of the reputation they have attained in inferior offices. It is a maxim of policy not to raise a nobleman of high birth and rank to the station of prime minister. Perhaps few of that class in Persia are equal to the duties: but if they were, it would not be deemed wise to trust men with the use of the king's name, and of the royal seal, who might employ them to further their own plans of ambition, and who could not be cast down without # The late Hajee Ibrahim, during the whole period that he was prime minister to Aga Mahomed Khan, presided over every department of the state.

As the administration is in general con- stituted, the disgrace or execution of a minister creates no sensation whatever. There are instances of a departure from this policy, but they are too rare to be considered otherwise than as exceptions to a general rule.

It is rare, however, that any of the officers who fill these departments enjoy any extensive influence, though it is from this class that the ministers of the crown are often selected. A great change has taken place in the whole frame of the Court of Persia since the SufFavean kings occupied the throne. Some of the monarchs of that race were accustomed to pass a great part of their time in the haram. The consequence was, that they fell under the dominion of women and of eunuchs. The latter sometimes were promoted to the first stations in the kingdom, and always exercised a commanding influence. The chiefs of warlike tribes, who have, since the downfal of this family, filled the throne of Persia, have not yet changed the manly habits of their ancestors for usages of so * The Moonshee-ul-Moom&amp;lik, or secretary of state; and the Mustooffees, or counsellors, are among the first in rank : their seal is necessary to every royal mandate. t These offices are termed Dufter Kh&amp;nah, or chambers of records.438 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap.xxiii degenerate a character, and eunuchs are very seldom employed beyond the walls of the haram^. The chief officers of the king's household, those who preside over the ceremonies of the court, and his domestics, have not necessarily any official concern with the affairs of government: but as they often, particularly the latter, become great favourites, and enjoy more of the personal confidence of their master than his ministers; they attain, in an indirect manner, a considerable influence, if not authority, in the state. Law of Persia. The law of Persia, like that of all Mahomedan nations, is founded upon the Koran and the traditions. From this circumstance, the duties of the priest and the judge are combined ; and the hierarchy has attained great power, from the priests being the administrators of the sacred law, and having in that capacity the ability to shield the people, in some degree, from those incessant attacks to which they are exposed from the violence and rapacity of their sovereigns and rulers, Administra- Justice is administered in Persia in two distinct modes; regarding tion of justice. 1 , . . which a few observations will be useful, not merely to explain their origin, but to elucidate those causes which lead to their frequent collision. The written law, which Persia has in common with every Mahomedan country, is termed Sherr^h. It is founded on the Koran, and the Soona, or oral traditions : but, since the establish^ ment of the faith of the Sheahs as the national religion in Persia, the learned men of the ecclesiastical order, who administer this law, have rejected all traditions which come from the three first caliphs, * I have known only two or three instances of eunuchs being employed in situa tions of trust during the present reign : I however observed, that they were treated with uncommon attention and deference.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 439 or from others whom they deem the personal enemies of Aly, and chap.xxiii the family of the Prophet. By the theory of a Mahomedan government there should be no other courts of justice except those established for the administration of the Sherrah, or written law; but in Persia there is another branch of judicature, which is termed Urf, a word which means known or customary; and the name is referrible to the principle that should govern the secular magistrates by whom it is administered, who ought to decide all cases brought before them according to precedent, or custom. This law, if it can be termed such, is never written ; for Mahomedans can have no written laws but the Koran and traditions. It varies in different parts of the empire, because it has reference to local as well as common usages. The king, as temporal monarch, is at the head of the Urf, or customary law; which may indeed be considered, through all its branches, an emana tion from the royal authority, although it is administered upon principles that are grounded on a professed regard for the habits and prejudices of the people. There can be no doubt respecting the origin of this system The rulers and chiefs of Persia, though converts to the Maho medan faith, have neither been disposed to sacrifice at the shrine of the religion they embraced, their temporal power, nor the laws and usages which they had inherited from their forefathers; and while they submitted to those ordinances which were deemed sacred and indispensable, they have preserved, as more conformable to their prejudices, and to their system of government, the Urf, or customary law; but the administration of this law has always varied with the power and disposition of the monarch. There have been periodsTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap.xxiii in the history of Persia^ when the religious zeal of the sovereign has caused almost every case to be referred to the ecclesiastical judges; and, at others, the whole authority has been vested in the secular magistrates We may safely conclude that the latter are prone to encroach upon the privileges of the former; and as they possess power, they can seldom be at a loss for pretexts to justify their proceedings. The ecclesiastical order pretend that the Sherr^h, or divine law, which they administer, should take cognizance of all cases whatever; while the courts of IJrf, or customary law, supported by the temporal power, have succeeded in limiting their functions to the settlement of disputes about religious ceremonies, inheritance, marriage, divorce, contracts, sales, and all civil cases; while it reserves to itself the decision on all proceedings respecting murder, theft, fraud, and every crime that is capital, or that can be called a breach of the public peace J.

The lands with ciiAP.xxm 7 which the different mosques and charitable buildings were endowed, produced a very great revenue; and the office instituted for the management of these funds acted entirely under the direction of the Sudder-ul-Suddoor, or Nawab, as he was sometimes called, in allusion to his office as lieutenant of the holy Imaum. The policy of Shah Abbas the Great made him desire to abolish an office which vested so great a power in the individual who filled it; and on the occur rence of the death of the chief pontiff no successor was nominated. But his grandson and successor, Shah Suffee, who feared to perse vere in this measure, adopted the expedient of appointing two persons to this high dignity. He thought by dividing the power to diminish the influence of those by whom it was enjoyed. One of these pontiffs was distinguished by the name of the Sudder-ul- Suddoor-e-Khas, which signifies ' the personal, or King's Chief 'Pontiff;' the other was called Sudder-ul-Suddoor-e Aum, or ' the Chief Pontiff of the People/' The former took rank of the latter, though their duties were nearly the same. N^dir Shah not only abolished this office* altogether, but seized, as has been related, the lands appropriated to the support of ecclesiastical establishments, in order to pay his troops. These lands have never been fully restored ; * N&amp;dir Shah, when he abolished the office, granted a small pension to the person who held it. His descendants retain this provision and the title of Nawab. In 1800 I dined in company with the present representative of the family. He had come from Yezd to Teheran. Though he had no station, and no duties to perform, he was treated with great respect. All the first nobles and ministers of the kingdom were of the party when I met him, and all concurred in giving the seat of honour in the assembly to the nominal high priest. vol. ii. 3 lTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA* chap.xxih and the hierarchy of Persia is not likely to regain that wealth and power which it once possessed. The order of chief priests, who are named Mooshtahed *, have * The word Moosht&amp;lied, which is the active participle of an Arabic verb, may 'be translated ' the giver of evidence.*' This order of high priests existed, though with less authority than they now enjoy r during the reign of the Suffavean monarchs. The learned Kcempfer has given a very good description of them. He observes, that ' in order to captivate the affections, and attract the veneration of the people, ' who alone hate the right of conferring this title, they (the mooshtaheds) affect ' exterior sanctity, and the most rigid frugality ; they shun honours and amusements, ' and all species of frivolities; their only discourse is on holy and edifying subjects, and ' all their thoughts appear directed to heaven ; they preach the most mild doctrines; ' they show the greatest patience with their disciples, whom they correct, not only ' without harshness, but with exemplary moderation ; they speak little, and are very ' sententious; their answers are full of unction, and the odour of the saint seems spread ' around them ; they wear a white cloak, wove of camels' or goats' hair; their head is ' covered with a high white cap, which gives to their countenance a pallid and thin ' appearance. When a Moosht^ihed is mounted on his mule, his eyes are always cast ' down ; two servants are his only attendants, both of whom walk ; the one guides the ' animal upon which the holy man rides, the other carries his book. These high ' priests,' (this author continues,) ' often recite in the mosques much longer prayers ' than those usually said by the faithful, and afterwards retiring into a corner, they ' preach and give pious instructions to the multitude, who are in ecstasy with their sublime devotion. It is with these holy tricks,' says Kcempfer, ' that they captivate ' men's affections, establish a reputation for sanctity, and obtain from the silent ' suffrages of the people a species of supreme pontificate. But it must,' he adds, ' be acknowledged they do not easily attain success in this career of hypocrisy.

I cannot but express my own opinion, after making this quotation, that the learned and observing author, from whom it is taken, is rather uncharitable in deeming theTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 443 always existed in Persia; but since the abolition of the station chap.xxiii of Sudder-ul-Suddoor, they have attained a greater degree of power than they before possessed. It is not easy to describe persons who fill no office, receive no appointment, who have no specific duties, but who are called, from their superior learning, piety and virtue, by the silent but unanimous suffrage of the inhabitants of the country in which they live, to be their guides in religion, and their protectors against the violence and oppression of their rulers, and who receive from those by whose feelings they are elevated a respect and duty which lead the proudest kings to join the popular voice, and to pretend, if they do not feel, a veneration for the man who has attained this sacred rank. There are seldom more than three or four priests of the dignity of Mooshl^hed in Persia*. Their conduct is expected to be exemplary, and to show no worldly bias; neither must they connect themselves with the king or the officers of government. They seldom depart from that character whole life of the moosht&amp;hed to be a course of hypocrisy. Mahomedans are often bigots, but seldom hypocrites ; and a very attentive observation of the character and conduct of the principal mooshtaheds in Persia, has led me to form a very different conclusion regarding their general character, than that made by Kqempfer. Several of those with whom I have been acquainted have appeared to me men of sincere piety and goodness; and their chief duty, which is to defend the weak against the strong, appear? singularly calculated to inspire and preserve sentiments and habits of virtue and rectitude. * When I was in Persia, there were, I think, five of these high priests : Aga Ma homed Aly, of Kermanshah, (who has been before mentioned,) Meerza Abool Hussein, of Koom, and Hajee Meer Mahomed Hussein, of Isfahan, were the most celebrated. Hajee Syud Hussein, of Kazveen, had died five years before 1 first visited Persia : but his memory was so highly venerated, that his house continued to be considered a sanctuary.444 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. ciiap.xxiii to which they owe their rank. The reason is obvious; the moment they deviate, the charm is broken which constitutes their power; men no longer solicit their advice or implore their protection ; nor can they hope to see the monarch of the country courting popu larity by walking to their humble dwellings, and placing them on the seat of honour when they condescend to visit his court. When a moosht^hed dies, his successor is always a person of the most eminent rank in the ecclesiastical order; and, though he may be pointed out to the populace by others of the same class seeking him as an associate, it is rare to hear of any intrigues being employed to obtain this enviable dignity. The moosht^heds of Persia exercise a great, though undefined, power over the courts of Sherr&amp;h, or written law, the judges of which constantly submit cases to their superior knowledge; and their sentence is deemed irrevocable, unless by a moosht^hed whose learning and sanctity are of acknowledged higher repute than that of the person by whom judgment has been pronounced. But the benefits which the inhabitants of Persia derive from the influence of these high priests is not limited to their occasional aid of the courts of justice; the law is respected on account of the character of its ministers; kings fear to attack the decrees of tribunals over which they may be said to preside, and frequently endeavour to obtain popularity by referring cases to their decision. The sove reign, when no others dare approach him, cannot refuse to listen to a revered mooshtMied when he becomes an intercessor for the guilty. The habitations of this high order of priesthood are deemed sanctuaries for the oppressed; and the hand of despotic power is sometimes taken off a city, because the monarch will not offendTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. a mooshtdhed, who has chosen it for his residence, but who refuses chap.xxiii to dwell amid violence and injustice.

There is a shaikh-ul-islam to every principal city in Persia: he is nominated by the king, from whom he receives a liberal salary: but it is a station in which the desire and wishes of the inhabitants are almost invariably consulted, and one to which the individual is usually promoted, from a general belief of his superior sanctity and knowledge. These officers often attain a respect hardly inferior to that enjoyed by the mooshtdhed. They studiously avoid any open connexion with men in power; as even the appearance of such an intercourse would lose them the respect and confidence of the people, who are naturally very jealous of their independence and integrity. In large cities there is aCauzee *, or The Cauzee. judge, under the shaikh-ul-islA,m; and the latter has in general the further aid of a council of moollahs, or learned men, many of whom give their services gratuitously, in the hope of increasing their reputa tion, or of recommending themselves to notice and employment. In the lesser towns there is only a cauzee; and in villages they have seldom more than an inferior moollah, who can read a few sentences of Arabic, which entitles him to perform the ceremonies at a marriage or funeral, to make out common deeds, and to decide on plain * This officer was originally supreme civil judge in all Mahomedan countries: he still retains great powers in Turkey, though under the raufty: and among the Maho medan states in India he is the chief judge; but in Persia the cauzee is considered as under the shaikh-ul-islam in all cities where that high office exists.446 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA.

When subjects of intricacy occur, this officer refers to the cauzee of the neighbouring town, by whom the cause is often carried before the court of the shaikh-ul-isl4m, or supreme judge of the provincial capital. The Mufty. There is also in Persian courts an officer who bears the name of Mufty, but who has none of those great powers which are associated with that title in Turkey. His duty is more to prepare an exposition of the case before the court, and to aid with his advice, than to decide: but as this office requires a man of learning, his opinion often influences the judgment of his superiors. The lower ranks of the priesthood in Persia are seldom entitled to a share of that praise which has been bestowed upon some of the superior branches of this order. They neither enjoy, nor can expect, popular fame, as their situations are not permanent; and they seldom rise by gradation to the higher ranks of their profession. They are exposed to great temptation; and receive, with their office, but a very limited income. We can, therefore, believe that there is truth in those accusations which represent them as being in general as ignorant as they are corrupt and bigoted. The art and venality of the cauzees and moollahs of Persia are often noticed by the writers of that kingdom: and the character of this class has almost always been drawn in the harshest colours by European travellers. One eminent Christian merchant*, who resided many years in Persia, and who enlightened Europe by his observa tions on that country, states, that ' nothing but the establishment ' of the Urf, or customary law, which is administered by the Chardin.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. ^ si secular magistrates, could enable a person, not of the Maho- charxxiii ' medan faith, to carry on any commercial transactions in Persia; &lt;£ as the bigotry of the priests, and the strict letter of the only law ' which they administer, that of the Koran and the traditions, would ' operate to deprive him of every hope of justice/' This writer asserts, that ' when an application was made to the courts of ' Sherrah against a bankrupt, that he was so sheltered* under its ' forms and prescriptive laws, that even his goods could not be ' seized for the payment of his debts: but if the suit/' he adds, was transferred before the lay magistrate, who decided by the customary law, it was only necessary to authenticate the demands against him to obtain an order for the seizure and sale of his pro- ' perty to satisfy them/' The Urf, or customary law, which is administered by the kingf, his lieutenants, the rulers of provinces, governors of cities, lay magis- * The Mahomedan law against debtors is sufficiently severe; and the creditor (if a Mahomedan,) has every means he could desire of recovering his property: but the letter of the Sherrah, or written law, is in no point favourable to what are termed in its language ' unbelievers:' and we can believe that the bigoted ecclesiastics, by whom it was administered, were not even disposed to grant those the benefit of the law. t In the time of the Suffavean dynasty, we learn from Kcempfer, Chardin, and others, that there was always a Dewan Beggee, or chief of the council, who superin tended this department. That department does not, at this moment, exist. It was one of great power and influence : and the late Monarchs of Persia have probably been jealous of giving it to one of their principal nobles. The late Soliman Khan Kujur was for a day styled Dewan Beggee, in order to adjust a ceremony when I first went to the Court of Persia; and it was alleged; that the person holding that high office represented the person of the king.448 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap.xxiii trates of towns, managers and collectors of districts, and heads of villages, aided by all the different subordinate officers who act under their authority, bears some resemblance, in its cognisance of petty offences, to that kind of authority which, in better ordered commu nities, is vested in magistrates of police: but the magistrates in Persia always exercise the chief local authority, and consequently are above the law, instead of being checked by it. Their decrees are instantly enforced by the strong hand of power. They are prompt and arbi trary in their decisions: and as they seldom bestow much time in the consideration of evidence, they are continually liable to commit injustice, even if their intentions are pure. The principal check upon them is the dread of superiors, to whom the injured may always appeal: but it is easier to explain the duties, than to describe the conduct of men, who regulate their actions by the varying disposition of the despot of the day, and are active and just, or corrupt and cruel, as he happens to be vigilant and virtuous, or avaricious and tjTannical. The lowest of those intrusted with the administration of the Urf, or customary law, hear complaints of all kinds, and summon evidence: and even the heads of villages are allowed to inflict slight punishment, or impose small fines; but if the crime be serious, the delinquent is sent to the person that holds the office of collector and magistrate of the district*, whose power is more extensive: and when the case, either from the magnitude of the property concerned, the rank of the parties, or the heinousness of the crime, appears above the * This person is called Zaubit.

(Collector's cognizance, he refers it to the governor of the province, chap.xxiii who is generally competent to decide on all cases that do not affect life. But the power to put to death is seldom delegated by the king, unless in cases when a country is in rebellion, or when the govern ment is committed to one of the blood royal. In all other circum stances, when an example is necessary, the proof of the guilt of the criminal, taken, according to legal forms, before the court of Sherrdh, or ' written law,' is sent to court, and a royal mandate is trans mitted for his execution. The lay magistrates of Persia always hold their courts of justice publicly, which undoubtedly operates as a salutary check upon their proceedings. These courts are sometimes very tumultuous, though the judge is always aided by a crowd of inferior officers, whose duty is to preserve order. The females, who attend these courts, are often the most vociferous; for it is not permitted that the servants of the magistrates should silence them with those blows which, in cases of disturbance, they liberally inflict upon ail others. The jurisdiction of the courts of written and customary law in Persia, neither is, nor can be, from the constitution of the latter, clearly defined. The sovereign and his ministers desire to promote this confusion of authority, which adds to their power and emolu ment. But though in civil and criminal cases, appeals, or rather complaints, are carried from one of these courts to the other, all deeds, contracts, marriages, and divorces, must be drawn up by the officers of the Sherrdh, or ' written lawand their decisions on such points are received as evidence in the court of the lay magistrate; who is also in the habit of continually referring to them all cases vol . n. 3 M450 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chapjcxiii which he desires (either from personal * or political reasons) should be decided by their authority: and, in criminal cases, where a regular procedure is adopted, the chief judge of the court of Sherr^h pronounces sentence according to the decrees of the sacred law. The decisions of the courts of Persia, whether those of written or customary law, are speedily obtained; and a suit in them is attended with little apparent cost, though considerable sums are often given in bribes. The administration of the customary law, or Urf, is more summary than that of Sherr^h, because it is more arbitrary. All forms and delays of law arise out of a respect for persons and pro perty that is unknown to this branch of the administration of justice in Persia; which always imitates, in its decisions, the promptness of that despotic authority from which it proceeds, and by which it is supported. It has been already stated, that the King of Persia deems himself vested with an authority independent of the law; and considers that he can, from the prerogative of his high condition, take the life or seize the property of any one of his subjects: but it has been shown that the exercise of his absolute power is practically limited. In all cases where he does not personally decide, or delegate his arbitrary authority to others, the criminal law of Persia is administered in a manner conformable to what is laid down in the Koran. Theft may # In any case where a lay magistrate conceived his decision might involve him in dispute with any person of rank or influence, or when he feared he might, by the punish ment of a man of a tribe, excite a dangerous spirit of revenge, he would certainly refer the case to the court of Shen&amp;h.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 451 be forgiven* and murder compounded, if the party from whom the chap.xxiii property is stolen, or the legal heir of the person that has been slain, are disposed to mercy. Mutilation for theft, though commanded in the Koran, is rarely practised : but the king often inflicts capital punishment on those who are convicted of having stolen to any large amount. When a man or woman is murdered -f*, the moment the person by whom the act was perpetrated is discovered, the heir at law to the deceased demands vengeance for the blood. Witnesses are examined; and, if the guilt be established, the criminal is delivered into his hands, to deal with as he chooses. It is alike legal for him to forgive him, to accept a sum of money as the price of blood, or to put him to death. This barbarous usage of committing the execu tion of the law into the hands of the injured individual, is still prac tised in Persia. It is only a few years agof that the English * The Koran states, « If a man or woman steal, cut off their hands, in retribution ' for that which they have committed:' but adds, in a subsequent sentence, « Who ever shall repent, after his iniquity, and amend, verily God will be turned unto him; ' ^ God is inclined to forgive, and to be merciful.' It is from the spirit of the latter passage that commentators have inferred the right of forgiveness in those injured. f In all cases of murder Mahomed has expressly commanded the law of retalia tion. « The free shall die for the free, the servant for the servant, and a woman for ' a woman but he adds, ' He whom his brother shall forgive, may be prosecuted, ' and obliged to make satisfaction, according to what is just; and a fine shall be set ' upon him with humanity. This is indulgence from your Lord, and mercy: and he « who shall transgress after this, by killing the murtherer, shall be grievously punished.' — S ale's Koran, Vol. I. page 30. Manslaughter is, according to the Koran, to be exp^ted by releasing a believer from slavery, by paying a fine to the relations of the deceased, or by giving alms. % I received the account of this transaction from Mr. Hankey Smith, late British resident at Abusheher.452 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap.xxiii resident at Abusheher saw three persons delivered into the hands of the relations of those whom they had murdered. They led their victims bound to the burial ground, where they put them to death: but the part of the execution which appeared of most importance^ was to make the infant children of the deceased stab the murderers with knives, and imbrue their little hands in the blood of those who had slain their father. The youngest princes of the blood that could hold a dagger were made to stab the assassins of the late Aga Maho med Khan when they were executed; and it has been before men tioned*, that the successor of Nddir Shah sent one of the murderers of that monarch to the females of his haram, who, we are told, were delighted to become his executioners. In the time of the Suffavean kings, the court of the Dewan Beggee, or ' supreme criminal judge/' not only passed its decisions upon the cases of murder and robbery which occurred in the metro polis, but over the whole kingdomf. This court, we are told, took particular cognizance of four crimes : the knocking out of a tooth,, or an eye, cases of rape, and of murder J. Other crimes, the same author states, were judged on the spot where they were committed, by the Haukim, or ' chief magistrate/' who referred all civil suits to the Sherr^h, or ' court of written law but it is added, that it was the peculiar privilege of nobles, public ministers, and all king s guests, including ambassadors and envoys from foreign states, to have every suit they instituted, or that was brought against them, tried only in the court of the Dewan Beggee, or ' supreme judge.'

This is still the practice; but the high office of Dewan Beggee no longer exists. Its powers are exercised by the monarch; who, however, in most instances where he has ap pointed one of his sons to the government of a province, has vested him with the power of pronouncing and carrying into exe cution the sentence of death upon convicted criminals, as well as of taking cognizance of, and punishing all other crimes, formerly noticed by the court of the Dewan Beggee, or ' chief criminal ' judge*.' The mode, as well as the degree, of punishment of offences, in cases decided by the Sherr^h, or ' written law,' is the same in Persia as in all other Mahomedan countries: but when the sentence is pro nounced by the king, or by those governors or military commanders to whom he has delegated his authority, the punishment varies ac cording to the disposition of the arbitrary will by which it is inflicted. For lesser offences, fines, flogging, and the bastinado, are the most common punishments. Torture is seldom used, but to make men reveal hidden treasures. The inhuman practice of taking out the eyes has long disgraced Persia. The objects of this barbarity are usually persons who have aspired to, or are supposed likely to aspire to the throne. It is also inflicted upon chiefs of tribes, whom it is desirable to deprive of power, without putting them to death; and * There was formerly, and is still, an officer in the courts of justice called Yakeel- ul-Raya, or ' the advocate of the people.' The very continuance of the name of this officer, even though his duties may be dormant, proves that there is a desire to have the reputation of attention to justice.454 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap.xxiii instances occur, as has been related, where this punishment is inflicted on the male inhabitants of a city that has rebelled, in order to strike terror by a dreadful example. The common mode of putting criminals to death in Persia, is by strangling, by decapitation, or by stabbing; but, in cases of enormity, or where there is a desire to make an im pression of terror*, or to gratify a passion of revenge, inventive cruelty endeavours to discover new ways of adding to the sufferings of its victims. These are sometimes doomed to have their existence terminated by protracted torture; at others, are empaled, or have their limbs torn asunder by the elastic rebound of the branches of trees that have been bent for the purpose 'f*. An instance has been given of a barbarous chief associating the idea of a luxurious enjoy ment with the horrors of the most cruel death, by making a garden of his enemies J; and the history of Persia abounds with examples too shocking to be related, of tyrants glutting their vengeance, by subjecting their enemies, before they granted them the mercy of death, to the most shameless insults, and horrid injuries. In Persia women are seldom publicly executed \\; nor can their crimes, from their condition in society, be often of a nature to demand * I find in Mr. Jukes's Journal an account of a dreadful punishment that took place at Teheran, when he was there in 1810. A slave had poisoned the family he served. Though they all recovered, by the instant application of remedies, the man was fully convicted, and sentenced by the king to be hung by the heels in the common market-place, and cut up in the same manner as a butcher does the carcass of a sheep, but he was denied the mercy shown to that animal, of having his throat cut before he was quartered. f Vide Vol. I. page 73. $ Vide Vol. II. page 138. lj When the case is very aggravated, an example is made. Some time ago, at Tabreez, a woman, who had poisoned her husband, was cast headlong from a high towel by the common executioner.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. ^ such examples: but they are exposed to all the violence and injustice chap.xxiii of domestic tyranny; and innocent females are too often included in the punishment of their husbands and fathers; particularly where those are of high rank. Instances frecjuently occur where women are tortured to make them reveal the concealed wealth of which they are supposed to have a knowledge; and when a nobleman, or minister, is put to death, it is not unusual to give away his wives and daughters as slaves; and sometimes (though rarely) they are bestowed on the lowest classes in the community *. This usage is defended on the ground of the necessity of making terrible examples of men who fill high stations; and it is argued, that nothing is so likely to deter others from equal guilt, as the dread of having their families exposed to similar dishonour: but no reasoning can recon cile our minds to a practice, which is at once infamous, inhuman, and unjust; and which marks, perhaps, beyond all others that have been stated, the wanton atrocity of a despotic and barbarous power-f*. The king nominates the Beglerbegs or governors of provinces, Begierbegs, and Haukims or governors of cities, who are not required, as a Srog^, matter of course, to be natives of the place of their government; bythe nor is it necessary that the Darogah, or lieutenant of police, who acts immediately under the Haukim or governor, should be so: * There are instances of the wives of men of high rank being given to mule drivers. t The inhabitants of the Turkish provinces in the vicinity of Persia, who are far from being civilized, have a right, from their opposite usage of the females of criminals of rank, to speak of this practice with horror and indignation.456 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap.xxiii but the Kalanter, or chief magistrate of the city, and the Kut- khodahs, or magistrates of different wards, though nominated by Kalanter and Kut-khodah the ki n g j mus t as necessarily be selected from the most respectable people. by 16 natives of the city, as the members of the corporation of any city or town in England. Though these officers are not formally elected, we may assert that the voice of the people always points them out: and it may be further stated, that if the king should appoint a magistrate disagreeable to the citizens, he could not perform his duties, which require that all the weight he derives from personal consideration should aid the authority of office. In small towns or villages the voice of the inhabitants in the nomination of their Kut-khodah, or head*, is still more decided; and if one is named whom they do not approve, their incessant clamour produces either his voluntary resignation or removal. These facts are important; for there cannot be a privilege more essential to the welfare of a people, than that of choosing or even influencing the choice of their magistrates. It is true that these cannot always screen them from the hand of power, and they are often compelled to become the instruments of oppression; but still the popularity with their fellow-citizens, which caused their elevation, continues to be their strength; and in the common exercise of their duties they ex hibit every attention to their comfort, happiness, and interests. It is important to state in this place, that in every city or town of any * The head of the village is sometimes called Reis, which is an Arabic phrase, and signifies the head person, or chief m authority.

This person is chosen by the com munity to which he belongs, and is appointed by the king. He is seldom removed from his situation, except on the complaint of those whose representative he is deemed; and even they must bring for ward and substantiate charges of neglect or criminal conduct, before he is degraded from the elevation to which their respect had raised him. It must be obvious that no general description of the administra- Administra tion of justice can comprehend the various communities which form Iw !l jus ' ucc ainong the population of an empire like Persia. It has feeen before men- thewa ' de,&gt; ing tribes. tioiled that the military part of the inhabitants of that country are divided into tribes, who derive their origin from different nations. The Turkish from Turkistan, orTartary; the Arabs from Arabia; and the original tribes of Persia, consisting of Kurdish, Lac, Zund, and many others. All these tribes, though speaking different lan guages, have nearly similar customs. They usually dwell in tents; subsist upon their flocks, or the chase; and change their residence with the season. The system of the internal government of the whole of this race of men is nearly the same. They profess the Maho- medan religion; and, consequently, acknowledge the authority of the written law as laid down in the Koran and the traditions. During the reign of the Suffavean kings, the Sudder-ul-Suddoor, * This person is termed Wasta-asanaf, or ' the mediator or representative of his class.' vol. ii. 3 n, to THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 45o chap.xxiii or ' chief pontiff,' appointed a Cauzee, or judge, to every one of t ^ e principal tribes of Persia; and the power of this person formed a considerable check upon the chief of the tribe. NMir Shah, when he abolished the office of Sudder-ul-Suddoor, changed this system; and the only persons of a religious character who at present remain with the tribes are moollahs, who can perform marriage ceremonies, give names to children, or repeat the prayers at a funeral. In any cases of importance that they have occasion to refer to the courts of Sherr^h, they apply to the cauzee, or shaikh-ul-isl&amp;m, of the nearest town. The customary law of these tribes differs materially from that of the rest of the population: they have, in fact, a separate system of jurisdiction. Besides the chief, there are persons at the head of each division, or branch, who are called elders. These are in general either nearly or remotely related to the chief, and form the magistracy of the tribe in peace, and its officers in war. Their station is, like that of their chieftain, hereditary. It is from one of this body of elders that the latter, when he does not reside with the tribe, must select his deputy. The person he appoints to this office has as much power over the tribe as a governor of a city has over its inhabitants ; and although his rule, from the habits of those under him, is in some instances more lenient and patriarchal, it is in others more absolute, from possessing more of a military character; but, generally speaking, both the chiefs of tribes and those they depute to govern in their absence, are careful to preserve the temper and attachment of their followers. To this observation, however, there are frequent exceptions, and these petty rulers, when powerful, are often both cruel and oppressive.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. It is not easy to describe with accuracy the rude system of judi cature which prevails in this class of the inhabitants of Persia. Common cases are decided upon by the chief, or his deputy, in a manner similar to the lay magistrate of a city. When, however, a person of any consequence is concerned, the proceeding is not so summary; a council or meeting of elders is called, and the question is fully discussed, and decided by a majority of voices. Any man of family has the privilege to claim this trial, and it would be deemed oppressive to refuse it. In a dispute between inferior persons it cannot be demanded as a matter of right, but is often assembled by a chief or his deputy, who desires popularity, as the tribe almost invariably accord in the justice of a sentence passed by this tribunal. The council above mentioned is not formed of any determinate number. If it be to decide on any dispute relative to land, the prin cipal landholders form the council *. If on a case of debt, the chief elders, and the friends both of the debtor and creditor, meet to adjust it. When a murder is committed, the relations of the deceased and those of the murderer are summoned before it; and if both belong to the tribe, they are admitted to the assembly. The moollah of the tribe usually forms one of the council, and expounds, when required, the holy law. This council has generally for its object the accommodation of the dispute between the parties which come before it, and it appears to have been constituted to preserve harmony in the tribe -f*; but when it cannot accommodate the * Persian MS. f About eight years ago, a high noble, of the tribe of Kujur, was suspected of treason. The reigning monarch assembled a jaunkhoo, or ' council of elders,'46o THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. charxxiii difference, its authority is given to support the law. Among the wandering tribes, a^ among citizens, if a debtor refuse payment after a cauzee has signed a decree that the demands against him are just, he is either allowed a moderate period to make his payments good, or all his property is seized, and divided in equal shares among his creditors*. A murderer, when the crime is proved, is given up to the heir of the deceased-f* to do what he chooses with him | either to forgive, to take the price of blood J, or to put the criminal to death. It is almost always the object of the council of elders to compound for murder; and they are more anxious to do this when the parties are of different tribes; for if of the tribe, before whom he laid all the proofs of his guilt. They sentenced him to be severely punished and disgraced. This was a remarkable instance of an absolute sovereign preferring the exercise of his patriarchal power as chief of a tribe, to that of his prerogative as King of Persia. * The same law regarding bankrupts prevails among the inhabitants of all Maho- medan countries. In Persia, as has been before stated, the power of the magistrate corrects the defects of the religious code, in cases where Jews, Christians, or Hindoos, are creditors. f If the heir be not twelve years of age, the murderer is confined till he reaches that age. It was upon the pretext of attending to this law, that Abbas the Great evaded the punishment of the person whom he had employed to murder his eldest son, the Prince Suffee Meerza. — Vide Vol. I. p. 562. J The price of blood, as stated in the Koran, is one hundred camels, and freeing a Moslem from captivity : but this verse, like every other in that volume, has been variously interpreted ; and, as far as we can judge from the practice in Persia, this fine is not regulated by any precise rules, but depends chiefly on the power the one party has of paying, and the other of exacting. It is also affected by the rank of the party; and the most enormous sums have been sometimes given to induce a tribe to forgive the blood of one of their chiefs.fefiise THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 461 pride, or any other motive, prevent this settlement, and the offender chap.xxiii is screened from justice, the heir of the person murdered, and his relations, feel disgraced till they can obtain revenge. In these cases, where the party has not force to compel justice, assassina tion is applauded, though it almost always occasions more mur ders, and interminable blood feuds*. It is very usual for the heir * These feuds are most prevalent when the country is most distracted. An ambi tious chief employs those who desire to revenge personal or family wrongs to promote his cause. Many instances might be mentioned to show the action of this spirit of revenge. I know none more remarkable than that which recently occurred between the families of the chief of the tribe of Shuftee and that of the governors of Resht, the capital of the small province of Ghilan. A MS. in my possession contains the follow ing statement of this feud, or rather family war. « In the time of Shah Sultan « Hussein, Kassim Khan Shuftee slew Aga Kumai, Governor of Resht, whose son, ' Aga Jutnal, slew Kurreem, the son of Kassim, who had murdered his father. Aga ' Raffeah, the brother of Kassim, slew Aga JumeLl, and revenged his nephew. ' Hedayet Khan, the son of Aga Jumil, slew Aga Raffeah, and five of his brothers « and nephews: a child, called Aga Aly, the son of Kassim, was the only person of « the family of Shuftee that was preserved.

The tribes of Persia have very different usages relative to for giveness of murder: some have a pride in being considered im placable, and invariably exact life for life; but this is certainly not common. If a person belonging to a tribe desire forgiveness for a murder that he has committed, it is usual for him to hang a sword round his neck with a black cord, and to go in that sup pliant manner to the heir, and declare, when he approaches him, that he comes to receive his doom. Though the laws of honour almost always restrain his enemy from putting him to death, it is very rare that even the mandates of his superiors can compel one of these fierce barbarians to save his life by what he deems an unmanly « pledges, they came back ; but they thought of nothing but revenge : day and night ' they watched the movements of Hussein Kooli: at last one of the brothers of Aga ' Aly succeeded in shooting him as he was riding along the road.

At the period this account was written, A. D. 1810, the feud between the families of Shuftee and Resht had continued about seventy years. * The person who receives a bride in this manner neither pays the customary sums to his father-in-law, nor settles a dowry on his wife. It is not unusual to demand two or three females from the family of the murderer, for the heir and nearest relations of the deceased.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 463 and abject submission. When a man of a wandering tribe, or chap.xxiii a poor citizen, who has committed murder, is condemned to pay the price of blood, but cannot raise the amount required, it is customary to oblige him to wear a large iron collar round his neck, and to beg from all he meets, till he collect enough to discharge the fine. The persons who carry this symbol of their guilt and repentance are the most importunate of mendicants. The crimes of rape or of adultery are, among the wandering tribes in Persia, of very rare occurrence, and are almost always punished with death, which is generally inflicted by the hands of the nearest relation of the females whose honour has been violated*. The promiscuous manner in which these tribes live, admit of no laxity upon this point, as such could not fail of producing general depravity. The consequence is, that the chastity of their females is guarded by usages that are never infringed with impunity: and in cases of adultery, both parties are often the victims of jealousy and revenge-f; and if the fact be proved, the murderer is always ap plauded for having vindicated his insulted honour. If the chief of a tribe commit any open act of treason or of hostility against the government, the king, if he can seize him, deprives him of sight, or puts him to death, without hesitation: but if he has merited capital punishment for any other crime J than treason, the case is referred to the Sherr&amp;h, or ' court of written law/' that his blood may not rest upon the monarch. * Persian MS. t When I asked a well-informed chief of one of these tribes what punishment was inflicted on a female who was proved an adulteress, he answered, that her father, her husband, or her son, cut her to pieces! $ Persian MS.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap .xxiii It is not unusual, when a man of inferior rank belonging to a tribe, but in the king's immediate employ, merits death, for the king to make him over to his chief, who usually repays the con fidence reposed in him by his immediate execution. All these circumstances, as connected with the administration of justice among the military tribes of Persia, are calculated to show that they are governed by customs essentially different from those of the inhabitants of towns and villages; and that they are, in some degree, shielded by their habits, their union, and strength, from that oppression, to which some of the other classes in Persia are subject. With respect to the interference of the king with the internal administration of the wandering tribes, it can only be said that it continually fluctuates. Those, over whom circumstances give him power, allow him to do what he pleases; while the same tribe, differently situated, would revolt if he offered the slightest infringe ment of their usages. By the constitution of these tribes, they should be governed through their chief, whom it is always the object of the court to render a subservient instrument of its will: but still the influence of the head of the tribe continues, under all circumstances*, with a force that can hardly be credited, except by those who have been in the habit of contemplating the bigoted tenacity with which * The author of a memoir on the chiefs of Khorassan, after giving an account of Jaaffer Khan, late ruler of Nishapore, and now in confinement at Teheran, states, ' the ' tribe of Byat, though treated with great kindness, still continue to desire the return ' of their cruel chief, Jaaffer Khan ; and they are not withheld, by the memory of his ' oppression and injustice, from saving all they can from their small means, and secretly ' transmitting it for his support.'THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. ^ men, bom in such communities, preserve the first and deepest impres- chap.xxiii sion made upon their mind, of the virtue, as well as necessity, of an inviolable attachment to their hereditary lord. The Bukhteedree*, and several other tribes, can hardly be said to have ever entirely submitted to the Kings of Persia. Guarded by their inaccessible mountains, these rude races continue to be ruled by their own customs, and admit of hardly any interference on the part of the officers of government in their internal jurisdic tion. They consent to furnish a body of their youth as soldiers, and to pay a small tribute, that they may obtain a share of the produce of some of the fine vallies that lie at the foot of the hills which they inhabit; and every effort is made to encourage them to occupy those plains, not merely with the view of rendering them more tangible to the laws of the country, but to prevent (by giving them an interest in the general peace and order of society,) those frequent predatory attacks which they are in the habit of making upon, the more peaceable and civilized part of the population of the kingdom. The Arabian tribes, who are settled along the shores and on the islands of the Persian Gulf, continue to follow many of the usages of their ancestors. The interference of the king, or his officers, in the internal rule of these tribes, depends upon the state of subjection in which they are to his government; and that varies with those events which tend to weaken or strengthen his authority over the part of his kingdom which they inhabit. All the tribes who dwell upon the * The Bukhtee^ree and Fylee tribes inhabit the ranges of mountains which stretch from Isfahan to Shuster, and from the latter city to near Kermanshah. vol. ii. 3 o•466 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap .xxin continent of Persia, when the country is at peace, may be deemed subject to the authority of the officers of the government: but these seldom exercise any control over the inhabitants of the islands *, even when the latter profess an allegiance to the Monarch of Persia. It is the custom in Persia for the principal officers of the empire, and the chiefs of tribes, who are employed or dwell at a distance, to have a part of their family at the capital. These hostages (for such they are deemed,) are always watched, but seldom strictly guarded, unless where the person, for whose fidelity they are a pledge, is sus pected of treason. When he actually rebels, they are sometimes put to death: but examples of this severity are not frequent. The dread of their occurrence, however, while it retains numbers in the path of duty, makes every ruler, who is at all independent, refuse, as long as he is able to do so, to comply with this custom ; and his consenting to send his eldest son, or any part of his family, to remain at court, is always considered as a token of complete submission. The condition of the principal feudatories of Persia has been noticed. These, though they acknowledge the paramount power of the monarch, have always denied his right of interference in the in ternal government of their country. TheWaly or Prince of Georgia, whose territories have recently become a province of Russia, held, for many years, the first rank among those great tributaries. The Waly * At present, almost all the islands in the Gulf of Persia may be deemed independ ent of the king of that country.

He, however, claims a right of sovereignty over them all.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. ^ of Ardelan, in Kurdistan, still enjoys the dignity and privileges that chap.xxiii belonged to his ancestors. This chief exercises all the functions of a sovereign within the limits of his hereditary possessions. His system of government is, in its general features, the same as that established in other parts of Persia, only that his personal authority is limited by the situation in which he is placed; for he is checked in the exercise of his power by the fear of the superior lord, as well as the necessity of preserving that attachment to his person which constitutes his strength. Though there are several cities in Kurdistan, the military tribes of that country seldom inhabit either towns or considerable villages ; nor do they assemble, except for purposes of war, in large encamp ments. The dwelling of the native of this province is often soli tary; and whether the Kurds reside in houses or tents, it is sel dom that more than a few families dwell together. This custom, whether it arises from the nature of the country or from ad herence to ancient usage, is calculated to retard every progress to improvement. We have, indeed, evidence of the inhabitants of this country continuing in an unchanged state for more than twenty centuries -f*. Neither the rays of civilisation which enlight ened Persia under Nousheerwan, nor those that shone upon the neighbouring provinces of Arabia and Turkey under the most celebrated of the caliphs, ever penetrated amid the wilds of Kur distan, though these were situated in the immediate vicinity of Ctesiphon and of Bagdad. The Kurd saw and despised a know- * The Lesghees are remarkable for having their habitations similar to the Kurds, t Vide Vol. II, page 207.468 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap. xxiii ledge, which was accompanied by an eflfeminacy and luxury that rendered man more subject to the oppression and cruelty of his rulers. He preferred the savage freedom which he enjoyed amid his rugged mountains, and felt a pride in the privations and hardships to which he was exposed, when he regarded them as associated with his independence. It is not surprising that religion should never have made any great progress amid such a people. There is no proof of their ever having been zealous followers of the worship of Zoroaster; and though they now profess the faith of Mahomed, they are, in general, not only inattentive to the substance, but careless in the observance of the ceremonies it prescribes. In Sennah, which is the capital of Ardelan, and in some of the other towns, there are mosques and priests; and in these, the Sherr^h, or ' written law, is observed in nearly the same manner as in other parts of Persia. The principal distinction arises from most of the inhabitants of Kurdistan being Soonees; and their laws are, consequently, founded on the interpretation of the authorities which are respected by that sect. Among the ruder tribes of this province, the Sherr^h, or ' written ' law/' meets with little attention. They continue to be governed by the usages of their forefathers, and yield an obedience to their chief, which he repays by his protection, and by exercising his authority, on all occasions, with the utmost regard to their customs and prejudices*. * A remarkable instance of this occurred when I visited Persia in 1810. I was en camped at a village called Zagh£i, situated within twenty-five miles of Sennah, the capital of Ardelan. The officer who attended as Mehm&amp;.ndar, or ' entertainer,' to the mission on the part of the Waly, informed me, that a man of the tribe of Soorsoor (some families of which were encamped within a mile,) had, the day before, murderedTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. There are several districts in Kurdistan whose inhabitants pro- chap. fess allegiance to the Monarch of Persia, but who are even more independent of all attempts at interference with their internal govern ment than the province of Ardelan, because their mountains are more inaccessible. Among these, one of the most remarkable is a branch of the tribe of t$kdry % who dwell in that lofty ridge of hills his father. « He will, of course, be put to death,' I observed. ' I do not think he ' will,' said the mehm&amp;nd&amp;r : ' he is himself heir, and there is no one to demand the ' blood.'—' Will'not the prince of the country take care that this parricide does ' not escape?'—' The Waly,' he coolly replied, 'cannot interfere, in a case like ' this, unless appealed to: and, after all,' said he, ' if the affair be agitated, the ' murder will be Compounded. Among Kurds, who are always at war,' he added, ' the life of an active young man is much too valuable, to be taken away on ' account of a dead old one!' * This petty state, if we can credit those accounts we receive of it, have continued, for centuries, to enjoy more freedom than almost any other Asiatic tribe or nation can boast. Their ruler is a direct descendant from Jtiz-u-deen Sheer, a chief of the tribe of H^k^ry, who was Governor of Van when the Ameer Timour attacked that province. They are represented as constant in their allegiance to this family, except when serious complaints are urged against the reigning representative. On such occasions, the Agas, or ' heads of the different branches of the tribes,' whose condition is also hereditary, assemble, and summon him to attend. His conduct is tried j and if a majority of voices decide that he is unfit to rule, a particular leader places a pair of slippers before him. The chief immediately rises; and, putting them on, walks out of the assembly. The next heir succeeds : but the discarded ruler is protected in the enjoyment of the personal property of his family. We are assured, that all the usages of this community display the same character; and that, in their internal administra tion, the lowest individual is treated with respect and consideration by his superiors. There is an account of this tribe in the History of Kurdistan. I received some curious anecdotes of their usages from an intelligent officer who accompanied me from Tabreez, and had long lived in the neighbourhood. He told me, that they were4?0 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap .xxiii which lies immediately west of the Lake of Oormia, and approaches the vicinity of the Town of SMm^s, in Aderbijan. Several of the chiefs of Khorassan, who profess allegiance to the Kings of Persia, are as independent of his authority, in the internal rule of their possessions, as the Waly of Ardelan: but their situation differs from his in this essential respect: he inherits a power which has been enjoyed by his ancestors for many cen turies; theirs is of recent usurpation; and its destruction, and the subjugation of their principalities to a similar condition with the other parts of Persia, would be considered as the natural and just consequence of the re-establishment of the royal authority : whereas, any attempt to reduce Kurdistan to that condition, would be deemed a departure from the policy of the wisest and most powerful of the Monarchs of Persia, who have always respected the rights of the chiefs and the inhabitants of that country : and we may here notice a remarkable fact in proof of this observation, that, though some of their rulers boast a descent from the family of Mahomed, neither Arabian nor Tartar tribes have ever permanently settled in that great province.

Before the time of N4dir Shah, a great proportion of land had been granted for the support of the ecclesiastical esta blishment, which had been equally enriched by the generosity of the Kings of the Suffavean dynasty, and by the piety of their subjects. Personal estates had also increased during the long period of tranquillity which Persia had enjoyed under this dynasty to a very great extent: but N^dir, as has been before statedf, seized that property which had been appropriated for the support of the ecclesiastical body; and amid the revolutions that have succeeded his usurpation, almost all the principal families of Persia have perished, and their estates fallen into the possession of the crown. A very small portion of that territory which once belonged to the hierarchy of the country has been restored. The priests are at present chiefly supported by pecuniary stipends ; and a deduction from the revenue is admitted in every province to pay the judges of # Chardio, in his account of the revenue of Persia, makes a distinction between what he terms royal domains and government lands : the former, he observes, are more particularly at the disposal of the king.

Crown lands are cultivated by the peasantry of the province on termsf very favourable to the cultivator. When the crop has been measured { by an officer appointed for the purpose, if the seed be supplied by government, it is returned, and ten per cent of the whole is next put aside for reapers and thrashers; after which the crop that remains is equally H divided between the cultivator and the king.

The Mooshdiheds, or chief pontiffs, usually live upon their own means, or have lands assigned them. If there are any JVukf, or ' charity lands,' in the province to which they belong, they are placed under their management. The Paish-Nam&amp;z, or chief officiating priests, at the mosques, have often a salary from four to twelve hundred piastres per annum : but many of the most respected of their class perform the duty gratuitously. The shaikh-ul-isl^m, cauzee, &amp;c. have all fixed salaries. In the City of Isfahan, the sums paid to persons of this description were estimated at ten thousand tomans per annum. The annual pay of the shaikh-ul-isl^m at Shiraz was two thousand tomians. f These terms are said to have been first settled by Nousheerwan the Just. They are certainly of great antiquity. X The crop is measured on the ground. The expression in the Persian MS. from which I write is, ' as it stands,' which evidently means before it is reaped. || In one account it is stated, that this mode varies, and that the cultivator, in some parts of the kingdom, pays two thirds to the king. § The estates of individuals are of different tenures : some free; others pay a small quit rent; and some of a tenure not unlike our copyhold : they are held by deeds for ninety-nine years, renewable on paying the fine of a year's rent.—Vide Chabdin, Vol..

When that is certain, chap.xxiii and obtained from a flowing stream, they pay twenty per cent of their produce, after deducting seed and the allowance before stated for reapers and thrashers. If watered from aqueducts*, they pay fifteen per cent; and if from wells, or reservoirs, only five. The duty on estates is generally farmed by the owners, which prevents trouble and vexatious interference of the subordinate officers of the revenue with the landholder. Every encouragement is held out to the cultivators to sow those government lands, the crops of which depend solely upon rain. If the cultivator find the seed, ten per cent*f* only is demanded for the king. This crop is sometimes abundant, but often fails alto gether. This description of land, if it belong to individuals, is seldom cultivated; when it is, the proprietor pays five per cent on the actual produce.

In the more vol. ii. 3 p474 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap.xxiii of the year is furnished by the cultiv-ator. The crop is divided into three parts, of which one only is the property of government. Pri vate estates pay ten per cent of the produce on winter crops. The above may be assumed as the general principles by which the collection of revenue from land, in most of the provinces of Persia, is adjusted. Local circumstances and usages may make the amount of the government share vary in some parts of the kingdom ; but the difference is immaterial. The compact between the owners and cultivators of land and the government is simple, and well understood by all parties. The former often pay a con siderable proportion of their rent in kind. This, however, is regu lated by convenience, usage, and the ability of the cultivators. Some villages, of which the inhabitants are poor, pay the government share almost entirely in kind: but when the farmer has wealth, he generally prefers making cash payments for the whole, as he avoids, by that means, the interference of the inferior officers of the revenue department. According, however, to the general and established rule, the cultivator should pay half in money and half in kind arid regions of Persia it is much earlier. At Sbuster, and in almost all the provinces of Khuzistan and Deishestan, the seed is put into the ground in the latter end of November or beginning of December. * 1 find it mentioned in a note upon a statement of the revenues of Persia, that for every tom&amp;n that is paid in money, one khurw^r, or ass load of grain, is aloo levied. The khurw^r of grain is one hundred Tabreez maunds, about seven hundred pounds weight; and the fixed price, when it is taken in money, as it generally is, ought to be one toman per khurw&amp;r; so that the amount in kind is equal to that in money. 0 late years, however, government have often exacted at the rate of one toman and a half, and even two tom&amp;ns, per khurw^r.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 475 The general mode of settling for large tracts of land does not of chap.xxiii course apply to rich and highly manured fields, or to gardens in the immediate vicinity of towns. This is the only kind of land that is enclosed. It is generally rented for money, and often at a very high rate. When Persia was in a tranquil state, we are assured that some of the ground in the vicinity of Isfahan produced more than thirty crowns a jurreeb, which measurement is not above three quarters of an acre*: but this must have been either garden ground, or fields set apart for the cultivation of melons-f*. The government is always ready to dispose of waste land, par ticularly if it be required to build upon, or to plant a garden. A heritable lease is given, subject to a small ground tax; and the fruit trees and vines that are raised become subject to a tax, which varies according to the age of the tree and the quality of the fruit. The fixed tax upon fruit is very moderate J, and the extraordinary assessment cannot fall heavy, else this delightful luxury could not be raised in the abundance and at the cheap rate which it always is in Persia. * Charditi has given some very curious information upon this subject. f Melons have always been cultivated in great abundance in the vicinity of that capital. J In a statement which I received at Shiraz, in A. D. 1800, from a very intelligent native of that city, I find the tax on vineyards and fruit trees as follows: Vineyards, faryah, or ' certain water,'..6 deenars per vine. If buk/is, or ' uncertain water,' . 5 ditto ditto. Apple, pear, peach, &amp;c 20 ditto per tree. Walnuts 100 ditto ditto. The deenar here stated is a nominal coin, in which accounts are kept. There are one thousand deenars to the piastre, or about five hundred to the English shilling.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap.xxiii Both the form and the policy of the Persian government have always disposed it to grant arable lands to the wandering tribes on the most favourable terms ; but these seldom cultivate more than is necessary for their own consumption. The vast tracts of fine pasture lands which are allotted for their winter and summer residence, are considered as part payment for their military service; but a tax is levied upon families, according to their wealth and the number of their cattle and flocks which is collected by their chief, or by those whom he deputes to exercise his authority. A part of the fixed revenue of Persia is derived from ground rents of houses, rents of caravansaries, baths, shops, water-mills, manufactures-f, and duties upon all kinds of foreign and home mer chandise. Some of the sources of this part of the revenue have greatly increased since the extinction of the Suffavean family, and of that of Kurreem Khan, both of which revolutions have been attended with immense confiscations. Whole streets in the prin cipal cities, which before belonged to individuals, have become the property of government, and are rented to its subjects. The * This duty is not always the same, but it is never high. In the statement of col lections which I received at Shiraz, and to which I have before alluded, I find it rated to the inhabitants of that city and district as follows : A milch cow pays annually 300 deenars. An ass 200 ditto. A brood-mare 1000 ditto. A camel 300 ditto. A Sheep 6 . 700 ditto. f This includes cloths of all kinds, glass, leather, hardware, earthenware, &amp;c. 6 This appears disproportionate.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 477 revenue collected from shops is very considerable. When these chap.xxiii belong to government a rent is fixed, which is deemed propor- tionate to the gain derived by those who hire them. When they belong to individuals, the government claims twenty per cent of their computed annual profits. There is no impost in Persia that can be called a capitation tax, according to the strict sense of that term; but the mode of collecting the ground rents, and share of shop profits, in cities and towns, and that of levying the duties from the wandering tribes, is regulated by a similar principle. These imposts * are made according to general rules, and laid on houses or families, who pay them, not agreeably to their actual con dition at the moment, but as they are rated. The principles, however, upon which the whole of the fixed revenue of Persia is settled are at once just and moderate; and the system is so perfectly understood, that it is attended with neither difficulty nor oppression: but, unfortunately for that country, its monarchs have never been satisfied with the produce of this revenue; and the justice and moderation of the established assessment have only served to make the inhabitants of Persia feel more sensibly those irregular and oppressive taxes to which they are continually exposed. The first of these extra taxes may be termed usual and extra ordinary presents. The usual presents to the king are those made annually by all governors of provinces and districts, chiefs of tribes, ministers, and all other officers in high charge, at the feast of * The revenue term, Ser Shum&amp;ree, or ' numbering of individual heads,' and Khin^ih Shumaree, or ' numbering of families,' which are used in Persia to describe the mode of collection, show that these duties approximate to a capitation tax.478 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap.xxiii Nouroze, or vernal equinox These gifts are regulated by the nature of the office and the wealth of the individual, and consist of the best of the produce of every part of the kingdom. Sometimes a large sum of money is given, and this is always the most acceptable present that can be made. There is a necessity for every officer of high rank making this annual offering, which is indeed deemed part of the revenue; and, as such, falls ultimately upon the farmers, cultivators, and manufacturers. The amount presented on this oc casion is generally regulated by usage : to fall short, is loss of office; and to exceed, is increase of favour. The tribute paid to the King of Persia by those princes and chiefs who own him as their para mount lord, is transmitted at this season, and may be classed under the same head as the other presents given at the Nouroze. We are assured that the receipts from this branch of revenue amount to nearly as much as two fifths of the fixed revenue of the kingdom : and we are more reconciled to a belief of this fact, from a knowledge that one governor of a province has for several years past never made an annual present of less than one hundred thousand tomdns f*. * There is every reason to conclude that this usage of receiving presents on the Nouroze has existed in Persia from the most early times. t Mr. Morier, who saw the offerings presented to the king on the feast of Nouroze, A. D. 1808, states, that the paishkush, or offering of Hajee Mahomed Hussein Khan, was ' fifty-five mules, each covered with a fine Cashmere shawl, ' and carrying a load of one thousand tonicins.' This respectable nobleman, who is minister of finance, and governor of Isfahan and all the districts subordinate to that city, derives his power to make these splendid offerings to his sovereign from the most legitimate of all sources — the general improvement of the country committed to his charge.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 479 Besides the usual tribute from dependant princes and chiefs, and chap.xxiii presents from officers in high station, which are made at the Nou- roze, there are extraordinary presents of a less defined nature, but which are also of very considerable amount. It is not customary to collect duties in camp; but the merchants admitted to attend it are expected to give collectively a large offering in money to the king. Every person appointed to high employ makes a present, as a token of his gratitude: and this amount, which is usually settled before his nomination, may often be deemed the purchase money of his station. Monopolies are not unknown in Persia; but this invidious mode of increasing the revenue is not common. The produce of fines imposed on crimes by the courts of Urf, or ' custo- ' mary law,' and of involuntary presents extorted from those who are suspended or dismissed from employment, which are levied on the pretext of delinquency, is very considerable: and we are not surprised when informed, that the amount annually collected from these, and other sources equally corrupt and oppressive, has been estimated at six hundred thousand tomdns; a sum equal to one fifth of the fixed revenue of the state: but it is impossible to make any exact calculation of an amount which depends so much upon the character of the monarch. The most oppressive of all the imposts of Persia is called S^dir; a term which means ' a public requisition ;' and, in its opposite sense to the Malliaat, or ' fixed revenue,' denotes that description of taxation which is raised to provide for extraordinaries. If an addi tion is made to the army; if the king desires to construct an aqueduct, or build a palace; if troops are marching through the country, and require to be furnished with provisions; if a foreign480 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap.xxiii mission arrives in Persia; if one of the royal family is married ; or, in short, on any occurrence not ordinary, an impost is laid, sometimes upon the whole kingdom, and at others only on particular provinces. This is regulated by the nature of the occurrence which requires the supply, and a consideration of its local or general application. The Sadir extends to all classes. It usually bears lightest upon the wandering tribes, not only because they are the poorest, but because they are the most impatient of this species of taxation. It falls heaviest upon the proprietors of estates, and citizens. It is, or rather ought to be, levied according to defined rules; and every per son should pay the SMir, or ' contribution/' in the proportion that he pays the Malliaat, or ' fixed revenue but the governors of pro vinces usually exercise an arbitrary discretion in the collection of this tax, which renders it more oppressive*. They settle the gross amount that each village is to pay; and this affords them an opportunity of showing partiality, and committing injustice. The sum derived from this source has been calculated at two fifths of the amount of the fixed revenue: and it has been concluded, on the grounds above stated, that the receipts of the King of Persia from presents, fines, and extraordinary taxes, are equal to the amount of the established taxes, which make the revenue of the kingdom amount to a sum little less than six millions sterling: but a proportion of this only is paid in money into the royal treasury. A large deduction is * This tax is often rendered very severe upon the poorer class of cultivators, by the necessity they are under of selling the crops upon the ground at a low price, in order to pay it.

It is also a general practice to pay the chief ministers of religion and of justice, the principal officers of state, the royal household, and the army, by assignments on the public revenue of different provinces. There are sufficient grounds to conclude that the general ac count which has been given of the revenue of Persia is tolerably correct. It rests upon the authority of well-informed natives. Perhaps the total amount stated to be collected is somewhat ex- aggerated. The disbursements of the government of Persia cannot easily be ascertained : but we know, as a positive fact, that they are much less than the receipts. It has in general been the policy of the monarchs of that kingdom, as of most Asiatic despots, to amass wealth; for in all countries where there is no public credit, a full treasury is deemed essential to the security of the state. It will be important, before we conclude this short account of the nature of the government of Persia, and of the mode of administering justice and collecting the revenues in that kingdom, to offer a few general observations upon the power of the monarch, and the prac tical effects of the whole system of the internal administration of the country. Nothing can be more difficult than to describe the operation of the separate parts, or the whole of a system of government, which is exposed, like that of Persia, to continual and violent changes : but, though these changes produce a great effect both on the character and condition of the nation, they neither destroy nor materially alter those rules which are established for the conduct of the administra tion, and which, guarded as they are by usage, by public opinion, vol. ii. 3 q482 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap.xxiii and by religion, are seldom infringed with impunity. The govern- ment of this country may be termed a military despotism, the action of which is regulated by a consideration of the condition of its subjects, and the situation of the empire. The power of the Monarch of Persia rests chiefly upon the fear he inspires. It has been well observed, that the arm of a despotic prince should be always uplifted. He must be prompt to repel foreign attack, and to repress every appearance of sedition, or rebellion ; for, surrounded by the ambitious and the turbulent, he can enjoy no security, and his subjects can know no peace, unless he be dreaded. Powerful nobles, and high officers of the empire, are, from its frame, arbitrary in their respective charges; and when these cease to tremble at the supreme authority, the nation suffers a great increase of misery under a mul titude of tyrants. The chief ministers of the Court of Persia enjoy a very consider able, though indirect power, from being the medium of representa tion to a sovereign who generally acts from the impulse of the moment, and whose decisions must consequently be much regulated by the sentiments of those in whom he reposes confidence. This kind of power, of doing good or evil by secret or open communica tion with the king, belongs, in a greater or less degree, to all the officers of his government, and the domestics of his household: and, as the nature of absolute power makes it impossible that persons so immediately attached to the monarch should be amenable to any in ferior tribunal, it follows that this class should be entirely subject to his will. It is impossible, from the shape of the government, that the condition of this class of persons should be otherwise than it is: and no small proportion of that security which the rest of the corn-THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 483 mumtj enjoy, may be referred to the danger in which those near chap.xxiii the king continually stand; for, unless he be very weak or very unjust, it is hazardous for any of his ministers, or courtiers, to commit violence or injustice in his name. The governors and chiefs of tribes may be considered in nearly the same relation to the king as his ministers: and when we reflect on the facility which the habits of the Persian monarch afford to his subjects of preferring complaints* and that policy which dictates attention to them, we must be satisfied that, in a rude and half-civil^ ized community, the exercise of the absolute power of the sovereign over those to whom he delegates his authority, is essential to preserve the people, at large, from the oppression and rapacity of petty rulers. Though a great proportion of the Kings of Persia may be deemed capricious, cruel, and unjust, we find very few examples in the history of that country of their exercising their absolute prerogative, except over those whom usage, and the condition of the state they govern, have placed at their disposal: but this class has of late become more numerous, from the frequent wars and rebellions with which the kingdom has been afflicted. Amid scenes of revolution, neither life nor property is safe, as the peaceable inhabitants of the country are * Every individual who resides at the capital, or has the means of going to it, may find an opportunity of personally communicating with the king. The usual time is at the morning salam, or ' levee.' A short time ago an English artillery serjeant, em ployed in disciplining the Persian troops, availed himself of this circumstance to prefer a complaint to the king against a paymaster, who had kept back his pay. He sue- ceeded in his application for redress; and the proceeding, on his part, was considered perfectly regular.484 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap.xxiii dragged into a participation of the crimes of the different individuals w ho are aspiring to the crown ; and that very weakness which com^ pelled them to acknowledge one party, too often invites the other to plunder them : but it is never considered that a monarch can be jus tified, unless under the circumstances which have been mentioned, in seizing the property, or taking the life of any of his subjects, not in his immediate employ. The King of Persia always exercises his power as the chief magis trate of the Urf, or ' customary law/' in his own capital, and the district surrounding it; and all civil and criminal cases, after being examined by subordinate officers of justice, are submitted to him for decision. His numerous occupations compel him, in the perform ance of this part of his duty, to trust, in a great degree, to others, or to form a very hasty judgment on the cases brought before him: and this summary proceeding, added to the mode of execution, which is generally in his presence, and is always inflicted by executioners* who attend his person, often give a character of barbarous tyranny to acts of the most exemplary justice. We generally find, that in a country like Persia the inhabitants of the capital, who are under the imme diate jurisdiction of the monarch, are the happiest, and the best governed. Their temper is of more consequence to the despot than that of any other part of his subjects; and they are, therefore, treated with more lenity and consideration. They are seldom exposed to be tyrannised over by any other than the sovereign : and assuredly of all # The Ferashha-e-Ghuzzub, or ' executioners,' (literally ' servants of anger or ' violence,') always attend the king, and are ready, at every moment, to execute his commands. «■THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 485 the evils which belong to absolute power, the greatest is the necessary chap.xxiii delegation of its vast authority to mean and sordid agents, whose minds must, from their condition, be insensible to many of the higher motives that may be expected to influence the conduct of the chief ruler. Many European travellers, who have resided at the capital of Persia, have felt a very natural horror at the tyranny of particular sovereigns; and have given, in consequence, an exaggerated pic ture of the condition of that country. One writer affirms, that ' the Persians expect injustice from their kings *but the idiom atic phrases which he adduces to support this assertion, only prove that they recognise an unlimited power in their sovereign, which they will admit in no other person. The same author, whose experience was very great, and whose local knowledge was very minute, after a detail of the caprice and cruelty of the Kings of Persia, upon which the philosophers of his country have grounded many just, and some erroneous opinions, concludes with the fol lowing remarkable observation. ' After all, I never saw, and never heard of the king committing any outrageous act of vio- lence, unauthorized by a public procedure, against any person ' not in the class of courtiers, or public officers of government. * Ctardm (Vol. V. page 21%) informs us, that a person often exclaims, when speaking of another who is oppressive, Pddshdee mekunnud, which signifies, ' He acts ' the kingand if they experience violence from any one, they exclaim, Mugur pad- sh&amp;ee ton, « Perhaps thou art a king and again, when complaining of the tyranny of another individual, they say, Pddshdee ba mun-lcurdd-ust, that is, « He acted the king ' Wlth me •' , A11 th ese expressions merely mean, that the person of whom they were made, assumed a power which did not belong to him.486 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. ciiap.xxiii ' With respect to the latter,' he very truly states, ' that the danger « they incur does not diminish their solicitude for employment. ' They listen attentivelyhe adds, ' to the accounts they hear of 44 those countries where life and property are secure; but the impres- ' sion made upon their minds is of the same character as that which ' most men receive when told of the joys of the other world. It is ' unaccompanied by any desire to leave that which they inhabit*/' This writer also observes, and with truth, that in a government like Persia it would be impossible to adopt any other than the most prompt and vigorous measures when a great offender is concerned. It is, indeed, obvious, that a noble of rank, (particularly the chief of a tribe,) would almost always have the means of escaping punish ment; and the monarch is forced, therefore, to proceed with caution, lest, in the attempt to destroy a guilty individual, he should hazard his own safety, or the peace of the country. It is, from these causes, that marks of favour and honorary dresses not unusually precede dis grace and death. The victim is decorated for the sacrifice; and the dagger of assassination is employed to perform the office of the sword of justice. The actual power of the Monarch of Persia depends upon the condition of his empire; and as that is continually fluctuating, it is impossible to do more than to offer some general observations on the limits fixed to it by usage, and to state what the king himself recog nises as the bounds of his own authority, and what is generally believed he cannot overstep without danger of serious discontent and tumult, if not of general rebellion. # Chardin, Vol. V. page 231, 232.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. ^ The king claims, as has been before stated, the right of judging ciiap.xxiii upon all occasions the conduct of his ministers, officers, and servants, and of fining, disgracing, plundering, or putting them to death, at pleasure: but even this admitted power, which is always considerably checked by public opinion, does not extend to any interference with their religion; nor is he considered to have a right to seize, or to confiscate, any personal property belonging to them which their family possessed before they entered his service, and which is guarded by legal titles, and has either been granted or purchased by them or their ancestors. This species of property is deemed under the peculiar protection of the Sherrah, or ' written law;' and a violent seizure of it would be considered as a most tyrannical out rage. It, however, continually occurs, that when the king imposes a heavy fine upon a minister or governor of a province, whom he deems a public delinquent, he adopts rigorous measures to enforce payment, till he compels him to sell his estates, and government is usually the purchaser: but the very observance of this form, in cases where the individual is one of that class whose persons and property are admitted to be at the mercy of the monarch, is the strongest of all proofs of that respect in which this kind of property is held. It is owing to the violent revolutions to which Persia has been lately exposed, that so many estates have been forfeited by the flight or extinction of the families by whom they were possessed: but there are still numbers of this class who can boast the enjoyment of lands * that have for centuries belonged to their ancestors. * I was told by Meerza Buzoorg, the prime minister of the Prince Abbas Meerza, that h^s personal estate had been in his family several centuries; and many of the4&amp;8 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap.xxiii The conduct of the Monarchs of Persia to the ecclesiastical order has, with very few exceptions, been always the same. This class is, in a great degree, exempt from that tyranny which oppresses others: and the land which has been granted by government, or by individuals, for the support of mosques, colleges, and tombs, is deemed sacred, and can neither be alienated nor seized. It is true that Nddir Shah secularized almost the whole of this property; but this measure was deemed not only indefensible, but sacrilegious: and we have not in Persian history another example of so violent an act of authority. If the sovereign be restrained, by a sense of the religion he professes, and a deference for the general feeling of those whom he governs, from oppressing the religious order, he is no less prevented by usage, and the apprehension of exciting secret discon tent or open revolt, from interfering with the established customs of the military tribes of his dominions : and even the civil branches of the population of Persia may, unless in cases of insurrection, be pronounced as exempt from suffering, in a direct manner, from the tyrannical exercise of the personal authority of the monarch of that country. Their lives and property are generally secure, unless under the sentence of the law : and though their judges and magistrates can impose fines, inflict corporal punishment, and sentence to death, they have no power of directing landed property of inheritance to be seized or alienated, unless for the satisfaction of creditors: and we cannot have a better proof of the security of private estates, than a ancestors of this minister enjoyed high station. I have known several persons of less note, who assured me, that they inherited lands which had been for an equally long time possessed by their forefathers.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA 489 knowledge that, during the latter years of the Suffavean dynasty, chap.xxiii land sold for twenty-five and thirty years' purchase; and that all the late revolutions which have afflicted Persia, and the heavy im posts that have been laid upon the inhabitants of that country, have never reduced it below one half of its former value*. The king nominates whomsoever he pleases to be governors of provinces and principal collectors of the revenue: but a military tribe will only obey a leader who belongs to the family of their chiefs; and the king is not always able to interrupt the regular succession. When he appoints, or, more properly speaking, supports a chief who is disagreeable to the tribe, their violent discontent and insub^ ordination often compel him to revoke the measure he has adopted. The principal magistrates of cities, who act under the governor, and those appointed to preside over different wards, must, as has been before stated, not only be natives of the city, but persons who are agreeable to the majority of the inhabitants. These officers, therefore, and the magistrates of towns and of villages, may almost be said to be elective. The effect of this system is to render the situation of the magistrate of a town like that of the chief of a tribe; and we often find that it is hereditary in a particular family. A magistrate so chosen may occasionally bend before a storm he cannot resist, and become an instrument of tyranny and oppres sion ; but all his natural feelings, and the interest of himself and his successors, must dispose him to use what power he has for the protection of his fellow-citizens : and the custom, therefore, which * About ten years ago, land in the vicinity of Shiraz was sold at twelve years' purchase, which was deemed a very low price. vol. ii. 3 r490 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap.xxiii grants to the inlmbitants of Persia this right of influencing the nomi- nation of their immediate superiors, is very effective in preserving them from some of the worst evils of a despotic rule. This privilege, as has been mentioned, is extended to all the principal tradesmen and artisans of Persia. In every great city each class has its head, whom, the general voice has raised to that condition; and through this person all particular imposts laid upon the trade, or manufacture, to which the party belongs, are paid, while all grievances are represented through the same channel. There is no country in which men enjoy more personal freedom in regard to their place of residence than in Persia. All ranks, except those in the public service, or slaves, (who are not numerous,) may go where they choose within the kingdom, or leave it whenever they desire to do so. There is no passport required : the govern ment never offer any obstruction to an individual following his own inclination in this particular; and the facility ^ with which men can remove from the effects of tyranny, may be deemed one of their securities against its oppression. We have already stated, that the confusion which prevails in Persia, between the courts of Sherrdh and Urf, or ' written and ' customary law/' has been purposely promoted, not only by the monarch, but by all those who enjoy power. It is a great source of illicit emolument: for in cases of dispute, (except on points expressly limited to the decision of the written law,) the favour * There are some exceptions to this rule.

It is quite impossible to define the exact nature of a system which varies with the character of the chief ruler, and of those whom he employs, and which is more or less Oppressive, as he is moderate and just, or venal and rapacious. In a country where the law, as it is termed, is administered in so summary a manner, and where decisions are given at the moment, and upon a hurried examination of facts, men with the best intentions may often pronounce an unjust sentence: and those who desire to screen guilt, or to punish innocence, have the easy means of doing so under the form of justice. The principal check upon the conduct of subordinate governors is an appeal to the throne, which those whom they oppress can always make, as no person can prevent an individual in Persia from seeking that relief; and when he reaches court, he is certain of attention; for sup posing even that there is no disposition to redress the injured, it is by an accumulation of these complaints against the governors of provinces and cities, that the king and his ministers furnish them selves with matter of accusation, which either affords a pretext of removing and plundering the party accused, or of compelling him to share with them the spoils he has obtained by the abuse of his power. It is impossible for the most virtuous public officer to guard against these accusations, which are often brought forward by the intriguing efforts of his enemies: and when the court is corrupt, innocence is no security. Men in high station, therefore, may be said to be com pelled to violence and extortion by the character of the system. They must provide themselves with the only means by which they492 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap.xxiii can satisfy the cupidity of their superiors, and save themselves from disgrace and punishment. The same species of corruption which prevails in the judicial administration, pervades that of the collection of the revenue: but oppression in this branch is attended with more difficulty; as it is not unusual for whole villages and districts to rise against it; and when the distance prevents their going in a body to the capital, they send deputies. This proceeding is seldom adopted with a hope of obtaining redress, but it is almost certain to stop the progress of abuse; for no person, unless very powerfully supported, dare con tinue to oppress those who have carried their complaints before the king. The situation of the public officers in Persia, from the highest to the lowest rank, appears precarious, and full of anxiety and danger; yet there is no country in which employment is more eagerly sought. It always gives consequence, and sometimes wealth; and all who attain it seem desirous of grasping as much as they can without a very flagrant violation of law and justice. The higher ranks are in some degree restrained by a regard for that popularity which gives them strength; and the lower, by a fear of the punishment which follows detection and exposure. The situation of the petty magistrates and collectors of districts*, between rapacious and vio lent superiors, who desire to exact more than the revenue, and a rude and turbulent populace, who are reluctant to pay even just * Every province in Persia is divided into ballooks, or districts, to each of which there is a separate zaubit, or manager, whose duty usually combines that of magistrate and collector.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 493 dues, must, however, be very miserable. A few years ago, when charxxiii the prince, who is governor general of Fars, called upon the officers of his court to know what punishment he should inflict upon a very notorious thief, who had just been seized; ' Make ' him/' said a noble, whom age and the loss of his sight had privileged to speak his sentiments with freedom, ' the manager ' of a district in Fars. I can conceive no crime/' he added, ' for ' which such an appointment would not be an adequate punish- ' ment.' The despotic and venal system of government which has long prevailed in Persia has not subdued the spirit of the natives of that kingdom; nor has it impoverished them in that degree which might have been expected. The ministers and chief nobles appear to be in the enjoyment of affluence; and all persons in the public ser vice seem to have ample means of supporting themselves and their families. Some of the merchants and principal inhabitants of towns are possessed of considerable property ; and among the other classes of the people, though few are rich, there seem to be hardly any in actual want*. The latter may, in a considerable degree, owe this exemption from penury to their fine climate and productive soil, and to their industry and frugal habits: but in Persia, as in other countries, falsehood and deceit keep pace with tyranny and injustice: and the abuses of the government, and the constant changes to which it is exposed, appear to have more effect upon the moral than on the physical condition of the people. In Persia * I should pronounce, as far as my own observation went, that there are feWer mendicants in Persia than in any country I ever saw.494 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap.xxiii every man complains of his poverty, and of the violence of the government; but this complaint as often proceeds from a desire to avoid oppression, as from its actual pressure. The system is bad, and those who suffer from it, naturally hate the persons by whom it is administered; and to this feeling, which is destructive of all social ties between the rulers and those whom they govern, we may, in a great degree, attribute the constant recurrence of those internal troubles in Persia, which have for so long a period exposed that country to a succession of civil wars and revolutions. The character of the persons intrusted with the government of provinces, must always have a considerable influence on the happiness and prosperity of the people. The Satraps of ancient Persia appear to have had the same power as the Beglerbegs of modern times. The Caliphs, while they held that kingdom, divided it among military leaders; and the conquerors from Tartary, who established their sovereignty over it, pursued the same system, but employed the princes of their own families in these high stations. Some of the Suffavean kings adopted this policy : but the last monarchs of that race confined their sons to the haram, as is the modern usage of Turkey; and, with the hope of increasing their revenue, and of preventing rebellion, they nominated men of low birth and civil pursuits to the office of superintendants or farmers of provinces: the consequence has been shown; tranquillity was obtained, but the empire weakened. Ntldir Shah, and his immediate successors, employed military chiefs in all the principal governments; and the reigning monarch has divided almost the whole of Persia among his sons: but he places with these princes viziers or ministers, whom he considers in a great degree responsible for the internal'Hij THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 495 government of the province. In some cases, a separate person chap.xxiii is appointed superintendant of the revenue, and there is almost always an officer nominated by the crown to command the troops*^ It appears very difficult to pronounce on the merits of these opposite systems: that now pursued is certainly the most generous; but, though the conduct of royal governors, who desire to attach those under their rule, and who are above being the mere purveyors of an avaricious court, may give present prosperity to the kingdom, the extent of future danger cannot be concealed. On the occurrence of an accident to their common parent, whom they obey from habit and from duty, their condition becomes critical, if not desperate; and submission, even to an elder brother, is no security against their continuing an object of his suspicion. In such circumstances, rebellion, or flight from the kingdom, present the only roads to safety; and the latter is not likely to be contem plated till all hopes are abandoned of the former being successful. We shall conclude this Chapter, upon the Government of Persia, Army. by a short view of the army of that state, which comprises a con siderable body of irregular horse, furnished by the military tribes of the country, and commanded by their own chiefs; a numerous irre gular militia, raised and supported by the provinces and principal of Persia. * When I first visited Shiraz, in 1800, the Prince Hussun Aly Meerza was governor general of Pars ; Cher^gh Aly Khan was his vizier; Meerza Mahomed Khan, the son of Hajee Ibrahim, was the superintendant of revenue; and N&amp;sser-ullah Khan Kara- goozaloo was commander of the forces. When I was there in 1810 the prince con tinued governor general; but Mahomed Nubbee Khan held both the oflace of vizier and superintendant of revenue. Saduck Khan, a military chief, of the Kujur tribe, commanded the troops.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap.xxiii cities of the empire ; and a corps of infantry and artillery, clothed a nd disciplined in the European manner. The irregular horse of modern Persia are the same kind of troops which opposed the Romans; and they have preserved not only the habits, but the mode of fighting, of their forefathers *. As the men are robust and brave, and their horses active and strong, there cannot be a cavalry more suited for all the purposes of preda tory warfare. The Persians assert, that their monarch can command a body of eighty thousand of this description of troops, who perform military service in return for grants of land, and liberty of pasture. Evfery chief of a tribe is obliged to furnish a quota-f*, proportionate to the numbers of his followers.

I find it stated in one MS. that the possessor of every water-mill in Persia was obliged to contribute a man, mounted and equipped for public service. I am not certain that this usage still exists; but it is not more than six years ago since it was stated, by a Persian nobleman in high public employ, to be one of the resources of the country : it is probable, therefore, that the obligation is recognized, and that when the horseman is not required, the owner of the mill pays a sum of money to government. It is a remarkable fact, that a usage similar to the above mentioned, prevails over many parts of Turkey. J The horsemen are furnished by the families of a tribe, according to established custom. Sometimes one family furnishes several horsemen, at others only one ; and two or three small families are often charged with the support of only one mounted soldier. It is common to find substitutes, where there is no youth in the family fit for the service. 11 This seldom exceeds five or six tomans per annum, and is paid by an assignmentTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. This class of the army, unless there be a prospect of plunder, or their own chief is in command, give their services verjv reluctantly. They are only obliged to attend a few months in the year; and, if not engaged in active hostilities, always return home during the winter. The Monarch of Persia has constantly, near his person a body of horse, which are termed, as a distinction, his slaves, or royal guards. This favourite corps, which at present does not exceed three or four thousand men, is formed promiscuously from Georgian slaves, and the sons of the first nobles of Persia. They are well mounted, and well armed, at the public expense; and their pay* is not only better than that of the other troops, but they are employed on every service that is likely to add to their income^. Almost all the population of Persia are armed ; and there is a militia in every part of the country, which is equally formed from on the revenue, which the persons who receive it sometimes discount at a considerable loss. Each horseman has also an annual allowance of two ass loads of grain. The officers of this body have a larger pay than the men ; but few receive more than fifteen or twenty tomans per annum, and four or five ass loads of grain. The ass load, it has been before mentioned, is computed at 700lbs.; and the regulated value, if government pay it in money, is one tom&amp;n. * They receive from twenty to thirty tomans per annum: and as this is usually given in an assignment upon the revenue, and they are allowed to go personally to receive it, they almost always exact more than their due. This is not difficult; for the very name of Gholam Shah, or ' one of the king's personal guards,' throws a village, or district, into alarm. f Each of the princes of the blood that is employed in a separate government has a small body of Gholams, or ' personal guards,' who are upon the same footing, in regard to their pay, equipments, and employment, as those of the king. VOL. II. 3 s498 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap.xxiii men of wandering tribes, and the inhabitants of cities and villages. The usual duties of this militia are to defend their homes, and to aid the police. They are maintained by the province, town, or village, to which they belong; and are liable to be called out on any emergency: but when employed with the army, or in distant gar risons, they receive pay from government*. The number of this registered militia is stated to exceed one hundred and fifty thousand men. They provide their own clothing and arms. The former is the common dress of the country to which they belong: the latter usually consist of a matchlock, sabre, and dagger. The militia has no further discipline than that of obeying their own officers: and neither the men of this class, nor the irregular horse, will submit to be commanded by any but those of their own body, whom they deem their superiors. Before the reign of Shah Abbas the Great, the only army of Persia was the irregular horse, and the common infantry, or militia of the country. That monarch, with the desire of opposing the Turkish janizaries, and from a wish to check the overgrown power of the khans, or chiefs of tribes, formed a corps of twelve thousand infantry, and a rude park of artillery. He also raised a body of twelve thousand horse, which were commanded by the favourite officers of court. Through the aid of this force of infantry and cavalry, who were in discriminately formed from men of military tribes and Georgian slaves, and who were entirely dependent upon the monarch, Abbas, and his immediate successors, were able to keep in check, and ulti- * Their pay, when employed, is from five to seven tomans per annum, and from two to three ass loads of grain.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. mately to destroy the power of the great khans, or chiefs of military tribes, whose followers had before constituted the whole force of the kingdom, and who were first reduced to thirty thousand men, and ultimately so broken and discouraged, that they ceased to be formid able either to the monarch of the country, or his enemies. The spirit and strength of this branch of the army of Persia has been revived by those scenes of turbulence and war with which that country has been afflicted during the last century; and the army of Aga Mahomed Khan consisted of irregular horse and infantry, a few unwieldy pieces of cannon, and a number of zumbooruks*, or camel swivels: but the present monarch has, with a view of op posing the Russians, and of strengthening his internal government, formed a body of regular infantry and artillery f, which already # This name is derived from zumboor, or « wasp.' The terminating k marks the diminutive, and these swivels may be called little wasps. f The disciplined infantry of Persia consists of two great divisions, called the Surb^z, or ' the resolute,' and J^nb^z, or « the contemners of life.' The former, which consists of twelve corps of one thousand men each, has been raised and is maintained by the Prince Abbas Meerza, the heir apparent. This division is composed of men of particular tribes and districts. There are two regiments of the tribe of Affshar, two of that of Shak&amp;kee, two of Marandee, one of the inhabitants of Erivfoi, one of those of Tabreez and its vicinity, one of Karadlighee, one of Kangooloo, one of Mookuddum, and one of Dumballoo. All the men of whom this division is formed are natives of the province of Aderbijan, which is under the immediate government of their royal commander. The Prince Abbas Meerza has also raised a regular brigade of cavalry, consisting of twelve hundred men, and a corps of horse artillery of sufficient strength to man twenty field pieces. Both these corps are formed of men from the different military tribes. The whole of this body of troops was first disciplined by French officers, and afterwards by English. It has, however, chiefly owed the efficiency it has attained to the character of Abbas Meerza, who has laboured to500 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. ciiap .xxiii amount to twenty thousand men: and part of this new body of troops, who have been latterly trained by English officers, are clothed, armed, and paid by government, and established on a foot ing quite distinct from the militia of the country. There is no subject of such essential importance to any country as the constitution of that army which is to preserve its national independence. It appears evident that the military force of a kingdom must be of a character congenial with that of the govern ment, or it cannot be efficient for its defence. A barbarous despotism is always in danger of perishing by the means by which it was assimilate it, both in appearance and equipments, to the regular armies of Europe. The pay of the troops of which it is composed is superior to that of any other class of troops in Persia. The pay of the officers is from forty to five hundred tomans per annum; and the common soldiers receive ten tom&amp;ns, besides certain articles of dress, and rations when on service. The different regiments of which this force is composed are willing to be commanded by European officers, but are reluctant to grant the same obedience to Persian superiors of a different tribe. It has, however, been the policy of Abbas Meerza to subdue this spirit; and he has placed some of his favourite officers in charge of corps formed of tribes to which they do not belong. As an addi tional encouragement to this new branch of the Persian army, crown lands have been granted to the soldiers who serve in it, on more favourable terms than they are given to any other tenants. The Jlinb&amp;.z, who are more immediately attached to the king, are nominally of an equal number with the Surbaz, but their real strength is not computed at more than eight or nine thousand men. This body of troops is neither so well paid, clothed, nor disciplined, as that under the prince. They are formed, in the same manner, of distinct tribes. Among these are two regiments of Bukhteeiirees : and it is a remarkable fact, that these rude mountaineers have been reported, by the English officer who was em ployed to discipline them, as more tractable and intelligent than any other corps in the service.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 501 created, and is supported: and the very violence which it must use ciiap.xxiii to preserve its existence, has the effect of keeping its subjects in a rude state; for they will neither labour to produce that which force may wrest from them, nor abandon any of those defences which their personal habits, their social union, or their local situation, afford them, as a shield against the violence of tyrannical power. In civilized communities, military tribes cannot be allowed to exist, as they are constituted upon principles at variance with such an order of society. In such, therefore, the army of the state is indiscriminately formed from all ranks of its subjects; and the force of example, and the severity of discipline, supply the want of those habits and sentiments which give energy and force to the warlike inhabitants of a ruder government: but it is one consequence of this condition, that a nation almost entirely intrusts its safety to its army. If that be con quered, it falls; for the remainder of the people cannot become soldiers in a day; and they are, from their occupations and peace able habits, incapable of that irregular, but effective resistance, which a population of a different character continue to offer to invaders, long after their armies have been defeated, and their cities taken. It continually occurs, that the despotic monarchs of uncivilized countries desire to have all the advantages of those permanent esta blishments, which give prosperity and strength to a well-regulated government, and hope to attain these, particularly a disciplined army, without any sacrifice of their absolute power. These efforts to obtain objects which are incompatible, may succeed so far, as to add, for the moment, to the internal tranquillity of the country, by checking or subduing the turbulent spirit and ambition of feudatory lords, andTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 502 chap.xxiii their warlike followers: but a total change of the government itself must take place, before the new system of defence can operate, further than to paralyze the old. An array cannot possibly be maintained in a state of discipline and efficiency, for any length of time, unless its pay be regular, and all its equipments complete: and this can never be the case, except in a state where the succession to the throne is settled, where the great majority of the population are of peaceable habits, and where establishments are permanent, and the laws respected, and administered upon principles which are understood, and not liable to be altered at the will of the sovereign, and of those to whom he delegates his authority. That a regular army may be instrumental, by the influence of its example, and habits of order, in promoting civilisation, there can be no doubt; but this change must coincide with many other reforms, or every effort to render it effectual to the great object of national defence will prove abortive, and terminate in disappointment. The reigning Monarch of Persia has been disposed to try this system by an observation of the advantages which the Russians derived from their discipline, and a belief that his subjects, if clothed, armed, and trained in the same manner, would be more equal to a contest with that nation ; and he has probably seen with satisfaction, the growth of a force, which is also calculated, fiom its formation, to increase his power over the more turbulent part of his own subjects: but it is perhaps fortunate for his kingdom, that this plan has not yet proceeded to an extent that can have seriously injured either the feelings or the efficiency of that irre gular army, to which Persia must (while her government remains unaltered,) trust principally for her defence against the attackTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. ^ of any Euiopean power. The means which this nation possesses chap.xxiii to resist such an attack are far from inconsiderable; but they are of a character which would not be improved by the partial intro duction of a new military system. They consist chiefly of natural obstacles, which nothing but a long period of time, and many radical changes, could overcome. The great proportion of the inhabitants of this kingdom must be civilized before they could be subdued. Neither the soil, nor the productions of the country, are of a nature to invite conquest: and its internal condition, connected with its relative position to the most warlike and barbarous of all the nations of Asia, would place the European state, which attempted that project, in a situation of more difficulty and embarrassment on the day that it was apparently accom plished, than on that on which it was commenced.504 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA.

There is, perhaps, no region in the universe of its extent which has a greater diversity of climate.

During the two first months of summer a strong north-westerly wind prevails over the whole of this tract, which, at times, blows with such violence that it brings with it clouds of a light, impalpable sand, from the oppo site shore of Arabia, a distance of more than two degrees. In the autumn the heats are more oppressive than in summer; but in winter and spring the climate is delightful. It is never very cold, and snow seldom falls on the southern side of that range of mountains by which it is divided from the other parts of Persia. The rains in this quarter, which are not heavy, fall in the winter, or early in spring. The prevailing winds are from the north-west and south-east; and rain is almost always accompanied by the latter, which, though often very violent, hardly ever continues above three or four days at one period. Some parts of the interior of the provinces of Kerman and Laristan are subject to extreme heats, particularly those districts of the latter which border upon the Desert of Seistan. The town and district of Shiraz, and the other parts of Fars above the mountains, enjoy a fine climate, and are neither subject to the oppressive heats of the lower and more southern parts of Persia, nor to that severity of cold which is experienced in the more elevated and northern provinces of that kingdom *. The * The summer at Shiraz is warm, but the heat is never excessive; and the nights, during the warmest weather, are cool and pleasant. When I was there in 1800,THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 507 temperature of this part of Fars varies according to the elevation chap.xxiv of the different vallies with which it is interspersed; but neither the heat nor the cold is excessive. The soil of the interior part of Fars is in general rich and productive. There are few large streams, but abundance of rivulets; and while its more mountainous districts afford excellent pasture for the flocks of those tribes by which they are inhabited, the vallies near Shiraz, and the other towns of the province, produce almost every kind of grain and of fruit in the greatest abundance. As we proceed northward into the extensive province of Irak, the climate improves; and Isfahan, once the capital, and still the principal city of that kingdom, appears to be placed in the happiest temperature * that Persia can boast. Its inhabitants are strangers to that heat which is felt, during some of the summer months, at Shiraz; yet their winter is hardly more severe. Except ing a few weeks in the year, the sky of this favoured region is unclouded and serene. The rains are never heavy, and the snow seldom lies long upon the ground. The air is so pure and dry, that the brightest polished metal may be exposed to it without being in one of the hottest days of June, Fahrenheit's thermometer was at noon 94°, in the house, and 100° in a tent. In May, 1810, it never rose at noon above 88°, nor was below 74°. In the morning, at eight o'clock, it generally stood about 60°. In autumn the heat continued; but in winter it became cold, the thermometer falling considerably below the freezing point. As late as March there was often a hoar frost upon the ground. April is a delightful month, the thermometer at sunrise being gene rally from 50° to 53°, at two p. m. 80° to 84°, and at nine p.m. about 64°. * Mr. Jukes states, that ' from the average of twenty-seven days, including the end ' of May and the beginning of June, the thermometer, at sunrise, was 56°, at two p. m. 87°, and at nine p. m. 67°.ghap.xxiv corroded by rust. The regularity of the seasons in this part of Persia appears quite extraordinary to a person accustomed to a more uncertain and variable climate; for they perceptibly change almost to the hour. When spring commences, there is, perhaps, nO spot in the world where Nature assumes a more lovely garb than at Isfahan: the clearness of its streams, the shade of its lofty avenues, the fragrant luxuriance of gardens, and the verdant beauty of wide-spreading fields, combine with the finest climate to render it delightful: and we are almost disposed, when we view this enchanting scene, to admit, that the hyperbole is not excessive which describes it as having an intoxicating effect upon the senses*. The northern cities of Irak do not enjoy so favourable a climate as Isfahan. The country about Hamadan is very mountainous, and * The Persians have at all times boasted of the climate of this capital. A merchant of that nation, who had travelled to every quarter, was residing at Delhi: and we are informed, that on being asked by the Emperor of India which he thought the best spot in the world, he answered, without hesitation, ' My own house.'—' Your own house!' replied the emperor, disappointed at not receiving that flattery which he had antici pated.—' Yes, please your majesty,' was the reply; ' and I trust I shall prove it to ' your satisfaction. You will allow,' he continued, ' that the fourth climate 7 is the ' finest on the earth.'—' I do,' said the emperor. —' The province of Irak is admit- ' ted, I believe, to be the finest in that climate, and Isfahan is the first city in Irak. ' Now,' said he, ' Saadut-abad is undoubtedly superior to every other ward in Isfahan, ' and my houseis the best in Saadut-abad.' The emperor smiled, and approved both of his logic and his patriotism. 7 By the geography of the ancients, which is the only system known in Persia, the habitable earth is divided into seven climates.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 509 the winter severe; while the Cities of Kashan* and Koom, which chap.xxiv are situated on the verge of deserts, are exposed almost to as oppressive heat in summer, as the countries on the shores of the Gulf. Teheran-f*, the residence of the king, which lies immediately under those ranges of mountains that divide Irak from Mazen- deran, is exposed to great vicissitudes of climate, and is not deemed salubrious. In Aderbijan, the summer is warm, and the winter J very severe: and in parts of Kurdistan, though situated more to the southward, so # The extraordinary difference of climate between this city and the neighbouring high Valley of Kohrood has been already noticed.—Vide Vol. I. page 4. The mean temperature of Teheran in the month of April, as taken by Fahrenheit's thermometer, was 66° at noon. In May, the thermometer was, in the morning, 67°; at two p. m. 76°; and at ten p. m. 72°: but the summer, at the capital, is subject to excessive heats; and the winter is very cold. The climate of this city, however, and its neighbourhood, is subject to more sudden changes than any other part of Persia. When encamped at Dhaung, about sixty-eight miles from Teheran, on the thirteenth of June, 1810, Fahrenheit's thermometer, which had been at noon 92°, fell at three p.m. to 60°; and at eight p.m., when on the march to Sugzeeabad, the wind set in from the north-west, and it suddenly became as cold as in winter. The difference of the thermometer from noon to twelve at night was about sixty degrees. The north west wind which had caused this great change, is sometimes called Baud-e-Shahery&amp;r, but oftener Baud-e-Cauc &amp;.s &amp;,n, or ' the wind from Caudis^n,' a mountainous district immediately to the north of Kazveen. This wind is common in winter, but not in summer ; and a storm of the kind we experienced, when it lasts any time, destroys all the fruit, and does great injury to the crops of grain. J Tabreez, the capital of this province, lies in north latitude 38® 10'. When encamped near this city in June 1810, we found the thermometer sometimes 68° at sunrise, 94° at two p. m., and 56° at ten p. m. The wind, at this season, blew strong from the eastward. The following account of the climate of this city is taken from a journal kept by Mr. Campbell who remained there during the winter of 1808.510 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap .xxiv great is the effect of elevation, that the winter may be said to com- mence with the autumn* of the surrounding country. The northern provinces of Persia, Ghilan and Mazenderan, have, like its southern, a cold and a warm region. The former is the higher or mountainous part, which borders on Irak and Aderbijan; and the latter, those plains that stretch along the shores of the Caspian. Both these provinces abound in forests and rivers, which may be said to be rare in almost every other part of Persia. Silk is cultivated in Ghilan, and in some parts of Mazenderan; but the latter country is most celebrated for its culture of rice, which is of very superior quality; and its producing this grain in such abun dance, is a proof that its soil and climate are essentially different ' On the twentieth of October we had a heavy fall of snow, which covered all the ' surrounding country; but it did not remain long upon the ground, for the weather ' again became mild, and we had no excessive cold until the middle of December: from ' which period, till the end of January, the thermometer, when exposed to the air at ' night, neVer rose above the zero; and in our rooms, at mid-day, it seldom rose above ' 18°. January was by far the coldest month. The water became almost instanta- ' neotisly solid in the tumblers upon the dining table. The ink was constantly frozen ' in our inkstands, although the tables were quite close to the fire. For at least a ' fortnight not an egg was to be had, all being split by the cold. Some bottles of ' wine froze, although covered with straw ; and many of the copper ewers were split by ' the expansion of the water when frozen in them. Towards the end of February ' the weather became comparatively mild; but on the first of May we had a fall of ' snow, and such cold weather, that it destroyed all the vegetation: afterwards the ' weather became very warm, and they began to cut their corn on the fifteenth of « July.' * I have before stated, (Vol. I. page 5,) that when encamped on the Plain of Hubatoo in Kurdistan, on the seventeenth of August 1810, the water froze, and the thermometer was thirty-eight degrees at sunrise. This plain is in latitude 36° north.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 511 from that of the other parts of Persia. The rains in both it and chap.xxiv Ghilan are frequent and heavy, and many tracts of the lower country are described as very moist and unhealthy. The great province, or kingdom, as it is often termed, of Kho- rassan, lias within itself every variety of climate: but all those districts which border upon the desert that stretches from Irak to Seistan are arid, and subject to extreme heats; and in some parts the inhabitants are, during a few weeks in summer, compelled to avoid exposure, lest they should be destroyed by the pestilential winds, or buried in the clouds of sand*, with which they are often * Captain Pottinger, who, in the beginning of April 1810, in his journey from India to Persia passed over a part of the desert which stretches into Baloochistan, has the following interesting observation upon the subject. ' The soil (if such it may be called,) is a very light red sand; the particles of which, ' when taken in the hand, are scarcely more than palpable: the whole is thrown (most ' likely by winds,) into a confused mass of waves of different dimensions, principally ' running from east to west. Many of these are very remarkable in their formation. ' On the opposite side to that on which the wind blows, where they often rise in nearly ' a perpendicular line to a very considerable height, they have, at a distance, the appear- ' ance of a new brick-wall: the side, towards the point from which the wind usually ' blows, (N. VV.) slopes off with a gradual declivity to the base (or near it,) of the next ' or preceding wave, which rises in the same extraordinary manner, so as to leave a ' hollow or path between them, the waves which it separates varying in height above ' it from ten to twenty feet on each side. ' I had considerable difficulty and fatigue,' Captain Pottinger continues, ' in get- ' ting my camels over these waves, especially where we had to ascend the perpendicular ' or leeward side of them : indeed, in several instances, we were obliged to desist from ' the attempt, and go round until a more favourable place or turn in the wave offered. ' On the sloping or windward side the camels got up pretty well ; and as soon as they ' found the top of the wave giving way with their weight, (which it invariably did if512 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap .xxiv accompanied: but, notwithstanding this partial evil, Khorassan may be said to possess a fine and salubrious climate. From what has been stated, we may pronounce, that, with the exception of the provinces on the shore of the Caspian, the climate of Persia, though very various, has every where the same quality of dryness, and purity of atmosphere. It has been before mentioned*, that this kingdom has hardly any great rivers, and does not abound in lesser streams, or springs. The consequence is, that it has few trees, excepting those which are cultivated. It, perhaps, owes some « of any size,) they dropt on their knees, and in that manner gradually descended with ' the sand, which was, luckily for us, so light and loose, that the first camel made a « sufficient path for the others to follow without difficulty. This impediment, however ' annoying, was nothing to the distress suffered, not only by myself and people, but « the camels, from the floating or moving particles of sand; a circumstance which I ' am quite at a loss to account for. On the first appearance of it, the desert seemed, « at a distance of half a mile, or even less, to be a flat plain from six inches to a foot « higher than the summit of the waves. This vapour, or cloud, appeared constantly to ' recede as we advanced, and at times was formed completely round us, conveying a ' most distressing sensation; and at the same time we were imperceptibly covered « with small sand, which, getting into our eyes, mouths, and nostrils, caused consider- ' able irritation, and was accompanied by severe thirst, which was greatly increased by ' the intense heat of the vertical sun, by which the sand was so heated as to blister ' our feet, (being obliged to walk,) though we had shoes on. On inquiry, my guide ' said, that it was supposed, by those who had seen these floating sands, that the violent ' heat caused the particles to rise, and that they, consequently, moved through the ' atmosphere: but as it was perfectly still, as far as I could judge, I am in doubts ' respecting the correctness of the guide's ideas on the subject, ahhough I certainly remarked that this phenomenon was more common during the heat of the day, than « either in the morning or evening ; so much so indeed, that I cannot say I evei saw it ' at either of the latter periods.' * Vide Vol. I. page 5.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 5l3 of its salubrity to this cause, as it is more free than other regions of chap.xxiv Asia from those vapours and exhalations which, though they fructify the soil, are often noxious to animal life: but this want of wood, while it diminishes the general beauty of the country, is felt as a most serious inconvenience by its inhabitants: and an observation of the fact compels us to subscribe to the justice of the remark of an intelligent Indian, who, on hearing some comparisons between the countries of Persia and India, which he deemed injurious to the latter, exclaimed: ' You Persians are continually boasting of your ' climate; but, after all, you have neither shade to protect you ' from the scorching rays of the sun in summer, nor fuel to save ' you from the effects of the piercing cold of winter !' Speaking generally, however, we may certainly pronounce, that the tempe rature of the interior provinces of Persia is delightful and healthy • though there are, no doubt, several parts of that kingdom which are subject to all the extremes of heat and cold, and others that are far from salubrious *. The surface of the soil of Persia varies, from the sandy and un productive plains on the shores of the Persian Gulf, to the rich * The natives of the more arid regions of this country, particularly those provinces which lie on the shore of the Persian Gulf, have almost all complaints in their eyes, occasioned, in some degree, by the constant glare of sunshinej and the absence of ve getation; but more, perhaps, by want of that cleanliness, which, rn such climes, is, beyond every thing else, conducive to health. Fevers are also frequent in this quarter, but not so much so as in some of the north-western provinces of the empire. Irak, Khorassan, and the inland parts of Fars, are among the healthiest parts of Persia: but, throughout that country, the robust frames and healthy appearance of the natives, are proofs in favour of their climate: and there is, perhaps, no nation among whom it is more rare to meet weakly or deformed persons.

Vegetable productions, chap , xxiv clayey soil on those of the Caspian; but it almost every where re- quires water to render it fruitful: and it is from this cause, more than any other, that the frequent invasions to which it has been exposed have tended so greatly to diminish the produce, and, con sequently, to check the population of that country. The destruction of a few water-courses, which have been made with great labour and expense, changes, in one season, a verdant valley into a desert plain. Few countries can boast of better vegetable* productions, or in greater variety, than Persia. Its gardens vie in beauty and luxuriance with any in the universe i and an idea may be formed, from what we observe of those parts of it that are highly cultivated, of the prosperity which that country might attain under a just and settled government. Some of its finest and most extensive vallies, which are covered with the remains of cities and villages, are consigned, as pasture grounds, to wandering tribes, to feed their cattle and flocks; and over an extent of a hundred miles, once covered with grain, there now appears only the few scattered fields which are deemed sufficient to furnish with food the families who have the range of the domain, and to give an annual supply of green shoots •f to fatten their horses. Persia does not abound in valuable minerals. Iron and lead, however, are found in many parts of that kingdom.

Persia has always chap. xxiv been indebted to other countries for the precious metals: and it is remarkable, that among a people whose sovereign deems the right of coining, his highest privilege, that foreign coins should form a considerable part of the currency * of his kingdom. There are no gems of any value found in this country except the turkoisf. Gems. The Gulf of Persia has several pearl fisheries, particularly that near Pearls, the Island of Bahreen: but we can hardly consider any of those fisheries as belonging to Persia; for though the monarchs of that nation have always claimed the sovereignty of this sea, they have at no period had a navy that could enable them to contend with the Arabian rulers of the opposite shore. Among the tame animals J of Persia, the camel, the mule, and Tameanimais. the horse, are at once the most useful and the most excellent. Oxen, which are only used to till the ground, are not abundant; nor Oxen, are they remarkable either for their size or beauty: but in a country of silver in Aderbijan; but those ores were not found in sufficient quantities to pay the expense of working them. * The Turkish piastre, the ducat, and the Venetian, are among the coins which are current in Persia. f The best turkois are found in a mine in the mountains near Nishapore, in Khorassan. ^ The elephant can no longer be numbered among the tame animals of Persia, as there are not above three or four in the kingdom, which have been sent as presents to the king. It is not probable that the elephant was ever indigenous to Persia : but there is no doubt that, from the most early times, they were known and used in war by its inhabitants; and we may conclude, from the sculpture at the Tauk-e-bostan, which was undoubtedly executed in the reign of Baharam the Fourth, that numbers of this noble animal swelled the pomp of the Sassanian monarchs.516 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap .xxiv where there are neither navigable rivers nor wheel carriages, it is natural that those animals, which are alike essential to promote the intercourse of peace, or to give success to the operations of war, should be the object of the peculiar care of the inhabitants. In all those parts of Persia where the soil is arid and sandy, and which are Camels, exposed to great heats, camels are preferred, for carrying burthens, to all other animals. In some districts * of Khorassan they may be said to constitute the chief wealth of the inhabitants: but, in Mules, almost all the other provinces of the kingdom, mules are in more general use; and their extraordinary strength and activity, combined with their power of enduring fatigue, places this animal, in the estimation of the natives of Persia, next to the horse, and their breed is hardly an object of inferior care. Horse?. A variety of horses are produced in Persia. The inhabitants of the districts which border on the Gulf still preserve pure those races of that animal which their ancestors brought from the oppo site shore of Arabia. In Fars and Irak they have a mixed breed from the Arabian, which, though stronger, is still a small horse, compared with either the Turkoman or Khorassan breed, which are most prized by the soldiers of Persia^. Both these latter races have * The Arab tribes who inhabit the countries which lie between the Persian Gulf and the mountains, breed a number of camels, but they are of an inferior kind to those produced in Arabia, and many provinces of India. f The price of horses in Persia varies extremely. The common horse is always to be purchased from fifteen to forty pounds : fine horses, particularly of the Turkoman or Khorassan breed, are, in general, very dear; a hundred pounds is a common price, and sometimes a much larger sum is paid. They are often valued more from their breed than their appearance.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. also a great portion of Arabian blood : but from the original animal chap .xxiv of the country where thej are reared being larger, and the pasture finer, they attain great size and strength. There are perhaps no horses in the world capable of enduring more fatigue than the Turkoman; and when trained, as they usually are, for predatory incursions, they carry their riders, for days together, the most sur prising marches*. The inhabitants of Persia were taught to value this race of animals by suffering from the inroads of the tribes by whom they are bred; and who, secure in the superior qualities of the animals that carried them, used to issue, in parties of twenty and thirty, from the plains they inhabit, on the eastern shores of the Caspian, and plunder the villages in the vicinity of the Cities of Kashan and Isfahan. Sheep are very abundant in Persia. The wealth of the wander- sheep, ing tribes consists in the number of their flocks : but they give no attention to the improvement of the breed of this useful animal, which affords them food, and some of the most essential articles of their raiment. Though dogs be deemed unclean by Mahomedans, Dogs, the qualities of this faithful animal have overcome every prejudice; and we find them in Persia, as in other countries, admitted to a companionship with man. They are chiefly cherished by the wan dering tribes. They watch their flocks, guard their tents, and aid them in their field sports. Some of the dogs of this country which * I have before mentioned (Vol. II. page 24L) the great distances which the Turkoman horses carry their riders.

Persia, like every country of which many parts are desolate, abounds in wild animals; among which may be numbered the lion, the wolf, the jackal), the fox, the hare, the wild ass, the argali, or « wild sheep/' the mountain goat, and deer of a variety of kinds. We also find in this kingdom almost all the birds that are common to countries which lie in the same latitudes. Population. It appears quite impossible to make a calculation of the amount of the population of Persia from any information that we yet possess of that country; and we are taught to be very diffident in even offering a conjecture upon this subject, by the difficulty which we know to exist, in cases where there appears to be every means to aid us in forming a correct opinion. The calculations which the Persians themselves make of the population of their country are exaggerated beyond all credit. In a manuscript, which professes to be taken from state papers in the reign of Shah Sultan Hussein, and which enters into all the details of the numbers of the dif ferent tribes and citizens, the total amount of the subjects of the Monarch of Persia is gravely stated at upwards of two hundred millions! An European traveller *, who made his estimate near a century earlier, expresses his belief that the inhabitants of that kingdom are about forty millions: but an eminent geographerf, on the conclusion that the population of Persia and Candahar does not exceed that of Asiatic Turkey, computes their number at ten # Chardin. f Pinkerton.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. millions; of which he thinks four may be allotted to the provinces of chap .xxiv Candahar, and six to what he terms Western Persia, or, in other words, the limits of the present kingdom : and this estimate is pro bably not very remote from truth. It gives about one hundred to the square mile; and, though some parts of Persia may far exceed that calculation, there are large tracts of desert which are totally uninhabited. There are, no doubt, many and powerful checks upon population in Persia. the unsettled state of the government, its oppression, the continual civil and foreign wars; and, above all others, the debauch ery and vice of a great proportion of the inhabitants, and the consequent neglect of their offspring. But, on the other hand, when we consider the salubrity of the climate, the cheapness of provisions * the rare occurrence of famine, the bloodless character of their civil wars, their obligation to marry, and the comparative small number of prostitutes, we may conclude that the population of this country has not diminished so much within the last century as is generally supposed. Great changes have taken place in the condition of cities, and many numerous tribes have removed from their former spots of residence; but in most cases they have only been trans planted to other parts of the kingdom. Within the last twelve years the number of the citizens of Isfahan has nearly doubled f, in conse- * Barley is often sold in Persia at one farthing per pound, and wheat is not on the average more than a third of the price dearer than barley. A cow is from sixteen to twenty shillings; a good sheep from six to eight shillings ; a goat from two to four shillings: and other articles of provision in proportion. t The population of this city, when it was the capital of the Suffavean Kings, was, if we can credit the European travellers by whom it was visited, between six520 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap , xxiv quence of the excellent local administration of that city, which has Vs '^ v ' w induced its former inhabitants to return from the villages near the mountains, where they had taken shelter from violence and oppression. In Persia, as in other parts of Asia, male offspring are desired beyond all other blessings, even by the lowest ranks; but female children, though not equally esteemed, cannot be deemed a burden upon their parents, in a country where celibacy is unknown, and where the poorest are seldom in want of food» It is also to be remarked, that in all Mahomedan countries charity is so strictly enjoined as a religious duty, that a considerable proportion of the superfluous means of the rich is always distributed among the poor: and this must have its effect in encouraging population ; for there is no fact more certain, than that that will always keep pace with the means of subsistence. The circumstance of the Persians being allowed to emigrate at pleasure to adjacent countries, where many of them find profitable employment, is also calculated to add, in a slight degree, to their numbers, as it removes one check to their increase. Though the population of Persia has perhaps diminished in a very considerable degree since the invasion of the Affghans, it has, no doubt, increased within the last twenty years, and may be said to be, at this period, rapidly increasing. But this observation only applies to the Mahomedan inhabitants of that country. Ihe de spised Jews are much decreased in numbers; and the persecuted and seven hundred thousand.

The colony of Armenians, settled in a suburb of Isfahan, which formerly amounted to two thousand five hun dred families, some of whom were of great opulence, do not now amount to five hundred, none of whom are wealthy; and this race has diminished in a still greater proportion in all other parts of the empire. The whole of the Armenians in Persia are calculated, in an estimate made of their number by order of the Bishop of Julfa, to amount to twelve thousand three- hundred and eighty-three souls, which is said to be not more than a sixth of their number before the AfFghan invasion*. Persia has in all ages been remarkable for the magnificence and Magnificence splendour of its cities. Isfahan, which was for several centuries the ofisfah^ capital of this kingdom, though it has ceased to be the royal resi dence, is still the most populous. When viewed at a distance, the lofty palaces, and the domes of the numerous moscjues and colleges of this city, derive additional beauty from being half veiled by shady avenues and luxuriant gardens. Though the first impression be weakened by a nearer view, and by the con templation of the ruins of former grandeur, enough remains to excite great admiration. The fine bridges over the Zainderood are still in good repair ; almost all the colleges have been preserved ; and many of the former palaces are yet perfect; while some new ones I owe this enumeration of the Armenian population in Persia to Captain Frederick, who obtained it from the Bishop of Julfa. The statement made out by the bishop is very particular, and has every appearance of being correct. vol. ii. 3 xTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. have lately been erected by the present governor * as if to tempt the reigning monarch to make this city once more the royal residence. No buildings can be more striking than some of these palaces. The front room or hall is in general very open, and supported by pillars that are carved and gilded in the most exquisite manner; while the large glass windows, through which it receives a mellow light, are curiously stained with a variety of colours. Before each of these palaces is an open space, with a fountain, near which the domestics stand to watch the looks and words of the lord of the dwelling, who is generally seated at one of the windows. The Ch&amp;r-Bagh, or ' the great avenue/' which has received the name of the Four Gardens, has been already described f- Several of the private palaces that are built on the borders of this avenue, though uninhabited for more than a century, are still in good repair, and their appearance adds to the beauty of the city. The style of the architecture of these palaces is light and pleasing, though neither regular nor magnificent: and they have, at a dis tance, a very picturesque effect, from being surrounded with gardens and fine avenues. Every principal market in Isfahan is covered with an arched roof; and, while ample room is left on an elevated space on each side for a display of goods, there is a road in the centre for passengers, whether on foot or on horseback. The principal caravansaries or inns of this city are excellent solid buildings; and many of the public baths are very splendid, being of great size, and paved with marble. The private houses are in general # Hajee Mahomed Hussein Khan. t Vide Vol. I. p. 621.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 523 good; and those which are inhabited by the governor and other chap xxiv public officers, or opulent merchants, almost vie with the palaces. These, like all Asiatic houses, present outwardly no appearance but that of high and dead walls, without aperture or window. One large door or gate is usually the only approach. In the interior there is a court, which, if large, is laid out in walks, the sides of which are planted with flowers and refreshed by fountains. To this court all the principal apartments of the mansion which are inha bited by men open ; and adjoining, but completely distinct from this court, is a smaller one, around which are the inner apartments, belonging to the females of the family. To promote a free circula tion of air in summer, every house of this description has a high triangular building *, which rises far above the terraced roof, and is open at the top; it receives the wind in whatever direction it blows, and by this means the different apartments are ventilated : in winter these are warmed by stoves, which are constantly supplied with burning charcoal. Almost every dwelling of any consequence in Isfahan has a garden belonging to it. This, while it adds to the salubrity and beauty of the city, must greatly increase its extent, and reconciles us to credit the account which states, that in its more pro sperous days its walls were twenty miles in circumference -f.

The Town of Hamadan, once so famous under its ancient name of Ecbatana, has few beau ties to attract the attention of the traveller. The small dome which canopies the remains of Mordecai and Esther, and the modest tomb of the celebrated physician Avicenna, stand near the centre of this city. The former, as has been stated, continues to be an object of veneration to the Jews, and the latter is visited by all travellers who respect the memory of learning and genius. Many of the other cities of Persia are as remarkable for the excellence of their buildings as for the romantic beauty of their situation. Their site is usually upon small rivers or streams, and surrounded with gar dens. Almost all the towns in Persia have a defence: this is generally a high mud wall, which is flanked by turrets, and some times protected by a deep dry ditch and a rude glacis. In every city or town of Persia there are one or more public caravansaries for the accommodation of travellers. These edifices, which are also found at every stage on the principal roads of the kingdom, are in general built of stone or brick : their form is square, and the whole of the interior is divided into separate apartments: their walls, * The environs of Shiraz have always been considered beautiful. The palace and garden of Jehan Nem^h, and that of Tukht Kujureah, as well as the gardens at the tombs of Hafiz and Sadi, are -all places of public resort. The cluster of gardens at Musjid-e-Burdee, which belong to the inhabitants of this city, extend in length about five miles, and in breadth nearly two : they abound with every variety of the finest fruits.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 525 which are very high, are usually defended by towers, that they may chap.xxiv be secure against the attack of robbers. The houses in Persia are almost all built of mud, and have terraced roofs. Their inner apartments are usually better than their external appearance indi cates. The smaller villages are in general very rudely constructed; and the common huts have often, instead of a terrace, a dome roof, that is made to avoid the necessity of using wood, which, it has been before stated, is throughout this country a very scarce article. There can hardly be said to be any roads in Persia; nor are they Public roads, much required, for the use of wheel carriages has not yet been intro duced into that kingdom. Nothing can be more rugged and difficult than the paths which have been cut over the mountains by which it is bounded and intersected. The great benefits that would be derived from good roads has often been suggested to the Persians; but they have a reluctance to adopt an improvement which they believe, and not without reason, would destroy one of those natural obstacles by which their country is defended from invasion. The only excep tion to this observation is a broad road or causeway, which has been made, with great labour, over the Kaufel4n-koh a lofty and romantic mountain, which divides Irak from Aderbijan -f: and this * The river Koozuloozun winds along the foot of the Kaufel&amp;n-koh : a bridge has been built over this fine stream; and the scene has recently acquired more interest, from its being that near which the late ingenious traveller, Mr. Brown, was murdered by some banditti. f The Kaufelan-koh is usually described as the boundary between these two pro vinces ; but at present the district of Kalkul, which contains near one hundred and fifty villages, and is situated to the southward of the mountains, is considered as belonging to Aderbijan.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap .xxiv labour is attributed to the Turks, who, when in possession of the latter province, desired to facilitate their further attacks upon Persia. Useful and The more civilized and peaceable classes of the inhabitants of fine arts. p ers i aj dwell in cities, towns, and villages, have made consider able progress in both the useful and fine arts: but it appears from their productions, and the accounts we have received from European travellers, that they were as far advanced several centuries ago as they are at this moment. This is not so much to be attributed to the internal distractions of their country, or to their prejudices, as to the form and character of their government. Men who live under a rude despotism can only be happy by reconciling themselves to their actual condition ; every effort at improvement is attended with danger to the individual by whom it is made. If a new branch of commerce is discovered, the gains of those who have embarked in it are likely to be over-estimated, and they become exposed to the cupidity of power. If an individual exhibit superior skill as a manu facturer, his labour is liable to be seized by the monarch, or by the provincial despot that rules under him *: and the promulgation of new principles of science, however just, subjects the person to all the hostility of that formidable class, whose rank in the community is grounded upon their supposed pre-eminence in knowledge, and who are disposed to treat a serious attack upon their dogmas as a crime that is hardly less than heresy. With these obstacles to prevent the progress of improvement, there is nothing to encourage it. * I have known several instances of this occur, even under the reigning monarch,, whose rule is comparatively mild and just.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. Amid the vicissitudes to which they are liable, few persons look char: further than to provide for their own welfare. The history of Persia affords numerous instances of men being led, by religious sentiments, or a desire of fame, to disburse great sums in charity: and many, even among the lower classes, who have acquired wealth, have wished to perpetuate their name by building caravansaries, baths, and other structures of public utility. But they neither profess nor entertain any feelings connected with the general good of their country : all their views are avowedly personal: and, from the character of their government, it is impossible that they can be otherwise. A monarch, or a prince, may, from the excellence of his disposition, or the goodness of his understanding, indulge in plans of improvement: but even his views are limited by his condition ; and he desires to effect the work of half a century* in one or two years. His precipitation produces failure: for that which depends upon system, cannot be effected by power. Be sides, all great improvements are gradual: and even when they are introduced, the society must take the shape to which they are suited, or they cannot be permanent. The above reasons will account for the inhabitants of Persia hav ing made no essential progress in the arts of civilized life. That # I observed to a very ingenious Persian who was employed in casting cannon, that some of the guns he had just made appeared to me to be imperfect, and that one seemed rather crooked. He replied, it was very true, but that it was not his fault: he had been commanded to do the work of ten months in ten days. ' Byt why ' do not you represent the impossibility of doing so ?' said I. He shook his head, and said, he knew better.

Its commerce is nearly the same as it was in the most ancient times. The silks of Ghilan, the wool of Carmania, and several vegetable productions^, are still exported. The specie received for these, pays for the shawls of Cashmere, the indigo and printed cottons of India, the sugar of Batavia and of China, and the woollens of England. In reading the descriptions of the agriculture of Persia that have been given by travellers at different periods, we discover little or no alteration in that important art. The means which the natives of that country now employ to till the ground are probably those which were used by their ancestors in the most remote ages. They have, at all periods, been peculiarly well skilled in the construction of canals and wells; an essential art in so arid a country. But the chief atten tion of the Persians is devoted to their gardens : and their success has been proportionate to their labours. Their vegetables and fruitsf, of which they have a great variety, are excellent. The latter may be said to form, during the season, part of the daily food of the lowest classes of the inhabitants of this kingdom J. * There is a considerable export of cotton, gall nuts, and of asafoetida, from Persia. The cotton and gall nuts are chiefly the produce of Irak; the asafoetida, of Khorassan. -j- In 1800, the finest grapes were sold in the market at Shiraz at less than a half penny per pound; and other fruits, particularly melons, were still cheaper at Isfahan. In some parts of Persia fruit has hardly a value. ^ It has been before stated, that extensive fields are appropriated in the neighbour hood of Isfahan for the culture of melons; and the country round that city is decorated with handsome pigeon-houses, which are kept up at a considerable expense, to obtain what is deemed the best manure for this favourite fruit.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 529 Many of the manufactures of Persia are beautiful, particularly chap.xxiv their gold and silver brocades, their silks, and their imitation of Manufactures Cashmere shawls, which are made of the wool of Kerman. They make a variety of cotton cloths, but not of an equally fine texture as those of India. They have also several manufactories of glass, and some of a coarse ware resembling china; but their efforts have not yet succeeded in bringing these wares to any perfection. In mechanical arts the Persians are not inferior to the other Mechanism, nations of the East; but they do not surpass them. They work well in steel; and their swords, though brittle, are of an excellent temper and edge. They also make fire-arms, and cast cannon; and would soon rival Europeans in this branch of manufacture, if it were possible that a government, so constituted as that under which they live, could give adequate encouragement to men of science, and to the ingenuity of its own subjects. In the arts of carving and gilding few nations are more skilful. They also enamel upon gold and silver in the most beautiful manner: and their ornaments, which are made of these metals and precious stones, often display admirable work manship. Chymistry, as now understood in Europe, is unknown in Persia; chymistrj. but the occult science of alchymy continues to be the favourite pur suit of some of the most learned of that country. The philoso pher's stone, which, for ten centuries, occupied the attention of the wisest men of the western hemisphere, still deludes those of the East. The Persian alchymists make their experiments with the greatest secrecy, lest others should share in the wonderful discovery which they hourly expect will reward their labour.

In physic the Persians are still the pupils of Galen and Hypo^ crates, whom they call Galenous and Bocrat. They are totally * The mountain of Alwund near Hamadan is supposed to produce some plants that are essential to the process of finding the philosopher s stone ; and the consequence is, that many persons in that city waste their life in the pursuit. A few years ago, one of its rich inhabitants was assured, by a poor man, that he had made the glorious discovery: « But,' said he, ' if I, who am known to be poor, should suddenly exhibit wealth, the u secret from whence I have obtained it will be guessed, and I shall be seized and tor- « tur ed till I reveal it. Now, if you,' he added, ' possessed it, the knowledge could be « attended with no such danger. I will, therefore,' he continued, ' trust you with the « communication; and if you are satisfied, after repeated experiments, that I have told « truth, you can give me a small portion of the wealth you must acquire, and I will ' proceed and end my days in devotion at the shrine of the holy Aly, where, from its ' being under the Turkish government, I shall be safe from that danger to which my « fortune, in making this discovery, continually exposes me.' The whole of this state ment appeared so reasonable, that the person to whom it was communicated granted a ready belief. He was made acquainted with all the materials which were to be put into the crucibles except one, termed ' the earth of B&amp;.deoos:' but this, his informer assured him, was not only obtained at the mountain of Alwund, but in several other parts of Persia, and, being useful for many purposes, was to be found in most markets. He was, however, entreated to send his servants to inquire into the correctness of this statement. They went, and brought back some of the earth, which they had purchased at a veiy moderate rate. When every thing was ready, the experiment was made, and gold was produced. The merchant was rejoiced; but, to prevent deception, it was repeated, and with the same result. All doubts were removed, arid he was only anxious to pay the purchase money of the secret, and get rid of his partner. The man, the relator of this anecdote states, was contented with two thousand tomans, and proceeded to the Turkish province of Bagdad. The merchant, after he was gone, determined to commence making more gold ; but he was not a little surprised to find, that those shopkeepers who badTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 531 unacquainted with anatomy and the circulation of the bloodand chap.xxiv their skill in surgery is consequently as rude as their knowledge of medicine. They class both their diseases and their remedies under four heads: hot, cold, moist, or dry: each may contain one or two of these qualities: and the great principle they maintain is, that the disease must be cured by a remedy of an opposite quality. If, for instance, an illness has arisen from moisture, dry remedies must be given: and hot diseases are alone to be cured by cooling medicines. Their classification of diseases appears very arbitrary: but they are in general so bigoted to their own practice, that, though disposed to place great confidence in European physi cians, they are reluctant to attend to their prescriptions when in opposition to their favourite systemf. The Persian physicians are sold the Khak, or ' earth of Badeoos/' were gone. He, however, thought it possible that, though that essential ingredient was not at Hamadan, it might be found, as his friend had told him, in other cities. His correspondents at Shiraz, at Teheran, and Isfahan, received letter after letter, desiring them to discover and purchase all the KMk-e-Badeoos they could. No person had ever heard of its name. The rage and distraction of the merchant soon led to a discovery of the fraud that had been practised upon him. The cunning fellow, who had made him his dupe, had filed down thirty or forty pieces of gold into some baskets of earth, which he had dignified with a fine name, and given to some associates to sell. He was, however, beyond the reach of justice: and the merchant had to sustain, in addition to his pecuniary loss, the ridicule of all acquainted with the story. * The Prince Abbas Meerza sent two young Persians to England about four years ago; the one was directed to study painting, the other medicine, and the art of surgery. The former unfortunately died. The latter, whose name is Hajee Baba, is still in Eng land prosecuting his studies, and promises, from his intelligence and industry, to fulfil the object for which he was sent. t Mr. Jukes, in a MS. upon this subject, observes, that when at Isfahan in 1804, .1 lilliWWllip4 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap .xxiv acquainted with inoculation for the small-pox, but it is little prac- though the ravages of that dreadful disease often threaten whole towns with depopulation ; and notwithstanding their sufferings from this calamity, all the efforts of humane and skilful surgeons resident in that country have not yet succeeded in making them sen sible of the great benefit of vaccination *. The principal men of the kingdom listened with rapture to the accounts they received of this great and important discovery, and appeared at the moment to desire that their country should benefit by its introductionf: but, though a wish to promote the happiness and welfare of the people is often expressed, and sometimes felt, by Asiatic rulers, we can hardly expect, in a government so constituted as that of Persia, that steady ulcerated sore throats were very common ; and that he apprehended many patients died because the physicians had decided it was a ' hot disease, and therefore was to be cured by bleeding and all other cooling remedies. He mentions also some cases of dysentery, where he in vain recommended mercury. It was a hot remedy, the Persian physicians said, and could never be proper where the disease was also hot. Ice and cooling draughts were administered, and several died whom he conceived might have been saved, if their prejudices, with regard to their system of physic, could have been overcome. # A chief of a tribe assured an officer belonging to the British mission who visited Persia in 1810, that he had been told that some particular pastoral tribes were exempt from the small-pox ; but though he was positive of the fact, he could give no particular account of the habits of those supposed to be exempted from this disease: but as many of these tribes have a number of cattle, the assertion had, perhaps, some foundation in truth. f Nothing can exceed the persevering humanity with which Mr. Jukes endeavoured to introduce vaccination into Persia. His efforts were unremitted for several years: they were defeated more by the apathy of the government towards the general good of the community, than the prejudices of the people.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 533 and persevering ardour for the general good of the community, which chap.xxiv can alone give complete success to the introduction of this great and extraordinary blessing. What has been said of their knowledge of physic, only applies to the more civilized part of the inhabitants of Persia who live in cities and towns, and a great proportion of whom have received some educa tion. Those who dwell in tents are seldom attended by regular pro fessors of this art; but, as their diet is simple, and they take constant exercise, they are subject to few complaints, and for these every old man and old woman * of the tribe have a remedy. Sometimes, like the ignorant and superstitious of other countries, they trust more to their saints than their doctors. When the British mission that visited Persia fifteen years ago, was in Irak, the English gentlemen belonging to it were shown a few pieces of bread, covered with oil, which were * When I returned from the Persian court in the winter of 1800, almost every in dividual of the mission became blind, from the glare of the snow, with which the country was covered. The recovery was certain, but tedious : and, when blind myself, I listened with delight to a message from the lady of a chief, in whose house I was a guest, which imported, that she knew a certain and a speedy remedy, provided I would consent to permit her servants to apply it. When I expressed my readiness to do so, a large vessel, full of snow, was put before me, and I was desired to place my face near it: a red hot stone was then thrown into the vessel, and the sudden dissolu tion of the snow caused a very great perspiration, which was increased by a cloak being pulled at the same moment over my head. This remedy, (which was adminis tered twice,) though very disagreeable, proved efficacious, and my sight was com- pletely restored. It appears that they have a similar remedy in North America when the eyes are affected by the snow, as it is stated, in the Travels of Captains Lewis and Clarke, that, on such occasions, « they sweat the part affected, by holding ' the face over a hot stone, and receiving the fumes from snow thrown on it.'— Vide Quarterly Review, No. XXIII. page 330. *9' wmm534 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap .xxiv laid upon a rock, as an offering to a saint; and they were told, that they might, by these pieces of bread, compute the exact number of sick in the black tents that were pitched near, as this offering was the usual, and almost the only effort made to obtain their recovery from any disease^' with which they were attacked. In cases of surgery the treatment is very rude: but the abste mious habits, and consequent healthy state of body of the patient, often obtain extraordinary credit to the untutored practitioner. Though the regular physicians in Persia generally adhere strictly to the dogmas of their Grecian master, as explained and enlarged upon by Abou Aly-ben-Senna, (the Avicenna of Europeans,) and others of their most learned doctors, they boast the discovery of many new remedies. Salivation is quickly produced, by inhaling, through the common pipe of the country, a lozenge made of cinnabar and flour 'f*: and this speedy mode of affecting the system is universally practised, where the case is deemed of a nature to require it. In this country, as in all others, there are many quacks in medi cine, who obtain money or respect by pretending to cure all com plaints :j;. Some of these boast an hereditary right to certain * When passing through Kurdistan, in A. D. 1810, I was told by the chief of a rude tribe in that country, that his followers had only one medicine, which was a pur gative, in which the chief ingredient was the fat of a sheep's tail.

It answered « very well,' he added, ' in all complaints; and it saves us a great deal of trouble, ' and the expense of doctors.' t Mr. Jukes s MS. % I find, in Mr. Jukes's Journal, the following remarks upon the supposed practice in Persia of cold immersion for fevers: ' Dr. Currie,' that gentleman observes, ' in the 2d volume of his Medical Reports,THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 535 nostrums.

The first person to whom I applied for informa- ' tion &gt; was a well-informed man, who had made medicine his particular study/and was ' at least acquainted with all the theories of disease, if he had hot a very extensive « practical knowledge. He told me, that he never had heard of the application of cold ' water to the bod J ,n fever, and spoke confidently of its not being the general prac- ' tice of the modern physicians in Persia: tepid water to drink, and warm water, in ' which the leaves of the willow had been infused, to bathe the hands and feet, was ' more agreeable to their system of treating fevers; except in quartan fevers, when he ' informed me, that cold water was sometimes dashed unexpectedly upon the patient, ' and cured him. In continued fevers, however, he told me, that he had never heard of ' it; but in very hot weather, he said, it was admissible, and even proper, to keep the « patient cool; and that cold water, in which the willow leaves had been infused, ' might be sprinkled round where the patient lay. When I mentioned to him the ' case of Sir John Chardin, and the manner in which he had been so successfullv ' treated at Lir, he seemed quite astonished, and said, * It could only have been had ' recourse to by knowing that Sir John was an European from a cold climate, and that ' cold, therefore, was congenial with his nature: for if,' added he, 1 the same person ' had been a native of a warm climate, the physician would, in all probability, have ' ordered him the warm bath.' I have heard, however, of one physician in Persia, ' who allowed his patients with continued fever to eat as much ice as they chose; but ' the use of the cold affusion seems to be quite unknown at the present day. ' According to the theory of the Persian physicians, however,' Mr. Jukes adds, ' it ' would appear to be very admissible; for it is a favourite maxim of theirs, that dis- ' eases are to be cured by remedies directly opposite in their qualities to those of the536 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. ciiAP .xxiv curing the ague, which is a common complaint in that country, by beating the patient in a very unmerciful manner. Their success in this practice is said to be great. It must remain with those who are skilled in the medical art to determine how far it is possible that this rude treatment can have the effects ascribed to it *. In the higher branches of science the modern Persians know no more than their ancestors.

When first there, the chief of that place, whose name was Hedayet Kooli Khan, saw one of the gentlemen belonging to the mission lying down in the tent, ill of a quartan ague; he anxiously begged I would allow him to cure him; and being interrogated as to the remedy, he said he would beat him with sticks till he was well. The invalid declined the experiment; at which the chief was not a little offended, and brought numbers of his followers to swear that they had been recovered by his blows. Hed^lyet Kooli, when I last visited this place, was dead. He had left ten sons; of whom the eldest, Mahomed Aly Khan, was chief of the tribe. I inquired of this young man if he had succeeded to the knowledge of his father in medicine. 44 His practice,' he said, ' was equally successful.' I asked him particularly how he treated his patients. ' I tie them up,' said he, ' by the heels, ' when the cold fit is on, and bastinado them most severely, scolding them at the same ' time, so as to produce heat and terror, instead of a cold fit.'—' And you succeed ?'— ' Always.'—' Have you any other patients but your own followers ?'•—' A few : those ' in the neighbourhood who have any sense, come to me when they are ill of the ' ague.'—'Can any of your brothers cure fevers?'—' No! no!' replied he quickly, ' that is a gift or privilege confined exclusively to the head of the family.'THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. skilled injudicial astrology; a science in which the whole nation, chap from the monarch to the peasant, have the greatest faith. The system of Ptolemy, both with respect to the forms and motions of the heavenly bodies, and the shape and surface of the earth, is that in which they believe. Efforts have recently been made to convey better information to them upon this important branch of human science. An abstract of the Copernican system, and the proofs which the labours of Newton have afforded of its truth, have been translated into Persian; and several individuals of that nation have laboured to acquire a knowledge beyond what their countrymen possess upon this noble but abstruse subject; but it is not probable that these rays of light will soon dissipate the cloud of darkness in which a prejudiced and superstitious nation have been for centuries involved. The Persians can hardly be said to understand geography as a Geogra science; for, independent of their erroneous impressions regarding the form of the earth, their knowledge of its surface is limited to an imperfect acquaintance with the territories of those kingdoms that are in their immediate vicinity; nor do they understand the art of surveying in a degree that could enable them to lay down, with any exactness whatever, that portion of the globe which they themselves inhabit. We can add little to the various accounts which have been given Literature of the literature of the Persians. With the introduction of the Mahomedan religion that nation received all the learning of the Arabians of the seventh century ; and we find that soon after that period their writers, in every branch of literature, attained an excel lence which has not been surpassed by their descendants. Their vol. ir. 3 z538 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap.xxiv works on theology are very numerous; and it has been shown, i n a former Chapter*, that they are well skilled in all the arts of polemics. The character of their histories has been already given *f*. The style of their most esteemed writers in this branch, though often hyperbolical, is generally correct, and sometimes eloquent. The Persians, like all Eastern nations, delight in tales, fables, and apophthegms : the reason of which appears obvious ; for where liberty is unknown, and where power, in all its shapes, is despotic, knowledge must be veiled to be useful J. The ear of a despot would be wounded by the expression of direct truths; and genius itself must condescend to appear in that form in which alone its superiority would be tolerated. * Vide Vol. 11. page 351. f Vide Vol. I. page 275. J The Persians boast of the great good which their most eminent moralist Sadi has produced, by the rare union of fancy, learning, urbanity, and virtue : his tales, which are appropriate to almost every event that can occur, convey the most useful lessons; and his maxims have acquired an authority among his countrymen that render them almost equal to laws. The object of this poet and philosopher was to recommend good works to men, and justice and clemency to their rulers. In one of his admoni tory odes to the former he beautifully exclaims, ' Haif bur £in ke ruft ou k&amp;.r n&amp;. s^kht: ' Kous-e r^hillet zud ou b&amp;r n&amp; sEltkht' ' Alas! for him who is gone and has done no good work : ' The trumpet of march has sounded, and his load was not bound on.' In his lessons to monarchs he has the following impressive stanza ; ' Rahim koon ou be fouj dir tuskheer b&amp;.sh. ' Dilhiiee aullum gheer ou Sh^he Aullumgheer b&amp;sh.' ' Be merciful, and learn to conquer without an army. ' Seize the hearts of the world, and be acknowledged its legitimate sovereign.'THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 539 The Persians derive their knowledge in ethics from the Grecian chap.xxiv school. They deem Aristotle their master; and the principles of the Stagyrite are laid down as tenets, which it would be almost sacri lege to doubt. One of their most able writers in this branch of philosophy is Nasser-u-deen, who has been before mentioned His celebrated treatise on morals contains a series of philosophical disser tations upon wisdom, propriety of conduct, happiness, virtue, and the means of averting and of remedying evil f: but this eminent and learned man, though he has acquired great local fame for his skill in every science, was, like all his countrymen, a stranger to those won derful improvements which have resulted from the study of experi mental philosophy. It has been already stated that the Persians are, as a nation, poetry, devoted to poetry. They appear at that stage of civilisation when the minds of men dwell with the most enthusiastic rapture on that enchanting branch of literature; and they can boast of poets who are worthy of all the admiration which they are so forward to grant them. In the noble epic poem of Ferdosi, which has so often been referred to in the early part of the History of Persia, the most fastidious European reader will meet with numerous passages of exquisite beauty. The narrative of this great work is generally very perspicuous; and some of the finest scenes in it are described with simplicity and elegance of diction. In the opinion of Persians ♦ Vide Vol. I. p. 406. t In Persian treatises upon morality and philosophy the reader is often amused and instructed by a series of anecdotes, extracted from their biographical and historical works, which are classified so as to illustrate, by examples, ever}' virtue and vice to which the human condition is liable. v \540 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. H D chap.xxiv this poet excels in his description of the combats and battles of his heroes: but, to those whose taste is offended with hyperbole, the tender parts of his work will have most beauty, as they are freest from this characteristic defect of Eastern writers. It is, however, to be observed, that the most extravagant flights of Ferdosi do not excite that disgust which we receive on a perusal of his countless imitators; for so many of his characters are endowed with super natural powers, that the mind is almost reconciled to hear their deeds related in a language which appears mere bombast, when used to describe the actions of beings of an inferior order. As an epic poet, Nizcimee is deemed next in rank to Ferdosi: and the subject of his principal work, the Life of Alexander the Great, has afforded him an ample scope for all the vigour of his genius, and the richness of his imagination. Among the didactic poets of Persia, Sadi certainly ranks the highest: but it is difficult to class the numerous candidates for superiority in those mystic and lyric productions in which this nation has, in all ages, delighted. The Musnavee of Jellal-u-deen the Poems of Jdmi, and the Odes * The author of the M usnavee is generally called the Moollah of Room; while Hafiz is usually known by the title of Khaujah. The Persians conceive that the former far surpasses the latter in penetration and judgment. I have heard their opinion of these two celebrated Sooffee poets illustrated by the following anecdote.—' A learned person,' they say, ' was asked how it came that the author of the Musnavee and Hafiz, two ' Sooffees, had expressed themselves, in the commencement of their works, so oppo- ' sitely on the subject of divine love; Hafiz having said, ' The path of love appeared ' at first easy, but afterwards proved full of difficulties —while, according to JeMl-u- ' deen, ' Love at first appeared like a murderer, that he might alarm all who were ' without his pale.' The learned man replied, with a smile, ' That which the Moollah ' saw at first was only found out at last by the Khaujah.'' — Persian MS.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. of Hafiz, which have been already noticed *, are perhaps the most popular; but the names of Rudiki, Anveri, and several others, are nearly on an equal rank; and some more modern writers have attained great eminence in this favourite theme of oriental poets. Many of these poems are remarkable for harmony of numbers and luxuriance of imagination; but they all abound with the most ex travagant and hyperbolical passages; and the enraptured dreams of their visionary authors can only be esteemed beauties by men whose imaginations keep pace with that of the poet, whom they deem inspired, and whose most obscure lay is often considered by their enthusiastic admirers as the gleaming of a sublime know ledge, which is far beyond the comprehension of the profane and unenlightened. Many discussions have arisen regarding the real and mystical meaning of the writers of this class, and particularly of Hafiz, whose Odes are chanted as songs, to excite the young and the dissipated to pleasure, and recited as hymns to remind the old and the devout of the rapture of divine love. It has been shown, in a former chapter, that, among many classes of SoofFees, the natural feelings which man has on earth, and the immortal longings of the soul after its Creator, are deemed inseparable: and, with a poet of this persuasion, it was likely that the subjects should be so blended, as to render it impossible to distinguish when he meant to sing of earthly or of heavenly joys. Among the innumerable volumes of Persian poetry, we do not meet with any one of length that can be entitled a satire. This is, no doubt, to be referred to the condition of the society, which will • Vide Vol. II. p. 399.542 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap .xxiv not admit of that freedom of observation and expression which can alone give excellence to this species of composition. Ferdosi, under the impulse of rage and disappointment, wrote some satirical verses upon Mahmood* of Ghizni, which are only remarkable, as they show the keenness with which he felt neglect, and the bitterness of his resentment. Anveri, and several other eminent poets, have written satirical epigrams, many of which are remarkable for their point and severity. An unknown author has written a satire of some merit upon money •f, as the universal passion of the human mind: but this even has no title to the name of a satirical poem. Songs. Some of the Persian songs are very beautiful: they are chiefly composed on local subjects. Many of the lesser odes of the most celebrated poets of that country may be included among their songs, as they are set to music, and sung in all assemblies. Music. The Persians deem music a science; but it is one in which they do not appear to have made much progress. They have a gamut and notes, and a different description of melody, that is adapted to various strains, such as the pathetic, voluptuous, joyous, and warlike: the voice is accompanied by instruments, of which they have a number: but they cannot be said to be further advanced in this science than the Indians, from whom they are supposed to have # Vide Vol. I. page 340. t I have seen a copy of this poem, in which almost every condition of life is described. The satirist, after giving the professed liberal objects of the persons labouring in their different vocations, concludes every character he draws with the following line: ' Humma uz pai een ast ke zer mee khauud.' ' It is all from this, that the man wants money.'THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 543 borrowed it. Their strains are often pleasing; but they are always chap .xxiv monotonous, and want that variety of expression which gives much of its charms to this delightful art. In painting the Persians appear to have advanced little within Painting, the last three centuries, for we observe several of the figures in the palaces at Isfahan, which were built in the reign of Shah Abbas, that appear as well executed as those of the most eminent of their modern artists. Their colours are very brilliant: and when they draw por traits, they usually succeed in taking likenesses. Some of their lesser drawings, which are highly glazed and painted on wood, display equal industry and taste: but they are yet unacquainted with the rules of perspective, and with those principles of just proportion which are essential to form a good painting. From what has been said regarding the actual condition of the useful, and fine arts in Persia, we can neither pronounce that the present inhabitants of that country are in a state of progressive improvement, nor assert that they are less advanced than theft forefathers. All that men have gained under a powerful and wise monarch, has been lost under his weak or barbarous successors. If a period of peace has invited intelligent strangers to the shores of this kingdom, they have been soon banished by returning war. Knowledge in Persia has hitherto ebbed and flowed with the changes m the political situation of that empire, and must con tinue to do so as long as its inhabitants are under the depressing influence of a despotic, and unsettled government. -mTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. CHAPTER XXV. Observations on the Manners and Usages of the Inhabitants of Persia. In an attempt to describe the manners and usages of a nation, we must commence with those exalted ranks, whose example has always so powerful an influence upon the other branches of the community. The customs and ceremonies of the Court of Persia have, within the last three centuries, undergone no substantial change. The circum stance of the reigning family being hereditary chiefs of a warlike tribe, and still preserving many of the usages of that condition, constitutes almost the only essential difference we find between their personal habits and the customs of their court, and those of the Suffavean kings, whose manners and usages have been minutely described by the numerous European travellers* who visited Persia when they occupied the throne of that kingdom. It has been before stated -f-, that, from the period of Shah Abbas the Great, the princes of the blood were immured in the haram, where their education was intrusted to women and eunuchs; and, until the death of the king, his destined successor was unknown. # Chardin and Koempfer have both minutely described the forms and manners of the Court of Persia during the period that the Suffavean kings ruled that country. f Vol. II. page 431.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. It has also been observed, that the son of the lowest-slave in the haram was deemed, at that period, equally eligible to succeed to the throne as the offspring of the proudest princess. The usage of the families of Tartary has always been different. Great respect has invariably been paid by them to the birth of the mother. The cause of this is obvious. Intermarriages are deemed one of the prin cipal means of improving the friendship, and terminating the feuds, between the tribes of that nation; and the fulfilment of this object has required, that the descendants of a high-born mother, who was a legitimate wife, should have prior claims to those of a common concubine, otherwise the relations which were established by those ties must have proved sources of discord instead of union. The Kujurs, who are proud of their Tartar, or, as they term it, Turkish origin, maintain, in this particular, the usage of their ancestors. Mahomed Hussein Khan, the grandfather of the present king, when he took refuge with a Turkoman chief, proudly refused the daughter of his protector*, because she was not of sufficient high descent to give birthf to a race that were to contend for a throne: and the present king, as has been mentioned, has declared his second son. Abbas Meerza^, the heir of his crown, on the express ground of his claims by his mother, who is a high-born female of the same tribe as the sovereign. * Persian MS. t It is a common saying among the Tartar tribes, that « a man should choose ' his wife from a noble family, that his sons may emulate their maternal uncles.' t The mother of the eldest of the king's sons, Mahomed Aly Meerza, was a Georgian. VOL. II. 4 ATHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. According to the modern usage of Persia, the princes of the blood are not immured within the walls of the haram beyond that period in which they require female attendance and maternal care. They early learn the forms of their religion ; and at three or four years of age can repeat a few short prayers, and are perfect in their genuflections and mode of holding their hands when occupied in devotion. They are also most carefully instructed in all that belongs to external manner. They are taught how to make their obeisance to a superior; how to behave to a person of equal rank, or an inferior; as also the manner in which they are to stand in the presence of their father and monarch; and the way in which they are to seat themselves, if desired, and how to retire. These forms are deemed of great consequence at a court where every thing is regu lated by ceremony: and it is not unusual to see a child of five years of age as perfect in his manners, and as grave in his deportment, in a public assembly, as the oldest person present. When the young prince is between seven and eight years of age, he begins to read Arabic and Persian. As soon as he understands the alphabet of the former language, he peruses the Koran; after which he learns the essential tenets of his religion. His mind is early imbued with the importance of those doctrines which distinguish the Sheah faith from that of the Soonee: and one of his first lessons teaches him to regard the latter with abhorrence. When the royal pupil is considered to be well grounded in religion, Persian books are put into his hands; and the works of Sadi, while they give him an early taste for fables and poetry, are expected to inspire his young mind with a desire of virtuous fame. He is also put through a superficialTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. ^ course of grammar, syntax, logic, syllogisms, sacred law, and philo- charxxv. sophy: but his progress in those higher branches of a Persian education depends chiefly upon his own disposition. He seldom learns more than to write and read with ease and fluency, unless inclined to study, which is not unfrequently the case, for supe rior attainments as a scholar* always add to his reputation. The greatest care is invariably taken to instruct Persian princes in all their bodily exercises. They are trained, while yet children, to the use of arms; and ride, when six or seven years of age, with grace and boldness. They are often betrothed when very young, and sometimes married long before they attain the age of puberty: after that period, the number of their wives and females depends upon the means which they have of supporting them. When a prince is raised to the throne, his time is divided between his public duties, the pleasures of the haram, and his amusements: the period he bestows on each of these is regulated by his peculiar inclinations, his age, and his habits. No general description, therefore, can exactly explain usages which are liable to continual changes : but a short sketch of the manner in which the reigning monarch passes his time, will convey a full idea of those habits which are deemed suited to his elevated condition. An attention to religious duties, which no King of Persia can Manner in openly neglect, requires him to rise early. As he sleeps in the JLtthS interior apartments, to which no male approaches, his attendants are either females or eunuchs. After he is dressed with their aid, he sits from one to two hours in the hall of the haram, where his * The reigning king is said to be a good scholar. He is also a poet. I am in possession of a dewan, or book of odes, of which he is the reputed author.548 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xxv. levees are conducted with the same ceremony as in his outer apart- ments. Female officers * arrange the crowd of his wives and slaves with the strictest attention to the order of precedency-f*. After hear ing the reports of those intrusted with the internal government of the haram, and consulting with his principal wives J, who are generally seated, the monarch leaves the interior apartments. He is met, the moment he comes out, by officers in waiting, and proceeds to one of his private halls, where he is immediately joined by some of his principal favourites, with whom he enters into familiar conversation; and all the young princes of the blood attend this morning levee to pay their respects. After this is over, his majesty calls for breakfast. The preparation of all the royal meals is superintended by the chief steward of the household ||. The viands are put into dishes of fine china§, with silver covers, and placed in a close tray, which is locked # There are numerous female officers in the haram whose name and duties nearly correspond with those who have the care of ceremonies, and the charge of maintaining order in the public court. t According to the best account I have been able to obtain of this ceremony, the fair strangers, if any have been brought, first pay their obeisance by a low bow, and are placed where their royal master can best view their charms. After these, the Georgian slaves and numerous mistresses are ranged before him, agreeably to their respective ranks. % When the king is seated on his throne in the public hall of his haram, no one but the most favoured and highest born of his legitimate wives are allowed to sit in his presence. It is said, that two only of the wives of the present king enjoy that privi lege; the mother of the heir-apparent. Abbas Meerza, and the daughter of Ibrahim Khulleel Khan, formerly chief of Sheshah. [| The Persian name of this officer is Nauzir. § It is deemed wrong for a rigid Mahomedan to have his victuals served in dishes of silver or gold: but this rule is not always observed.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. and sealed by the steward. This tray, after being covered by a rich chap. shawl, is carried to the king, in whose presence the steward breaks V, ^ v his own seal, and places the different dishes before him. Some of the infant princes are generally present, and are indulged with a participation in this repast. The chief physician is invariably in attendance at every meal. His presence is deemed necessary, the Persian courtiers observe, that he may prescribe an instant remedy, if any thing he eats should disagree with the monarch : but this precaution, no doubt, originates in that suspicion which continually haunts the minds of those who exercise despotic power. A description of the manner in which the King of Persia dis charges his ordinary public duties, has been already given*. When these are performed, he usually retires to the haram, where sometimes he indulges in a short repose. His majesty always makes his appear ance in the outer apartments some time before sunset, and either again attends to public business, or takes a ride on horseback. His dinner is brought between eight and nine, and the same precautions and ceremonies are used as at breakfast. He eats, like his subjects, seated upon a carpet, and the dishes are placed on a rich embroidered cloth that is spread for the occasion. It was the usage of some of the former Kings of Persia to indulge openly in drinking wine; but none of the reigning family have yet outraged the religious feeling of their subjects by so flagrant a violation of the laws of Mahomed. Bowls filled with sherbet, made of every species of fruit, furnish the beverage of the royal meals: and there are few nations where * Vide Vol. II. page 434.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 550 chap . xxv. more pains are bestowed to gratify the palate with the most delicious viands. After dinner is over, the king retires to the interior apart ments, where it is said that he is often amused till a late hour by the singers and dancers of his haram. It is, however, impossible to speak of his occupations from the moment he passes the threshold of his inner palace. He is there surrounded by a scene calculated, beyond all others, to debase and degrade the human character. He only sees emasculated guards, and their fair prisoners. He hears nothing but the language of submission, or of complaint. Love can not exist between beings so unequal as the monarch and his slave: and vanity must have overcome reason, before the fulsome adulation of pretended fondness can be mistaken for the spontaneous effusions of real attachment. The harams of the Monarchs of Persia are governed by the strictest discipline; and that must be necessary to preserve the peace of a community, where all the arrogance of power, the pride of birth, the ties of kindred, the intrigues of art, and the pretensions of beauty, are in constant collision. The usual routine of the life of a King of Persia is often interrupted by the urgency of public affairs, and sometimes by pursuits of amusement. The reigning family have hitherto dis dained those enervating and luxurious habits which led the last monarchs of the Suffavean dynasty to confine themselves to their harams. They not only, as has been stated, attend personally to public affairs, but continually practise manly exercises, and pursue field sports with all the ardour of a race of chiefs who cherish the habits of their Tartar ancestors. The present King of Persia is an expert marksman, and an excellent horseman.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. ool few weeks pass without his partaking in the pleasures of the chap. xxv. chase *. The Monarch of Persia has always an historiographer, and a The king's his- chief poet. The one writes the annals of his reign ; and the other, Ind^oef 6 ' who has a high rank at court, composes odes in his praise, and cele brates, with grateful ardour, the munificence of his royal patron. A giant and a dwarf were, at one period of the present reign, part of the royal establishment; and that is never without a jester, who en- His jester, joys a very extraordinary latitude of speech, and assumes, both in his dress and manner, the habit and appearance of folly. It is usual to laugh at the witticisms of those jesters, even when they are most severe; and the sovereign himself professes to respect their pri vilege. Kurreem Khan, as has been before statedf, belonged to one of the native tribes of Persia who speak a language which, from its * The favourite game in Persia is the deer, of which there are several kinds. That which is nsually hunted is the antelope, an animal that may be termed the fleetest of quadrupeds. A common mode of hunting them is with hawks and dogs, which are trained to aid each other. Two hawks are flown when the deer is at a great distance : they soon reach it, and strike alternately at its head. This annoys and interrupts the rapid flight of the animal in so effectual a manner, that the dogs come up, and seize it. It is also usual to surround the antelope with a number of horsemen, each of whom holds a dog in a slip. When the antelope tries to escape, the object is to intercept it: and though no dog, however swift, can reach this species of deer at the commencement of the chase, it is turned out by fresh ones being continually slipped. In this mode of hunting the antelope, the object is to bring the game near the king, who usually holds in a slip a favourite dog. Hawking is a favourite amusement in Persia. Bustards, hares, herons, and partridges, are the usual game. When engaged in this sport, the king generally carries a hawk on his hand. Shooting game is also very common. It has been before stated that the Persian soldiers are excellent marksmen. This is an accomplishment which it is a disgrace not to possess. f Vide Vol. II. page 122,552 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xxv. rudeness, is universally denominated by the other inhabitants of that nation ' the barbarous dialect This prince, as he was one day sitting in public, commanded his jester to go and bring him word what a dog, which was barking very loud, wanted. 1 he courtiers smiled at this sally of the monarch. The jester went, as desired; and, after appearing to listen for some time with profound attention, he returned, and said, with a grave air, ' Your majesty must send one ' of the chief officers of your own family to report what that gentle- man says : he speaks no language except 4 the barbarous dialect/ ^ with which they are familiar, but of which I do not understand one ' word.' The good humoured monarch, we are told, laughed most heartily at this ridicule of the rude dialect of his tribe, and gave the wit a present, as the reward of his retort. This anecdote, to which many similar might be added, will show that there is little difference between the office of jester at the modem Court of Persia, and that which some centuries ago existed at every Court in Europe. A resemblance of trifling forms even merits attention, as it leads to con clusions on the progress of knowledge, and the condition of society: and we may perhaps judge as correctly from the character of their amusements, as from their more serious occupations, of the degree of civilisation that a people have attained.

But the art of relating stories is, in Persia, attended both with profit and reputation. Great numbers attempt it, but few succeed. It requires considerable talent, and great study. None can arrive at eminence in this line except men of cultivated taste and retentive memory. They must not only be acquainted with the best ancient and modern stories, but be able to vary them by the relation of new incidents, which they have heard or invented. They must also recollect the finest passages of the most popular poets, that they may aid the impression of their narrative by appropriate quotations. The person whose peculiar office it is to amuse his majesty with these stories, is always # Derveish Suffer, of Shiraz, is one of the best narrators of stories, as well as reciter of verses, that I have known in Persia.

It is equally his duty to beguile the fatigue of a long march or to soothe the mind when it has been disturbed by the toils of public affairs: and his tales are artfully suited to the disposi tion of the monarch, and the humour he is in at the moment. Sometimes he recites a fable of the genii; at others, he speaks of the warlike deeds of the former Sovereigns of Persia, or recounts the love of some wandering prince. A story of more coarse materials is often framed, and the ear of the king is entertained with a narrative of low and obscene adventures. There is no court where a more rigid attention is paid to cere mony than at that of Persia. The looks, the words, the motion of the body, are all regulated by the most strict observance of form. 'When the king is seated in public, his sons, ministers, and courtiers, stand erect, with their hands crossed, and in the exact place of their rank. They watch the looks of the sovereign, and a glance is a mandate. If he speaks to them, you hear a voice reply, and see their lips move, but not a motion nor gesture betrays that there is animation in any other part of their frame-f.

They are as particular in their forms of speech as they are in other ceremonies ; and superiority and inferiority of ranks, in all their shades, are implied by the terms used in the most common expressions. On extraordinary occasions nothing can exceed the splendour of the Persian court. It presents a scene of the greatest magnificence, regulated by the most disciplined order. There is no part of the government to which so much attention is paid as the strict mainte nance of those forms and ceremonies, which are deemed essential to the power and glory of the monarch ; and the high officers * to whom this duty is allotted, are armed with the fullest authority, and are always attended by a number of inferiors, who carry their commands into the most prompt execution. The arrival of a foreign embassy is deemed one of those occasions Ceremonies at on which the King of Persia should appear in all his grandeur. The ceremonies with which these were received, appear to have been bassaclors - substantially the same at every period of the history of that kingdom. The present monarch has endeavoured to vie with the most magnifi cent of his predecessors in his reception of those ambassadors of the European nations by whom his court has been visited. The foreign minister advances, with his suite and escort, to one of the interior gates of the palace. The moment that he reaches the precincts of the royal abode, all is complete silence. The horses even, as if trained to the scene, hardly move their heads. When he dismounts, * The names and duties of these officers are little altered since the period of Chardin and Kcempfer; and both these travellers have given minute accounts of them.556 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap .xxv. he is conducted into a small apartment, where he is met by one of the principal officers of government. After being seated there for some minutes, the king is announced to be upon the throne, and the ambassador proceeds to the hall of audience. That splen did room, the floor of which is raised about eight feet from the ground, is situated in a garden, intersected by regular walks and fountains; along which, from the throne to the entrance of the gar dens, the princes, ministers, nobles, courtiers, and royal guards, are arranged in their respective ranks: but the splendid appearance of these officers, who are robed in their richest habits, is eclipsed in a moment, when the eye glances at the sovereign, whose throne and dress are covered with the richest jewels. As the ambassador ad vances between two officers, whose gold enamelled wands are the insignia of their high stations, he is twice required to make an obeisance*. When near the throne, the lord of requestsf pronounces his name, and that of the ruler by whom he is sent. The king says, in reply, ' You are welcome and the foreign minister proceeds to take his seat in the same room, but at some distance from the king.

If the ambassador has any presents to offer, they are (however rich) received without any appearance of gratification; for the most extraordinary works of art must not appear to excite surprise, or to fix the attention of the monarch, when they are publicly presented. The forms of his condition require that he should display an apparent indifference to all such offerings, and that he should conceal any joy, or wonder, that has been excited in his mind, till he can indulge in it without witnesses. It has been before stated, that there are no wheel carriages * in Persia. The monarch always rides f, unless he be prevented by indisposition ; and then, if forced to move, he is carried in a litter f, that is suspended between two mules. The tents and portable pavilions of the King of Persia are very magnificent.

I replied, that the King of England was remarkable for his attention to virtue and morality, and had none. He laughed heartily, and said, he should not like to be^a king where such usages prevailed. This sally of the monarch was intended to place me at my ease, and to do away the formality of a visit of introduction. * When I visited Persia in 1810, I made the king a present of a handsome curricle with which he was, at the moment, much delighted. f The King of Persia has two or three elephants; and he has, for some years past, appeared seated upon one of them, when he attended the annual races at the festival of Nouroze. t It is in this kind of conveyance, which is called Tukht-rowan, and upon large panniers, called Kujawul, which are carried by camels, that the ladies of the king, who attend him when he takes the field, are conveyed.558 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xxv. surrounded with a high tent wall, which encloses both the outer an( j i nner apartments. The same forms, and the same usages, are observed when he is in the field, as when at his capital: but it is to be supposed that on active service his female tram must be greatly reduced.

There is no part of the establishment of a Monarch of Persia to which more attention is paid than his horses. These are placed under the charge of an officer of rank, who is styled Meer -a-Khour, or ' the lord of the stable.' The finest colts, from every part of his kingdom, are sent to the king; and from these he selects what are deemed the best, for his own riding.

This usage continues in force; and, during the present reign, a nobleman f of the first rank in the king dom, who had aspired to the throne, took refuge in the royal stable, and remained there till he obtained pardon for his offence. The military tribes in Persia have always regarded this sanctuary with the most superstitious reverence. — ' A horse/' they say, ' will ' never bear him to victory by whom it is violated J.'

The same writer remarks, when speaking on this subject, « The monarch or chief at whose stable a criminal takes refuge must feed ' him as long as he stays there; but he may be slain the moment before he reaches it, ' or that on which he leaves it; but when there, a slave who has murdered his master ' cannot be touched.

As Sheahs, they profess great vene ration for the memory of Aly and his sons; but not being able to visit their tombs, which are within the Turkish territories, they content themselves with sending rich presents to ornament these shrines. It is also an object of ambition to be buried at these sacred places. The body of Aga Mahomed Khan, the late King of Persia, was sent to Kerbelah, that it might be interred near the sacred precincts of the dome which canopies the remains of the sainted Imaums, Hussein and Hussun. It has been before stated that the Eed-e-Nouroze, or ' the feast ' of the vernal equinox/' is to this day observed with as much joy and festivity as it was by the ancient inhabitants of Persia. This single institution of former days has triumphed over that intolerant bigotry which destroyed the religion on which it was grounded ; and the Mahomedans of Persia have chosen rather to be upbraided with the impious observance of what their enemies term an usage of infi dels *, than abolish a feast which was so cherished by their ancestors. They have, however, discovered another reason for celebrating this day; it is the anniversary of the elevation of their favourite Aly to the high dignity of the caliphate. There are many fabulous accounts regarding the origin of the feast of Nouroze. The Guebers, or worshippers of fire, who were the former inhabitants of Persia, computed by the solar and not by the lunar system: their year was divided into twelve months; and every day of the month, as well as the month itself, had a name taken from those which they give to the angels. It was a custom of the ancient Kings of Persia, * The Turks continually upbraid the Persians with their observance of a feast instituted by the worshippers of fire. Niy ''Sk ''WaWe. ro Ml (THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 561 we are told, to dress in a particular robe each day. Scarlet, richly chap.xxv. embroidered, or rather wove with gold, was the appointed dress for the day Hormuzd% which was the Nouroze, or the day of the vernal equinox. Many reasons are stated, to show why the Nouroze is kept as a festival. God, one author-f* says, on that day began the creation, and ordered the different planets to move in their various orbits. Another writer affirms, that Jemsheed J built the palace of Persepolis, and entered it on this day, which he or dered in future to be kept as a joyous feast. These and many other equally fabulous accounts, are given of the origin of this festival: but the fact is, it is the opening of the spring, the day on which winter is over, and the season of gladness commences. It is the custom of the King of Persia to march out of his capital on the Nouroze, attended by his ministers, nobles, and as many of his army as can be assembled. The ceremonies of the day commence with a review, and then the tribute and presents of all the rulers and governors of the different provinces of the kingdom * Persian MS. f Persian MS. X According to another account, equally fabulous, Jemsheed, the fourth king of the Paishdadian race, whose name was originally ' Jum' one day pitched his jewel- ornamented throne on an eminence, in the province of Aderbijan; and, after placing the crown upon his head, sat down with his face towards the rising sun, the reflection of which, from the jewels of his crown, shed a lustre which dazzled all around, and they exclaimed ' sheed,' which means ' lustre.' This title of sheed was added to his name; and the day on which the Nouroze took place, the twenty-second of March, was termed Nouroze, and kept as a feast. It is, however, unfortunate for the author of this popular etymology, that 'jum' should be an original Arabic word, and ' sheed' a Persian term; and their combination, therefore, to form one name or title, is very improbable. vol. ii. 4 c562 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xxv. are laid at the foot of the throne, which is placed in a magnificent tent, that is pitched for the purpose in an open plain. The king remains in camp several days, which are passed in joy and festivity. Horse races* are among the amusements at this period; and the monarch, whose favourite horses generally win, gives pre sents to the fortunate riders : he also confers dresses of honour on all the chief nobles and officers of his government, who, imitating his example, give similar marks of their regard to their servants and dependants. This feast is kept with equal demonstrations of joy over every part of the kingdom. It continues nearly a weekf; but the first day is the most important. On it all ranks appear attired in their newest apparel; they send presents of sweetmeats J to each other; and every man kisses his friend on the auspicious morning of the Nouroze. * Horse-racing has always been deemed an amusement worthy of the particular patronage of the Kings of Persia; and there are annual races, not only at the capital, but at all the principal cities of the kingdom. The distance they have to run is accord ing to the age of the horses ; but it is seldom less than seven miles, or more than tvyenty-one. The object of these races is not so much to try the speed as the strength of the horses, and to discover those that can be depended on for long and rapid marches. The horses are always rode by boys between the age of twelve and four teen. Mares never run at the races in Persia, nor are they used in that country for military purposes, except by the Arab tribes, who, like their brethren in Arabia^ give them a preference. The exact time of the continuance of the festival of Nouroze does not appear fixed. The rejoicings sometimes last six days, at others only three ; and those who have neither money nor time to waste in display and idleness, are content with an observance of the first day, which is that of the vernal equinox. J There is, perhaps, no country where the inhabitants live so much upon sweet meats as in Persia. Among these, the finest is that called guzangabeen, which is madeThe Persian Kings have always attached great importance to the chap. xxv. royal privilege of having a band of musicians, and of displaying at &amp; Banners and their festivals, and when encamped with their army, particular ban- arms of Per- ners. It has been before mentioned *, that one of the standards of' the ancient monarchs of this kingdom was the apron of Kdwdh, the celebrated blacksmith, who rebelled against Zohauk, and placed the virtuous Feridoon upon the throne. Subsequent to the introduction of the religion of Mahomed a variety of colours or flags have been adopted, which have in general been ornamented with symbols allusive to the deeds of that prophet or his descendants. Among these, a re presentation of the Zulfekdr, or two-edged sword of Aly, has been the most common : but, notwithstanding the attachment of the Persians to this sacred banner, the sovereigns of that kingdom have, for many centuries, preserved, as the peculiar arms -f- of their country, the sign of the honey of the guz, or tamarisk tree, mixed with some flower and sugar. This honey is produced by an insect, or small worm, which resembles a white thread. It lies on the leaf of the tree, and appears inert. During forty days jn summer the insects are brushed off the leaves every three days, and they always collect again in astonishing numbers. The guzangabeen is chiefly found in Irak. I received the above description of it from an English gentleman, who saw the insect on the tree when travelling through that province. ♦ Vide Vol. I. page 19. t The causes which have led to the sign of Sol in Leo becoming the arms of Persia cannot be distinctly traced ; but there is reason to believe that the use of this symbol is not of very great antiquity. We meet with it upon the coins of one of the Princes of the Seljookian dynasty of Iconium ; and, when this family was destroyed by Hulakoo, the grandson of Chenghiz, it is not improbable but that prince, or his successors, adopted this emblematical representation, as a trophy of their conquest; and that it has remained ever since among the most remarkable of the royal insignia of Persia.

The nature of absolute power requires that it should be supported by a continual revival of the impression of its high and almost sacred character. Many of the usages of Persia are calculated to produce this object: every thing connected with the royal name or authority is treated with a respect that is increased by the form and opinion have enabled me to make this conjecture, states his belief that the emblematical representation of Sol in Leo was first adopted by Gheat-u-deen Kai Khoosroo-ben-Kaikobad, who began to reign A.

These are presented to the regiments with great ceremony.

I The medals which have been struck with this symbol upon them have been chiefly given to the Persian officers and men of the regular corps who have distin guished themselves in the war with the Russians. An English officer who lately served with these troops informs me, that those on whom these medals have been conferred are very proud of the distinction, and that all are extremely anxious to obtain them.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. ^ 565 which attends it. If the king sends an honorary dress, the person chap.xxv. for whom it is intended must proceed several miles to meet it, and clothe himself in his robes of favour with every mark of gratitude and submission*. If a firmaun, or mandate, is written by the monarch to one of the officers of government, it also is met at a distance by the person to* whom it is addressed; who, after raising it to his head, gives it to his secretary to read, and all stand in respectful silence till the perusal is finished. If a minister has occasion to mention the king, it is not unusual, after insert ing all his titles, to leave a blank, and to write the royal name at the top of the letter, lest it should be degraded by having even a word above it. A short time ago a picture of the reigning monarch was sent to the ruler of Scind. It was enclosed in a case, and nailed down on a litter carried by two mules: but, though not visible, it was deemed entitled to the respectful homage of his subjects in those countries through which it passed. On the approach of this 'picture to Abusheher, the governor of that port, with all his troops and attendants, went a stage to pay his obeisance f. When it came near, they dismounted from their horses and walked forward to meet it on foot: the governor kissed the conveyance, in token of his * The-princes of the royal family are not exempted from paying this mark of respect.

There can be no doubt that the whole of this ceremony was conducted in exact conformity to orders from court; for so great is the attention to minute forms in Persia, in all points connected with the king or his family, that it is usual, when they depute an officer on any public service, for some per son in authority to direct, by letter f, the exact ceremonies and attentions with which he is to be received and treated. * The trowsers and shifts of the females were exhibited on almost every house at Abusheher, as a sign of their joy. This extraordinary custom prevails among all the tribes of Arabians settled in Persia. f The following is a translation of a letter from Mahomed Nubbee Khan, vizier to the prince, at Shiraz, to his brother, Jaaffer Khan, Governor of Abusheher, conveying instructions for his reception and treatment of the nobleman who was appointed mehmander, or ' entertainer,' to the mission under my charge. « My dear brother!—Hussein Khan Kujur, who is appointed mehmander to « General Malcolm, is a nobleman of the first rank and family: he will keep you « informed of his progress.

The forms observed in his inter- course with the viceroys of provinces and governors of cities, be- observed' by fore he reaches the capital, are deemed equally important. The ZTo^L manner of meeting him before he enters a town, and the mode Inltt of his reception at the different houses that he visits, are subjects s r X arabas ' of the most serious discussion and minute arrangement. The rank and number of persons sent to welcome him, the distance they go, and the period at which they dismount, are all of importance, as they mark the exact degree of respect and consideration in which he is held : and at his first interviews with princes of the blood or nobles of high rank, the inclination of the head, the rising from the seat, the advancing to the edge of the carpet, to the door, or even beyond it, and the place where he is to be seated, are considered as forms of the utmost consequence, and are therefore always settled by previous agreement. Ceremonies of this kind have every where some importance; but they are most attended to by nations who, like Persia, have no correct knowledge of the character and condition of distant countries, and whose impressions are chiefly formed from the appearance and conduct of those by whom they are repre sented. If an ambassador assumes great state, the nation he represents is considered to be wealthy and powerful: if he exacts attention, and resents the slightest neglect, his monarch is believed to be lofty and independent, and worthy of that friendship which he disdains to court by any sacrifice of dignity or of honour; while a contrary proceeding on the part of a public representative is certain to lead to opposite conclusions. It is not unusual to568 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xxv. hear a Persian nobleman or minister pass an eulogium on the extraordinary knowledge, firmness, and spirit, of an ambassador of his own country, or of a foreign state: and when yon expect to be told of some remarkable negotiation or treaty that he con cluded, you are informed, that his great knowledge was displayed in not being overreached in some point of form, and that his firmness had withstood every effort to make him contented with one shade less of attention, than he thought his due. The conduct of individuals on these occasions is deemed connected, not only with their own fame, but that of their country: and the best Persian historians have recorded, with honour, the names of the ambassadors who have been most alive to what their station de manded on these essential points of etiquette. We may complain of all this, and deem it at variance with sound reason, which con siders substance more than form, and is better pleased with manly simplicity than vain pomp and display: but it would be as rational to expect that the Persians should understand, on first hearing it, the beauties of our language, as that they should appreciate, at the first stages of our intercourse with them, the superior value of our customs. Besides, in a community where every thing is personal*, high rank must, to support itself, always assume an imposing attitude. The natives of the East term the gorgeous magnificence which surrounds their kings and chief rulers ' the clothing of the state -f.'—' You * When I have spoken to sensible Persians regarding the opposite nature of their government and institutions to those of England, I have always received the same answer: Kar-e-shoomd ba hikmut ust; kar-e'ma ha zat; i. e.

Persian to an European gentleman, who asked him some question upon this subject; ' but if you desire to be understood by my coun- ' trymen, you must address their eyes' The princes, nobles, ministers, and high public officers of Persia, imitate the king in many of their usages. All the respect they pay to him they exact from their inferiors : each of them in his rank has what may be termed a petty court; the forms of which are regulated in nearly the same manner, and by officers bearing the same names, as those who attend the monarch. Every chief, or officer of ele vated station in Persia, has his haram, his secretaries, his officers of ceremonies, his master of horse, and sometimes his poet and his jester; and in his house, all matters of ceremony are regulated with as strict an attention to punctilio as at the palace of the sovereign. This class of men, sensible of the precarious nature of their condition, appear alike desirous of obtaining money and of spending it. They seem eager to crowd into their hour of good fortune all the enjoy ment they can. They lavish their wealth in a manner not dissi milar to those of the same rank in other countries: women, horses, rich arms, and dress, are the principal objects of their desire. Their splendid apartments are ornamented with rich carpets, and are generally so situated as to be perfumed by flower gardens, and refreshed by fountains. One of their pleasures is to sit in these apartments to enjoy their coffee and tobacco, and feast their friends. It is the habit with the ministers of the Persian court to breakfast and dine almost every daj^ in a large partj^. Their meals are always abundant, and sometimes sumptuous; and it is not vol. ii. 4 D570 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xxv. unusual to invite persons of the most unequal condition to partake of them The higher ranks among the inhabitants of Persia are in general educated in exactly the same manner as the princes of the blood; and they are most carefully instructed in all that belongs to exterior manner and deportment. Nothing can exceed their politeness: and in their social hours, when formality is banished, their conversation is delightful. It is enlivened by anecdotes; and their narratives and observations are improved by quotations of beautiful passages from their best poets, with whose works almost every Persian who possesses any intelligence is acquainted. The chiefs of military tribes may be termed the hereditary nobility of Persia. The monarch, as has been stated, may, by his influence or direct power, alter the succession, and place an uncle in the situation of a nephew, and sometimes put a younger brother in the condition of an elder: but the leader of the tribe must be of the family of their chiefs. The title of khan, or lord, is conferred upon such persons as a matter of course. When a son is born to a noble of high rank, he is often honoured with this title when his birth is announced at * I have dined with the Prime Minister of Persia when nobles of the highest rank, inferior meerzas, or clerks, merchants, mendicant poets, and astrologers, have been of the party. When Captain Stewart, Secretary to the British Mission that visited Persia in 1810, was sitting with the present minister, Hajee Mahomed Hussein Khan, in his tent, a poor old countryman brought three combs for sale. The Hajee examined them, and was settling the price as breakfast was served up: he left off making the bargain ; but, with that condescending affability for which he is celebrated, desired the peasant to sit down and take his breakfast, which he did at the same fursh (or cloth on which the dishes are placed,) with the minister. ttfDltisTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. ^ court. The younger sons or nephews of a chief seldom receive it till chap. xxv. they are enrolled in the kings guards, or have performed sOme service. This class of men are most tenacious of their descent: and the succession is regulated by attention to the rank and birth of the mother. The son of the khan of a military tribe by a concubine is never placed on a footing with his legitimate offspring: an attempt made by parental fondness to do so, would be resented by the rela tions of his legitimate wives, and would outrage the feelings of his tribe*. The manners of this class, even when softened by long residence at court, always retain a good deal of haughtiness. They are (with some remarkable exceptions,) not so polished and well educated as the civil officers of the court; and much of their time is devoted to martial exercises and field sports. The ministers of state in Persia, and the secretaries of the various departments of government, generally bear the name of meerza. This term, which is a contraction of two words, signifies the son of an ameer, or lord; but at present it does not,when prefixed to a namef, denote high birth. It may be translated civilian, as it * I had an opportunity of observing this custom on many occasions. In 1810, when I visited Mehrab Khan, the chief of a small branch of the Affshar, at his family residence) two of his sons, very richly dressed, were introduced: the eldest was between eight and nine years of age. When we were seated, a fine boy, between twelve and thirteen, in plain clothes, seated himself at a distance, below the other bojs. I asked the khan who he was ? ' He is my son,' said he, « and he is a fine lad ; but his ' mother was only a jeweller's daughter, to whom I was not regularly married. The (&lt; other boys are descended from a high-born mother, and are consequently my heirs.' f The word meerza is derived from meer, or ameer, ' lord/' and za, a contraction of zada, ' soh.' When it follows the name, instead of being prefixed, meerza always denotes a prince of the blood royal.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. implies complete civil habits: all who assume it are understood to have been well brought up, and to devote themselves to those duties that require education They should be able to read and write well, to keep accounts, and be thoroughly versed in all the rules and forms of epistolary correspondence, which are considered by men of rank in Persia to be as essential as the ceremonies that regulate their personal intercourse. Meerzas are in general citizens, though sometimes they belong to warlike tribes. The fact is, every person who has received the slightest education, and who prefers, for any reason, civil occupation to military, becomes a meerza, and is a candidate for the employments usually given to persons of this description. These employments are very numerous; for every officer in the army, every magistrate of a village, has his meerza. This class, who may be said to fill the highest and the lowest offices in the government, are usually distinguished by wearing a kullumddn (or small case which contains pens and ink,) in their girdle; and they seldom, however wealthy, dress with equal splen dour, or assume the same state and equipage, as the chiefs of tribes. Their manners are, from their occupation, mild and polite; and we meet with some of them who are highly polished and accomplished. The Meerzas of Persia are, generally speaking, careful not to offend the rude arrogance of the tribes of that country, by an adoption of their habits. It is unusual for them to follow the sports of the * A meerza may be called a man of business. Some of this class are men of learning, which is certainly not required to qualify them for their occupations.

To relieve them from this degradation, the monarch often raises them to the dignity of khan: but they are looked upon as a mere court nobility; and the lowest chieftain of a clan considers him self superior in real rank to the most favoured meerza. The priesthood of Persia have few distinct usages. Their occu pation enjoins plainness of dress, and forbids the vanity and display to which other persons in this country are so much attached. They are almost all Syuds, an appellation which marks their claim to a descent from the prophet of Arabia. It has been before stated, that the lower ranks of this class are seldom so much entitled to respect as the higher; and the order of priesthood in Persia is degraded by a crowd of persons, who are, or pretend to be, Syuds, assume the name of Hajee, (a term which denotes ' a pilgrim to ' Mecca/') as also that of Moollah, or ' learned manand beg, or rather demand alms, on the ground of their holy character. These persons, who are remarkable for their low cunning and impudence, may be said to live upon the charity of the other classes of the com munity, by whom they are in general feared and despised. In every tale in which roguery is described, we meet with the name of a Moollah, Syud, or Hajee. A Persian writer, who makes some severe remarks upon these holy mendicants, relates*, that a man purchased # Persian MS.574 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xxv. a fine bunch of grapes of a person who sat behind a small window. After he had paid his money, he took hold of the end of the bunch, but, in pulling it through the lattice, every grape fell on the inside, and he held nothing but the bare stalk. ' Oh Syud ! O Moollah! ' O Hajee!' he exclaimed. The man within instantly opened the door, and said, ' You know me then, my friend ?'—' I never saw ' you before,^ said the person to whom he addressed himself; ' but 4&lt; I was quite convinced no one that had not a right to all these ' sacred titles could ever have played me such a trick/' Anecdotes of this character are repeated in every company in Persia : and this circumstance alone proves, that though many of the priesthood are respected on account of their personal merit, they do not, as a body, enjoy that consideration which they possess in some other Mahomedan nations. But the respect which is denied to the order, as a body, is granted to individuals. The estimation in which the principal Moosht^heds, or ' high priests of Persia,' are held, has been before noticed. The most powerful, as well as the weakest of the monarchs of that country, have equally sought to conciliate their good opinion. We read, in the History of Abbas the Great, that a person complained to Moollah Ahmed, the Moos- t&amp;hed of Ardebil, that the king had taken his sister by force into his haram. The holy man immediately gave him a note to the following effect: ' Brother Abbas, restore to the bearer his sister.' The king commanded the woman to be instantly given up; and, showing the note he had received to his courtiers, said aloud, ' Let ' this be put into my shroud : for, on the day of judgment, having ' been called brother by Moollah Ahmed will avail me more than ' all the actions of my life.' The most cruel of the successors ofTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 575 Abbas were only merciful at the solicitation of the chief priests chap.xxv. of their kingdom. Aga Mahomed Khan allowed them to approach him when no others dared to come near; and they sometimes pleaded with success for those whom he had doomed to destruction. The reigning monarch has shown them even greater attention than his predecessor: and as long as they continue to abstain from any concern in political affairs, and to disregard worldly honours and wealth * they will, in all probability, preserve the influence which they have established. There are a number of persons in Persia who pursue their studies till they are entitled to the name of Moollah, and to all the honours of a Persian college, without classing themselves with the priesthood. These follow various occupations. Some devote themselves wholly to study : and to the most eminent of those who follow literary pur- * It has been before stated, that this class avoid intercourse with persons high in station: and they are not forward to cultivate the acquaintance of foreigners ; but this does not always arise from those motives of bigotry to which it is usually imputed. When I was at Shiraz, in 1800, I understood that Shaildi-ul-Islam, or ' chief judge of the court of Sherrah, or written law,' in that city, had weak sight, and wished to have a pair of spectacles. I immediately made him a present of a pair handsomely mounted; but they were returned, with a request that one of less value might be sent. The desire of the chief judge was complied with : and when I some time afterwards met him by accident, he said to me, ' You must have been surprised at my giving you so much trouble about a trifle; and, I fear, you will ' think that I showed an unnecessary affectation of humility in the choice of spec- « tacles: but, in my situation,' he added, ' every trifle has importance; and I must ' not give the slightest grounds for suspicion of my being actuated by those motives of w cupidity that are so common to my countrymen. It is this consideration,' he con tinued, with polite kindness, ' that has prevented my cultivating your acquaintance so ' much as I desired.'THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. suits a very high rank in society is assigned. An author, who has acquired any fame as an historian, an astronomer, or a poet, is respected by all ranks, and has a place of distinction given him in every company in which he mixes. Every prince and noble in Persia desires to be considered a patron of genius; and this feeling secures to men of learning a very fair share in the enjoyments of the community among which they live. They are not only esteemed on account of their real or supposed talents as authors, but as agreeable companions. Their reading furnishes them with anec dotes, which amuse and instruct; and some of them are alike remarkable for the excellence of their composition, and the spright- liness of their conversation. Even the common pretenders among this class, who are very numerous, are in general men of good manners and ready wit. A very slight knowledge of astronomy is sufficient to allow a Persian student to profess the occult science of judicial astro- logy. If a person can take an altitude with an astrolabe, knows the names of the planets, and their different mansions, and of a few technical phrases, and understands the astrological almanacks that are annually published, he deems himself entitled to offer his services to all who wish to consult him; and that includes every person in Persia who has the means to reward his skill. Nothing is done by a man of any consequence, or property, without reference to the stars. If any measure is to be adopted, if a voyage or journey is to be commenced, if a new dress* is to be put on, the lucky or # When at Teheran, in 1800, I was surprised to see the prime minister, Hajee Ibrahim, with whom I lived, consulting a Persian regarding a fortunate moment for putting on a new dress.

A person wishing to commence a journey will not allow a fortunate day to escape, even though he is not ready to set out. He leaves his own house at the propitious moment, and remains, till he can actually proceed, in some incommodious lodging in its vicinity; satisfied that he has, by quitting his home, secured all the benefit which the influence of good stars can afford him. Some years ago*, when a Persian ambassador was about to pro ceed to India, he was informed by his astrologer of a most fortunate conjunction of the stars, which, if missed, was not likely to occur again for some months. He instantly determined, that though he could not embark, as the ship was not ready that was to carry him, to move from his house, in the Town of Abusheher, to his tents, which were pitched at a village five miles off to receive him. It was, however, discovered by the astronomer, that he could neither go out of the door of his own dwelling, nor at the gate of the fort, as an invisible, but baneful constellation-j- was exactly opposite, and shed dangerous influence in that direction. To remedy this, a large aperture was made in the wall of his house; but that only opened into his neighbour's; and four or five more walls were to be cut through before the ambassador and his friends (which ' Malcolm, I am such a fool as to put faith in all this nonsense; but I must not make ' my family unhappy by refusing to comply with forms which some of them deem of ' consequence.' ♦ This occurred in 1806.

They then went to the beach; where it was intended to take a boat, and proceed two miles by sea, in order that their backs might be turned on the dreaded constellation: but the sea was rough, and the party hesitated encountering a real danger in order to avoid an imaginary one. In this dilemma, the governor was solicited to allow a part of the wall of the town to be thrown down, that a mission, on which so much depended, might not be exposed to misfortune. The request, extraordinary as it may appear, was complied with, and the cavalcade marched over the breach to their tents. The astrologer rode near the ambassador, that he might continually remind him of the great importance of keeping his head in one position; and, by his aid, he reached his tents without any occurrence that could tend to disturb the good fortune which was augured to result from his having departed from home at the propitious moment. The ambassador's conduct in this instance, while it satisfied his own mind, met, no doubt, with the highest approbation of the court, and it gave confidence to his attendants*; for, as has been before stated, the natives of * When I visited Teheran in 1800, T found that almost all the Persians in my camp were satisfied that the success or failure of my mission would depend, in no slight degree, upon my entering the capital at a fortunate moment. One of my Persian secretaries, who had consulted an astrologer, rode near me, as I approached the gateway, with a watch in his hand; and as I did not refuse to gratify him, by moving, in a slight degree, quicker or slower as he wished, my horse stept over the threshold of the gateway at the very instant desired. The circumstance gave great joy to all the Persians who were friendly to the mission, as they anticipated more suc cess from ray attention to this trifle, than from all the other efforts I could make.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. Persia, from the highest to the lowest, have faith in this delusive chap.xxv, science. It is, however, to be remarked, that many of those whose occupation is to observe the aspect of the stars, and to calculate nativities, are not the dupes of their own knowledge. Their object is gain j and they make their art subservient to that object. They flatter the ruling passion of those who consult them; and if appa rently compelled to forebode misfortune, it is often with no other view than to point out how it may be averted *. * When on my return from Teheran in 1800, I accidentally fell into company with an astrologer, who insisted upon taking my horoscope, and foretelling my destiny. After the usual forms and calculations, he acquainted me, that on my voyage to India I should meet with a violent storm; and, after escaping it, should be made a prisoner. I observed, that it was fortunate I had no belief in his skill, otherwise I should be un happy, from that moment, in contemplating misfortunes, from which I concluded there was no escape. There I was mistaken, he said: and, to satisfy me of the manner in which misfortune was to be averted, he would relate an anecdote. « Jesus,' said he, ' when sitting at the gate of Jerusalem, beheld a wood-cutter pass out of the city, ' carolling as he went along. ' How ignorant man is of his destiny!' said the son of Mary to his disciples. ' That poor fellow, who appears now so happy, will to day ' P erish in the wood -' When evening came, however, the man returned, singing ' louder than before. The disciples looked at each other, and at their master. Jesus, « reading their thoughts, said, ' O ye of little faith! you doubt my knowledge : but « know, that the man whom you see carried only one small loaf of bread for his dinner; ' and when enfeated by a person in distress to afford him relief, he gave him half his ' loaf. God, pleased with this act, saved his life. But go,' added the prophet, ' and « examine the bundle of wood that he carries, and you will find there the ve?y snake « which was appointed to cause his death.' They went, and saw with wonder the ' Snake ' as Jesus had toId them - You see' said the astrologer, addressing himself to me, « how it is possible to avert the decrees of the stars.' I could not refuse that trifling reward to my companion's ingenuity, which I had been prepared to deny to his pretended skill.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. The poets of Persia are still greater flatterers than the astrologers: but their occupation, for it may be termed one, is less profitable. A few fortunate votaries of the muses enjoy the smiles of fortune: but the great majority of poets in Persia, as in other countries, are poor; and, from their numbers, it is impossible it should be otherwise. Every person who has received a moderate education, may, if he prefers a life of idleness to one of industry, assume the name of a poet; and the merest rhymer receives some additional respect from being called by that honoured appellation. While some favoured poets of Persia are chanting the wonderful deeds of the king, or of the principal chiefs; or composing dewans, or ' collections of odes/' on the mystical subject of divine love; others are contented with writing panegyrics on the virtues, wisdom, bravery, and discernment, of all those who bestow their bounty upon them, or allow them to partake of the good things of their table. They also make epigrams to amuse their patrons; and are alike ready to recite their own verses, or to show their knowledge by quoting the finest passages of the poetry of their country. The facility with which a Persian can obtain a cer tain degree of education at the colleges in the principal cities of the empire, and that indulgence to which the usages of these seminaries invite, produces a swarm of students, who pass their useless lives in indolence and poverty. Isfahan, in particular, abounds with these literary mendicants : and it is chiefly from the scholars educated at its colleges, and those at Shiraz, that the kingdom is inundated with vagrant poets, who lie in wait, not only for the high officers and wealthy men of their native country, but for all strangers whose rank or appearance afford them the slightest prospect of a return for their venal lays. A professed ignorance of their language, or theTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. expression of dislike for their productions, is no defence against their craving importunity, and unconquerable assurance. A poet, who came fifty miles from Shiraz, to welcome me % with a com plimentary ode, beautifully written upon ornamented paper, was told, in order to evade his purpose, that the person he had so praised could hardly comprehend his lines, and had no taste for such compositions. 44 I must tell him a story, then,' said the unabashed poet, 44 which will show him how little necessary the knowledge 44 and taste which he wants, is to the fulfilment of my object.— 44 Some years ago,' said he, 44 when the Affghans had possession of 44 Persia, a rude chief of that nation was Governor of Shiraz. A 44 poet composed a panegyric upon his wisdom, his valour, and his 44 virtues. As he was taking it to the palace, he was met by a friend 44 at the outer gate, who inquired where he was going. He in- 44 formed him of his purpose. His friend asked him, if he was 44 insane, to offer an ode to a barbarian, who hardly understood a 44 word of the Persian language. 4 All that you say may be true,' 44 said he; 4 but I am starving, and have no means of livelihood but 44 making verses. I must therefore proceed/ He went, and stood 44 before the governor with the ode in his hand. 4 Who is that fel- 44 low?' exclaimed the Affghan lord; 4 and what is that paper which 44 he holds ?'— 4 I am a poet/ replied the man ; 4 and the paper con- 44 tains some poetry/— 4 What is the use of poetry?' said the chief. « To render great men, like you, immortal/ he replied, making at 44 the same time a very profound bow. 4 Let us hear some of it. 44 The poet, on this mandate, began to read his composition aloud; * This occurred on my first mission to Persia, in A.D. 1800.582 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap , xxv. ' but he had not finished the second stanza, when he was interrupted. ' 4 Enough T exclaimed the governor. 4 I understand it all. Give ' the poor man some money ; that is what he wants/ The poet re- ' ceived his present, and retired, quite delighted. He met his friend ' at the door, who, the moment he came out, accosted him again. ' 4 You are, no doubt/ he observed, 4 now convinced of the folly of 44 carrying odes to a man who does not understand one word of 44 them/— 4 Not understand !' he replied ; 4 you are quite mistaken. 44 He has, beyond all men I ever met, the quickest apprehension of 44 a poet's meaning/' This story produced, in part, that effect which the travelling poet had expected from his ode: but the notice he received had the common effect of exciting, instead of allaying cupidity; and the witty rhymer made several ingenious, but unsuc cessful efforts, to obtain further liberality. The art of printing is unknown in Persia; and beautiful writing, therefore, is considered a high accomplishment. It is carefully taught in the schools, and those who excel in it are almost classed with literary men. They are employed to copy books; and some have attained to such eminence in this art, that a few lines written by one of these celebrated penmen are often sold for a consi derable sum *. The merchants of Persia are all taught to read and write, and some of them are men of learning. Their better acquaintance with foreign countries, while it renders them free from prejudice, adds greatly to their knowledge: and their manners, though not so # I have known seven pounds given for four lines written by Dervish Musjeed, a celebrated penman, who has been dead some time, and whose beautiful specimens of writing are now scarce.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 583 highly polished as those of the principal nobility and courtiers, are chap.xxv. in general equal, if not superior, to the other classes of the com- munity in which they live. Though the society of merchants of information and education is courted by the first nobles and the highest officers of the Persian government, the former, in general, endeavour to avoid any political connexions: and the observance of this rule is recommended by the almost invariable ruin of all those who are deluded to forsake the path of profit to pursue that of ambition. It is a peculiar usage of the principal merchants in Persia to carry on all their mercantile correspondence in cipher, and every person has a different one. The causes for this extraordinary pre caution are obvious. In a country where there are no regular posts, they are under the necessity of trusting their letters to couriers, whom a small sum would bribe to betray their secrets to commercial rivals, and it is of great consequence to their interests that they should have the first intelligence of political changes, respecting which their correspondent would fear to write in an open man ner. In Persia, the authenticity of a merchant's letters, as well as his bills, depends entirely upon the seal. It is not usual to sign either; and they are not often written in the hand of the person by whom they are sent. It is the seal, therefore, which is of importance: it has alwaj's engraven upon it the name and title, if he has one, of the person to whom it belongs, and the date at which it was cut. The occupation of a seal-cutter is one of much trust and some danger: he keeps a register of every seal he makes ; and if one is stolen or lost by the party to whom he sold it, his life would answer the crime of making another exactly the same. He must affix the real date on which it is cut: and the person to whomTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xxv. the seal belongs, if in business, is obliged to take the most respectable -witnesses of the occurrence, and to write to his correspondents, de claring all accounts and deeds with his former seal null from the day upon which it was lost. Among the lower classes of the citizens of Persia there is not much perceptible difference of manner. That which exists arises from the nature of their respective occupations, and from the partial ditfusion of knowledge. Almost all the tradesmen, and many of the mechanics, have received some education. There are schools* in every town and city of Persia, in which the rudiments of the language of that country, and of Arabia, are taught. The child who attends at one of these seminaries, after he has learnt the alphabet, is made, as a religious duty, to read the Koran, in Arabic; which he usually does without understanding one word of it. He is next taught to read some fables in the Persian language, and to write a legible hand: here his education commonly ends; and unless he is led by inclination to devote himself to study, or his occupation requires that he should practise what he has learnt, the lessons he has received are soon forgotten. But this course of education, slight and super ficial as it may seem, has the effect of changing the habits, and of introducing a degree of refinement among those who benefit by it, which is unknown to their ruder countrymen. # The schools in Persia have been particularly described by Chardin, and other travellers. They are sufficiently reasonable to admit of the poorest tradesman sending his children to them ; but are often under the management of ignorant pedants. It is not to be expected that a government like that of Persia should ever pay attention to the education of its subjects, though that is evidently the root from which all im provement must spring.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. The Persians of all conditions are fond of society. Their table is in general well furnished; as the extraordinary cheapness of provisions of every kind, and the great plenty of fruit, enable even the lowest order of citizens to live well. The hog is the only animal whose flesh they are positively forbidden to eat *. They are also, as Mahomedans, prohibited from tasting wine: but this rule is often broken; and as, to Use their own phrase, ' there ' is equal sin in a glass as in a flaggon/' they usually, when they drink, indulge to excess. They are, indeed, so impressed with the idea that the sole pleasure of this forbidden liquor is centred in its intoxicating effects, that nothing but constant ob servation can satisfy them that Christians are not all drunkards. ' It is,' they often remark, when speaking to a person of that persuasion, ' one of the privileges of your religion to be so, and ' therefore neither attended with shame nor disgrace/' An English officer belonging to a frigate had come on shore at Abusheher, and mounted a high spirited horse to take a ridef. The awkwardness of the rider, who was nearly falling at every bound the animal took, amused a great number of spectators. Next day a Persian, who supplied the vessel with fruit and vegetables, came off, and seeing the officer, said to him, 44 I have saved your reputation; not a man of ' those who laughed at you yesterday has the least suspicion that ' you are a bad horseman/'—' How have you managed that?' said the gentleman he addressed. — ' I told them,' he replied, ' that you, * There are several other meats, such as the hare, &amp;c. which are deemed improper to be eaten. t This occurred when I was at Abusheher, in A. D. 1810. vol. ii. 4 f586 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xxv. ' like every Englishman, rode admirably, as became a nation of ' soldiers, but that you were very drunk, and that alone was the ' reason of your not keeping your seat upon the saddle so firmly as ' you otherwise would have done. v If an endeavour is made to remove these impressions by telling them that, though we are per mitted to use wine, excess is always considered as degrading, and often, when it incapacitates for duty, as criminal, they listeri with a smile of incredulity; for they believe it impossible that men, who are not withheld by motives of a religious nature, can deny themselves what they are led by the restraint imposed upon them to deem one of the most delightful of all enjoyments. The Persians wear hardly atoy under-linen; and among the lower classes the clothes they once put on are seldom taken off till worn out. Nothing Could preserve the health of a people, with such habits, but those ablutions that are enjoined by their religion, and the constant use of the hummums, or hot-baths, which are to be found in every city, town, and village of Persia. Some of these buildings are very splendid; and they are almost always clean, and well supplied with fresh water. A few pieces of the smallest copper coin of the country enables the poorest traveller, or labourer, to indulge in this delightful luxury, which, independent of its salubrity, refreshes the spirits, and dissipates'the effects of the most severe fatigue. Amusements. The nature of the public amusements in Persia has been noticed. The lower classes are entertained by the same exhibitions as the higher. Illuminations, fire-works, wrestlers, jugglers, buffoons, pup pet-shows, musicians, and dancing-boys, amuse all ranks at public feasts: while riding on horseback, visiting, walking in gardens.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 587 and sitting in groupes at their houses, or under the shade of a tree, CHAP. xxy. to listen to a tale or poem, are the usual occupations of their idle hours. Dancing-girls were once numerous in Persia; and the first poets of that country have celebrated the beauty of their persons and the melody of their voices. They continued to form a part of the amusement at every entertainment till the reigning family ascended the throne; but at present they are not allowed at court, and are seldom seen, except in provinces at a distance from the capital* There is no consideration of more consequence, as connected Condition ami with the condition and character of a people, than the laws and ^woTenof customs which regulate the relative situation and intercourse of the Persia • sexes. On it, perhaps, beyond all other causes, depends the moral state of a country, and its progress in general improvement. Many nations, who have allowed their women to be publicly seen, have still remained in a barbarous state f; but there is no instance of the inhabitants of a country in which it was the custom to immure them, and to deny them the benefit of education, ever having at tained a forward rank in civilized life. The influence of women, where they hold their just station in society, is not more calculated to soften the rough manners and to subdue the angry passions of man, than to stimulate him to generous, brave, and noble actions. The admiration of highly cultivated females is more rarely given to personal beauty, than to valour, virtue, and talent; and the • Dancing-girls are still to be met with in Kurdistan, and in parts of Khorassan. t Among the wandering tribes the females are unveiled. The lower classes among the Mahomedans in India do not veil; and the late Captain Grant, who travelled through Mekran in 1809, states, ' that it is not the custom in that country for the ' women to veil.'588 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xxv. hope of obtaining it constitutes one of the purest and highest motives to good and great actions. It has been before stated, that the reli gion of Mahomed sanctions, if it does not inculcate, usages which keep the female sex in a subservient state. The followers of this faith, therefore, may be pronounced to be strangers to this refined but powerful motive of human action. In Persia the lower classes deem females important in proportion as they are useful in domestic duties : the higher consider them as born for their sensual gratifica tion. Women have, in fact, no assigned place in this community, but are what their husbands, or rather lords, may choose to make them. A favourite may, by the power of her mental or personal charms, establish an influence over her domestic tyrant; or she may obtain peculiar respect on account of her superior birth, and the consequent dread which her husband entertains of her relations. Other ties may produce still more remarkable effects: and habit and affection combined may lead a son to continue an attention or obe dience to his mother, that gives her an importance beyond the walls of the haram. But these rare instances, though they sometimes form women of superior knowledge and character, can have no effect in counteracting the evil consequences which their total exclusion from society has upon the manners and morals of men. indulgence in The natives of Persia, like all Mahomedans, consider themselves numberTffe-entitled to an unlimited indulgence in the pleasures of the haram: males ' and though they are restrained, by religious considerations, from marrying more than four wives, they conceive themselves at liberty to increase the number of females in their family to any extent that suited their inclination, or their convenience. The priesthood are expected to be the most moderate in their use of the indulgenceTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. granted by their prophet: and we may judge of their habits, by chap , xxv the remark of a very grave historian *, who, after an animated eulo- gium upon the character of a priest of high reputation, concludes by observing, that ' the continence of this virtuous man was so extra- ' ordinary, that it is affirmed, that during his life he never had inter- ' course with any other females except his four legitimate wives!!' The Persians are entitled, by law and usage, to take females, not Ceremonies within the prohibited degrees of kindred, in three different ways: by of marriage! marriage, by purchase, and by hire. Their marriages are made according to prescribed forms. The female is betrothed-f- by the parents: she may, however, refuse her consent when the priest comes to require it; and the marriage cannot proceed if she con tinues averse to it: but this rarely happens, as the parties never see one another before they are united, and seldom hear any reports of each other but what are favourable. A woman has this, and many other rights, according to the Mahomedan law: but a being, who is first immured by her parents, and afterwards by her husband, and whose name it is almost a crime to pronounce, can practically have little protection from these useless privileges. The nuptial cere mony must take place before two or more witnesses J. The contract * Sherifl-u-deen, author of' The History of Kurdistan.' t Persons, both male and female, are often betrothed in infancy. If this is done by their parents, the marriage must be confirmed when they attain the age of puberty: but if by any other than parents, the most respectable Mahomedan doctors maintain it is null, if either both, or one of the parties desire that it should be cancelled.— Commentary on Mahomedan Law, Vol. I. page 102, 103.

It is then attested and given to the female, who preserves it with great care, for it is also the deed by which she is entitled to her dower*, which is the principal part of her provision in the event of her husband's death, and her sole dependance-f* if she is divorced. Marriages in Persia, as in all eastern countries, are very expensive. It is not unusual for a man to waste the means he has spent his life in acquiring on his nuptial day. They connect their display upon this occasion with their personal reputation, and endeavour to surpass their equals with a ruinous spirit of emulation, * There is no point deemed of more consequence by the Mahomedan law than the dower. The most learned doctors have, however, disagreed widely regarding its inter pretation. A marriage, some hold, is valid, even though there is no dower; but in such cases, as also where an excessive one has been agreed upon, the law may inter pose and settle it upon just and rational principles. The lowest dower that can be legally given is ten dirhems, or between four and five shMxxgs.-—Commentary on Mahomedan Law, Vol. I. page 1£2. t The right of the female to this settlement is guarded, not only by law and usage, but by the protection of her male relations, who are in general the witnesses. It is made payable from the property of the husband; and if he has none, the wife's portion is secured upon whatever he may hereafter possess. The dower is made over to the female, or her assigns, before the consummation of the marriage. It becomes her entire right: and it is not unusual for a mother to give a favourite son her dower; which he can, when vested with her authority, compel his father to pay. The law regarding dower constitutes, as was no doubt intended, a considerable check upon the men of every Mahomedan nation; and it is one of which the women of Persia are very jealous. A woman, according to the Mahomedan law, may exonerate her husband from any part, or even from the whole, of the dower. There are, however, rare instances of the whole being restored, though the wife sometimes gives up a part at the earnest solicitation of the husband, or his friends.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 591 A Persian may purchase as many female slaves as he likes; chap . xxv. and their condition is in no degree altered by the manner in which they live in his family. The sweeper of his house, and the partner of his bed, are alike exposed to be sold again if they have been purchased: but this right is seldom exercised, as it is at variance with that jealous sense of honour which almost all Mahomedans entertain regarding females with whom they have . cohabited. The marriage by contract, and for a limited period, is peculiar Marriage b y to the citizens of Persia. It is said to have been a custom iri contract - Arabia when Mahomed first introduced his religion into that country: but though the prophet tolerated it, Omar abolished it as a species of legal prostitution, that was inconsistent with good morals. The Turks, therefore, and other Soonees who respect the decrees of this caliph, hold this practice in abhorrence. The parties agree to live together for a fixed period, which varies from a few days to ninety-nine years. The sum agreed upon as the lady s hire is mentioned in the contract given to her, which is made out by the cauzee, or a moollah, and regularly witnessed. The man may dissolve the contract when he chooses; but the female has a right, from the hour the deed is signed, to , the whole amount of the sum that was agreed to be paid her. If the parties are willing, the deed is renewed at the period it expires. This contract conveys no rights to the female beyond the sum specified as her hire. She is, under no circumstances, deemed entitled to share in the inheritance of the property of the person to whom she is contracted.

The woman is generally of a very inferior family ; and her condition can only be termed a state of legal concubinage Forms Of di. A man in Persia can divorce his wife at pleasure : but there is an expense and scandal attending such a proceeding, which renders it very unfrequent. It may, indeed, be said never to occur but among the lower classes: for a man of rank would consider him self disgraced by taking a step which would expose a woman, who had been his wife, to be seen by others. The forms of divorce among the Sheahs differ in some trifling points from those observed by the Soonees. Divorces are never on account of adul tery, as that crime, if proved, subjects a woman who has been legally married to capital punishment. The general causes are com plaints of badness of temper, or extravagance, on the part of the husbands; and of neglect, or cruel usage, on that of their wives. If the husband sues for a divorce, he is compelled to pay his wife s dower; but if she sues for it, her claim to that is cancelled. The consequence is, that it is not unfrequent, among the lower orders, when a man desires to be rid of his partner, to use her so ill, that she is forced to institute a suit for separation; and that, if granted, abrogates all her claims upon her busband.

The division of the chief cities into wards, with the names of s ^ v Hjderee and Ne^muttee, which one author f has ascribed to the policy of Shah Abbas the Great, still exists, and continues to excite equal animosity to what it did at former periods. There is at all times a jealousy between these parties; but during the three last days of the Mohurrum they attack each other with violence. The object for which they contend appears to be merely the honour of triumph. If a mosque is decorated by one party, the other, if they can, drive them from it, and destroy the flags or ornaments which have been put up. If they force their opponents from their houses, they do not enter or plunder them, but make a mark on each door with a hatchet, in token of victory. These frays are often very serious, and many lives are lost J ; but no effort is made to abolish an usage which divides those whose union might make them formidable to government. # The Lootee Bazar, or « right of popular insurrection,' which this city claims, has been before noticed. Vide Vol. II. page 6. f Hanway, Vol. II. p. 104. —Hanway terms these opposite parties Peleuk and Feleuk, names now unknown. Langles, in a note in his edition of Chardin, Vol. II. p. 321, concludes that these opposite sects derive their name from Shaik Hyder, the ancestor of the Suffavean family, and from Ne^mutullah, the name assumed by the adherents of the dynasty of the White Sheep, which was destroyed by the sect of Hyderee, or adherents of Ismail Sooffee. X I find it stated in a Persian ms., which gives a particular account of several of these frays, that a species of account current is kept of the men of the different par ties killed. The ward whose inhabitants have slain the greatest number, are fined the price of blood for the balance, whatever number it may be ; and the sum collected is divided among the widows and children of the deceased. vol. ii. 4 g594 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap , xxv: The dress of the citizens of Persia has been often described, both by ancient and modern travellers. That of the men has changed Modern dress &gt; of the Persians very materially within the last century, ihe turban, as a head dress, is now worn by none but the Arabian inhabitants of that country. The Persians wear a long cap covered with lambs' wool, the appearance of which is sometimes improved by being encircled with a Cashmere shawl*. The inhabitants of the principal towns are fond of dressing richly. Their upper garments are either made of chintz, silk, or cloth, and are often trimmed with gold or silver lace: they also wear brocade: and in winter their clothes are lined with furs, of which they import a great variety. It is not cus tomary for any person, except the king, to wear jewels : but nothing can exceed the profusion which he displays of these ornaments; and his subjects seem peculiarly proud of this part of royal magnificence. They assert, that when the monarch is dressed in his most splendid robes, and is seated in the sun, the eye cannot gaze on the dazzling brilliancy of his attire-f*.

They are mostly Georgians or Africans; and being obtained or purchased when young, they are usually brought up in the Mahomedan religion. Their master, who takes the merit of their conversion, appropriates the females to his own haram, or to the service of his wives: and when the males are at a proper age, he marries them to a female slave in the family, or to a free woman. Their children are brought up in the house, and have, as has been before noticed, a rank only below relations. In almost every family of consequence, the person in whom the greatest trust is reposed is a house-born slave; and instances of their betraying their charge, or abusing the confidence that is placed in them, are very rare. The general observations which have been made on the manners Manners and and customs of the Persians, apply peculiarly to the inhabitants of tlTandZg cities, towns, and villages. Many of those of the wandering tribes are tnbes different, and merit a distinct notice. The chiefs of these tribes, during peace, usually reside at court, or at provincial capitals; and leave their followers, whom they occasionally visit, to the direction of the elders of the different branches and families of the tribe. The number which remains in one body is regulated by their means of subsistence. They, in general, change their residence with the season, and may be said, throughout the year, to enjoy a fine climate. They pitch their dark tents on the finest of those plains over which they have a right of pasture; and the encampment is usually on the banks of a rivulet, or a stream. It is commonly formed in a square; and the abode of the principal elder is only to be distinguished from that of the lowest man in the tribe by its size. All are made of the same coarseTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xxv. materials, and in the same shape. The horses, mules, and sheep, are turned loose, to feed around the encampment. While the young men, if not employed in hunting, are generally seen sitting in circles, smoking, or indulging in repose, the women are busily occupied with their domestic duties, or aiding aged men and boys in tending the flocks. It is the usage of these tribes, unless when very strong, to pitch their tents in the vicinity of a range of mountains, that their flocks and families may be within reach of a place of security on the occurrence of danger. Along the base of those hills which divide Kurdistan from Aderbijan and Irak, every valley is occupied, during the spring and summer, by the camps of these wanderers*. Their inatten- The men of some of the rudest of the tribes of Persia are accused gion, t0 ieh by the other natives of that country of paying hardly any attention to the forms of religion, or to its prescriptions, relative to forbidden food; and there is no doubt that the accusation is in some degree just. They openly eat the flesh of the haref, which is classed * Small encampments of gipsies are frequently met with in Persia, particularly in Aderbijan. The habits and occupations of the families which we saw in that country appeared very similar to those of the vagrant tribes who wander over England. The Persians call them Karachee; a Turkish term, which may be translated ' the black ' people and which, probably, has been given to them from their complexion being darker than that of the natives. •f* On my return from Teheran, in A. D. 1800, I one day run a hare near the encampment of some Affsh^r families: a number of young men sprung upon their horses, and joined in the chase. One, who was well mounted, and had a fine dog, rode very hard over some rocky ground, and his dog caught the hare, which he immediately tied to his saddle. I asked him, why he did so ? ' You cannot eat the hare,' I said, « as you know it is mukrooh, or * abominable.' '—' Do you think,' he replied, ' that ' I would have hazarded my life, and half killed ray horse and my dog, to be deterred,THE HISTORY OF PERSLA. by Mahomedan divines among meats which, though not legally prohibited, are deemed abominable; and there is reason to believe, that many of them are not deterred by the Koran from feasting, when they have an opportunity, upon swine's flesh. A Kurd of some respectability, when speaking in private to an English gentle man, observed, that he thought the tribe to which he belonged resembled Europeans more than Mahomedans. He was asked, in what manner? 'Why,' said he, « we eat of hog's flesh, keep no 44 fasts, and say no prayers He had seen, among the few Euro peans whom he had met with, no acts of public worship, and he was unacquainted with that maxim of their faith, which teaches them not to pray in the streets, ct that they may be seen of men f' Though the chiefs of the principal tribes, from being brought up at court, or at the capital of a province, are often as well educated and as polished in their manners as any of the higher classes of the other natives of Persia and though some of their followers, who ac company them amid scenes comparatively civilized, cannot be distin guished from the inhabitants of the cities, whose manners they adopt, and among whom they frequently intermarry and settle; the bulk of the tribe, who remain always in tents, or in their rude villages, continue in a state of the most barbarous ignorance. They circum cise their children when at the proper age, and contract marriages according to the prescribed customs : but they are said, and probably ' after all, by what some fool of a moollah has said, from eating this hare? I would ' eat his father,' he added, laughing; and rode off, delighted with his prize. * I received this characteristic anecdote from Mr. Jukes, to whom the Kurd (who was the commander of a party of his own tribe, that attended the mission as a guard at Kermanshah,) addressed himself. ^ St. Matthew, chap. vi. verse 5.598 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xxv. with truth, to be very neglectful of the other practices of the Maho- Vs '^ v- ^ / medan religion. Though some of them, who desire a character for superior piety, go through the regular ablutions, and the forms of prayer, they are, in general, entirely ignorant of the words which they ought to repeat. A Persian writer, who has related some curious facts on the manners of this class, states*, that, when a young man, he was saying his prayers at the appointed time, before a person of the tribe of Shah Sevund f. Observing that this man did not do the same, he asked him, if he never addressed the Almighty according to the forms prescribed by the holy prophet? ' I now and then bend my head, and raise it again/' was the reply, ' as I have just now seen you do; but I repeat no prayers; and never, ' indeed, learnt any;' The same writer informs us J, that a citizen, who was the guest of a man of one of these tribes, to whom he had been useful in disposing of his sheep, when he began one morning, according to his usual practice, to read aloud a chapter of the Koran, was assailed with a stick by his female hostess, who asked him, in a rage, if he conceived that one of the family was dead, that he thought it necessary to read that book. The husband, though he reproved the violence of his wife, told his friend, that he should have known better than to anticipate misfortune, by going through a ceremony only used at funerals. This rude race seldom receive any religious instruction. If a priest of a neighbouring village visits their tents, and summons them to prayers, they listen to him with impatience; and, if any accident happens to their flocks while they are attending * Persian MS. t This tribe has been before mentioned: (vide Vol. I. page 556). They are stilj numerous. % Persian MS.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 59 g divine worship, they load him with abuse, and reproach him with chap.xxv. being the sole cause of the misfortune*. The wandering tribes of Persia are all plunderers; and they Their boast of glory in admitting that they are so. They are continually recount- ^ r 7 gplunder - ing their own successful acts of depredation, or those of their ances tors : and from the chief to the lowest man in the tribe, they boast openly of deeds for which men would be capitally punished in a better ordered government. Every sentiment that escapes them evinces their attachment to their predatory habits. They often regret the internal tranquillity of their country; and speak, with rapture, of those periods of confusion, when every man who, to use their own expression, ' had a horse, a sword, and a heart, could live in comfort and happiness.' I happened, when on the march towards the royal camp at Sultaneah, to ask a chief of one of these tribes, what ruins those were on the right of the road ? His eyes glistened at the question. ' It is more than twenty years,' he said, •• since 1 accompanied my uncle in a night attack to plunder and ' destroy that village, and it has never been rebuilt. Its inhabitants, ' who are a bad race, and our enemies, have, however, settled near ' it, and are again become rich. I trust in God,' he added with emphasis, ' that the present tranquillity will not last: and if old times ' return, I will have another blow at these gentlemen before I die. v A still more remarkable instance of this feeling occurred on my first mission to Persia. When hunting one day near the line of march, we came to a deep ravine: and as we were crossing it, an old Persian of * This was stated to me by a raoollah, who was in the constant habit of visiting these tribes.600 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xxv. the tribe of Lac, who was then in my service, turned round, and said to me with a smile : ' In this ravine, sir, about twenty years ago, I, and ' ten others of my own tribe, lay in wait for a caravan. We attacked ' them, and killed five or six useless fellows of merchants and mule ' drivers: the rest run away, and we found plenty of plunder. I ' lived gloriously/' he continued, ' for some years on the produce of « the shawls that fell to my share: but all my cash is gone, and I am ' now a poor old fellow. Yet, after all,' he added, ' it is some con- ' solation to think that a man has had a share of the good things of ' this world.' This race are, as may be concluded from the above anecdotes, strangers to the causes which promote civilisation and improvement, and insensible to the blessing of that security and good order which give prosperity to nations. They view every thing through the medium to which they have been accustomed. and power appears only to possess charms in proportion as it ministers to their passions. But this observation may perhaps be applied with equal justice to their superiors. The reigning Mo narch of Persia, when I endeavoured to explain to him the nature and operation of the various checks which constituted the excellence of the British government, exclaimed, after listening with great attention, 44 Your king then appears to be no more than the first magistrate of the state! So limited an authority may have per- ' manence, but can have no enjoyment! My power,' he added, ' is very different: it is real enjoyment! I can either elevate or ' degrade all these high nobles and officers whom you see around ' me at pleasure: but then, it is true, there is no security for ' my family possessing the throne I occupy. Right, in Persia, ' always has and always will belong to the sword.' It is not \liTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. surprising that the military populace of a country, where the monarch professes these sentiments, should measure their title to consideration, and their power of attaining enjoyments, by their means of pillaging or oppressing others. If a prince, or chief of high rank, evince a contrary disposition, his conduct excites, among this class, very opposite feelings to those of admiration. A man of one of these tribes, who was sent to accompany two English gentlemen * through a part of Persia, contended with his compa nions, that a prince of the blood royal whom he served had better claims to the crown, because he was more dreaded than one of his royal brothers whom they had extolled for his humanity, virtue, and intelligence. « You see,' he observed to them as they were riding along, « that small village before us. If the prince you praise were ' where we are, the inhabitants would be at this moment running to ' meet him, and be eager to pitch his tents : whereas, if my master were here, so great is the terror of his name, that they would ' alread J have fled to the summit of the neighbouring hills. Now, I ' ask you,' he added, exultingly, « which is the most proper of these « two to govern such a kingdom as Persia?' The same person, who was rather an intelligent man of his class, was very inquisitive to learn from his fellow travellers the condition of England: and, after listening with delight to their accounts of the richness of its fields, the beauty of its towns, and the great wealth of its inhabitants, he exclaimed, ' What a number of plunderers you must have there f!' * This occurred in A. D. 1810. Mr. Ellis and Captain Macdonald were the gentle men alluded to. They were travelling from Sennah in Kurdistan to Hamadan in Irak. t When I returned from Persia in 1801, I brought with me a man of some rank belonging to a tribe in Khorassan, who desired to visit India. I was anxious that he vol. ii. 4 h602 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xxv. On being informed that the laws restrained men from plundering, he asked, with apparent astonishment, ' What then can be the ' occupation of so numerous a population Those who had given the description which led to these remarks, were at once amused and surprised at so extraordinary a proof of that strong bias which the human mind receives from its feelings and thoughts being all directed in one course. Their abhor- Though the highest of the military tribes of Persia are proud of rence of the r ii • name of being called plunderers, they hold in abhorrence the name or thieves. The cause of this distinction is obvious. The difference between force and fraud, implies that between strength and weakness. There are, however, some of the lesser clans whose occupation is avowedly theft; but even these pretend to honour. When the British mission passed through Kurdistan, the camp was one day pitched in the vicinity of the huts of some families of the tribe of Ghishkee. The women were employed in baking, spinning, and weaving carpets; while the men were, as usual, wandering idle, or in search of game. The English gentlemen, who had been told that this tribe were remarkable for being the greatest thieves in Persia, and that the children were beat daily by their mothers to accustom them to pain, that when they were caught stealing they might not be alarmed, by blows, into a confession of their accomplices, asked an old man if these accusations were true. 'We are abused/' he said, ' more ' than we deserve; for, after all, our theft is only a species of war. ' We never either rob or steal, except from those with whom our should see and admire Calcutta, and sent a person to show him every part of that city. When he returned, I asked him what he thought of the capital of British India? ' Ajub jaee buraee chapou ast!' was his reply.

' confusion,' he added, ' then is our harvest: but now these Ku- « jurs,' meaning the reigning family, ' have every thing their own ' way, and we are likely to be ruined/'—On hearing some suspicion expressed as to the truth of his statement, the old man observed, with animation, ' that his tribe had been appointed to guard the « English camp, and that we should have an opportunity of judging « of their honesty, when trust was reposed in them, by the manner ' in which they performed that duty/' He had a right to boast that they were faithful guards, for not an article was lost during the period they attended the mission. The inhabitants of Persia have always been famed for their great Their hospi- hospitality to strangers; but the chiefs of the warlike tribes of that country are, beyond all others, remarkable for the manner in which st ™ ageTS ' they perform this courteous duty. The conduct of the Khan of the tribe of Karagoozoloo to the British mission which some years ao-o visited his government at Hamadan* may be adduced as a proof of this fact. He had prepared, for their accommodation, his own house in the town, and removed to a country-seat, which was at some distance. To this residence he one day invited the whole party; and, at his particular desire, every person, from the highest to the lowest, went. The train of the English envoy was increased by that of a Persian ambassador and his suite, who were proceeding to India. The cavalcade reached the khan's abode at an early hour, * I left Teheran in January, 1801, and arrived at Hamadan, on my way to Bagdad, on the eleventh of February. The cold was, at this period, excessive, and the whole country was covered with snow, about four feet deep. The name of the Governor of Hamadan was Mahomed Hussun Khan Karagoozoloo.604 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xxv. and staid till near midnight. Nothing could exceed the magnifi- cence of their entertainment. They were not, however, aware, till they had taken their leave, of the extent of the attention with which they had been treated. When they mounted to return home, they were informed, that during the time they had been at dinner a sudden and severe frost having come on, every horse and mule belonging to the party, amounting to nearly two hundred, had been rough shod, to prevent any accident occurring to the guests of the khan. All were alike struck with admiration at this re markable proof of the kind and munificent hospitality of their noble host. Boast tiiat The tribes of Persia, as well as those of Arabia, boast, that when invioiabTe d 13 once P led g e themselves to give protection, their word is invio lable : but the faithless barbarity of a chief* of the tribe of Fylee has injured, if not destroyed, the claim, which even the worst of these plunderers had before established, to the confidence of the defence less stranger. This villain invited two English officers -f, who were travelling near his camp, to be his guests, and he became their mur derer. His crime appeared to excite, at the moment, a very general feeling of indignation; but, to the reproach of the government, and of his countrymen, he has hitherto escaped punishment, and con tinues to commit depredations amid the mountains that separate the Persian province of Khuzistan from the territories of the Turkish ruler of the Pachalic of Bagdad. * Kulb Aly Khan. f Captain Grant and Lieutenant Fotheringham. The indignation which all felt at the conduct of this chief, was greatly increased by the high character of those who became the victims of his treacherous barbarity.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. ^ The attachment of the tribes of Persia to the families of their chap.xxv chiefs has been noticed. They will seldom consent to obey any other person : and instances often occur, where an infant is carried into the metTt field, in order that the services of those who consider him as their Sthieff only lawful leader may be obtained. If a general levy of the tribe be required for the service of the sovereign, it is effected with difficulty and delay: but a call, connected with their own safety, or that of their chieftain, is promptly obeyed. On such occasions, the signal to assemble flies, to use their own phrase, ' from tent to tent, from ' hill to hill.' We are struck at meeting, among these rude fami lies, so many usages with which we are familiar; and the interest we take in inquiring into their customs is increased by the recol lection that they were those of our forefathers. The wandering tribes of Persia maintain a constant inter- Their com- course with the principal cities and towns of that country. They raerce ' generally carry on a petty commerce in horses and sheep, which they breed; and in carpets, which are wove by their females. In return for these, they receive grain, cloth, money, and articles of hardware. The unwarlike part of the population of Persia are termed Taujeck, which word has been before explained*. It means a person of civil occupation. But this class are not con fined to cities. They are often attached to the wandering tribes, by whom they are employed to cultivate their fields, and to tend their flocks. The tribes of Persia have not, however, at present, many subjects of this description. They decrease as the government advances in vigour, and can release them from a dependance upon * Vide Vol. i. p. 125.*r 606 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. D chap .xxv. their rude masters. It is remarkable, that all the Taujecks in Affghanistan, and part of Tartary, speak the Persian language: and this fact, while it aids us in fixing the ancient limits of that empire, appears to support a conjecture before made*, that though these countries have been overrun, at different periods, by martial tribes, those races of their inhabitants who pursued the occupations of civil life, have remained unchanged, amid the revolutions to which the countries they inhabit have been exposed. The ceremonies practised by the wandering tribes, on the circum cision of their male children, on giving a name to a child, or in the burial of the dead, are substantially the same as those of the citizens of Persia, and of all other Mahomedans; but they continue to preserve, at the funerals of chiefs and soldiers of high reputation, the usages of their more remote ancestors. The charger of the departed warrior, carrying his arms and clothes -f*, accompanies the proces sion ; and it is not unusual for those who desire to show their respect for the deceased, to send a horse without a rider, but with arms upon his saddle, to swell the train of the mourning cavalcade J. Every trace of these rude rites is interesting, as it marks the origin of customs that are still observed by the most civilized nations.

J I find from the MS, of Meer Yusoof-u-deen, that the same usages prevail in Tartary.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. towns of that kingdom. Like them they settle a dower upon their wives. The ring is sent in all due form, and presents are inter changed between the families. They also observe the usage of stain ing the hands with a red dye * the day before that of the marriage; and, like the citizens, they dissipate their property on their nuptial feasts. These feasts, among men of rank or wealth, are protracted to thirty or forty days; and with the poorest person they continue three. That period is indeed requisite for the observance of the established forms. On the first day the company are assembled ; the second is appropriated to the important ceremony of staining the hands; and the third to that of the marriage. Among all ranks in Persia the bridegroom appears, on his wedding-day, dressed in all the finery he can obtain; and on that day he receives from his relations and friends the same obsequious attention which is paid by inferiors to a superior of elevated rank. All who come into his presence sit below him f; offerings are brought to the bridegroom from his rela tions ; and these are received with great ceremony by some of his friends, who act on that day as his servants. Two persons, generally near relations, are appointed to carry his orders into execution: these are termed his right-hand man and left-hand man j : and if the bridegroom is a child, or bashful, these men act for him, and increase the mirth of the wedding by a thousand tricks Which they play on his relations and friends. They pretend to receive the bridegroom's * This dye is called hennah. t If the governor of a province were to attend the isarriage ceremony of his ser. vant, he would, on that occasion, sit below him. — Persian MS, i The bridegroom's right-hand man is, in Turkish, called sdkdesh; and his left-hand man soldesh.608 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xxv. commands as those of a monarch, to seize one person, to fine another, and to flog a third. These marriage pranks are usually preconcerted: but even when not, they never give offence, as in stances of bad humour at a nuptial festival are of very rare occur rence. The joys in the house of the bride are more moderate: the lady is bathed, perfumed, and dressed in the richest clothes her family can afford. She also sits in state; and, before she leaves her own house, or tent, she receives presents from a number of her friends. When this ceremony is over, she is covered with a scarlet veil, is mounted upon horseback, and conveyed to her husband's dwelling, who receives her at the threshold. The above usages are now almost as common among the citizens as among the wandering tribes of Persia. It remains to speak of those customs which are more peculiar to the latter; and several of which, from their character, probably existed among this class long before the intro duction of the Mahomedan religion. On the morning that the bride is to be conveyed to the house or tent of the bridegroom her friends assemble. If she is the daughter of a chief, or of an elder of a tribe, she is accompanied by all the horsemen whose attendance he can command: the party proceed, accompanied by dancers and music; and, if the place of their destina tion is near, they take a circuitous road to it, that the enjoyment of this part of the ceremony may be prolonged. When they appear at a distance the bridegroom mounts his horse, and, attended by his friends, proceeds to meet the cavalcade. He holds an apple or an orange^ in his hand, and, when sufficiently near to be certain of his * This usage, of throwing the apple or orange, is also common among citizens, who throw it at their brides from the threshold or balcony of the house.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. aim, he throws it at her with considerable force All is silent atten tion from the time the parties come near each other till this act, which is the signal for general uproar and confusion. The bride groom wheels his horse round, and rides at full speed to his place of abode. Every horseman of the bride's party endeavours to seize him; and he that succeeds, has his horse, saddle, and clothes, as a reward. This, however, is only the case where the party is wealthy: among the poorer classes a few pieces of silver are paid as a fine to the suc cessful pursuer. The bridegroom, however, is not often taken ; for, as it is a point of honour to escape, he rides the fleetest horse of his tribe, and his friends endeavour by every means to favour his retreat. When the bride arrives at her future residence, the women by whom she is attended entreat her not to alight. The husband's rela tions crowd around her, and beg that she will. This is the moment of her power: every male of the family into which she is about to enter brings her presents proportionate to their ability, or their feel ings of regard to her husband. They also solicit her to give up part of her dower, and their instances are afterwards repeated by the husband : but the women of Persia are naturally tenacious of the only security they have against bad usage or accident; and, though they sometimes return a part, they usually reserve enough to render it a check upon those to whom they intrust their future comfort and happiness. At these marriages the men and women of the tribe dance-f: and the most polished chiefs, though they may conform, in * He is encouraged to throw the apple away with all the force he can, as it is deemed fortunate to do so. t They stand in a line or ring and join hands, while the music plays, and a person sings in just cadence with it.

The virtue of the females is more strict: they are, from their labour, more valuable to their husbands: and the poorer class have seldom the means of paying a dower to a wife whom they divorce. We may also conclude, that it is dangerous, in such a community, to offend the relations of a female of a respectable family: for, though these are prompt to be her executioners if she is proved guilty of adultery, they are her strenuous supporters as long as she is innocent of that crime. We are told by an intelligent Persian*, who has written a short treatise upon the manners of these tribes, that the deepest pledge which they can give of their resolution to conquer or perish in any enterprise in which they are engaged, is to go through the ceremony of a conditional divorce of their wives. They pronounce them divorced unless success crowns their efforts. ' In former days/' he observes, ' a man would have been deemed despicable who outlived defeat ' after this ceremony: but it is now,' he adds, ' too often an empty ' boast; and men are not ashamed to fly the moment after they ' have uttered a vow which their ancestors deemed the most sacred ' that a man of honour could make. J, * Persian MS.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. The time of the male part of the tribes in Persia is passed in riding, practising their military exercises, and hunting. Their fare is coarse and moderate: they now and then feast upon meat; but their general diet is a hard black bread, sour milk, and curds. They do not often indulge in intoxicating liquors: their chief delight is in sitting together, smoking their pipes, and in listening to songs and tales, or in looking at the tricks, grimaces, and witticisms, of buffoons*, (who are to be found in every quarter of Persia;) and some of whom are perfectly skilled in their art. A Persian chieff of a Kurdish tribe who remained several days with the British mission when it was in the vicinity of Kermanshah, had in his train a jester, who possessed very versatile and extraor dinary talents. One day upon the march, this fellow, addressing the English envoy, said, « You are, no doubt, very proud of the ' discipline you have established among your Persian servants, who ' march in your front in as regular a style as your own soldiers. ' How long, sir,' said the wit, ' has it taken you to introduce this ' order among my countrymen?'—' About six months,' was the reply. — ' Now,' said he, 44 if you will permit me, you shall see * The Persians say, that a good Loottee, or « buffoon,' ought to be able to laugh, cry, weep, sit still, and dance, at the same moment. Some of these jesters approach very near this idea of perfection. t This occurred in 1801. The name of this chief was Mehdy Khan Kulhoor: he is chief of a tribe who can mount four thousand horse. This nobleman possessed more accomplishments than any I met with in Persia. He was not only a scholar, but a poet and a painter; and he added to his other qualities the reputation of being a good soldier.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xxv. ' that I will, in less than six minutes, destroy all that you have done « in six months.' On leave being granted, he immediately rode near the Persian horsemen, who were leading the state-horses, and who had strict orders not to leave their ranks. He had noticed that these men were almost all of the Lac and Fylee tribes, whose chief residence is among the mountains of Louristan : and he began to sing, as if to himself, but in a clear and loud voice, a song, which commenced, ' Attend to me ye sons of Louristan, I sing of the ^ glorious deeds of your forefathers/' Before he had finished his song, to which all were listening with attention, the whole cavalcade was thrown into confusion by the kicking of horses, caused by the Persians having broke the line of march and crowded round to hear him more distinctly. The jester laughed most heartily at the success of his joke; and, addressing the envoy, said: ' Do not be distressed ' at the fate of your fine discipline, for I have heard of a man who, ' with no other means than the song I have just sung, collected an ' army, and was called a king* for several weeks/' The men of the wandering tribes delight to tell or listen to romantic tales : some of them not only make themselves masters of this art, but learn to recite verses, particularly those of Ferdosi. A person who has cultivated this talent enjoys a great share of the respect of his associates, who frequently call upon him to amuse an * This, I am assured, was the fact. A chief of no pretensions had, during the con fusion that followed the death of Niidir Shah, gone about Louristan with some musicians and singers, who continually plaj'ed and sung this favourite provincial air; and he had actually, by this ; means alone, collected about five thousand followers, and proclaimed himself king.xxv.

It has been already stated, that the women of the tribes of Persia Condition of who dwell in tents are seldom veiled : their usual occupations have the wandering also been described. They are more respected than the females who ribeS ' dwell in cities, because they are more useful to the community of which they form a part. They not only share the bed, but the fatigues and dangers of their husbands : and the masculine habits which they acquire do not displease, for they seem suited to their condition of life. If they are not of high rank, they perform all the domestic and menial offices of their own home: and strangers, who visit their houses and tents, are certain to receive the kindest and most hospitable welcome from them. But there is nothing in the manner of these women that can be mistaken : it is fearless, but not forward; and evidently proceeds from the consciousness of security, not the absence of shame. Though in general their com plexion is dark and sun-burnt, they have sometimes, when young, a considerable share of beauty : a sense of their free condition gives lustre to their eyes; and they often add to fine features a very graceful form. But among the lower orders of this class, their beauty is soon destroyed by hard labour, and continual exposure to the climate. A Persian gentleman remarkable for his polished manners and the gayety of his disposition, describes his entertainment by the * Mahomed Hussein Khan, son of the late Mehdi Aly Khan, who was sent by the Government of Bombay on a mission to the Court of Persia in A.

' When I arrivedhe observes, ' at the village of ' Sennah which is inhabited by the Turkish tribes of Khuzal and ' Affshdr, I was invited to take up my abode in the house of one of ' the chiefs of the latter, and received, while I staid, the greatest ' attention from all his family. The ladies, who, according to ' custom, were unveiled, were particularly kind. The daughter of my ' host, who was about fifteen years of age, was more beautiful than ' I can express.

Affsh^r families, I expressed my doubts to a Persian noble, who was with me, regarding their reputed boldness and hardihood, and particularly of their skill in horsemanship. He immediately called to a young woman of a handsome appearance, and asked her in Turkish if she was not a soldier's daughter? She said she was. ' And you expect to be a mother of soldiers/' was the next observation. She smiled. ' Mount that horse,' said he, point ing to one with a bridle, but without a saddle, ' and show this ' European envoy the difference between a girl of a tribe, and a ' citizen's daughter.' She instantly sprung upon the animal, and, setting off at full speed, did not stop till she had reached the summit of a small hill in the vicinity, which was covered with loose stones: when there, she waved her hand over her head, and then came down the hill at the same rate she had ascended. No thing could be more dangerous than the ground over which she galloped: but she appeared quite fearless, and seemed delighted at having had an opportunity of vindicating the females of her tribe from the reproach of being like the ladies of cities. The poverty and usages of the wandering tribes often prevent the men from marrying even the number of wives allowed by the law. Many of them have only one; and, unless she is old, barren, or unfit to work, they do not marry another. The reason is, that they can seldom afford to support more than one wife: and, from the liberty which the females enjoy, their quarrels, where there are several in a family, would be seriously embarrassing; and marriage, which is con sidered as one of the chief bonds of union between the men of a tribe, would become a constant source of discord and contention. The practice of hiring wives for a certain period, which prevails inTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xxv. the cities and towns of Persia, is held in abhorrence by the females of tribes; and these have frequently been known to attack The practice # i i_ v j i of hiring wives priests in the most violent manner, whom tney believeu to have horrelce' ' ' sanctioned an usage which they deem so degrading. Though we among them. conclude, from what has been stated, that these women enjoy more freedom and consideration than the other females of Persia, they are still remote from that rank which has been assigned to the sex among the civilized nations of Europe: they toil, while their lord-like husband spends his hours in indolence, or amusement, and are regarded more as servants than as associates. If a man of a wandering tribe has not so many wives and slaves as the religion he professes permits, or as his brother Mahomedan of the city, it is merely, as has been stated, because his poverty, or the condition of the society to which he belongs, limits his desires. The moment that his situation alters he is prompt to riot in every species of dissipation; and the partner, who more than shares his toils, has no chance of an equal partition in any good fortune that may attend him. If he is raised to a high station, he deems an increased indulgence of his sensual appetites one of the chief pleasures of advancement: and when he becomes an inhabitant of a city, he at once adopts the customs of a citizen. His first wives, if he has more than one, are compelled to sacrifice the liberty they before enjoyed, and to endure that neglect which is the natural consequence of his power to obtain younger and Their respect more beautiful females. Among these tribes, however, maternal ~ a claims are always respected. The mother's influence over her son usually continues through life; and she is ready to maintain that authority, which is grounded on habit and affection, by ministering to his gratification. It is her duty to preside over his family; and, ifTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 017 he is rich, he usually intrusts to her not only the choice of his female chap .xxv partners, but their management. An anticipation of the enjoyment of this power makes the women in Persia anxiously desire to have male children. The birth of a son is hailed with joy; that of a daughter is always a disappointment. These observations on the usages of the wandering tribes chiefly Co„di.i„„ „ f apply to those of Persian and Turkish origin. The Arabian tribes .'pt' subject to Persia, who inhabit the shores of the Gulf, are more sia ' assimilated, in their habits, to the people from which they are derived, than to those amid whom they dwell. They continue to speak Arabic, and preserve almost all the customs of their original country. They in general dress like the inhabitants of Arabia, Their dress, wearing, instead of the cap of the Persians, a light turban, and are usually covered with a flowing cloak. The manners of this race, though less rude than those of the other tribes of Persia, retain much of the wildness and independence of their ancestors. The diet of the Arabian tribes in Persia is more frugal than that Diet, of any other of the inhabitants of that kingdom. It consists chiefly of dates. But what others would consider a hardship, habit, with them, has converted into an enjoyment; and the Arab deems no food more delightful than that upon which he lives. Some years ago, a woman, belonging to one of the Arab families settled at Abusheher, had gone to England with the children of the British resident at that place. When she returned, all crowded around her, to hear the report of the country she had visited. She described the roads, the car riages, the horses, the wealth and the splendour of the cities, and the highly cultivated state of the country. Her audience were full of envy at the condition of Englishmen, and were on the point of VOL. 11. 4 K618 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap . xxv. retiring with that impression, when the woman happened to add, that the country she had visited only wanted one thing to make it delightful. ' What is that?' was the general inquiry. ' It has 44 not a date tree in it' said she. ' I never ceased to look for « one, all the time I was there, but I looked in vain.' The sen timents of the Arabs who had listened to her, were, in an instant, changed by this information. It was no longer envy, but pity^ which they felt for men, who were condemned to live in a country where there were no date trees. The Arabian tribes in Persia possess the power of flying from oppression when they cannot resist it. The sea is always open to them, and they are accustomed to that element. Not only the islands of the Gulf, but the neighbouring territories of Turkey, and the opposite coast of Arabia, are inhabited by their brethren : and these circumstances, combined with their original habits, give a freedom of sentiment and expression to this race of men that is very striking. When a party of English gentlemen, who were hunting near Abusheher, were preparing to slip an English and an Arabian greyhound at a deer, to see which was fleetest, one of them stated his belief that the English dog would beat. The moment this obser vation was made, a poor Arab, who had accompanied the party in hopes of obtaining a trifling present for leading a dog, sprung forward, and exclaimed, with all the natural energy of his race, ' You are wrong, sir! by Heaven, the Arab dog will win*!' The manners of some of the mountain tribes who inhabit the great ranges of the southern part of Persia, cannot be described, * This occurred when I was at Abusheher in 1810.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. for thej are hardly known : but we may conclude, that their usages are as little changed since the time of Alexander, as their relations to the sovereign of the country; which, from the description given of them by the historians of the Grecian conqueror, appear to have been exactly the same at that period as they are at present. Alex ander is represented as having pursued the same policy toward them which the modern Kings of Persia are necessitated to adopt. He endeavoured to make them husbandmen and feeders of cattle, that they might, ' when they had property of their own to defend, re- ' frain from encroaching upon their neighbours The rude tribes, who have been described, are not envious of that civilisation of which we are so proud. We may wonder at their ignorance and prejudice ; but we must recollect that men are formed by habit, and that all their sufferings and enjoyments are comparative. How often do we see them rejoicing under hard ships and bondage, and repining at their lot when courted by liberty and fortune! The feelings we receive from living in one state of society, disqualify us from judging of those of another : but he who has travelled over the greatest space will be most struck with the equal dispensation of happiness and misery ; and his value for knowledge will not be decreased by observing, that those are not always the most happy who possess it. It is proper and just that we should be grateful for the blessing of civilisation; but we should not assume too great a superiority over those who con tinue in a more barbarous state.

Human nature is always the same, in whatever garb it is clothed : and there can be none to whom it is of more consequence to contemplate society in its rudest state, than a nation who continues, amid scenes of luxury and refinement, to cherish an individual independ ence, and a political freedom, that are grounded upon the institu tions of a race of brave, but turbulent warriors; and which cannot be maintained but by the constant recollection of those rights which belong to him, who is ready to suffer every priva tion, rather than become a slave.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 021 CHAPTER XXVI. Reflections on the actual Condition of Persia, and the Character of its Inhabitants. Though no country has undergone, during the last twenty een- chap.xxvi turies, more revolutions than the kingdom of Persia, there is, perhaps, none that is less altered in its condition. The power of the sovereigns, and of the satraps of ancient times; the gorgeous magni ficence of the court; the habits of the people; their division into citizens, martial tribes, and savage mountaineers; the internal admi* mstration; and mode of warfare; have continued essentially the same : and the Persians, as far as we have the means of judging, are, at the present period, not a very different people from what they were in the time of Darius, and of Nousheerwan. There is no example, during more than twelve centuries, of any Mahomedan nation having attained a high rank in the scale of civilisation. The inhabitants of all those countries who have adopted this religion, have invariably been exposed to the miseries of an arbitrary and unsettled rule. Many reasons have been urged to account for this remarkable and striking fact; among which the most prominent are the example of the prophet of Arabia, and the character of some of the fundamental tenets of his faith. The life of Mahomed, after he declared his mission, was passed622 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap .xxvi in constant warfare; and he is scarcely more revered by his fol- lowers on account of his sanctity as ' the deputed of God*/' than for his personal courage, and his skill as a military commander. Every Mahomedan ruler has, consequently, been able to plead, pt coodi as a lawful excuse for his ambition, the desire of emulating the earthly glory of his prophet: and the precepts of the Koran f, ifovement have continually been quoted to show, in their application to the friends and enemies of the faith, the necessity of obedience, and the Weieasoi virtue of violence. plete apathy The institution of polygamy, and the degrading usage of secluding wl under the female sex, which Mahomed practised and recommended, have, population c no doubt, had an influence, scarcely secondary to any other cause, in tribesiareci retarding the progress of civilisation among those races who have be, from til adopted his faith. The mind is formed by its domestic habits: and irathertlii in a Mahomedan community, every man is a despot in his own fee has ne house. From childhood to old age he hears of, and sees nothing but, effort made f arbitrary power.

Other causes might, no doubt, be discovered in the ancient and present condition of the great kingdoms of Asia, which may, in some degree, account for their never having attained a state of improvement which can be compared with that enjoyed by almost all those nations who form the present commonwealth of Europe; but the reasons that have been stated, will fully explain that com plete apathy on all points connected with the shape of the govern ment under which they live, which is a characteristic feature of the population of every country inhabited by Mahomedans. Chiefs of tribes have combined to preserve their independence. Their followers have, from their love of natural liberty, clung to the habits of savage life rather than become the defenceless objects of oppression: but there has never been, among those who professed this religion, one effort made for rational freedom, nor a desire shown to impose any salutary and permanent check upon the absolute authority of their sovereign. If his cruelty occasions revolt, the only use which they make of success is to place themselves at the mercy of another tyrant; and his first exercise of that power which they bestow upon him, is to subdue the spirit of turbulence to which he has owed his elevation. The History of Persia, from the Arabian conquest to the present day, may be adduced as a proof of the truth of these observations : and while the causes, by which the effects have been produced, con tinue to operate, no material change in the condition of that empire can be expected. Its prosperity will continue to depend upon the personal character of its monarchs: and the best of kings cannot do624 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap .xxvi more than promote that during the uncertain period of his own life. The consequences which the recent approximation of a great European power ^ may have upon the future destiny of this kingdom, cannot easily be foretold: but the natives of Turkey, wrapt up in the habits of their ancestors, and defended by their religious prejudices, have for ages resisted the progress of that civilisation with which they are surrounded: and if we were to draw an inference from this example, we should conclude, that vicinity of territory, and consequent collision of opposite habits and faith, was more likely to increase than to dimi nish those obstacles which have hitherto prevented any very intimate or social intercourse between Mahomedan and Christian nations. Before we conclude a work in which an effort has been made to convey to the English reader fuller information than he has hitherto possessed of the past history and present condition of Persia, it appears desirable to offer some reflections on the general character of the different classes of its inhabitants. General clia- The personal characters of the Kings of Persia have been given racterandcon- . /• i • i • i • i *11 dition of the m the course or this history: what remains to be said relates more to Pereil' 8 ' 3 0f those qualities which appear to be connected with their condition, than to their personal disposition or talents. Almost all the sove reigns of this country have been religious, or were at least punctual observers of the forms of the faith which they professed, This is essential (even if they were not sincere,) to the support of their power; and its necessity is inculcated from infancy. Lessons of morality are not thought to be so important. Every Monarch of Persia is considered at liberty to indulge, from his earliest youth. f Russia.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. 625 mthe grossest sensuality. The boundless gratification of his pas- chap xxvi sions is deemed a privilege of his condition: and we may, perhaps, trace to this, beyond all other causes, that constant change of dynasties which we meet with in the history of this country. Families are elevated to power by the efforts of some great and extraordinary man : his immediate successors, stimulated by his example, and by the necessity of exertion, to maintain and extend the dominion that his courage and talents have acquired, pursue the same path; but their descendants are destroyed by the fame of their forefathers. Instructed to believe themselves born to rule, they conceive that they have only to enjoy the power which they inherit. They give themselves up to the luxury by which they are courted ; listen to the flatterers by whom they are surrounded; till, enervated and subdued by a life of indolence and vice, they fall before a popular chief of their own country, or a foreign enemy. A Monarch of Persia acknowledges nothing as obligatory upon him but the ritual observances of his religion. Mercy, generosity, and justice, he admits to be virtues; but considers them as royal qualities, not duties. Accustomed to have every look obeyed, and to complete submission to his authority, he is as impatient of any obstacle to the fulfilment of his desires, as he is insensible to the value of devoted service. We discover, from their history, that the Kings of Persia have, with some remarkable exceptions, almost always chosen their personal companions from among men of low birth and mean attainments. Those who exercise absolute power, and whose only title to be called great is derived from the splen-' dour of the station which they occupy, hate to be approached in their unreserved moments by men who have high pretensions, either vr»t tt626 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap , xxvi from hereditary rank, or superior talents and virtue. They feel happier and more at ease when surrounded by a circle of an op posite description : and the pride of despotism is, perhaps, never so much gratified as when it can look around and see nothing but what rests entirely on its favour, and which consequently can be destroyed with the same breath by which it was created. There is, perhaps, nothing more difficult than for a Monarch of Persia to continue humane, even if that should be his natural dis position. The constant habit of directing and witnessing executions must, in the course of time, harden his nature: and those intrusted with the education of the princes of this country, as if apprehensive that an indulgence in tender feelings should interfere with the per formance of their future duties, take them, when almost infants, to witness scenes at which men would shudder^ These early lessons appear to have been almost uniformly successful; for we have hardly one instance, in the history of Persia, of a king of that country evincing any uncommon degree of humanity : while there are many to prove, that the habit of shedding blood often becomes a passion; by a brutal indulgence in which, human beings appear to lose that rank and character which belong to their species. The Sovereigns of Persia are sometimes compelled to devise the means of secretly destroying those powerful subjects whose allegiance they suspect, but whom they fear openly to accuse or to attack. Policy, and indeed self-preservation, may justify such proceedings ; but the necessity of having recourse to them cannot prevent their baneful influence on the mind, nor alter that impression which they are calculated to make. Cruelty never excites more indignation than when combined with art; and the undisguised violence of tyran-THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. nical power appears like virtue when compared with the treacherous chap .xxvi acts of its timid weakness. The observations which have been made upon the Kings of Persia apply to all despots who have similar power: but there are, fortunately for mankind, few nations where the authority vested in the chief ruler is so absolute. We cannot be surprised, when we consider their condition, that the monarchs of that kingdom have, in general, been careless of the rights of others, but tenacious of their own; that they have recognised no limit to their oppression but apprehension of revolt; that they have only measured their indul gence in pleasure by their power of enjoying it; that they have sought to amass treasure by every means that did not violate laws and usages which it was deemed dangerous to infringe; that they have entered on wars with no views but those connected with personal glory; and that they have only considered the prosperity of their country an object of their care, as it was calculated to promote their individual interests and reputation. The character of the princes of the blood in Persia can never be That of the correctly known. They always act under great restraint. Their biood? 0 ^ manners are in general kind and prepossessing; as their principal object is to attach to their person those with whom they associate, and to gain a popularity that may promote their future advancement. Though the situation of these princes should impress them with the necessity of great prudence, if not of dissimulation, the flattery of those by whom they are surrounded, and the arrogance of high birth, very frequently counteract these salutary impressions: and, when intrusted with the exercise of authority, they often display as much628 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap , xxvi violence as if their brows were already encircled with that crown w hich is to vest them with despotic and uncontrolled power. of the minis- The ministers and chief officers of the Court of Persia are almost ters and chief officers of the always men of polished manners, well skilled in the business of their respective departments, of pleasant conversation, subdued temper, and very acute observation: but these agreeable and useful quali ties are, in general, all that they possess. Nor is virtue or liberal knowledge to be expected in men whose lives are wasted in attention to forms ; whose means of subsistence are derived from the most cor rupt sources ; whose occupation is intrigues that have always the same objects, that of preserving themselves, or of ruining others ; who can not, without danger, speak any language but that of flattery and deceit ; and who are, in short, condemned, by their condition, to be venal, artful, and false. There have, no doubt, been many ministers of Persia whom it would be injustice to class in this general descrip tion : but even those most distinguished for their virtues and their talents, have been forced, in some degree, to accommodate their principles to their station; and, unless where the confidence of their sovereign has placed them beyond the fear of rivals, necessity has compelled them to practise habits of subserviency and dis simulation, which are at variance with that truth and integrity that can alone constitute a claim to the respect which all are disposed to grant to good and great men.

The religious orders in Persia are divided into several classes, of the reii- The character of the few who have attained very high rank, has been S10us0^ders • before noticed. They are usually men of learning, of mild tem per, and retired habits. They are very careful to preserve the respect they enjoy, by cherishing those impressions that are enter tained of their piety and humility. It is rare to see them intolerant, except in cases where they deem the interest of that religion, of which they are the head, in danger. The lower classes of the priesthood in Persia are commonly of a very opposite character to their superiors. With little knowledge, and great pretensions, they demand a respect which they seldom receive; and are, in consequence, among the most discontented of the community. The general disposition of the Persians to treat strangers of a dif ferent religion with kindness and hospitality, is a subject of con stant irritation to them. They rail at all communication with infidels, and endeavour to obtain an importance with the lower orders of the people by a display of their bigotry and intolerance. This class of men are often accused, by their countrymen, of indulging in the gratification of the worst passions of the mind. To say a man hates like a moollah, is to assert that he cherishes towards another, sentiments of the most inveterate hostility. There is a considerable difference of character among the inha- of the inhabi- bitants of the various cities and towns of Persia, which originates llTtovnT™630 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap , xxvi in the opposite feelings and habits which thej have derived from their ancestors. The natives of Kazveen, Tabreez, Hamadan, Shiraz, and Yezd, are as remarkable for their courage, as those of Koom, Kashan, and Isfahan, are for their cowardice. The former are chiefly descended from martial tribes; while the fore fathers of the latter have, for many centuries, pursued civil occu pations. But, though some of the citizens of Persia are less warlike than others, the different shades of character which this occasions are not of so much consequence as to prevent their being included in a general description. The whole of this com munity may be deemed, as far as regards their personal appear ance, a fine race of men: they are not tall; but it is rare to see any of them diminutive or deformed, and they are in general strong and active. Their complexions vary from a dark olive to a fairness which approaches that of a northern European : and if they have not all the bloom of the latter, their florid healthy look often gives them no inconsiderable share of beauty. As a people, they may be praised for their quickness of apprehension, their vivacity, and the natural politeness of their manners. They are sociable and cheerful; and, with some remarkable exceptions, as prodigal in disbursement as they are eager of gain *. The higher classes of the citizens of Persia are kind and indulgent masters; and the lower ranks are, as far as respects the active performance of their duty, and the prompt execution of the orders they receive, the best of servants. In coun tries where the law grants equal protection to all ranks of society, * The lower classes of merchants in Persia are often very avaricious and sordid.

In the latter, where there are no middle classes, the servant is often the humble friend, and lives in habits of intimacy that could only exist where the actual distinction is so great as to remove all danger of either forgetting the inequality of their condition. The falsehood of the Persians is proverbial: nor are the inhabit ants of that country forward to deny this national reproach: but they argue, that this vice appertains to the government, and is the natural consequence of the condition of the society in which they hve: and there can be no doubt, that when rulers practise violence and oppression, those who are oppressed will shield themselves by every means within their power; and when they are destitute of combination and strength, they can only have recourse to art and duplicity. Nor is the moral character always debased by the use of this species of defence: instances continually occur in Persia, as in other countries subject to an arbitrary government, where the head of a village, or the magistrate of a city, entitles himself to the gratitude and admiration of those under him, by a virtuous and undaunted perseverance in falsehood, by which he endangers his own hfe and property, to save others who consider him as their guardian and protector. The frame of private society in Persia is, perhaps, still more calcu lated to render men artful and false than the constitution of their government. The wives and slaves of a despotic husband and master must have all the vices of their debased condition. The first lessons which their children learn from the example of those they love, is to practise deceit; and this early impression is confirmed by all their632 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap .xxvi future habits. They may hear and admire moral sentences upon the beauty and excellence of truth; but prudence warns them against a rigid adherence to so dangerous a virtue. The oaths which they con stantly use to attest their veracity, are only proofs of their want of it. They swear by the head of the king, by that of the person they address, by their own, by that of their son, that they are not asserting what is false: and if a stranger should continue to evince suspicion, they sometimes exclaim, ' Believe me; for, though a Persian, I am speaking truth.' There are, no doubt, some of the natives of Persia who do not deserve to be included in this general description, and who are distinguished by their regard for truth: but their numbers are too inconsiderable to save their countrymen from the reproach of falsehood, as a prevalent national vice.

They are easily innamed into passion, and act, when under its influence, like men careless of the result. A stranger, who is unacquainted with the nature of the government, and the latitude of speech which it permits in those whom it oppresses, is surprised to hear the meanest inhabitant of a town venting imprecations^ against his superiors, nay, sometimes against the sacred person of the king himself. These extraordinary ebulli tions of passion, which are very common among the lower orders in Persia, generally pass unheeded. Sometimes they may provoke a reproof, or a few blows; but they never receive consequence from the unwise interference of power to repress them. * The Persians not only vent their abuse on the person who has offended them, but on his whole kindred, and more particularly his female relatives. Their abuse is generally very obscene.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. ^ Many of the inhabitants of the principal cities in Persia are men chap.xxvi of some education : but even those who are not so, are remarkable for the fluency of their language. They express themselves with of language/ a freedom and boldness that is not always restrained by the dis- parity of rank between them and the person whom they address, tion, Hajee Ibrahim, the late Prime Minister of Persia, who gloried in the name of citizen, used to delight in relating a dialogue which took place between his brother, who was Beglerbeg, or Governor of Istahan, and a seller of vegetables in that city *.—On an extra ordinary impost being laid upon every shop, the latter forced him- self into the governor's presence when he was giving public audience, and exclaimed, that he was totally unable to pay the tax which had been imposed on him. ' You must pay it, or leave the city,' was the reply. 44 I cannot pay it,' said the man ; « and to what other place can I go? 44 You may either proceed to Shiraz, or Kashan, ' if you like those towns better than this,' said the governor. ' Your ' brother,' replied the shopkeeper, ' is in power at one of these ' cities, and your nephew at the other: what relief can I expect ' in either?'—' You may proceed to court,' said the ruler, ' and ' complain to the king, if you think I have committed injustice.' ' Your brother, the Hajee, is prime minister,' said the man. ' Go ' to Hell!' exclaimed the enraged governor, ' and do not trouble ' me any more!'—' The holy manf, your deceased father, is * Hajee Ibrahim repeated this anecdote to me with great animation. He, indeed, particularly delighted in mentioning any thing that reflected honour upon the spirit of tue citizens of Persia, whom it was his policy through life to support against the wandering tribes of that country. t The name of the father of the governor was Hajee Hashe. The expression used by the shopkeeper was Hajee-murhoom, which means the deceased hajee, or 'pilgrim.' vol. ii. 4 aj554 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap .xxvi ' perhaps there,' said the undaunted citizen. The crowd could n0 ^ SU pp r ess their smiles at the boldness of their countryman : and the governor, who shared the general feeling, bade the com plainant retire, and he would attend to his case, provided he would not bring a curse upon his family, by insisting that they shut him out of all hopes of justice, both in this world, and in that which is to come. General cha- The character of the military tribes differs essentially from that of condition of the other inhabitants of Persia. The chiefs of these clans are often as fcTber 111 * 17 much distinguished for their generosity as their courage. They are, from their condition, less artful than the ministers and principal civil officers of the kingdom: but they cannot be deemed exempt from that vice, though it is corrected by their pride and violence. Arrogant from birth, and surrounded, from infancy, by devoted dependents, their minds are habituated to overrate their own pre tensions, and depreciate those of others. When inflamed with passion, they in an instant lose all that courtly manner which they are accustomed to assume, and give way to the most ungovern able rage. They seldom suffer from the bold imprudence of the language which they use on these occasions, as they can always plead in excuse the habits of the rude class to which they belong * : and the consideration they demand, upon this ground, is hardly * I one day heard a nobleman of one of these tribes use the most violent and insulting language, when speaking of the prime minister. His imprudence appeared greater, as some of the minister's particular friends were present. Apprehen sive of the consequence, I next day asked him, if any thing had happened. « It is all a settled,' he said : ' I have made an apology. I told the minister that I was an « Eelleatee, (a man of a wandering tribe); and that, you know,' he added, laughing, « is an excuse for any thing wrong that a man can say or do.'THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. ever refused, even by the monarch himself, if he has been the object of their intemperance. The character of these military nobles may be said to change with the state of their country : when that is settled for any long period, they lose a great deal of their native honesty and violence. Educated at the capital, where, in youth, they are generally kept as hostages for the good conduct of their fathers; and compelled to constant attendance on the king after they have attained manhood; they become in time courtier's, and are not, except in being more haughty, materially different from the other nobles and principal officers of the country. We can neither praise them, nor any other of the higher ranks in Persia, for their strictness in either moral or religious duties: to the for mer, they do not even pretend to give much attention; and though they are careful as to the observance of all the forms of the latter, they often appear indifferent as to the substance, and are in the habit of discussing the tenets and dogmas of their faith with a freedom that sometimes borders upon impiety*. • In Persia, religion is a favourite topic of conversation, and particularly when a stranger of an opposite faith to that of Mahomed is of the party. It is not unusual to hear this subject treated in a manner which proves, at least, that there is the utmost latitude of speech. I have frequently listened to these discussions with some sur prise. t heard a person of high rank one day exclaim, in a mixed company, in which some priests were maintaining the sacred nature of the claims of the descendants of the prophet: ' This is all very well for superstitious fools who know no better: but I ' have travelled and read, and have more than once met with a dog of a Syud, and ' an an S el of a Jew speech produced a very hearty laugh at the expense of the holy man who had commenced the conversation. I find in one of my manuscripts a very ludicrous instance of the open impiety of a nobleman of rank now living in Khorassan. He heard a moollah describe, in the pulpit, the manner in which theTHE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap .xxvi The character of the Eelleats, or men who continue to dwell in tents, is very opposite to that of the inhabitants of cities. They ha\e the virtues and vices of their condition ; are sincere, hospitable, and brave; but rude, violent, and rapacious. They are not in need of falsehood and deceit, and therefore not much in the habit of practis ing them : but if they have fewer vices than the citizens of Persia, it is evidently the absence of temptation, and the ignorance of luxury and refinement, which give them all the superiority they boast; for it is remarked, that they never settle in towns, or enter them as victors, without exceeding the inhabitants in every species of profligacy The females of Persia who dwell in towns are usually placed in the situation of slaves; and have, therefore, many of those quali ties which belong to that condition. The different shades of charac ter of a race who can hardly be said to have any influence in the community, is of little importance; and if it were otherwise, we cannot have sufficient information of the subject to form any correct judgment upon it. If common report is to be credited, or if we grant our belief to the tales of Persian writers, the art and ingenuity angels Monker and Nakir visited the grave the moment after the corpse is deposited in it. He went away, determined to satisfy his mind of the truth of this assertion by a physical experiment: and the next time he heard the priest mention the subject, he exclaimed, before the astonished congregation, ' All that fellow says is a lie! « My servant,' he addtd, « died four days ago; and as I was resolved to discover the « truth, I stuffed his mouth quite full with dry grain. I have since opened his grave, « and the grain is exactly where it was placed: it is therefore quite impossible,' he continued, ' that he could have either spoken to man or angel!' • It would be disgusting to enter into a catalogue of the vices of a people among whom the indulgence of unnatural lust is not considered a crime.THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. of the women of that country are very often successful in eluding the jealous vigilance of their domestic tyrants. Of the females of the wandering tribes we have already spoken : they enjoy a fair portion of liberty; and if they are inferior to the natives of cities in beauty of person and softness of manner, they are superior to them in industry, in chastity, and many other virtues. We meet, indeed, with frequent examples, among this class, of an elevation of sentiment, and an heroic courage, which nothing but the freedom of their condition could inspire. In speaking generally* of the inhabitants of Persia, we may describe them as a handsome, active, and robust race of men, of lively imagination, quick apprehension, and of agreeable and prepos sessing manners. As a nation, they may be termed brave; though the valour they have displaj^ed, like that of every other people in a similar condition of society, has, in a great degree, depended upon the character of their leaders, and the nature of those objects for which they have fought. Their vices are still more prominent than their virtues. Compelled, by the nature of their government, to have recourse, on every occasion, to art or violence, they are alternately submissive and tyrannical. Many of their more serious * This character of the Persians only describes the Mahomedan population of that country. That of the Armenians who live in Persia may be given in a few- words : they are a submissive and humble race, who endeavour, by habits of industry, to obtain a livelihood among a people by whom they are treated with harshness and contempt. The Jews are. much more despised than the Armenians, and their character and condition are more degraded. We have before spoken (Vol. I. page 273,) of the few families of Guebers, or ' worshippers of fire,' who remain in Persia, and whom their Mahomedan conquerors seem to tolerate, that they may enjoy their triumph by protracted oppression.638 THE HISTORY OF PERSIA. chap .xxvi defects of cbaracter may be attributed to the same cause: and there is, perhaps, no country in which so much of the immorality of its inhabitants can be referred to a bad system of internal adminis tration as Persia. This reflection, though it may mitigate the sense we entertain of the depravity of individuals, leaves but little hope of their amendment; for it is evident that can alone be effected by the concurrence of many radical changes, with a complete alteration in their political condition; an event which neither their past history nor present state can lead us to anticipate.
