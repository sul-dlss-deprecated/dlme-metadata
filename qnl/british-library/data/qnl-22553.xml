Many persons are dubious of carrying out concrete work in winter time for fear that night frosts may injure the newly-laid concrete, being unaware that such work can be safely undertaken provided certain precautions are observed and the freshly laid concrete suitably protected. The most convenient methed to adopt for exterior concrete work is to use hot water for mixing. The temperature of the water should be about 150° F. and in most cases the water can readily be drawn from the domestic water supply. Mixing is carried out in the usual manner, the cement, sand and stone being first mixed in their dry state before any water is added. On no account should the hot water be added to the cement alone or frozen aggregate be used. Experience shows that when water of the above temperature is added to the mix, the temperature of the concrete is raised to about 65° F. giving sufficient heat for the chemical action involved in the setting and hardening of the cement to take place. In order that the heat may be retained and the chemical action continued, all freshly placed concrete should be covered at night with waterproof paper, straw, sacks, hessian or similar dry material, which should be firmly held down to prevent it becoming dislodged. Sacks partly filled with straw and laid flat on the surface give excellent protection. When the surface has to be protected before the concrete has set, the covering should be kept just clear of the surface, taking care that all draughts are excluded. The protective covering should be kept in position until the concrete has hardened, but during the day if the temperature is well above freezing point, the covering should be removed and the work cured in the usual manner. m.s.i.The Bapco Club BAHREIN ISLAND, PERSIAN GULF, / The Petroleum -one0 i &lt;; v ! v The 9th February 1937.

If a Government servant intends to draw his leave-salary in any of Colonial leave-saiary Bis Majesty's Colonies, the Audit Officer who audits his pay in his last post TATa^eSia^^ will furnish him with a warrant addressed to the Colonial Officer only on Colony, condition that any fund subscriptions due from him shall either be paid in advance or taken by deduction ; in the latter case, the warrant to the Colony will show only the net amount payable after such deduction. 6. A Government servant taking leave out of India on medical certificate should take with him one copy of the Medical Eeport upon his case, and be prepared to produce it before the Medical Board at the India Office, if required to do so. 7. If a Government servant proceeds on extraordinary leave out of India, or Certificate of leave on leave on average pay out of India during which he does not propose to draw ^ g c ®8 Mr y w certain leave-salsry, or if a Government servant proceeds to a Colony, he should obtain a certificate of leave in Form Ko. II under the Supplementary Rules from the Audit Officer who audits his pay in his last post. This certificate has to be presented by the Government servant to the Secretary of State or the High Commissioner for India if he is on leave in Europe, North Africa, America, or the West Indies and applies for extension of leave or for permission to return to duty or for a last-pay certificate before returning to duty. 8. Subscriptions on account of the Bengal, Bombay and Madras Civil Subscriptiona to Funds, and the Bengal and Madras Service Family Pension Fund may be Funds • paid either in India or in England at the option of the subscriber and arrange ment should be made for such payment by the subscriber. In the case of Military Officers in Civil employ subscriptions on account of Indian Military Service Family Pension Fund will be deducted from the leave-salary of the officers concerned. Officers should see that the necessary deductions are made. Premiaan.d subscriptions on Postal Insurance policies and contracts for monthly allowances, subscriptions for the Bengal Uncovenanted Service Family Pension Fund, the Bombay Family Pension Fund of Govt, servants, the General Family Pension Fund and the Hindu Family Annuity Fund are not payable in England. 9. Subscriptions to the General Provident Fund may be paid by remittance in cash to the Audit Office which audited his pay in his last post in the case of a Government servant on leave who draws his leave-salary from a Colonial Treasury, but when a subscriber draws his leave-salary from the Home Treasury2 Payment in a Colony.

Transfer of pay ment from one Colony to another. of the Government of India, his subscription may be paid by deduction from such ssilvvrv* A Government servant who draws his leave-salary from the Home Treasury and who desires to subscribe during his leave or any part of it must notify his intention beforehand in order to allow of the deductions from his leave-salary being noted in bis leave-salary certificate. Unless an extension of leave is granted, the option thus notified will be final _ o 10. Before departure on leave, a subscriber to the Indian Civil Service Provident Fund should intimate to the Account Officer of the province or department in which he is permanently employed the amount which he desires to contribute monthly during his leave. A subscriber to the Bengal and Madras Service Family Pension Fund should communicate with the Accountant- Gene ral, Central Revenues; and a subscriber to any other fund with the Secretary of the fund concerned, informing him of the arrangement he proposes to make regarding the payment of his subscription during his absGncG. 11.' Contributions due under the Indian Civil Service Family Pension Regulations must be paid in England in sterling. If a subscriber, previous to quitting India, has commenced the payment of any donation by instalments, he may either complete the payment of his donation in India before leaving or pay the remaining instalments in England at English rates. Subscribers to this fund will obtain from the Audit Officer who audits their pay in their last posts, a certificate of the date up to which they have paid their subscriptions. 11-A. Subscriptions under the Superior Services (India) Family Pension Fund are payable daring leave ; but the Secretary of State in Council may at his discretion permit recovery of subscriptions due over a prolonged period of leave on medical certificate or of extraordinary leave without pay to be postponed until the expiration of such leave. 12. When a Government servant arrives in the United Kingdom, he should at once report his arrival by letter to the High Commissioner for India, at India House, Aldwych, London, W.C. 2, giving an address at which letters will find him, and he should forward his leave-salary certificate to the same authority on arrival, or as soon as he receives it from India. 12-A. Military Officers in Civil employ are bound by the rules contained in paragraphs 883 and 884 of the Regulations for the Army in India, requiring that permission shall be obtained before visiting certain foreign ^ countries named ^ in those paragraphs and prescribing the procedure for obtaining such permission and the necessary passports. 13. The leave-salary (including the sterling leave-salary ot Government servants drawing their leave-salary in India or in a Dominion or Colony) of all Government servants is issued from the Home Treasury monthly in arrear on the first day of each calendar month. It will be paid to the Government servant on his personal application, or to his banker or other agent, duly authorised under power-of-attorney, on production of a life certificate filled up and executed in the manner directed thereon (except in cases where proof of existence is not required owing to the banker having been permitted to execute a Deed of Covenant and Indemnity guaranteeing the Secretary of State or the High Commissioner against loss consequent on his dispensing with the production of such proof), or on presentation of a payment form comprising a receipt and a life certificate both duly completed by the Government servant. A supply of life certificate forms may be obtained from the High Commissioner on the Government servant's written application. Note 1.— If the leave-salary is drawn by a banker or agent who has executed a general bond of indemnity, a life certificate should bo produced at least once a year. Note 2. —If the ('ovorumeut servant intimates to the High Commissioner his electiou of this method, he will be regularly supplied with the requisite payment form as the due date of issue approaches. 14. Payment of leave-salary will not be made by a Colonial authority unless the Government servant produces his copy of the warrant. Each payment made in the Colony will be endorsed upon the warrant. When no space for the entry of endorsements of payment remains upon the back of a Colonial leave-salary warrant, or when a warrant is lost or destroyed, the Government servant concerned should make an application for a fresh warrant through the Colonial Disbursing Officer to the Audit Officer who issued the original warrant. 15. If the transfer from one Colony to another of payment of the leave- salary of a Government servant is sanctioned by the Colonial authorities, such VJg transfer must be reported by the G-overnment servant to the Governor- General in Council and to the High Commissioner. 16. If a Government servant drawing his leave-salary in a Colony Transfer of payment desires to transfer payment to the Home Treasury, tie can do on produc-f' r % h °o&lt;,rn, T rd tion of his warrant to the High Commissioner. If one drawing his leave-salary vtce versd. from the Home Treasury desires to transfer payment to a Colony, he must obtain a warrant from the High Commissioner. A transfer of this kind must be reported by the Government servant to the Governor-General in Council. 17. A Government servant absent on leave in Europe, North Africa, Extension or com. America or the West Indies who wishes to have his leave extended or com- I]DUtation of leave - muted, must apply to the High Commissioner for India about three months before the expiry of his leave, and unless the extension is desired on medical grounds, or is for a period of not more than 14 days, he must produce with his application evidence that the Government on whose cadre he is borne has been referred to by him and has no objection to the extension or commutation desired. It is in exceptional cases only that the High Commissioner will grant an extension without the production of such evidence and then for such period only as may be necessary to obtain the orders of the Government concerned, which will be sought by telegraph at the applicant's expense. 18. If on medical grounds a Government servant on leave in any of the localities named in paragraph 17 desires an extension for more than 14 days, he must satisfy the Medical Board at the India Office of the necessity for the extension. In order to do so, he must, as a general rule, appear at the India Office for examination by the Board, but in special cases, and particularly if he is residing at a distance of more than sixty miles from London, a certi ficate in a form to be obtained from the High Commissioner may be accepted if signed by two medical practitioners. A certificate obtained outside the United Kingdom and signed by foreigners must be attested by consular or other authority as bearing the signature of qualified medical practitioners. If appli cation for extension be delayed until the last two months of leave, advice of any extension granted for a period of more than seven days will be sent to India by telegraph, and the cost of the telegram will ordinarily be charged to the Government servant. 19. If a Government servant on leave in any of the localities named in paragraph 17 has been granted leave on medical certificate and desires an extension on grounds other than medical, he must satisfy the Medical Board as prescribed in paragraph 18 above that he has recovered his health. Any such extension without medical certificate will only be admissible if the exten sion was due at the time the original leave was granted. In the case of a Commissioned Medical Officer the local Government will make a reference to the Director-General, Indian Medical Service, before grant ing the permission. 20. A Government servant on leave out of India elsewhere than in^any of the localities named in paragraph 17, who wishes to have his leave extended or commuted must apply three months before the expiry of the leave to the authority in India which granted it. 21. If an application made under paragraph 20 above is for an extension of leave on medical certificate, it must be accompanied by a certificate from two medical practitioners in the following form :— ' We hereby certify that we have carefully examined C. D. of the who is suffering from and we declare upon our honour that, according to the best of our judgment and belief, he is at present unfit for duty in India and that it is absolutely necessary for the recovery of his health that his present leave, which will expire in India on , shall be extended by^ Date Flace. The certificate must describe in full detail the nature of the disease and the present condition of the Government servant. If it be signed by foreigners, it must be attested by consular or other authority as bearing the signatures of qualified medical practitioners. F. R. 6A.22. An extension of leave will not be granted by the High Commissioner to a Government servant to whom no leave-salary certificate or Colonial leave salary warrant has been issued, unless he produces a certificate of leave {vide paragraph 7 ante). 23. Leave out of India on medical certificate may be commuted into leave without medical certificate if such leave was due at the time when the original leave was granted, and if the Government servant seeking commutation is certi fied, in the manner prescribed, to have recovered his health. When extension of the commuted leave is applied for, the application must be supported by evidence that the Government servant's local Government consents to the extension of his leave. 24. A Government servant who remains absent after the end of his leave is entitled to no leave-salary for the period of such absence unless his leave is extended by the local Government, Wilful absence from duty after the expiry of leave may be treated as misbehaviour for the purpose of Fundamental Eule 15. Return from leave. 25. A Government servant may not, without the permission of the authority which granted him leave, return to duty more than fourteen days before the end of long leave. The rule applies to Military Officers subject to the Military Leave Hules. He must obtain permission to return to duty from the local Government. 26. A Government servant, who is required to produce a medical certificate of fitness before returning to duty, must obtain permission to return to duty before so returning. 27. If the Government servant desiring to return is on leave in any of the localities named in paragraph 17, his application must be made to the High Commissioner, and he must satisfy the Medical Board at the India Office of his fitness to return at least two months before the expiry of his leave. In order to do so, he must follow the procedure prescribed in paragraph 18 above. When the Medical Board has been satisfied, the High Commissioner will grant permission to return. 28. If the Government servant desiring to return is on leave out of India elsewhere than in the localities named in paragraph 17, his application must be made to the authority which granted his leave and must be accompanied by a certificate of fitness in the prescribed form. 29. Permission to return will not be granted to a Government servant to whom no leave-salary certificate or colonial leave-salary warrant has been issued, until he produces a certificate of leave. Last-pay certificate. 30. Before returning to duty, a Government servant on leave in Europe must obtain a last-pay certificate from the High Commissioner and bring it with him to India and not leave it with his Home Agent, as it will be required for presentation to the Audit Officer if it is desired to draw on arrival in India the advance which is permissible under paragraph 35, In such an event the English last-pay certificate should be with the Government servant as it facilitates his identification at the Audit Office and the advance has to be recorded on the certificate. A last-pay certificate will not be granted to a Government servant to whom no leave-salary certificate has been issued unless he produces a certificate of leave. A Government servant who has drawn his leave-salary on a warrant must, on return to India, deliver to the Audit Officer, by whom the pay of the post which he will join will be audited, his copy of the warrant which will serve as a last-pay certificate. Procedure on return 31. A gazetted Government servant must report his return to duty to the Government under which he is serving. A Chaplain must report his return to the Bishop of his Diocese also. 32. A Government servant is not entitled on his return from leave to resume, as a matter of course, the particular post he vacated before his departure on leave, even though that post may be his substantive post; he must report his return to duty and await orders. Nom—Membe/s of the Engineer or Upper Subordinate Establishment of the Public Works Department should, on arrival at the port of debarkation, report themselves personally to the Secretary in the Public Works Departmenta of Bengal, Madras, Bombay or Burma, as the case may be, and ask tor orders. If they return via Karachi, they should apply to the office of the Executive Engineer, Earachi Canals, for orders. o o33. A Government servant may return to India by any port and his leave ends on the day preceding that on which the vessel arrives at the port where he last quits it. If, however, the leave from which he returns is of four months' duration or less, his leave ends on the day preceding that on which he takes charge of his duties, unless he takes charge in the afternoon when the leave terminates on and includes that day. 34. On return to duty, the last-pay certificate obtained from the High Commissioner should be exchanged for a last-pay certificate which the Audit Office of the province to which he has been posted will furnish addressed to the Treasury or office at which, after his return, the Government servant intends to draw his pay and allowances. 35. A Government servant returning from leave out of India may be Advances, granted an advance of his leave-salary for the unexpired portion of his leave subject to a maximum of 35 days from the date of embarkation for India. On arrival in India an advance may, if he desires it, be paid to a Government servant by or under the order of the Audit Office of the province in which the advance is sought to be drawn under Article 159 (ft) of the Civil Account Code, Volume I. To a Chaplain appointed before the 7th June 1923, who is proceeding on leave to England, an advance of three months' leave-falary may be made, provided that no part of the leave is on average pay. Such an advance is not recoverable in the event of the Chaplain's death. To a Military Officer subject to the Military Furlough Eegulations of 1868 proceeding on furlough (not combined with privilege leave) to England, an advance of furlough pay may, if he desires it, be made for three months from the date of embarkation. Payments in continuation will be made in England on the expiration of four months from that date. 36. A Government servant on leave may not take any service or accept Acc °^ a ^ ° f leave any employment without obtaining the requisite sanction in accordance with serviLe urmg eave * Fundamental Rule 69— 1.—A Civilian Government servant on leave, who has receivel orders from the War Office or any other department of State in England to undertake any duty in the case of a national emergency, should obtain the permission of the Secretary of State before comply ing' with such orders. 37. Government servants from India in the United Kingdom suffering Hospital for Tropical from Tropical Diseases are not always aware that, whether they are actually g SS EndsIeigh on leave on medical certificate or not, it may be to their advantage to appear before the Medical Board in order that the Board may advise them as to the best steps to take regarding such diseases. Arrangements have been made for the diagnosis and preliminary treat ment of the diseases, and for the admission of officers, when necessary, as in-patients at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Endsleigh Gardens, K W. 1. A report is furnished to officers by the Hospital, which they can take with them to their own Medical adviser to enable him to carry out the treatment suo-o-ested. The cost of the examination and preliminary treatment at the Hospital, and also that of the accommodation supplied to officers admitted as in patients, is defrayed by the India Office. The Hospital is, however, permitted to charge a special extra fee to senior officers of the Civil Department who on admission as in-patients, are, at their own request given special accommodation. This extra fee is payable by the officer himself, the India Office paying that portion only of the total charge which represents the cost of ordinary, as distinct from special accommodation. To secure these advantages, however, a recommendation to the Hospital for Tropical Diseases by the Medical Board is necessary, and, therefore, Government servants who wish to avail themselves of this arrangement should apply to appear before the Medical Board of the India Office as soon as possible after arrival.

It may kindly be stated more fully unless the same was confidential in which case the fact of its being may kindly be mentioned explicitly.
