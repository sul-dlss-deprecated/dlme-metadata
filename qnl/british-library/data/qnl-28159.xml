From Captain G.S.de Gaury, M.C., Political Agent, Kuwait; To The Bonnie the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bus hire. S&amp;ucati onal Problems of Kuwait» Sir, I have the honour to say that I had today an opportunity of discussing with the Shaikh the educational problems of his State# g # The technically qualified youths in the State have all been absorbed into employment by the Kuwait Oil Company and if Kuwaitis are to take advantage of the opportunities likely to occur in the future with the develop ment of the Company and with perhaps other companies there is no time to b© lost# 3 # The Shaikh, the notables and merchants of the Town are well aware of this and the merchants, with the blessing of the Shaikh, recently drew up a petition requesting that an additional tax be placed on the importation of goods other than those imported by British subjects&gt;and al lotted to education# 4 # This has be approved by His Excellency and the sum so derived is to be accumulated until it reaches a useful figure which is calculated to be in six months time, A sub-commit tee of the Municipal Council, to whom the problem of improvement in education is entrusted is to make recommendations for the Shaikh* s approval for the use of the sum available, 5. The present intention is to employ a number of foreign masters, perhaps five or six, at the existing ABMADIYA School founded in 19 81.2 — Opinion varies as to frcm i«iiere the masters should cane• Some merchants and perhaps the majority are of the opinion that they should be Iraqis. The Shaikh favours Syrians because they are less likely to be 'politicians' and because Syria has a longer history of modern education. Any idea which once obtained, of sending off abroad an educational 'mission', that is a group of students, has been abandoned on grounds of expense. I thought from what His Excellency told me that the problem before Kuwait had not been clearly understood. 6* The situation is that in Kuwait there are about 50 Koranic schools which form preparatory schools, and two more advanced schools in both of which English is taug^it and taught well, the idimadiya and the xuaerioan mission School. 7 . It cannot be gainsaid that Kuwait would do well to increase and quickly the amount and quality of instruction at the Khmadiya School. Syrian masters, for political and educational reasons, would be, I agree with the shaikh, more suitable than Iraqis to undertake this. They could not hope however to give any technical or craft instruction, nor could Kuwait’s finances stand the establishment of a technical school. 8. I told the ohaikh, speaking in a personal and friendly way and not committing myself officially, that I would sound the Hon’ble the Political Resident and make enquiries as to the possibility of obtaining vacancies at a technical school abroad at fees which Kuwaitis would find within their means. 9 # i had in mind the technical schools of Palestine where the Hi^i Commissioner might find it possible to arrange for vacancies at the lowest rates consonant with expenses incurred in their training and where any stidents sent would have the benefit of Britl di superintendence 10 /- and assistance10 # In view of the probable future development of Kuwait and its position on the Imperial Air Route the problem would seem to be worth attention from a political point of view, leaving aside the benefit to Kuwaitis which exercises my mind less. 11. Furthermore, companies developing here must have trained men and failing Kuwaitis will have to be allowed to import foreigners which will have an adverse effect on their relations here and tend to accentuate the feeling of Inferiority and consequently the zenophobia which is never far below the surface in a country such as this coming for the first time in contact with a foreign and superior technique. 12* I therefore feel that these are matters worth bringing to your attention; firstly the apparent urgent naed for facilities for Kuwaitis to be trained at technical schools abroad after they have passed out of the Ahmadiya or ^uaerican Mission School and secondly that failing your instructions to the contrary some Syrian or Iraqi schoolmasters are likely to arrive here within the year. I attach in an appendix a list of the tradesmen which the Kuwait Oil Company has difficulty in finding or finds it impossible to obtain locally. I have added to this some other trades or professions in which Kuwaitis are or will be needed soon and against all I have placed a figure which represents the number which could be absorbed by the end of their training period. It is within the number which the State is likely to be able to send abroad and within the number of boys who would be qualified to go, that is having a knowledge of English, where It is necessary for their training, and who waild benefit by training. The list is intended to be indicative only of the requirements4 ** requirements and has of course not been furnished by the Shaikh, who would not feel it worth going into closely unless some new proposition were made; his former idea of sending boys abroad having been abandoned on the grounds of expense.

As far as I know pupils at these schools learn little beyond saying the Koran or rather parts of it by heart* However, this is all to the good in so far as it teaches them their own religion at an impressionable age, and these schools might be kept on, though perhaps reduced in numbers, as kindergarten schools for children up to 5 years of age or so* Stage B* The next stage should be to provide free for all -—“ in Arabic. young Kuwaitis simple instructions in the three R* f s*Z In whatever way the boy will have to earn his daily bread when he grows up this knowledge will be ol use to him e*g. a diver will be able to check his accounts and so be less in the hands of his employer• These schools might be presided over by the best of the present teachers in the Koranic schools, and the age of the pupils might be from 5 to 8 or 10 years. Stage C * The next stage might be for boys from about 10 years upwards who intend to learn English* Such boys should continue their instruction^ in Arabic and begin to learn simple English. From this stage upwards it is arguable that education should not be free but paid for. I do not think it is much use for boys who will ordinarily earn their living as divers etc. being given a knowledge of English. Stage D * This would improve the further education for boys under Stage C. In order to provide for la_carrieiie ouverte aux talents the Shaikh might give a few free scholar ships to specially promising students from Stage B to C and upwards.5 So much for my general ideas on Kuwait education. With regard to the specific points raised in your letter I agree with you and the Shaikh that Syrian masters would he preferable to Iraqi ones. What about Palestinian ones ? Whoever they are they will have to be carefully chosen and should represent quality rather than quantity, i.e. as a beginning it would be better to have a few well paid and good ones rather than many and indifferently paid. 6. With regard to technical education I quite agree in its importance, and think the idea of sending Kuwaitis to the technical school in Palestine is a good one - vide paragraph 9 of your letter. Will you please write to the scholastic authorities there, sending me a cop^of your letter, stating that I have asked you to make necessary enquiries. When their reply has been received the Shaikh will be able to decide how many students can be sent there. 7. It is &lt;8f course for the Shaikh to decide on what lines general education in Kuwait should follow, but you might inform him, verbally and informally, of my views as given above and let me know what he thinks. P.S . I find on reading through the above that I have missed out a most important item in my educational programme. In addition to purely •educatianal 1 knowledge the young Kuwaiti should be given some sort of 1 moral 1 training: he should grow up a good citizen as well as an educated one.COtlFIDitfTIi iL.

The expenses mi $ht I think be covered jfou h y a comparatively low suu, well worth the results which would he achieved. on’ble Lt-Colonel ir Treuchard Fowls, K, ...I.B. ,C*B#I5, , Boxitical Kesidei^t in the Persian Gulf, Camp at kov^fViM- 2 - r Certainly the cost of educating a boy at the AmerioaE Softool in Beirut is extremely li-ctle, I hear about £.4S/- a year only and it would be suitable for the poorer scholars. Victoria college, a Hueen Victoria Memorial School, with a British Board, one of whom is X third; the British Consul General in Alexandria, and with a British Headmaster , is probably more expensive. On the other hand, being what it is, and with a number of English boys in the School, it would be preferable to the American school for the sons of notables. r £he Board of Victoria College might I suppose consider reducing fees to meet the wishes of Government, Provided that they could be assured of a definite number of^ -ihis os an ; the right fashion, which might be done for Kuwait, in ten years by sending two boys to Victoria college, and three to Beirut, and maintaining that number in both Schools “or that period. 6 . It would in any case be leas costly than establish ing a British Arabic School at Cyprus as, I understand, has been suggested, or sending boys to England; as Italy sends Arab youths for free education in Italy.

Gr*S.cLe Gaury.Confidentia l From Political -ngent , nnwait . xO Political Hesident, Bushirc. No.C- Dated 1st November, 1938. aubjecti-Tjchnioal education for Kuwait. His Highness the Ruler of liuvmit has expressed to me a renewed interest in technical, education for Kuwaitis. 2, In February 1937 I made at his request, end with your permission, some enquiries from the Secretariat of the High Gommissio &lt;er in Palestine, about facilities for technical education in that country for boys from his state. The reply was not very satisfactory, from our point of view. There is no Government Technical School in Palestine and the only suitable non-Jewish School was a German run Orphanage. t 3, Since then there has come, with the finding of more Oil in Kuwait territory, a greater need for technical education while the preparedness of Kuwaiti boys for it, has increased; the standard of education being now higher than then. 4. The most need id workmen at present are (a) Motor Mechanics (b) Electrical mechanics (c) Master masons (d) Master carpenters (e) Vireless operators. nbout three vacancies being required in each category 5. The Iraq authorities have recently offered five free vacancies to Kuwait boys in one of their Government training colleges, and therefore would, I think, offer similar facilities in the Technical School, if not free, at least at aCo nfidential Government are busy on the Education question. In order that Sir Trenchard may have a clear idea of the Educations,! system in Kuwait he desires you to let him have by post a detailed picture of the present system in Kuwait, together with your comments on reforms, future policy etc. He desires that your report should 'i also include remarks on technical education.ft ? ’ &gt;• Confidential, No.C-34. v 3 Political Agency, Kuwait. January i6 t 1959. ^ \ My dear Sir Trenchard, ^Till you please refer to Captain Calloway^ D.O* No # 710-S of 14th )&gt;©oember, 1938, in which you required from me a detailed picture of the present education system in Kuwait, with remarks on technical Education, and comments on reforms, future policy etc. VT The Education system of Kuwait was touched r ) • upon in my memorandum No.C-238 of 8th July 1938, forwarding a Report on the Administration of Kuwait 9 - 11), and in my letters No.C-325 of 11th . ' h n n October and C-352 of 1st November. I wrote in the first 'As education goes in the Arabian Peninsular, the standard is quite high. At least every boy and nearly every girl, goes to school, if only a Koranic school, and those with aptitude, can go on to one of the three higher grade schools. In one of these there are employed four Palestinian school masters (approved as suitable by the Secretariat of the High Commissioner in Palestine, before being appointed in 1937.) who teach English and more advanced work than the local The Honourable Sir Trenohard Fowl©, K.C.I.E., C.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, BUSH IRE.- 2 - local school masters. In addition a number of paid teachers of English, Indians and others, spread the knowledge of that language. n Since writing the above the number of Palestinian masters in the three Kuwait Government schools has been doubled, and they have under them over 375 boys, while two Palestinian school mistresses teach in the new Government girl school. The number of Koranic schools, for very small boys, 25, remains the same, while the number of private preparatory schools is three. As the number of boys has considerably increase this year, the Education Department is contemplating the employment of a qualified Headmaster to deal with all the four schools, in place of the present acting one, who has been found to be below the standard required. 2. The curriculum in the Kuwait Government schools is intended to give a 'Secondary' education, as that term is undei*stood in the Middle East, but in fact the standard is rather lower than that elsewhere, because the schools have only recently started up, and the students are rather less well grounded before they enter the school. It is particularly wealc on the English side because the Palestinian masters, while they do speak English, are not really good at it. The books in use are those used in Iraqi schools, except that the English books are from the 'Oxford University Press'; having been brought by the Palestinian masters from Palestine. All the hooks are paid for by the students with the exceptio: of some very poor boys who are supplied with books free of charge by the Department.No fees are charged for boys, but girls have to pay Rs.2/- monthly. From next year the girls also will be given free education. The total income of the Education Department is Rs.49,000/- per annum, half being contributed by the Landing Department, and the other half being a special tax for this purpose of $ % on incoming goods. All of this sum is needed for the existing Educational programme. 3. The general aptitude of the boys is most encouragingly and surprisingly high. In spite of few opportunities in the past Kuwaitis have educated themselves in a remarkable way. Many of the younger merchants conduct business with India and England in English, while the Residency Agent at Sharja, and I think the majority of your vernacular staff in the Gulf are Kuwaitis. Good manners and absence of crime in Kuwait are most noticeable. It therefore seems fertile educational ground. 4. The present situation is that about 18 boys have passed out of the Government schools and are ready now for further education, which cannot be provided in Kuwait, leading up to lower standard University, or technical edcuation, and more, and better trained boys, will be coming on every year. Five of these have already been sent to the Baghdad Training College; the Iraq Government having volunteered to take them there free. Other Kuwaiti boys being educated abroad, at the expense of their parents, are as follows:- 2 Beirut. 10 Iraq. 1 al-Hasa, Saudi Arabia. 8 India (children of parents living in India).5. -4- you will aee i ra q is aiready taklag &amp; doislnan t jiart in the education Kuwait youths. of the most intelligent in isae the British I&amp;Bbassy erinced an interest in the education of Kuwaiti youths, and in addition, the juabaasador made vercal enquiries from the BhaiBh, and from the agency, about the 'lack of education in’ Kuwait' of which ho had been informed, no doubt by Govamiaant circle, in Baghdad. 6. I pointed out the danger of Iraqi “culture* in my letter Ho.C-585 of nth October. Only recently thore has been a violent demonstration in the Iraqi Capital by uncontrolled schoolboys, *hioh f in any case, cannot be called a suitable retreat for studenta. Th&amp; crino Statistics of Baghdad, if truthfully recorded, must b© some of the highest in the world. It has been a Press which violently attacks authority, occasional coupe d’etat, and is unusually noisy and dusty. I would therefor© emphasize my recommendation, to which i shall revert below, that the question of i-iighor ‘secondary* 1 education i.e. intermediate between the Kuwait advanced schools and (a) lower standard University or (b) technical schools, should be given our consideration and at least Government’s benevolent assistance, if not some slight financial support, which 1 believe it merits; and that the initiative should not be left by us to the Iraq Government. 7. For intelligent poor boys the education should of course be technical, not merely ’’liberal”. $ith regard to the actual number of boys requiring technical education i.e. who can readily•5' readily be absorbed by the Kuwait Oil Company arid local enterprises, please see para 4 of njy letter No.358 of 1st November, 1938, which I quote below for ready reference# The most needed workmen at present are (a) Motor Mechanics# (b) Electrical Mechanics. (o) Master Masons. (d) Master Carpenters. (e) tireless Operators. About three vacancies are required in each category. Trained Stenographers and Typists will also be needed. As I have said, there is need for all of these, to have further secondary education, before they can enter a technical school. Even when this additional work has been don®, where are the boys to go for their technical training? - i.e. to be carried out in the English, or/and Arabic languages# Q. India, from this, the educational, point of view, has, I regret, less appeal to Kuwaiti Arabs than hitherto and their eyes are naturally turned, in these days of what is called *th© Arab Renaissance** to the West, to Arabia and the Middle East 'Arab' Countries. The ideal would be to nave higher standard local schools, and a minor University and Technical College in the Persian Gulf, but there is, I presume, little hope of that, and in any case some time would be required to start such establishments; so, for the immediate future, it must be to the Middle Eastern Countries that we must look. 9. I take them in turn (a)va) I’alaatlne oan be of ao help to us. I attach a copy of the Jalsstlne aeoretarl&amp;t letter on the subject No.CF/75?./36 of 17th December, 1836. (b) Iraq has Secondary Schools, Training Colleges and a rechnioal Training school, and would probably be pleased to offer vacancies, but is it desirable that we should encourage Kuwaitis to take them up? as I have indicated above Baghdad has distinct cl la&amp;dvant&gt;ages as an educational centre# (c) Then there is Dgypt, I think perhaps that the British loabasey in Cairo could help us to find suitab, secondary coaching establishment©, and Technical Schools of not too high a standard, at not too high, a cost for Kuwait boy®, although a disadvantage is the distance from Kuwait# The fact that the Shaikh has an Agent th&amp;re, who could keep an eye on the boys might be an offset tu this disadvantage in the eyes of some parenta# 10, It is little use to 'drive* the Kuwait eduoatio] Department into making enquiries, and producing the money# They have little 'drive', are almost quite Ignorant of the outside world, except that of Iraq, which occasionally thrusts itself upon them, end have so far few resources# There is, however, I understand increasing interest being shown in British-foreign cultural relations, and an organization known as the British Council, under, I believe, the direction of Lord Lloyd and Mr. Harold Nicholson, provides English masters in Iraq, about £ 1,000 annually Ter Iraqi students in England, etc. The staff of that organization may also be able to help us if we consult them# 11. iipart from technical education there also remains the easier question of the higher educationeducation of boys for non-technical employment, mostly ] the sons of the Ruling family destined for administra tive posts, and no doubt, in one way and another, contact with foreigners. 12. % recommendations for the future are therefore as follows. NON- TffCHNI CAL iSDUCiiTION . 1 think we should, (a) if possible, secure reduoec fees for th© sons of sobj© of the less well off members of the Baling family, at Victoria College, Alexandria, \ and (b) encourage the Shaikh himself to send his sons there. If we fail in (a) and the parents agreed, we could fall beck on the American University, Beirut, but Victoria College is a British establishment, from which we can make preliminary confidential enquiries, without necessarily consulting beforehand the Shaikh, or the prospective parents* The number of boys under this heading (a) above, would be approximately 4 at one time. (c) TBCHNIGAL EDUCATION . The number now requiring further education prior to a Technical training, the most difficult problem, is as has been said above, approximately 18. We should, I think secure immediately, with the Shaikh*s agreement, a (British) English master to undertake education of this class of boys in English up to a standard which will enable them to enter a Technical school. A man of the right character would I have no doubt soon be oonsailted by the Kuwaitis, and the Agency, on all local educational problems, but his first task should be the English and advanced class. We should in this, I suggest,% ' £5 - 8 - I suggest, seek the financial aid and the advice of the British Council, and subsequently obtain their aid in the selection of a Technical College as soon as the first boys are ready for it. If part of the cost of such an appointment were borne by the British Council the Kuwait Government could I think be persuaded to pay part, up to the amount which they would have to pay for say an Egyptian or other educated oriental master, ffUTCRiS POLICY, ^ 13. Apart from the immediate and pressing problems, we should, in ray opinion, also have a long term policy for Kuwait, in this matter of education. It is not necessary to be an over-liberal Fairy God-mother, but we should at least be a calculating parent, and my . —^ personal view is that a well-found British-guided Minor University and Technical College, with low fees, established here (because of the climate , its intelligent inhabitants, and its particularly fertile educational ground^ or in Bahrain (where Kuwaitis could go) will nave in the long run a powerful effect for future good in the Persian Gulf, and in Eastern and Saudi Arabia. Even some of the better class Iraqis, ''V. ' 1 who find Victoria College too far away, might in time \ i send their sons to such a College. &amp; British master, such as I have suggested above in para 12, could no doubt put up a detailed proposition l on this subject, when he had had time to study the position on the spot. Sd/ G.S. de Gaury(Si V,,, Copy of letter No.C?/752/S6, dated 19th December, 1936, from the Palestine Secretariat, Jerusalem to the Political Agency, Kuwait. Please refer to my letter CF/752/36 of 30th October, 1936 regarding inter alia the technical training of boys from Kuwait in Palestine. question that we can be very helpful to you in this matter. There are three institutions which come under consideration for this prupose: (i) the Trade School of the Moslem Orphanage at Jerusalem* This institution offers only carpentry cabinet making and shoemaking. (ii) Schneller’s Orphanage at Jerusalem* This institution trains motor mechanics and fitters but as a Christian missionary ,institution it may be considered unsuitable by the Kuwait authorities. (iii) the Government Trade School at Haifa* It is not yet known when this will be opened. It will probably provide training in the first year after opening for carpentry and fitters only. During the first two years there will not be a full complement of Palestinian students Thereafter the entire accommodation will be required for Palestinians. The ffell course is three years and it follows that foreigners admitted for the first two years cannot complete a full course. If this difficulty can be overcome we should require evidence that 2. It does not appear after examination of the the proposed students from Kuwait have:&gt;2\ (a) a oomplete ©lementary education comparable with that provided in Palestine; (b) an adequate knowledge of Englisho No pupil, Palestinian or foreign, can be admitted who does not satisfy these conditions and it seems unlikely that boys from Kuwait will prove eligible for entry. if CON muj ..»• m • will Uni ini n t wmmmmmmmmm Fro r ' V TfAL \ P w 0 . 164-3 of 1939. ~ — ' u Receipt 1 Zs .z .

The India Office, London. I enclose herewith an interesting and most infomative letter, ]fo.^-34 t dated the 16th January 1939, on Kuwait education frcra de Gaury. I have been meaning to forward it with ray comments before now, but while fuwait rera&amp;ined in c disturbed conditicm I had other and more urgent Tuwaiti problems to deal with. Now that Kuwait has, I hope, settled down, we can consider the subject of its education. 2. I need hardly emphasise the importance of education at Kuwait (as weil as at the other Arab States of the Gulf) from our point of view as well as that of the States. On the type and quality of the education will largely depend whether the young Kuwaiti of the future will became a good citizen, or a discontented agitator, a thorn in the flesh of the shaikh and of oursexves. Youth Movements, and the like, as you are aware, have already begun to show tnemselvea in Kuwait, fanned by Iraqi propaganda. In the other hand as de Gaury points out - vide paragraph 3 of hia letter - Kuwaiti youths can compare favour ably with the youths of the neighbouring states, especially Iraq, and afford fertile educational ground. 3. I agree with de Geary - vide his paragraph 1 « that, as education goes in the Arabian Peninsula, the standard at Kuwait is quite high. In considering its ixaprovament the first essential is to try and avoid in Kuwfcit an educational ays tom, 8ich as exi * ta elsewhere, which will turn out students for whoa / there,c t f i &amp;&amp;■*£ota i J «tm to*# &amp;nl t99*wtni «s ^ r* ^ f' c ' 5 1 ij.oubs no ,%6« va^MXi «Si6X »e* ceiab ,»6-o;«r .nsJitX .1CIU*C »fc Kill ^dTOjaiJa „ Bi boat**** iU^T •it** tud ,voa *toU&lt;S otmeevo i . «; , t / :H ir. i Jit'J M? ? ■ ■ s' &amp; i &gt;'- ‘ : 1 *»’ ' x ' iril 4MIM0B . . . .W«i t ,«rt« **•*•# *•*• ••* • a,1 » ^jg aoi£* 3 fc&amp;» It *&amp;* »#i Bati qm iXtrmi tov&amp;n I •&amp; &amp;** ***** 0j 9sU to «b *** v ' - l - 10 ^ is : S ■ ^ ( i 1 V* ? ^&gt; •- ' - ' ' ' ^ ' - : ^ : ■ b io boo^ b »fse 092^ XXIt to 1 ?lro^ s inuev fofxa rfjUBrt* ad# to cloon «i KiorfJ « i»o^e#mooii&gt; t om os ♦ifi wo ^ o« , 0 ^-iX onj Jbii* no Jaoiao vo&gt; it Jug y , iff? v is si oc lo ipvil x* i&gt;9 til B&amp;vl&amp;m&amp;aJ woda tiu &amp;»3 \,fajg 9 iX« # ▼ #** sfciv - ttloloo Xt»«0 ofc 8ia Irtftff Rf&gt; T4 -ibovat 0 ?#q«oo ajso afuuox Xaia»-ii:\ - 195 it! sirf to f: riq«i|^ifiQ XlXoiooqoo gniiuodri^ion sai to aiiJoe ^ Of!t x.X^« Isriollaojjb® biotla bn« tp*' 1 * aa ,t«ri5 - i *lti bX4v - \.ioa? fib iiXiw eoT^o 1 Ja In&amp;toimJ* 9f‘3 ,aio«nir»© c * unit nl boc# no iSBOubB Sen It Bas e?i ^iiiiafcifaaoo si z*Jlup t ' 1 t ®o##X® Xoooi^oo^X# it# nl biov* bt;^. c? ei litiSttBv?* irsonif lot %$nt&gt;bus* Jug an uS lil% sioiti* ,##?# Xxo e« 8 r' #isf£# \ % *D*K lO^iwpof Isf' * 4 * i#Olttf&gt; filMI a^T .nobrsEOvI ‘ 'V ^ Vn &lt; i,. *tliere are no suitable opening*. Having worked in order to acquire an education such youths are naturally disgruntled *fhan they find that this education is apparently of little use to truss, while having been educated they are disinclined to earn their living by manual labour. I am afraid that it will be irfipoaaible to avoid turning out some such disgruntled young men, but at any rate we can try and reduce this number to a minimum by ene oar aging technical education. 4 . The difficulty is that there ,ire no facilities for this technical education in Kuwait, and even if these wer** provided could only be on a very small scale. facilities exist next door in Iraq both for technical as well as for other education, but I entirely agree with de Saury - vide paragraph 6 of his letter - that it is distinctly undesirable that Kuwaiti boys and young men should acquire their education in the subversive and antUBritieh atmosphere of Iraq. On the other hand as Iraq has the great advantage of being so near to Cuwait, it is only 4 hours by c»r from Kuwait to ^asra, I am afraid that it will be impossible to prevent 'u.?aiti youths going there, at all events to finish off tneir education, more especially as the Iraqis are fully alive to the advantage of getting Kuwaiti youths educated in Iraq and have offered them - as pointed out by de Oaury in hia paragraph ^ ^ i 4 - five free vacancies in the Bagdad Training College. Although we may have to resign ourselves to a certain number of Kuwaiti youths finishing their education in Xraq f there is no reason why we should not attempt to make education in Kuwait itself as useful as possible and to try and innoculate the boya with pro-Britian ideas against Iraqi influence# I agree with de Saury « vide his paragraph 12 (c) - that we might try andi 11 ^S| Kilt I Ini, Wji; ? ,i BOiOIi'}|!

A . rV' this subject, and he and Powle seem to us to have made out a strong case for some positive action on our part to supplement the deficiencies of local education and to counteract the subversive influences to which young Koweitis may be exposed when following the natural and almost inevitable tendency to complete their education in Iraq. You will see that Powle is anxious that enquiries should be made as to whether the British Council could see their way to give financial assistance to enable a number of boys to be educated at an institution such as the Victoria College, Alexandria. He further supports the proposal, as to which also de Oaury suggests the advice, and/ Baggallay, Esq. , Foreign Office.aD&amp; if possible the financial assistance, of the British Council should he sought, to secure, with the Sheikh’s agreement, a British schoolmaster for the teaching of English and other educational duties in Koweit.

Education in Kuwait My dear Sir Trenchard, Scott came to see me the other day and, during the course of conversation, the subject of skilled labour in Kuwait arose. 2. Scott said that he thought that very soon the: would he a shortage of masons in Kuwait, and that to overcome that he was considering starting a class to train Kuwaitis in masonry. To continue the good work of this class, it was his desire to obtain the servi ces of an Englishman to hold classes throughout the year in masonry, fitting, carpentry, machine driving etc., each course to last about three months. 3. Scott added that he thought that unless some steps were taken to train Kuwaitis, there would even tually be an outcry that Kuwaitis were not being engaged, and that foreigners were being imported to do work which, in the minds of the ignorant, could equally well be done by Kuwaitis.

My dear Sir Trenchard, Would you please refer to the correspondence ending with my demi-official letter No. 249 of the 9th June, on the subject of Education in Kuwait? Unfortunately his arrival was delayed, and the schools had closed down on the morning of the same day as that on which he arrived. However, everyone was very accommo dating, even the hoys who must have hated it, for the schools were reassembled for Vallance for a few days to give him a chance to carry out the purpose of his visit. favourable. Vallance and I decided on this system of reporting so as not to discourage the Kuwaitis by rubbing in matters which they may not understand, and so discoura ging them from further effort. This seems to have worked well so far, for already the Council have been informed by the Shaikh of what Vallance told him of report *A ', that is to say the gist of the whole report. Of report 'B H the Shaikh has been told nothing. He has been given nothing in writing, and on this score I await your ins true tions. 4. My brief comments are as follows: 2 Vallance duly arrived and stayed a week 3. I enclose two reports which I have and 'B*.

The figure seems to me to he very reasonable and I should like to see the work given to Yallance. I am sure he would do the work conscientiously and well. p“ para. 11, the Shaikh was told of this, and I daresay action will he taken.

The hoys are all sons of the Persian element of the Town, and as such are likely to make better artisans than Arab hoys do. The school receives no income from the Kuwait State, and, beyond having given an initial donation, the Government do not seem to take any interest in the school. The running of it is left to the Shiah Mullahs. I think the school should he left outside our scheme of improvements for we can only concern ourselves with State schools. It is a pity, for the most likely material as regards eventual efficiency in labour will come from the Persian section. By leaving out the Shiahs what we are setting out to do is to change the leopards spots, when we already have leopards with the right coloured spots. However, I don’t see how we can help it. There is a possibi lity that the school may close down soon from lack of funds, when if the hoys are taken into the State school so much the better. Though there is not much likelihood of that for reasons of religious antipathy. V, Yallance’s visit caused a flutter in the Kuwait dove cote and was, I hear, viewed with apprehension from some quarters. I must say Vallance put his hack into his work while/-5* wM1 ® he was here » y et conducted hisjself tactfully. The result was a successful visit. The question of what remunera- tion to asK from the Shaikh remains, would &amp; 35/- he consi dered a reasonable sum? £ 50 /- were suggested for Bahrain, vide Houstoun-Boswall’s letter Ho. 309/12/39 of the 25th May 1939. ' ’ Tours sincerely,R Kuwait, 28 June 1939. Dear Major Galloway, I have now inspected the four Government Schools of Kuwait - the Muharakiyah School in more detail than the others - and I beg to submit a brief report of what I have found. 2^ I can begin by saying that my general impression of the schools of Kuwait is a very pleasant one. There was a happy atmosphere about them all, which is always a good sign. &gt; The buildings in which the schools are housed are fairly satisfactory. They are clean, and in fairly good repair. The quality of the teaching which is given inside the buildings is of course much more important than the quality of the buildings themselves. ^ Much of ^ school equipment, chiefly the desks used by the boys, was in need of renewal or repair, and I was told that this work would be done during the holidays. As regards the Staff, I think the Government has been wise to engage Palestinian teachers, rather than Egyptians, Syrians, or Iraqis, and in my o-’ nion great credit is due to the Palestinian Headmaster for the improve ments which he has effected in Education in Kuwait during the past three years. Most of the assistant masters seemed to be competent men, and I was particularly impressed by the efficiency and enthusiasm of the young Pales tinian master who is in charge of the Boy Scouts. The boys appeared to be well-disciplined, and, on the whole, well- taught. They were bright and intelligent, especially those in the lower classes. They were certainly more healthy than the boys of the Government schools in Bahrain. Their clothes, however, were not so clean. j The higher and middle classes of the schools were of about the right sizes, but the babies* classes were too large, and I shall refer to these lower classes later on in this Report.h&gt;h 106 - 2 - S The standard of education reached at Kuwait is not as high as that reached by some of the other Arab States. There are, in my opinion, a number of ways in which it could be improved, and these I will enumerate. j The first and most important thing to remember when we are trying to educate children is that there can be no sound education without sound physical health. What is most urgently needed in the schools is a School Doctor. By this I do not mean a doctor who would attend to the health of the schools in addition to some other work : I mean one who would work solely among the children. If the Government cannot afford such a doctor, then they should offer a reasonable salary to some doctor who has very little other work to do. It should be the duty of the appointed doctor to visit all the schools every day, and to visit those children who are absent from school owing to illness. He should keep individual records of the health and development of every school child, and make himself person ally responsible for their physical health throughout the whole of their school life. The doctor appointed should be a man specially qualified to treat the diseases of the eye. He should personally lecture to all the children in all the schools on matters of health, and about the necessity of having disease of all kinds treated in its earliest stage, and not left il it is too late ; and the children should be taught that this advice refers especially to eye-diseases. The doctor appointed should be the kind of man who is able to win the confidence of children, so that instead of trying to evade him they will come to him of their own freewill to seek his help. If we wish children to make the proper use of doctors we must educate them in these matters, just as in any other matters, and we must provide them with doctors of whom they will not be frightened. It was pitiful to see in the schools of Kuwait many little boys who have lost or who are losing their eyesight, simply because there was nobody to attend to the trouble in its early stages, or to warn them of the danger of ne glecting disease. Blind and half-blind people are of little value to any State, and I suggest that any money spent now on providing a school doctor in Kuwait would be repaid many times over, in the form of healthier men and women, in the coming years. I consider the provision of a school doctoi7 0 ^ to 136 the most pressing of* all the necessary school reforms# The next thing I ought to mention is the necessity of cultivating in the school-children a proper feeling of patriotism, and l^y this I mean a patriotic feeling for Kuwait, rather than for the Arab world as a whole. I was sorry to find many of the hoys, at all the four schools, using exer cise hooks which bore on their covers the portrait of a foreign Ruler and the name of a ioreign State. This should he absolutely forbidden, and if any portrait is to be placed on the school exercise-books, it should be that of the Sheikh of Kuwait. I was glad to find that there is a National Song, composed by a Kuwaiti, and learnt and sung in the schools : but there is no History of Kuwait in use there, and this defect ought to be remedied at once. A commission should be given to some competent person to write, .or an agreed fee, a school history-book, dealing only with the history of Kuwait, and the smallest boys should be taught the history of Kuwait before they begin to learn any other history : for this reason the book should be written in an extremely simple style, suitable for the lowest classes in the schools. We cannot expect to find the full measure of patriotism in our subjects unless we have taken some steps to foster patriotism in them while they are still children at school. While we are speaking of patriotism I should like to touch upon the question of school clothes. The Headmaster of the four schools tells me rat little by little he is trying to persuade the boys to wear European clothes rather than Arab clothes, and that udien he occasionally gives out free clothes to poor boys at the school he gives them European clothes. I am sure this is a very great mistake. Arab clothes are beautiful and dignified, they have been worn unchanged for many centuries, and they have been found by long experience to be the most suitable clothes for the climates in which the Arabs have to live. The boys of Kuwait should not be taught to despise the costume of their ancestors. On the contrary, they should be taught to respect them, to keep them clean, and to wear them with grace and pride. They need not be afraid that not much will be thought of them unless they dress themselves like Europeans s the English, especially, admire peoples who retain their national costumes and remain proud of them.- 4 - (OY I 2 My next recommendation refers to the education of the Atfal, or infants. In all Eastern countries it seems to he the practice to allot all the best teachers to the oldest hoys and the worst teachers to the beginners. This is the worst mistake that could he made, for the first few years of a child* s education are far more important than any others. It is during these years that he learns neatness, method, correct ways of thinking, application, and so on ; and we invariably find that we cannot teach hoys successfully in the middle and upper classes of a school, or lead them to higher educational levels, unless they possess the sound foundation which is the only basis upon which the higher teaching can he built. In any school the best teachers should always he given to the ^oungest hoys. But I want to recommend in the case of Kuwait something even further than this s I want to recommend that no babies* classes should any longer he carried on in any of the existing schools (which contain ) boys of 18 and even 20 years of age), hut that a special Preparatory School should he created, and that all children who are receiving their first three years of education should he sent to this school and to no other. And it is of the utmost importance that only the best-qualified and best and most patient of the teachers should he allowed to teach in this school, which should he the best-equipped, and which should be considered the most important, of all the schools in the State. If this suggestion is carried out, the result will he, in a few years’ time, a very marked improvement in the educational standards of all the classes in the other schools ; and Government J ^ . f&gt;1 _ if the Kuwait really wishes to improve the standard of educati State, it will best and most quickly he able to do so by starting at the bottom of the educational system, and not at the top. I The next two suggestions refer to the teaching of Arithmetic an' English, and they are made in view of the fact that before very long the Oil Company is likely to have a number of well-paid posts to offer to hoys and young men who are of sufficient educational standard The standard of Arithmetic possessed by the Kuwait schoolboys - or as Government or enough to make them of much value to the Oil ^ P i n the near future, we business clerks. If the standard is not impshall see all the hetter-paid posts going to foreigners&gt; instead of to local men, and this will lead to dissatisfaction and grievances on the part of the State’s subjects, as it has done in the past in Bahrain and other places. The Government would be wise to obtain immediately the services of a really good teacher of Mathematics, and to put him in charge of all the mathematical teaching at all the schools - that is to say, to put all the other Arithmetic teachers under his orders, and to give him definite instructions to raise the whole standard of Arithmetic in the schools by introducing modern methods of teaching, and by personally supervising the work. This teacher should as soon as he arrives get into touch with Major Galloway &amp;c«.U, -the $4-1 *Se«pany, with a view to finding out from him exactly what is required by the Cpmpany in the way of Mathematics. 14 ^ The teaching of English in the Mubarakiyah School is good and sound as far as it goes, but it does not go very far. The boys have a good know ledge of the language within the narrow limits of the simple text-books which they are using, but nothing more ; and this is not enough for an oil company’s requirements. The best thing to do would be to employ a compet ent Englishman to teach the top classes ; but if this cannot be afforded the existing masters should be urged to take their boys to much higher levels than those at which they are now studying. \ $ I must draw the attention of the Government to the question of the handwriting of the boys in the government schools. The handwriting, both in Arabic and in English, but especially in English, is bad ; and this is a pity, because for centuries it has been an Arabic tradition to write beautifully, and by English people bad handwriting is considered to be a sign of low culture and low education. This means that an Arab boy who writes badly will never be able to fill a post as a Government, Bank, or business clerk, which is the object of many of the boys in the Kuwait schools. The reason for the bad handwriting is that in teaching writing the schools do not make use of copy-books s the boys learn to write by the method of copying what their teachers have written on the blackboard, or by imitating the letters in printed books. This is all wro g. reborn mend that all the lower classes in all the schools should learn to writes [(O ■&lt;r Arabic from proper copy-books, and that all the English classes should have regular practice in handwriting from English copy-books. I have already told the Headmaster which are the best English copy-books to use, and as for the Arabic ones, as there are now many different styles of Arabic handwriting represented in the available copy-hooks, I suggest that a number of specimens be shewn to the Sheikh, and that he should decide which style of Arabic handwriting is traditional in Kuwait, or best suited to the needs of the Kuwait boys. The teachers who are selected by the Headmaster to teach handwriting to the infants should be specially and very carefully selected from men who are themselves good at handwriting and at freehand drawing. (There is another cause of the bad handwriting in the schools. This is the use of pencils instead of ink. I recommend that all the boys should be accustomed to the use of ink from an early age, and that after they leave the lower classes they should never be allowed to use pencils at all. Writing with pencils in unknown in English schools. fy I should like to mention the question of regular attendance on the part of the boys at the schools. We cannot properly educate boys if their attendance is spasmodic or irregular. I recommend that each of the schools should employ a special farash who would act as an attendance officer, and who would make it his duty each day to know the true cause of absence of every boy who has been marked absent on the attendance roll. I do«not think that the average parent would resent the visits of such a man to thei] houses for this purpose, for it very often happens that the parent is quite unaware that his son is absenting himself from school, and is grateful for being told about it. In any case,we should always consider the efficiency of the schools before the feelings of the parents. t A few words about the Mubarakiyah School. There is a tendency to look upon this school as being much more important than the others, simply because the Mubarakiyah a few classes of higher standard tnan are providei A at the other three schools. The result of this view of the Mubarakiyah is that the other schools are to some extent neglected. For example, there is not a single Palestinian teacher in any of the schools except the Mubar7 - X - /'/ ;© akiya^i, and eTery one of the 100 Boy Scouts which, haye been enrolled is a Mubarakiyah boy. This discrimination between the schools is 3 - great mistake&gt; and if it is allowed to continue it will destroy the corporate feeling which ought to exist between all the Government schools. The three smaller schools should be regarded as the feeders of the larger one* and therefore as being equally important ; and the teaching thep# at the smaller scnools should most certainly be just as good as that provided in the Mubarakiyah. tW ^ that there is much the same kind of discrimination between the Palestinian and the Kuwaiti teachers, in the matter of salaries. In opinion the salaries of the Kuwaitis are too far below those of the Palestinians, even if we remember that the Palestinians have their travell ing expenses to provide for, and that their cost of living (at Kuwait) is higher than that of the local men. I think it would be fair to make some small increase in salary for the benefit of the local teachers. 'Z'Q jjf i also feel that the salary of the Headmaster is too low, -when we consider that he is responsible for all the activities of all the four schools, and that he has in three years effected a tremendous improve*e*t in the educational affairs of Kuwait. Perhaps the Government might see their way towards recognising financially the Headmaster’s past services. I think it would be wise on the part of the Government, when engaging new teachers, to engage men who have received all their education in Palestine, at Government schools, and who have not served as teachers in any countries outside of Palestine. The Government schools of Palestine are well conducted, on English lines, and we should try in Kuwait to get the benefit of this, by engaging masters who have known no other systems of education. ■ % \ 1 Finally, as regards political activities in the schools. Education has nothing to do with politics, and it is not desirable that either school boys or schoolmasters should concern themselves with political matters* Warnings should be given from time to time in the schools that any polit ioal activities on the part of either masters or hoys will lead to expul-- 8 - \ li) ^ The above are my recommendations for the well.be ing, improvement, and future success of Government education in Kuwait s but I ought to add that while visiting the schools I noticed many minor deficiencies which the Head master told me had formed the subject of repeated applications by himself to the authorities, without result# These minor deficiencies, though not sufficiently important in themselves for inclusion in this report, when added together form a sum-total which seriously interferes with the full efficiency of the schools ; and I therefore think that it would be wise to ask the Sheikh to issue his personal order to those responsible for the upkeep of the school buildings and property that reasonable applications by the Head- receive master concerning school matters should fcw prompt** attention. A ,4^ Having now finished my description of the things which I have seen in Kuwait, I may perhaps be excused if I say a few words about something which I have not seen, but which will shortly have to be provided if Kuwait is to become one of the centres of the oil industry. I mean Technical Education. There is at present nothing of the kind at Kuwait, and those boys who wish eventually to obtain technical posts with the Oil Company ought to be beginning their technical training now. I do not know what are the intentions of the Govern ment in this matter, but the building and equipment of even a small technical school is an expensive matter, and I do not know whether it can be afforded or not, a? hiwait^ If not, I suggest that the Bahrain Government be approached, very soon, for permission to send a small number of carefully selected Kuwaiti boys to the Bahrain Government Technical School. Application might also be successfully made to the Oil Company for financial helf in this matter. I have seen the Bahrain Technical School at work, and was very favourably im pressed by it. It is under the control of an Englishman, and has an atmos- phere of work and efficiency which would provide an excellent preliminary training for young Kuwaitis who wish later on to enter the Oil Company 1 s employ. You will remember that in the discussion which we had with Scott about employment with the Company he stressed the absolute necessity of a high standard of working discipline amongst the youthful employees. But the most important thing to remember is that technical education takes time, and that therefore we should make a start with the training of the boys now, and not wait until after the Company has begun to produce oil, when it will be too late.kV I think I have now said all that I can usefully say about the education here, and it only remains for me to thank the P.R., through yourself, for having asked me to undertake the work, to say what a pleasure it has been uo do it, and to thank both him and yourself for the great hospitality you have shewn me throughout my stay in Kuwait. Believe me, Yours sincerely, • • •Kuwai 1 9 29 June 1939. Dear Galloway, We agreed that I should write, for private use, a applementary note to the Report on Education which I have just submitted, ie purpose of the Note being to enable me to give you any useful inform- tion which it would not be tactful to convey to the Sheikh, for fear of imping his genuine enthusiasm for education, or too harshly disappointing belief that the standard here is a high one. 2 ^ Most fortunately, all the nice things which I have said in the Report have been able to say quite honestly. These people really are trying to it up a good show in education, and they really do believe that their tandard is high. This of course is an illusion. The Arab simply does not salise how low his educational standards are, ana it Is only when those tandards come up against an acid test (in this case the very modest w- ithematical requirements of the oil company) that the real truth is sus- scted. ^ Perhaps I could best sum up the educational situation in Kuwait by -ying that while the existing state of affairs is very creditable to the resent Palestinian management, it would be highly discreditable to any iglishman who might be occupying the same position. * The Pinal Examinations just held here are a good example of what is 3ing on, I saw some of the question-papers, and they were set on the BUal childish Eastern method, which ensures that the candidates will pass, ren if they know next to nothing. The marking of the papers done by the tys was on the same plan. ''S What is really wanted here, of course, is a British director or inspec of education who really knows his job. Under such a man the present w, plus one or two replacements or newcomers, would be good enough, ana 16 standard could be raised considerably. The only thing wanted is a bit : British drive, to counteract Arab inertia.- 2 - I n view of the wealth that is coming, and the changes which that wealt] ill tiring, I should advise you to get an Englishman if you can ; for there s bound to be a great increase in the number of schoolchildren as soon as he money- flow begins&gt; and then there will be a greater muddle than ever in he schools. As far as one can reasonably calculate only about one child n six is being educated at present. rrangement, or gentleman’s agreement* with the Oil Company, under the term f which they would refuse to employ any young Kuwaiti of school age unless e could produce either a Government certificate of sufficient education, - a certificate that he^ean never reach any higher standard than his xisting one, and could therefore be employed immediately. Belgrave and tried this at Bahrain, and a little to my surprise the oil company agreed t once. The only 'snag' to such an arrangement, unless you have a British irector of education, is that the certificates of sufficient education ill be given (under pressure, influence, etc.) to boys who don’t deserve hem. Things would not be too bad here, really, if it were not for the fact hat the oil is coming. That will raise many new problems, amongst which ducation is sure to figure prominently. Ik ; I think this is all I can usefully add to the Report, which is of ourse composed in a very simple style, with a view to its translation into rabic. Another thing which you ought to try to do fairly soon is to an could Yours, etc.Confidential# 1 D,Q* Ho. 0/274. Political Agency, Kuwait, 10th July, 1939. My dear Sir Trenchard, inference your demi-official letter Ho# 562-S or the 14th June, 1939, on the subject of Technical Education at Kuwait# 2# I must admit that before I had discussed with Scott and Yallance Technical Education, I had but a very hazy idea of what the term meant when reduced to hard facts. It appears that the term Technical Education includes three separate degrees of training. I hope I am not being redundant, but it is necessary to be clear. The first is (a) the academic meaning of Technical Educa tion, i.e. the combination of theory and practice, then (b) can be conveniently classed as the preparation of Artisans and (c) the preparation of skilled labour. 3. Neither Scott as the potential employer, nor Yallance as the educational expert thinks that there would be any value to Kuwait in pursuing (a) yet. The Shaikh told me that there were four boys whom he would like to send to a Technical College in Egypt to be trained as teachers. He promised to write to me on the subject but has not done so, and, as Yallance told me that any movement in that direction would be abortive owing to the lo# standard of education here, I have not reopened the subject 4. The pursuit of (b) we think is probably most likely/ Hon'ble Sir Trenchard Eowle, KCIE., OKS., Political [Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire#likely to produce permanent tangible results in Kuwait, “but Scott thinks that to act in that direction at the moment is early. To set up an establishment to teach artisan apprentices is a costly affair, and a scheme could not be settled on before the Kuwait Oil prospects are more definite* Vallance is of the opinion that the standard of education of the boys in the Kuwaiti Schools is too low at the age required - the boys have to be caught young, about 14 - to warrant a start on (b), though with efficient supervision, the material, both in masters and pupils, is present. I suggest, therefore, that (b) cannot be started upon until the educational standard has been raised, by which time the Kuwait Oil Company will perhaps be ready to cooperate* 5 # The instruction that Scott was considering comes under category (c), and it is in that category that preli minary steps might be tak^n now* I conveyed your message (paragraph 3 of your'iemi-official letter under reply) to Scott, and he was glad that you saw eye to eye with hla in this matter. It is possible that his principals in London may hedge a little, but it is early days yet. Vallance suggested that Kuwaiti hoys should he sent to the Technical School at Bahrain, and trained there. The Bahrain School is actually an apprentice training shop. Vailance was very keen on this, and Soott seemed auite to like the idea too as a temporary measure. The hoys who would enter such a shop must perforce he poor, and to send them to Bahrain would prove a heavy liahility in the way of travel, living, pocket money expenses etc., and I do not think that the Kuwait State would he willing to shoulder this liaoility, though it is possible that the Kuwait Oil Company might. 7. So that something practical will emerge quickly,-3 I siiggest that I he allowed to write to Scott proposing that the Kuwait Oil Company contribute two scholarships for Kuwait Arab artisan hoys at the Bahrain Technical School this autumn. The hoys should he selected hy the Company in consultation with me. If you agree, while I am putting out a feeler to Scott, perhaps the views of the Bahrain Government could he obtained. I do not know how the Shaikh would react to such a proposal, hut I think not too unfavourably. If made, it should he an incentive to him to speed up educational improvements.

I shall return to the charge later. 3. With regard to paragraph 3, Sir Trenchard seems to have got the idea that I suggested the dropping of the idea of a technical class in Kuwait in favour of sending two boys to Bahrain. I did not suggest this at all. What i/y I suggested was, briefly, (c.f. paragraph 5 of my D.O.No. 0/274 of the 10th July, 1939), that preliminary steps might be taken now in regard to the preparation of skilled labour, and, so that something tangible and progressive might be done this autumn, (to obtain sanction and put up buildings, collect tools, plants, instructor etc. requires time), I suggested that we might sound the Kuwait Oil Company as to whether they would finance two scholarships to Bahrain, Please forgive me this repetition, but it seems necessary in the circumstances. 4 ^ Scott put his original idea to his Board oi Direc tors.

I spoke to the Shaikh concerning the necessity of a history of Kuwait for the schools here* ani suggested that Vallanc© might be commissioned to undertake the task. I told the Shaikh that the cost to him would be £ 100/- plus the cost of printing. The Shaikh did not see how Vallance was qualified for the task so I pointed out that Yallance was suggested as he could be given access to records, and, being an educational man, could reproduce the material in a form palatable to students. I tho Shaikh did not like the idea of paying out £ 100, but he said that he would consider the matter in conjunction with his educational department.. I conjecture that if he is asked later, he will say that he is arranging a. or an history to be written by his Director of Education. 3.

Cap© Ccmorin in the east and *U&amp;an in the west, provided we give hi&amp; innate cause* This we do not do at present. £.

If, when these men talk, they apeak in praise of the British Indue ad by something we have den# for them, they will become splendid disciples, and at the came time* since something will have been incul cated into their beings, (that is, if my proposals are followed), they would be better equipped tc -withstand adverse propaganda than they would otherwise have been. I do not suggest that these men should be taught actually to spread propaganda, but simply that they should be able to do so naturally and unconsciously. 4* This could, I believe, be brought about by benefits being conferred or the sailors end their families in Kuwait. These men are mostly married, and they are ateady men. But they are poor men, and while they arc away their wives and children are left almost uncared for.

Dear Gallov/ay, Please excuse this letter being typewritten : I have only this thin paper handy, and it is not very suitable for ink. Thanks very much for your letter. I only hope the permission from India, and the British Council adjustments, will not take very long. I very anxious indeed to get started at Bahrain, and of course the term has already begun. Thanks for sending me a copy of the proposed Contract. I think this is in most respects extremely generous, but there are one or two minor points which I should like to discuss, and I should therefore be glad if you would kindly let me know whether they should be discussed with you or with Belgrave. The chief one is in connection with the date of commence ment of the Contract. I very much hope that this can be considered as ' e ing October 1 st, for if not, I shall lose about £75. As I think you know, I was engaged by the Ministry of economics and Communications here to teach Bnglish at the engineering School, at £50 a month, resident, A. 0e ginning on October 1st. On September 29th your letter reached the wibas; ■y, and fill I got it the next morning. one sentence read :you please let me have a telegram saying whether you are willing to accept the post or not ?'’ , and as you asked roe to get the Embassy to reply in code, and added : ‘Please also say from what date you will be available”, I assumed that the matter was urgent and immediate, and therefore got my self released from the other engagement, and they wired to England for another man in my place. The same day I asked the embassy to wire you that I accepted, and that I could come immediately. As you know, it then turned out, through no fault of mine, that there was to be a delay, which is still continuing. Had I known that this would have been so, I could have taken on the other job temporarily, and by the middle of this month j- should have earned £75, as well as having had free boaxd at the school, -lease don T t .think I am complaining : I only want to put the facts before you, and to ask that the date of commencement should be counted as October 1st, the date on which I accepted the post which was then contemplated. Anyway, I should be most grateful if you would let me know to whom I should write, about small details in connection with the Contract, or 'hether it would be best to wait until I get to Bahrain. You say in your letter that the Contract is not in its final form. Thanks once again for any part you have had in getting me this very tractive job, which I am looking forward to immensely.Confidential Political Agency, Kuwait, 15th November, 1939 j D.O, No. 0/383 My dear Colonel, /ith reference to your letter No. 0/628 of the 23rd October, 1939, I enclose a copy of a letter I have received from Vallance, and should 'be grateful if you could let me know how I should reply. 3. ^allance told me when I saw him in Baghdad that he was walking to the Baghdad Engineering school, having made up his mind to accept a post that had 'been offered him, 'but that on the way he called in at the Embassy, (as he had heard previously from them), and having read my letter decided to turn down the ahovementioned offer. t He explained that it was fortunate that he had received my letter when he did, or he would not have 'b en aval- la ole for the work we are offering him. It will 'be seen that Vallance now writes in direct contradiction of what he told me. I did of course ask Vallance to reply hy telegram, 'but that was to avoid any unnecessary delay. The request did not obviously in any way make a promise of employment from the date of Vallance *s turning down of the employment. However, as Vallance did turn down work on receipt of our tentative offer, a speedy settlement seems to 'be called for in fairness to him.

The course lasts for two years, two terms of 11 ironohs, the fee is Es 3G/~ per month, ds. 330/- per annum, not including board and lodging. Both carpentry and mechanics are taught in the school, for the latter a knowledge of English and mathematics is essen tial. Should the two students wish to come to Bahrain I should be obliged if they would state beforehand which sub ject they wish to learn; the school building is being en- larged and we shall shortly have room for four more mechanic students and several carpenters, but there is considerable competition for entering the school. Students should be healthy, with good eyesight and between the ages of 15 - 20. 2. I enclose a letter from the State Engineer describing the work of the school. Boys who complete the courses are in uhe case of carpenters, sure of obtaining well paid emp loyment, as an example of chis three ex students have been taken on by the California Arabian Standard Oil Company at Hs. 3/- a day and in the case of mechanics I think it can be said that they are sure of obtaining employment with an oil company. The mechanics class has not been in existence as long as the carpentry class and none of the boys has finished the whole course.gOVERNKSNT OF RAWratm STAT3 BNGIHBER'S OEPA'RTMBWT' No. AGB/25/58 Bahrain, 28th October, 1939, The Adviser, The Government of Bahrain, Bahrain. Mfemorandom government Technical School Y/ith reference to your memorandum No. 1743/2-E of 1358 enclosing a copy of a letter from the Political Agent in connedtion with the Government Technical School. I enclose an extract from the Government of Bahrain Annual Report for 1357, which explains the general position, and the ground the school covers. The object of the school at present is to train Bahrain boys as mechanics, and artisan carpenters. Provided a student is normally intelligent, he, at the completion of his training, will be qualified v for employment as a carpenter or mechanic with an oil com pany or any other Industrial concern. At the end of the present month one boy is proceeding to the workshops of the Bahrain Petroleum Company for six months training, during which time he will receive Rs 2/- per day. At the end of six months, if satisfactory, he will be given permanent employment with the Company. Other students will go to the Bahrain Petroleum Company *3 workshops for similar training after the expiration of their term of eighteen months in the Government workshops. Several carpentry students, who have completed their two years course, have been given employment in various Government departments and are doing well. The school is under my direct supervision, and I personally examine the boys during, and at the termination of their instruction period.School Staff The staff consists of : One working instructor mechanic Two working instructor carpenters These instructors were obtained from Syria. English is also taught by a local Arab teacher for one hour each day. School Equipment The school equipment consists of One shearing machine One sawing machine One drilling machine One wood lathe Two grind stones Two emery wheels A complete blacksmiths outfit Bench tools etc for six students. One electric welding plant One pipe screwing machine One 6 rt (Power) Lathe and the usual other small equipment of a mechanical workshop. The school premises are at present being enlarged, after which four more engineering students can be taken. This scheme of technical e ducation is still in its very early stages and, as time goes on, it is hoped that a larger and more comprehensive syllabus of training will be adopted. Students who show good progress could, possibly, be sent to such institutions as the City and Guilds College in London, where they could qualify for more highly paid executive posts, in this state or abroad. This may sound somewhat ambitious, but I see no reason why (although the process would be necessarily slow) such an aim should not be obtained. One important point, however, is that the standard preliminary e ducation in the ordinary State schools should be improved /-V -3- improvedj particularly in the later stages of the boy school life, They should leave school with a good working knowledge of English| and practical mathematics* and perhaps* even be given some elementary science etc. This would prepare them for their training as constructive members of the community. I should like to emphasize the necessity of learning English, as most of the students who qualify will find emp loyment in the local Oil Company, or in one or another of the other companies in the Persian Gulf, where English would be a necessity.
