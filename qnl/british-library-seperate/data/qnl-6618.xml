Internal Conditions;conditions in neutral territories;military information;economic warfare;evasions of censorship;hostile Arab agents.The information on each subject is largely drawn from intercepted correspondence, and excerpts are quoted or paraphrased throughout as evidence. It is noted at the beginning of the file that the information contained within aims to give an idea of what 'the people, as distinct from the government, are thinking'.There are five attached appendices labelled A-E (folios 8-18). Appendices A, B, D and E are translations of intercepted letters which have previously been quoted. Appendix C is a report from the Deputy Chief Postal Censor which provides a general outline of European opinion on the Second World War based upon information read in intercepted correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Middle East Intelligence Centre</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Second World War (1939-1945)</topic></subject><subject><topic>International relations</topic></subject><subject><topic>Public opinion</topic></subject><subject><topic>Censorship</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000466.0x0002c3#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000466.0x0002c3#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000466.0x0002c3#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
