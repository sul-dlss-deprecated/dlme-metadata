Copy of a latter 3 o_ 4100/A/74 dated/the 13th January 1238, from His Britannic Majesty'*s Consul-General^^fl^asan,/ to the Secretary to,the Government of India^in the ^ Fill PCT,ai3 ( External Affairs Depa tment, New Delhi Subject:- Travelling allowances on annual i moves between Meshed and Zabul. I have the honour to refer to the Foreign and Political Department letter No*F*331/^/32, dated the 9th September 1933 sanctioning the amalgamation of the Sistan and Meshed Consulates and directing inter alia that Sistan and Meshed should be the Winter and Summer headquarters respectively. 2. This order is in conflict with various other orders and the present situation which is anomalous is as follows:- (i) The Consul-General himself is admitted to have two headquarters Meshed and Zabul. (ii) The Medical Officer recently appointed has l/u ENCLOSURE IN j 1KDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY’S Letter No. 3 &gt; , Dated 28 P' Received 3 f iAT ' J his headquarter^'Meshed only. (iii) As regards the Extra Assistant and Attache S the situation is not clear vide paragraph 3 b(ii) below. (IV) Of the clerical establishment two have their Headquarters at Meshed and two at Zabul. Actually one clerk remains permanently at each place and the other two move with Headquarters. Actually Meshed is the principal headquarters as the Consul - General and his staff reside there for the greater part of the year and only move with the minimum furnit ure and office equipment to Sistan for the four Winter months. 3. The present situation has given rise to difficulties with the Accountant-General, Central Revenues in the matter of travelling allowance both on first appointments and on the annual.........annual move to Zabul, e.g., (a) An officer joining for the first time via India or returning from leave in India when headquarters is at Zabul is only allowed travelling allowance to that place and has subsequently to transport his family and heavy luggage to Meshed at his own expense* This is manifestly 3amx±xxai2±Hx inequitable. (b) On the annual move to Zabul, travelling allowance is drawn at tour rates only but the drawing of 10 days 1 halting allowance which would be admissible under Supplementary Rule 73a&amp; is inadmissible in the case of two headquarters under Supplementary Rule 70 though the expenseaif of the journey itself is far more than that of an ordinary tour* Thus the following situation arises for the various officers mentioned in paragraph 2 above (i) The Consul General himself does not draw any halting allowance though in view of the fact that the allowances attached to the post have recently been considerably reduced it is submitted that he should now be allowed to do so in the same way as the Consul at Kerman is understood to do on his annual moves to Bandar Abbas. (In this connection a reference is invited to the last sub-paragraph under heading C•1• Pay of Officers in my predecessor’s letter No. 1447/A/74 of the 24th November 1932. (ii) The Medical Officer having his headquarters at Meshed draws the 10 days’ halting allowance under the rules. (iii) The Extra Assistant and Attache have in the past £ drawn the allowance but last year the Attache was prevented from drawing it by the Accountant-General, Central Revenues on the ground that he also, like the Consul-General on the strength of the letter quoted in paragraph one above, has two headquarters. The Accountant General, Central Revenues has hitherto accepted the authorityauthority of the Foreign and Political Department memorandum No*F*154-E*32 of the 15th February 1933 which defined his headquarters as Meshed only. (iv) Of the twok on-gazetted members of the staff who generally move with the Consul-Genera}., the one whose headquarters iaxfc is at Meshed draws halting allowance at Zabul and the other with headquarters at Zabul draws it on his return to Meshed. This though absurd has so far not been dis allowed by the Accountant-General, Central Revenues though he would presumably be correct in doing so. 4. Travelling by road in East Iran has become even more expensive than fonnarly and though the heavy expenditure entailed has in part been recognised by the granting of a small compensatory allowance of Rs.150/- for each journey to the Attache and Confidential Assistant, in connection with the move (vide sub^paragraph ^f) of Foreign and Political Department letter No.F.331-N/32, dated the 9th September 1933) this allowance does little more than cover the cost of the hire - of a car. The pressnt hire of a private Bar varies from Rials 1800 to 2400 (Rs. 300 to 400) and as the mileage Allowance admissible to these Officers for the transport of themselves and their families between Meshed and Zabul come to Rupees 209 only, it will be realised that the grant is quite ix inadequate to cover in any way the cost of luggage and the many incidental expenses inevitably connected with a move of this nature. The clerical establishment will be even ®srx worse off if they are no longer allowed a 10 days' halting allowance at either place. I have referred the question of the applicability of the existing Fundamental and Supplementary ru ies to the Accountant-General, Central Revenues, who is of the opinion that the case is one for the application of special rules as in the case of Government servants moving to the sumner headquarters of a Government. As, however, special rules on; on the lines of Section I of the Simla Allowances Code would be most expensive to Government I am reluctant to put up such proposals even though they would be justified by present conditions* 5. The difficulties of the matter of first appointment will be removed and those of the annual Zabul move to some extent mitigated if, for the purposes of travelling allowance, the headquarters of this Consulate-General could be declared to be Meshed only, and I would request that this may now be done^with retrospective effect to cover the recent move of this headquarters in December 1937. No additional grant will be required. If it is saamto considered that the Consul-General should himself be excluded from the concession the declaration suggested may be made in respect of his staff only* 6. There remains the Kg minor question of the one clerk who remains throughout the year at Zabul; but presumably it would still be open to me under Serial No.19 of Appendix 13 to the Fundamental and Supplementary Rules (Posts and Telegraph!® Compilation Volume II) to declare his headquarters as Zabul. i t might perhaps be ag argued that this authority empowers me now to pass the necessary orders for the Attache as well as for all the clerical establishment but in view of the Government of India orders quoted in paragraph one above and the Accountant-General, Central Revenues’ recent ruling in the matfSx matter of the Attache this appears to me to be hardly proper.f #. v } /K.

In continuation of my letter Bo.207/S/l, d.ated. the 12th Pehruary 1934, forwarding a statement of strength and scales of pay and allowances of non- gazetted establishment of the amalgamated Consulate of Khorasan, I have the honour to submit for the sympathetic consideration of Government that, the ’’Compensatory Allowance u of Rs.50/- and Rs.25/- per mensem granted to the Superintendent and the first clerp. ,3LeshoXi, respect ively, sanctioned in Government oi India, foreign and Political Department memorandum Mo. P.99 (13)-D/30, dated the 26th March 1951, in lieu of ’’Special pay rt as sanctioned for the clerks of the epual grade in Sistan and the Persian Gulf, should now he classed as **Special pay”. 2. The following points may serve to elucidate the Justification of this proposal (a) Owing to the amalgamation of Sis tan and Khorasan, one of the tv/o above mentioned clerks moves with the Headquarters to Sis tan, during winter and one remains at Meshad. The clerks in Sistan draw special pay as elsewhere in the Persian Gulf cadre.(■bJoThe clerk who remains at re shad is moreover, very hard worked. In addition to normal duties as Vice-Consul f s clerk there is now a very great deal of passport work. When in my predecessor’s time the staff at Me shad was reduced, this heavy passport work did not exist. It has arisen as a result of the withdrawal hy the Persians of the oan on the pilgrimage and is likely to continue to he ah normally heavy for 2 or 5 years. (c) .The clerk who moves with Headq.uarters annually draws travelling allowance at tour rates only, although the move for 6 months is practically a transfer, and the recently reduced rates of travelling allowance are insufficient to cover all the expenses of such a move. (d) .Since the amalgamation of the Xhorasan and Sis tan staff with the Gulf cadre, every clerk with the exception of these two draws ‘•Special pay*. If these tvn&gt; posts alone do not enjoy this allowance it will often he difficult to find clerks of the same grade who will he willing to he transferred to Khorasan, thus forf(jibing “Special pay* which counts for leave and pension, and drawing “Compensatory allowance* only, which is not drawn on leave and does not count for pension. 3 # Both for the sake of uniformity throughout the cadre, and of equity, I heg to recommend that these allowances - Bupees 50/- to the Superintendent and Bupees 25/- to the first clerk, he classified as “Special pay“. The/ • f S ** /The only possible argument for these not being so classified, might he that the climate at Meshad is not generally considered so unhealthy as Sis tan or the Gulf* I think this is very much a matter of opinion. The winter in lies had is extremely severe and, particularly for Indians, can hy no means he considered healthy, actually I have found that there is more sickness among the staff in general at Meshad than at Sistan. The Persians themselves regard Meshad as one ol ohe most unhealthy places in Persia, it being a very large and filthy town, the inhabitants constantly suffering from epedemics brought in by the thousands of pilgrims. In addition the cost of fuel has become very expensive indeed of recent years and the general cost of living at Meshad is higher than at 8 is tan or in the Gulf.i i I'rom - The Additional Deputy Secretary to the Govenuaent of India in the Itorelgn and Political Department) To - His Britannic Majesty** Consul General for Khorasan.

Hie requirements of the case could in that case be met by transferring the Bander Abbas Head Clerk to Kerman and the question of the abolition of the Lower Division appointment at Kerman would there fore, not arise since tne present lower division clerk will take tne place of the junior clerk to accompany the Consul on tour.

Conversion ofthe post of Lower division Clerk at Kerman into that of an Upper Division. I have the honour to refer to Captain Burnetts memorandum llo .D. 2020-!B]/33f dated the 30th June 1933, and to say that some misconception seems to have arisen from the terms (Head Clerk, Clerk, Junior Clerk) used in paragraph 37 of the late Colonel Barrett’s letter No. 325/ 127/10 dated the 30th March 1932, regarding the revised establishment for the Consulates at Kerman and Bandar f Abbas. 2. Moreover, I find it difficult to follow the calculations in the Appendices D and E, but the sum of Rs.7440/-, which is proposed in .appendix E under the head C. 2. Pay of Establishment Clerks at^erman approxi mately covers the pay of one Special Grade Munshi, one Upper division Clerk (Head ^lerk ) and one Lower Division Clerk. No provision appears to have been made in these Appendices for clerical establishment in Bandar ’Abbas except that the reductions under this head proposed in Appendix D are very small. 3. In paragraph 37 of his letter the late Colonel Barrett uses the word ’’Clerk’’ when writing of Bandar Abbas, but there is no doubt that he meant an Upper Division Clerk, as he writes just above of a Junior Clerk. It is probable that he did not describe the Clerk at Bandar- ’Abbas as Head Clerk because there was only to be one Clerk, and the term would, therefore,(except for certain Purely local reasons) be unnecessary. This view is borne out. •(gy out by certain informal correspondence which took place at the time with the Consul, Bandar ’Abbas, from uhich it is clear that the intention was that there should be at Kerman (a) One Special Grade Munshi (b) ,An Upper division Clerk(Head Clerk) (c) A Lower Division Clerk (to accompany the Consul, when he goes to Bandar ’-abbas) and at Bandar ’Abba s:- (a) *n Upper division ^lerk (b) A Lower Division Munshi. 4 . jt is clearly most undesirable, if not impossible, to leave the office at Bandar ’Abbas in charge of a Lower Division Clerk in view of the long absences of the Consul, Kerman, at Kerman(and the same applies to Kerman in its turn) and of the necessity for having at Bandar ’Abbas a man of some standing, who will be able to transact ordinary business informally with the Persian authorities. I would retain the name 'Head Clerk' for the reasons that the local Persian authorities are doing their best to belittle (as has been reported separately to the Government of India) our consular arrangements at Bandar ’Abbas, and I think that we should avoid giving them an handle for-&amp;- saying that we have ourselves reduced the Head Clerk’s status. This question of a name may seem a petty point,but is far from being so in the atmosphere of a place like Bandar ’Abbas. 5. I trust that in the light of this explanation trie Government of India will be pleased to sanction the creation of an Upper Division post of Head Clerk Kerman and the abolition of the Lower division post of Second Clerk Bandar ’Abbas with effect from the 19th iipril 1933.Copy of memorQ-nduin No,D. 3527-1^/33 dated New Delhi the 20th October 1933,from the additional Deputy Secretary to the Government of India, in the foreign and Political department ,to the Hon*ble the Resident in the Persian Gulf * Abolition of the Lower Division clerks post at Bandar Abbas and creation of a post of Head clerk, Kerman.

At the saine time the Consul General will in fact spend quite half the year at Zabul and the major and most important part of his work will arise from matters concerning Sistan and Zahedan. This being so, we have felt that it will be convenient to adopt, for everyday purposes, some ZjlxXIlb. title wnich will describe him adequately wherever he may be, and the title that seems to us the best is ’’Sast Persia”* 3. We have already adopted a special “njast Persia*' series of numbers for despatches and telegrams, which will run consecutively throughout the year, wherever the Consul General nay be, 'Meshed' and 'sistan' numbers being reserved for direct communication with these two posts ads when the Consul General is at his other headquarters; this direct -o communication will ordinarily only take place in exceptional circumstances* Galy has been asked to adopt the same system in numbering his despatches and telegrams to us. 4* Similarly, we propose in future to address despatches to His Majesty's Consul General for East Persia, and when copies of despatches are sent to him to say in the distribution paragraph 'I have sent a copy of this despatch ' to His Majesty’s Consul General for East Persia (at Meshed)* 1 orwi 11 T-l or M (at sistan) M as the cage ’nay be.

In practice, oi course, all concerrjed will know where the Consul General is at any given time of the year. 5.

BRITISH L.33ATI0H* Gulhek. September 23rd, 1933. Dear Fraser-Tytier, May I invite your attention to sub-paragraph ( b) of your despatch Ho. F.33.L-N/32 of September 4th to the Consul for Si star* and Kain regarding the amalgamation of that post with Meshed. quite frankly, the designation of the new combined post laid down therein ( rt Consu^. j-eneral f^r Si at an and Kainand Agent of (? to) the Governor General in Khora ssan M ) seems to me impossible. In tne first place sistan and Kain are subordinate divisions of the Province of Khorassan. More over they do not even as it is, I believe, cover tne whole f of the area which the Consul at ga oul in fact administers. Secondly, I can see no advantage in saying that the Consul General is Consul General for one part of his district and Agent to the Governor General for another pa rt. He is in fact and practice Consul General for the whole and it is much better to call him so. Thirdly, I see considerable objection to the use of the phrase 'Agent to the Governor General', especially if it is to be used alone and not merely as an appendix to the title of Consul General, as hitnerto. I am not quite sure of the origin of the title 'Agent to the Governor General in Khora ssan' • I believe it was given in order that the Consul Generax might have the personal precedence of a second class Resident or something of that kind. I should be the last person in the world to wish to deprive Daly of any such precedence, but I should much prefer that he should have itOS) it without the use of a title to which the Persian Government would take the strongest exception if they heard about it. 'Agent to the Governor General” inevitably implies residence in an Indian Stete or at least in a country that is in some degree under the control of the Government of India, and Persia is none of these things to-day. There may be no intention using the title in communications to Persian authorities, but if it exists at all it will appear in official publications which the Persians may one day see and may even creep one day into some official or unofficial communica tio n. For all these reasons I should prefer that the Consul General should be called simply ”Consul General for Khorassan” (»br Consul General at Mesned” j for formal and ’’Persian” purposes and 'Consul General forTiast Persia' for everyday purposes (see my letter No. tu?/4-d/2 of August 26th and Chancery letter No. 817/0-15 of September 9th).

Sir John Simon therefore considers that, unless the Secretary of State for India has any objection, His Majesty’s Consul-General in East Persia should be officially known as His Majesty’s Consul-General at Meshed as proposed by His Majesty’s Legation at Tehran. 3.

Dear Department, When the amalgamation of the Meshed and Zabul Consular posts becomes effective, the incumbent of the joint post, whatever the description of his Consular district, will presumably be officially 'His Majesty’s Consul-General at Meshed' or sometimes 'His Majesty’s Consul-General for Khorassan', Sistan being in fact a part of Khorassan, and his winter visits to Zabul being officially in the nature of 'tours'. 2. At the same time the Consul-General will in fact spend quite half the year at Zabul and the major and most important part of his work will arise from matters concerning Sistan and Zahedan. This being so, we have felt that it will be convenient to adopt, for everyday purposes, some title which will describe him adequately wherever he may be, and the title that seems to us the best is 'East Persia*. 3. We have already adopted a special 'East Persia* series of numbers for despatches and telegrams, which will run consecutively throughout the year, wherever the Consul- General may be, 'Meshed' and 'Sistan' numbers being reserved for direct communication with these two posts when the Consul-General The Foreign and Political Department of the Government of India, Simla.Consul-General is at his other headquarters: this direct communication will ordinarily only take place in excentional circumstances. Daly has 'been asked to adopt the same system in numbering his despatches and telegrams to us. 4. Similarly, we propose in future to address despatches to His Majesty’s Consul-General for East Persia, and when conies of despatches are sent to him to. say in the distribution paragraph ,f I have sent a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Consul-General for East Persia (at Meshed)' or ('at Sistan)' as the case may be. Telegrams will be 'Repeated East Persia' though telegrams, whether originals or repeats, will have to be addressed 'Britconsul Meshed' or 'Britconsul Zabul' as before. In practice, of course, all concerned will know where the Consul-General is at any given time of the year. 5. For the purposes of communications to Persians the Consul-General should always be 'His Majesty’s Consul- General at Meshed' and nothing more. 6. We are sending a copy of this letter to the Foreign Office and to East Persia (at Meshed) and hope that the suggestions it contains will be acceptable to all concerned.

(mi Major Daly has now held joint charge of the posts of Consul—General» Meshed and Consul* Sistan since June of last year as a temporary measure, hut experience has shown that this very economical arrangement can he made permanent without difficulty or loss of efficiency and Major Daly has accordingly worked out the necessary details. The principle of amalgamation has now been endorsed hy the Government of India and hy His Majesty’s Minister, The circumstances which have contributed to this /fcycrl satisfactory s tate of affairs are fully explained in Me owing to the restrictions imposed on trade hy the Persian authorities, most Indian traders now find it impossible to compete further north than Birjand and the majority have i transferred their headquarters from Meshed to Birjand, Zabul or Zahidan. This has resulted in a decrease of consular work at Meshed which is now almost entirely in connexion with the annual pilgrimage and therefore concentrated in the pilgrimage season from May to September. Very little has to he done during the winter at Meshed where the cold is very severe. On the other hand winter in Sistan is the season ot greatest activity during which His Majesty’s Consul has always resided in Zahul, hut he is able to leave Zahul in the In paragraph 9 of his despatch Major Daly made three alternative suggestions in regard to the performance ol winter in the absence of the Consul-General - viz: that these duties should he performed hy the Secretary to the Tehran. despatch of 23rd November which forms an enclosure to the Government of India’s letter of 18th April, (P.Z.2562/33). summer when he is most required at Meshed. such consular duties as there are at Meshed during theConsul-General or by a probationer in the Political Department or by a junior Medical Officer - and it will be seen that the Government of India favour the appointment of a Political Probationer, who would proceed to Meshed in May with the Consul-General and remain in charge when the Consul-General left for Zabul in September. The Government of India attach great importance to having a post of this kind where a probationer can be trained under a senior officer before he takes charge of an independent post (paragraph 2-3 of the Government of India’s letter). The pay of the probationer will of course be charged to the Khorasan budget and enter into the account of divisible expenditure. With regard to the financial effect of the amalgamation, we had already received from India a copy of Major Daly’s despatch of 24th November, (P.Z.1158/33) forwarding a detailed statement of savings amounting to over half a lakh of rupees. The Government of India propose certain further reductions in special pay (paras. 4 &amp; 5 of their letter) but otherwise accept Major Daly’s proposals. Besides the saving resulting from amalgamation the Government of India explain that considerable economies have already been effected under the old arrangements as recommended by Colonel Barrett ii^ his report of 30th March 1932, (P.Z.2936/32) and they enclose an interesting statement comparing the budgets of Sistan and Meshed for the year 1931-32 with the combined budget as it will stand in future if the amalgamation proposals are accepted. This statement shows that a reduction of about Rs.65,300 will have been secured as a result of various measures of economy. The present proposals involve the reduction of the/1712b 5000 3.33 3 Minute Paper.

Although we are still without a reply to our letter of 10th February 1932 to the Foreign Ofli ce, (P.Z.7581/31) in which we supported the Government of India’s proposals on the general subject of reorganisatim of Consular posts in Persia, the actual process of reorganisation has not, of course, been impeded. Besides the present proposals it has been decided that the posts of Kerman and Bunder Abbas (already held by a single officer) should be formally amalgamated (P.Z.6642/32) and there is a proposal for the amalgamation of Ispahan and Shiraz (P.Z.1457/33 - the Consul-General at Ispahan was due to take leave this month pending retirement), while the Foreign Office have abolished redundant posts at Hamadan and Resht and the Government of India have decided that the post of Vice-Consul, Ahwaz (at present vacant) is unnecessary, though the Foreign Office may, it seems, wish to appoint a Levant Service Vice-Consul.

Dated Simla, the April 1933. Amalgamation of the Consulate General at Meshed and the Consulate at Sistan. Sir, I am directed to forward a copy of despatch from Major o-.K. Daly, His Britannic Majesty* s Consul, Sistan and Xain, Ho* 485-20/1, dated the 23rd November 1932, and to say that in the circumstances explained the Government of India agree tliat .he amalgamation of the Consulate-General at Meshed with the Consulate at Sistan is desirable from the points of view both of economy and administrative efficiency. I am therefore uo request that if His Majesty*s Government see no objection His Majesty* s Minister, Tehran, may be authorised to approach the Persian Government as suggested by him in paragraph 2 of ^ his despatch Ho.530, dated the 14th December 1932. 2. The Government of India have carefully considered the suggestions made in paragraph 9 of Major Daly’s despatch in regard to the arrangement to be made for the performance of Consular duties at Meshed during the absence of the Consul- u-eneral in winter. Ho doubt the most economical arrangement would be to allow the Secretary to perform these duties in addition to his military work. The Government of India however^ do not favour this arrangement for the following reasons. They consider firstly that the special intelligence duties which the Secretary is required to perform render it v h m &amp;yi&amp;t . undesirable that he should also do Consular work, even thoughv though he were not officially gazetted as Vice-Consul, and the Persians might, and protatly would, ofcject to such duplication of function. Secondly it would 'be extremely hard to leave a single British officer in Meshed to pass the winter alone. If at any time he should fall sich or otherwise become incapable of carrying on his duties there would be great difficulty in making other arrangements in the absence of a second British officer. Thirdly the number of posts in which the junior officers of the Political Department can learn something of the language and conditions of Persia is extremely limited and it is undoubtedly of great value to keep a post of this kind where a probationer can be trained under a senior officer before he takes charge of an independent post. 3. The (rovernment of India therefore would prefer to post a probationer of the Political Department to Meshed for train ing in Persian affairs, the proposal being to send a probationer in May, who would receive training for the summer from the Consul-General and then hold charge during the winter. In the following May the Consul General would return from Geistan accompanied by a new probationer and the first probationer would proceed to Zahidan which post he would hold for a year. The pay and allowances of the probationer will of course be charged to the Khorasan budget. The Government of India consider this equitable,on the whole, as otherwise it might be necessary to send a regular officer on higher pay with consequent increase of cost both to His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India. 4. As His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India is already aware, the posts of Consul General Meshed and Consul Seistan have been temporarily combined for some time. During this period Major Daly has been allowed the following pay and allowances( 124 ) -3- allowances 2) Special pay 1) Pay as on time scale Rs.250 p.m. ' 500 p.m. M 100 p.m. Sumptuary allowance Conveyance allowance Customs Compensatory Meshed post Attached to allowance.

Other reductions proposed in provisions under Allowances and Honoraria, Contingencies and Supplies and Services are self-explanatory and may he accepted. proposed, I am to state that considerable economies have already been effected even under the existing arrangements as recommended by Colonel Barrett in his Despatch Ho. 325/127/10 dated the 30th March 1932, hut a report has been delayed as further developments in connection with the permanent combination were awaited. A list of the economies effected on Colonel Barrett's report in Meshed and Seistan budgets is enclosed for the information of the Secretary of State. In order to give a precise indication of the financial effect of these and the present proposals a comparative statement of the budgets of Seistan and Meshed for the year 1931-32 which was taken by the General 5.

Prom this it will 'be seen that a l budgetary reduction of expenditure of nearly Rs.65300 will have been secured as a result of the various measures of economy, 6* I am to add that for the reasons given by Colonel Barrett in his despatch Fo.325/127/10, dated the 30th March 1932, copy of which was sent to you with my letter No,67(A)M, da ted tne 7th/9th May 1932, and in view of the proposal made in paragraph 1 above, the Government of India have come to the conclusion that the proposal in Foreign and Political Depart ment letter ITo.F,369-IT/30 dated the 19th November 1931 to transfer the headquarters of the Seistan Consulate to Zahidan and to abolish the Vice-Consulate there is no longer feasible and have accordingly decided not to pursue it any further. 7, The proposals involve inter alia, abolition of the post of Consul Ceistan and Kain and in consequence the reduction of the Indian Political Department cadre by one post. The necessary amendment to Superior Civil Service rules will be submitted in due course. 8 * It is requested that the concurrence of His Majesty's Government in the proposals may be communicated by telegram. 9 * A copy of this letter is being sent to His Majesty's Minister, Tehran.

Daly, C.I.E., His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, SlSTAN AND Rain (AND IN ADDITION HlS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S ACTING Consul-General and Agent to the Government of India in Khorassan), No. 485-20/1, dated the 23rd November 1932. In accordance with the instructions conveyed in your demi-official telegram No. 2506 of the 12th November 1932, I have the honour to state my considered views in regard to the possibility of combining the supervision of the Meshed Con sulate General and Sistan Consulate under one Officer and consequent reduction of Staff and expenditure. 2. It will be seen from a separate despatch which I am addressing to vou by this mail in respect of the financial effects of the proposal that the savings which can be made amount to Rs. 50,600 per annum, and in this despatch I therefore confine myself to comments of a non-financial nature. I would, however, observe that this large saving is in addition to the very considerable reductions already made both at Meshed and Sistan in connection with the economy campaign and is solely due to the proposed amalgamation. 3. When I was first appointed to the combined charge of these posts, I informed the Government of India that I foresaw no difficulties during the summer months, but that I would report latter in regard to the winter, after further experience’ On my arrival at Meshed, I discussed the matter in detail with Colonel Barrett and he expressed the opinion that there were no insurmountable difficulties and he anticipated that considerable savings would accrue from such an amalgamation. 4. I have, in consequence, devoted considerable attention to adjusting the administrative side to meet the requirements of the new situation, which has resulted from the fact that, the combination of the posts was subsequentlv extended to cover the present winter. ^ : 5. The situation in East Persia has undergone a very radical change in the past two years. The effect of tiie Persian Trade Monopoly Laws, etc., has become fully felt, and as a result Indian Traders have found it almost impossible to compete further north than Birjand, and their number in Meshed has steadily dwindled until at the present time, there are very few permanently at Meshed. ^ i.-T* 16 ma i? rit y have transferred their Headquarters to Birjand, Zabul or Zahidan, m which localities they can still hold their own against Russian competi- Apart from these traders, there is a small community of Kurrami and Kashmiri protected persons permanently resident at Meshed. As a result of the change of circumstances, work at Meshed Consulate-General has very greatly decreased On the other hand, in many respects that of the Sistan Consulate has increased. \ ,i Th D ta /L fl °T ° f ! le '! laws and ordinances, imperfectly understooc by the Persian Officials, and often maliciously mis-applied, requires the constam intervention of our Consular Officers to protect British subjects, and such work r naturally greatest where the number of British subjects and travellers is largest i.e., m histan Consulate area, which also comprises the Indo-Persian frontier m regard to which matters of importance are always liable to arise. There ar&lt; few such complications at Meshed. The Officials are more responsible and illega lities less frequent while the number of British subjects permanently resident i' so comparatively small that little Consular work results Such Consular work as exists at Meshed, is almost entirely, in connection With the annual pilgrimage. From May to September large numbers of Indians visits Meshed and it is during this season that Consular Intervention and assistance is needed by British subjects. Some dozens of passports have to be examined and vise daily. Financial assistance is afforded to pilgrims who have given adequate security m India, and they are assisted in the multifarious difficulties which arise from the journey, many of which difficulties result from ignorance and unwitting transgression of the complicated laws governing transit and residence of foreigneiS m Persia, Customs regulations, etc., etc. ^ MC5FDr~-~?

From Mid- December till the end of March intense cold is experienced at Meshed and during this period very little trade is done, and the pilgrimage from India is in abeyance. The whole town hibernates and Consular work with the exception of routine reports and assistance to an occasional traveller virtually ceases. On the other hand, winter is the most favourable season in Sistan and it is during these months that there is the greatest activity and consequently the most Consular work in that area, and it is the season during which His Britannic Majesty’s Consul has always resided at Zabul. For the reasons explained above the presence of the Supervising Officer is quite unnecessary at Meshed during the severe winter weather, while he can best be absent from Zabul (and in fact has generally hitherto resided at Birjand) during the summer, when he is most required at Meshed. For the reasons advanced in my despatch No. 368-20/1 of the 20th. August 1031 I consider it very desirable that relations should be maintained with the notables of Kain, and this can be stifricfently attained by a short stay there by the Consul General when carrying out the proposed annual move from Sistan to Meshed. 7. The economy in Staff which can be effected is considerable. Apart from one Clerk and a Persian Munski who would be permanently at Meshed, one Head quarters Staff will perform the duties hitherto carried out by two. The fact that Headquarters would be absent from Meshed in the severity of winter enables considerable economy to be effected in fuel for heatin** offices hitherto a great expense. ^ J »- -c**—L*.— 8. Should this scheme for the combination of the duties of Consul-General Meshed and Consul Sistan be finally approved, I consider that even greater economy could eventually be effected by the disposal of the Consulate-General in Meshed, which is unnecessarily large and expensive to maintain, and the acquisition of a more suitable site on the outskirts of the town on which modern and less expensively maintained buildings could be erected. This proposal was previously made by the late Colonel Biscoe, but was subsequently postponed. It requires to be re examined. It is probable that more suitable buildings could be erected for a sum considerably less than that for which those at present in use could be disposed of the site of which owing to th ) growth of the city, is now very valuable. 9. There remains the question of how the duties, approximating to those of a Vice-Consul, can best be carried out at Meshed, during the absence of His Majesty’s Consul-General in winter. Three alternatives seem possible.. A. That the Secretary should perform the duties in addition to his own military work. He would at the most be occupied very little in mid-winter and it coincides with the period m which his normal work is lightest. If this suggestion were to meet with approval I would jiropose that he be granted a Vice-Consular allowance of Rs. 100 per mensem during the actual period of absence of the Consul- General. I have omitted any proposals regarding this in my despatch on financial matters, because I anticipate that the sum involved could be found from the Contract Grant Office Allowance. It would not be necessary for the Secretaiy to be recognised by the Persians as V Ice-Consul, which I understand it is desired t o avoid, as he can correspond, if necessary on my behalf, in the third person. In practice such correspondence with Persian Officials would be most infre quent, a&amp; matters can generally be best arranged by a personal visit to the Official concerned. 9. B. That a young Political Officer (Probationer) be posted as Vice-Consul. This would involve more expense, but there seems considerable advantages in such a scneme. ® There are few posts in Persia in which young Officers can acquire experience which would eventually fit tnem for the Senior appointments. 1 eh post of Vice-Consul at Zahidan really requires an Officer with some previous experience of -Persia under modern conditions. I imagine that Officers with such qualifications will become increasingly difficult to find.3 If therefore, a probationer were posted to Meshed, he would, under supervision, acquire the experience which would fit him for appointment, later, say to Zahidan or Ahwaz, and an opportunity to learn the language which is of the greatest impor tance in the higher appointments in Persia, under the Government of India, for which he might subsequently be required. C. The third alternative is that a junior Medical Officer and Vice-Consul be appointed as Medical Officer and Vice-Consul at Meshed. This proposal also involves higher expenditure than that under (A) above, but I venture to submit has considerable advantages. I believe that it is the policy of Government to retain a certain number of Indian Medical Service Officers in Civil employ, as a Military Eeserve, and that apart from the necessity or otherwise of the Civil appointments they occupy, such a minimum reserve must be maintained. If I am correct in this supposition, there seems no more suitable place than Meshad, for such an appointment. The medical arrangements for the Consulate Staff and British subjects perma nently in Meshad are by no means adequate. Since the reduction of the post of the Medical Officer we have been paying Rs. 100 per mensem to the American Missionary Doctor. This sum would be saved towards the cost of the Consulate Medical Officer. Unfortunately the qualifications of the Missionary Doctor here are not of the highest. In fact his skill is regarded by the Persians (and I think most of the Europeans) as of such an order that even the Consulate menials frequently prefer to pay for attention at the Persian Hospital ✓ (which is such that no sensible person would resort to it) rather than have the free treatment at the Mission. More important than this, is the fact that the sick among the very large num bers of pilgrims who visit Meshad from India in summer, are fleeced by unskilled Persian quacks, or, in the rare cases in which they elect to go to the Mission, are by no means satisfied by the treatment, and I have received repeated requests from res ponsible persons among them, to urge the necessity for a British Medical Officer. It so happens that diseases are rife in Meshad in summer, and considerable numbers of the pilgrims fall a prey to the insanitary conditions existing in the so- called hotels and caravanserais. It is freely stated that of the total number who arrive in Meshad with the intention of staying a week or ten days, probably 50% fall sick and are obliged to prolong their stay. Judging from the number of applications I received this summer, in connection with the extension of the validity travel documents beyond 3 months owing to serious illness, I believe this to be no over-statement. Many arrive sick after the hardships of travel by road in mid-summer. They are ignorant of Persian and rightly mistrust the local Doctors. The Mission dispensary is some to 2 miles from the centre of the town and they avoid it; and more often than not come to the Consulate to seek medical aid, which, of course, is not now available. A Sub-Assis tant Surgeon, such as w r e have at Birjand could be substituted for a young British Medical Officer, but in view of the presence of high Persian Officials in Meshad, and of the fact that w T e have a British Officer designated “ Secretary ”, I am inclined to the view that such an appointment would not be satisfactory. Meshad has many pitfalls for an inexperienced Indian official of this class. The records of several Indian attaches who were dismissed for mis-conduct (sometimes for unsatisfactory relations with other Consulates) discourage me from recommend ing this solution, attractive as it may be on financial grounds. The same objections might not apply to a carefully selected British Assistant Surgeon of the Indian Medical Department, but senior men of the right type are very little cheaper than a young I. M. S. Officer on first appointment to the Department and the latter’s status would be of some political advantage.

We will Pe addressing you officially on the subject shortly. Walton, Esq.., C.B. M.C., Secretary^ Political Department, India Office, London. —3 When I was first appointed to the combined charge of these posts, I informed the Government of India that I foresaw no difficulties during the summer months, Put that I would report later in regard to the winter, after further experience. On my arrival at Meshad, I discussed the matter in detail with Oolonel Barrett, and he expressed the opinion that there were no insurmountable difficulties and he anticipated that consideraPle savings would accrue from such an amalgamation. 4. I have, in consequence, devoted consideraPle atten tion to adjusting the administrative side to meet the requirements of the new situation, which has resulted from the fact that, the combination of the posts was subsequently extended to cover the present winter. 5. The situation in Bast Persia has undergone a very radical change in the past two years. The effect of the Persian Trade Monopoly Laws etc. has become fully felt, and as a result Indian Traders have found it almost impossible to compete further north than Birjand, and their number in Meshad has steadily dwindled until at the present time, there are very few permanently at Meshad. The majority have transferred their Headquarters to Birjand, Zabul, or Zahidan, in which localities they can still hold toeir own against Russian competition. Apart from these traders, there is a small community of Kurrami and Kashmiri protected persons permanently resident at Meshad. As a result of the change of circumstances, work at Meshad Consulate General has very greatly decreased. On the other hand, in many respects that of the Sis tan Consulate has increased. The constant flow of new laws and ordinances, imper fectly understoodimperfectly understood t&gt;y tde Persian Officials, and often maliciously mis-applied, requires the constant intervention of our Consular Officers to protect British subjects, and such work is naturally greatest where the number of British subjects and travellers is largest, i.e. In Sistan Consulate area, which also comprises the Indo-Persian frontier, in regard to which matters of importance are always liable to arise. There are few such complications at Keshad. The officials are more responsible and illegalities less frepuent while the number of British subjects perman ently resident is so comparatively small that little Consular work results. Such Consular work as exists at Meshad, is almost entirely in connection with the annual pilgrimage. Prom May to September large numbers of Indians visit Meshad and it is during this season that Consular intervention and assistance is needed by British subjects.

Under Secretary.. Secretary of St^te, Q) / Copy of yh t to FOR INFORMATION. &gt;) VJ Previous Papers :— liT. Bristow, H.M. Consul-General at Isfahan has applied lor leave next iviay pending retirement, and as a result of discussion with the Consul-General H*L. Minister i'enran is satisfied that the retention of the Consulate- General at Isfahan is no longer necessary. He has accordingly proposed in his despatch No.484 of 18th November last (P.Z.485/33) that the posts at Isfahan and Shiraz should he amalgamated into a single Consulate with headquarters at Shiraz, the consular hull dings at Isfahan being retained on a 'care and maintenance' basis and visited by the Consul three or four times a year.2. This proposal has roused the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to put forward again in private correspondence with the Indian Foreign Secretary (Colonel Fowle's letters of 30th November ana 15th February last - P.Z.81/53 and 1457/33) his own views regarding future arrangements at Shiraz. These are briefly that Isfahan has a larger foreign community than Shiraz and is urima facie the more suitable post for a permanent consul, that a consular agent should accordingly be^substituted for a Consul at Shiraz which would automatically come under the Consul-General at Bushire, that sbiraz is from the tribal-political point of view in the Bushire area and only 170 miles from Bushire by road as compared with 300 miles from Isfahan, and that his proposals are Just as economical as hr. Hoare's ana have the additional advantage that the Residency Builalngs at Shiraz could be used as ^ summer resiaence for the Resident (for which they were originally built) instead of being used as the Headquarters of a Levant Service Consul. 3. There is perhaps a good aeal to be said for the Political Resident's point of view, but as hr. Metcalfe points out in his letter of 26th January (P.Z.840/33) the Minister's proposals only amount to a readjustment of at Consular representation Isfahan and Shiraz, both of which are Levant Service posts, and do not conflict with the views expressed in paragraph 6 of the Government of India's letter of 19th November 1931 (P.Z.7581/31) where tne Government of India agreed that the district of the Consul-General, Bushire should be limited to the jurisdiction of the Persian Governor of the Gulf Ports ana thus exclude Shiraz. In making this decision the Government of India fully considered but did not accept the views of Colonel Fowle( ana also is may be added of Co Ionel/1212 5f,C0 9.32 3 .i/;- Minute Paper.

Without being malicious it is fair to suggest that Colonel i^’owle is very largely influenced by the aesire to get back the use of the Residency at Shiraz as summer quarters for the Resident, and indeed it is only natural that this should be rather a sore point with the Resident. The buildings are the property of the Government of India and charges in connexion with their upkeep erre* still charged (in the first instance) to Indian revenues although most of the consular budget is of course chargeable (in the first instance) to Foreign Office funds. At present if the Resident goes to Shiraz on summer recess, a house has to be rented for him, and it was agreed with the Foreign Office in 1930 that the final solution of this question and possible transfer of the Shiraz Residency to the Foreign Office should be deferred until arrangements for transferring tne Headquarters of the Resident to the arab littoral of the Gulf were under consideration. 5. With regard to Colonel Fowle's suggestion that Shiraz should be transferred to the Indian sphere and a consular agent appointed to the post, the general policy of this office in the past as laid down in &gt; Lord korley's despatch of 25th June 1909 and based to some extent on financial grounds has been that inland consular appointments in Persia should as a general rule be officered from the Levant Consular Service* with the two important exceptions of keshed and Sistan. The/■fr. i-^&gt;^ Kt ; : Jr 4. ] The consulate at Shiraz was created in 1903 as a ; Levant Service post although the Foreign Office were at ml that time in favour of staffing it from the Indian ■ Political Departeent. In order to terminate the state| of friction which existed between Shiraz and Bushire ' (for the province of Fars was until recently included in the district of the Consul-General, Bushire, •although Shiraz itself was officered from the Levant Service) the Foreign Office proposed in a letter of 26th February 1914 that the Shiraz post should be handed over to an officer of the Indian Political Department, finding a general consensus of opinion in favour of this on the part of the Minister, the Political Resident and the Consul. The proposal was forwarded to India but consideration of it was deferred) I rvi owing to the war. During the war, however, the post was, owing to special circumstances, held by a succession of Indian Political Officers and it was not until 1921 that a Levant service Consul was .again {appointed. The Foreign Office oecid-ed to appoint this |officer (Lr. Chick) without consulting this department |or the Government of India and although we acquiesced in the arrangement we protested against the procedure adopted and asked that adequate time might be given for) consulting the Government of India before making anothe ■■appointment. In 1929, however, when In. Chick || |relinquished the post it does not appear that any icorrespondence passed with the Government of India regarding the future of the Shiraz Consulate which Jlstill continues to be staffed by the Levant Service.'* '| 6 . There is no indication that the Government of L ^llnlia have arc/ desire to take over 3 hiraz at the presenft tiine and, as mentioned above, they agreed in 1931 to ahe exclusion of r'ars from the district of the Consul- General/ f sir, T. noijif A 7 ^ /O' ^ ^ It. VPaper Department. General Bushire, the Consul-General retaining the right of proceeding to Shiraz on auty in the sunnier when circumstances permitted of his going on recess. Colonel Fowle’s suggestions are in some ways attractive and they would no. doubt be economical at the present time. It is probable however that a Consular Agent will not always be capable of looking after Shiraz, ana if a Consul has to be appointed it is desirable on financial grounds that he should come from the Levant Service. . In any case the Foreign Office might be expected to fight tooth and nail against surrendering Shiraz. Colonel Fowle*s final suggestion, that both Isfahan and Shiraz Consulates might be abolished, would probably be cutting things rather fine. At any rate we can await Lr.Letcalfe’s reaction to tne Resident's last letter before finally deciding whether the question is worth pursuing. 7. We are still.awaiting a reply from the Foreign Office to our letter of 10th February 1932 regarding the general question of reorganisation of Consular posts in Persia, but I understand from the Foreign Office tnat they will reply when they are able after consultation with i’ehran (now almost completed) to put forward a general scheme embracing also proposals for the future incidence of diplomatic and consular expenditure. The discussion of these proposals should present an opportunity of disposing of the question of the Shiraz Residency by handing it over to the Foreign Office as part of a general settlement.8 . We are also waiting i'or the dovemriient of India's views about the amalgamation of Leshed and Sistan. 7 /e nave not yet had a copy of Lajor Daly's despatch of a3ra November setting forth his general proposals (the Government of India have been asked to supply a copy) but from the detailed statement given in his despatch of 24th November (P.Z.1158/33) it will be seen that savings are proposed amounting to over half a lakh.

Department British revenues woaid benefit. Schemes have been put interesting if the p .O., in connection with a new scheme of economy which they are preparing, should now also raise the question of the allocation of diplomatic and consular expenditure. The present basis of allocation (fifty-fift^ ) has long been felt, both by H.I .G. and by the G. of I., for different reasons, to be unsatisfactory, host of the posts are nan;-ed by officers of the Levant Service, and are maintained mainly in wide Imperial interests; on the other hand, the posts manned by the C. of I. are relatively expensive, owing to the difference m pay between the two services. The question was last exhaustively considered in a prolonged correspondence proposed that the arbitrary half-and-half division of expenditure should be abolished, and that India should bear all ordinary expenditure at the Eastern consulates (heshed, Seistan, Kerman and Bandar Abbas), one-third of that at Bushire and one-third of that at Tehran, and should man Bushire ana the Eastern consulates. The F.O. proposed that they should/man all posts except Bushire, and ultimately bear -the whole of the cost, with a contribution of £50,000 a year from India. No decision was arrived at. ^. 0 . the general question of the incidence of diplomatic and consular expenditure, with'a view r to anticipating a forward by Sir B. Olive and.by the G. of I. It will be between the r '. of I., this Office and the T? .0., between the years 1922 and 1926; the G. of I. and the 1.0. 77e have already contemplated that, once the Sinkiang question is settled, we should take up with the demand/deman (^perhaps for a tribunaljby Indian public opinion. It is to be hoped that the. Indian public may be got to recognise the advantage which, by paying soreuLing, I obtains in manning the consulates, on. her borders, ana m obtaining a much more powerful and direct influence on P.I'.G. *8 foreign policy than that which is enjoyed by the Dominions. The usual Indian argument that the (other; self-governing Dominions do not contribute to H.h.G.’s diplomatic and consular expenditure, is really a most misleading one. India, being the*only country in the Empire exposed to any likelihood of attack by land, has direct and obvious interest in the diplomatic, as wtil as in the military^ defence of her frontiers. aJ£*-r\ fO. f'. :, v SEEN pf*! L C- 1 1TTE-E, (A* O ^ -&gt;**&lt;*) ■ j ci APR 1935/ ( ' V ' ; The last paragraph of Mr. Walt on* s note is very much to th^point. But Indian political opinion is in favour of generous expenditure of Indian /V revenues on Indian consular and diplomatic work on her frontiers provided India really plays a part in the manning at any rate of the Consulates. There is a general impression that Indians and Indian interests do not receive the same protection from. Foreign Office officials as purely British/ Everything possible is done to shake this idea by very carefully worded answers in the Assembly and personal influ ence in the Lobby and with reputable journalists. JPPt the idea. however, is firmly rooted and is bound to Receive strength from the drying up of Indian trade in Persia^ and the exodus of Indian traders whose firms have been established for more than a hundred years and from the expulsion of Indians from Mexico. Indian opinion is dead against the expenditure of/ aof Indian moneys on the upkeep of purely British establishments to which the Dominions do not contribute. It is not averse to expenditure on posts manned by the Indian Political Department and controlled in some degree by the Government of India, though, of course, critical of the amounts. But it is becoming increasingly insistent that India must man the Consulates genuinely - i.e, that the Indian Consuls should contain an Indian element. Herein lies one of the arguments for the continued Indianisation of the Jalalabad and Kandahar Consulates. It is also an argument in favour of t Colonel Fowles proposal (which otherwise appeals to me as an essentially practical one) in that a Consulq^EAgency at Shiraz would provide another opening for Indianisation.1 Mr. ■ lx. Wakely, Submission of Sir Denys Bray’s note on P.Z. 1553/33 below was suspended pending discussion of the general question of consular reorganisation with Colonel Fowle. Unfortunately, owing to the pressure on the Resident's time, it proved impossible to find time for any very exhaustive discussion of this point. His general views are, however, set out in paragraph 3 of my reference to him of 3rd May and the copy of a personal letter from the Resident to Mr. Metcalfe sated 3rd April, below. 2 . I think, on the whole, our best tactics would be to let the Foreign Office show their hand about consular reorganisation before we commit ourselves. If they do come i forward with a proposal for a Consul-General at Ahwaz we 7 . k can bear Colonel Fowle's points in mind ana ao our best to luu j ^ secure a compromise in regard to them. As regards the for its i future of Chiraz the prospects of our securing any modification of the provisional Foreign Office proposals/^) incorpqia exc isridie'Tsfahah district seem gly poor, and^despite the Resident's anxiety to secure its retention in the Bushire area and the Government of India's support (lajor Fraser-Tytler*s letter of 3rd April on P.Z.2103/33), I doubt if we shall succeed in doing k. 4* iwa; more than securing an arrangement under which the Resident ^ S pend part of his recess at Shiraz. Here too we can, however, do our utmost when the time comes. A**- * /u r l/i. tattoo CC1 / Colonel Powle, / I cio not know if you would care to discuss the question of consular reorganisation while you are here? You mentioned, i think, that you thought it preferable not to talk it over with the Foreign Office. 2. The general position at the moment is that the Foreign Office seem wedded to the proposal to amalganate the posts at Isfahan and Shiraz into a single Consulate with headquarters at Shiraz, the consular buildings at Isfahan being retained on a care and maintenance basis and visited by the Consul three or four times a year. While the arguments in support of the establishment of an Indian Consular Agent at Shiraz ana the placing of these-poster under Bushire are substantial and have now secured a general support from the Government of India, discussion with Mr. Christopher Warner has left me with the quite definite impression that there is no prospect of a compromise on this point with the Foreign Office and that the most we can hope for is a working arrangement unaer which the new Consul at Shiraz should pay his visits to Isfahan at a period in the summer which would leave the Consulate at Shiraz available for the Political Resident for between two and three months. 3. You mentioned, I think, that Mr. Hoare had returned to the charge about a Foreign office Consulate General at Ahwaz. We do not seem to have had any correspondence on this subject yet ana are not quite clear as to how much ground the proposal covers or in what detail it has been put forward, but it would be very useful to have your views on record if you cared to record them.* r I think one of the difficulties we felt was that in the event of the Residency being moved from Bushire the position of an '•Inspecting Consul General* (the sole object of which is to give the Resident a title to visit Persian ports from his Arab headquarters) would lose some of its value, since it would not be possible for him to inspect any post, such as Ahwaz or Moharrmerah, which was in the area of another Consul General, and further that you saw advantage in retaining general political control of the Persian littoral in fact, if not in theory, in the hands of the Resident, in view of the difficulties which might otherwise arise in the event of a collapse or slackening of control of the Central authority in Persia in the future.X Personal and Confidential. The Residency, BUSHIRE, the 3rd April, 1933. Many thanks for your personal letter of the 20th March. You are of course quite correct in your criticism of my use of the term ’political control’: it should have been 'consular control’. I must point out, however, that there is in my mind certainly no remnant of the old tendency to regard Persia as an Indian State, and ourselves as the Paramount Power responsible for maintaining peace and order. Far from advocating intervention and unnecessary commitments in this country, I am strongly of opinion that even with regard to the Arab States of the other side of the Gulf, of which I suppose in a sense we are the Paramount Power, we should pursue as liberal a policy as possible. In fact only a few days ago, in connection with the possible visit of the Shaikh of Kuwait to England as the guest of the Eastern and General Syndicate, I oemed a despatch to you which contained this remark: 'On the other hand the days, in my opinion, have definitely gone by when we can keep the more important Arab Rulers of the Gulf - so long as they adhere to the terms of their treaties with us - in leading strings. I think in the long run we are likely to get more from them by - whenever possible - letting them make their own cnoice, with the ensuing consequences.” My despatch too, i: 0 . 7 B 4 -S of 17th October 1932 on the subject of Bahrain, was of the general tenor that there vis-a-vis Persia Bis Majesty's Government had intervened too much. So much by the way of a personal explanation. 2. May I now state my case again, perhaps more concisely, as follows? (a) It is generally believed by those best qualified to hold an opinion, amongst others, the present Minister at Tehran H. A. F. Metcalfe, Esq., C.I.E. ,M. V.O., Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, New Delhi.( 1 ) that when Reza Shah dies a state of disturbance, perhaps anarchy, will for some time probably ensue in Persia; (2) that Reza Shah himself is deteriorating physically and mentally and losing his grip. (b) It is in Southern Persia, always less under control than Northern Persia, that the 'crash* will be most felt, and it is in Southern Persia that the Government of India is most interested. (c) We are definitely not responsible for peace and order in Persia, but if disturbances get too serious we may be forced to take some steps to protect British and British-Indian lives, property, and interests, as we have had to do in similar circumstances in the past. (d) In such an eventuality it would be advantageous for the Consul-General, Bushire, to exercise a single co-ordinating consular control of the consular districts in South Persia, lsimilar to the control which existed in the past under like Iconditions. (e) The Comnander-in-Chief, East Indies Squadron, and the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf Division, whom I approached unofficially and privately on the subject are of the opinion that from the Naval point of view such a control would be most useful, since it would be obviously much easier for the last named officer to deal with one Consular Officer, Consul-General, Bushire, (who as Political Resident could also take into consideration the needs of the Arab Coast), than with several. (f) The consular areas concerned are: ( 1 ) Bandar Abbas - Kerman; (2) Shiraz; (3) Mohammerah - Ahwaz. With regard to (1). Many thanks for the support given in yo ur tel egpg.pri Nq.744.- of 25th March to the proposal that 'Bandar Abbas should be put under the superirtmdence of/of this Consulate-General. If this finally goes through Bandar Abbas is disposed of. I am doubtful how I stand with reference to Kerman, but do not think it important. I have always regarded Kerman as outside the Gulf area. With regard to (2). Shiraz, on the other hand, should, in my opinion, come under the superintendence of Bushire. With regard to (3). The proposals contained in Bray?s letter of 19th April 1926 to Minister, Tehran, and the latter's acquiescence in these proposals, (enclosed with your letter} do not put either Consul, Ahwaz, or Vice Consul, Mohammerah, under my superintendence. The proposals only suggest that the latter should deal with finance and accounts through the Consulate-General, Bushire, and that in M certain matters connected with the maritime administration of the Gulf, treatment of Indians, dealings with the Arabian littoral and the like it might be advantageous for the Consul, Ahwaz, and the Vice Consul, Mohammerah, to consult the Resident direct and in general to follow his lead.' The Vice Consul, Mohammerah, is now definitely under the Consul, Ahwaz, and the latter equally definitely under the Minister, and I have always been most careful to recognize this fact, and to act - or rather abstain from acting - accordingly. tg) If the co-ordinated Consular control suggested is considered desirable, then the only way to bring it about is by putting the Consular officers concerned, according to a Foreign Office practice, under the superintendence of the Consul-General Bushire. To ask the Persian Government to extend the exequatur of the Consul-General, Bushire,, would be out of the question, and to get them to recognize officially the Superintendence* arrangement would be difficult. However, as you say, this does not matter. (h) I should like to emphasize the fact that behind my suggestion for ’superintendence* there lies no idea whatever for an ’ imnerium in imnerio 1 under the aegis of the Consul- General, Bushire. The latter officer is definitely under the orders of the Minister, and such ’superintendence* would v ot/not&gt; cut off the latter from direct contact with, or from giving direct instructions to, the other Consular officers involved, should he see fit to do so. It would, however, give the Consul-General, Bushire, a status by which he could visit and discuss matters with the Consular Officers under his superintendence, (if they are not under his superintendence he has no business to have official contact with them at all), and put up to the Minister and the Government of India Suggestions for co-ordination of our efforts over the whole I f the area, of which the various consular districts involved re merely parts. (i) Even in ordinary times I think such ’superintendence’ would have advantages, and if Reza Shah dies, or falls from power, personally I think it would be essential. I do not, however, intend to pursue this matter officially for the present. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) T.C.Fowle.private / BY AIR ^AIL&gt; Please refe s personal and confidential letter of the 15th February 1933, regarding the proposed amalgamation of the Ispahan and Shiraz Consulates, a copy of which was sent to you direct. As you will have seen from Hoare’s letter of the 18th ITovernber 1932, he recommended the incorporation of the Ispahan Consulate-General in the Consular District of Shiraz as the former post '’does not provide sufficient work of a responsible kind to fill the time of an active officer.” Similarly Fowl© in his letter of 30th liovember 1932 pointed out that there is little or no consular work at Shiraz and that our interests there could well be looked after by a Consular Agent. You will now find a combination ox these two points of view in the proposal put forward in paragraph 4 of Fowle*s personal and confidential letter of 15th February. We have hitherto supported Hoare f s proposal, but Fowle’s opinion in regard to these Consulates must carry considerable weight and if it is administratively possibleto ^l&amp;ce Ispahan under the Tehran Consulate* the financial saving of such an amalgamation -would make the scheme worth serious consideration* I hope * therefore that when considering Hearers original proposal you will bear in mind the possibility of effecting the further reduction now proposed by rowle* I am sending copy of this letter to kowle*In any further communication on this subject, please quote No. K 109/11/234 and address, not to any person by name, but to— “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.VV. i.

I am afraid that ray letter of 30th November was rather diffuse and not as clear as it might iave been. At the conclusion of your letter you say. ” ..he economy vvhich will result both to His Majesty’s Government and to the Government of India from the adoption of Hoare’s proposals make those proposals very attractive and on general grounds we are certainly not inclined to oppose them.” Hut my counter proposals are just as economical as noare’s* and have in inj opinion certain additional advantages. 3. Briefly the position is this. Hoare proposes to abolish Ispahan and retain Ghiraz. 1 propose to abolish Ghiraz and retain Ispahan. ^e both propose that there should be some sort of small consular establishment in the post - | Jhiraz or Ispahan, as the case may be - v/hieh the Consul will , \ visit from time to time from his headquarters. .uoare s arguments for his proposal are contained in his letter on the * subject. The main arguments for my proposal can be summarise^ as follows: la) • A .f. Mie t call e, j’jS q • , C • I .ii • ,a.V.u. , Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, New j&gt;elhi.la) The 3hiraz Consulate though originally buit as summer quarters for the Resident from Government of India funds, and kept in repair from the same source, is at present occupied by a Foreign Office Consular official; i.e. Consul, Shiraz. The Resident and staff therefore, unlike all other British Officers in the Gulf who proceed on hot weather —^ recess, generally remain in Bushire because they have no convenient accommodation in Shiraz, where officially they are supposed to go on recess. I was glad to see from your letter that the Government of India agree with me that it is most necessary for the Resident to have some recess quarters. lb) If my proposal were adopted of substituting j for Consul,Shiraz, a Consular Agent, the latter would live in the town and leave the Consulate free for the Resident. !c) This year as the Consulate is not available for my recess I propose trying to hire a house and garden in Shiraz as a predecessor of mine - Haworth - did some years ago. The house and garden will of course not be nearly as suitable or comfortable as the Consulate, and its hire will bf an additional expense to the Government of India. Id) As Hoare points out, some expense will have -* to be incurred in keeping up the Ispahan Consulate. This expense will presumably only serve the purpose of housing the Consul, Ihiraz, on his occasional visits. The same expense incurred for Chiraz will provide not only for occasional visi'^ /• of the Resident - in his consular capacity - but also for providing him with summer recess quarters. Ie) If a Consular Agent were substituted for a Consul at Shiraz, presumably Shiraz would automatically come-3- \ under the Consul-General, Bughire, and this from the ? of view of the Government of India, since the Consul-i ig an Indian official, would be of advantage in times of \ trouble. ' \ (f) Shiraz is about 170 miles from Bushire, ano 300 miles from Ispahan. i/or the purposes of consular visits therefore Shiraz is considerably nearer to Bushire than to Ispahan. Ispahan has a larger foreign community than Shiraz and therefore prirna facie is the more suitable post for a permanent Consul. J 4. There is a third course of action which has not yet \ f been put forward either by Hoare or myself, ana which would effect a larger saving than either of our proposals. This would be to substitute at Shira* a Consular Agent for the Consul as I suggest, abolish the consular post at Ispahan, (though keeping there a small consular establishment), nd pu Ispahan under the Consul, Tehran, who works of course cHTrestly^ under the Minister. From Tehran to Ispahan is almost exactly the same (300 miles) as from Ghiraz to Ispahan, the distance which Hoare proposes should be covered by one Consul. The Consul, Tehran, is of course a fairly bugy individual, but should be able to find time for the three or four visits a year wh.ch Hoare proposes, more especially as there is generally a probationer Vice Consul working in the egation. If this proposal were adopted there would be a saving not of one Consular post _ Shiraz or Ispahan, but two - Shiraz and Ispahan.

Sir, I have the honour to refer to my despatch No. 485- englosure ^ ^ • L ! INDIA FOREIGN SECB CT 'RY’/ _ _ nri private establishment inevitably involves increased expenditureexpenditure in many directions, and such moves are classed as ’Tours*, the person affected drawing only one road mileage allowance for himself. Circumstances are such in East Persia that the moves are in reality practically a transfer involving movement of household equipment and families. As a result the travelling allowance is generally insufficient to cover the cost, and members of the staff endeavour, as far as possible to maintain duplicate equipment at the two main stations to avoid the great expense of moving. This inevitably causes extra expense. Under the circumstances - 1 - would strongly recommend that this small allowance should be sanctioned, and have made provision for it under this heading. The. same remarks apply to the post of Extra Assis tant. This post formerly cairried Special Pay Rs 50/-, which was reduced on Mr. Hart’s recent appointment. Por the reasons explained above I strongly recommend that it be now sanctioned. Mr. Hart is married - has a child and moving his family and effects must inevitably cost a good deal of money in excess of the single allowance permissible at tour rates. The same remarks would apply equally to the post oi Consul General, who must equally move equipment and family etc., tantamount to an annual transfer, but drawing travelling allowance at tour* rate only. Having regard, however, to the allowance already attached to the post, I consider that no extra provision for this post is Justified and that the extra expense involved should be met by the incumbent. This in reality amounts to a reduction of the allowance estimated at about Rs 125/- per mensem. 0.7.C«7.Co n tinge ncies. A reduction is anticipated under telegram charges ouing to amalgamation. In this connection it may he remarked that some savings will also accrue to the Foreign and Political Department since expensive foreign telegrams hitherto repeated to hoth leshed and Sis tan, wou^L in future require only one address.

This was reduced hy my predecessor to Ss 25,000/- and suhseq.uen1 surrenders made which brought the actu/al expenditure rightly effected, and this economy was only possible, because normal annual repairs to buildings, replacements of menials uniforms and equipment etc., were postponed* Consequent on this, correspondingly heavy expenditure has had to be incurred this year, without w;hich permanent and serious damage would have resulted to buildings etc. My proposal for next year is based at Es 18,000/- which I consider the minimum on which the Consulate General can be efficiently maintained. Some reduction has also become possible under the Sistan Consulate grant as a of Rs 800/- only (the real saving is fis 9,000/-), because I have included under this head, for reasons given be!9w, the provision for escort charges and Dak: Sowars hitherto down to Rs 19,000/-. This was at a time when owing to the severe financial stringency every possible saving was result of amalgamation while on the other hand allowance has had to be made for certain new incidental expenditure resulting from the necessary moves of Head The actual figure under this heading shews a saving separatelyseparately 'budgeted* The net saving of Rs 9,000/-, following on the drastic reductions already effected doth at Feshed and Sis tan, is not incosiderahle. 0.4.S upp 1iss_^nd_Seryiees A FainXenanc e oT l orry . In spite of increased necessity for the lorry and inevitable increase in its use, I estimate that with strict supervision the sum already sanctioned can be made to suffice. The lorry has been maintained in a high state of efficiency. It was originally sanctioned on the understanding that it should not be replaced for three years. I am, however, glad to be able to report that I anticipate that it will remain in efficient wording order for a period of about five years in all, after which time it may become uneconomical to run further. 0.2. Pay of _jjs tab 1 ishmen ts. Dak Sowars &amp; Escort Charges. In the original schemes sanctionea for the East Persia Consulates funds T^guired under these heads were 'included in the office allowance - Contract grant. Subsequently, owing to the fact that regular -^nciian Cavalry escorts were provided separate budget provision was made. have since reverted to the employment of local men and pensioners for this work. The present system whereby these charges are an auditable grant, ana which the supervising officer cannot, therefore, vary without higher sanction, is now highly inconvenient and waste^ful. As examples The scale of pay of Sowars etc., is definitely fixed and cannot be varied without sanction, whereas if it wereI were open to the supervising' oil icer to vary tn regard to local standard ol‘ wafe'es and supply and deriiand, economy could often he effected. The scale of fodder is fixed and cannot he varied except with special sanction. This is highly inconvenient and results in had feeding of the horses, and waste of money. At certain seasons, fodder other than that provided for in the scale, can he more advantageously purchased ana is better for the animals. Bah Sowars . Gould he vaired in number as required. That is to say more men are required when headquaters is at Sis tan, and some could he dispensed with at other times, couriers on the Feshed route being substituted. Such an arrangement cannot he made, if the sanction of higher authority he necessary to every change, since consider able delay must elapse - consequently more men are permanently employed th^n is absolutely necessary. I, therefore, have shewn the charges under the combined ’Office allowance contract grant*, and trust that the Government of India will he pleased, in the event of the scheme being approved to sanction this. I anticipate that it will be possible to effect some savings in this connection which would, in due course, he surrendered, inspite of the fact that 3s 3,500/- had recently been permanently reduced under these heads. A copy of this despatch is being forwarded to His Britannic Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, under Ho. 102, dated the 24th November 1932. I have the honour- to be. Sir, four most obedient servant, Sd/- C.K.Daly, Major, C.I.S.X V/ould you ploase refer to Fowle T s personal and confidential letter of the 30th November 1932 regarding the proposed amalgamation of the Ispahan and Shiraz Consulates, of which, I understand, a copy was sent to you. ,7e have examined the matter here and Hoare f s proposals appear to amount only to a readjustment of the Consular Representation in Ispahan and Shiraz^, both of which are at present under the control of the Tehran Legation. They do not moreover conflict in any way with the views expressed by the Government of India in Howell T s letter NO.F.369-N/30, dated the 19th November 1931, to the Under Secretary of State for India, which viev/s were formed after full considera tion of the opinions put forward by Fowle and now referred to by him in his personal letter. It will be observed that in that letter the Government of India (vide paragraph 6) agreed that the District of the Consul-General,Bushire, should be limited to the jurisdiction of the Governor of the Gulf Ports and should exclude the Province of Laristan along with Fars,which would then form one Consular District with headquarters atat Sniraz - the status of the post being reduced to that of a Vice-Consul. They added however that it would be understood that the Consul General at Bushire should continue to be allowed to proceed to Shiraz on duty in summer when circumstances permitted of his proceeding on recess. It may be that Hoare T s present proposals for the establishment of a Consul at Shiraz in place of a Vice-Consul will make it difficult for the Consul-General from Bushire to use the Shiraz Consulate for his recess and I would suggest that this point may be borne in mind when the proposals are being considered. The Government of India agree with Fowle that it is most necessary for the Consul General to have some place of this kind to go to in the summer so long as his headquarters remain at Bushire. On the other hand, the economy Vvnicn will result both to His Majesty f s Government and to the Government of India from the adontion of Hoare T s oroposals make those proposals very attractive, and on general grounds we are certainly not inclined to oppose them.

Mr# Bristow has confirmed my impression that although there is a not inconsiderable amount of routine work the post does not provide sufficient work of a responsible kind to fill the time of an active officer# d# I am on the other hand unwilling to recommenu the complete abolition of the post* as I recognise the force of the argument frequently brought forward that if circumstances were to lead to a loosening of the control now exercised from the capital the appointment of Consuls to many posts where their presence is now superfluous might again become necessary# 5# In The Eight Honourable Sir John Simon G.C.S.I#, etc#* etc#* etc#* The Foreign Office#- 2 . 5. In these circumstances a suitable solution would he the appointment of an honorary Consul and Mr. Bristow has during the last few weeks sounded with my approval Mr. Moir f of Ziegler and Company* as to his willingness to accept the appointment* perhaps on some arrangement by which he would occupy and maintain the Consular property. Unfortunately, the affairs of Ziegler and Company are at present in so uncertain a state that Mr. Moir has been reluctantly forced to decline on the ground that he cannot give any guarantee that he will continue to reside in Isfahan even for a year or two. As there is no other British subject both suitable and available for the position* I have been forced to abandon this line of enquiry. 6* The solution which I accordingly recommend is that the Consular district of Isfahan should be incorporated in the Consular district of Shiras* but that the Consular property at Isfahan should be retained on what I may call a 'care and maintenance” basis. The combined districts should afford adequate scope for the activities of a Consul* who would be expected to pay three or four visits to Isfahan a year* while the cost of two separate consular establishments would not be excessive. 7. In making this recommendation, I am to some extent influenced by the fact that the prospects of disposing of the Isfahan property are very small. It stands in what has now ceased to be a good residential quarter and there are in any case few inhabitants of the town* whether Persian or foreign* who could afford in the present hard times to buy or maintain a property of this else. A further consideration is that the municipality may wish to take a portion of the property for the purpose of widening«*» widening tde lane on the west side, ihe cost of re-huilding the wall on that Bide would he fairly high and while His Majesty* I Government might he able to obtain compensation from the munio- ipality, it is certain that no one else would have the slightest chance of doing so* Ho one is consequently in the least likely to buy the property while threatened with this expense* 8* I have also considered the possibility of disposing of a portion of the property* At present the only way in which this could be done would be to divide it from north to south (i*e* f vertically) into two narrow strips, retaining the old Consulate offices, the main entrance and the bulk of the garden in the one and the main building and the stables in the other* The eost of making a second entrance and building a partition wall would, however, probably swallow up most of the money derived from the sale and the result would in any case be two properties neither of any great utility or convenience* If however the anticipated street-widening takes place, it will be possible to make a direct entrance into the northern part of the property and enable the southern part, consisting of the present entrance, offices and stables to be disposed of separatelyi this cannot be done at present because the lane to be widened will not take motors* The widening of this lane may in fact enhance the value of the property, which is an additional reason for not trying to dispose of it at the present time* 9* I anticipate that if my suggestion is adopted it will be necessary to retain the services of the Armenian clerk, two ghulams and one or even two gardeners* The clerk will be required to keep a general eye upon the property, to receive and forward to the Consul at Hhiraz such documents as visa applications and 1 assist in the payment of the numerous Indo- mropean Telegrap h Department£40* £300. £2500. tn 0 Department pensions. The ghulaas will 5e required for message# and as gate-keepers and watchmen, and two gardeners will he indispensable if the water supply is to he properly supervised and the property is not to lose its amenities and in consequence such value as it possesses. It will, in addition, be necessary to make provision for upkeep of roofs, walls etcetera and to moke the Consul at Shiraz a standing travelling allowance of say Forty Founds a year. The total cost, including the travel ling allowance, should he well under Three Hundred Pounds a year and compared to the present cost of the Consulate-General of some Two Thousand Five Hundred Founds a year, this figure is, I submit, very low for the advantages to he gained. 10. I should mention here that I advocate the incorporation of Isfahan with Shiraz rather than the Incorporation of Shiras with Isfahan because Shiraz is not only the more remote post, hut the centre of greater potential political activity. It has also upon the whole the better climate and the Consular residenc is smaller and therefore more convenient for an officer below the rank of Consul-General. Its main drawback is that the foreign coifimunity is somewhat restricted compared to Isfahan. 11. If the amalgamation takes place it will no longer bo possible, in view of the Persian regulations, to call the Isfahan property a 'Consulate-General' or 'Consulate'. It will have to be regarded as a Consular rest-house and the clerk either as a private person with no official status or else ao a clerk of the Shiraz Consulate on detached duty. The position j will be practically the same as that at Bender Abbas as described in my despatch Ho# 360 of August 20th last. 12.

''T ^33 &amp;&gt;) Km (jtuw. Kd-cA-Jfe' i f.'i' Please refer to hoere’a despatch Ro.464 of Ibth Noveiaber 1932 to the Foreign Office on the subject of the amalgamation of the Ispahan and Shiraz Consulates. ■'-I? 2 On general principles Hoare* s suggestion follows what I advocated in paragraph 2 of my demi-official letter Ho.491-3 of 3rd ruguat 1931 to Uscoe; i.e., that ' in these days of improved facilities for travel in Persia, by car and air, there could be fewer Consuls with larger districts provided, they were given sufficient travelling allowance funds for getting about.” The same principle has been adopted in teles coping the Kerman and Bandar Abbas consular areas. In detail, however, Hoare’s proposal goes against my views, and if adopted by His Majesty’s Government will effectively prevent these views being put into practice. My ideas, as put forward in my demi-official letter quoted above, and also in my demi-official letter Ho.bB7-B of 8 th September 1931 to Biscoe, can be summarised as follows. (a) The present state of law and order in Persia is probably ephemeral and when hezn ubah dies, or falls from power, Persia will be once more plunged into a state of unrest and weak government, more especially in the South which even now .... H h • &lt; «A«F«Metcalfe , .£&lt;8n* ,C.X.ii*. ,M. v .O., Officiating Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, Hew Delhi.now is less under control ttian the l orth. (Por an appreciation of what may happen in Persia when the debacle comes see xay ^ote sent to Howell under my demi-official letter fco*69l«3 H of 17th October 1931, with copy to Laithwaite.) (b) It is in the South that the Government of India are especially interested and when the crash comes it will be an undoubted advantage to the Government of India that their representative at Bushi re* who will look at things from their point of view, should have as wide a consular control as possible. My suggestions to this effect are contained in &lt; ' n '~ 1 1i paragraph 5 of my demi-official letter ho.491-3. p ^ I •' '' / ; (c) There is little or no consular work at Shiraz, less than Ispahan I should say, and our interests there could well be looked after by a Consular Agent - a responsible Indian official of the Kh&amp;n Bahadur status. If this were done Shiraz will automatically come under Bushire lparagraph 9 of my demi-official letter Bo.587 -5). f f id) If Hoare’s suggestion is adopted then there will be stationed a Levant Consular officer at Shiraz who will come, not under Bushire, but directly under Tehran. My personal relations with Hoare, who seems to me a sound man, are most cordial, and we see eye to eye in many matters, but - especially at a critical juncture - from the point of view of the Government of India there is a distinct diff erence between their representative at Bushire having a Consular Agent at Shiraz directly under his orders, and their being at Shirrz a dJonsular officer not under his orders. ( e) In times of serious unrest in the past the positi on .«.~ 3- position of a British Consul in the interior of Persia far from inrax bein b a source of strength to Government, has often been one of embarrassment, especially in Shiraz as I see from a perusal of the old Residency files* Sooner or later the question of the Consul*s safety, and of his withdrawal, arises* To withdraw a British officer is a serious step involving a distinct blow to British prestige! to withdraw a Consulrr Agent is comparatively easy and innocuous. (f) There is a further argument in favour of a Consular Agent at Shiraz: while he could use the Consulate as his office he would not reside in it* An official of the Khan Bahadur status could find suitable accommodation in the town - ns indeed does the present Pro-Consul Khan Bahadur Abdul Ahad* This would leave the Consulate free as summer quarters for the Resident’s recess - for which purpose incidentally it was originally built. At present while all other British officers in the Gulf proceed on hot-weather recess, the unfortunate Resident and his staff rexaain in Bushire because they have no accommodation in Shiraz, where officially they are supposed to ^o on recess. (lou will find letters from Biacoe on this subject on your files). Ab Honre points out»some expense will have to be incurred in keeping up the Ispahan Consulate* This expense will presum ably only serve the purpose of housing the Consul Shiraz on his occasional visits* The same expense incurred for Shiraz will provide not only for occasional visits of the Resident-in his consular capacity, but also for providing him with summer recess quarters* As the Shiraz Consulate was built and is kept in repair by Government of India funds, and as the officers •••officers at Bushire are Government of India official* this argument would seem to fee a strong one in the xicinds ol the Government of India. lg) 3hiraz too - from the tribal-political point of view - is definitely in the Bushire area, and only some 170 miles from it by road, much nearer as the crow or aeroplane flies. Ispahan on the other hand is about 500 miles by road from Shiraz. For the purpose of Cbnsular visits therefore Shirsz is considerably nearer Bushire than Ispahan is to Shiraz Ispahan too is a centre for dealing with the Bakhtifrri tribes, and in case of unrest would need some British official rno t or less permanently on the spot. It also, as no? re admits paragraph 10 of his letter - lias a larger foreign community. 4 # x have referred throughout to the officer at Busnire being Resident, but even when am if the Residency is trans ferred elsewhere, there will still be an officer of the Govern- ment of India in Bushire who,from the point of view of the Government of India,should in my opinion have an extensive consular area ( vide paragraphs 5-8 of my demi-official letter Ro.491-3), and who equally should have quarters in ohiraz for his summer recess. X do not see my way to butting in on the question officially for the moment, but perhaps my views as given above may be of interest to you. I am sending a copy of this to Laithw&amp;ite.

As Minister points out, there are some restrictions of a not very serious nature imposed by the Persian Govern ment on the amalgamation. These, however, will probably adjust themselves in practice. A more important point is the possibility of the Consul not being able to fly his flag at Bandar Abbs a. Nonnally he will be there for some five or six months of the year, during the Winter, and for that period will be carrying out his consular duties. It would be distinctly preferable therefore if he could fly his flag» I imagine, however, from whet Minister says, that Persian Government would be within their ri^its to refuse this Concession 1 , and the action he proposes to take appears to be the only one to meet the case. For the Consul to start flying his flag, and then for the Persian Government to reouest that he should cease to do so, would obviously be inadvisgbl e.

Sir c I have the honour to refer to my despatch ho. 188 of the 14th April last and to state that I have now ascertained privately the views of the Persian Government on the question of the amalgamation of the British Consulates at Kerman and Bander Abhas. 2 . I enclose a copy of a record of a conversation between a member of my staff and Farrukh Khan Braghon, the Kesd of the protocol Department of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, from which it will appear that, subject to various trifling restrictions many of which may be expected to dis appear in practice once the new arrangement is working, the Persian Government are prepared to agree to the amalgamation of the posts. 3. one further point remains. It is quits probable that the Persian Government will be unwilling that the Consul ahull fly his flag when in residence at Bander Abbas (if Kerman is his titular post). Subject to your approval I would propose to enquire their views informally and not to press the point if they object. 4. should it now be decided that the amalgamation of the two posts is desirable I should be glad to receive authority itio . 360* The Btght Honourable Sir John Simon G.C.S.I., etc., stc., etc., The Foreign Office.authority to coae to an agreement officially with the Persian Government on the lines suggested by Farrukh Khan. 5 . I have addressed an identic despatch to the Government of India, {Ho. 167), and have sent copies to the Honourable the political Resident in the Persian Gulf (Mo. 1&amp;0), and to the Acting British Consul at Kerman (Mo. 13). I have the honour to be with the highest respect, Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant, (Signed) R.H.HoareRecord of interview between Mr. L.Baggallay and Mirza Farrukh Khan Bragbon on the 11th August 1932. I discussed this question with Farrukh Khan yesterday. i , t 1 ion 4 . a ,? 1 understand it is this •- Our consul at Kerman has Bander Abbas and possibly some other provinces independent of the Governor-General of Kerman in his Consular district. His official residence is Kerman aid most of his official communications will be aldressed to the Governor-General there. But it is open to him if he wishes to do so to address the Governor of Bandar Abbas direct on some matter arising at Bandar Abbas. He should do so as the Consul for Kerman, with the heading 'British consulate, Kerman' on the notepaper. The reply would arrive in due course through the Governor-General of Kerman. This would not mean that the Consul had done wrong to address the Governor of Bander Abbas direct, but would merely be in accordance with the rule that though outlying Governors may receive communications from the Consul in whose district their province lies, and deal with th® in order to save time, the reply to the Consul must always go throug.i the Governor of his place of residence. For a few months in the year the Consul might go down to stay at Bandar Abbas. While there he would still be Consul at Kerman, and whether he addressed the Governor-General of Kerman or the Govern nor of Bandar Abbas while there, he should do so in that capacity and on notepaper headed 'British Consulate,Kerman'. i&gt;arrukh admitted that at this point a slight difficulty would arise, as there would obviously be much unnecessary delay if the reply to a communication to the Governor of Bandar Abbas had to go up to Kerman and be sent back to the Consul from there. He thought that this could be got round by the Governor telling the Consul unofficially what he had said in his reply sent4 - 2 - sent through the Governor-General. (In practice it would probably be possible to arrange for the Governor to give the Consul privately a copy of his reply, but most of the Consul*s coranmnications during the few months he is at Bandar Abbas annually could themselves probably be made privately). The Consulate building at Bandar Abbas would of course cease to be a H Consulate n and be merely a rest-house or anything else we liked to call it. As for the Clerk at Bandar Abbas, Consular clerks had in no case any Recognition', so that It would be no concern of the Persian Government if we chose to retain a man there to attend to our own private affairs. Farrukh saw no reason why the man should not consult the local authorities in a purely private capacity. The local authorities would be sure, he said, to ask, as they always did, what they were to 'do about it', and the Ministry would reply that they saw no harm in their having private and unofficial communications with the clerk. The clerk could not, of course, perform Consular functions like passport and visa work (he can’t from the British point of view either), but there would be no objection to his helping people to fill up their papers and forwarding the papers to Kerman. As regards the notifications of ship’s visits, Farrukh suggested that a number of blank forms made out in the name of the Consul at Kerman should be left with the clerk, who would merely have to fill in the name of the ship whose visit was being announced and send it to the Governor, who would 'thinfc' that; it had come from Kerman. Ti.B • 12.8.1932.r British Lcgation f Tehran* April 14th. 1932. Sir, vihen Lieutenant—Colonel Barrett recently passed, through Tehran on the conclusion of his tour of inspection of His Majesty’s Consulates in south-east Persia, he expressed the opinion in conversation with laemhers of my staff that the present arrangement whereby a single officer acts both as Consul at Kerman and Vice-Consul at Bander Abbas (the present occupant has the personal rank of Consul) was practical and economical. With this opinion I am disposed, upon the information available to me, to agree. 2* His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India will doubtless postpone a decision on this point until they receive Colonel Barrett *b report upon his tour, but as the Persian Government have recently raised objection to Mr. Richardson while Vice-Consul at Bander Abbas, being concurrent* ly Acting Consul at Kerman, I have been obliged to discuss with them in a tentative manner the question of amalgamating the two posts. To this in principle they hove no objection, their point of view being, so far as 1 can gather, that while a Consul cannot have the two posts he may shift his headqu&amp;rt* ers from one place to another within his district. I enclose copies of correspondence with the Ministry in which the positlQ is developed more fully. S. It is possible that when the Persian Government come to examine the proposal in detail they will raise difficulties over The Right Honourable Sir John Simon, G. C. S. I., etc., etc., etc., The Foreign Office.otcp the fact that the new district will comprise not two or aohe complete governorates-general or gorerooratea, but one governorate-general and a section of another governorate (*•••» that ol* the Gulf Porta) f the remainder of which ie in the district of another Consular officer (His Majesty*a Consul-General at Bushire)* Similarly, difficulties may arise when next an Exequatur is sought for His Majesty’s Consul-General at Bushire if the district is described as 'The Coasts ana Islands of the Persian Gulf being within the dominions of Persia'. This description overlaps with the existing description of the Bander Abbas Consular district which is, according to the Foreign Office List the 'District of Bander Abbas up to the Khamir Boundary, the Districts of Shamilat and Einab, end the islands of Hormuz, LaraJc,- Kishm and Henjam'. The Persian Government would probably notice and object to the discrepancy. It will therefore be desirable to consider, at a later stage, how to avoid a discussion of this point. 4. As I have not yet received your instructions upon my despatch Ho. 29 of January 16th regarding Commissions and Exequaturs I have couched ay enquiry in rather vague language. 5.

Foreign, Simla ENCLOSURE IN ' INDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY'S ■D.O. No. D.2514-N/32. Foreign and Political Department, Simla Ttie /' Septremb-Bg ,1932. My dear Daly, Please refer to your telegram No. 245, dated the 24tti June 1932, asking whether the G-overnment of India, wish the comMnation of Sis tan and Meshed Consulates to 5e made permanent. You state that Barrett considers it advisable and that you foresee a practicable scheme resulting in great economy. You will no doubt remember that when you came to Delhi in December, 1930 Sir Bvelyn Howell showed you some files in which two projects had been suggested: (a) by Haworth that the Sis tan Consulate should be reduced or replaced by a Consular Agent, and (b) that it should be transferred to Zahidan. A The first proposal was hotly opposed both by the Minister of the time in Tehran and by the outgoing Consul at Sis tan and it does not seem to have been pursued any further. The second proposal made by Skrine was also strangled at birth on account of the uncertainty as to the future of the Duzdap Bailway. 2. I gather from your note on our file that you were in December, 1930 opposed to making any changes owing to the uncertainty of affairs in Persia. So far as we are aware the prospects of stability in Persia are no greater than they were in 1930. I also see that Barrett as recently as 30th March 1932, stated in his letter, No. 325/127/10, dated/in para. 11 that it was the considered opinion of himself and of you that in ce rtain contingencies the Province of Sis tan would be develpped and would attract Indian trade and capital. I presume that in those circumstances the presence of a BritishBritish Consul at Sis tan would 'be more than ever desirable* Barrett went on to say that in the opposite contingency it would he necessary to reoccupy the Sis tan Consulate, if it had already heen abandoned• The net result of all this would seem to be that both you and Barrett were three months ago convinced that the Sis tan Consulate should be retained. In spite therefore of the great need for economy, we find it difficult to commit ourselves without further explanation to any policy, which involves the disappearance of the Sistan Consulate. 3. I am sending a copy of this letter to His. Majesty’s Minister at Tehran. Yours sincerely, 3d/- H.A.F. Metcalfe. To Major C. K. Daly, C.I.E., H.M.’s Consul for Sistan and Kain, Meshed.QONFIDaHTIAL. D. C. 11/1932. British Consulate-General, Mes tiai. 16/7/32. Dear Metcalfe, Please refer to your D.O. D.2514-N/32 of July 2nd. I am afraid that my telegram 245 did not make the matter clear. The proposal which emanated from Barrett, and which we discussed 'before his departure, does not, in any way, conflict with our opinions previously expressed. It does not involve any alteration in our representation in Sis tan and Kain. Briefly the situation now is, that an expensive senior officer, designated Consul-General, has hitherto ■been appointed to Mes had and has an expensive staff. The work this officer now has to do is less responsible, and leas in quantity, than that contended with by our Vice- Consul at Zahidan. Nov/ at the busiest time of the year in Mes had, the work to oe done is not more than l/5th of that v/hich concerns Sis tan and Kain, and is mostly of a purely routine nature. Consul Sis tan spends 5/6 months annually at Sis tan (Zabul) and 7/6 months at Birjand. Winter is the busy season at Zabul and Zahidan, whereas nothing then happens at Meshad. Meshad work is almost entirely concerned with the pilgrimage in the summer months. The proposal is, briefly, that one officer could supervise both Meshad and Sis tan - as I am at the moment doing living at Zabul in winter and Meshad in summer with a short stay at Birjand when moving, in order to maintain relations with the Notables there, which is important in view of possible changes in Persia in the futurefuture This scheme would permit of ccnsiaera'ble curtailment of staff at Meshad and great economy in other directions amounting prohatly to as much as 3C$ / 40# of the combined budgets of Meshad and Sis tan as they stand now. I am in communication with His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran on the matter, and should he approve of the scheme, in general, I propose to discuss the details when I visit Tehran later, after which a detailed plan would be made out. The object of this D.C. is only to make it clear that the proposals would ensure great reduction in expenditure at Meshad, but involve no changes at Sis tan. Yours sincerely, Sd/- C.K.Daly Mr. H.A.F.

It appears from your telegram No.55 of the 1st August that there may 'be technical difficulties a'bout the proposed amalgamation and there were also administrative difficulties from our point of view, since we were anxious to place Eae at Meshed, vide our telegram No. 43-T. of 5th August 1932. That arrangement seemed to involve Daly either remaining at Sistan or in cas^of amalgamation 'being moved elsewhere and ther^is not at present any appointment in Persia or elsewhere for which he seems to 'be suitable. Leaving cuir these considerations there certainly seems to 'be great deal to he said for Daly’s proposals on the score of economy and a fresh development has now occurred, namely, that ^ae owing to a domestic 'bereavement wishes to proceed on leave at once pending retirement and will not therefore he available for * Meshed. ^Te have another candidate in Thoms on-Glover, hut are nor yet certain w r hether he can he spared in October, ^ from the North West Frontier Province. If he is not available Daly will have to continue at least, as a temporary arrangement, to hold double charge and the question ^ j of permanent arrangements can then he discussed by him with you when he visits Tehran in the autumn. Our general attitude towards the proposal may he summarised as follows: Provided you and Daly are satisfied 'with the arrangement is a good one from the administrative point of view and will he accepted by the Persian Government we should welcome it onit on grounds of economy. On the other hand, it may 'be inconvenient to us to give permanent effect to the proposal at once, if it involves displacing Daly from Sistan* This objection will disappear if, a s is possible, w © are unable to find another more senior officer to undei oalfs the aouble charge* I will telegraph to you about Thomson-G-lover as soon as I know whether he will be available in October.

At j 4^, Mjl+JL CONFIDrNTI A.L. ^——.i ■ ■ ■ —— . mm— m—m + x • ' I t 0 QE Letter from His Britannic Majesty’s Consul General and Agent of the Government of India in Khorasan, Meshed, No. 325/127/10, dated the 30th March 1932. In compliance with the directions contained in your telegram of 6th February 1932, repeated to the Minister at Tehran under No. 5-T., I left Meshed on 1st March and after visiting Sistan, Zahedan, Kerman, Isfahan and Tehran returned to Meshed in the evening of 21st March. 2. While at Sistan I considered the proposal contained in paragraph 4 of Government of India letter No. 369-N./31 of 19th November 1931, in consulta tion with Major Daly. 3. The arguments in favour of the move of the Sistan Consulate to Zahedan and the abolition of the existing Vice-Consulate at that post have been set out in the latter half of paragraph 7 and in paragraphs 8 and 9 of Mr. Skrme’s report No. 2-D., dated the 26th February 1928. My own experience also lends little support to Mr. Shrine’s complaint about the isolation of Sistan being a disadvant age from the administrative point of view. There have been occasions when the officers at Meshed and particularly the officer formerly styled Military Attache Meshed, wished that the Consul superintending the Zahedan post lived in a station on the 'direct line of communication with India. The inconvenience, however, was insignificant and is merely mentioned as part of the general sur\ e\ of the question. 4. The Sistan Consulate buildings and grounds cover an area of 22 acres. The buildings are commodious and give ample accommodation not only to the Consul and his doctor (who is also Vice-Consul) but to all the Consular Staff and to the Hospital. The extensive buildings some of which are brick faced but all are mud built and of that domed roof structure, so common in East Persia, need constant repair, to keep them serviceable, but the actual cost of repair is not very heavy. The amount spent on both the Zabnl (Sistan) and the Birjand Consulates is only Ks. 1,000 annually. 5. I understand from Major Daly that with the exception of the British Consulate ground the whole of the Sistan district is Crown land, and that freehold does not exist In these circumstances it was impossible to get even an approxi mate figure as tie local value of the 22 acres of Government of India land. I raised this point with the intention of getting some idea of the financial effect of selling the Sistan Consulate and purchasing an equivalent area at Zahedan. 6 I understand, however, that an offer for the Sistan Consulate, e'\ en if any were forthcoming, which is extremely doubtful, would be an infinitesimal ^ pio- portion of the amount the Government of India has spent on it. The question of the immediate sale of the Sistan Consulate and grounds does not arise at present however for Mr. Skrine has recommended in paragraph 12 of bis report that an Indian Vice-Consul should be posted at Sistan, where the hospital is to remain. If an Indian Vice-Consul and the hospital are to remain at Sistan and the Consul is expected to spend 2 months each year at Zabul it would be necessary to retain the existing grounds and building for their occupation, and thei e would be no saving on cost of upkeep. The question of subordinate staff required by the Consul and the proposed Indian Vice-Consul will be discussed later. 7. Mr. Skrine mentions that if the British leave ^ Sistan the Russians will probablv leave it too. As a matter of fact the Russians did not wait for the British initiative but withdrew their Consul several months ago. Major Daly informs me that in 1930, he proposed as a measure of economy that the status of the post of medical officer and Vice-Consul at Sistan should be reduced and that a Senior Assistant Surgeon should hold it for the future. In the course of the ensuing correspondence the London Foreign Office raised objection on the ground that so far from the temporary closing of the Russian Consulate being regarded as a reason for reducing the status of the establishment, eveiy effort should be made to profit by this and to increase British influence and prestige in Sistan. MC76FD. enclosure in f | INDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY 8 i Letter No I Dated 7 WAY. 1932 Reoeivea 19 MAY-g. Tn paragraphs 8 and 9 Mr. Skrine mentions the points in favour of Zahedan.. Although events in July 1931, removed Zahedan from the Indian Ra ‘ ^ it is still the headquarters of the Persian Customs admmstration m the bouth Eastern area, and all legitimate land trade from India with has_topa8 through its Customs House. It is probable that the Persian Co\ einm extremely reluctant, at present, to permit trade to follow any ofe route but the possibility of a change must be considered. In the course of cimversatmn y ith the Governor General of Khorasan and Sistan His Excellency has frequently mentioned to me the keen interest which His Majesty the ^ahtekesrn Sistan and His Maicsty’s intention to proceed with the development of that fertile a, granting proprietary rights to the tenants, by regulating the water supply and above all by opening out the country by means of made roads I found that Major Daly heard of the same developments and had been told by His Majesty the Shah himself that the next time he visited Sistan it would be by made road or by railway. The plan for the development of communications has not yet assumed final form. One scheme is to continue the Zahedan railway, if and when it should re-open, as far as Zabul and then connect Zabul with Shusp, Birjand and Meshed For this plan it is understood the co-operation of the .North Wes tern Railway would be sought, and although there are objections to continuing the Indian broad gauge system to Zabul, it is presumed that no objection would be made if the Persians built the continuation on a different gauge An alter native plan would be to link Zabul with the railway by a good made road. In either case the development of Sistan would be materially assisted. To further this development the Persian Government would divert through the province the whole of the northward bound trade by the simple expedient of refusing to repair the existing Zahedan Shusp road, which, as I found by bitter personal experience during my tour, would speedily be cut up and rendered impassable by the winter and spring rains. 9 Another plan, of which I had heard in Meshed is to develop trade between India and North Persia by means of a Decanville railway running direct from Zahedan to Shusp. In view of the Shah’s known desire to develop Sistan, however, this plan is less likely to materialise than either of the others Major Daly has heard of yet another plan which is to connect Sistan with Kandahar by road. The Afghans are said to have undertaken to examine this proposal. 10. I had sounded the Governor General as to his ideas about the British position in Sistan and I found that although he had no views as to the exact nature of that representation Consulate, Vice-Consulate or Consular Agency he was not at all anxious that the British Government should he entirely unrepresented in Sistan He stressed that the province should gam rapidly m wealth and trade m the near future, and he stated that the British Hospital which appears to be the cnly establishment of the kind in that area, was of value to the Persians. In the circumstances, as so often happens in Beis’a, the situation appears again to have changed, and the views expressed by Mr. Skrine m 19-8 [see paragraphs 3 and 4 (4) ] of his report shows signs of being out of date. It is possible, how ever. that 1936 may show a reversion to the 1928 position. 1 may mention that it has hitherto been considered that the preservation of our position in Sistan has certain very definite military advantages, as the pro vince is the only large fertile area on the line of advance between Russian and Indian territory. I will not, however, dilate on this question, about which the Government of India is much better infoimed than I am. H The considered opinion of Major Daly and myself is that if the present Shah should survive long enough the province of Sistan wdll be developed and will attract Indian trade and capital. If, unfortunately His Majesty should share the fate of so many of his predecessors, before his son has grown up and the dynasty has had time to become firmly established, there may be a reversion to old time conditions which would compel renewed British Indian interest in Sistan, as an area bordering on India and Afghanistan. This interest would render the reoccupation of the Sistan Consulate unavoidable. 12 I will now consider the second part of my instructions as regards Sis tan. In this matter it must be remembered that measures of economy have been3 undertaken by Major Italy since October last and that most of tbe possible re ductions have already been made by him. All allusions hereafter made to the printed Budget or Estimates refer to the “Statement” showing the detailed distribution of the Appropriatkn under “ 29— Political” for 1931-32. 13. I will consider alternative B of your instructions first and submit pro posals on the assumption that existing arrangements are to be allowed to continue. Omitting pay of officers the budget of the Sistan Consulate for 1930-31, showed a total expenditure of Rs. 80,600 which was reduced in the revised estimate to Rs. 75,100. The budget for 1931-32 showed a further reduction to Rs. 68,000., These reductions were made in spite of the increased cost of imported articles, such as uniform and equipment caused by the enormous customs duties levied by the Persian Government in recent years. The reductions have been helped- however, by the fall in the value of Persian currency and the consequent cheapen, ing of all services paid in that currency. At the present moment therefore it is very desirable that payments should be made as far as possible in local currency and not in rupees. The budget estimate for 1931-32 shows 4 clerks (at rates varying from Rs. 100 to Rs. 250) (S. P. 15—25) but the pay should be Rs. 15,276 (average cost) and not 8,700 plus 700 revision of pay as shown. The difference is due to increments of pay and a considerable increase of pay due to the Sistan establishment being brought on the Persian Gulf scale. Of these posts that of Head Clerk (Pay Rs. 250—10—300, average pay Rs. 289-15-0 special pay 50 and Customs Compensatory Allowance Rs. 25) can be abolished, thereby reducing future expenditure by Rs. 4,380 per annum. The post of Trade Agent has been abolished during the current year and the pay of Rs. 1,300 budgetted on this account can be cut out, but the special pay to wireless operator should continue. Of the 12 Dak and postal sowars, 3 sowars at Rs. 20 each can come under reduction making a total saving of Rs. 720 per annum. No reduction is recommended in the pay of the 2 Sub-Assistant Surgeons but certain adjustments are made in their allow ances whereby the total disbursements on this account are considerably reduced. The post of one Compounder and Dresser can be abolished thereby saving Rs. 400. The Telegraph establishment can be dispensed with. A reduction of Escort charges is possible by reducing the number of escort sowars by one. This would save the pay of one man Rs. 432 annually, Tour charges Rs. 50, Fodder, Line gear and replacement of horses Rs. 414 annually 5 Making a small adjustment owing to the pay of a locally engaged sowar being paid in Persian currency the total possible saving under Escort charges is Rs. 1,000 annually. Major Daly while mentioning the reduction of one man entered under the budget heading of Escort charges as a possibility, asks at the same time that this reduction may not be pressed. He stated that the escort have to conduct the annual caravan from Sistan to Birjand a distance of about 275 miles. While at Birjard the Escort sowars carry all the correspondence between the Consul at Kalateh and the Governor and the Vice-Consel at Birjand itself. This involves a daily journey of 11 miles. The Governor of Birjand, who is a hereditary Governor and not an official, is frequently in i evidence at his country house situated 40 miles from Kalateh, and correspondence has to be carried to his residence. In the interests of good relations with tl e local authorities the Consul has every year to accept Shaukat-ul-Mulk s invitation to his private residence. This involves a journey for the Escort sowars of 3, 16 or 45 miles from Headquarters at Kalateh. In the circumstances Major Daly does not consider the existing establishment of sowars excessive and I agree with him. 14. Itisthepresenceof members of the hereditary nobility of Birjand and Kain, who still retain some semblence of their former power, and the lack of security in the wilder parts that differentiates the Sistan and Kain Consulate from other Consulates in 1 ersia. In Khorasan I would not dream of recommending the re tention of special sowars to guard the Consular baggage during an annual move to a cooler climate. Isot only does the Meshed climate render an annual move un necessary but the military and gendarmerie have succeeded for the present at any rate, in establishing and maintaining a state of complete security on the roads. Moreover the local nobility have been reduced to such incompetence that it is neither necessary nor advisable in view of the suspicious character of Government to maintain special relations with them., - Ti ie upkeep of special Dak sowars between Zabedan and Zabul may appear at first sight to be unnecessary, but it will be noted that even Mr. Skrme recommended their retention for political reasons (see paragraph 12 of his report). Major Dalv informs me, that, the country between Zabul and Zahedan outside the im mediate vicinity of the towns, and also part of the country between Zabul and Birjand is occupied by wandering Afghan Baluch tribes, whose predatory inst.ncte have by no means been tamed. The Dak sowars have since the founding of the Consulate been recruited from these trbesmen, and may be regarded as a species of subsidy paid to them for protection and news. The Jemadar in charge is of good status and he and his sowars are invaluable not only for carrying the mail, but for bringing news of local happenings and for the protection of British and Indian travellers It is notable that whereas the Persian mail is occasionally looted and Persian travellers benighted on the dreadful roads of the country are molested, the British mail runs regularly to time and British subjects receive complete immunity •fTnm mnl pr+.d tion at the hands of the tribesmen. 16. In the ease of the subordinate medical establishment Major Daly recom mends the abolition of the Sumptuary Allowance of R-s. 15 paid to the Sub-Assis tant Surgeon, Sistan, while the Sumptuary Allowance paid to the Sub-As S1 stant Surgeon and Vice-Consul, Birjand, is continued as before at Rs. 10 per mensem. This will make a small saving under C. 3 “ Sumptuary Allowance . The Vice-Consul Birjand, has hitherto drawn a conveyance Allowance of Rs. 30. Major Daly considers that this should now cease. A saying of Rs. 360 per annum will result Major Daly also recommends a reduction from Rs. 100 to Rs. 50 in the allowance paid to the Sub-Assistant Surgeon, Birjand, for performing the duties of Vice-Consul, Birjand. A saving of Rs. 9C0 per annum under C. 3. House rent and other allowances should result from these two economies. The Sub-Assistant Surgeon at Sistan and the Sub-Assistant Surgeon and Vice- Consul at Birjand have hitherto drawn special pay at Rs. 50 and Rs. 70, respective- ly Major Daly considers that the special pay at Sistan should be abloished and that at Birjand a reduction to Rs. 50 should be made. This would mean a saving of Rs. 840 annually under C. 2, Sub-Assistant Surgeon. 17 I am not aware of the extent or the responsibility of the duties that the Sub-Assistant Surgeon and Vice-Consul at Birjand is called upon to perform, so I accept Major Daly’s figures, though I understood at Tehran that there is a feeling at the Legation that he is perhaps being called upon to make unduly heavy sacrifices. 18 The new scale of expenditure recommended under Sirvtan m the event of existing arrangements being allowed to continue compared with the establishment existing on 1st October 1931 before the commencement of recent reductions is shown in Statement A. A comment that can be made when comparing the Sistan clerical establishment with that of other Indian Political Consulates in Persia, is that nowhere else is there a highly paid Confidential Extra Assistant in addition to a highly paid Attache. Major Daly explained that the Confidential Assistant is necessary owing to the large amount of confidential telegraphic and written correspondence with Tehran, Balu chistan and the Government of India. Duzdap Railway matters and frontier inci dents give rise to much confidential correspondence which does not exist m posts more remote from the Indian frontier. The record of confidential letters and telegrams issued and received shows figures much in excess of other Consulates and I understand that more confidential work reaches the Legation from Sistan than any other Consulate in Persia with the exception of Bushire. In the circumstances a Confidential Assistant appears to be a justifiable expense. Another matter which attracts attention is why the Attache at Sistan, who draws the same salary, should be a non-gazetted officer while attaches in other Consulates hold gazetted rank. 19. In the case of Zahedan the budget estimate for 1931-32 shows one Trade Assistant at Rs. 4,800 annually under Account I. B. i (page 15) and also 2 clerks on Rs. 2,200 and 4 servants drawing 1,700. The Trade Assistant has responsible duties to perfom, and it is proposed to retain the post. His establishment has however already been reduced by one clerk and one servant and it is now suggcsdteby Major Daly that the post of the second clerk and another servant should be abolished. This after allowing for Customs compensation allowance and com pensation allowance drawn by the clerks will result in a saving of Its. 2.700 annually in the case of the clerks while the servants will cost in future Its. 850 per annum paid from Office allowance instead of its. 1,700, being a saving of Its. 850 annually. 20. I have made enquiries as to the duties performed by the Trade Assistant at Zahedan and I find that they are very similar to those of the Attache at Meshed. The Attache at Meshed has no clerk, and all clerical work is either performed by himself or done for him by the clerks in the Oeneral Office. I agree with Major Daly therefore that it is waste of money to provide the Trade Assistant with separate clerical assistance. 21. On page 30 pf the estimates under C. 2.—Pay of Establishment 3 Trade Assistant and clerks are shown drawing Rs. 5,800. The Trade Assistant here referred to is the Trade Agent, whose post has already been abolished as a measure of economy thereby saving Rs. 1,392 (average cost) annually. The post appears to have been entered twice, once under Sistan and again under Duzdap (Zahedan). Major Daly has arranged that his duties should be performed by the Sub- Assistant Surgeon stationed at Zahedan who is given an allowance of Rs. 30 per mensem. This is an economical arrangement which appears to be working J satisfactorily. The Rs. 5,800 shown as the cost of 3 Trade Assistant and clerks can now be reduced to Rs. 4,400 for 2 clerks. I have no remarks to make about ser vants and orderlies. One Sub-Assistant Surgeon is shown as drawing Rs. 1,200 annually. This figure is incorrect if either average pay or actuals are considered. In the former case the correct figure including special pay and clothing allowance is Rs. 1,464 and in the latter case Rs. 1,524. The Sub-Assistant Surgeon also draws Rs. 300 annually as Customs compensation allowance and is now being given an allowance of Rs. 360 annually for performing the duties of Trade or Forwarding Agent. 22. The 2 posts of Compounder and Dresser have been abolished whereby a saving of Rs. 800 annually results. The Rs. 3,700 annually shown as spent on Vice Consulate guards is correct. It will now be reduced to Rs. 2,700 consequent on the reduction of 2 men. House rent and other allowances will have to be in creased by Rs. 360 annually consequent on the allowance granted to the sub- Assistant Surgeon for performing the duties of Trade and Forwarding Agent. 23. All possible economies appear to have been made at Zahedan. It is neces sary to have some sort of medical assistance on the spot and this is provided by the Sub-Assistant Surgeon, whom it has been possible to deprive of Compounder and Dresser by relieving him of all duties connected with Zahedan town. The Zahedan Vice Consulate which covers a large area of desert land is situated at some distance from the town and it is made up of a number of separate small houses. It is freed from the danger of raids by the close proximity of the Persian Military barracks, but this proximity renders it peculiarly liable to petty pilfering, British Govern ment property situated at Zahedan requires protection in the circumstances and I am satisfied that the reduction of 2 guards is as much as can be expected. 24. A possible economy that struck me is the amalgamation of the posts of Trade Assistant (not to be confounded with the Trade or Forwarding Agent) and Rebate Officer. The latter is at present a member of the general Persian Gulf and 1 Persian Clerical Service, but he works under the orders of the Indian Customs Service. The amalgamation of the posts would make a saving of about Rs. 4,200 annually, so I referred the matter for the opinion of Major Daly, who has the necessary knowledge of their respective duties. He informs me that he has already fully considered the suggestion and that he is convinced that the amalgamation of the posts is impossible. At the moment the Rebate Officer has little to do but this is solely because, owing to indecision about the Railway, traders are not order ing goods. As soon as a decision has been reached goods will come forward. The Rebate Officer will then have a whole time job as every package has to be seen and identified and the sums involved in drawbacks on goods which have passed in transit through India runs into lakhs of rupees annually. The Indian Customs Department have recently considered the possibility of giving the post of Rebate MC76FD6 Officer to a more experienced man from their own staff, but it has been decided that it should continue to be held by a man who knows Persian and local condi tions. r In the circumstances the immediate amalgamation of the posts of Rebate Officer and Trade Assistant is not recommended but it may be considered in the future but only if and when conditions at Zahedan change. A comparison of expenses at Zahedan before the recent economies were made and as it is hoped they will in the future is made in Appendix B. 25. In the event of the transfer of the Sistan Consulate to Zahedan and the abolition of the existing Zahedan Vice Consulate the economies in comparison with the figure aheady given will he very small. It is presumed that it is the intention of the Government of India to accept Mr. Skrine’s proposal that a Senior Indian Officer should be posted to Sistan as Vice Consul and that the Hospital at that station should be maintained, also that the Consul should reside in the Consulate for 2 months each year. In these circumstances I can see no saving whatever in the cost of upkeep of the Consulate buildings and grounds or in the measures for their protection. The inhabitants of Zabul are reported to be less under control than those of Northern Persia, and if guards are reduced, or the buildings left unoccupied there would be the danger of pillage. It may be argued that a portion of the Consulate grounds might be sold, but I understand that there would be no buyers at present. There is no demand for buildings, built on the grand scale of the Consul’s residence or even for the doctor’s quarters. At present free hold is unknown in Sistan so Major Daly has been unable to quote even an approximate figure for the site. 26. Presuming that the Consul moved to Zahedan and an Indian Vice Consul of Assistant Surgeon’s rank w'ere retained in Sistan to continue the Consular and medical work the posts of Consul and Confidential Assistant shown under C.-l on page 28 of the Budget estimate could be retrenched but there would be a corres ponding increase under Zahedan, so there would be no saving to Government. Under C.-2, two clerks would still be required though the Attache would be trans ferred to Zahedan. The other salaries, whether held by persons continuing to reside at Zabul, Birjand or Zahedan w T ould continue the same, except that some saving under Escort charges would be possible as the “ annual caravan ” from Sistan to Birjand would be discontinued. The Consul’s baggage would presum ably move from Zahedan to Birjand along the well frequented Meshed highway where no special excort is required. A saving of Rs. 1,000 might be claimed on this account. I am here presuming present conditions and not the situation as it may prove to be, after the Shah’s schemes for the development of Sistan have materialised. Under Duzdap Vice Consulate, page 30, C.-l there wandd be a saving of the pay of the Vice Consul but it is presumed that the Consul, who has to supervise a large area would not be tied down to all the routine work at present performed by the Vice Consul. He vrould require an assistant to relieve him of routine and to hold charge in his absence. Zahedan being on the frontier the Consul there has a variety of passport and other work that does not fall to the lot of the Consul at Kerman. To relieve the Consul the present post of attache at Sistan, will have to be transferred to Zahedan with the increased status of a gazetted officer, There wnuld be no saving in the number of the clerks or menial officers, on the contrary Major Daly informs me that he would have to press for the retention of the post of Head Clerk to the Consulate on a salary of Rs. 250—10—300 whose aboltion he has now recommended, but wnuld be willing to release the services of a junior clerk in his place. I think however, that the question of amalgamating the post of the Trade Assistant and the Attache might be considered. If this were done one post on Rs. 4,800 annually with its attached allowances for Customs com pensation could be abolished. It will be seen therefore that apart from the saving in the pay of a Vice Consul and possibly of the Trade Assistant the reduction in expenditure consequent on the move from sistan to Zahedan wnuld be small. 27. There is another aspect of the question to which I think I should refer. In the north of Persia adequate medical attendance is procurable as Persian doctors wdth European qualifications are practising in all the large towns, and in Kerman and Meshed and I believe Isfahan arrangements have been made with the7 Mission Hospitals for attendance on the Consular Staff. In South-East Persia there are no fully qualified Persian or Missionary doctors and the Consular Officers have to rely on their own Consular doctors. The doctor for South-East Persia has hitherto been an I. M. S. Officer stationed in Sistan. If the Consul is moved to Zahedan his doctor should accompany him. The recent death of Major May Somerville at Birjand while en route to Meshed and the serious illness of the Vice Consul, Birjand himself call attention to the necessity of the continuance of skilled medical attendance in the Sistan area. If the Consul is to be accompanied to Zahedan b}^ his doctor it will be necessary to build adequate accommodation for him and building at Zahedan is very expensive. Moreover the army huts which at present inadequately liouse the \ ice Consul, who is usually a very junior officer, would not do for the permanent residence of the more senior Consul. I am unable to quote figures to show the cost of building suitable quarters at Zahedan but Major Daly has given me the following figures showing comparative costs in Zabul and Zahedan :— At Zahedan, Krans. At Sistan. Krans, Cooly daily wage ,, H 1 Mason ,. ,, ., »• ,. 14/15 6/8 Apprentice ? • 5/6 3 Unburnt bricks 16 per 1,000 4 per 1,000. Burnt bricks f . 140 per 1,000. 34 per 100. Mud for repair to buildings '• ,. 12 per 100. c. f. Nil. Procur able at site Straw ,. .. 150 per 1,300 Cbs. 12 per 1,300 Cbs. It is obvious that the cost of erecting suitable quarters in Zahedan must be very heavy and that against any financial savings consequent on the move must be placed not only the large capital sunk in houses and the interest on that capital but much increased charges for upkeep of buildings. This question requires much more consideration than is given to it by Mr. Skrine in paragraph 11 of his report. From the point of view of economy the heavy cost of building and of repairs to buildings in Zahedan, is in my opinion the weightiest argument against the move, and would more than wipe out any economies mentioned in my paragraph 26 above' The estimated expenditure in the event of the move of the Consular Headquarters is shown in Appendix C. ^ 28. In the event of its being decided to close down the Sistan Consulate al together and to sell tne land and buildings at Zabul for whatever they may fetch and to dismiss all Dak sowars while retaining some of the present Sistan escort the resulting saving would cover any increased costs in Zahedan, but the main tenance of an Indian Vice Consul at Zabul while transferring of the Headquarters of the Consulate to Zahedan does not strike me as an economical move. 29. Mr, Richardson, who holds the appointment of Consul at Kerman in addition to his duties as Consul at Bandar Abbas had come up to Kerman to meet me and gave me a statement showing the proposed saving at Bandar Abbas and Kerman if the present system of joint charge is allowed to continue. Economies at Bandar Abbas are beyond the sphere of my enquiries, but the statement is interesting and I reproduce it as appendix D, 30. The Kerman Budget estimate for 1931-32 are shown on page 23 of the “ statement ”. I will take the figures seriatim on the assumption that Kerman Consulate will be amalgamated with Bandar Abbas and a Consul of Vice Consul retained for both districts, ~ C. 1. Pay of Officers. 1. Consul .—This is a superior appointment and I am not called upon for comment. r 1. Attache.—I understand that Mr. Richardson has recommended the abo lition of this post, and in view of the small number of British subjects and the small volume of British trade now being carried on in the district I see no objection to8 this course. It may he argued that the Attache is necessary to hold charge during the absence of the Consul in Bandar Abbas, but it appears that the Head Clerk is in a position to perform the work just as efficiently and at much less cost. the importance of Kerman has dwindled to such an extent that the presence of a high paid Attache is no longer necessary. The collection of data for the compilation of political and commercial diaries and for trade reports is I understand from Mr. Richardson entrusted to the Persian Mirza. A good road now connects Ker man and Bandar Abbas and the Persian mail is carried backwards and forwards twice a week, so that communication between the Consul at Bandar Abbas and his Head Clerk in Kerman is easy and rapid. I consider therefore that the post of Attache at Kerman can safely be abolished and a saving of Rs. 5,100 the salary of the present incumbent for the present year thereby be effected. Allowance to Medical Officer Rs. 1,200 should be continued. This sum is paid to a Missionary doctor and is the least sum for which the services of a fully quali fied doctor can be obtained. 31. C.2 Pay of Establishment.— 2 Clerks, 4,500. —The revised figures are 4,700 and I do not recommend any reduction. Escort charges. —The expenditure on this item has gradually been reduced from Rs. 7,400. For 1931-32 it is expected that actual expenditure will be Rs. 5,350. The amount proposed for the year 1932-33 is Rs. 2,340, but there appears to be no reason why any part of the escort should be retained and as Mr. Richardson is willing to do without it I suggest that the escort should be abolished altogether and the whole amount of the grant saved. 32. C. 3. Allowances honoraria, etc, travelling alloivance Rs. 2,400, sumptuary allowance Rs. 2,400. —These items call for no comment. As the Consul will be required to travel between Bandar Abbas and Kerman the amount budgetted for travelling allowance is not excessive. 33. House rent and other allowances 1,700—This figure could be reduced by Rs. 1,200 in the event of the abolition of the post of the Attache who draws this amount. A further Rs. 360 could be saved by making additions and alterations to existing Consulate buildings in order to make them suitable for habitation by the Head Clerk. Customs Compensatory Allowance Rs. 2,500. A saving of Rs. 600 would result from the abolition of the post of the Attache but an addition of Rs. 90 must be made. This figure represents half the Customs Compensation allowance that would be drawn by the proposed junior clerk. 34. C. 6. Compensation for depreciation of Krans Rs. 100. —This figure will be omitted in the future. C. 7. Contingencies Service post and telegram charges can be reduced from Rs. 1,500 to 1,200, and office allowance from 12,220 to 11,500. Registration of immoveable property Rs. 600 appears in the estimate for 1932-33 but as this a non-recurring charge payable to the Persian Government for the registration of Consulate property it seems unnecessry to repeat it. I understand that the Kerman Consulate property was registered in 1931-32. Medical contin gencies have been reduced from Rs. 200 to 150. In addition Rs. 1,000 are received from the Bushire Residency Central Contract Grant for the upkeep of Consular Buildings and Rs. 150 have been given for special repairs to the main gate. These figures are included in the Bushire estimates. 35. With regard to escort charges I have ascertained that there were 3 Indian . sowars and 4 Persian Ghulams employed at the Kerman Consulate. Two of the Indian sowars have already been repatriated while the third has been entertained as Chief Messenger at Rs. 720 per annum. This salary is to be paid out of Office allowance. The 4 Ghulams are being retained as Bicycle orderlies and night watch men but their salary also will be paid from the grant for Office allowance. The special grant of Rs. 7,400 hitherto made for Escort charges is therefore no longer required. 36. I have examined the detail figures for the proposed Office allowance grant, and find that all charges on account of Messengers, Farashes (Chuprasis), Gate keepers, Water camera, Gardeners, sweepers, Toshakhana presents, upkeep of flags, liveries, hot and cold weather charges, travelling allowance to medical establish-ment, Office contingencies and other miscellaneous expenditure have been included under this head. The pay of personnel has quite correctly been changed as far as possible from Foreign into Persian currency, as this is the most economical arrange ment. In the circumstances a grant of Es. 11,500 annually does not appear excessive, although some economies will probably be possible. For instance in present circumstances Es. 1,500 for Toshakhana appears to be excessive. Mr. Eichardson agrees with this view and he will probably find it possible to limit his expenditure from Office allowance to Es. 10,500 or a little less. 37. The establishment recommended for the combined Kerman and Bandar Abbas Consulate is— 1 Head Clerk at Kerman. 1 Superior Grade Persian Munshi at Kerman. 1 Junior clerk to accompany the Consul on tour and to be employed either at Bandar Abbas or Kerman. 1 Clerk and one Munshi at Bandar Abbas. 38. I append a statement E of the present and the proposed establishment at Kerman. In the event of it being decided to maintain a separate Consular Officer at Kerman and at Bandar Abbas, the staff mentioned in paragraph 37 will be required, wdth the exception of the junior clerk to accompany the Consul on tour and to work either at Bandar Abbas or Kerman as required. The saving on this account will be approximately Es. 1,440 for pay and Es. 360 for allowances, gay Es. 1,800 annually of which half is chargeable to Bandar Abbas. 39. The Meshed establishment is shewn cn page 27 of the estimates. Under C.-l no remarks are called for. The Indian Attache who is really a Persian is invaluable for all unofficial dealings with Persian Departments. He also performs all the translation and correspondence work done by a special Persian Mirza in Kerman and Isfahan. It is proposed to retain the post. Fay of eitablislment. —Three Superintendent and Clerks (120—250) S. P. (20— 50) Es. 7,200. The pay of the Superintendent and clerks has been increased since the Budget figures were printed, as the Persian Gulf rates were sanctioned by the Government of India with effect from 1st April 1931. The amount drawn during 1931-32 was actually Es. 8,340. It is proposed as a measure of economy to effect a saving by retrenching the pest of junior clerk as scon as the present incumbent, who is a good clerk and senior of his grade in the Persian Gulf cadre, can be provided for elsewhere. This retrenchment will ultimately mean a saving of Es. 2,040 annually. The amount required for clerks will theieafter be Es. 6,540. Thepostof wireless operate r has been abolished so the whole of the Es. 1,600 shown as his pay will be saved hereafter. C.-3. Allcucnces, Honoraria, etc .— House rent and other alloivcnees Rs. 4,800 .— This figure is now reduced to Es. 3,600 as the second clerk has been given accom modation inside the Consulate and the house rent allowances drawn by him has been discontinued. The allowance of Es. 1,500 drawn by the wireless operator has also been discontinued as the post has been abolished. The travelling allowance of Es. 5,000 annually allotted to this post is normally too high though it has been fully spent, in the past when transfers to India or the Gulf have taken place, its leducticn to Es. 4,000 has been recommended. A considerable saving w-ould have been made even on the lower figure during 1931-32 had not the Consul General been deputed towards the close of the financial year, to inspect various Consulates in Persia. C.-4. Supplies and Services. —Maintenance charge of wireless set atKs. 500. As the set has been closed down there will be no expenditure under thi head in the future. C-6. Compensations. No alteration is required. C.-7. Contingencies. Greater use of the post and the new system of “ saving ” telegrams has permitted considerable economies to be made. It is considered that Es. 2,000 will suffice under this head in the future. Office Allowance Es. 31,300. Considerable econo mies have been made by reducing Staff, getting rid of all horses and employing bicycles instead. The amount spent on Secret Service has also been considerably curtailed. It is anticipated that a sum of Es. 25.000 will be ample to cover ah10 expenses met from Office Allowance in the future unless the Persian exchange should move against India. In Meshed many charges which have been shown under separate heads, in Sistan and Kerman are paid from Office allowance and the Consulate has benefitted from the fixing of salaries in Persian currency and not in rupees as has so frequently been the case in Sistan, Zahedan and Kerman. I append Statement (F) which compares the proposed allotment for Khorasan with that of past year. A further saving, which does not appear in this appendix, is caused by the abolition of the post of the Levant Vice Consul, half of whose pay and allowances were debited to the Government of India. Now that the Clercial establishments in all Consulates, maintained by the Government of India in the Persian Gulf and Persia have been put on one establish ment a point that will need careful watching is the limitation of transfers of Clerks to the absolute minimum. Ihe cost of transfers by road in Persia is very heavy. tt- l am sendin g a C0 Py of ^is report to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran and to His Majesty s Consul for Sistan and Kain.11 APPENDIX A.

Please refer to Sir Robert Clive’s despatch No. 311, dated the 13th June 1931 on the sub ject of reductions in consular establishments in Persia. Copies of this despatch have been sent from here to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, the Consul-General at Meshed and the Consul in Sistan. Such procedure is of course irregular, but it is impossible for the Government of India to consider the proposed reductions in the status of the posts with which they are con cerned without having before them the views of the local officer, who may be in possession of facts not necessarily upon record at the Legation. I hope that in the circumstances Sir Robert’s successor will understand and forgive the irregu larity. Demi-official letter to C. E. S. Dodd, Esq., His Majesty’s Charge d’affaires, Tehran, No. F.-369-N./30, dated the 10th August 1931. Please refer to my letter No. 369-N./30, dated the 4th August 1931. I have already informed you of the action which has been taken here on Sir Robert Clive’s despatch No. 311. The question of reduc tion in the status of various Consular posts neces sarily raises that of reduction in Consular estab lishments. As Sir Robert has himself pointed out those Consulates which are manned by offi cers of the Indian Political Department had their scale of establishment drawn up while the capi tulatory regime was still in force and in the altered conditions of the present time it seems possible that considerable economies might be effacted. The best way to arrive at a proper conclusion on this subject would in the opinion of the Government of India be to depute a senior officer of experience to visit each of~the Consular posts concerned, examine the existing establishments and submit his recommendations simultaneously to His Majesty’s Legation at Tehran and to the Government of India on the assumption— (a) that the reduction in the status of the posts suggested by Sir Robert Clive had been approved ; (&amp;) that no change in status had been made. If in his opinion some change in status other than that proposed by Sir Robert were necessary, he could submit proposals accordingly and state what establishment would be required to give effect to them. Barrett who has shown considerable aptitude for reducing expenditure at Meshed under stress of the existing financial stringency might, it is thought, with advantage be deputed to undertake this duty at Sistan and Kerman as well as Meshed. As regards the remainder of the posts with which the Government of India is connected, it is thought that Biscoe might possibly prefer to undertake the task himself and the option is being put to him. It is of course beyond the province of the Government of India to make any suggestion with regard to the remaining Consulates, but it is thought that if a uniform procedure were adopted throughout Persia, it would probably be justified by the results. As far as the Government of India are concerned extreme financial stringency renders it desirable not only that every possible source of economy be explored but that effect should be given to all reductions proposed as soon as possible. Demi-official letter to Major T. C. W. Fowle, C.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, No. F.-369-N./30, dated the 10th August 1931. Please refer to letter from the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, No. F -369-N./30, dated the 28th July 1931. 11 is of course not usual for a despatch from H. M.’s Minister to be forwarded to Consular officers serving in the country to which he is accredited for their comments. But since there may be local considerations not upon record at the legation which would have an appre ciable bearing upon Sir Robert Clive’s recommen dations, this somewhat unusal course has been taken in this instance. It is also clear to the Government of India that the question of reduc tion in status can scarcely be considered without taking into account its effect on Consular estab lishments. Indeed even where no such reduction has been proposed they ar° inclined to think that existing establishments which date from the days of the cap.tulatory regime may possibly be excessive in the altered circumstances of the present time, and it is accordingly being suggest ed to H. M.’s Charge d’Affaires that Barrett might be deputed to examine Consular establish-' ments in Sistan and Kerman as well as at Meshed and submit reports to the Legation and to the Government of India on the assumption— (a) that the reduction in the status of the posts suggested by Sir Robert Clive had been approved ; (b) that no change in status has to be made, (c) that changps other than those suggested by Sir Robert Clive were desirable. As regards Consular posts other than Kerman under the control of the Political Resi dent in the Persian Gulf the Government of India would be glad to have a similar examina tion carried out, and think that Barrett might be very suitable for the purpose. But his absence from his own charge for the prolonged period which would be entailed might have inconvenient consequences, and it is also possible that Col. Biscoe on return from leave might prefer to do what is required himself. I am to suggest that his views on this point might be ascertained and ’ reported to the Government of India as soon as, possible. It is perhaps unnecessary to remind you that the financial situation in India renders it absolutely essential not only that every means of economy be exploited but that effect be given without delay to all such reductions in establish ments as may on enquiry be found possible.o •J Demi-official letter from Major T.

Demi-official letter from Major T. C. W. V Fowle, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, No. 492-S. of 1931, dated the 3rd August 1931. With reference to Foreign and Political Depart ment letter No. F.-369-N./30, dated the 28th July 1931, I enclose herewith a copy of my demi- official No. 491-S. of today’s date to Colonel Biscoe, without the enclosures thereto. Demi-official letter from Major T. C. W. Fowle, to Lt.-Col. H. V. Biscoe (on leave). No. 491-S. of 1931, dated the 3rd August 1931. I enclose herewith copies of letter No. F.-369-N./ 30 of 28th July 1931, from the Deputy Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, with enclosures. I also enclose an office note on the subject with refer ences to your previous letters and telegrams on the subject, where these have not been repeated to the India Office copies are given, where they have been so repeated you will be able to get copies from the India Office. I hope this is con venient ? It will save the office here extra typing of which they have had a good deal lately, and as you know we are short-handed. 2. I do not propose to go into detail into the Minister’s proposals (though see paragraph 12 below). Information is contained in 'the office note and of course you know all the pros and cons. One thing as a principle might be accepted I think. In these days of improved facilities for travel in Persia, by car and air, there could be fewer Consuls with larger districts provided they were given sufficient Travelling Allowance Funds forgetting about. 3. There are, however, two general considera tions affecting the consular problem in Persia which I should like to touch on. The first is the fact that—in my opinion—the present condition of comparative law and order and strong central government in Persia is purely ephemeral. It depends on the life of one man Reza Shah, and when that man dies, or falls from power—it may be tomorrow, it may be 5 or 10 years hence—Persia will once moie be plunged into her normal state of unrest and weak government, perhaps a little worse than usual on account of various factors. You have touched on the ephemeral nature of the present administration in various of your letters, and the late Minister (Sir Robert Clive) has also hinted at it. Personally I have never met any one in Persia, foreigner or Persian, (though natu rally this is not a subject which one can discuss freely with the latter), who thought there was any real hope of strong government when Reza disappears. In considering what should be our consular representation in Persia, I think we should keep this fact in mind, especially with regard to the proposal made in paragraph 5 below. 4. The other consideration which I have to offer is with regard to the suggested move of the Residency to Bahrain. The present proposal is briefly that when this occurs the Resident will still have the powers of an Inspecting Con sul-General on the Persian side, but these po»ver according to the Foreign Office view amount to very little, and in practice—when the time comes to put them into practice—will, I think person- ally, amount to still less. The whole tone of the principal Foreign Office letter up to date dealing with the matter is unsatisfactory from our point of view. For ready reference I give some quotations from it:— “ R would, however, be impossible for us to agree that the Resident should be solely responsible for issuing instruc tions of a political nature to the Con sular officers in Persian ports. ***** You will of course appreciate that the fact that the Consul-General will no longer actually be resident in Persia and in immediate touch with the Persian local authorities must inevitably mean that in practice, especially in urgent cases, much greater use would be made by the Minister of the Consul at Bushire. ***** As regards section 3 of your letter, it is difficult to estimate the importance to the fact that an Inspecting Consul- General would have no standing vis-a- vis the local authorities. It is con ceivable that the local authorities might refuse to have any dealings with him.as he will have no exequatur from the Persian Government, but, on the other hand, there seems no very great dis advantages in his having to approach the Persian authorities through the proper channel, i.e., the local British Consul.” 5. I may be wrong but what I am afraid will happen is that the Resident while holding the shadow in the shape of being Inspecting Consul- General for the Persian Gulf Torts, will lose the substance of any real influence on the Persian side. I venture to suggest that it might be as well to accept this unpleasant fact, but to endea vour to balance it to so ne extent by making the following proposal. The Consular officer at Bushire should be of Consul-General rank, (the Minister’s scheme allows for a Consul or Consul- General), should be an officer of the Indian Political Department, (this I am under the impression the Foreign Office are prepared to accept), and his exequatur—as it did more or less in the days of Sir Percy Cox—should cover the whole of the Persian coast from Moham- merah to the Indian frontier including Aiiwaz and Shiraz, but excluding Kerman, which is not in the Gulf area at all and which should be surrendered to the Foreign Office. 6. The incumbent of the post (Consul-General, Bushire), though he would have to be a fairly senior officer would be junior to the Resident at Bahrain, and it would be understood that in cases where Gulf matters in general, both Persian and Arab sides, were concerned, he should work in with the Political Resident. It is true that by this arrangement the shadow of the Inspector Generalship would be lost, but the substance in the shapa of Government of India influence on the Persian side would be retained, and the Political Resident working with an officer of hD own Department (the Consul-Gene ral at Bushire) would have, I think, far more actual—if indirect—influence on Persian affairs than “ inspecting ” 3 or 4 officers, each with separate districts, the most senior of whom—the Consul-General at Ahwaz {vide Minister’s scheme) would belong to a different service. 7. Due access of the Political Resident to all Persian ports, as under the Inspecting Consul- Generalship scheme, would of course still be a necessary corollary to my proposal. 8. It would be preferable, 'but not absolutely essential, that the Consular officers under the Consul-General should belong to the Indian Poli tical Department. 9. There is of course no immediate hurry. It will be some years before the Bahrain Residency can materalise, but if my proposal^, with whatever modifications are considered neceasary, is approved of then now would appear to be the time to put it forward. 10. If it is put forward it seems to me the Government of India would be on very firm ground. The Persians could not object to our continuing to have a Consul-General here as in the past, and the extent of his exequatur would be a matter for H. M. G. to decide. 11. Vis- a-vis the Foreign Office too, from whom objection might be expected on the grounds of the extent of the Consul-General’s exequatur, tho position would be strong. It is common ground that the Government cf India have paramount interests in South Persia, and prima facie there would be nothing unreasonable in the demand that the consular control over the whole of this area, subject as now to the Minister, Tehran, should be in the hands of an officer of the Indian Political Department. 12. From the important view of finance too the suggestion is certainly not more costly than that proposed by the Minister. The A. P. O. C. have lately decreased their activities at Ahwaz, in the fields and at Abadan. In the latter place they have dismissed many of their European employees, and of their workmen—Indians and Persians, the idea being—I was informed by a senior A. P. 0.

Demi-official letter from Major T. C. W. Fowle, to Lieut.-Col. H. V. Biscoe, (on leave), No. 501-8. of 1931, dated the 18th August 1931. I enclose herewith a copy of a demi-official letter No. F.-369—M./30, dated the 10th August from Mr. Howell which explains itself. You will doubtless like to reply direct to Mr, Howell, to whom I am sending a copy of this letter. Demi-official letter from Lieut.-Col. H. V. Biscoi, (on leave) dated the 31st August 1931. Will you please refer to your demi-official letter No. F.-369-N./30, dated the 10th August 1931 to Fowle regarding consular establishments in Persia. I do not think there would be much object in deputing Barrett to visit consular posts in the Gulf. There are only two such posts : Moham- merah and Bunder Abbas. I have sent Fowle my general observations on the Minister’s des patch, by last air mail, and doubtless it will reach about the same time that this letter does.4 As regards Mohammerah, it is not necessary to add much to what I have said therein. I con sider it essentially a post that should be failed from India, and it is a post in which no change of status is possible or suggested. It is only a Vice-Consulate, and it is held by an Assistant Surgeon of the Indian Medical Department certainly the most economical arrangement pos sible. Speaking from memory, the clerical estab lishment consists of one English clerk, one Vernacular clerk, and a passport clerk who is paid from passport fees and is so to speak, self- supporting. This is clearly an aboslutely mini mum establishment. I will examine the Mohammerah budget on my return, but it is clear I think from the above that any economies that may be possible will be of a very petty and insignificant nature. As I have said in my previous letter however I see no necessity for the retention of the post S of Vice-Consul at Ahwaz, at any rate from the ' Indian point of view and I would recommend that it should be abolished. This would effect a material economy. As regards Bunder Abbas, Minister has suggest ed that it should be reduced to a Consular Agency or alternatively be held by an Honorary Consul. This post, like Mohammerah, has also been held by an Assistant Surgeon for many years past, and Minister does not specify exactly what he means by the suggestion to reduce its status to a Consular Agency. Is it proposed that the Consular Agent should be an Indian, or a Euro pean ? In the latter event there would be no saving, and even in the former the saving would be slight. The alternative proposal to appoint an Honorary Consul is I think financially pre ferable, but as I stated in my previous letter, the only possible individual who could be appoint ed is the Manager of the local branch of the Imperial Bank of Persia. I doubt the Bank agree ing, but I will sound the General Manager before I come out, and if he agrees, the question might be considered. As regards the establishment, I cannot remem ber exactly what the Bunder Abbas office consists of, but at most it is two clerks in the English office, and one in the vernacular. I will however look into the budget on my return, and see if any economies are possible. I do not think it would be possible to abolish the post. We must have gome one there to visa passports of persons going to India; to assist the considerable local Hindu Communitv and to take up with the local Governor minor difficulties encountered by the telegraph staffs at Jask, Charbar, Hen jam, etc. To sum up. * (i) 0 f the consular posts in the Persian Gulf, only one, that of Vice-Consul, Ahwaz is held by an officer of the Poltical Department. The other two, Moham merah and Bunder Abbas are both held by Assistant Surgeons, with minimum clerical establishments. A very economical arrangement. (ii) I think that the post of Vice-Consul, Ahwaz might be abolished with no detriment to Indian interests. (iii) There is no proposal to reduce the status of Mohammerah, and it is difficult to conceive any more economical arrange ment for filling it than the existing one. (iv) If Bunder Abbas were reduced to a Con- sular Agency, presumably the incum bent would be some one of more or less the same type as the present incumbent and there would be noy^v appreciable saving in cost. The pro^ posal to appoint an Honorary Consul has more to commend it, but the only possible nominee is the Manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia, and the Bank usually decline to allow their officials to take up consular work, but I will ascertain from the General Manager whether he would make an exception in the present case, and if so what allowances t would h »ve to be given etc., I will also review the establishment budget. p g' Could a copy of this letter he made in your office, and sent to Budiire for record, as I have no facilities for typing here.

With reference to this office endorsement No. 518-S. of 21st August 1931. I enclose here with a copy of my demi-official letter No. 587-S. of today’s date to Colonel Biscoe, together with a copy of paragraph 8 of his letter of 21st August referred to. Demi-official letter from Major T. C. W. Fowle, to Lieut.-Col. H. V. Biscoe, No. 587- S., OF 1931, DATED THE 8TH SEPTEMBER 1931. Please refer to the concluding sentence of paragraph 8 of your letter of 21st August, on consular districts in Persia, (a copy of which I enclose). 2. It is not clear whether you refer to the Consul-General’s district subsequent to the transfer of the Residency—if it ever takes place—or to his present district, the limits of which are under consideration. If the latter, then I think you would like to know that on the strength of the statement in paragraph 2 of your despatch No. 44-S., dated the 1st February 1931, to the Government of India, (copy to Secretary of State for India) to the effect that, on certain conditions, you had no objection to the exclusion of Fars from your district, I informed H. M. s Charge d’Affaires, Tehran (copy to Secretary of State for India), in paragraph 6 of my despatch No. 126/ 517-S., dated the 21st August 1931, that as Bushire would now be independent of the Governor-General of Fars, the latter province could presumably bs excluded from your exequatur. 3. In his despatch No. 440, dated the 18th August 1931 to the Foreign Office, Charge d’Affaires, Tehran, mentioned that he was only awaiting this expression of my views before furnishing his own on this last remaining diffi culty. If, therefore, you now wish Fars to be retained in your district you might like to write to the India Office so as to let them know before the Foreign Office reach a final decision. p. —x a m sending a copy of this to Wylie.5 Demi-official letter from Major T. C. W. fcowLE, C.B.E., Pol. Resident in the Per sian Gulf, No. 595-S. of 1931, dated the 10th September 1931. C With reference to your letter No. F. 369-N/30 of 28th July 1931 paragraph 3, I wrot^ to Colonel Biscoe demi-officially, a copy of my letter being forwarded to Mr. Howell under my demi-official letuer No. 492 of 3rd August and enclose a copy of his reply which is also in demi-official form. I This being so it may be more convenient to reply to your letter in the same manner ? My vi o ws— for what they are worth—can be taken as official. 2. Before going into details Colonel Biscoe makes some general observations (paragraphs 2 and 3). You will see that he entirely agrees with me in the views expressed as to the imperman- nence of the present state of law and order in this country. He further joins issue with Sir Robert Clive in the latter’s estimate of the comparative rates of pay drawn by officers of the Consular service and those of th. Indian Political Department. 3. To come down to details. The question of consular representation can be considered under two aspects : (a) when, and if, the Residency is moved to Bahrain; (b) under present conditions. With regard to (a). As Colonel Biscoe (paragraph 8 of his letter) points out the transfer of the Residency cannot take place in the near future, and there would therefore seem to bo no necessity to link any proposals for Bushire with proposals for changes elsewhere. I quite agree and merely made my suggestion as to what consular representation should be in South Persia if tae Residency were removed, as it seemed a con venient opportunity for doing so. The suggestion can be put aside for the present, and considered on its merits should the occasion for it arise. 4. With regard to (6), v.-e., consular representa tion under present conditions. On the subject of Meshed and Seistan, which 1 have some experience of having officiated at both places, I agree with Colonel Biscoe’s views—as given in his paragraph 4. 5. As regards Kerman —where I have also officiated—personally 1 think that, (specially in view of the considerations mentioned in para graph 2 above as to the impermanence of the present state of law and order in the country, Khuzistan is more important to the Government of India, and more in the Gulf area, than Kerman, and what I would suggest is that Kerman be given over to the Foreign Office in exchange for Ahwaz (see paragraph 8 below). 6. For Ahwaz there is—in my opinion—no need for a Consul-General as suggested by Sir Robert Clive. Our outstanding interest there is the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, but they -as I point ed out in my letter tc Colonel Biscoe paragraph 12—have greatly decreased their activities, and I have just heard that the Imperial Bank of Persia have closed their branch at Maidan-i-Naphtun (Oilfields) which existed merely for the Anglo- Persian Oil Company works. There is in my opinion—only room for one Consul-General in South Persia, and he should be at Bushire. 7. Mohammerah .—1 agree with Colonel Biscoe. 8. Bushire.—My view is that representation should continue as at present, but that the Resident in his capacity of Consul-General should have consular control over Khuzistan, (Ahwaz and Mohammerah—^see paragraph 5 above), and over Shiraz (see paragraph 9 below). 9. Shiraz .—Personally I think that a Consular Agent might be sufficient for this post, where there is little work now-a-days ; Mr. Chick, who was Consul there from 1921 to 1930, made the same recommendation before leaving the post. If a Consular Agent is finally appointed there it would seem necessary for Shiraz to be under the control of the Consul-General, Bushire (see paragraph 8 above). 10. Bandar Abbas .—I agree with Colonel Biscoe. 11. There are three schemes for consular re presentation in Persia now in the field : Sir Robert Clive’s, Colonel Biscoe’s and mine, and 1 have shown how these compare with present conditions on the attached tabular form. I have not includ ed Meshed and Seistan in the form which I have confined to the Gulf area only. I am sending a copy of this letter to Colonel Biscoe. I Demi-official letter from Lieutenant-Colo nel H. V. Biscoe, to Major T. C. W. Fowle, C.B.E., dated the 3ist August 1931. Please refer to your D. 0. No. 491-S., dated 3rd August 1931, forwarding for my vi&gt;ws a copy of letter F.-S69-N./30, dated 28th July 1931, from the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department regard ng consular districts in Persia. 2. I would like to premise my detailed obser vations with one or two general remarks. Firstly I entirely agree with the view express ed in paragraph 3 of your letter that the present state of law and order and strong centralised administration is by no means nece.-sarilv per manent. It depends, as you say, on the life of one man, and I personally have never met any one in Persia who anticipated anything except an entire bre\ lown of the present regime sooner or later. It is\ viuusly difficult for persons who have never seeK Persia except under present conditions to realisb what it w.;s like formerly, and how easily it may revert to its former con dition. I think tl erefore that we should be cautious in introducing sweeping changes or modifications in our consular establishments, which were built up gradually as the outcome of practical necessity, and may prove necessary again. Once a post has been abolished or given \up it will be difficult to re-establish it, and the /policy therefore that I would advocate would be / to keep existing posty alive, but at a minimum / cost, by appointing less highly-paid officers, and / scrutinising in some cases allowances, etc. 3. There is one matter to which Sir Robert Clive has referred and on which I should like to join issue with him, and that is his reference to the comparative rates of pay drawn by officers of the Consular Service and of the Indian Gov ernments nior officers of the Political Depart ment certainly draw higher pav (though not double) than officers of the Consular Service, but in the junior ranks, when cost of living ( bonus, and frais de representation, and the much CC4 enclosure in f FOREIGN SECRETARY’S ffi’’ 1 !? ’93? ^ i.iAR. ffifurmore liberal passage allowances granted to officers of the Consular Service are taken into considertition, there is actually \ery little differ ence in the rates of pay, and to talk of Indian officers drawing double the pay of their consular confreres is entirely inaccurate. 4. Now I consider that India has very real and definite interests in Southern and Eastern Persia: these interests are strategic, political, and commercial. North-eastern Persia, includ ing Meshed, and not merely S istan is of strate gic and political importance to India, and the whole of British trade in that part of the world is in the hands of Indian traders, of whom there are con iderable numbers in Meshed: and in addition it is of course an important place of pilgrimage for certain sections of the Indian Mohammedan population. All trade in Persia is of course more or less stagnant at present, owing to the restrictions recently introduced, but modifications will have to bo made, and we may certainly expect to s°e a trade revival in due coarse, and then Indian traders will doubt less resume their normal activities. With In dians, an Indian officer is certainly more com petent to deal than an officer of the Levant Ser vice, and they naturally prefer dealing with some one who speaks their language and knows their customs, etc. For the above reasons I would deprecate replacing the Indian officer at Meshed by an officer of the Levant Service. On the other hand I understand that some reduction has already been effected in the cost of the post and I think it might be possible, in view of the urgent need for economy, to review some of the allowances granted to the incumbent. They were fix^d when there was a large number of Russians to entertain there, and when transport rates were much higher, and at that time Meshed was undoubtedly a most expensive post: but conditions have now chlnged. 5. As regards Kerman, I have already express ed* the opinion that the post might suitably be held by a more junior officer than in the past, or even by an Assistant Surgeon like Richardson, provided some care was taken in his selec tion. There is not the same objection to hand ing over this post to the Levant Consular ser vice -feSi- there is in the case of Meshed, but as I have shown above, if a comparatively junior Indian officer was appointed his pay would not be appreciably greater than that of a Levant officer. The post, even if there is not much work to do there now, should certainly be kept ‘ alive ’, so to speak, as it embraces practically the whole of south-eastern Persia, an area with which we should not lose touch, and which in changed circumstances may be of considerable importance. A 6. In paragraph 5 of his despatch Sir R. Clive states that there are a large number of Indians employed by the A. P. O. C. in Khuzistan. This is no longer the case. As you point out the A. P. 0. C. have virtually closed down Ahwaz and the number of Indians at Mohammerah and Abadan is very much greater than at Ahwaz. I am therefore strongly of opinion that Mo hammerah should be retained by an Indian officer Further the consular officer at Moham merah has many dealings with the passport and emigration authorities at Bombay, and with officers on the Arab littoral. I have visited Mohammerah constantly since I have been at Bushire, and speak with personal knowledge of the work th re, and it is essentially a pest that should be held by an officer of the Indian Ser vice : the work consists very largely of assisting and advising Indians, and dealing with authori ties in India and this an officer of the Indian service is more competent to do than an officer of the Levant S ervice. 7. On the other hand I see no necessity for the retention of the post of Vice-Consul at Ahwaz, at any rate as far as Indian interests are concerned. There are now few Indians there, and I should have thought that one officer could have perfermed the duties of the post. If however it is considered desirable that the prospective Consul-General there should have an assistant, this might be found by his own service. This is on the assumption of course that Mohammerah is held by an Indian officer. 8. As regards Bushire, circumstances have now changed somewhat since Sir R, Clive left, and the Governorship of the Gulf Ports has once again been made independent of Fars, and this can certainly be regarded as the normal arrange ment. I know that Sardar-i-Intisar who tempo rarily held both appointments felt that there were great difficulties in combining the two posts, and I doubt if the experiment will be repeated. In his despatch Sir R. Clive has suggested that when the Re-idency is transferred there should be a senior Consul at Bushire with a Vice-Consul at Bushire and another at Shiraz, while in the accompanying memorandum he has suggested that the consular officer at Bushire might be a Consul-General, and you have sup ported the latter proposal. I think there is a good deal to be said for the proposal, but it really seems rather unnecessary to consider the matter at present. The transfer of the Residency cannot take place in the very near future : the proposals involve no changes in the existing consular arrangements, and it will be time enough to consider the matter when the transfer has assumed a more definite form. No changes are contemplated until the transfer takes place, and it is always unwise to try and look too far ahead in a country like Persia, and there would therefore seem to be no necessity to link any proposals for Bushire with proposals for changes elsewhere. As Sir R. Cl've points out however Bushire and Shiraz have many points of contact and common interests and I would therefore take this opportunity of mentioning that while I think Khuzistan might be excluded from the exequatur of the Consul-General at Bushire, Fars should continue to be included, in addition of course to the Persian littoral. 9. There only remains the question of Bandar Abbas. The Minister suggests that it might be reduced to a Consular Agency, in normal times however there is a large Indian colony at Bandar Abbas, and a considerable volume of trade with the interior. The post has for many years past been held by an Assistant Surgeon, a satis factory and economical arrangement and I would deprecate any change. The reduction of the post to a Consular Agency would not affect any very mateiial economy. A further suggestion has been made to appoint a* local Englishman as Honorary Consul: the only possible nominee however would be the local Manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia. I have always understood however that the Bank did not like their employes performing consular functions, and i think it would be difficult for the Manager to combine the two posts.8 Sumrudry. — Present strength.

Please refer to your telegram dated the 29th of November, No. 158. You are of course the best judge whether it is necessary for you to refer to the Foreign Office, but it had not been anticipated here that any such re r erence would be necessary, unless the officer appointed to do the examination at Meshed, Sistan and Kerman was likely to be away long enough to compel his being placed on special duty. Sistan and Kerman being, as I understand, accessible by car from Meshed, it was thought here that a fort night’s absence from headquarters or so on the part of Barrett, which would cost next to nothing, would suffice to put the business through. He has of course provision in his budget for touring charges and these, like other diplomatic and consular expenditure in Persia, are shared with the F. 0. So if you think reference necessary, we have no objection. A letter has been sent to Barrett asking how long he thinks the duty would take, and I will in due course let you know what he says.

C. J. Barrett, Consul General, Meshed, No. 1387/279/34, dated the 12th December 1931. Ido not think it. would be necessary to put me on special duty to enable me to carry out the enquiry to which you refer in your demi- official F.-369-N./30 of 30th November. It should not involve an absence from Meshed of more than three weeks and Hamber could easily carry on during that period especially if it is in winter or early spring when work is at its lightest. In this connection please sse my No. 1351/279/ 33 of 2nd December (Serial No. 55). Demi-official letter from Major C. K. Daly, Consul for Sistan and Kain, No. 511/ 20/1, dated the 22nd December 1931. I have not been asked to comment on the correspondence forwarded me under No. F.- 369-N./30 of 30th November, presumably because the matter, as far as it affects Sistan, is shelved pending a decision as regards the railway. I note however, that the Government of India quote as a basis for their decision, my predeces sor’s letter No. 2-D. of 26th February 1928, written after his experience of this Consulate extending over 10 months. I discussed this letter with you when I was in Delhi last Xmas, after I had been here for two years. Skrine’s proposals, were based primarily on political grounds, whereas the present financial crisis has now brought the matter up for fur ther consideration. My predecessor in para. II of his letter 2-D. did not contemplate the total closure of Sistan, but that an Indian Vice-Consul should be placed there and that the existing Dakchis and Levies (the latter no longer exist) should be retained. Moreover he did not contemplate the aboli tion of the post of Vice-Consul at Zahidan, but was of the opinion that the Vice-Consul would deal with the routine work leaving the Consul more free to keep in touch with Birjand, Sistan and the Sarhad. He advocates the Consul visiting Sistan for two months or so each cold weather. Skrine’s letter was written while on tour, and it is significant that in paragraph 12 he men tioned that he could not commit himself to framing financial details. I have devote:! a great f deal of thought to this matter during the three years I have been here. There are undoubtedly some cogent reasons in favour of transfer of the Consulate Headquarters to Zahidan, but of one fact I am quite convinced and that is, that economy would not result. There is no accommodation at Zahidan, the Vice-Consulate consists of a ‘ Kacha ’ building of three rooms. The offices arc scattered over a considerable area, some hundreds of yards from the Vice- Consulate and from each other, and are in ‘ War ’ huts, the former Base Hospital of the East Persia Cordon. Even so, tho upkeep 9 of these buildings costs more than those of the whole of the Sistan Consulate, materials and labour being so expensive at Zahidan. The remark in para. II of letter 2-D. “ A new Consulate would have to be built ” is by no means unimportant. The capital expenditure would be extremely high—building at Zahidan is excessively expensive—the annual upkeep would be a huge figure compared with what is now spent both at Sistan and Zahidan. The cost of everything at Zahidan is now roughly 8 times higher than at Sistan and tho optimistic forecast that office allowance and other expenditure could be reduced is, I am convinced, quite erroneous. Another point missed, is that there is no water-supply at Zahidan. The cost of the present supply, to the small Vice-Consulate, is considerable, and is already causing concern to the Government of India. Should the Con sulate move there, the cost of this alone would be very great. What can be done, and has now been re cently effected, is a very great reduction in expenditure in several directions, and the total cost of the Sistan Consulate has now been re duced to the utmost extent possible while the fabric of the Consulate arrangements has not been greatly rent. To my mind it is inconceivable that further economy can be attained by— 1. Building a Consulate and many subsidiary buildings which would be necessary at Zahidan at a capital cost which will swallow any savings (in themselves mythical) for many years. 2. Retaining an Indian Vice-Consul and small staff at Sistan, which entails upkeep of the buildings there, as at present. 3. Running a Consulate at Zahidan where every item of expenditure will be higher than at Sistan. Assuming that it would be bad policy to entirely scrap all the buildings at Sistan, these would have to be maintained. The cost would be no less than when occupied, probably rather higher. Neglect of upkeep for even one year entails heavy expenditure later, as the buildings are of a style which suffers annual damage from rains, and rapidly deteriorate if neglected, and there would also be a good deal of incidental expenditure in other directions. In some respects, particularly if the railway re-opens Duzdap is undoubtedly a more pleasant place to live in—a fact which I cannot help think ing has to some extent influenced individual opinions—but the cost to government of the im provement of amenities for the Consul, will certainly not be negligible, if any such scheme be proceeded with. When the time comes, and if it be required, I can prepare a detailed scheme, but I cannot hold out any likelihood of its being an economical one. I believe we have recently effected greater savings than even Skrine imagined possible when he made his optimistic forecast to support his proposals for transfer of the Consulate, and we have achieved this without disturbing essential arrangements. Inasmuch as such a transfer will undoubtedly increase, not further decrease, ex penditure, I consider that the disadvantages con siderably outweigh the advantages.Telegram R., to Minister, Tehran, No. 2-T., DATED THE 16TH JANUARY 1932. (Repeated Consul-General, Meshed.) Demi-official. Please refer to Barrett’s de spatch No. 1351/279/33, dated 2nd December. In view of special nature of duties for perform ance of which Secretary to Consul General, Meshed, is appointed, it seems very undesir able that he should be invested with status of Vice-Consul. We are however very anxious to bring post of Vice-Consul under reduction for financial reasons and trust that lack of Vice- Consul need not prevent Barrett from visiting Sistan and Kerman to advise about reductions there as proposed in correspondence ending with my demi-official dated 6th December, No. 369- N./30. He is confident that this would not entail absence from Meshed for more than three weeks and says that winter or early spring is season when this absence would be least inconvenient. It would be unnecessary to place him on special duty. Government of India would be glad to know whether any alternative arrangement for dis charge of current routine duties at Meshed can be suggested and if not whether you think this period of absence is so long as to make it impos sible for him to undertake proposed duty, assum ing that you are otherwise no longer opposed to this.

Dear 23r. Howell, I have not been asked to comment on the correspondence forwarded me under Ho, ]?.359-11/30 of 30th Hovember presumably because the matter, as far as it affects Sistan, is shelved pending a decision as regards the railway. I note however that the Government of India quote as a basis for their decision, my predecessors letter Ho. 2-D of 26th February 1923, written after his experience of this Consulate extending over 10 months. I discussed this letter with you when I was in Delhi last Xmas, after I had been here for two years. Skrine , s proposals, were based primarily on political grounds, whereas the present financial crisis has now brought the matter up for further consideration. predecessor in para II of his letter 2-D did not contemplate the total closure of Sistan, but that an Indian Vice Consul should be placed there and that the existing Dakchis and Levies (the latter no longer exist) should be retained. Moreover he did not contemplate the abolition of the post of Vice Consul at Zahidan, but was of the opinion that the Vice Consul would deal with the routine work leaving the Consul more free to keep in touch with Birjand, Sistan and the Sarhad. HeHe advocates the Consul visiting Sistan for two months or so each cold weather. Shrine*s letter was written while on tour, and it is significant that in para 12 he mentioned that he could not commit himself to framing financial details. I have devoted a great deal of thought to this matter during the three years I have been here. There are undoubtedly some cogent reasons in favour of transfer of the Consulate Headquarters to Zahidan, but of one fact I am quite convinced, and that is, that economy would not result. There is no accommodation at Zahidan, the Vice Consulate consists of a ‘Kacha ’ building of three rooms. The offices are scattered over a considerable area, some hundreds of ysrds from the Vice Consulate and from each other, and are in “War** huts, the former Bs se Hospital of the E&amp;st-Persia Cordon. Even so, the upkeep of these buildings costs more than those of the whole of the Sistan Consulate, materials and labour being so expensive at Zahidan. The remark in Para II of letter 2-D V new Consulate would have to be biiilt” is by no means unimportant. The capital expenditure would be extremely high - building at Zsnidan is excessively expensive - the annual upkeep would be a, huge figure compared with what is now spent both at Sistan and Zahidan. The cost of everything at Zahidan is now roughly 3 times higher than at Sistan and the optimistic forecast that office allowance and other expenditure could be reduced is, I am convinced, quite erroneous. Znotheranother point missed, is that there is no water-supply at Z&amp;hidan. The cost of the present supply, to the small Vice Consulate, is considers.hie, and is already causing concern to the Government of India. Should the Consulate move there, the cost of this alone would he very great. What can he done, and has now been recently effected, is a very great reduction in expenditure in several directions, and the total cost of the Sistan Consulate has now been reduced to the utmost extent possible while the fabric of the Consulate arrangements has not been greatly rent. To ray mind it is inconcievable that further economy can be attained by. 1. Building a Consulate and many subsidiary buildings which would be necessary at Zahidan at a capital cost which will swallow any savings (in themselves zqythical) for many y ear s • 2. Retaining an Indian Vice Consul and small staff at Sist^n, v/hich entails upkeep of the buildings there, as at present. 3. Running a Consulate at Zahidan where every item of expenditure will be higher than at Si stan* Assuming that it would be bad policy to entirely scrap all the buildings at Sistan, these would h&amp;ve to be maintained. The cost would be no less than when occupied, probably rather higher. lleglect of upkeep for even one year entails heavy expenditure later, as the buildings are of a style which suffers annual damage from rains, and rapidly deteriorate if neglected, andand tliere would also 'be a good deal of incidental expenditure in other directions. In same respects, particularly if the railway re-opens Duj^dap is undoubtedly a more pleasant place to live in - a fact which I cannot help thinking has to some extent influenced individual opinions - but the cost to government of the improvement of amenities for the Consul, will certainly not be negligible, if any such scheme be proceeded with. When the time comes, and if it be required, I can prepare a detailed scheme, but I cannot hold out any liklihood of its being an economical one. I believe we have recently effected greater savings than even Skrine imagined possible when he made his optimistic forecast to support his proposals for transfer of the Consulate, and we have achieved this without disturbing essential arrangements. Inasmuch as such a transfer will undoubtedly increase, not further decrease, expenditure, I consider that the disadvunta ges considerably outweigh the advantages. Yours sincerely, (Sd. ) C. K.

'2 Sir Robert Clive, in a despatch of 13th June (Flag A) submitted a scheme for the reorganisation of the consulates in Persia, and the Government of India, having obtained the views of Colonel Barrett(Flag B), Colonel Biscoe (Flag C), Major Fowle (Flag D) and Major Daly (Flag F) on this scheme, have now submitted their own conclusions and suggestions. With regard to Kermanshah , Tabriz,Tehran, iIspahan, Resht and Hamadan they have no comments to offer on Sir R.Clive T s scheme. The remaining posts are considered under two heads (a) East Persia and (b) South Persia and the Gulf. With regard to (a) the Government of India are unable to agree with the suggestion that the Consul General,Me shed should be a Levant Service Officer. They have definitely that the H.Q,. !of the Sistan Consulate should be moved to Duzdap and the post of Vice Consul there abolished,but propose to wait till the future of the Duzdap railway is clearer than at present before tailing action. Bir jand is not mentioned either in the Minister 1 s despatch or in the Government of India’s letter, but from P*Z.6887/31_ submitted below it will be seen that the Government of India propose to abolish the Vice Consulate there. With regard to (b) the Minister proposed that the Consulate at Ahwaz be raised to the status of Consulate-General for Khtfzistan and Luristan with subordinate Vice Consulates at Ahwaz and Mohammerah. The Government of India consider that a Consul at Ahwaz is sufficient and that the post of Vice Consul there,should be abolished. They have no objection to_ as' .a 1 to the Consul 'being designated Consul for KhUzistan and Luristan and to the designation of the Consul General, Bushire ; being altered accordingly so long as the Consul General is allowed to visit Mohammerah for discussion with the Vice Consul, who should be an officer with Indian experience, preferably an Assistant Surgeon of the Indian Service. The Government of India consider that with regard to Bushire the question of the removal of the Residency, postulated in the Minister's scheme, may be disregarded for the present. They propose that in future the Consul General's district be described as ’'The Coasts and Islands of the Persian.Gulf being within the dominions 2) i rf' of Persia inducing Lingah. :T (See also P.Z.7641/31, r\ vryiT»,r-iaq_. Tehran Despatch Ho.496 on attached file). On the separation of the Province of Pars from the district of the Consul General the latter would still be allowed to visit Shiraz for discussion. The Consulate there should be reduced to a Vice-Consulate for Jars and Laristan. The Government of India thinh that the /ice Consul at Bandar Abbas should continue to hold joint charge of the Consulate at Kerman until the post becomes vacant, when a Consular Agent might be appointed to Bandar Abbas and a Vice Consul to Kerman —KcH^tan- as the L-inisuer has proposed. The Government of India would prefer that Kerman should be under the charge of an Indian officer, but the objections to an officer from a service unconnected with India are not so sLrong as at Meshed or Mohammerah.

November 1951. Reorganisation of Consular posts and establishments in Persia. I am directed to refer to Mr.Walton f s letter No.P.2. &gt; 6122/31, dated the 22nd October 1931, and to submit the conclusions and suggestions of the Government of India with reference to the proposed reorganisation of Consular posts in Persia* /v* 2. It seems necessary at the outset to indicate briefly the main consid.erations that have influenced the Government of India in dealing with this problem which, as the correspondence reveals, is one of no little importance and complexity. In the first place the Government of India observe that general agreement exists among the local authorities concerned that a prima facie case is made out for a reduction of the present scale of Consular expenditure in Persia ft $'■ consequent upon the abolition of the capitulatory regime anc the establishment in Tehran of a strongly centralised form of / j* administration. r ilie financial situation in India requires at the same time that every form of economy consistent with the maintenance of Indians essential interests in Persia sh«,ll oe introduced and that at the earliest date possible. It would however in the opinion of the Government of India be unwise to ignore the fact that the prospects of permanence for the existing regime in Persia are still very doubtful and should the country(£52) « the country for any reason revert to anarchy British Consular officers in Persia might once more find themselves called upon to assume a role not very different from that which they sustained in the past* While therefore the Government of India are satisfied that economies can and should he introduced they would deprecate changes likely to impair the essential fabric of British Consular representation in Persia. The detailed proposals which have now to be made have been evolved with reference to these considerations* 5* The proposals recommended by His Majesty* s Minister at Tehran are contained in Sir Robert Clive* s despatch Bo*3ll* dated the 13th June 1931. ‘J3ae Government of India have no comments to offer regarding the revised arrangements suggested for; Kerman shah Tabriz Tehran Ispahan Resht Ramadan. The remaining posts may for convenience be considered under two headsi- (a) East Persia, and V (b) South Persia and the Gulf. East Persia for present purposes may be regarded as comprising only the Meshed Consulate-General and the Sis tan and Kain Consulate* Kerman will be dealt with under South Persia. Eor Meshed His Majesty*8 Minister suggests a Consul General only (to be of the Levant Service) assisted by the “Secretary to the Cdnsul-General”. The Government of India are in the first place in some doubt whether the special duties required from the latter officer make it desirable that he should perform consular functions in addition. The point is however perhaps of no great importance for, as will be observed from his letter Ho*880/333/2, datedf '253/ dated the 10th August 1931, it appears probable that the Consul General Meshed will be able to carry on the existing duties of the post single-handed* In these circumstances the Government of India agree that the post of Vice-Consul, Meshedf may be abolished. ]?or the reasons indicated in letter from His Majesty’s Consul-General, Meshed, Ho*880/333/2, dated the 10th August 1931, the Government of India are however unable to agree to the additional proposal that this post be filled in future from the Levant Service. 4* His Majesty’s Minister proposes to abolish a Consular post at Sistan or 2ahidan. ihe Government of India have given this proposal much careful consideration and for the reasons (among others) stated in letter from His Majesty’s Consul, r Sistan and Kain Ho.2-D, dated the 26th February 1928 (copy attached) have now definitely reached the conclusion that at any rate as a temporary measure the headquarters of this Consulate should be moved to Zahidan and the post of Vice- Consul there abolished. Before however any definite action in this direction is taken the Government of India propose to await developments in connection with the re-opening of the Zahidan railway. As soon therefore as it is possible to forecast with some precision what the future of this sector of railway is to be a further communication will be addressed to you on the subject of Consular representation in Sistan and Kain. Advantage will be taken of the period which must intervene before a definite decision is arrived at to consider in - detail what arrangements should be introduced on the abolition of the existing Consulate in Sistan^^^ 1 ^ 5. In South Persia His Majesty’s Minister recommends that the status of the existing Consulate at Ahwaz be raised to that of a Consul-General for the Province of Khuzistan and Luristan with subordinate Vice-Consulates at Ahwaz and Mohammerah. 'ihe Government of India are not aware of the reasons for this and are■ 2s4 are not satisfied as to its necessity, ffrom such information as is available to them the ^Anglo Persian Oil Company appear to be curtailing their activities in this region, and in any case, as His Majesty^ Minister himself points out, the Anglo Persian Oil Company require little consular assistance under present conditions and tend increasingly to have recourse to His Majesty’s Legation at Tehran for such assistance as they require. The number of Indians employed by the Company is also being rapidly reduced and Indian interests nowadays would appear, if anything, to require protection at Mohammerah and Abadan rather than at Ahwaz* In all the circumstances therefore the Government of India consider that the retention of a Consul at Ahwaz will be sufficient to meet the requirements of this post and that the post of Vice-Consul at Ahwaa should be abolished. As regards Mohammerah, as the work at this post consists largely in assisting and advising Indians and in dealing with authorities in India, the Government of India are of opinion that the present arrange ment by which the post is held by an Assistant Surgeon of the Indian Service should continue. Although the Government of India had agreed in their telegram U0.1133-S, dated the 25th June 1926 to the appointment of an officer of the Levant Service to this Vice-Consulate^ they are now on reconsideration satisfied that the nature of the duties required from the Vice Consul at Mohammerah is such that they can only be satisfactorily dis charged by an officer with Indian experience. As stated in their letter No.P.369-H/SO, dated the 23rd March 1931, the Government of India see no objection to His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz being described in future *s his Majesty’s Consul for Khuzistan and Luristan and to the designation of His Majesty’s Consul General at Bushire being amended accordingly- subject however to the proviso that His Majesty’s Consul General at Bushire is ctllowed to visit Mohammerah for discussion of Indian and Gulf questions with the Vice^Consul^ when the necessity arises. 6 . As regards Shiraz, His Majesty’s Minister suggests that whenwhen the Residency is removed from the Persian side of the Gulf a Consul at Bushire with Vice-Consuls at Bush ire, Shiraz, and a Consular Agent at Bandar ABbas would be sufficient# The Government of India concur in this suggestion* As however recent developments suggest that the conclusion of a general treaty with Persia may possibly be delayed they consider that it is for the present only necessary to decide what economies can be effected in Consular representation in South Persia under actual present conditions# After careful consideration of the various possible alternatives the Government of India propose therefore that the District of His Majesty’s Consul- General, Bushire, be now limited to the jurisdiction of the Governor of the Gulf ports, end that in future his District be described in His Majesty’s Commission as ’’Die Coasts and Islands of the Persian Gulf being within the dominions of Persia including the District of Lingah**# The province of Laristan along with Pars would then form one Consular District with headquarters at Shiraz. The status of the latter post might, the Government of India consider, be reduced at once to that of Ak Vice-Consul. On separation of the Province of Pars from the District of His Majesty’s Consul-General at Bushire it would be understood that the latter w'ould be allowed to proceed to Shiraz on duty in summer when circumstances permitted of his proceeding on recess. As regards Bandar Abbas, although there is a considerable Indian Colony at this place and a certain volume of trade is carried on with the interior, the Government of India are prepared to agree that when the post next becomes vacant a Consular Agent might replace the present Vice-Consul. In the meantime they see no reason why the present Vice-Consul at Bandar Abbas should not continue to hold joint charge of the Consulate at Kerman. The fact that as Vice-Consul ^Bandar Abbas p the present incumbent is under the administrative control of His Majesty’s Consul General at Bushire while in his capacity as Consul, Kerman, he is directly subordinate8. (zsy t subordinate to His Majesty’s Minister appears in practice to lead to no inconvenience and the arrangement, which is an economical one, should therefore in the opinion of the Govern ment of India he allowed to continue at any rate for the ^ present. As the Consular District of Kerman includes practically the whole of South Eastern Persia the Government of India consider that it would he inadvisable to abolish Consular representation there entirely. They propose therefore that a Vice-Consulate he retained at Kerman which, if it should become | necessary to discontinue the present temporary arrangement, might he held either by a carefully selected Assistant Surgeon of the Indian Service or by a junior officer of the Political Department or the Levant Service. The Government of India would naturally prefer to retain the post as one to be filled by one of their own officers, but the objections, in present conditions, to the admission of an officer from a service unconnected with India are not so strong as at Meshed or Mohammerah. 7. When a definite decision has been arrived at regarding the status of these various posts, the Government of India propose to examine the subordinate establishments also, the intention being that only that establishment should be retained which is considered necessary under present conditions for the posts as reconstituted, 'ilie Political Resident in the Gulf is at present scrutinising the establishments maintained at Consulates and Vice Consulates in his area while for Meshed, Sistan and Kerman it is proposed to depute a senior officer to examine establishments as soon as the future status of these posts has been definitely decided. His Majesty’s Minister will no doubt consider the advisability of undertaking a similar enquiry regarding other Consular establishments in Persia when the future status of the latter has been determined.8 . A copy of this letter has been sent to Kis Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, and to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Foreign Secretary to the Government of India.

Proposal to move the headquarters of the Sistan Consulate from Sis tan to Duzdap and to reduce its establishment. Sir, have With reference to conversations I^Aiad with Mr.Ache son on the above subject during my present visit to Delhi, I have the honour to invite the attention of the Government of India to certain anomalies in the existing arrangements for Consular representation in East Persia, and to forward tentative proposals for their rectification. 2 . I regret that I have not got with me the papers connect ed with Mr.Gould’s recommendations, made, 1 thinTc, early in 1924, that the headquarters of the Sistan Consulate should be moved to Duzdap. Those recommendations were not followed, nor, so far as I know, was any action taken on the proposal contained in Colonel Haworth’s telegram Ho.lOl-C dated 3rd December 1924 to the effect that the status of the Sistan Consulate should be reduced and that it should be made subordinate to the Meshed Consulate General* 5. in deciding against the latter proposal the Government of India were possibly influenced by the arguments adduced by Mr.Gould and Major Fisher in their letters Dos.18 A dated 18th January and 125 dated 10th May 1925 respectively 0 It would take too long to examine these arguments in detail, and I will only say that, whatever aspect the problem may have assumed in 1924-5, now in 1928 the situation is changed, and thattnat the time has come to review the present Consular arrange ments in sis tan, the Kainat and the SarhajfcU and to ask our selves whether, in relation to the output of work and the importance of the district, they are not both expensive and inconvenient^ 4* I have now held the post of Consul, Sistan and Kain, for ten months and am in a position to compare it with the Kerman and Kashgar posts which I have held, and with Meshed which I visited last autumn as the guest of H.M’s Consul General, Col. j| Bis c°e. x n my opinion the siz.e of the Sistan Consular establish ment should be reduced and its headquarters moved to Duzdap in place of the existing Vice Consulate there, which may be East Persia, vide his telegrams and letters of 1923-4 passim , was not, as it turns out, justified. There were two factors which he did not, perhaps, take sufficiently into considerations Russian competition and Persian / greed. Already in 1924 Russia was fast regaining her lost position in the North Persian market; while by the imposition of greatly increased duties in the shape of the Road Tax on all commodities and the so-called Monopoly Taxes on our two chief exports to Persia, tea and sugar, the Persians have done their best to kill the golden-egg- laying goose of the Duzdap import trade. (2) At least 80 of what trade there is passes northwards to Khurassan and beyond. Col. Haworth in his telegram No.7 dated 21st Jan. 1926 put the percentage at 98, but I think this is an overstatement. At any rate, the sum total of the trade of Sis tan, the Sarhad and the Kainat hardly justifies a large Consular establishment in addition to that of Meshed. (3) The old Indo-Persian caravan route passed through Sistan, which in those days was an important auks entrepot. With the advent of the Nushki-Duzdap railway and of the motor-car, the stream of trade has been deflected from Sistan to the direct Duzdap-BirjandrMeshed route. Sistan is nowadays a backwater; the abolished. In support of these proposals I would invite consi deration of the following pointsi- (1) Mr.Gould* s optimistic view of Indian trade prospects in towntown, which Ulas nearer much more than a largish mud village, does not now contain more than 4000 or 5000 inhabitants* (4) Owing to its remoteness from the capital, Sis tan has little or no interest for the Persian Government, most of whom, I should think, would have to he shown where it is on the map. Mr. Gould and Major Pisher based much of their optimism on the visits of Major Hall and Dr.Loomis of the American Financial Mission and the schemes they evolved, in collaboration with the British Consulate, for the development and improvement of the Sis tan district. How the American Financial Advisers are no more, and all the available cash in the Persian till is hypothecated for the Muhaumarah-Bandar i Gaz Railway and other projects nearer Tehran. The prospects of a Duzdap-Sistan Light Rack Railway, a Kelraand barrage or a radical improvement in the Sis tan land-tenure system are all equally remote. Duzdap, in fact, is much more in the Persian limelight than Sistan. As an illustration of this I may mention that the Persian Government have allotted Ts.300 a month for the Duzdap school and Ts. 170 for sanitation, lighting etc.; Sistan receives Ts.7Q for its school and not much more for its 'municipality 11 . Even Khwash boasts a more expensive school than Sis tanJ 5. It may be urged that most of what importance Sistan enjoyed before the war was in connection with Russia, not with Persia. With the re-establishment of a Soviet Consulate in Sistan, it might at first sight seem as if the conditions which existed prior to the Anglo-Russian Convention of 190 7 were returning. My qualifications to express an opinion on so wide an issue xflc are limited, but my impression is that Soviet attempts to encroach upon our sphere of influence in South Persia need not be taken very seriously. In spite of the flourish of trumpets with which the Russian Consulate was reopened last October, and of its lavish expenditure on agents and the purchase of wool at exorbitant prices, no serious attempts have as yet been made to undermine our influence prestigef?G'\ prestige otherwise than by trade competition. Our position in south-east Persia rests upon far too solid foundations - the work of Webb-Ware, 0*Connor, Prideaux, Gould and other officers, the memory of the McMahon Mission, the occupation of East Persia during the war and the millions spent in the country in connection therewith, the action taken during the Sarhad disturbances of 1925 and 1926, and so on - to be affected seriously by the machinations, if any, of a couple of Russian consular officers (neither of whom speaks a word of Persian) without either nationals to look after or genuine trade interests to pursue. 6 . On the above considerations I base the following propo sitions (1) Neither from the commercial nor the political point of view is a large and expensive consular establishment required in the Sis tan-Kainat-Sarhad district; (2) Such establishment as is required should be based upon Duzdap rather than Sistan. 7. Taking the latter question first, the following advantages may be conceded to Sistan as the Consular headquarters* (a) Cheapness. The cost of living there is about half that at Sirjand or Duzdap. Sistan is therefore popular with the staff, who save most of their pay. As for the Consul, besides cheapness he gets allowanced amounting to Rs.500/~ a month, on which it is possible for him to live without touching his pay. (b) There is a large and roomy Consulate with a good garden and plenty of accommodation in the compound for clerks etc. (c) The Soviet Consulate can be watched from close quarters* • Against the above it may be urged* (a) Life at Sistan may be cheap, but it is also nasty. The climate is trying; the abundance of fleas and other insect life has to be seen (and felt) to be believed; amenities and amusements are few and far between. Moreover, the isolation of Si s tanSis tan amid its network of unbridled canals and branches of the Helmand, which causes the cheapness of its foodstuffs, is itself a great disadvantage from the administrative point of view* (b) To go on spending large sums of money on Sis tan because large sums have been spent on it in the past is “throwing * good money after bad 14 * (c) If we leave Sistan, the Russians will probably leave it too. In any case, the machinations of the Soviet Oonsul, if any, can be watched and counteracted as well, or better,from Duzdap as from Sistan. Moreover, I do not suggest that Sistan should be evacuated altogether. A well-paid Indian Vice /Consul should be retained there, together with the hospital. The Consul from Duzdap should also spend a month or two there in the cold weather, and visit it occasionally at other times in the year. 8 . Duzdap on the other hand has several points in its favour. (1) It is on the Indian railway system, and is also, unlike Sistan, connected with Birjand and Meshed by an unmetalled road which, though very rough according to our ideas, is at any rate passable by motors at all seasons v/itnout fear of obstruction by floods, heavy sand or mud. (2) The climate is dry and bracing and the surroundings clean and open; the insect nuisance is little worse than at Quetta. (3) The Sarhad and Persian Baluchistan can be more effectively watched from Duzdap than from Sistan, and better touch maintained with Baluchistan* 9. Another point to which I attach importance is that the Duzdap post is a distinctly difficult one, and the i/ork is exceptionally varied and complex. All sorts of knotty inter national questions concerning the customs, the railway, pass- jurisdiction, etiquette etc. are continually cropping up; while the Indian colony are a very mixed lot, many of the Sikhs being in close touch with the Punjab Akalis. also the Rebate office, which handles sums running ofof rupees a year, to look after. It is not right that the Vice Consul, who has hitherto always been a Political proba tioner, should have all this difficult work and responsibility while the Consul, drawing twice his pay, sits at Sistan or Birjand M superin tending** him, and doing little else* 10. Sven if the railway service is discontinued, Duzdap is likely to remain a trade entrepot of some importance and the headquarters of the Governor of the Sarhad, the Commandant of the Sarhad garrison and other officials. The abandonment of the line west of Mirjawa, or even west of Dalbandin, will only cause a reduction in the trade of Duzdap, not its disappearance® A fair motor road exists, and camel transpdrt is plentiful. Aa it is, four-fifths of the merchandise has to be carried 600 miles by road to Meshed, and the extra 50 miles from Mirjawa, or even the 200 from Dalbandin, will not be fatal* 11. If the headquarters of the Consulate were transferred to Duzdap, a new Consulate would have to be built; but all the existing buildings, which are scattered round three of the sides of a large hollow square, could be utilized for offices and quarters, the Consul’s residence being built in the middle and the whole area enclosed within a high wall. 12. With regard to the reduction in the size of the Consulate establishment which I recommend, the following statement shows the existing strength and cost of the establishments at Sistan, Duzdap and Birjand, including the Rebate Office and the Trade Assistant’s Office at Duzdaps Consulate.

Bushire, the 3rd August 1931. thfhk. In these days of improved facilities for travel in Persia0 Persia by car and air, there could be fewer Consuls with larger districts provided they were given sufficient Travelling Allowance funds for getting about. 3. There are, however, two general considerations effecting the consular problem in Persia which I should like to touch on. The first is the fact that - in my opinion - the present condition of comparative law and order and strong central govern -ment in Persia is purely ephemeral. It depends on the life of one man, Reza Shah, and when that man dies, or falls from power- it may be tomorrow, it may be 5 or 10 years hence - Persia will once more be plunged into her normal state of unrest and weak government, perhaps a little worse than usual on account of various factors. You have touched on the ephemeral nature of the present administration in various of your letters, and the late Minister (Sir Robert Clive) has also hinted at it. Personally I have never met anyone in Persia, foreigner or Persian, (though naturally this is not a subject which one can discuss freely with the latter), who thought there was any real hope of strong government when Reza disappears. In considering what should be our consular representation in Persia I think we should keep this fact in mind, especially with regard to the proposal made in paragraph 5 below 4. The other consideration which I have to offer is with regard to the suggested move of the Residency to Bahrain. The present proposal is briefly that v/hen this occurs the Resident will still have the powers of an Inspecting Consul-General on the Persian side, but these powers according to the Foreign Office view amount to very little, and in practice - when the time comes to put them into practice - will, I think personally, amount to still less. The whole tone of the principal Foreign Office letter up to date dealing with the matter, (D.O.letter from Baxter, Foreign Office to Laithwaite, India Office, No. E.350/168/34 of 22nd January 1930) is unsatisfactory from our point of view. For ready reference I give some quotations from it: “ItCox - should cover the whole of the Persian coast from Moharmserah to the Indian frontier, including Ahwaz and Shiraz, hut excluding Kerman, which is not in the Gulf area at all and which should be surrendered to the Foreign Office. 6. The incumbent of the post (Consul-General, Bushire), though he would have to be a fairly senior officer, would be junior to the Resident at Bahrain, and it would be understood that in cases where Gulf matters in general, both Persian and Arab sides, were concerned, he should work in with the Political Resident. It is true that by this arrangement the shadow of the Inspector Generalship would be lost, but the substance in the shape of Government of India influence on the Persian side would be retained, and the Political Resident working with an officer of his own Department (the Consul-General at Bushire) would have, 1 think, far more actual - if indirect influence on Per sian affairs than 'inspecting' 3 or 4 officers, each with separate districts, the most senior of whom - the Consul General at Ahwaz (vide Ministers scheme) - would belong to a different service. 7. Due access of the Political Resident to all Persian ports, as under the Inspecting Consul-Generalship scheme, would of course still be a necessary corollary to my r® proposal* 8. It would be preferable, but not absolutely essential, that the Consular officers under the Consul-General should belong to the Indian Political Department. 9. There is of course no immediate hurry. It will be some years before the Bahrain Residency can materialise, but if my proposal&gt; with whatever modifications are considered necessary, is approved of then now would appear to be the time to put it forward. 10. If it is put forward it seems to me the Government of India would be on very firm ground. The Persians could not object to our continuing to have a Consul-General here as in the past, and the extent of his exequatur would be a matter for H.M.G. to decide. 11 /11 * Vis-a-vis the Foreign Office too, from ’whom objection might be expected on the grounds of the extent of the Consul- General^ exequatur, the position would be strong. It is common ground that the Government of India have paramount interests in South Persia, and prima facie there would be nothing unreason able in the demand that the consular control over the whole of this area, subject as now to the Minister, Tehran, should be in the hands of an officer of the Indian Political Department# 12 * From the important view of finance too the suggestion is certainly not more costly than ^ that proposed by the Minister* The A*P. 0 *C* have lately decreased their activities at Ahwaz, in the Fields and at jtiMoui Abadan. In the latter place they have dismissed many of their European employes, and of their workmen Indians and Persians, the idea being - I was informed by a senior A.P* 0 .C*official - to concentrate on their commitments in Iraq. This being so we would scarcely need to have a Consul- General in Khuzistan, (as suggested by the Minister), and our representatives in South Persia might be something as follows* Minister’s scheme.

My dear Howell, Will you please refer to your d.o*letter No.]?. 369 -N /30 dated 10 th August 19 31 to Powle regarding consular establish ments in Persia. I do not think there would be much object in deputing Barrett to visit consular posts in the Gulf. There are only two such posts? Mohammerah and Bunder Abbas. I have sent j?owle my general observations on the Minister’s despatch, by last air mail, and doubtless it will reach about the same time that this letter does. As regards Mohammerah, it is not necessary to add much to what I have said therein. I consider it essentially a post that should be filled from India, and it is a post in which no change of status is possible or suggested. It is only a Vice Consulate, and it is held by an Assistant Surgeon of the Indian Medical Dept, certainly the most economical arrangement possible. Speaking from memory, the clerical establishment consists of one English clerk, one vernacular clerk, and a passport clerk who is paid from passport fees and is, so to speak, self-supporting. This is clearly an absolutely minimum establishment. I will examine the Mohammerah budget on my return, but it is clear I think from the above that any economies that may be possible will be of a very petty and insignificant nature. As I have said in my previous letter however I see no necessity for the retention of the post of Vice-Consul at Ahwaz, at any rate from the Indian point of view, and I would recommend that it should be abolished. This would effect a material economy. As regardsAs regards Bunder Minister has suggested that it should he reduced to a Consular Agency or alternatively he held hy an Honorary Consul. This post, like Mohammerah, has also been held hy an Assistant Surgeon for many years past, and Minister does not specify exactly what ta he means hy the suggestion to reduce it*s status to a Consular Agency, Is it proposed that the Consular Agent should he an Indian, or a European? In the latter event there would he no saving, and even in the former the saving would he slight. The alternative proposal to appoint an Honorary Consul is I think financially preferable, hut as I stated in my previous letter, the only possible individual who could he appointed is the Manager of the local branch of the Imp. Bank of Persia. I doubt the Bank agreeing, hut I will sound the General Manager before I come out, and _if he agrees, the question might he considered. As regards the establishment, I cannot remember exactly what the Bundar Abbas office consists of, hut at most it is two clerks in the English office, and one in the vernacular. I will however look into the budget on my return, and see if any economies are possible. I do not think it would he possible to abolish the post. We must have someone there to xx visa passports of persons going to India; to assist the considerable local Hindu community and to take up with the local Governor minor difficulties encountered by the telegraph staffs at Jask, Charbar, Hen jam etc. To sum u p. (i) of the consular posts in the Persian Gulf, only one, that of Vice-Consul Ahwaz is held by an officer of the Political Dept. The other two Mohammerah and Bunder Abbas are both held hy Assistant Surgeons, with minimum clerical establishments. A very economical arrangement. (ii) I think that the post of Vice Consul Ahwaz might be abolished v/ith no detriment to Indian interests. (iii) There is no proposal to reduce the status of Mohammerah, andand it is difficult to conceive any more economical arrange ment for filling it than the existing one. (iv) If Bunder Ahbas were reduced to a Consular Agency, presumably the incumbent would be someone of more or less the same type as the present incumbent and there would be no appreciable saving in cost. The proposal to a.ppoint an Honorary Consul has more to commend it, but the only possible nominee is the Manager of the Imp. Bank of Persia, and the Bank usually decline to allow their officials to take up consular work, but I will ascertain from the General Manager whether he would make an exception in the present case, and if so what allowances would have to be given etc. I will also review the establishment budget.

This being so it may be more convenient to reply to your letter in the same manner ? My views - for what they are worth - can be ta^en as official. some general observations (paragraphs 2 and 3). You will see that he entirely agrees with me in the views I expressed as to the impermanence ol the present state of law ana order in this country. He further joins issue with sir Hobert Clive in the la.tter # s estimate of the comparative rates of pay drawn by officers of the Consular service and those of the Indian Political Depart consular representation can be considered under two aspects: (a) when, &amp;nd if, the Residency is moved to Bahrain; (b) under present conditions. ¥ ith regard to (a). sis Colonel Biscoe (paragraph 8 of his letter) points out the transfer of the Residency cannot taKe place in the neai future, and there would therefore seem to be no necessity to link any proposals for Bushire with proposals for Before going into aetails Colonel Biscoe maxes ment To come down to details.

On the subject of Meshed and Seis tan, Ahich I have some experience of having officiated at both places, I agree with Colonel Biscoe*s views - as given in his paragraph 4. 5. as regards Ke rma n - where I have dso officiated - personally 1 thinx that, especially in view oi the considerations mentioned in paragraph 2 above as to the impermanence of the present state of law and order in the country, Kims is tan is more important to the Government of India, and more in the Gulf area, than Kerman, and what I would suggest is that Kerman be given over to the Foreign Office in exchange lor Ahwaz (see paragraph 8 below). 6. For ^hwa z there is - in my opinion - no need for a Consul-General as suggested oy Sir Robert Clive. Our outstanding interest there is the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, but they - as 1 pointed out in my letter to Colonel Siscoe paragraph 12 - have greatly decreased their activities, &lt;and I have Just heard that the Imperial Banx of Persia have closed iheir branch ^t Maidan-i-haphtun (Oil fields) which existed merely for the Anglo-Persian Oil Company works.

T.C.Fowle*GOPY * ParK Hotel,Burgenstock 9 Near Lucerne,Switzerland* -Slst August 1931* Py dear Po^le Please refer to your D*0.No.491-S, dated 3rd August 1931, forwarding for my viefts a copy of letter P. 369-N/30, dated 28tii July 1931, from the Government of India in the Foreign and political Department regarding consular districts in Persia* ions with one or two general remarks. Firstly I entirely agree with the view expressed in paragraph 3 oi your letter that the present state ol law ana order ana strong centralised administration is Dy no means necessarily permanent. It depends, as you say, on the life of one man, and I personally have never met anyone in Persia who anticipated anything except an entire 'breakdown of the present regime sooner or later. It is obviously difficult for persons who have never seen Persi af except unaer present conditions to realise what it was lime formerly, and now easily it may revert to its former condition. I think therefore that we should 'be cautious in introducing sweeping changes or modifications in our consular establishment, which were built up gradually as the outcome of practical necessity^ and may prove necessary again. Once a post has been abolished or given up it will be dirficuit to re-establish it, and the ^oiicy therefore that I would advocate would we afrit be tu keep existing posts alive, but at a minimum cost, by appointing less highly- paid officers, and scrutinising in some cases allowances e tc« has referred and on which I should like to join i with I would like to premise my detailed observat There is one matter to which Sir Robert- 2 - with him, and that is his rei'ei'ence to the comparative rates ot pay drawn hy oiiicers of the Gonsuiai- Service and cl - the Indian Government Senior officers of the Political Department certainly draw higher pay (though not double) than officers of the Consular Service,hut in the junior raruxs, when cost of living bonus, and irais de representation, ana. the much more liberal passage allowances granted to officers of the Consular Service are taken into consideration, there is actually very little difference in the rates 01 pay, ana to talk of Indian officers drawing double the pay of their consular confreres is entirely inaccurate* 4 * I consider that Inaia has very real and definite interests in Southern and Sastern Persia: these interests are strategic, political, and commercial* North eastern Persia, including Meshed, and not merely Seistun is 01 strategic and political importance to Inaia, and the whole or British trade in that part of the world is in the hanas of Indian traders, of whom there are considerable numoers in Meshed: ana in addition it is of course an important place of pilgrimage for certain suctions of the Indian Mohammedan population, .ail trade m perGia ia Qr course more or less stagnant at present, owing to the restrictions recently introduced, but modifications will have to be made, ana we may certainly expect to see a trade revival in due course, and then Indian traders will doubtless resume their normal activities. With Indians, an Indian officer is certainly mere competent to deal than an officer of the Levant Service, and they naturally prefer dealing with someone * no speaks their language and Knows their customs, etc* Per the above reasons I would deprecate replacing the Indian oificer at M r eshed by on officer of the Levant Service. On the other hand I understand that some reduction-3 'Z c )( reduction has already heen ell'ected in the cost of the post and I think it might he possible, in vie«- 01 the urgent need for economy, to review some of the allowances granted to the incumbent* They were fixed when there was a large number of Russians to entertain there, u.nd when transport rates were much higher, and at that time Meshed was undoubtedly a most expensive post; but conditions have now changed* 5• As regards Kerman, I have already expressed the opinion that the post might suitably be held by a more junior officer than in the past, or even by an Assistant surgeon lixe Richardson, provided some care was taxen in his selection* There is not the same objection to handing over this post to the Levant Consular service there is in the case or Meshed, but as I have shown above, if a comparatively junior Indian officer was appointed his pay would not be appi ecicioiy £,1 eater than that o± a 1*6 van t officer* The post, even ii there is not much 'work to do tnere now, should certainly be kept •alive 1 , so to speax, as it embraces practically the whole of south-eastern Persia, an area with which we should not lose touch, and which in changed circumstances may be of considerable im portance • 6 - In para 5 of his despatch Sir R # Clive states that there are a large number of Indians employed by the A.P.O.C* in Khuzistan. This is no longer the case. As you point out the A.P.O.C. have virtually closed down Ahwaz and the number of Indians at Mohammerah and Abadan is very much greater than at Ahwaz. I am there fore strongly of opinion that Mohammerah should be retained oy an Indian officer* Pur the r the consular onicer at Mohammerah has many dealings with the passport4- and emigration authorities at Bomuay, and Vvith oll'icers on the Arab littoral, I have visited Hohammerah constant ly since I have been at Bushire, and speaK with personal knowledge ol‘ the vork there, and it is essentially a post that should he held hy an oll'icer ol' the Indian Service: the v.ork consists very largely of assisting and advising Indians, and dealing v. ith authorities in India and this an ofiicer of the Indian service is more competent to do than an officer of the Levant service* 7* oh the other hand I see no necessity for the retention of the post or Vice-Consul at ^hvaz, at any rate as far as Indian interests are concerned. There are not. few Indians there, and I should have thought that one oificer could have performed the duties of the post. If however it is considered desirable that the prospective Consul-General there should have an assistant, this might he found oy his own service. This is on the assumption of course that Mohammerah is held hy an Indian officer. 8. As regards Bushire, circumstances have now changed somewhat since Sir R.Clive left, and the Governorship of the Gulf ports has once again been made independent of Pars, and this can certainly he regarded as the normal arrangement. I know that Sardar-i-Intisar who temporarily held booh appointments felt that there were great difficulties in combining the two posts, and I doubt if the experiment will he repeated. In his despatch Sir R. Clive has suggested that when the Residency is transferred there should be a senior Consul at Bushire with a Vice-Consul at Busnire and another at Shiraz, while in the accompanying memorandum he( 2 %) -5- he has suggested that the consular oll'icer at uushira might be a Uonsul-Grenerai, ana you have supported the latter proposal. I thinK there is a good deal to he said lor the proposal, hut it really seems rather unnecessary to consider the matter at present. The transfer ol the ^Residency cannot take place in the very near future: the proposals involve no changes in the existing consular arrangements, and it will be time enough to consider the matter when the transfer has assumed a more definite form, ho changes are contemplated until the transfer taxes place, and it is always unwise to try and loom too far ahead in a country like Persia, and there would therefore seem to be no necessity to link any proposals lor Bushire with proposals for changes elsewhere, as Sir R.Olive points cut however Bushire and Shiraz have many points of contract ana common interests and I would therelore ta^e this opportunity of mentioning that while I think khuzistan might he excluded from the exequatur of the Consul-General at Bushire, Pars should continue to he included, in addition of course to the Persian littoral. 9. There only remains the question of Bandar X&amp; Abbas. The Minister suggests that it might be reduced to a Consular agency; in normal times however there is a large Indian colony at Bandar Abbas, and a considerable volume oi trade with the interior. The post has for many years past been held by an Assistant Surgeon, a satisfactory and economical arrangement and I would deprecate any change. The reduction of the post to a consular Agency would not ailect any very material economy, a further suggestion has been made to appoint a local Englishman as nonorary Consul: the only possible nominee however would be the local1 Local Manager of the imperial Bank oi Persia* 1 have always understood however that the BanK: did not li-^s their employes performing consular functions, and I think it would be difficult lor the Manager to combine the two posts. yours sincerely, Sd/- M.V.

F. 369-H/30 of 28th July asking for my views on the Ministers proposals so far as they affect the Meshed Consulate General. 2. Since I came to Meshed on 5th May 1930 I have spared no efforts to economise by reducing the Consulate establish ment. As soon as I had obtained sufficient acquaintance with the needs of the Consulate I abolished the post of stenograph® which had been created in 1928* when my office Superintendent went on leave in November 1930 I made no new appointment to fill the lea^e vacancy so that I might see whether the clerical establishment could be further reduced. Thanks to the efforts of the remaining clerks the work was carried on satisfactorily but i do not recommend the reduction as a permanent measure. Recently moreover the Wireless apparatus has been dismantled and the operator has returned to India. 3 .

It would probably be a convenience to call the military Attache (now Secretary) Vice Consul and to empower him to sign pass ports and perform consular duties in the absence of the Consul General, but he is a very hard worJked officer and I do not recommend that the duties of the vice Consul, which are mainly connected with British Trade interests should normally be transferred to him. ne has more than enough to do in his work for the military department. 4. Sir Robert Clive does not propose to abolish the post of Consul General, Meshed but suggests as the Military Attache* (Secretary) is an officer of the Indian Army that the Consul General should be a Levant officer. I regret that I do not share this view. I admit that my experience is limited to hush ire and Meshed but 1 should go so far as to say that because the secretary must be an officer of the Indian Army therefore the Consul General should be an officer of the Indian Political department. my experience is that officers working so closely together should owe the whole of their allegiance to the same Government. 5. Apart from this matter it should be noted that the interests of Meshed are wholly Indian. The staff with the exception of the Attache* is Indian, the trade interests are Indian. The number of British Companies is three i.e. the Imperial bank of Persia, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the Oriental Carpet Manufacturers. The European employes of the Oriental Carpet Manufacturers are both foreigners but they keep an Indian Clerk. Even the Anglo-Persian Oil CompaJhy imports its oil through India. 6 . It is true that there is a considerable amount of correspondence with the department of Overseas Trade, London and the Commercial secretariat at Tehran but, owing to the Persian Trade Monopoly Laws and other restrictions mentioned» 3 » by Sir Robert Clive in his paragraphs 5 and 8 and also the geographical situation of hhorasan, United Kingdom trade is practically non existent* Indian traders somehow manage to carry on though on a reduced scale# 7. ihe Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the Imperial Bank of Persia as mentioned in paragraph 6 of sir Robert Clive’s memorandum are big enough to go direct to the legation and ‘■'hey are in very little need of Consular assistance but this is not true of the Indian traders# .During the period I have been here my assistance v/ith the local authorities has constantly been invoked by Indian traders and pilgrims and in spite of the centralisation mentioned in paragraph 3 of Sir Robert Clive’s memorandum it has usually been fruitful* M.eshed is the holiest c^ty Ox Persia and the magnet which draws Shias of India in large numbers annually# It is the presence of these Indian pilgrims in fact which gives the Consul General the major portion of his work* 8# xhe reason for retaining the post of consul General in Meshed is wholly the interests of India. 'Ihese are much better placed in the hands of an officer of the Indian Political Department* ihe Khuaistsn post derives its importance from the presence of a big British oil company and its transfer to the levant Service is no precedent for the transfer oi i^esheu where conditions are totally dissimilar. 9* X agree with Sir Robert Clive that the post of vice Consul can be abolished but as the interests of this Consulate General are wholly Indian I consider that the Consul General should be a member of the Indian Service.

Copies of this despatch have been sent from here to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, the Consul-General at Meshed and the Consul in Sistan.

I have already Informed you of the action which has been taken here on Sir Robert Clive's despatch No, oil. i'he question of reduction in the status of various consular posts necessarily raises that of reduction in Consular establishments. As Sir Robert lias himself pointed out those Consulates which are manned by officers of the Indian Political Department had their scale of establishment drawn up while the capitulatory regime was still in force and in the altered conditions of the present time it seems possible that considerable economies might be effected. The best ray to arrive at a proper conclusion on this subject would in the opinion of the Government of India be to depute a senior officer of experience to visit each of the Consular Simla; The August 1931 postspoets eoBcemed, oxtc dro th3 existing establishmfcnts and submit his roooBKnriidatloas simltaneously to His Majesty's Legation at Tehran and to the Govern ment of India on the assumption : (a) that the reduction in the status of the posts suggested by Sir Robert Clive had been approved; (b) that no change in status had been made. If in his opinion some change in status other ttian that proposed by Sir Robert v/ere necessary, he could submit prooosrls accordingly and state what establish ment would be required to give effect to them. Barrett who teas shown considerable aptitude for reducing expenditure at Meshed under stress of the existing financial stringency might, it is thought, with advantage be deputed to undertake this duty at Sistan and Ken;an as well as Meshed. As regards the remainder of the posts with which the Government of India is connected. It is tnought that Biscoe might possibly prefer to undertake the task himself and the option is being put to him. It is of course beyond the province of the government of India to make any suggestion with regard to the remaining Consulates, but it is thought that if a uniform procedure were- 3 - adopted throughout Persia, it v.ould prohahljr he Justified by the results. as far as the Government of India are concern ed extreme financial stringency mderfit desirable not only tliat every possible source of ecaaowy be explored b?at that effect should be given to all reductions proposed as soon as possible.

Sir, I have the honour to submit herewith a report on existing Consular establishments in Persia together with an expression of my views in regard to reductions and economies which might in my opinion be made without loss of efficiency to the Public service. 2. I am unaware to what extent the Government of India hold to the appointment of Indian political officers to the Consulates in Eastern and South-eastern Persia, but under the very changed conditions of to-day with every thing centralised in Tehran and Consular jurisdiction a thing of the past it can hardly be said that there is the same necessity as formerly for Indian political officers to occupy so many posts, when it is considered that the rate of their emoluments is about double that paid to officers of the Levant Service. 3* At Meshed for instance so long as an Indian Army Officer continues under another title to do the work previously done by the so-called Military Attach^, I can not see that the public service would in any way suffer if the Consul-General were recruited from the Levant Service. On the other hand Sistan and Duzdap either or both - if both are retained - should in my opinion unquestionably be The Right Honourable Arthur Henderson, M.P., The Foreign Office.* be filled from the Indian Political service. The diffi culty appears to be that, whereas at Sistan there is an excellent Consulate, there is little to do there, while at Duzdap - so long as the railway continues - there is a considerable amount of work to do but most inadequate hous ing accommodation in a very unattractive place. 4. At Kerman again there is a most excellent Consulate but according to Colonel Noel, the last Consul, little or nothing to do there, while at Bander Abbas, which is now connected by road to Kerman, there is a superb Consulate but the work there is nothing like enough to justify the large expense of the establishment* 5. In Khuzistan if it is decided to raise the status of the Consul to Consul-General with two Vice-Consuls under him, one at Ahwaz and the other at Mohammerah, I consider that in future the Vice-Consul at Mohammerah should be from the Levant Consular Service and should in the absence of the Consul-General be acting Consul-General. The Indian Political Vice-Consul at Ahwaz is always a very junior officer but it seems advisable that he should continue to be recruited from the Indian Political service owing to the large number of Indians employed in Khuzistan by the Oil Company. 6. As to Bushire, once the Resident has moved to the other side of the Gulf, the importance of Bushire as a Consular post must to some extent tend to diminish. The present Governor-General now combines the offices of Governor-General for the province of Fars and Governor of the Gulf ports and divides his time between Bushire and Shiraz 7t\* thh J * J* V t* 'V &gt;*'“ k 'rt.Lw. ( u / 'A 4 (l ■ i-*S M , •9 /k 4 VtShiraz, hut the Persian Government have, for the time being at least, subordinated Bushire to Shiraz* There are sound arguments therefore for placing both posts in future under one Senior Consular Officer as in the case of the province of Khuzistan* Shiraz will always have a certain political importance while Bushire as the chief port in the Gulf and the future headquarters of the Perso-Italian Navy will continue to have a special interest for us even after the Resident has moved to the other side of the Gulf. A Consul at Bushire with possibly a Vice-Consul, and a Vice-Consul at Shiraz would appear however in future to be sufficient for the requirements of these two posts, the Consul dividing his time between the two places* 7* It is difficult nowadays to justify the maintenance of a Vice-Consul at Resht. Beyond a small branch of the Imperial Bank of Persia there is no British Colony and no British trade, while the Consul’s opportunities of obtaining any information of value about Russian activities are extremely limited. 8. Finally I have no doubt in my mind that as things are to-day the very limited amount of work at Ramadan and Kermanshah does not really justify the retention of a Consular officer de carriers at each of these places. 9. I am sending a copy of this despatch, with its enclosure, to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India• I have etc., (Signed) R.H. Clive.2 The British Consular establishment in Persia is on a very much larger scale than that maintained by ** any other Power, It is at the same time larger than before the War, 3. On the other hand with the abolition of the capitulatory regime and the enormously improved commun ications throughout Persia since the war, it appears to me that the continuance of a consular establishment on the present scale is difficult to justify either on uolitical or economic grounds. Consular officers no longer have the same intimate relations with the local Authorities and tribal chieftains as before the War, In those days the province of Khuzistan was semi-independent of the Central Government, while a letter from Tehran took up to a month to reach ohiraz and three weeks to reach Meshed. Conditions are now entirely changed. Centralisation is the watchword. Check is kept on the Civil Authorities in the provinces by the Military whose reports go straight to the Shah, while an ubiquitous gendarmerie and police force are in constant communication with Headquarters at Tehran, where an innocent tour of a Consular Officer is always apt to be misrepresented. 4. Nowadays Persians of all classes are warned against visiting the Legation and Consulates. Contact with foreigners in general is discouraged and a Persian can hardly enter a Legation or Consulate without the fact being known to the Police. 5. Again present Persian policy would appear to be \ directed/directed as far as possible to the elimination of foreign companies and agencies - in other words recent legislation is aimed at forcing foreign companies, if they wish to continue to do business in Persia, to form subsidiary Persian companies which would be subject solely to the local law with no claim to consular protection, end at the substitution of Persians for foreigners as agents of foreign trade concerns. 6 . The two important British institutions which have concessionary rights - the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the Imperial Bank of Persia - require but little Consular assistance. It is the Legation which has to defend their interests, when necessary, direct with the Persian Government. 7. The establishment of an T Iraqi Legation and Consulate in Tehran and Consulates at Kermanshah and Mohammerah has relieved the Consulates in those three places and at Hamadan of a great deal of work especially at Kermanshah and Mohammerah. 8 . Finally the restrictions imposed on trade by the recent Trade Monopoly Law have had the immediate effect of i educing imports by at least fifty per cent and no energy or initiative on the part of Consular Officers can in present conditions achieve much in the interest of British trade. 9. The lacrn ol work referred to in a recent reoort by His Majesty’s Consul at Kerman obviously applies in great measure to several other Consulates. 10 . In these circumstances I submit, in comparison with the establishment set forth at the beginning of this memorandum, what I consider to be the minimum establishiriRnt required. Consul-General/Meshed Consul-General (who might in future come from Levant Service) Consul-General (so soon as the Resident Bushire has moved his head- for the province quarters to the Arab of Pars and the or side of the Gulf)• Gulf Ports* Consul with Vice-Consul at Bushire Consul or Vice-Consul at Shiraz Consular Agent at Bander Abbas Consul-General with at Ahwaz for the Provir of Khuzistan. Vice-Consul at Ahwaz Vice-Consul at Mohammerah. Consul at Isfahan Consul at Tabriz. Consul for Sistan and Duzdap. Vice-Consul (who might well come frcmthe Levant Service). Kerman. Consul Vice-Consul (Personal Consul). for rank of Hamadan and Kermanshah (To reside at whichever place is considered most suitable). Tehran. 11* You will observe from the foregoing that I would propose:- (1) to reduce Isfahan to a Consulate. (2) to raise Ahwaz to Consulate-General. (3) to abolish consular posts at Sistan or Duzdap, ReshtResht and either Ramadan or Kermanshah. (4) to reduce Shiraz and Kerman to Vice-Consutes. (So far as Kerman is concerned it seems open to question whether we need to maintain even a Vice-Consulate). (5) to reduce Bander Abbas from a Vice-Consulate to a post with a Consular Agent or else to appoint a local Englishman as Honorary Consul. (6) to abolish Vice-Consular post at Meshed. The newly appointed ’’Secretary to the Consul-General”, who will replace the former Military Attache, could very well undertake the work hitherto done by the Vice-Consul. R.H. CLIVE.

Colonel Howard-Bury, — To ask the Secretary to the Overseas Trade Department, whether, seeing that there are already 29 consuls-general and vice-consuls in Persia, that an additional one is being proposed, and that already there are more consuls in Persia than there are in Germany, whereas our trade with Persia is only one-fortieth of our trade with Germany, he will increase our consular representation in Germany or reduce our over -representation in Persia [deferred till Monday \0th Mar ch~\ . For information. W. T. OTTFWILL. 53. Colonel HOWARD-BURY asked the Secretary to the Overseas Trade Depart ment whether seeing that there are already 29 Consuls-general and Vice- Consuls in Persia, that an additional one is being proposed, and that already there are more Consuls in Persia than there are in Germany, whereas our trade with Persia is only one-fortieth of our trade with Germany, he will increase our Con sular representation in Germany or re duce our over-representation in Persia 1 Mr. GILLETT: The number of Con suls necessary to afford adequate protec tion for British subjects and trade must vary in different countries and circum stances. It must, for example, depend not only on the volume of trade, but on such factors as distances, means of com munication, difficulty of language, and climate. The new appointment in Persia is that of a commercial diplomatic officer and not a Consular officer. In Germany there are already two commercial diplo matic officers. Colonel HOWARD-BURY: Is the hon. Gentleman awar.e that the chief work at the present time is for our Consuls to find work for themselves, and, as our trade with Germany is far greater than our trade with Persia, cannot he send some of those redundant Consuls to Germany 1 Captain CAZALET : Is it not a fact that many of these Vice-Consuls are purely nominal Vice-Consuls? Mr. GILLETT : I do not think that that is so. I think that these are men on the staff, and that the hon. and gallant Mem ber who put down the question has not realised that a certain number of them are employed really by the Government of inula, and that the Government of India find their pay. Colonel HOWARD-BURY: Is the hon. Gentleman aware that there is practically no work for the m to do ? P.B. Form No. 3. 2 5 5 til! 1000 2.28-' lem- i -- — ■I : @) Department. PARLIAMENT ART NOTICE.
