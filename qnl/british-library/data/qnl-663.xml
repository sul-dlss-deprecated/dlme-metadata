T3. P. 5:;93/28: Precis of the Treaties and Engagements between the British Government and the Chiefs of the Arabian Coast of the Persian Gulf. (a) Agreement dated 23rd January 1899.—The Sheikh pledged himself and his neirs and successors not to receive the Agent or Representative of p. 2686/26. any 1 ower or Government at Koweit . . . without the previous sanction of the British Government . . . and not to cede, se]J, lease or mortgage or give for occupation or for any other purpose any portion of his territory to the Government or subjects of any other Power, without the previous consent of His Majesty’s Government. (b) Letter from Lieut.-Col. Meade, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, to the Sheikh of Koweit, dated 23rd January 1899, accompanying (a):—The Sheikh was formally assured “ ot the good offices of the British Government towaids you, your heirs and successors as long as you, vour heirs and successors scrupulously and faithfully observe the conditions of the said bond (i.e. the agreement above).” Note. In 1911, when the text of the Agreement of 1899 was com- P.4536/11 municated to the J urkish Government, the text of Col. Meade s accompanying letter was not similarly communicated ; but the Turkish Government was told in Sir E. Grey’s covering note that “His Majesty’s Government have informed the Sheikh of Koweit that so long as he and his heirs and successors act up to their obligations under the Agreement, His Majesty’s Government undertake to support them and accord them their good offices. His Majesty’s Government reserve to themselves the right to interpret that term at their disci etion. 1 lie attitude adopted at the time by His Majestv’s Government towards this undertaking is illustrated by the following extract from India Office letter dated the 30th October 1911 to the Foreign Office :—“The term p. 1446/11 ‘ good offices ’ . . . is a conveniently vague one, and Lord Crewe is of opinion that it is neither necessary nor safe to go beyond it. The action taken by His Majesty’s Government in 1901-2, when men and guns were landed at Koweit to defend it against unprovoked Turkish aggression, will, moieovei, ha\e made it plain to the Porte in what way we are prepared to interpret the term if necessity arises.” (c) Agreement of the Sheikh of Koweit, dated 24th May 1900, to prohibit the importation of arms into, and their exportation from, Koweit. (d) Postal Agreement, dated 28th February 1904, giviug His Majesty’s Government the sole right to erect a post office at Koweit. (e) Secret Agreement, dated 15th October 1907, for the lease of the Bunder Shweikh foreshore.-In the fifth article of the two documents constituting the agreement the Sheikh reaffirmed his pledge not to cede, sell, Ac., any Koweit territory to any foreign Government or foreign subject without His Majesty’s Government’s permission. In the ninth, the British Government promised that “the town of Koweit and its boundaries belong to . . . the Sheikh of Koweit and to his heirs after him, and that all Sheikh Mubarak’s arrangements in the matter of customs Ac., and his arrangements at the present dav shall remain in the hands of Sheikh Mubarak-as-Subah, ruler of Koweit, and his heirs after Note.— The lease, or rather the payment of rent for the Bunder Shweikh site, was terminated in 1922. It does not appear, however, that the agreement was abrogated, and the reciprocal pledges, so far as they are not affected by other subsequent instruments, presumably remain binding. 3138 75 10.28 KOWEIT.

' (/) In 1898 the Sheikh of Bahrein signed an agreement to prohibit the traffic in arms in Bahrein territory.(rj) In 1911 the Sheikh agreed not to allow any foreign Power to open a Post Oilice in Bahrein, and not to grant a pearl fishing or sponge fishing concession to foreigners. In 1914 he agreed not to search for oil himself or give others permission to do so without consulting the Political Agent and receiving the approval of the Government of India. EL-KATR. (a) In 1868, as a result of hostilities initiated in Katr by the Sheikh of Bahrein in co-operation with the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, and continued by a retaliatory attack on Bahrein by Katr, Sheikh Mahomed bin Thani executed an agreement to abstain from hostilities and to accept the arbitration of the Resident, particularly in disputes as to the tribute payable to the Sheikh of Bahrein, to whom the Sheikhs of Katr were then in some degree subordinated. (b) Shortly after, the Turks established themselves in Katr; and though the British authorities did not hesitate to have direct dealings with the Sheikhs of Katr, no written agreement was made with them. (c) In the course of the negotiations with the Turkish Government in 1913 it was agreed that the southern and eastern limit of “ le Sandjuk Ottoman •de Nedjd” should be a “ une ligne partant du fond extreme du golfe faisant face a Pile de Zahnounie (i.e. the Bay of Salwa to the west of El Katr) qui ira directement au sud jusqu’au Ruba’-al-Khafi et separera le Nedjd de la presqu’-ile de PEl-Katr.” Further, it was agreed that “ le Gouvernement de Sa Majeste Britannique—ne permettra pas au cheikh de Bahrein de s’immiscer dans les affaires interieures d’el-Katr, de porter atteinte a Pautonomie de ce pays ou de Pannexer.” (d) The separation of El Katr from Nejd and its independence of Bahrein having been thus established (though not thereby given effect), the way was open for the conclusion of a Treaty signed on 3rd November 1916 after the Turks had finally been expelled from El-Katr in the course of the war. In this treaty the Sheikh takes note of, undertakes the obligations resulting from, and is promised the advantages accruing from the various engagements concluded by the Trucial Chiefs for the suppression of slave trade and piracy and the preservation of the maritime peace. In Article III he undertakes to prohibit arms trade in Katr and to observe the arms traffic rules of the British Government. In Articles IV and V he undertakes to have no relations with the Agent of any other Power without the consent of the British Government, or to cede land by lease, sale or gift or to grant monopolies, concessions or cable landing rights. In Articles VII, VIII and IX he undertakes to protect British residents and, if required, receive a British representative, and establish a British post and telegraph office. In return the British Government undertakes in Articles X and XI to protect the Sheikh, his subjects and territory from all aggression by sea, and to grant their good offices should he or his subjects be assailed by land within the territories of Qatar ; it being understood that this obligation only applies in the event of such aggression by land or by sea being unprovoked by the Sheikh or his subjects. Note. —From para. 10 of the Memorandum on the Trucial Chiefs on P- 11 it will be seen that on the question being raised by the Sheikh in 1922 of the assistance which he might expect from Government in the event of an attack by Ibn Sand, he was informed that His Majesty’s Government were not prepared to promise more than diplomatic assistance. TRUCIAL COAST (Ras-ul-Khaima, Abu Dhabi, Dabai, Shargah, Ajman, Umm al Qaiwain). (a) In 1820 these chiefs signed the general treaty (see Bahrein (a)) prescribing perpetual abstention from plunder and piracy by land and sea. and from irregular (i.e. unproclaimed) war; registration of dhows; peace with the British Government; abstention from the carrying off or transport of slaves; free entry of their ships into British ports; “and if any shall attack them the British Government shall take notice of it.” * * “ Them ” in the context appeals to mean the ships of the signatory Chiefs; but it may mean the Chiefs.(6) Jn 1838, 1830 and 1847 agreements were entered into by these Chiefs for the suppression of slave trade, and for the search and,'if necessary, seizure by British warships of any of their vessels suspected of en^adn^ in this trade. ^ 6 * (c) In 1843 a Maritime J nice for ten years was signed by these Chiefs “ being fully impressed with a sense of the evil consequences arising from our subjects and dependents being prevented from carrying on the pearl fishery without interruption on the banks, owing to the various feuds existing among ourselves.” This Truce cancelled the right of the Chiefs implied in the general Treaty of 1820, to wage regular war on each other! Under the Truce they agreed to refer disputes and cases of aggression to the decision of the Political Resident. In 1853 the Truce was renewed in perpetuity. (d) In 1892 exclusive agreements were signed by all the Trucial Chiefs, on behalf of themselves, their heirs and successors, that they will on no account enter into any agreement or correspondence with any Power other than the British Government; that without the consent of the British Government they will not consent to the residence in their territories of the agent of any other Government; and that they will on no account cede, sell, mortgage, or otherwise give for occupation, any part of their territories, save to the British Government. (e) hi 1902 the Chiefs undertook to prohibit the importation of arms into and their exportation from their territories. (/) In 1911 the Sheikhs undertook not to give pearling or sponge fishino- concessions, save with the prior approval of His Majesty’s Government. (g) In 1922 similar undertakings were given regarding oil. OMAN (MUSCAT). (i) Treaties and Agreements with Great Britain. (a) Treaty relations date from 1798, when an agreement was made by the Imam with the East India Company to exclude the French and Dutch from his territories “whilst warfare shall continue between the English Company and them.” ° 1 ‘ ‘ (b) In 1822 a Treaty for Suppression of the Slave Trade was simied providing inter alia for action by the Imam’s officers in Muscat territor^, and for seizure, outside certain limits, by the British of any vessels carrying slaves to Christian countries. In 1839 a Commercial Treaty was concluded on a reciprocal most favoured-nation basis, providing for the purchase, sale or hire of lands by British subjects in Muscat territory, appointment of Consuls, protection of Muscat subjects in British employ, extraterritoriality for British subjects unrestricted trade, limitation of import duties to 5 per cent, and freedom from export duties. (d) In 1839 and 1845 further enactments reinforced the right of British vessels to detain and search and if necessary confiscate Muscat ships suspected of carrying slaves, outside certain limits. F (ej In 1862 an Anglo-French Declaration was signed under which the French Government and Her Majesty’s Government engaged reciprocally to respect the independence of the Sultans of Muscat and Zanzibar. (/) In 1864 the Sultan agreed to permit the construction of, and to protect one or more telegraph lines in his own territories or in those leased by him from Persia. But no sovereign right was to be conferred on the British Government over any such territory. This was followed in 1865 by a similar convention in respect of His Highness’ territories in Arabia and Mekran (g) In 1873 a further Treaty for the Abolition of the Slave Trade was concluded. This extended the powers of seizure possessed by British vessels to include seizure of Muscat vessels trading between Muscat ports- the Sultan undertook to shut all slave markets in his dominions and to protect liberated slaves. (/t) In 1891 a new Treaty of Commerce, Friendship and Navigation was concluded, which cancelled the Treaty of 1839, but was framed on similar lines. Coals, provisions, &amp;c., for Her Majesty’s ships were to be exempt from duty (Art 6). No export duties were to be levied without the consent of Her Majesty s Government. This treaty, like that of 1839, provided a capitulatory regime for British subjects.(i) In 1891 an agreement was also signed by the Sultan, pledging him never to cede, sell, mortgage or otherwise give in occupation any of his dominions or dependencies, save to the British Government. (;) In 1895 a guarantee was given to the Sultan that, whatever the differences between the Sheikhs of Oman and the Sultan, Government would not allow the former to attack the two towns of Muscat and Mattrah. The Sultan issued a notification in these terms. The warning was renewed in 1913. (k) In 1898 a proclamation was issued giving British and Persian vessels the right to search British, Persian or Muscat vessels in Muscat waters, and Muscat vessels in British or Persian waters, for arms and ammunition. (£) In 1902 the Sultan undertook to grant His Majesty’s Government the first option on mining rights in the Sur coalfields. (m) In 1903 the Sultan issued a notification authorising the searching by British and Italian ships, both on the high seas and in Muscat waters, of Muscat vessels suspected of carrying arms to certain prohibited African areas. (n) In 1923 the Sultan undertook not to give any oil concession without the consent of His Majesty’s Government. (ii) Treaties with other Powers. (а) In 1833 the Sultan concluded a Treaty of Amity and Commerce with the United States of America providing for perpetual peace, unrestricted trading (except that muskets and ammunition might not be sold to private persons in Zanzibar), limitation of import duties to 5 per cent., reciprocal most-favoured-nation treatment in regard to trading charges, and appointment of consuls. (б) In 1844 a Treaty of Commerce was concluded with France in terms almost identical with the British Treaty of 1839. (c) In 1877 a short Treaty with Holland provided reciprocal most-favoured nation treatment for the nationals of each country, both generally and in respect of import duty and the regulations regarding export and transit.
