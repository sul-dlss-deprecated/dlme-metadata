Grounds for Manumission. (!) Enslavement after March 1882, the date of execution of Slave Tradfl Agreement with Persia. (ii) Gross ill-treatment by master, in case of individual enslaved before Treaty. Procedure, Slave cases fall under four categories:— (i) Slaves of Persian masters domiciled in Persia. These should be referred officially to the Local Government or Karsmzar with a Consulate representative, if necessary, and a statement of the case and a manumission certificate obtained from the Local Government, or the Kareuzar on the strength of which a British manumission certificate is issued and the Persian one filed. We cannot ordinarily manumit without the consent of the Persian author ities, but if the slave Is not entitled to his freedom or if his title to be manu mitted is doubtful, His Majesty's Consular Officer should move the Local Government, or the Karguzar- to obtain, or himself obtain, a guarantee for good treatment from the slave's master and induce the slave to return to his owner on the strength of it. In instances of doubt or if the Local Government or the Karguzar make unnecessary difficulty, the case should be referred to the Residency. (ii) Slaves from Maskat, Bahrain, Kuwait or Trucial Coast. Political Officer should refer to Residency, giving the fullest possible details and permitting the slave to remain in the Consulate meanwhile. (iii) Slaves of masters who are domiciled in Persian territory, .but who are under British protection. Case should be enquired into and dealt with on its merits {but without the intervention of the Persian authorities). (iv) Slaves of masters who are domiciled in Persian territory i hut mho are not under British protection. Case should in the first instance be dealt with in communication with the Consul of the owner of the slave if one is present, otherwise the local authorities should be called upon to act as in the case of slaves of Persian masters; vide (i), supra.

If the case is one of real cruelty the ShaTkb should if feasible be invited to acquiesce m bis manumission, inference to higher authority need only be made in flagrant cases in which the Shaikh has failed to give reasonable relief. In the case of a slave belonging to a master not domiciled in Kuwait the slave should ordinarily be passed on to Bushire, or, if this is not practicable, a report of the case should be forwarded to the Eesidency for orders, the slave being given protection in the meanwhile. II.—B ahrain. Authority* Engagement of 1856 with the Chief of Bahrain (Aitchison, page 158, .. volume XII). Procedure. 1 All negroes claiming to be slaves and seeking manumission are received under the protection of tbe Agency. Males are lodged in the Agency premises under the charge of the guard. Women are as a rule put up outside in the quarter of the Free Slaves, for which they make their own arrange- ments. 2 There is only one exception to the grant of refuge to slaves, and that is in tbe case of those hailing from Kuwait. There are objections in such cases to charging to Government the cost of the passage of a negro sent back to Kuwait; the best plan is to endeavour to avoid tbe necessity of doing so by informing the slave that he cannot be given a manumission certificate and that if he remains in the Agency and his master claims him, he will bave to be sent to Kuwait in order that his case may be enquired into, and that ma best course under the circumstances is to make himself scarce. Kuwait slaves are, therefore, not considered in what follows. 3. Slaves fall under two classes according to whether their masters reside in Bahrain, or abroad.In the first case, that of 'Bahrain Slaves each application is dealt with in accordance with the principle laid down in Poreign Department letter No. 3551 E.-B., dated 4th September 1905, in which the attitude of Govern ment in regard to the treatment of slavery in Bahrain was defined. In this letter the Government of India laid down the following principles for the guidance of the Political Agent:— (1) That no effort should he spared to detect and suppress fresh importa tions of slaves into the island. (2) That in the case of newly-imported slaves or of slaves who have been subjected to ill-treatment by their masters, every facility should be afforded them for obtaining manumission papers. (3) That, save in case of ill-treatment, no encouragement to apply for their freedom should be offered to the numerous slaves who are reported to have been long domiciled in the island. (4) That in the event of slaves of long domicile applying of their own accord for manumission, each case should be considered on its merits, due regard being had to the period which may have elapsed since importation, the reasons assigned for not claiming manumission at an earlier date, the treatment accorded in the past by the slave's master, the owner's willingness to furnish guarantees for proper treatment in the future, and, finally, the importance on general grounds of avoiding any widespread unrest among those who have acquiesced in their lot and whose sudden manumission in considerable numbers might constitute a serious source of embarrassment. The Shaikh is only consulted, and only wishes to be'consulted, in special cases: in cases of deadlock or particular difficulty, reference should be made to the Hesidency. By general consent the year 1895 ( &lt;( The year of Zubarah ') is taken as the criterion for determining whether importation is ' new ' or 'old ^ 4. In the second case, that of ' Foreign Slaves chiefly from Trucial Oman* Katar and Turkish Arabia, the applicants' statements are taken and reference is made to the Political liesident. In a few cases in the past, however, the masters have turned up and have consented to the grant of Manumission Certificates which have accordindv been issued, to save time, by the Bahrain Agency. In such cases the master is usually seeking to record a claim and to enable him to establish his rights, asserts 'that the man has never been his slave or has long since been manumitted. This may sometimes be true, but it is usually expedient to strengthen the 'slave's' position by giving him a Manumission Certificate. # ^ ^ Occasionally a foreign slave comes to terms with his master and voluntarily returns with him. . ., , e a i As a general rule, however, all Foreign Slave cases should be referred to the Political Resident and disposed of in accordance with instructions received from him. III.—M askat. Authority* Treaty with the Sultan of Maskat, 1873 (Ajtchison, volume XII, para- graph 230). , .^-1 • * ^ Manumission Certificates are only granted with the acquiescence of fte Sultan after joint investigation by His Highness and the Political Agent. His Highness is not a party to the Brussels Act of 1890. Procedure. When a slave applies for freedom at the Agency bis statement is taken flownin writing. He is then sent to the Sultan with the Agency Munsbl lor fhJ^nrn^e of verifying his statement made at the Agency and of obtaining the consent of His Highness to bis freedom. The Sultan after questioning the4 slave either informs the Munshi that the slave may be freed, when he finds him to be of recent importation or of date subsequent to the Treaty of 1873, or in doubtful cases, when the date of the slave's importation cannot be clearly ascertained, His Highness requests that the slave maybe detained for from 10 to 15 days pending further investigation or the arrival of his master. In the now rare cases of slaves imported before 1873 claiming freedom, the Sultan is not asked to agree to their manumission unless cruelty or inhuman treatment is proved, in which case freedom is given with the consent of the Sultan ; otherwise when slaves not entitled to freedom under the treaty, appear to be well fed and clothed and in good condition, they are returned to their masters by the Sultan, who causes the masters to sign a bond by which they undertake to treat the slaves thus returned with kindness. In the event of British Indian subjects or subjects of Native States taking refuge in the Maskat Agency from a state of pseudo slavery, their free dom has been demanded, as of right, from His Highness and admitted by him as a matter of course, on the principle that the reduction of such persons to a state of slavery can under no circumstances be legal. Of this category the most likely case to occur is that of indigent Baluchis from Kalat-Mekran, IV.—Trucial Coast. Authority. Agreement of 1847, re-affirmed in the case of the Chiefs of Shargah and Abu Dhabi in 1873 (Aitchison, volume XII, pages 178 and 184). Procedure. Certificates are granted by or on the specific authority of the Hesident after investigation, on report by the Native Residency Agent, and after consideration of the views of the Shaikh concerned when such are put forward. General Notes, (i) Experience shows that there is a disposition to use the word ' slave ' as a synonym for ' negro' in correspondence. This should be avoided. There is a large free negro population in the Gulf and it does not at all follow that because a man is a negro he is necessarily a slave, nor is the converse the case, viz., that a slave is necessarily a negro. He may be a Mekrani or an individual of other denomination. (ii) If a slave has served his master for a long time, the probability is that the cause of his desire for freedom is of recent origin, and as it is very seldom that a negro slave can really be repatriated in practice, it is often more in his interest that a reconciliation be effected between master and slave by the execution of an undertaking from the former to meet the slave's wishes in some particular respect and treat him better. (iii) As regards negroes who claim to be slaves, care should be taken to ascertain that they are really bonded slaves and not free men and pearl divers who have run away to evade the liabilities which they so readily incur. It oi the toiuner category they should be dealt with as above indicated, but if the latter, arrangements should be made whenever possible to have the claims •against^them decided by a Salifa Court, according to the usages of the nearl diving industry. D In this connection reference is invited to the Trucial Coast Pearl Divers • Not with this. Agreement, 1879 (copy attached*). i l v) Sub-offices should not corresponu^a this connection direct with the Residency Agent at Shargah except inforrJiaily and on purely routine matters. Cases involving discussion should be referred to this Residency. ^ . dn * wn to tlle fact that a sla ve does not properly speaking become a British subject or protege merely by reason of his having been freed aothLfrorfthan IT ' 'f T\. ^ Britisb Manumission Certificate is g moie than it purports to be, as now worded, and the bearer of one is% % only entitled to our assistance in the case o£ interference with his liberty The impression which appears to exist in some ports that a British manumitted slave becomes a British subject ipso may be in the slave's interests and need not be actively dispelled, but it will not hold water if challenged. There is no objection, however, to giving a deserving individual holding a C&lt; ; rtl ^ ate .&gt;, friendly offices as a special case and to the extent to which the local authorities will accept them. (vi) Subsistence allowance at the rate of not more than four annas a day he granted to slaves whose cases are under consideration, at the discretion 0 i fj i ? ^r®* The cost of food and of repatriation when necessary should be drawn on a separate bill and attached to the monthly cash account sent to the Comptroller, India Treasuries, Calcutta. (vii) In cases of persons born in slavery (known as ' Muwallid' or domestic slaves) good offices can only be given in circumstances of gross ill-treatment with a view to the extraction of a guarantee from their masters that the ill-treatment shall cease. They are in no case entitled to a Manumission Certificate; on the other hand we are under no obligation to assist their masters to recover them. It should be remembered in this connec tion that domestic slavery is not prohibited in Turkey under the Brussels Act. A domestic slave is one born in slavery, one or both of the parents being: at the time bonded slaves. (viii) Emancipated slaves, who can work as field labourers, porters, &amp;c., but not those of the domestic class, may be sent to Zanzibar in direct com munication with His Majesty's Agent and Oonsul-General at that place ; in such cases all charges, which should of course be kept as low as possible and should not exceed Us. 50, in each case, will be borne by Government. The funds required may be drawn on separate bills and submitted with the monthly account to the audit officer concerned. if necessary, be sent by native craft, sailing Zanzibar, His Majesty's Agent at that place their despatch; if, however, native sailing craft are not available, emancipated slaves may be sent to Zanzibar via Bombay by steamer, the cost, which dated should not exceed about Rs. 50, being debited as described above [note (vi)]. The above procedure can be applied to all ports under the Persian Gulf Hesidency. (ix) Whilst a slave from Persia or from the Arabian shore of the Gulf, not otherwise entitled to his freedom, becomes ipso facto free on setting foot in British India, it has been held that if he returns of his own free will to the Foreign Department letter No. 164i7 E.-A., dated plaCC wheiC he Was formClly domiciled, the 6th September 1892. he reverts to his original status of slavery. (x) It was held in 1896 by the Advocate-General to the Government of Bombay in the case of the seizure of a slave dhow on the high seas by Captain F. G. Beville, Political Agent, Maskat, that the capture was probably illegal because section 3 of the Slave Trade Act of 1873 only authorises seizure by the Commander or Officer of any of His Majesty's ships. (xi) Refund of expenditure. —When a slave is restored to his owner, either because he is not entitled to manumission or as the result of a reconci liation effected between him and his master, the expenses of returning him (including cost of his feed and keep) should be notified direct to the Consular Officer concerned with a view to its recovery from the owner. In the case of refugees from the Trucial Coast the cost is treated as a first charge on the man's earnings and will be recovered and refunded direct by the E/esidency Agent in due course. Emancipated slaves may, under the British flag to being advised by post of Foreign Department letter No. 145 E.-A., dated the 16th January 1900. Foreign Department letter No. 2142 E.-A., dated the 30th October 1900- Foreign Department letter No. 918 E.-A the 8th May 1903. T6 (xii) Should civil claims or criminal complaints be preferred against a refugee, as sometimes occurs, the following procedure should be observed— (a) Civil claims— (i) If the claim is connected with pearling transactions, it should be referred to the Salifa Court at the place where the transaction took place. (ii) If it is an ordinary claim for a loan, &amp;c., it should be referred to a Civil Court of a Kazi, preferably a Kazi acceptable to both parties. In both cases a representative of the Agency or Consulate concerned should be present. {b) Criminal complaints— The refugee should first be freed if he or she is entitled to freedom and then the complaint should be enquired into and settled un officially, if possible. If this cannot be done, the case should be referred to a Shera or Consular Court or the local Adliyeh according to the nationality of the complainant. In the local court a representative of the Agency or Consulate should be present at the enquiry. It should be borne in mind, however, that no claim for debt can lie against a person undoubtedly in state of bonded slavery. (xiii) In the case of minors released from slavery, both in their own interests and in order to save expense, the Political^ Agent may at his discretion consign individuals during the years of their minority to the guardianship of approved applicants, almost invariably Christians, to be brought up as domestic servants, the said applicants executing a bond in which they guarantee to produce their charges whenever required and give such other undertakings in respect of them as the particular circumstances of the case may render expedient.

Abstraco of Customary Rules in use at Bahrain, Kuwait, Lingeh and the Trucial Coast for the settlement of cases arising out of the Pearling Industry. C5 bfd \A RUIES RESTRICTING MOVEMENT FROM ONE TOWN TO ANOTHER OF INDEBTED NAKHUDA AND DIVERS, AND WORK BY DIVERS DURING THE OFF SEASON. Rule 1. A Nakhuda before leaving a town for good must pay his own debts. Before leaving his original town a Nakhuda must pay all debts due from him there, and unless he has done so, he must return to his original town at the end of a voyage or a pearling season. Payment must be made as provided by Rule 19. Bahrain Note ;— 'If the sailors wish to leave the Nakhudas, they can get ' barwahs' 3 and get employment with other Nakhudas. ' Kuwait Note ;— ' Should the Nakhuda remove himself to another town, and should he have sailors owing money to him in his original town, he must appoint an agent to recover his dues and authorise him to issue ' barwahs ' to the sailors, whom he cannot compel to pay up at once. The Nakhuda is not required to arrange for their subsistence nor are the sailors required to embark in the Nakhuda's boats at his new town. If the sailors or their new Nakhuda cannot pay their dues in full, then arrangements must be made to pay them by instalments.' Rule 2. Responsibilities of a Nakhuda leaving a town towards his sailors who remain there. Should a Nakhuda leave his town, he should arrange for the subsistence of any sailors of his resident there, by giving them' tisqam ' 1 or ' salaf ' 2 ; if he does so, the sailors are bound to embark on the said Nakhuda's vessels at the commencement of the pearling season, wherever he may be, and to dive as usual according to the pterins of their original agreement with him. 1 ' Tisqam ' = an advance given to a diver in the off season about November or December when the divers have lost all their money and are getting hard-up. 2 ' Salaf 11 = an advance given to sailors about ten days before the commencement of the pearling season. 8 Vide paragraph 24 for definition.• 1 Ti«c\a.'ncx = «.w *».c\v€MXCO von t-«» r*. &lt;\iv&lt;t irx off «c»»s&lt;&gt;rx N'&lt;&gt;vorrxl^or or I&gt;ocor«i.l&gt;ft x. •• = n.« privoxx w.-.ilor^ «.V&gt;oTxt&gt; t«,x ci,.-y« lj»c&gt;Cor« t.lxc&gt; o&lt;3mxn.&lt;&gt;ncomon.«&gt; o£ fcli-o i&gt;oa.x-Ax.»«, S ott.in&amp; hc.rd-izjp.

Chief of town to diange for proportionate pay ment to his creditors by indebted sailors. Provided that a sailor is free from debt, he is his own master at the end of a diving season and is free to go where he likes. But (1) the receipt of ' tisqam ' by a sailor during the off season binds him to serve with the Nakhuda who paid it to him 'during the coming season, subject to Rule 9. (2) Once his accounts have been made up at the com mencement of a diving season, and a ' barwah' signed, he is bound to proceed to work on the terms agreed on, and cannot leave his employ er. Nakhuda A has a claim against sailor B, who also owes money to other persons C c, not Nakhudas. When the pearling season comes on C c cannot detain B unless they pay A's claim, which has priority. If in the above case B has many creditors, the Chief of the town should take a portion of B's income and make a'proportionate distribution of it to his credit ors. Note. —A sailor's income consists practically of the ' salaf ' and ' khatm ' 1 he receives from his Nakhuda, both of which, or a proportion of which, can be taken by the Chief. Bahrain Note :■—• ' If the sailor has been paid ' tisqam ' they cannot stop him from going. ' Kuwait Note:— ' Nakhuda A will guarantee that C c will eventually be paid at the end of the season from the sailor's earnings if such an agreement has previously been made.

Nakhuda A has a claim against sailor B ; Nakhuda C desires to employ B in the off season on the Red Sea pearl-banks or otherwise. B dies, or absconds, or does not return in time for the Gulf Fishery. Shargah Note:— ' B is at liberty to proceed to the Red Sea Fisheries or elsewhere, because a sailor is free on the termina tion of the Gulf Pearling Season. Bahrain Note :— ' If B has been paid ' tisqam' by A he cannot go, and in no case can C take 1 .im without A s consent *, A would probably ask him to guarantee B's debts before consenting. ' Kuwait Note:— ' C must pay A's claims against B. ' ' Permission to an indebted diver to go on a deep sea voyage would only be given on condition that he returns in time for the deep sea voyage. ' Shargah Note ;— ' C is not answerable to A for B's debts unless he misses the Gulf fishery owing to his having been detained by C, in which case (unless he had A's permission to take away B) he is responsible. G is likewise not answerable if B is detained owing to circumstances beyond C's control, such as a war between two Powers. ' Nakhuda A has diving claims against sailor B, who during the off season takes service locally on a fixed wage with Nakhuda C. When the pearling season comes round C cannot detain B, even if B is in his debt, unless he pays A's claim against B. If B has received ' tisqam ' from A he must go pearling with him and C cannot release him by pay ment of that debt. C's debt must stand over till the next off season, when he can call on B either to pay up his debt or serve him for that off season.nexx. o i l w nen xie * **- •' &amp;■ tjrioi' to jpzxy his debt or serve liim fox- oir sv. asorx.

When Eamzan falls at the end of the pearling season, so that a second season does not commence after it, the sailors are free to go diving with whoever they like for the ' Eaddah ' or second diving season, which means that the diving proceeds are for the divers' profit and are shared by them. When the Eamzan falls in and during the pearling sea son, and divers have in consequence to work before and after Eamzan, then there is no ' Eaddah and if a sailor A embarks with a Nakhuda B for the season preceding Eamzan, he is bound to work with him also after Eamzan and to'finish the season (which is prac tically a double one) unless the contrary has been expressly stipulated between them.

C5 Rule 9. Engagement by Nakhudas of indebted sailors ; responsibility for their debts. See, also Rule 10. Nakhuda A wishes to or has engaged sailor B ; NaJchuda C already has a diving claim against B. A cannot engage B unless lie arranges with C to pay up B's debts either at once or by instalments, and C agrees. A. engages B without informing C. B is not provided with a ' harwah ' from C. A must surrender B, and B is bound to dive with C. A has failed to inform C, or to pay up C's claim; B in consequence has been drawing advances from A and C. (1) If B finally goes to A, A must pay up C's claim against B. (2) If B finally stays with C, C is not under obligation to repay A's advance to B, if it was made without his knowledge, and A must make his own arrange ment with B to get paid his claim, but without dis turbing C's diving arrangements. Bahrain Note :— ' B must have a ' barwah ' and that if B has no debt, he should have a ' barwah khalawi Bahrain Note :— ' (a) It must be proved that A was aware that B was previously indebted to C '. ' (6) After B has cleared his debt to C he must work for A and also clear that debt '. ' (c) C should not make fresh advances to B without A's knowledge Kuwait Note :— ' B takes two advances, one from Nakhuda A and one from Nakhuda C, and neither Nakhuda is aware of B's fraud. ' On discovery of the fraud either Nakhuda may retain B by paying up the other's claim on B. If however a ' barwah' has been issued which B did not produce, the Nakhuda who issued the ' barwah ' takes sailor B and pays up the other Nakhuda's claim on him . ' B takes several such advances from several Nakhudas A a fraudulently being already indebted to C ' On discovery C takes back B without paying any of the claims of Aa, who should have been more careful in engaging B. Aa can make their own arrangements with B, but without disturbing C's diving arrangements4 'J Rule 10. Engagement by Nakhudas of indebted sailors' responsibility for their debts. (See also Rule 9). Nakhuda A engages sailor B {not an inhabitant of A's town) and is told that B belongs to Nakhuda C but has not worked for C for the last 3 or 4 years, and it is not known if C has claims against B. B afterwards dies {either before or after working for A). Nakhuda A engages sailor B {not an inhabitant of A's town) thinking that no one has a claim against B; before B starts for the 'pearl fishery C, a former master, lodges a claim against B'. A can settle C's claim by mutual agreement to pay up by instalments the whole of B's debt. If C agrees to tHis, A retains the services of B ; otherwise C must pay up A's claim against B and remove B. B has already started with A to the fisheries, and C lodges a claim against B with land Nakhuda D {1) who fitted out A's boat. Bahrain and Shargah note :—■ ' A is responsible for C's claim and must settle it. C must prove it by his oath in support of his account book or by other means Kuwait note :— '' This rule only holds good when A has been pre viously informed of C's claim on B, and consi ders that if B dies before C informed A, then A is not responsible for C's claim Bahrain Note :— ' (1) In any of the above cases, the acceptance of ' tisqam ' by B from C entitles C to keep B, in which case A's claim must be settled on its merits, settlement being postponed till next season, when A and C will have to meet and try to settle the matter. ' (2) If the diver is a local man his previous Nakhuda C should have given him a ' barwah ' If the diver is from another town, Nakhuda A must make enquiries with a view to ascertaining whether the diver has any deb Is to any other nakhuda Shargah Note :— ' D must settle C's claim or write to A to surrender B, failing which B must be returned to C at the end of the season. In this case B's debts to C have preference over B's debts to A, until the former are paid but A may advance money in moderation to B Bahrain Note :— ' D is not responsible in such cases.' Kuwait Note :— ' D is not responsible in such cases, but D will tell A of C's claim at once, and at the end of the pearling season A will settle C's claim and keep B '.

Claims of Naklmdas against sailor. Counter claim of sailor against Nakhuda. (a) Claim denied before writing ' barwah.' (6) Claim denied after writing ' barwah Rule 12. Old outstanding claims of Nakhuda against sailors. Nakhuda A engages sailor B who 'previously worked for Nakhuda C. C claims his dues from A, hut B alleges a counterclaim against C. If B denies C's claim, C must prove it by his account books, supported by witnesses, or by oath before the Shara' or by the production of witnesses who were present when C settled with B. If his claim is so proved A must pay up C's claim. Usually the sailor B would not be believed. After first asking why the sailor was so foolish as to accept a false ' barwah the Salifah, if inclined to believe him, would call for the ' barwah ' held by C and if he finds the amount specified therein against the sailor is considerable, he will enquire how the claim came to be so large by having the Nakhuda's books produced and the account between C and B gone over carefully, as a sailor does not require a large sum for his living expenses. If C alleges he has paid previous claims of Nakhudas against B the ' Salifah ' should check this by C's account books, and his production of previous ' bar- wahs ' and then give a decision after it has been satisfactorily demonstrated. If the matter cannot be settled as above it mast go be fore the Shara' and be settled, after production of account books, on oath. Nakhuda A has sailors Bb indebted to him dispersed in different towns {debts may he as old as 20 years) and sailor may no longer be coming to him for advances nor bringing him letters from their chiefs asking him to give Bb advances. Bb embark with Nakhuda C and happen to meet A. C may arrange by mutual agreement to settle A's claim by instalments or if this is impracticable C will return Bb to A and A will pay up C's claims. 00 Note (J): —The above rules apply also to simple cases as between A and B. N'ote (2);—If a sailor B applies to Nakhuda A for an ad vance saying that he has been a sailor of C but is not in C's debt, A must not rely on B's statement but must accept whatever C says.

Bahrain Note on the whole of paragraph 13 : - It depends on the ' barwah ' the sailor B had : if C took B knowing that A had given a ' barwah ' in which it was arranged that certain instalments should be paid by B to A, then C must pay A even if B dies, because he took the responsibility of accepting the ' barwah If there was no barwah ', the case must be settled on its merits by the Salifah yRule 14. Claim of former Nakliuda against sailor , present Nakhuda unable to settle former Nakhuda's claim or to give advances to sailor. Rule 15. Claim of former Nakhuda against sailor who has embarked with another Nakhuda at another town ; non -acceptance of testimony of sailor. Rule 16. Effect of endorsement ' as to others we know nothing ' on a ' barwah . Rule 17. Rules regulating the amount of advance to be given by Nakhudas to sailors. Nakhuda A has a claim against sailor B who has since taken employment wi h Nakhudu C. C owing to lack of funds is unable to pay advances to B. C must obtain and advance money, with the assistance if necessary of his land Nakhuda, to B to enable him to settle A's claim either at once or by instalments. Instalments to be fixed according to circumstances, e.g., B's needs and the current price of pearls. If C fails to do so, the matter must be decided by the Salifah. Nakhuda A has a daim against sailor B who has sailed with Nakhuda C from some other town {not A's town. A lodges a claim against B with C in the latter s town. B's denial is not to be accepted. A must take an oath before the Shara' or produce his books before the Sulifah in support of his claim against B, who will be called on to settle with A. C must produce B and will probably advance funds to enable B to settle with A. Sailor previously indebted to Nakhuda A wot ks for C and receives a ' barwah ' endrsed thus. B then goes to Nakhuda D for who he works ten years or so. A then lodges an old claim against B. (1) D must pay A's claim on his proving it by oath or books, and keep B ; he being liable owing to the above note. (2) A must pay D's claims and take the man (Lin- gah only). Sailor B is indebted to Nakhuda A hut demands a larger advance than A will give. The matter is primarily one for settlement on its merits by the Salifah Court, the amount depending on cir cumstances, e.g., the amount of B s debt, the amount of B's share of the take (' gat'anah '), the capabili ties of the diver, and the status of the Nakhuda. Bahrain Note :— ' Very few Nakhudas would accept this sort of ' barwah ' and such a case would have to be carefully investigated before the Salifah and settled on its merits.'Rule 18. Intervention of Chiefs (Kuwait, Bahrain and Trucial Coast) to obtain advances from Na- khudas for sailors. Sailor B is indebted to Nakhuda A in the same town ; A refuses to advance money. Sailor B is indebted to Nakhuda A in another town ; he 'proceeds to A's town to ask for an advance hut is refused hy A. The Chief cannot compel A to advance money but A is bound either to advance B money or to give him a ' barwah If he refuses to do either then the ' Sailifah ' should decide the case. B's first step is to ask his Chief to give him a letter to A asking latter to grant B an advance, or to apply to the Salifah of A's town. Or B's Chief should ask someone to lend B money to live till A can pay, or he may give B a document ordering him to pay A's claim by suitable instalments , in the latter case B is free to leave A and work for others. Note,—If under the above circumstances B did not go to A to get an advance and did not bring a letter from his Chief (or the Salifah) to A, but embarked with V, then C is bound to pay A in full. Kuwait Note \— ' Nakhuda A is bound to advance money if other Nakhudas have done so. If A refuses, he will be forced to do so by the Salifah.' Lingeh Note:— ' The Chief should investigate the matter and if the Nakhuda cannot pay such an advance as is indi cated, having regard to all the circumstances, the Chiefs should arrange for B's debt to A to be liquidated by instalments, B being meanwhile set free.' \ ■ ;; ... . . .1^: J -J-.' ^ ■ im. vmmmrM ■-mini^■■■ ■ Mnnt* ■••■'''■* \W^ • kules hegulating duties and obligations of nakhud \s amn pi^pqamq wliv-v tt^xti-w jnakhudas andprrso^who lend them money for pearling business, becovery Kulo 19. Creditor and debtor in same town to A, a towash or merchant, advances money on diving business to Nakhuda H who goes to the Pearl Fishery ; at the end of the season B is unable to satisfy A's claim in full. (1) A can be merciful and advance more money to B to enable him to continue business, and meet his obligations to A by instalments. Or (2) B can, with the intervention if necessary of the Salifah, obtain an advance from C to enable him to settle with A. Or (3) Ling eh only. A is entitled to recover his claim from B's indebted divers and haulers, if B can not pay himself. Or (4) A is entitled to seize Nakhuda B's books and take over B's claims against his sailors, which are B's assets ; the said sailors thus becoming bound to A. A is also entitled to seize B's boat. If the above settle ment is only partial, A must wait till the following year and arrange for B to pay the rest by instalments, bhargah considers that A can recover his claim by action in the following order ;— {i) Vessel, (u) local indebted sailors, (Hi) foreign in debted sailors. iVo^.—A Nakhuda is generally speaking required to bring his take of pearls to the towash to whom he is in debted ; if they cannot agree on the price to be paid for them, he is then at liberty to sell them elsewhere for a better price, but on condition that he liquidates his debt to the towash from the proceeds. But this does not apply to a Nakhuda indebted to a trader, and advances of supplies {i.e., not cash) do not entitle the merchant to first refusal of the ' take.'§ Eule 20. Recovery of advances, creditor having moved to 0 another town of his own free will. Rule 21. Recovery of advances, creditor having been ex pelled by Chief. A advances money to NaJchuda B who goes to the pearl fishery. B is unable to pay his debt. A meanwhile goes to another town of his own free will. A must either advance more money to B to enable the latter to continue business or he may arrange with him to pay his claim by instalments. A cannot recover the whole claims at once by seizing B's boats, etc.; on the other hand B remains responsible for his debts and must pay A eventually with the in tervention if necessary of the Salifah. A advances money to NaJchuda B who goes to the pearl fishery and is unable to pay, A is meanwhile expelled by the Chief of the town. A mPjy, if he likes, make further advances to B or may recover his claim by instalments, but he cannot seize B's boats, etc. (Shargah apparently holds that he can). The claim remains valid and must be settled eventually. A's proper course is to appoint an Agent on his behalf to appear in the Salifah Court; he should also make a protest to the Chief of the Town in order to obtain a settlement of B's claims if possible before he (A) leaves the town. j - . i H-'umumf jWiHimi&gt;ti ... JBECJSt: _ .-.fRule 22. Form of Agreement of Nakhuda with his creditors. Right of Nakhuda to obtain money from a second creditor, first creditor being still un paid. A advances money on pearling business to Nakhuda B. B after two or three years obtains advances from C, his debts to A being unpaid. C is bound to pay A's claim against B. A advances money to Nakhuda B on pearling business, B having undertaken to bring his ' take ' to A. B re ceives advances from A for several years and is in A's debt. A then agrees with B to accept payment by in stalments. B then obtains money from C. (1) If it is recorded in the bond that ' anyone wishing to engage B is at liberty to do so on undertaking to pay his instalments,' then C is bound to pay A the instalments agreed upon in the bond. (2) If it is recorded in the bond that ' B will have to pay the instalment himself ' then C is not res ponsible, and A must take his own measures to , recover from B by distraint of boat crew, J or or by instalments, until A's claims are settled, pending which C is not entitled to lend B more money.fj 4 Rule 23. Responsibility of second creditor for loans made to Nakhuda by a previous creditor. A advances money to Nakhuda B on yearling business {B having undertaken to sell his 'take' to A.) B. delivers his 'take' to A, and after doing so, mites a bond for the balance of A's claim against him; he after wards goes to C, to whom he seUs his next 'take.' (a) If C has made an advance to B then A's claim is against C, who must pay up A's claim in full. (h) If C has not advanced money to B, then A's claim is on B. (c) If A informs C before the sale of B's second 'take' that he has a claim against B, then (if the sale takes place) A's claim is on C, whose action is illegal. {d) If the ''take' in question is sold to C before C could be told of A's claim, then A's claim is against B, and he can claim the sale of this second 'take.' (e) If C alleges that he was unaware of B's dealing with j A, the burden of proving the opposite lies with A, and C should take an oath that he was unaware of B's dealings with A. If he does so, he will not be ans werable and A's claim is against B. and A can proceed to distrain B's crew, boats, etaIHHHH HIHHUL. W: Vi Bule 24, Before the commeucement of tlie pearling season, a ' barwah ' for Ms total debts is given 07 sailor to Nakhuda. BAEWAH'S CUSTOM REGARDING— At the time of starting for the pearl banks, when the Nakhuda adjusts his accounts with the sailors he usually obtains a ' barwah ' from them duly at tested by witnesses, more particularly if there is any dispute about 'tisqam' (Shargah^- In Bahrain the 'barwah' is apparently only signed by the Nakhuda sometimes, but not necessarily before the Salifah Judge. In Kuwait it is not customary for Nakhudas to give barwahs to a sailor unless the latter wants to leave him, in which case he gets a 'barwah' which he then hawks round till he can induce some other Na khuda to pay its amount to the original Nakhuda. When this is done, the new Nakhuda retains the 'barwah' himself as documentary proof that he has legally engaged the sailor. In Kuwait (and probably elsewhere) a dispute between sailor and Nakhuda is generally decided by produc tion of the Nakhuda's books, in which the sailor's accounts are kept. Shargah states that advances giv en to sailors are recorded in the books and a 'barwah' for the total signed by them.J J PROCEDURE TO BE FOLLOWED WHEN AN INDEBTED SAILOR IS UNABLE TO WORK OWING TO ILLNESS. Rule 25. Sailor indebted to Nakhuda but unable to work owing to illness. Enquiry should be made, and if statement is true, B should be given time to recover; if A's boat is a large one, he should send B to work on some small boat, where the work is easier. (Shargah). Enquiry should be made, and if statement is true, B should be left behind to get over hia illness. (Kuwait).RECOVERY OF A NAKHUDA'S CLAIMS OUT OF ESTATE OF A DECEASED SAILOR. Kule 26. Estate of a deceased sailor can be distrained in satisfaction of the Nakhuda's debts. bailor B works for Nalchuda A for a 'period and becomes indebted to him. B then absconds from A, and later on dies, leaving effects and family, B's heirs must pay A if they can, and B's property may, if necessary, be distrained by A. The claim must be duly authenticated (vide Rule 11). Bahrain adds that the above is the 'ghaus' rule, but that such claims should be decided on their merits by the Shara' before the Qazi. G. M.

The first is guidelines for the manumission of slaves, printed by the British Government’s Foreign Office Press, and issued to the Political Resident at Bushire. Part one of the guidelines is for the Persian shore of the Persian Gulf. It outlines the authorities (treaties) for manumission, grounds for manumission, and the procedures for manumission. The second part of the guidelines deals with the Arabian shore of the Persian Gulf. Bahrain, Muscat and the Trucial Coast are dealt with separately.The second printed document in the file is a set of guidelines for dealing with the various scenarios in which economic disputes might arise between captains, divers and merchants in the pearling industry in the Gulf. The guidelines are for use by British agents and representatives in Bahrain, Kuwait, Bandar-e Lengeh and the Trucial Coast. The emphasis in the rules is on the honouring of debts as a means to ensuring the financial stability of the pearling industry, and sets out the obligations of divers to their captains, duties of captains to their divers, captains to other captains regarding loans, and captains to their debtors.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Political Agency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Native Agent, Trucial Coast, Sharjah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>James Orton</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Francis Warden</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Būshehr</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Abū-Shahr</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Hormuz Isle</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Pearl industry and trade</topic></subject><subject><topic>Indentured labour</topic></subject><subject><topic>Slave trade</topic></subject><subject><topic>Treaties</topic></subject><subject><topic>Slave emancipation</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0000cf#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
