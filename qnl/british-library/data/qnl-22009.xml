Transhipment of 832 bags of coffee belonging to Mohd. Omar Bazara.Copy of letter No. 1437 dated the 16th June, 1945 from the Governor of Bushire to Consulate General, Bushire. With reference to your letter No. 2449/13/1 dated the 11th June 1945 concerning the transit of 832 bags of coffee to the address of Mr. Mohd. Omar Bazarah, Basrah. I have the honour to Inform you that the Customs authorities at Bushire in reply to the enquiry made from them by this Governorate have reported that in accordance with the application sent by Haji Reza Hafteh, agent for the owner of the goods, to the Custom House here, and as a result of the action taken by the Customs authorities for obtaining permission from the Central Customs for transhipment of the goods, agreement was conveyed on the 20th December, 1944 on condition that a declaration for the transhipment of the goods should have been made within six months from the date of arrival of the goods# This matter was brought to the notice of Haji Reza Hafteh in letter No. 11420 dated the 18th Azar, 23 (9th December, 1944) by the Customs authorities at Bushire. As no reply was then given by Haji Reza Hafteh* they have again reminded him under their letter No. 900 dated 26.1.24 (17th April, 1945) Haji Reza Hafteh replied saying that in consequence of the W a r and for want of transport, submission of an application was delayed. For this reason the Customs House here wired again to Tehran in their telegram No. 961 and gave a favourable opinion on the subject and asked them for instruction on the matter. Haji Reza Hafteh who was called to this Governorate has confirmed these proceedings. I have, however, urged the Custom authorities here to expedite this, who have again sent a reminder to the Central authorities. I forward herewith a copy of the said two abovementioned telegrams for your information. Copy of telegram No. 54358 of 1323 (1944)from Custom, Bushire to Customs, Tehran. In continuation of telegram 961 of 29th Farvardin, 1324 ( (18th April, 1945) I request you to wire me your decision in connection with the 823 bags coffee belonging to Mr. Mohd. Omar Bazarah, subject of Aden, which Haji Reza Hafteh has asked for their transit to Basrah 3594 Signed Boulatshahi. Copy of telegram No. 54258 of 1323 (1944)from Custom, Bushire to Custom, Tehran. First. The coffee under reference arrived here in Abanraah of 1322 (November, 1943). Application for transit to foreign country given to this Custom House was on 8th Azarmah, 1323 (29th November, 1944) that is to say it was received ^fter the expiry of six months from the arrival of the goods. Second. In accordance with letter No. 653 from Haji Reza H a fteh*s firm it is said that in consequence of the W a r and non existence of means of transport delay took place in the submission of application. Third. He says that as the goods were for consumption in Iraq and were shipped from Aden, you may issue a permission for this transit as an exception. Fourth.

The request had been made as a result of discussions by merchants in Bahrain about an increase in Saudi Arabia’s coffee quota. Most of the remaining correspondence dates from 1945 and concerns the refusal of the Iranian Customs authorities to permit an Aden merchant to reship coffee consignments originally landed at Bushire, to Bahrain, Basra or back to Aden, to avoid financial loss. The file also includes a list of the names and addresses of Bahrain importers of Indian coffee and spices, compiled by the Bahrain Customs, in response to a request from an Indian exporter. The file ends with a letter from the Political Agent, Bahrain to the branch manager of the Imperial Bank of Iran, Bahrain, authorising the opening of foreign exchange credit facilities in favour of a Singapore exporter who had agreed the sale and shipment of a consignment of coffee to a Bahrain merchant.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Governor of Bushire</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Director of Customs, Bushire</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Bushire</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Coffee</topic></subject><subject><topic>Food control</topic></subject><subject><topic>Exports</topic></subject><subject><topic>Imports</topic></subject><subject><topic>Shipping</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0000cb#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
