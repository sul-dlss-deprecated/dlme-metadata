The shoulder and body are covered with roughly painted horizontal lines. The shoulder features a band of crosshatching and an irregular zigzag or rippling line. The body bears a wide pictorial zone with panels containing several vertical rows of plump, almost potbellied birds facing left framed by vertical sprigs of vegetation. Below this zone are five more horizontal lines. Judging from the interior of the vessel where the roughly worked inner surface joins the smoothly ribbed thrown section just below the shoulder, the long tapering body is hand built and only the shoulder, neck and base of the vessel are thrown. A corresponding change of profile is visible on the exterior as well.", "medium": "Clay, slip", "dimensions": "height: 12 3/4 in. (32.4 cm)\r\ndiameter: 6 9/16 in.
