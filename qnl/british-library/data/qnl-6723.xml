CONFIDENTIAL. June 4, 1928. Section 1. ' V E 2936/29/65] No. 1. MEMORANDUM. Relations between Persia and Iraq. RELATIONS between Persia and Iraq have never been normal far less friendly, but during the past year, in spite of the constant efforts of His Majesty s Government and the British Legation at Tehran, they have been getting steadily worse. Sir R. Clive, in a recent telegram, referred to them as the one black spot on the horizon. Sir H. Dobbs, the British High Commissioner at Bagdad, states Ins opinion that there is a real danger of serious complications arising along the 1 erso- Iraq frontier at any time; he even goes so far as to suggest that the time has come for His Majesty’s Government to consider the desirability of bringing all the cir cumstances now affecting the good understanding between Iraq and Persia to the notice of the League of Nations under paragraph 2 of article 11 ol the Deague Covenant, by which each member of the League has the right to bring to its attention any circumstance affecting international relations “which threatens to disturb international peace or the good understanding between nations upon which peace ^ 2. Although it has already been decided not to give effect to Sir H. Dobbs s proposal, the time has evidently come to review the various questions outstanding between the two countries, the^ recent events which have embittered the relations between them, and the possibility of reaching some general settlement between the two Governments which would place their relations upon a friendly basis. 3. At the outset it must be recognised that the real blame for the present state of affairs lies wholly, or almost wholly, with the Persian Government. There is not one of the questions outstanding between Iraq and Persia which could not at once be settled if the Persians were prepared to discuss such questions in a reason a b y friendly spirit. Hitherto Persia has shown no real desire to establish good relations with her western neighbour, and her present attitude, as Sir H. Dobbs points out, is one of official and calculated unfriendliness. , 4 The general causes, apart from the special grievances which will be described later, underlving Persia’s unsatisfactory attitude towards Iraq, and the mam factors which have durmg the past few years contributed to prevent an amicable settlement of their mutual differences, may be summarised as follows. (a ) The Persian disapproval of Arabs in general, and intense dislike of Iraqis in particular. This is joined to a contempt for a weak, and possibly insecure, Government so largely dependent on foreign (British) goodwill and assistance * (b ) Uncertainty as to Iraq’s future, and the Persian Government's general unwillingness to commit themselves in any way to friendly relations with what may be only a temporary regime. There is also a feeling that Persia has little to gain by establishing friendly relations. (c) Reliqious Difficulties. —The Persians are Shiah Mahomedans, whereas the members of the Iraqi Government are mostly Sunnis. _ The Persian (Shiah) Holy Cities are in Iraq, and the Persian clergy in those cities, who have great influence in Persia, are fundamentally reactionary and anti-foreign, and therefore none too well disposed towards the Iraqi Government. . 1 . T , . , . ., (d ) Complaints from members of the large Persian colony m Iraq, which is said to number 200,000. The Persian Government, Parliament and press are bombarded with petitions containing complaints, mostly exaggerated or untrue, but invariably believed at Tehran, of the ill-treatment and per secution of Persians by the Iraqi authorities. (e.) Frontier Incidents. —These are frequent and, indeed, inevitable, as the frontier districts are to a great extent peopled by tribes who are beyond ' 4470 [17768] BV v X 'J the control of their respective Governments. Many of the tribes are migratory and spend half the year in Iraq and half in Persia. Border raids, local disturbances, and even extensive risings, are by no means uncommon, especially on the Persian side of the frontier. The I ersians suspect that their rebellious tribesmen all along the frontier aie supphe with arms and assistance from British and Iraqi sources; they suspect also that the British authorities in Iraq are working for a policy o^ Kurdish autonomy under British protection. (/.) Finally, Russian influence at Tehran has a distinct bearing upon t e question. On the one hand, Russian propaganda does all it can to increase Persian ill-feeling against Iraq, and, on the other hand, t e Persian Government know that a settlement with Iraq would give ottence to the Russians, who would regard it as a success for British diplomacy. Recognition of Iraq. 5. Persia, although a member of the League of Nations, has never yet seen fit to £t recognise ” Iraq. The Iraqi Government take the line that the) can get on ^^r) well without Persian recognition, but they naturally resent the Persian attitude. At present all negotiations between the two Governments are carried on indiieetl) through the representatives of His Majesty s Government at Bagdad and I ehi an, often by way of London. Persia has, indeed, an acting consul-general at Bagdad, and other consular officers at Basra, Mosul, Khanikin and the Holy ( ities, but these have no official position vis-a-vis of the Iraq Government, and their presence gives rise to disputes on minor questions, such as that of their liability, not having received the exequatur of the Iraqi Government, to pay Iraqi taxation. In Persia the Biitish Leo-ation and consulates have to do what they can to exercise their good offices on behalf of Iraqis in that country; they find it an arduous and thankless task to secure the fair treatment of Iraqis, and their endeavours to this end are not only unwelcome to the Persian authorities, but are too often considered inadequate by the Iraqis concerned. . . , , i in 6. All the general influences summarised in paragraph 4 above have probably at some time or other had an important share in determining the Persian attitude with regard to recognition, but the factor which has evidently weighed most with the Persian Government of late is an idea, which naturally finds no favour m Bagdad, that recognition is an important bargaining counter which should not be o-iven away except in return for some substantial quid pro quo. At the end of 1924 all difficulties seemed in a fair way to being overcome; the Persian Government had assured King Feisal, through their acting consul-general at Bagdad, of their readiness to recognise Iraq, and arrangements were discussed for the despatch of official missions between Bagdad and Tehran as a preliminary to the negotiation of a treaty. The Persian Government’s final decision was, however, delayed, and, though again in July 1925 they seemed prepared to proceed with the settlement, the dvnastic crisis soon put an end to any endeavour on their part to put into practice the measure to which they had already in principle consented. In June 1926, at Sir P. Loraine’s final audience, the Shah repeated his promise that he had decided to recognise; no obstacle remained in the way; he would at once instruct his Prime Minister to discuss the procedure to be followed. But no action was taken. In November 1926 the Shah assured the new Minister, Sir R. Clive, that he had now definitely resolved to accord recognition; he would be prepared courteously to receive a mission of congratulation from Iraq, and would be prepared to discuss the outstanding matters between Iraq and Persia. He agreed that recognition must precede discussion, which should be postponed until a return mission from Persia reached Bagdad. He would at once instruct his Prime Minister to arrange the details. Again no action was taken to put into practice the Persian Government's assurances. 0 On the contrary, the Persian Minister of the Court has for the past fifteen months maintained that Persia would not be prepared to recognise Iraq unless Iraq were to extend to Persians the special judicial rights accorded to certain other foreign nationals in Iraq. His Majesty’s'Government first maintained that this matter could not be discussed until after recognition, but it soon became evident that no progress was likely to be made on these lines, and their endeavours have recently been directed to the possibility of securing a simultaneous settlement of the two questions (see paragraph 9 below). 7. The non-recognition of Iraq by the Persian Government is the primary obstacle to good relations between the two countries, and until this difficulty has been3 solved, no other problem connected with Persian-Iraq relations can be solved. It is a difficulty which cannot be overcome by Iraq, but which could be settled by Persia, were she animated by the slightest desire for friendly relations, at no cost to herself and by a mere stroke of the pen. But Persia is not willing to take the first step. At the same time it cannot be said that the Iraqi Government has been passive or ^mhelpful in the matter. King Feisal on two occasions, having been solemnly assured that if he would write a friendly letter to the Shah a courteous and immediate reply would be returned and a favourable atmosphere for recognition thereby created, has written to the Shah in friendly terms; but on neither occasion has he been vouchsafed a reply. 8. It has in the past been suggested that, in order to make the Persian Govern ment realise that their unfriendly attitude towards Iraq does not pay, they should be informed that their consuls in Iraq should no longer be permitted to exercise any functions until recognition has taken place. Alternatively, the Persian Government might be requested to apply for exequaturs for their consuls in Iraq; if they did so this would constitute formal de jure recognition; if they did not their consuls should not be allowed to exercise any authority whatever. These methods of coercion have hitherto been rejected by His Majesty’s Government on the grounds that (a) they would only embitter Anglo-Persian relations; (b) that such reprisals on the part of Iraq would be more likely to lead to counter-reprisals on the part of Persia than to recosrnition. o Judicial Privileges in Iraq. 9. The Persian Government have made their recognition of Iraq dependent upon the extension to their nationals in Iraq of the judicial privileges enjoyed by certain other foreigners under the Judicial Agreement of 1924. The relevant treaty provisions are article 9 of the Anglo-Iraq Treaty of the 10th October, 1922, which runs as follows :— “ His Majesty the King of Iraq undertakes that he will accept and give effect to such reasonable provisions as His Britannic Majesty may consider necessary in judicial matters to safeguard the interests of foreigners in consequence of the non-application of the immunities and privileges enjoyed by them under Capitulation or usage. These provisions shall be embodied in a separate agreement, which shall be communicated to the Council of the League of Nations.” And article 1 of the Judicial Agreement of the 25th March, 1924, which runs as follows :— “ The expression ‘ foreigners ’ means the nationals of any European or American State which formerly benefited by Capitulations in Turkey and did not renounce the same by an agreement signed before the 24th July, 1923, and of any Asiatic State which is now permanently represented on the Council of the League of Nations . . . .” It will be seen that not only Persian nationals, but also Czechoslovak, German, Polish, Swiss, Turkish and other foreign nationals in Iraq are excluded from the benefits of the Judicial Agreement. 10. The Persians maintain that they have a legal and moral right to judicial privileges in Iraq, firstly because they enjoyed a special judicial regime in Iraq under Turkish rule, and, secondly, because all members of the League of Nations should, in such a matter, receive equal treatment. They say that if no legal privileges for foreigners existed in Iraq, and if all foreigners were subject to native courts and native laws, Persia would not dream of demanding special privileges; but that, so long as a special legal regime exists in Iraq, there is no reason why it should be denied to Persian subjects. It must be admitted that there is some logical basis for their claim. 11. The Iraqis, on the other hand, are by no means enamoured of the Judicial Agreement, and to obtain their consent to its extension to the Persian colony is quite out of the question. Even from the practical point of view it would clearly be impossible, without disorganising the whole legal system of the country, to extend to the 200,000 Persian residents the privileges which have hitherto been enjoyed only by certain small groups of foreigners. Moreover, the Iraqis find it difficult to understand why Persia should be demanding privileges of a capitulatory nature in [17768] b 24 Iraq at the very time when she is abolishing such privileges in her own country, thus claiming rights which she is not prepared to give in return. It is not as n the Persian legal system were comparable to a modern European system; on the contiary, the Persian courts are notoriously corrupt and inefficient, and aie probably a good deal worse than the Iraqi courts to which the Persian Government take exception, especially as in Persia, unlike Iraq, there are no European judges or judicial advisers. The Persian claims are considered at Bagdad to be unjustified and quite inadmissible^^ 12. It is evident that on both sides the question is largely one of amour-propre, and His Majesty’s Government consider that, with goodwill on both sides, some face-saving compromise could very easily be reached. The Persians have, m fact, receded at last from the position that they must be granted the full benefits of the Judicial Agreement. Their latest proposals (March 1928) are {a) that civil and criminal cases in which Persians are concerned should be examined, in the Hrst instance, in local com ts composed of members of the Shiah sect; (b) that appeals from such cases should be heard in the special courts existing [or foreign nationals under the Judicial Agreement. 13. Sir H. Dobbs has conclusively shown that the former proposal is quite impracticable. It would necessitate the creation of a special corps of Shiah magistrates and judges, who would have to be rushed about from place to place whenever a Persian subject found himself before the courts or involved in a police investigation in which the magistrate was not a Shiah. It would be a distinct set-back to the Iraqi judicial system to have to introduce a religious test as the necessary qualification for judicial appointments; and to have to fill vacant posts with Shiahs, even if the only suitable candidates from the point of view of their legal attainments did not happen to belong to that sect. 14. The question remains whether the Second proposal regarding appeals can be accepted. Sir H. Dobbs states that though it would probably give rise to little difficulty in practice, it may prove impossible to prevail upon the Iraqi Government to accept it, and he does not think that His Majesty’s Government would be justified in requiring them to do so, especially as the result might be to raise, in an acute form, the question of the nationals of the other States mentioned at the end of paragraph 9. Sir R. Clive has, however, suggested that, in view of the undoubted importance, on general political grounds, of bringing about a settlement of Perso-Iraq relations, it would be well to make an effort to get the Iraqi Government to agree. It might be made acceptable to the Iraqi Government if it were suggested to them that the Persians should, in return, extend to Iraqi nationals in Persia the judicial safeguards which they have granted to British nationals in Persia. There would then be no question of admitting the inferiority of their courts. In return for a concession which would, in fact, cost them nothing, they would obtain safeguards in Persia and, incidentally, Persian recognition. It is, of course, by no means certain that either Iraq or Persia would agree to a settlement on these lines, but it is the last hope of avoiding a complete deadlock. Iraqi Nationality Law. 15. Another Persian grievance is the refusal of the Iraqi Government to extend the period daring which Persian residents in Iraq might renounce Iraqi nationality under paragraph 14 of the Iraqi Nationality Law of October 192-4. It is unnecessary to examine this question in any detail. Briefly, declarations renounc ing Iraqi nationality could be made at any time after the promulgation of the law until August 1926. This period was twice extended, but it came to an end on the 1st January, 1928. The Persians contend that their nationals in outlying districts of Iraq have had no time to grasp the full implications of the law, but as they had from October 1924 until January 1928 to ascertain the situation and make up their minds what to do, this contention is clearly untenable. The Iraqi Government stated, and with some reason, that a further extension of the period for renouncing Iraqi nationality would only have resulted in an intensive campaign by Persian consuls to persuade Iraqis of Persian descent to renounce their nationality. The Persians, however, feel that many thousands of individuals whom they consider to be Persians have been unjustly forced to become Iraqis, and last December the Persian Government even went so far as to say that non-compliance with their request for a further extension would have a prejudicial effect on the negotiations which had just been begun with Sir R. Clive for a comprehensive settlement of Anglo- Persian questions.5 f Iraq-Persian Frontier:* (a.) Validity of 1913-14 Settlement. 16. The Turco-Persian frontier, of which the present iraq-Persian frontier is now a part, was roughly settled by the Treaty of Erzerum in 1847. In Is frontier incidents were clearly leading to war, and the Russian and British Govern ments were asked to mediate between the rival claims. Amongst the preceding incidents had been (a) an act of aggression on the part of Persia in 1833 b) 1 ersl f' n troops, who had occupied the district of Zohab (near Kasr-i-Shirin); (b) an attack v Turkish troops in 1837 on the important and thriving town of Mohammeralq was razed to the ground in order that it should not become a rival to the lurkisn town of Basra; and (c) the capture of Suleimanieh in 1840 by Persian troops. A Turco-Persian conference was accordingly convoked at Erzerum in 1843, and was attended by delegates of the four Powers. Discussions lasted lor four years, and eventually His Majesty’s Government and the Russian Government were compelled to enter into direct discussions on the questions involved. Under their mediation the Treaty of Erzerum was at length signed on the 31st May, 1847. 17. Article 2 of the Treaty of Erzerum dealt with the disputed areas, it awarded Suleimanieh to Turkey and Mohammerah to Persia, giving Persian ships the right to navigate the Shatt-el-Arab; the Province of Zohab was divided between Persia and Turkey. Article 3 of the treaty recorded that all other territorial claims were abandoned, and provided that a commission should be appointed to demarcate the frontier. A commission composed of representatives of the four Powers was subsequently appointed to demarcate the frontier, but completely tailed to reach a settlement. The Turkish commissioner agreed, according to the letter of the treaty, to deliver up the town of Mohammerah and the island of Abadan, but not an inch of the surrounding territory; and all along the frontier difficulties, wffiich were apparently insuperable, w T ere raised by either side. . . 18. The frontier remained unsettled for more than sixty years m spite of the appointment of numerous commissions and the fruitless efforts of the mediating Powers. In 1905 an unusually serious incident occurred wffien Turkish tro&lt; ffi? s advanced in the neighbourhood of Urumia w T ell beyond the frontier zone, and this seems to have made the Persians anxious to reach a settlement. Sir Edward subsequently entered into negotiations wuth the Turkish Government regai ding the delimitation of the southern part of the frontier, and he succeeded in persuading the Turks to renounce their wffiolly impracticable and long unrecognised claims to the lands round Mohammerah. An agreement was signed by Sir Edward Grey and Hakki Pasha on the 29th July, 1913. in the form of an Anglo-Turkish declaration, and this declaration was subsequently ratified by the Turkish Legislature. At the same time negotiations w-ere carried on at Constantinople in regard to the rest of the frontier, and the Anglo-Turkish declaration was embodied in a protocol signed on behalf of the four Powers on the 17th November, 1913. 19. The protocol of the 17th November, 1913, defined in great detail the lurco- Persian frontier and appointed a commission composed of British, Russian, Turkish and Persian representatives to delimit it. The decisions of the Delimitation Commission were to be final and would not be susceptible of further examination or of revision. In the case of a difference of opinion on the commission^ the Turkish and Persian delegates were to explain their respective points of view to their Russian and British colleagues, who would decide the question in dispute, and their decision would be inserted in the minutes and would be recognised as obligatory by all four Governments. 20. The Delimitation Commission began its work in 1914, and had accom plished it before November, when Turkey entered into the war. The 1913-14 frontier settlement was, therefore, complete and was considered binding on the Governments concerned. 21. There is one aspect of the 1913-14 boundary settlement which calls tor special mention. In 1852 the mediating commissioners, after careful investigations on the spot, proposed a frontier line for the Zohab region, which had the twofold advantage of being based on article 2 of the Treaty of Erzerum and of offering a just compromise between the Persian and Turkish claims. The proposal was, however, rejected by Turkey at the time, with the result that some of the territory in dispute remained in the de facto possession of Persia. The mediating Powers in 1913 proceeded upon the principle that the line thus proposed in 1852 should be adopted, and this was agreed to by Turkey and Persia, subject to a slight readjust ment agreed to for reasons of political convenience, which involved the reciprocal See map. B 3 [17768]6 cession of areas, approximately equal in extent, by both Turkey and Persia. Turkey finally abandoned to Persia the town and adjacent territory of Kasr-i-Shirin and received in return an accession of territory further north. This is the origin of the so-called “transferred territories,” which have become of considerable importance in view of the oil-bearing areas discovered therein by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. - . Ct 22. After the war, in view of the collapse of both Russia and Turkey, it wat^ not unnatural that Persia’s claims to territorial aggrandisement should be revived. The Persian delegation to the Peace Conference put forward enormous and quite unjustifiable claims. Lord Curzon was, however, not opposed in principle to some rectification of the Persian western frontier, and he informed the Persian Foreign Minister in January 1920 that if, after studying the geographical and ethnological details of the case, His Majesty’s Government were able to support the Persians in some reasonable claims in this direction they would be very glad to do so. A specific reference to the question was, in fact, made in article 62 of the Treaty of Sevres (August 1920), whereby a commission sitting at Constantinople was to draft a scheme of local autonomy for the predominantly Kurdish areas lying east of the Euphrates. The scheme would— “ contain full safeguards for the protection of the Assyro-Chaldeans and other racial or religious minorities within these areas, and with this object a commission composed of British, French, Italian, Persian and Kurdish representatives shall visit the spot to examine and decide what rectification, if any, should be made in the Turkish frontier, where, under the provisions of the present treaty, that frontier coincides with that of Persia.” This provision of the Treaty of Sevres was never put into force. 23. Comparatively recent developments, such as the discovery of oil in the transferred territories, and the possibility that Mohammerah will be chosen as the southern terminus of the new Persian railway, have caused the Persian Government to question the validity of the 1913-14 frontier settlement on the ground that it has never been ratified by the Persian Parliament. Article 22 of the Persian Constitutional Law of 1906 provides that—- “ whenever a part of the revenue or property of the Government or State is to be sold, or a change of frontier or border becomes necessary, it will be done with the approval of the National Assembly.” The 1913 protocol has, however, never received the approval of the Persian National Assembly. 24. The most recent views expressed by the Foreign Office on this question are contained in a letter to the Colonial Office dated the 25th May, 1927. There can be no question as to the validity of the 1913-14 settlement for the following reasons :— (i.) That settlement merely defined in greater detail the provisions of the Treaty of Erzerum, which was signed sixty years before the Persian Constitution, and therefore did not require ratification by the Majlis. (ii.) Article 5 of the 1913 protocol shows clearly that ratification was never intended or required (the article in question runs as follows :— “ Des qu’une partie de la frontiere aura ete delimitee, cette partie sera consideree comme fixee definitivement et ne sera susceptible ni d’examen ulterieur ni de revision.”) (iii.) The settlement has been tacitly accepted by the Persian Government and even by the Majlis itself for more than twelve years. His Majesty’s Government would, therefore, be justified in refusing to discuss the matter if the Persian Government raised it officially. 25. The Persian Government have not yet officially challenged the validity of the 1913 frontier settlement. It is, however, possible that the Turco-Persian frontier negotiations now proceeding at Angora may result in a joint declaration by Turkey, Persia and Russia, which would leave His Majesty’s Government the only one of the four contracting parties to maintain its validity. Meanwhile, the Persians have made no secret of their views. Thus on the 2nd January, 1928, Sir R. Clive reported that he had been asked unofficially to ascertain whether the Iraqi Govern ment would be willing to discontinue the construction of a frontier guard at Baghshah7 in the transferred territories, pending the settlement of the frontier negotiations between Persia and Turkey, since the Turkish Government had stated that they did not recognise the 1913 Protocol. Sir R. Clive replied that His Majesty’s Government considered the frontier settled and not open to discussion. Again, on the 19th April, 1928, the Minister of the Court wrote to Sir R. Clive a letter in which the following massage occurs :— “nous sommes prives du droit d’avoir nos eaux territoriales a Chatt-el-Arab et ceci en vertu d’un protocole [de 1913] qui reste encore sans effet et conteste et qui donne, malheureusement pour nous, une precision desolante a la vaguesse du Traite d’Erzeroum.”* Iraq Persian Frontier: (b) The Shatt-el-Arab. 26. The 1913 settlement defined the frontier on the Shatt-el-Arab as the low- water-mark on the Persian bank, except in the neighbourhood of Mohammerah, where the medium filum aquas was chosen. This merely recapitulated the relevant provisions of article 2 of the Treaty of Erzerum (see paragraph 17 above), which run as follows :— “ Le Gouvernement ottoman s’engage formellement a ce que la ville et Techelle de Mohammara, Tile de tKhizr, le lieu d'ancrage, et aussi les terrains de la rive orientale, c’est-a-dire, de la rive gauche du Schatt-ul-Arab, qui sont en la possession des tribus reconnues comme relevant de la Perse, soient dans la possession du Gouvernement persan en pleine souverainete. “ Outre cela, les navires persans auront le droit de naviguer en pleine liberte sur le Schatt-ul-Arab, depuis 1’endroit oil ce fleuve se jette dans la mer jusqu’au point de contact des frontieres des deux parties.” Thus the Treaty of Erzerum evidently contemplated that Persia should own the lands to the east of the Shatt-el-Arab, but that Turkey should own all the river, although Persia was given navigation rights on a certain part of it. 27. The Persians feel that the present frontier is unfair and that it should, “according to universal custom,” be in mid-stream. The Minister of the Court informed Sir R. Clive on the 1st April that this is one of the questions which the Persian Government wish to raise with His Majesty’s Government in the course of negotiations for a comprehensive settlement. Sir R. Clive replied that this was a question to be raised with the Iraq Government after recognition. 28. Sir R. Clive has been instructed to give the Persian Government no reason to believe that they have anything to gain by pursuing the matter further. Although they may have a case for the revision of the present system of port dues, it is not clear that, even from their point of view, there is any real need for the present frontier to be altered. But if there is, they must realise that they will have to win the consent of the Iraqi Government and people, and must be prepared to offer concessions at least of equal value. In any case there is nothing to be done until they have taken steps to recognise the Iraqi Government and to establish relations with them on a friendly basis. The alteration of the Iraqi frontier in Persia’s favour is a matter which His Majesty’s Government, in fairness to Iraq, are not prepared to discuss. 29. Apart from the frontier question the Persians appear to have a genuine grievance in the matter of port dues and control on the Shatt-el-Arab. The Basra Port Authority was set up after the war, on the ground that the trade and commerce of Iraq must bear a proportion of the burden of the cost of the port of Basra, and port dues have since been levied on all vessels entering the river. The result is that the port of Basra now derives more than one-third of its revenues from shipping visiting what is practically the Persian port of Abadan and the undoubtedly Persian port of Mohammerah. The Persian Government resent the imposition of dues of this nature upon Persian shipping by a foreign body, upon which they are not in any way represented. This somewhat natural resentment accounts for their insistence in April on the immediate withdrawal from Abadan of the local branch office of the Basra Port Authority, which had been established on Persian soil without their permission. At the same time, some such body, which supervises lighting and buoying, the dredging of the bar and the safe navigation of the river, is clearly necessary in the interests of all shipping, whether proceeding to Persian * The statement that it was the H'13 protocol that deprived Persia of the right under the Treaty of Erzerum to a more favourable frontier on the Shatt-el-Arab is quite unfounded (see paragraph 26). t The modern island of Abadan.or Iraqi ports, and it is right that shipping proceeding to Persian ports should contribute towards its expenses. Some arrangement will undoubtedly have to be made, as soon as Persia has recognised Iraq, for Persian participation in the control of the waterway. Recent Events. r 30. The most important events of the past year may be summarised as follows :— August 1U27. The Persian Government closed the Perso-Iraq frontier, the excuse being an outbreak of cholera at Basra. The Minister of the Court admitted to Sir R. Clive that the real reason was their great dissatisfaction at the treatment accorded to Persians in Iraq. Persian pilgrims brought nearly £1 million per annum into Iraq, and it was intended to stop this traffic until the Iraqi Government showed a friendly disposition. The Persian authorities proceeded to establish a quarantine station at Kasr-i- Shirin. in which travellers were detained for five days under disgraceful sanitary conditions. The quarantine appears to have been unnecessary, and only to have been imposed as retaliation for the treatment of Persians in Iraq. September 1927. The Persian Government submitted a Bill to the Majlis for a credit of £2,000 for assistance to Persians in Iraq; the Majlis added a clause prohibiting the grant of passports to any Persian subject wishing to go to Iraq “ until Persian residents in Iraq shall be contented with their conditions of life.” The Minister of the Court attributed this action to the strength of the feeling in Persia against the Iraqi Nationality Law. December 1927. Appointment of Nasr-ul-Mulk, the Prime Minister's nephew, as acting Persian consul-general at Bagdad. The Persian Government declared that non-compliance with their request for an extension of the period for declarations under the Iraqi Nationality Law would have a prejudicial effect on their negotiations with His Majesty’s Government. January 1928. The Persian Government requested unofficially that the Iraqi Government should discontinue the construction of a frontier post in the transferred territories, thus raising the question of the validity of the 1913 frontier settlement. The Persian Minister of the Court informed Sir R. Clive of his wish to raise frontier questions with Iraq. Owing to unwise prosecutions under the census laws by Iraqi local authorities, many Persian residents in Iraq fled to Persia. This led to much ill-feeling in Persia, and the Majlis authorised a grant of £4,000 for the refugees. The Persian Government lodged a series of complaints with Sir R. Clive, in which they again stated that this ill-treatment of their residents in Iraq would prejudice the successful outcome of their negotiations with His Majesty’s Government. April 1928. The Minister of the Court informed Sir R. Clive of the Persian Government’s wish to discuss the frontier on the Shatt-el-Arab as one of the items in a comprehensive settlement with His Majesty's Government. Incidents at Abadan, including the ejection of the local branch of the Basra Port Authority at twenty-four hours’ notice. The Minister of the Court informed the resident-director of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company that the Persian action was directed against Iraq. The Persians intended to bring all possible pressure to bear on Iraq with a view to the recovery of Persian rights on the Shatt-el-Arab.9 May 1928. The Majlis passed a law on the 3rd May providing for the application of the Persian maximum tariff to countries which had not concluded customs agreements with Persia before the 10th May. At Sir R. Clive's request, however, the Persian Government have consented to give Iraq the benefit of their minimum tariff until the end of the present year in the hope that a satisfactory settlement with Iraq will be reached before that date, and this agreement has been recorded in an exchange of notes. Policy of His Majesty's Government. 31. Although His Majesty’s Government, in view of their special relations with Iraq, are directly interested in the establishment of normal friendly relations between Iraq and her neighbours, their position in the present negotiations with Persia regarding Iraq is little more than that of a mediator. Before they can make Persia the smallest offer towards the satisfaction of her demands they must obtain the consent of the Iraqi Government to the proposed concession; and this is in itself a most formidable task. The Persian Government completely fail to understand this. They imagine that the Iraqi Government do exactly what the British High Commissioner at Bagdad tells them to do, and that the difficulties in the way of obtaining judicial privileges are entirely due to British obstruction. They absolutely refuse to believe that the point of view of the Iraqi Government need be taken seriously into account. The endeavours of His Majesty’s Government are at present being directed to securing a simultaneous settlement of the questions of recognition and of judicial privileges (see paragraphs 10 to 14), and they have hitherto refused to be drawn into a discussion of frontier questions. The success of their whole policy depends upon the possibility of inducing the Iraqi Government and the Persian Government to agree to a compromise in the matter of judicial privileges. It may, however, prove impossible to persuade the Iraqi Government to agree to any concession whatever in this matter, and there can be no certainty that, even if the Iraqi Government could be induced to agree to the settlement which Sir H. Dobbs has now been instructed to propose to them, the consent of the Persian Government will be obtained. It may therefore be well to examine briefly the possible lines of policy which would be open to His Majesty’s Government if it proves impossible to reach agreement on the question of judicial privileges. In the first place, His Majesty’s Government could simply allow matters to drift, in the hope that Persia wilfin time come to see that there is nothing to be gained by withholding her recognition, and that there are advantages in entering upon direct negotiations with Iraq upon the questions at issue. I he situation might conceivably be improved by the admission of Iraq to the League of Nations, which may possibly take place in 1932. There is, however, a distinct danger that matters would only drift from bad to worse, and that some unforeseen incident would bring matters to a head and seriously endanger the maintenance of good relations between Persia and Great Britain. Secondly, His Majesty’s Government could endeavour by more positive measures to make the Persians realise that their present attitude does not pay. They could, for example, permit the Iraqis to insist on their strict legal rights in minor matters, such as a refusal to allow the usual privileges (e.g., exemption from customs dues or taxation) to Persian representatives in Iraq, or a refusal to allow Persian warships to anchor in the Shatt-el-Arab. Again, it would be possible to inform the Persian Government that their consuls in Iraq will no longer be allowed to exercise authority unless exequaturs are applied for from the Iraqi Government (see paragraph 8 above). Again, the Persian Government could be informed that, as Persia is not one of the-members of the League of Nations who have accepted the present situation, His Majesty’s Government consider themselves to be under no obligation towards Persia to ensure the fulfilment by Iraq of any of the provisions of the Anglo-Iraq Treaty of 1922, in so far as they affect Persia and Persian nationals; His Majesty’s Government would thus no longer prevent the Iraqi Goverment from discriminating against Persian nationals. The disadvantage of initiating, or permitting Iraq to initiate, a policy of reprisals is that any such policy would undoubtedly embitter Anglo-Persian relations, and that its chances of bringing about an improvement in Iraq-Persian relations are. exceedingly remote. On the contrary, reprisals w T ould be far more likely to lead to10 counter-reprisals than to recognition, and although Iraq could in many ways make things unpleasant for Persia, Persia can, unfortunately, if she so chooses, make things still more unpleasant for Iraq. Thirdly, it would be possible for His Majesty’s Government to bring the fact that Persia has not yet recognised Iraq to the knowledge of the League of Nations. It would be desirable in that event to avoid a reference to the League under article 1%^ of the League Covenant, as it would be difficult to complain that Persia’s attitude threatens to disturb international peace without being able to quote a single instance ^ in which Persia has exceeded her strict legal rights or acted in a warlike manner. Still, it might be possible to find some less objectionable method of bringing the situation to the notice of the League. It is, however, doubtful if an examination of the question by the League would be likely to lead to a final settlement, or, indeed, to anything more than a public statement by the Persians justifying their claims to judicial privileges in Iraq, a statement which would cause much resentment in Iraq, and render a solution of the present problems even more remote. It is, in any case, desirable to avoid embarking upon an anti-Persian campaign at Geneva. Fourthly, it might be considered whether, if it proves impossible to offer Persia any satisfaction in the matter of judicial privileges, she could be offered instead some satisfaction on the Shatt-el-Arab, such as representation on the Basra Port Trust, in return for recognition. It is doubtful, however, whether the Iraqi Government could be persuaded to agree in advance to any concession on these lines, and it is ’ even more doubtful if Persia could be induced to accept such a solution, which would involve the complete abandonment of her present position. The present situation is clear. The efforts of His Majesty’s Government must be devoted to an attempt to secure the consent, firstly, of the Iraqi Government, and, secondly, of the Persian Government to the proposed solution of the difficult question of judicial privileges. If those efforts fail, the position must be reconsidered on the lines suggested above, although it is difficult to believe that any course of action which has hitherto been suggested would be likely to solve the resulting deadlock.
