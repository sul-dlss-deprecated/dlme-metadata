He has not had any conversations with the Government of India on this subject and has nofintention of raising it. If they do, he will stall by producing his legal objections and saying that he will have to take advice in the matter. 4. We have here, of course, very little background to this matter, but if you still think it necessary to warn India (gp. undec) of the Sultan’s objections and the opinion of the Foreign Office on them I should be grateful if you would take parallel action to inform me.

Article 23. This Treaty was mostly negotiated in London while the Sultan was there in 1238 and I asked him whether he wished the new Treaty to be negotiated during his proposed visit to the United Kingdom in 1250. I told him that I was making this enquiry without Instructions and that I did not know what the views of the Foreign iffice would be. He replied that provided we could let him have His Majesty's Government's proposals in good time before his depart ure for the United kingdom he would be glad to discuss the new Treaty there. A 2. I next enquired whether he wished to negotiate separate treaties with India and Pakistan# He replied that provided these two countries remained within the Commonwealth he thought it would be sufficient to negotiate a treaty with His Majesty's Government leaving it to other members of the Commonwealth to accede or not as they wished, c.f. Article 20 of the present treaty. I i»ir&gt;d that I did not know the views of the oreign cffice but ^hat I was inclined to think that it might be found desirable for him to negotiate separate treaties direct with India arid Pakistan. Possibly when the two Govern ments receive notice of the Sultan's intention not to re new the present treaty they will themselves indicate whether they wish to negotiate new treaties with the bultan direct or whether it will meet their requirements if their interests are covered by His majesty's Govern ment's new treaty with him. Personally 1 ari in favour of encouraging them to negotiate separate treaties as the Sultan has made up his mind not to allow Indians and Pakistanis the continued enjoyment of their present privi leges in respect of jurisdiction and I should like to leave the Governments concerned to fight their battle with him over this question and avoid the possibility of His Majesty's Government being saddled with responsibility for the loss of these privileges. 3. 1 should be grateful if you could let me know whether the suggestion that the new treaty should be negotiated with the Sultan in London during his proposed visit in 1950 is approved. ••• B.A.B.

Pakistan automatically succeeds to the Muscat Treaty. 3 . we have pointed out to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (see my letter to Akhtar Husain, enclosed herewith) that we still think their view is incorrect but we should be grateful for your instructions as to what should be done next. If the Sultan of Muscat is agreeable to accepting the Pakistan argument, it would, of course, be the easiest way out of a rather awkward position, but we imagine that he is not likely to do so.

PRC/EEW/5SECRET NO.D.79C-AA/49 Government of Pakistan, Ministry of Foreign Affairs &amp; Commonwealth Relations, KARACHI. 5th April, 1949. By Dear Burnett, Will you kindly refer to Sir Laurence Grafftey Smith's demi-official letter No.283 dated the 2Cth December 1948 to Ikramullah on the subject of Pakistan's accession to the fcuscot Treaty of 1939? 2. We have examined this question again and are advised that according to the principles of International Law applicable to such cases Pakistan must be regarded as having succeeded to the rights and obligations under the Muscat Treaty of 1939 by subrogation. Under the circumstances no revision of our previously held view would appear to be called for. No action, therefore, need be taken by His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom in regard to•Pakistan's accession to the Muscat Treaty of 1-39 as Pakistan continues to be a party to that treaty by virtue of Article 4 of the Schedule to the Indian Independence (International Arrangements) Order 1947. If necessary this may be explained to His Highness the Sultan of Muscat. 3 You may be interested to know that there are many Inter national Conventions and Treaties of which Pakistan continues to be a party in accordance with the provisions of Article 4 of the Schedule to the Indian Independence (International Arrangements) Order 1947, some of which are:- (i) The International Convention on Narcotic Drugs. (ii) The International Convention on Statistics. (iii) The International Load Line Convention. (iv) The International Sanitary Conventions of 1932 &amp; 1938 (v) The Peace Treaties with Italy, Roumania, Bulgaria, Finland and Hungary. Yours sincerely, Signed: AKHTAR HUSAIN :.R. Burnett, Esq., ^ . •eputy High Commissioner for the U.K. in Pakistan,SECRET 28th April, 1949. No.283 My dear Akhtar Husain, I should have v/ritten before now to thank you for your letter N0.D.79G-AA/49 of April 5th, which has been copied to London* 2. V/e are interested to see that your legal advisers hold a different view from that of the U *K* Government regarding the effect upon Pakistan's succession to Inter national Treaties of Article 4 of the Schedule to the Indian Independence (International Arrangements) Crder, 1947. As we understand it here, the U *K. Government con* sider that Article to be binding only upon Indian and Pakistan and not necessarily upon the other parties to treaties with undivided India, and therefore that these other parties have discretion to accept or not to accept the Article as it affects themselves. S. Holding this view, the U.K. Government are, I fear, unlikely to feel able to explain to His Highness the Sultan of Muscat, as you suggest, that the conflicting view held by your legal advisers is the correct one. 4. , Since the Sultan himself is known to hold the view that Pakistan is not a party to the Treaty of 1939 and must accede under Article 20, and since the U.K. Govern ment consider that, if Pakistan claims to be a party by succession, it will rest with the Sultan to decide whether to admit that claim, we think it all too probable that the Pakistan claim to be a party to the Treaty will be rejected. 5. These, however, are our Office views only, and your Government may wish to await reactions from London and the Gulf before considering whether they might be well advised to accept this position and to apply for accession under Article 20 of the Treaty. Yours sincerely, SGE. R.R. BURNETT. LBGS/EES/6— —~— SECRET. PERSIAN GULF RESIDENCY, BAHRAIN, 19th January, 1949. (g) IU- , X Vi r lll you please refer to your secret letter No. 1/8/65/49 of the 4th January about the 1939 Treaty? ^ reply was received some time ago to my u.C oi April 19th, and I now enclose a copy. Orders were passed at the time for this to be copieu to you, but by an unfortunate oversight, perhaps because it was ^ust at the period of transition in our filing system, this was not acted upon. However, as you will see from paragraph 4, the Foreign Office recommends that we should delay replying to the Sultan at the moment. ^ I also enclose copies of Government of Pakistan’s aespatch No. Ssia/52/47 of the 18th October, 1948, and the United Kingdom High Commissioner in Pakistan s despatch No. 283 of the 20th December, 1948. 4 In view of what is stated in paragraph 5 oi Burrows letter of the 6th August, 1948, the matter under discussion appears to be of purely academic interest. Almost the only privilege Pakistan would gain in present circumstances by accession to the Treaty or by their, oemg accepted as a party to it would be the right to appoint a Consul at Muscat and they have already informed us tnat they do not desire consular representation in any oi tne Gulf States. R.E. Ellison, Esquire, Political Agent, Muscat.(E 9681/5442/91) CONFIDENTIAL.

There are also other treaties, multi-lateral and bi-lateral, having no localiseo application which India has inherited, but whicn will JJ 0 made Pakistan in regard to which arrangements need to be maae so that Pakistan can assume the position of an independent party in regard to then^. 2 The above., as I have said, represents the United Kingdom Government's view of the general position. Tn Governor-General Lieutenant-Colonel A.C. Galloway, C.I.E., O.B.E., Bahrain.2 Governor-General of India on the 14th August, 1947, made an order entitled the Indian Independence (International Arrangements) Crder 1947, of which a copy is enclosed, purporting to register an arrangement between the Governments of India and Pakistan which would determine their action in the international field. The order itself, we are advised, has no force in international law; it has legal force only as between the two Dominions and js not binding upon any foreign Government. It gave legislative force in the municipal law of India and Pakistan to an agreement between the two countries. Its value in international law is merely as a declaration of the intentions, so far as they themselves are concerned, of the Governments of India and Pakistan plus such status as it may acquire internationally by general consent, whether expressed or implied. The two Governments, however, have recently shown a'disposition to adopt the view that their position as regards international agreements and organisations has been regularised once and for all by that order and that they are entitled vis-A-vis other countries to rest their cases upon it. This is a matter of some delicacy for the Unitea Kingdom Government, since we do not wish to become embroiled in wrangles between the two Governments on matters of succession, nor do we : wish to get into the position of either seeming, or accepting liability, to give publicly any interpretation of the order or any views on the question of succession. The Commonwealth Relations Office recently wrote to the United Kingdom High Commissioner in Pakistan (Carter's letter to Grafftey-Smith of the 11th June) setting out the position on the above lines, and asking him to be guided by it if opportunities occurred to get these points discreetly into the head of the Pakistan Government. 4. We have thought it best to set this out at some length. • I now turn to the particular case of the Luscat Treaty of 1939. So far as India is concerned, the view of the United Kingdom Government is, for the reasons explained above, that the treaty is definitely binding in respect of the Dominion of India. As regards Pakistan, the Muscat Treaty does not appear to contain any obligations of the type which run with the land and which therefore automatically pass to Pakistan. If Pakistan decides to accede tc the Treaty there is no difficulty. If, however, she claims to be a party to the treaty by succession, it will rest with the Sultan, not with us, to decide whether to admit that claim. You will be aware that the Commonwealth Relations Office wrote to the Government of Pakistan on the 16th September, 1947, suggesting that the Government of Pakistan might examine the Muscat Treaty of 1939 and inform the United Kingdom Government in due course of the attitude they wished to adopt when the Sultan raised the question of this Traety's application to Pakistan. The views of the Pakistan Government have not yet been received, and a reminder is being sent to them. Meanwhile, we feel that it would be better to delay replying to the Sultan, at least insofar as the position of Pakistan is concerned and preferably as regardsregards Irdia’s position too. 5. At the same time, however, there is no question whatever but that the provisions of the Treaty applicable to nationals of His Majesty and British ships and aircraft ( as defined in Article I of the Treaty) apply to the nationals, ships and aircraft of Pakistan so long as she remains in the Commonwealth, and the views set out above in regard to Pakistan's position in international law as regards succession to treaties, etc., should not be allowed te in any way to derogate from the rights which persons, ships and aircraft of Pakistan domcile or registration enjoy as nationals of His Majesty, British vessels or British aircraft. This means, inter alia , that the important Articles 13-16 dealing with jurisdiction will continue to apply to Pakistan nationals qua nationals of His Majesty. There is no objection to this being made clear to the Sultan, as a separate issue from this question of India's and Pakistan's succession to the Treaty, if at any time the necessity arises. 6. Copies of this letter and the one under reply, are being sent to the United Kingdom High Commissioners in India and Pakistan. Yours ever, (SGD). B.A.B.

Will you please refer to your letter No. Pol (Ext) 17892/48 dated 30th November, 1948, about Pakistan’s position in regard to the Muscat Treaty of 1939. 2. The Pakistan Government’s letter was written without knowledge of the views contained in your telegram No. 1715 of the 16th October, the substance of wliich was conveyed to (Ikramullah (Secretary in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs) on 20th October in connection with the Siamese Treaty. 3. In my absence on tour, Slater discussed the Muscat Treaty with Akhtar Hussain, joint Secretary in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The letter said that the Pakistan Government were provisionally inclined to regard the United Kingdom interpretation of the legal position as correct, but they were reluctant to conm.it themselves for the present to any formal endorsement of this interpretation. ^Uchtar Hussain observed that the international law was by no means settled^ on this point, and suggested that the matter was so contentious that it might eventually have to be taken to the international court of justice. Meanwhile, Pakistan hoped to reserve her position.^ The question of accession to the Muscat Treaty was, he thought, somewhat academic; he could see no reason why the Sultan should make difficulties. But there might be other treaties in respect of which Pakistan would find tactical advantage in maintaining her claim tc inherit jointly w T ith India by virtue of clause 4 of the India Independence (International Arrangements) Order, and they would be socry tc compromise theii freedom in future negotiations by committing themselves to formal agreement with the United Kingdom view in respect of the Muscat Treaty. He wondered whether it would be possible for matters to be so arranged through the good offices of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf that the Sultan w r ould accept Pakistan's succession without insisting on a categorial admission by Pakistan that such acceptance was necessary. He hoped, in effect, that the Pakistan Government letter of 18th October would be allowed to stand as long as possible. 4. Akhtar Hussain concluded the interview by observing that the above were his peps purely personal views. He would have to discuss the matter with Ikramullah, and would let Slater know the result at the next interview. When Slater saw him in the following week, however, Akhtar Hussain said that he ha d not been able to consult Ikramullah, and he asked us to write demi-officially to his Ministry enquiring whether, in the light of the United Kingdom's interpretation of the legal position as explained in connection with the Siamese Treaty, the ninIstiy W( ul-&lt; wish to reconsider their letter of the 18th October about the Muscat Treaty. 5. This we have dons, and you will presumably not wish to take further action until their reply has been received. Mean while, I think you should know how matters now stand. 6.

The correspondence covers the following: the appointment of consuls by the British Government on behalf of India (as stipulated in the 1939 treaty), and whether this arrangement will continue once India becomes a republic; the question of whether the new dominion of Pakistan automatically remains a party to the treaty; the Sultan of Muscat and Oman's [Sa‘īd bin Taymūr Āl Bū Sa‘īd] intention not to renew the treaty, which is due to expire in February 1951.The file features the following correspondents: the Political Agent and Consul, Muscat; the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; the United Kingdom's High Commissioner for India; officials of the Foreign Office and the Government of Pakistan.Included with the correspondence is a copy of an order issued by Governor-General Mountbatten of Burma [Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma] on 14 August 1947 – an agreement regarding the devolution of international rights and obligations upon the dominions of India and Pakistan</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><geographic>Pakistan</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between Great Britain and Muscat (1939)</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Viceroy and Governor-General of India in Council</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM High Commissioner to India</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Treaties</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x000021#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
