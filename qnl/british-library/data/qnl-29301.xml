ApriX Dated Delhi, the 'Mare* 1921. Sir, I am directed to inform you that the Government of India have had under consideration the question of reducing the subsidy of Re.1,00,000 per annum paid to the Sultan of Maskat in recognition of his co-operation in the suppression of the Arms Traffic in the Persian Gulf. 2. As you are aware, this subsidy was originally granted to Sultan Felsal bin Turki, the father of the present Sultan, in 1911, and the arrangement then was that it should be personal to him. On the death of Feisal bin Turk! it was decided to continue It to his son, Saiyld Taimur bin Feisal, on condition that he agreed to prolong the Commercial Treaty of 1891 for a further period of 5 years, establish a Levy Corps and follow the policy.of his father in the suppression of the Arms Traffic in the Persian Gulf. 3. It is presumed ; though it is not clearly indicated^that the subsidy was also personal to Sultan Feisal, and since he has observed the conditions imposed on him and has lately reformed his administration, the Government of India consider that it might not unreasonably be regarded as an act of ban faith were the subsidy to be withdrawn or reduced,more especially as he has. at our request, recently expressed his adherence to the Arms Traffic Convention. These arguments will, however, lose their force with the accession of a new Sultan, fX 9 A / 9 x \ * ! Sultan, and it seems open to the Government of India in that eventuality to reconsider the position and to treat the question of withdrawal or curtailment as one of expediency in the light of the circumstances then prevailing. 4. I am to request that the Government of India may he furnished with your views on this matter at an early date. 5. A copy of this letter has been forwarded to the Political Agent, Maekat. I have the honour to he.

There is no doubt that the Arms Traffic subsidy was granted to Sultan Faisal bin Turk!, the father of tue present Sultan, personally. It was compensation to him for certain losses which he incurred an a result of establishing the Pn this respect it differs from Arms ’Warehouse at our request. the 'Zanzibar” subsidy, which it seems is the right of any on certain conditions Sultan who is acknowledged by the British Government, though actually even in this case it is not certain wh&amp;t these conditions are.( please see the note on page 500 of Lorlmer*s Gazeteer of the Persian Gulf ). In the absence of a written promise guaranteeing the payment of the Arms Traffic subsidy t to the successors of the original grantee, which written1 promise exists in the case of the Zanzibar subsidy ln the shape of Lord Cannings award of the 3 nd April i86i . the British Government it seems^ under no obligation to continue the payment of the Arms Traffic subsidy^after the ieath of Salyid Paiaal. 3. The circumstances in which the present Sultan, Salyld Talmur bin Faisal, was re -ran+^a +. &gt; recanted tne Arms Traffic subsidy l n addition to the Zanzibar subsidy were e*ce„+• v Rere exceptional. He was bj ' ’“ l * »»- ppotaoun, M . ln 'T**. “ S “° 0&gt;»” ». in .« 0 C..,_ 1 reoeliion against him.

Un3er ? -A.Mu B cat's No. 184 dated the leth 0-u°ber 1913, in wnich he announced hia Intention of fulfill- -in 5 all his father's engagements with the British Government eSPeClliny in th9 raatt ' er 0f which we have arranged for tne control of the arms traffic ' On to o i«n-c. on tne strength of thes&lt; ASsurancos t^i© rf*pr&gt; -ri-i -pt . ecognition of the British Government was accorded, but the question of the re&lt;-rant nf +i e -i errant of tne subsidies was to be considered later. Viewing the matter in the li ht of +■ —loitt of tne records it seem,, taut it was at this point a misunderstanding arose. The rscognitior by us of Saiyid Talmur on the strength of the assurances he had , ,, a secutj licuiotf* ‘ J fcn ahoula llavs aeant^automatically the continuance of the Zanzibar subsidy, while the question of the continuance of the Arras Traffic subsidy which had been personal to als father would need further consideration. The two subsidies seem however to have been regarded as subject to the same conditions as regards their continuance to Saiyid Talmur. They were continued to him on Mb fulfilling one condition only, namely on his consenting to prolong the Commercial Treaty for five years.(see telegram Ho.103 dated 33/1/14 from the Political Resident in the Persian ® u 1j- to the Political Agent at Muscat)-1 It is to be noted in this respect the question of regranting the subsidiee on condition that the Sultan agreed to establish a Levy Corps was definitely abandoned, and the Sultan had already agreed to follow the policy of his father in the suppression of the Arms Traffic, as has been shown above, but that this declaration had not affected the question of the regrant of the subsidies, which was considered quite separately* Finally on the Sultan prolonging the Commercial Treaty for five years, the Political Agent verbally announced to the Sultan the continuance of both subsidies (see letter No.34 dated li/3/14 from the P.A.Muscat to the Foreign and Political Department ). From the correspondence as a whole it seems that the real reason for the regrant of the subsidies was the impending financial collapse of the Sultan's administration. 4. From the above it seems that (1). The recognition of Saiyid Taimur as Sultan by the British Government was accorded on his making a satisfactory declaration as to policy* (3). In spite of this declaration the question of the regrant to him of both subsidies was held up and regarded as in no way following upon the official recognition. (3). Both subsidies were continued to him on his pro- -longing the Commercial Treaty for five years. No distinction was made between the two subsidies, and no letter was handed to the Sultan stating the conditions of the regrant, or whether either or both were personal to the Sultan. (4). Actually the Zanzibar subsidy is the right of all Sultans of Muscat recognised by the British Govern- -ment subject to their fulfilling certain conditions while the Arms Traffic subsidy was personal to Siyid Faisal, and continued to Taimur owing to c ertain exceptional circumstances.\ 6# . , manner in which the two eubaidies wera regranted lUL^ur yClr-l w rise to the presumption that the conditions underlying the regr&amp;nt in the case of each subsidy were precisely similar, and that therefore, following the precedent of the Zanzibar subsidy, both subsidies are the indefeasible right of the Sultans of Muscat recognised by the British Government upon certain conditions* It is, I venture to think, extremely probable that Saiyid Talaur regards them in this light* In the absence however of a written guarantee in the case of the Arms Traffic subsidy that it is to be continued te the successors of the original grantee, it must be presumed that the question of its continuance is to be e*CU 4/ “tecc^luudt Llr LlS reconsidered on the accession of a new Sultan. Once having K been granted, it is, I venture to think, impossible to with- -draw it from the grantee provided he gives no cause for our taking such action against him. Especially does this seem to be so in the case of the present Sultan for the reasons mentioned in para. 3 0 f the letter under reply, and owing to Lne c i-'cumstances in which the subsidy was continued to him. 6* Txie xoan of six and a half lakhs of rupees recently granted to the Muscat Government is upon the security of the sul si dies, if on the accession of a new Sultan it is decided to discontinue the Arms Traffic subsidy, it would be necessary to bear this in mind, and should any of the loan be still outstanding it might be considered as to whether tills portion o.t loan might not be foregone in view of the cessation of the subsidy. If I may venture a personal opinion it is that jdfc afcsMiaxfc* the Arms Traffic subsidy is no longer necessary and that it should be withdrawn at the earliest opportunity. But that as long as the present Sultan rules, and conforms to our wisnes it is impossible to withdraw it. Immediately he ceases to rule w© have the right to reconsider the whole question. At the same time the jjauckika® conditions of the payment of both subsidies should be regularised, and the Sultan himself shouldbe made aware of the position. Otherwise there is every reason to suppose that he may misunderstand it* ) &lt;• I have the honour to be V jasKKXHfladgcakHiiaiiKxaKKxatnt Sir, your most obedient servant I.C.S.

Trevor, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Subject:- Muscat Arms Traffic Subsidy. Sir, T have the honour to report that in accordance with the instructions eon ain in your Tender Secretary * s endorsement fo*46-S,, dated the X3th January 1922, 1 informed His Highness the Sultan in the course of an informal conversation at Karachi that the Arms Traffic subsidy had been personal to Saiyld Faisal but that it had pleased fovernmertfc to continue it to him also. Government however had now decided that the subsidy should cease when he ceased to rule. Hie Highness made no demur at the time but a few days later asked me if it was really the case that the subsidy had been personal to Saiyid Faisal. I replied that 1 thought there could be no doubt about thio but would look up the correspond ence and refer him to the relative documents. I have now studied the files at Muscat and at Bush ire. It is clear that Government intended that the subsidy should be personal to Saiyid Faisal but it is not clear that this was ever explained to him. The referencesreferences to it which I have cone across make it seem that the point that the subsidy was to be personal to Baiyid Faisal was unnoticed or was lost sight of. The principal reference seems to be the concluding portion of paragraph 8 of Sir Percy Cqx'b Merorandum of 7th November 19U to His Highness the Hu It an Saiyid Faisal a co :y of which was received at I uscat under Bushire endorsement N 0 .3046,dated the 2nd December 1911. This reads 'Yet we recognise the difficulty of your position and are prepared to give you reasonable compensation, in the increase of your subsidy by so much per month or |per annum, in consideration of your adopting these i: ar rang era ent r&lt;, an d so long as they are effective ly maintainsd w . In tlie absence of anything to the contrary the words I have underlined would seem to convey the impression that the contract was a permanent one. It now seems to me that Saiyid Taimur must have consulted his State papers before asking me if it was really the cane that the subsidy had been personal to Saiyid Faisal. X know he had these papers with him. In any case it is now necessary to show him that it was made known to Paiyid Faisal that the subsidy was personal to him or to restate the position or to reopen the original bargain. I have therefore the honour to request that this matter be further examined and that I be furnished with instructions how to proceed. Actually the subsidy goes to the usci t ft at e and not to Saiyid Taimur S' personally. The looil to the State from the cessation of arms traffic has been considerable and it could not at present meet its liabilities without the aid of the arms traffic subsidy. If therefore there is any question of modifying the decision that the subsidy should cease when faiyid Taimur ceases to rule I submit it would be best as xfcxxxx suggested in paragraph 3 of Foreign* ^ i (, &lt;?') Foreign and Political Department letter T 0.496 -^,a. f dated the 14th April 1921, to you that the Government, of India should reconsider the position on Saiyid T airmr* $ ceasing to rule and to treat the question of withdrawal or curtailment of the arms subsidy as one of expediency in the light of circumstances then prevailing.

We contradicted hi® saying that such compensation cannot be meant for that person in particular who rules this state, but its profit la meant for him an! his successors in the State of Muscat and Oman.

SalyU Faisal.f I / The real reason for the Sultan’s attitude on this question ls # I venture to suggest, the obstacle which the decision of Government puts in the way of an eventual abdication on his part in favour of hi® son rhen the latter is. of age. As regards the remarks in the Sultan’s letter concerning the treaties and engagements entered into with the British Government by himself or his predecessors, the Slave Trade treaties, the Telegraph agreement of 1864, Lord Canning’s award, and the undertaking regarding cession of territory of 1891 are binding on the signatories and their successors. The Commercial Treaty, the undertaking regarding the Sur coalfields, the Arms traffic arrangements of 1913 and the recent Oil agreement are not. It is probable tnat we may expect some difficulty over the renewal of the Commercial Treaty next year, and that the Sultan will demand the right to raise the customs dues. In view of the decision conveyed in Foreign Department memorandum No .1368/15 1 ( 3 )-Ext. of the ?th December 1932, it seems tnat the matter cannot be reopened. I venture to think that an authoritative reply from you to this effect is all that Is necessary. Should you accept this view I could hand over to the Cuitan such letter as you may consider necessary to send. I have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedient servant / 2.C.S. Political Agent, Muscat.X venture to supplement iemi-offlelalljr t&amp;e fourth paragraph of ay letter Mo. ^ of the 34th instant regarding the real reason why the Sultan has taken exception to the decision that the Arma Traffic subsidy should cease on-htsdeath. The Sultan’s one object In Ilf® is to abdicate, eventually as he is not allowed to do it now. When he went to India In 1980 you remember this actually why he wanted to see the Viceroy. He tick the decision against abdication badly at tae time, openly said he would be an unwilling Sultan In name because we wanted it. It was however gradually brought horns to him that we expected him to assume some responsibility and to take some interest in hie state. He realised that personal supervision could not but benefit hie revenues, and that if he played the game now Hovormaent would be far more likely to listen to him later if h® could put up a reasonable case, such that his son was of age and well educated and that the state revenues were flourishing. At the same time the collapse of his dream of love in a cottage (at Dehra Dun ) with Ms Turkish wife, has him willing to stay some time in Unseat. On this« never rv •ptaoie of Uls life he quite openly “ay 6 again** • But this la all polley. I Burs he never lost eight of hie original goal. When *« «* ln Muscat before he nore than once hintei to ne that in the future if euitable arrangenente couli be aaie - he hoped to be allowed to go. The tb0 A.T. subsidy will cease when he ceases to rule ha. thrown his plans out of gear. He now .mows that the financial management of his state, barring the rais- -ing of the customs dues or an oil stride will always he difficult. But it is quite possible that with careful management and the continuance of the subsidies the state could afford to pension him. «* say in fire or ten years time when Salyld Said la fit to carry on. Such pension would of course haw to be paid through ua as be would not dare to trust the caprice of his successor. If hie retirement woul^ mean the cessation of the A.T.subsldy. he *nows that . nf t.Hnt, retirement back. This is of course all conjecture on ay part, but It is based on a somewhat Intimate knoietge of H.H’s character. I cannot imagine that he would 8T * r bother about the cessation of the subsidy after .Sait Is becaus® it will c^ess ho o@®s©g to pal© that he is agitate! # I Lave venture! to aek you to reply personally as Resident to the Sultan in tnis matter as after the decision of CJovermaent we clearly cannot go on arguing, ant5 an authoritative an! snort answer that Government cannot alter their decision should stop fUrhter correspondence. We must be prepare! however for a little trouble In the matter of renewing the Commercial Treaty so a iireet conse- -quence. It would be possible for me personally to explain to the Sultan when I hand over your reply # that it is not worth his while meeting trouble half way, an! that in the distant day when he ceases to rule circumstances may be quite different an! may necessitate Government making tautk agreements with hia successor, but I am doubtful of the wisdom of such a course unless you think it would be useful.No. of 1923. * * t- His Highness Saiyid Taimur bin Faiscal bin Turki, C.S.

Your Highness once more represents that the grant was hereditary and not personal ; and requests that the High Government may be moved to reconsider the case . i to have to make it quite clear to Your Highness that the High British Government *s decision was absolutely finals anc, that no advantage whatever would come from representing the matter to it &gt;gain : more especially as I myself was closely con cernea in the negotiations which led to the suppression of the Arms Traffic , and would be obliged to confess to the High Gov- ernment that the subsidy in question was meant as a p-ersonal gift to Sultan Faisal for his life time only; and so it was under stood by all of us- As your father’s death, which I have never ceased to deplore , followed so closely alter the conclusion of that Agreement, the High Government, no doubt , among other im portant reasons , thought it desirable that the Muscat ruling family should hot thus be deprived of reasonable compensation for the loss to which they were put by uhe decrease of the Arms - Traffic; and therefore continued the subsidy as a favour to Your Highness , the successor of Sultan Faisal . But the Government never did , and never could have contemplated its continuance for ever . l much regret that it is necessary for me to write this to Your Highness , but I sincerely hope that it may be a very long time Delore your wise rule ceases.

This subsidy was granted to the Sultan of -iuscat under Lord Oannia*'a Award of 1361 as eoa^enaation for the abandonment of his claims over -anaibar, and was ori a i«*lljr payable uy the Sultan of -anbitar, Owiiia, however to constant delays in payment by the latter ruler responsibility for its payment was assumed in 1873 by the Government of India so long as the 'Sultan 'continued faithfully to fulfil hia treaty®nga&amp;m«nt« arid nmltmnt trim&amp;wfaiv toarards the Sritieh 0oTeraiaent w # the oo»t being divided equ^li.j between the Britieh and Indian Oove^nmente.

In 1921 however, in considering the question of the reduction of the Arms traffic subsidy, 'the political Agmt, Muscat, expressed the view that the ^nzi'mr subsidy was, subject to certain not very clear conditions, the right of any Sultr-n recognised by the British Government a view which was concurred in by the resident, vide Buehire Icvter Ho. 13S-B of 13th June 1931, and it be assumed that the \rovernment of India also concurred as they instructed the Beeident to explain to the Sultan the terms of both the bar and the A r ma Traffic subsidy - vide their memorandum ho. 1543-h*/ *, dated 29th mecember 1921. /hether any communication wag isade to the Sultan at the time my records do not show, but presumably gome verfe&amp;l intimation at any rate was given to His Highness, since in his letter lio.32-B, dated 22nd Gap timber, which formed an enclosure to Bushire letter ^o.790*3 of 22nd October 1922, the political Agent reported that the Sultan had discussed with Mm the nature of the Arms Traffic subsidy, i-io further reference however is mad# in any correspondence of the .lanxitrir subsidy find I think it will fee seen from the above brief summary of the history of this subsidy that the Government | of India have accepted the view that it is an absolute subsidy granted to the Julian of Muscat subject only to his living in terms of amity and friendship with Mis Majesty** Gove ament and full'tiling his treaty engagements. b. The Arms Traffic sub sidy is however on a totally 1 ptx^Ja .si / 1 * r dil erent basis, it ms originally granted to Uiiyid Taimur in 1912 in return for an undertaking on hi* part to establish a bonded warehouse in which anas and ammunition would be deposited on Importation. On the death of Haiyid Faisalthe following, ywr it was decided to continue the subsidy to UmlyU Taimur on certain conditions, Out, a® explained above, a&lt;Me oonfueion arose owing to the two aufesiaies* imring ^een treated a® though they were on the same baeia, although one was a permnent subsidy and the other &amp; personal one. ^ ri 19E1 the Government of India oonsidared tiie question of the reduction of the Arm® TrafTic subsidy ana S&amp;iyid f&amp;lmur appears to have argued th.t since they were both continued on the omm terns the Arms Traffic subsidy was also an absolute one* The Government of i ndia however { vide foreign and Political iiepartment letter Ao* i26d/X5i(2)*.i?«xt*, dated 7tii December 1922) decided that it was personal to dalyid Faisal and that it was only eonfc inued to Baiyid Taimur as a favour, and in 1923 the then Political esident,Colonel Knox, informed aiyid Taimur to this effect in a personal letter, and 1 think it is quit© clmr that, while the Muscat State am claim the continuance of the -.anxibar subsidy as a right so long as they live m terns of amity with His Majesty’s Govern- meat, they cannot claim any continuance of the Arms traffic subsidy, l have perhaps discussed this letter at unnecessary length, but as a good deal of confusion regarding these two subsidies seems to have arisen in the past 1 have thought it desirable to emphasis© the distinction, ?♦ The Government of India and His Majesty's Government # however, are interested in the stability of the Muscat finances. For many years past the f in uncos of the Htate imvc been under the management of a : uropean Adviser and the Government of India I have granted it loans, during the past year the Muscat state, like almost every other Ktate, has been passing through a period of acute financial difficulty$ despite this however during the past 12 months special efforts have been made to put the finances of the Htate in order by reducing ex^nditure and increasing «• *p ■ } fyi&gt; C-'LC* i iui? 1 - fjjpM- increasing reTenues,and despite the adverse oircuuistances they teve met with a very large measure of suacesa* I aua hopetul that with the accession of a young and energetic and relatively well-educated ruler there will ue a steady improvement. Unfortunately, however, the resources of the State are slender, and for the next few years at any rate the management of the finances will need great care and the exercise of the strictest economy, ln order that the Government of India, and His Majesty 1 s Government might fee apprised of the financial position of the ■State, 1 asked Colonel Fowls to let me have a statement showing tile ts&amp;ate s li&amp;bilities and the Budget for the current year* I forward herewith a copy of the Political .Agent * @ mem or and vn enclosing the budget. It will be seen that the last year osed with a balance of about Hs.30,000* which 1 understand has been devoted chiefly to the repayment of the Government of India loan* His Highness the Multan is most anxious to liquidate this loan as soon as possible, as, unlike the State’s other liabilities, it bears interest. Hi® Highness hopes to pay it off entirely during the current year* There will then only remain the debts to local merchants, the chief being the spn of the late Khan )ahadur Motscunmsd Haoito* I su^ested to Hi® Hi^iness thiit a coiamittee should be appointed to investigate these claims and 1 hope they will be susceptible of reduction* ^* “i-t will be seen from the budget for the current year that ignoring the debts the receipt® are estimated at Ks.7,02,100 while the expenditure comes to s*6,76,300, leaving a balance of R®.26,800. JS© provision has been made in the expenditure for the Ix-SuXtan 1 s allowance of Ra*24,000 per annual, and if this i® taken into account there is only left a margin of Ks. 1,800* fur the r, His Highness’ personal fur tiier, His Highness’ personal | allowance * * •allowance has been fixed at if. 3,000 per ai&gt;d ^ inforjaed me that hhtle dui-in^ the present oriais h« waa willing to try j and ammee on this sum, U was really quite inadequate if he me in any vmy to mint*,in hie position as Ruler of the state. ,ith this view I am in agreementi apart from the necessary domestic expenditure, there are «aqy oalls upon the purse of an Arab ruler, and if we are to build up, as I hope we sha11 in oour#0 01 tiae succeed in doing, the personal influence and authority of the Ruler of Muscat, it is desirable j that he should be able suitably to receive and entertain n ■shaikhs irom the interior adto come and visit him. I would mention that Shaikh Hamad of Bahrain receives from various sources about is. 1,80,000 per annua, and he informed me on the occasion of my recent visit that this sum was quite in adequate, and that he did not know how to sake both ends meet, .jhaitth iiaawd, I admit, is not a particularly happy example to quote, for he has little idea of the value of money and woulc probably be always hard up whatever his income was, but/any rate it will be seen that the privy purse at Muscat is now- a-days less than half that of the Suler of Safari in. 10. utepa have already been taken to reduce the family allowances, the only two exceptions beti% the al owances drawn by ouiyid Kadlr and Saiyid fhyiab. Saiyid faimur made a special request to Saiyid Said that these allowances should not be reduced and naturally daiyid Said does not wish so early in v ue reign to ignore his father's wishes or to antagonise his influential uncle. Apart from this X do not think the budget ©all® for more detailed comments than it has received V in Colonel if© wle * &amp; mm or and urn* il* 1 a,is hopeful that it May be possible to enhance the customs tariff during the current year* if *© it should /ti ^ . ; ;n be possible to obtain increased revenue from cue toms, and further, the action which we are now taking at Aiqa should finally settle once and lor all the difficulties hitherto experienced at 3ur, taxi enable a more effective control to be exercised at that important port* I-ot only that but it should have a satiafacto y reper* cussion tiifoughout the State and should facilitate collection of revenue at Sohax and elsewhere. It will be clttar, however, from the budget that if the Arms Traffic subsidy of one lakh is withdrawn immediately there is no possibility of the State being aoie t0 i3aial3CC it8 budget, and it must again sink into its former condition of insolvency and debt* aiven, however, support on the coast in the maintenance of its authority and financial assistance in the form of a continuance of the subsidy for a few years more, until it has liquidated its liabilities and finally re-organised its finances, X share the view expressed by the * oli tic&amp;i .-.gent that it should then be able, with the return of more normal commercial conditions, to be entirely self-supporting 1 would tj ter el ore urge that as an act of grace the Government of India should agree to continue the subsidy for a further period of three years in the first instance, it is difficult to fore cast the future, and it seems not improbable that it will be necessary to maintain the subsidy for five years, but if the tariff rates are enhanced and trade improves and the authority of the State is firmly established along t e coast it is possible that three years may suffice, 1 would therefore ask that it should be extended for Uixm years in the first instance with a proviso that the matter should be re-examined at the end of this period in the light of the circumstances then prevailing, I regret the delay that has occurred in the submission of this report but as the Government of India are aware, I have been almost continuously ,,,&gt;&amp;. continuouuly on the move for the Xagt two aontha. 1 Bm aendin 6 8 copy-of this despatch to Hi Majesty’s Secretary of State for- India. 5 i iiave tile honour to be, Sir, four ssoet obedient servant, sd/~ H.?,Biscoe, Colonel, * olitical Hesident In the Persian Gulf, v,oxjy forwarded to the Political Agent, Muscat.

In agreeing w ith his vie w s I told Mr. Metcalfe that I thought one of these provisions should be such as to give us considerable say as to ho A the money v? as spent •» in other ^ords w e must have sufficient control to see that the grant is no t frittered a^ay and misspent and that certain de finite vV orks are carried out.

The uultan appeared quite agreeable to the proposals as a whole except that of the investment of lb 35,000 in Government of x na i a stock for the purpose of providing an income towards the salary of the school masters. He declared nc hau some 2 lakhs invested in Government of India Stock the revenue from which would be sufficient to more than pay the salaries of the teachers of the school and he would be willing to earmark this amount for the purpose 4. The oultan said he had already re-opened the school some months ago though the number of pupilts was at present small. The school a* psemmt is in a hired private house out the dultan declares there is a State building available which at the cost of only some fis 5 , 000 /- could be made into an excellent school.house* 5* I stressed the importance (on the lines of paragraph 3 (c) of your letter quoted above) of obtaining through you a suitable man for the post of school-master. His Highness replied he already had an excellent man - one Ismail Jaiffendi - a Palestine Arab who had been engaged through the British The Hon'ble Lieut-Colonel T.C.Fowle, C.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, B u s h i r e#autnoritiea there and so was above suspicions In this connection please see paragraphs 17-19 of dreamer's despatch ^o.C/57 of 11 th February 1935. having Just arrived 1 cany of coai*se 9 give no opinion concerning Ismail dffendi but from all that 1 have been able to gather it appears he is definitely anti-British and makes no secret of the fact* 6 * one of the bultan*s pet schemes is that of repairing the forts not only of Muscat and Matrah but of some dozen or 30 coastal towns and villages, mexitioned this idea the first day I discussed the spending of the suosiuy with him and I said I was doubtful if it would be acceptable to you or the Government of rndia since it could hardly be said to come under the category of social sexvices on which he had promised you he would spend the subsidy money* This morning I went to see him to get a final decision regarding condition* Corps for the commandant of the ^evy/and when 1 was about to leave he remarked that he had been working out some suggestions for expenditure on sanitation etc. and as regards the repair on the forts he thought Hs.19000 would be neededi He added he would not discuss the matter then but would do so in detail on Saturday when he is to see me again. 7. xn view of the fact that you are going on leave very shortly and the uultan is himself leaving —uscat at the end of the month on a tour of the oucinah and will be away some 5 weeks I thought it advisable to let you know how the discussions have gone and to ask for instructions as to the attitude I should take with the dultan concerning the proposed expenditure on the forts and generally about Ismail Effendi.

This will probably be the stumbling block. I pointed I to His Highness that when the question of the continuation of the subsidy was being discussed with you last year t*e promised that if continued he would expend the whole amount in social services in x^is State and that th£se could scarcely be said to include the repair of forts. He replied that when yau told him you would try and get the Government ox Inaia to extend the subsidy for another year, you declared It was necessary to make as good a case of it as possible, which, in your opinion, could best be achieved by saying the money would be spent on social services* His Highness added, he understood from your remarks that he was not therefore to be bound down too strictly as regaras the objects on which he would actually spend the money. This statement of his is, of course, inconsistent with his definite promise given you, vide paragraph gestion and might 1 be adopted. 2 of your letter Ho.486-S of 29th May to Foreign \ ■ :&lt;r 3* The Sultan seemed very keen on having this money j,or the forts. 1 should like to have your instructions as to whether you wish me to press him at least to agree to reducing the allotment on this Head. 4* If Matrah is to be included in the Rs 40,000/- ailotted for improvements of sanitation (vide item 1 above) something more will be required. If you agree I could I ■, / endeavour to persuade the Sultan to reduce the expenditure on the forts by Rs 10,000/- which would be added to the Rs 40,000/- of item ( 1 ). A. 5. There is,of course, another point of view of the \ /v, ■ case which might be considered. This is the first time, I I understand, that we have ever tried to exercise a complet ' / As control over the Sultan in the expenditure of subsidy money■fSrs. m. As he aas met our demands in the present instance more or less half way perhaps it would he wise not to press f 6 r all our proposals. t ovm v ^ ew that it would do no harm to try once more to persuade the Sultan at least to agree to a certain amount of reduction on the amount to be spent on the forts i.e, by at least 1G } 000 rupees as per paragraph 4 above. 7. i'he Sultan is leaving Muscat for his tour of the Batineh on Wednesday next by the up slow mail.

I thought it advisable not to do this as it appeared to me that if the Gultan knew that there was a chance of the subsidy being resumed later on, should the condition of the unseat finances justify it, he would soon see that the present satisfactory credit balance of over three and a half .Lakhs was rapidly wiped out to give him an opportunity to press for a renewal of the grant.

Reference paragraph d of draft. An important point is (a) whether the 1925 Convention 'has not yet been brougnt into operation H vide Mr.Caroe’s letter, para. 2 , i.e. that it is not binding even on tne present signatories until a ceftain nuiaber of otner Governments have ratified it, or whether (b) present signatories carry out its provisions as far as they themselves and the other signatories are concerned. If (b) then it might be some use asking Sultan to adhere to the Convention; if (a) then there is no safeguard in asking the Sul-tan to adhere to a dead letter. Doubtless this point will be taken up by Government of India when the correspondence gets to the stage of reaching them.this decision doubtless arose from a genuine belief in the absolute nature of the Arms Traffic Subsich^* As pointed out by faroe, the Sultan f s engagement was definitely in the I mature of a qu id prp_ puo and as we have on our nart cancelled the quo i,e. the Arms Subsidy, personally I am of opinion that in equity, and nrobebly in law, the guitar or his part is released from the quid i.e. his engagement of loip. This, as you will see^ is Caroe^ opinion ai so* 4* In these circumstances it is necessary to consider (a.) whether there are any other restrictions on the Sultan to prevent his engaging, if he so desires, in the Arms Traffic, and (b) whether It is necessary to engage in any fresh agreement with Muscat in this matter. 5. As regards (a) • The i.919 P rms Traffic Convention to which the Sultan adhered, has been replaced by the 1925 Convention, to which the Sultan aid not adhere, and which itself has not yet been brought into operation as it has hitherto been ratified only by the United Kingdom, Iran and United States of America, 6 , The Sul-tanls Proclamation and Notification dated 13th Kanuary 1898 (Treaties and Undertakings in Force between the British Government and the Sultans of Muscat and Oman 1845- 1914 No. 8 (a) and 8 (b) respectively) prohibit the export of arms and ammunition from Muscat to India and Persia and give British and Persian vessels of war the right to search Muscat vessels in the Indian, Persian and Muscat territorial waters. Owing to the right that these two documents accord to Persian vessels of war it is undesirable to draw atten tion to them; in fact, in connection with the general question /y -4- question of the Arms Traffic Convention the view was expressed ^ the T nr 1 i?. Office that it might he desirable to ?hvcse the Sultan to cancel the Proclamation i898. ?T aveover they are of a unilateral nature and there is presumably nothing inherent in them to prevent the Sultan auu!!. 1 ne them, on his own initiative* his letter, dated 1Oth February 1938, which the present Sultan addressed to the Political Resident on his accession, the former gave an assurance, inter a lia* that he would b e guided by the views of His Majesty*s Government ^ 10 -important matters and this assurance might perhaps he regarded as restricting t&gt;&gt;e Sultan from going contrary to the wishes of His Majesty*s Government in regard to the Arms |] Traffic * As, however, the latter was the occasion of a definite agreement with the Sultan, and we our side ^ave cancelled our part of the bargain, I do not think that we could use this assurance to make the Sultan keep his side. 8 8 . As regards (b). From the practical point of view, there would not apoear to he much inducement for the Sultan to encourage the use of Muscat as a basis for the Arms ^raffle. For his own sake he is not likely to encourage the importation of arms for sale in his own territories, whefce they might well he used against him by the Omani tribes, as far a° the Saudi Government is concerned they are in a position to import their arms dir^ct from the manufacturers in - ny country they like, and are therefore mast unlikely to procure arms indi rectly via Muscat, Owing to the disarming of the tribes in Persian Baluchistan and the increasing authority there of the Central Government the /Oculi cl^n ^ 1 5 o re ign and Po 1 itical Department,v New Delhi f The /$/ A pril 1936 . . ,x D*t .Mo.D. x402-N/36. ail you please refer to your demi-official letter sc. Iu7-S, dated the 12th February 1936, on the subject of the actiTities of the ex-Sultan of Muscat? You will remember that this point was discussed in Delhi, and that it was pointed out that the Sultan's engagement under his notification of the 1st June 1912, whereby he undertook that all arms imported should pass throu^i a special warehouse at Muscat, was definitely in the nature of a ouir, p r » ^ The tem3 oa which he agreed to this settlement were that he rhoula receive in compensation an annual payment of As. 1 lakh. The point is mentioned in paragraphs 11-13 of the Incia Oxiice Muscat Memorandum revised up to the 25th August 1928. In as much as the annual arms subsidy has been discontinued with effect from the 1st January 1936, it would appear that the Sultan is now released from his engagement in this respect. 0. It is time that Muscat adhered to the 1919 Anas Traffic Convention. This, however, was replaced by the 1925 AiWjo Iiaffic Convention, which itself has not yet been brought into operation as it has hitherto only been ratified by the United Kingdom, Iraq, and the United States of America, and the Sultan does not appear to have adhered to it. .1. It seems .therefore, that the Sultan is now under no engagementengagement to prevent traffic in anna into and through hia territories. This point doss not seem to nave been realised at the time when it was decided to agree to the discontinuance of the firms Subsidy with effect from last January (see your demi-official letter to Sir Aubrey letcalfe Ko. 848-3, dated the 7th November 19351 The Government of India will be glad if you will carefully consider the position thus disclosed, and say nether in your opinion it is necessary to enter into any ire ;h agreement with Muscat in this matter.

I think that the aultan would be exceedingly chaiy of allowing the importation of anna into Muscat with the object of re-export and sals since it ia obvious that it would not be difficult for the Omanis to get hold of sane of these weapons and he would then be hoist with his own petard with a vengeance. In fact it can safely be said that in these days so far as Muscat is concerned the bottom has dropped out of the Arms Traffic market. 6 * r ' iU ' e is ho *ever another reason which even more powerfully than those above mentioned would,I believe, operate to prevent the Sultan from ever venturing to allow or encourage traffic in anas and that is his i ealiaation oi the complete and utter dependence of ais -fate for its continued existence, upon the support #£ His Hsjssty's Qovernment. His Highness is under no ueiusions in this respect and the fear of the conse- Huences would, i believe, always debar him from doing anything, which although he might have legal and moral light on hia side, would, he knows nevertheless,scarcely tail to be considered as amounting to a hostile act against Great Britain. In the course of conversation wit* the Sultan during my last visit to jjtoofar he remarked that he fully realised that his State derived considerably more advantages from its close connection with His Majesty's Government than the latter did frosi any treaties or agreements entered into between the two countries. V. Under the circumstances 1 am in complete agreement with the views expressed in paragraph 8 of your letter that it is not necessary at present far us to enter into any fresh agreement with the Sultan and should the fact ever strike him that he is now free fromfroa hid obligations not to allow traffic in arms, he would undoubtedly address us in the matter before taking any action.

Political Agency and H.K's Consulate Muscat, the 18th December 1937 . From The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Buehire. The oulton 1 s application for the resumption Qa. the payment of the Arms Traffic subsidy. Sir, With reference to Item Ibc 9 of the Hot® - copy of which I understand has been forwarded to you - of the discussions held on the 17th Hovember 1937 between Sir Aubrey Metcalfe, Secretary to the Govermncnt of Indio in the External Affairs Department and His High ness the Sultan of Muscat, at which I was present, I have the honour to forward herewith copy of a letter dated the 20th November 1937 from the Sultan in which he makes a formal application for the resumption of the payment of the Arms Traffic Subsidy. 2• It will be noted that the Sultan twice asserts in hie letter that he is M entitled** to this subsidy end that ho fully explained this point both to His Excellency the Viceroy and the Secretary in the External Affaire Department but there is no mention of hie having done so in the note of his interview with them nor did he in subsequent discussions with me on the subject. As you ore aware the Sultan f s knowledge of English is good but not perfect and he frequently mokes use of words and expressions which he docs not y fully/ully understand. I think this hoe happened in this instance tut as no cose has ever teen made out by him for being 'entitled' to the subsidy this particular point in his letter may perhaps be ignored. 3 ' Thc second reason mentioned by the 3 ultan os a ground for resumption of the Arms Subsidy is the bod condition of the finances of his Government. In this connection I would refer you to my letter JC ISo. 1520/320 dated the 16th December 1937 with whieh was forwarded a statement showing the financial situation of the State on let October 1937. it will be seen therefrom that on that date the assets in cash and realisable securities after deducting refund able deposits and loans were Be. 3,24,563. For the next five years moreover the ^ pm - State will be in receipt of Ks. 84,000 per annum from Petroleum Concessions Limited under the terms of the Agreement concluded between the Company and the Sultan in June of this year. The initial payment of Ks. 1,75,000 made by Petroleum Concessions Limited to the Sultan when the Concession was signed has not, it seems, been included in the financial statement and I suspect is looked upon by Hie High ness as his private property though it might well be taken os rightly belonging to the 3 tnte. I fell to see, therefore, any justificotior for the jess resumption of the Arms Traffic Subsidy on the grounds of the alleged financial stringency of the State. 4 • As regards the possibility of the recrudescence of the Anas Traffic arising in Muscat referred/P •* 3 «• referred to in paragraph 10 of the Note of the bultun 1 s discusBions with the Secretary in the External Affaire Department and paragraph 5 of the record of the interview accorded to the Sultan by His Excellency the Viceroy, 1 have nothing further to add to the remark© made in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 of my demi-official letter Ko. C/70 doted 10th June 1936. ^ ^• The Sultan^ letter in question was received on 21st Kovember and I had intended original ly to forward it from Bombay under my covering letter Ho. T/92 dated November 26th. After consider ation, however, I held back my letter - which may now be considered os cancelled - as I decided it was essentia! to forward, as the same time as the Sultan's letter, the last quarterly statement of the financial position of the Muscat State.

I am unable to follow your line of reasoning in two points of your letter*^ ^*1 * \flrt ^ ^ (a) The initial payment of Rs. 1,75,000 (this sum in your telegram Ker^r R.22, dated 12th July 1937, was given as Rs. 1,78,000) made by Petroleum Concessions Limited to the Sultan when the concession was signed. According to my calculation this should read Rs. 1,54,000 made up of the sums of Rs. 1,00,000 and R s, 30,000 paid on the signature of the declaration of the Muscat and/and Dhofar conceaaions reapectiyely under Article 4 of both concesaione and in addition 5 months advance of the monthly sum specified in article 4 of the concession i.e. RS. 15,0C0 and Rs. 9,000 respectively.

By this, I presume you mean the annual payment of Rs. 84,000 under Article 6 (b) of the Muscat concession. This payment, however, is not to commence until 'the Company declare ...... its intention to take up the concession etc.,' and this has not yet occured. As far as I can see, the Sultan at the moment is now drawing Ra, 96,000 per annum under Article 4 of the two agreements. How do you reconcile your statement v/ith the above ?

' 1 have the honour to report that in accordance with the instructions contained in your Under-Secretary«s endorsement No. 46, dated the 13th January 1932, X informed His Highness the Sultan in the course of an informal conversation at Karachi that the ARMS TRAFFIC SUBSIDY had been personal to Saiyid Faisal but that it had pleased Government to continue it to him also Government however had now decided that the subsidy should cease when he ceased to rule. His Highness made no demur at the time but a few days later asked me if it was really the case that the subsidy had been personal to Saiyid Faisal. I replied that I thought there could be no doubt about this but would look up the correspondence and refer him to the relative documents. 2. I have now studied the files at Muscat and at Bushire. It is clear that Government Intended that the subsidy should be personal to Saiyid Faisal but it is not clear that this was ever ex- -plained to him The references ,to it which I have come across make it seem that the point that the subsidy was to be personal to Saiyid Faisal p.lSl waskinnoticed or was lost sight of. The principal reference seems to be the concluding portion of paragraph/2 * paragraph 8 of Sir Percy Cox’s Memorandum of 7th November 1^11 to His Highness the Sultan Saiyid Faisal a copy of which was received at Muscat under Bushire endorsement No. 3046 # dated the 2nd jjeeember 1911# This reads ” Yet we recognise the difficulty of your position and are prepared to give you reasonable compensation, In.the increase Qf—your subsidy by so much per month or per annum, in consideration of your adopting these arrangements, and 3g-lflag..aB they are effectively maintained. 1 * In the absence of anything to the contrary the words I have underlined would seem to convey the impression that the contract was a permanent one. Ibid 2 In 1921, vide Government of India memorandum No. 496 S.A., of 14th April, to P.H., Government of India proposed reducing the Arms Subsidy. In his letter No.897 of 29th May 1921 Mr. Viingate (Political Agent, Muscat) gave the circumstances in which Sultan Taimur was regranted the Arms Traffic Subsidy. This letter was forwarded to Government of India under P.H’s letter Ibid p.151 N0.138-S of 13th June 1921. Briefly the Arms Subsidy and the Zanzibar Subsidy were treated as being on the same foot ling • Sultan Taimur xu promised to fulfil his father’s engagements and consented to prolong the Commercial Treaty of 18^1 for five years. (Para 3 of Mr. Wingate’s letter? see also para 4)• In 1922 Sultan Taimur was informed that the dI.N-67 3 .181 Arms Traffic Subsidy hwd been personal to Sultan Faisal and was therefore personal to Taimur.

The question has now been further considered and I am desirea to inform you that the Government of India agree with Fowl 0 that there is not a strong case for the restoration of the subsidy. They are moreover doubtful if the object, which is sought to be obtained, namely greater control over the Sultan's foreign relations, could be secured by its restoration. Apart from the merits of the case they consider that it would not be possible to justify the annual payment of a lakh of rupees from Indian revenues solely in order to obtain greater control over the Sultan s foreign relations, since the purely Indian interests involved are comparatively unimportant. They would not there fore be willing to contribute towards the subsidy and feel that they must h ave the question of its restoration to be declined by His Majesty's Government. 3. I am sending a copy of this letter to Weightman. Yours sincerely, Sd. H. A. F. Metcalfe. J.G.Walton, Esquire, C.B., M.C., India Office, London.r v Copy. P.Z.2936/38. SECRET. Muscat Arms Traffic Subsidy . My dear Metcalfe, tould you kindly refer to your demi-official letter of the 19th April, No.D. 1204-1C/38, on the subject of the arms traffic subsidy formerly paid to the Sultan of Muscat. 2. The Sultan made nor eference while in London to his request tor the renewal of the subsidy. It is necessary how ever to send a reply to the Sultan's letter of the 20th November 1937 ( copy enclosed withPowle* s letter to you of the 17th March, No.204-S)» The Secretary of State notes that in this letter the Sultan claims that he is entitled to the subsidy. Before deciding on the terms of the reply to be sent to the Sultan the Secretaiy of State would be glad to receive the viev/s of the Government of India on this claim in the light of the history of the subsidy. In this connection I am to enclose copy of a note prepared in this Office from which it appears that the subsidy was intended as compensation for loss of revenue from duty on imported I arms, that there is no r ecord of Sultan Faisal being told that the subsidy was personal to him, and that on Sultan Taimur claiming that, as he had undertaken his father's obligations, the allowances paid to his father should be continued, it was decided to continue the subsidy on condition that revision of the 1891 Treaty was postponed. 3. Certain other considerations which might be held to warrant a renewal of the subsidy have been discussed in Fowle's letter of the 17th March. They are (a) /(a) S seri oug deterioration in the Muscat financial position. On the facts mentioned in Powle's letter there is no evidence of any immediate danger of this, even allowing for the smail decrease in revenue which will result from the decision not to renew the Civil Air Agreement consequent upon the transfer of the Imperial Airways base from Gwadur to Jiunri, (b) to prevent a recrudescence of the Arms Traffic. It is noted that in Fowle’s view there is no real danger of the renewal of gun-running frm Muscat and that the Government of Inaia think that if the arms traffic should ever become a live issue it could be dealt with by other means than the grant of a subsidy. (parsons' telegram to Walton of the 12th September, No.1946). It would be useful however if Powle could give us a further expression of his views on this point in the light of the evidence which has recently come to notice of the existence of a certain amount of traffic in arms across the Persian Gulf via Debai# (c) as a help in the Treaty negotiations. It was fortunately not found necessary in London to contemplate the use ol such a bargaining factor, and it may be improbable that any financial inducement will be needed to obtain the Sultan* s signature to the Treaty. It may be relevant, however, to note that the continuance of the subsidy to Sultan Taimur was linked with the question of the Commercial Treaty as mentioned above. (d) The acquisition of increased political control in Muscat, as Powle says, if the subsidy is to be given for this reason a definite undertaking would have to be obtained from the Sultan. Such an undertaking would have to be framed in such a way as not to infringe the Anglo-French declaration of 1862 regarding the independence of Muscat, or alternatively the prior consent of the French Government would have to be secured; in seeking such an undertaking we should also havejM* ioil o -3- to reckon with the Sultan's extrane sensitiveness on the matter of his independent status. The case for granting the subsidy in order to strengthen British influence in Muscat would have been fortified if the Sultan had shown any disposi tion throughout his world tour to seek the friendship of a foreign power in substitution for his present relationship with His Majesty's Government. There was no evidence of such a tendency in the Sultan's conversations in London, and none has come to light in such reports as have hitherto been received on his visits to other countries. 4. The Secretary of State would be glad of the Government of India's views on the above points as well as on the question referred to in paragraph 2 above of the Sultan's claim that he is entitled to the subsidy. 5. I am sending a copy of this letter to Powle. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) R. REEL.Copy. P. 2.29 36/38 Note on the Muscafarma traffic subsidy* . P.2036/11. The * arms traffic subsidy* of Rs.l la^h per annum was given to the Sultan of Muscat (Saiyid Faisal) early in 1912 on the condition that he co-operated in checking the arms traffic in the Persian Gulf by setting up a bonded warehouse for the control of the export of all rifles imported into Muscat. The subsidy was intended as compensation for the loss the Sultan would suffer from the reduction in revenue derived from import duty on imported arms, as submitted to the Secretary of state for approval the grant of the subsidy was to be personal to Saiyid Faisal. (Ten years later it was discovered that there was no evidence that this condition had been communicated to the Sultan). 2. Sultan Saiyid Faisal died on 4th October 1913. In the letter sent to Saiyid Taimur on 14th November, acknowledging his acceptance of his father’s obligations and conveying recognition of his succession, the Political Agent said that the question of the subsidies received by Faisal was being considered separately. The Sultan wrote back expressing surprise and saying he hoped that if he accepted his father’s obligations the allowances paid to his father would be continued to him. On 17th January the Secretary of State authorised payment of the Muscat subsidies (Zanzibar subsidy and arms traffic subsidy) on condition that revision of the 1891 commercial Treaty was postponed for a number of years. Apparently the Sultan accepted the condition. There is nothing in our records to show that it was appreciated at the time that the two subsidies were different in kind, and in particular that the arms traffic subsidy had been intended to be personal to Saiyid Faisal. Both subsidies were treated alike /alike and their renewal to Saiyid Taimur was agreed to as a matter of urgency in consideration of the financial straits in which the new Sultan found himself. 3. In 1921 the Government of India consulted the Political Resident on the question of reducing the arms traffic subsidy. The Political Resident was of opinion that the subsidy was no longer necessary, that it should be maintained during the rule of saiyid Taimur, but that when he ceased to rule it should be stopped. The Government of India submitted a proposal to this effect to the Secretary of state, adding that the circumstances of the two subsidies should be explained to the Sultan in order to avoid the possibility of a misunderstanding in the future. His Majesty's Government approved, when the Political Agent conveyed the decision to the Sultan the latter asked if it was really the case that the grant of the arms traffic subsidy was personal to his father. Examination of Government files failed to show that Saiyid Faisal had been told that the subsidy was personal, and in the circumstances the Political Agent suggested that, in place of a statement that the subsidy would cease when Saiyid Taimur ceased to rule, the Sultan might be told that in that event the matter would be reconsidered and the question of the withdrawal or curtailment of the subsidy treated as one of expediency in the light of the circumstances then existing. The Government of India refused, however, to modify the decision that the subsidy would 'be maintained so long as the present Sultan of Muscat continues to rule but no longer'. This decision was conveyed to the Sultan in writing on 24th February, 1923. The present Sultan succeeded towards the end of 1911 on the abdication of his father. Muscat finances were then in a very critical state. The Government of India proposed in March 1932Sultan it should cease, at any rate under its existing t/ designation* But to present the State from falling into complete financial chaos they proposed to continue the pe yment of Rs.l lakh for a period of 3 years* They added 'We are whether now or on the expiry of this period, is merely a question of expediency and we suggest that it should be made clear to the new Sultan and the State Council that further the next three years the finances of the State must be so organised that it will be able to meet the loss of the subsidy at the close of the period*. The Secretary of State sanction- I I ed the proposals. In 1934 it was felt that the improvement 1 in the finances of Muscat was not enough to justify dis- j continuance of the subsidy and it was decided to extend payment for one more year. The subsidy was accordirgly paid up to the end of 1935, but having regard to the improved state of the Muscat finances it was decided that there was insufficient justification for extending payment beyond the 1st January, (Intld.)

This, however, as .etoalfe points out in his latest letter, is not likely to be of much practical importance, and he appeal's to consider the ,Jultan’s claim to the art,is traffic subsidy as a matter of right to be definitely ruled out by the letters exchanged at the time of his accession.

U.E.CONFIDENTIAL. No. C/198. Political Agency &amp; H.B.M's Consulate^ Muscat, the 25th July 1933 . , From Captain T. Hiekinbotham, O.B.E., Political Agent &amp; H.B.M's Consul, Muscat. To The Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Sir, I have the honour to refer to the ending with your Printed Letter No. 594 -S dated June 23rd 1939. 2. On tne 21 st of July His Highness forwarded a sealed letter to me for onward transmission to His Excellency the Viceroy. I am forwarding this letter to India by the next mail steamer on the 27th of July. I enclose a translation of a copy of His Highness's letter to His Excellency. ^financial position of the State is very difficult to estimate. We are provided with figures quarterly which purport to show receipts and expenditure to date. We have no means of checking these figures as we have no access to the books or treasury accounts. The figures on which recent statements regarding the State's financial position have been based were supplied by Rai Sahib Dull Chand. I have now had an opportunity of meeting Rai Sahib Duli Chand and have closely examined statements made by him. From what I have seen I am very doubtful if any reliance can be placed in the accuracy of any figures or accounts prepared by him or under his super vision. I am very doubtful if the last annual figures dis closed the true financial position of the State. / 4. His2 Highness s political aspirations are absorbing all his interest and all his spare revenue. m fact it is rumoured that he is raising loans locally. No improvements are being undertaken in the town with the exception of the new school building which is slowly taking shape. Sanitation and Public Health are completely neglected. Two of His Highness's relatives are in hospital with enteric fever and the condition of the towns of Muscat and Matrah renders an epidemic not improbable• 5. The money being used in His Highness's political experiments in Oman is that received from Petroleum Concessions Limited with as much as can be taken from State revenues added. If oil does not materialise this source of income will cease to exist. Money is essential for the Sultan's purpose and if he cannot obtain it from us he may look elsewhere. On my advice His Highness recently persuaded the local merchants to import three months reserve of essential food-stuffs in preparedness for any emergency which might arise, The local people are saying that the extra Customs revenue obtained on this consignment enabled His Highness to meet his current monthly expenses. I mention this not because I consider that it is strictly true but because I wish to stress the fact that there are unpleasant rumours about. Little or no reliance can be placed on them but I fear me the same applies to Rai Sahib Duli Chand’s figures. 7 * I am strongly in favour of the restoration of the an- Subsidy in one form or/other even if it is only for a limited period. I do not advocate unconditional restoration. I consider that we should insist (a) on supervision of the finances of the State other / than the- 3 than the present oil revenues as a condition to be agreed to before the Subsidy is re-granted. A skilled and reliable finance officer from Indian Government service should be appointed who will have complete comtrol of revenue and expendi ture. His pay would be the first call on the Subsidy. (b) that major portion of the Subsidy should be ear marked for Public Health and Sanitation. I feel convinced that a skilled} independent xinaneiai. adviser will be able to effect great improvement in the State finances in a reasonably short period of time. 8 Uhfortunately time does not permit me to go into the question in the detail that I should like to nor have I been able to touch on the political aspect. If there is no possibility of the Subsidy being renewed it is a waste of time to consider the details of conditions of restoration but if there is a possibility that the Subsidy might be restored I should like time in which to make suggestions. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant Political Agent &amp; H.B.M’s Consul, Muscat.(17th July^ieag) from e His a H? d &gt; 1 29th o a ' aad auwal 1368 Taimur, Sultan of Muscat Said Mn the Viceroy and SoverSo^e^Tof 0 ^His Excellency After compliments, »e hope that Your Honour is in a proper and complete state of health. Your Honour remembers that when we were kindly permitted to visit you at the capital of India in 1937, spoke to you about the arms compensation, fis. 100 , 000 /- (one hundred thousand), which our Government used to receive from your Government, and which was stopped in 1936 without cause. You Promised to consider the matter. We still thank you for your kind attention when listening to our talk, and your promise to consider the matter, which really has made us hope for success that we may obtain the request. Now one y ear seven months have passed without any information on the subject in spite of our writing a letter some time ago to your ex-Consul at Muscat, requesting him to expedite the matter. You no doubt understand that the compensation referred to above was granted to our Government at the time of our grandfather Sultan Faisal, and was continued during the time of our father Sultan Taimur and remained for four years during our reign, and was stopped, as explained above, without reason or cause. We still respect the arrangements set between your Government and ours in connection with arms traffic. We are sure that you are conversant with the strong and ancient friendship between our and your Gove^ments which has existed for a long time and which still continues in a better and stronger way. ThisThis friendship surely shows that ^ ^ fanow s that you desire the prosperity, advance and inmrovam«r,+ improvement of our Government. e compensation amount (money) was in old days a help to our + . , Government to fulfil a considerable por xon ol its expenses, and which is a great source ^ .P.M »n to . 0 „ , r O carry out some of the necessary improvements which are indispensible to the country and its people. remind Your Honour hbout this matter and repeat our request to you to consider it in » n “ it in a kindly, willingly ” aiir ’ ,1 '' ™ &gt;■». tao» .nd noticed in yon towards o»r aov.m«»t. »s top. that yoo .m accede to what „. stiil hope end request.

Would fou -please refer to your letter of the ^a.st Llarch* No .F. 130( 2)-N/38 ? and connected correspondence regarding the claim of the Sultan of Muscat to the renewal of the Arms Traffic Subsidy. After consultation with the Foreign Office, a copy of whose reply is enclosed, we consider that, if the Sultan revives his claim, a reply should be made to him on the lines of the last sentence of your letter. But as the Sultan has made no fresh reference to the matter in the lengthy period that has elapsed since he raised it in November 1937, and as the only reply we can give at the moment is a negative one, we think, in common with the Foreign Office, that it would be better to make no reply to the Sultan at all unless and until he raises the matter again. If the Government of India are of a like opinion we should be glad if you would inform Fowle accordingly. H.A.F.

Xi Dear Peel, In your letter Wo.P.2.1983/39 of the 23rd May you asked for our views regarding the application made hy the Sultan of Muscat in November 1937 for the renewal, on he groundo both of his right thereto and of the financial needs of his state, of the Arms Traffic Subsidy paid to successive Sultans from 1912 until the end of 1935 . We agree with the view expressed by the Political Resident and the Government of India, which the | India Office share, that there is no case for renewing the subsidy - in view of the sound state of the finances of Muscat and of the unlikelihood of a recrudescence of the conditions under which the subsidy was originally granted - unless the Sultan were in any case l egally entitled to it. 3. We do not, however, consider that the Sultan has any valid claim to the subsidy, since, even if it was not made evident to the Sultan Feisal in 1911 that the subsidy Wo.s personal to him, it is clear that the present Sultan accepted in 1932 the decision that the Arms Traffic Subsidy, as such, should cease. 4/ Teel, Esq. , C.B.E. , M.C. Sit !4. The question of a communication to the Sultan does not really concern us, hut in view of the time that has elapsed since the Sultan's request in November 1937 we feel it might he best to make no reply at all unless and until he should press for one.

Shile it is true that the State is solvent, I do not think that it ban offer any security which would be likely to attract a loan iron any quarter on purely financial grounds, it is just possible that on political and strategical grounds other lowers, Germany, Italy, or Japan, might consider coming to the financial aseista .oe of the Sultan. In view, however, of the Sultan's healthy dislike and suspicion of German and Italian policy I think it extremely unlikely that he would apply for assistance in these directions, nor do I think it likely that he would apply to Japan. Moreover, if he had any such scheme in mind he would I think ilrst inform us, if for no other reason than to influence us to give him assistance instead, se could then consider the situation. 6* 3i nee the reply to the ;iult&amp;a # ® al&amp;lm to the Subsidy will in the negative, -Japtain Hickilab©thaas’a proposals in his para graph 7 wed not be aoneidered* If at any tism the Sultan him- soli* wort to ask Tor a Finance officer fro© the Severn®#nt of India doubtless the latter would be prepared to depute one* Attested * M* T*a.Fowls* Political He side nt in the Persian -Julf* r for Secretary to the Political He side nt in the Persian QttXf *SSSyifflMTl at,.

The secrecy over the transaction is to avoid it being generally known that a call on the money held in the Imperial Bank has had to be made to meet current expenditure 4. The method employed to obtain the money is due in j the first place to the fact that private cables take some time to reach India and there would be considerable delay before a bank remittance could arrive, and secondly to the fact that His Highness's credit is so poor locally that a loan, even if forthcoming, would only be made at a very high rate of interest. 5.

The latter subsidy is referred to as initially having been granted to Sultan Faisal bin Turki [Fayṣal bin Turkī Āl Bū Sa‘īd] as a personal subsidy in 1912, in recognition of his co-operation in the suppression of arms traffic in the Persian Gulf. The Zanzibar subsidy is described as being the right of any Sultan recognised by the British Government, 'subject to their fulfilling certain conditions.'The date range of the volume is 1921-1939; however, there is no material dating from 1924-1931. The correspondence dating from 1921 to 1923 (ff 2-40) notes the continuation of the arms traffic subsidy following the death of Sultan Faisal bin Turki, owing to certain exceptional circumstances, and discusses whether it should be reduced or withdrawn when his successor, Sultan Taimur bin Faisal [Taymūr bin Fayṣal bin Turkī Āl Bū Sa‘īd] ceases to rule. The question is raised again in 1932, following the abdication of Sultan Taimur bin Faisal and the accession of his son, Saiyid Said bin Taimur [Sa‘īd bin Taymūr Āl Bū Sa‘īd], and this later correspondence discusses the extension of the subsidy and its eventual discontinuation in January 1936. Also discussed are changes to the arrangements for the payment of the Zanzibar subsidy.The volume features the following principal correspondents: the Political Agent and Consul, Muscat; the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; the Government of India's Foreign Secretary; the Viceroy of India; the Sultan of Muscat and Oman; officials of the India Office and the Government of India's Foreign and Political Department.The Arabic language material mostly consists of correspondence exchanged between British representatives and the Sultan of Muscat, of which English translations are also present.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Foreign and Political Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indian Political Service, External Affairs Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Foreign Secretary</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Viceroy and Governor-General of India in Council</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent; subject</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman Fayṣal bin Turkī Āl Bū Sa'īd</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman Āl Wasik Billah al-Majid Taymūr bin Fayṣal bin Turkī Āl Sa'īd</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman Sa'īd ibn Taymūr Āl Bū Sa'īd</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Sultanate of Muscat and Oman</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Finance</topic></subject><subject><topic>Subsidies</topic></subject><subject><topic>Arms traffic</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000383#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
