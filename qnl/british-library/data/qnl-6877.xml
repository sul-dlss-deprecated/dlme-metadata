(Baghdad Telegrams Kos. 7725, 8031, and 8075, dated loth, 25th and 27th September 1918 ; Viceroy's Telegram of tith Octoher 1918.) ^ote by Political Department, India Office. 1. 1 lie Secretary of State's telegram of the ^9th March 1917, which was fraiued under the directions of a Committee of the War Cabinet shortly after the British occupation of Baghdad, laid down in some detail the principles which His Majesty's Government, as then advised, proposed to appl}'' to the future administration of the occupied territory. The following clear differentiation was made between the status of the Basra Vilayet and that of the Baghdad Vilayet : — (1) Basra was ' to remain permanently under Britisli administration,' its western and northern limits being specifically defined. (2) Baghdad was to be ' an Arab State with a local ruler cr Government under British protectorate in everything but name.' Behind its 'Arab facade' tho vilayet was to be 'administered as an Arab province by ' indigenous agency and in accordance with existing laws and institutions ' as far as possible' ; and stress was laid on the importance of making all administrative arrangements introduced into the vilayet conform strictly from the very outset with the principles enunciated by His Majesty's Government. 2. In other words, our original policy was (1) to annex Basra, and (2) to set up in Baghdad an Arab State under British protection and supervision. The importance of differentiating bat ween the two vilayets was again emphasised by the Secretary of State on the 10th May 1917, when, in a telegram replying to the criticisms of Sir P. Cox and the Government of India on the proposals of His Majesty's Government, he laid it down that ' nothing that can be avoided should be done during military ' occupation that would prejudice subsequent introduction of above-mentioned ' principles, and in particular estahlishment of separate administrative sustems for 'Basra and Baghdad.' This policy held the field for a considerable time; and, though it is understood that the annexation of Basra is no longer regarded as a practicable measure, the principle of differentiation between the two vilayets has never been formally abandoned. 3. It was originally proposed, at Sir P. Cox's suggestion, that a Commission from England should visit Mesopotamia during the cold weather of 1917-18 to examine the whole administrative problem on the spot, and submit detailed recommendations for the approval of His Majesty's Government. Owing to circumstances connected with the then military situation it was not found practicable to carry this project into execution, and it has remained in abeyance ever since, until revived by Captain Wilson in his telegram of the 27tli September 1918. In the early part of the present year Sir P. Cox was summoned to England to discuss the whole question of the future of Mesopotamia with His Majesty's Government. While in England Sir P. Cox embodied his views and recommendations in a-memorandum which was submitted to the Eastern Committee, and which, after personal discussion with the writer, received their full approval. This document, which has been forwarded to the Government of India by formal despatch for the information and guidance of the political autho rities at Baghdad, may presumably be regarded as the authorised statement of the Mesopotamian policy of His Majesty's Government. 4. Sir P. Cox started with the assumption that ' if at the end of the war we find ' ourselves in a suHiciently strong position, and in effective administrative control, ' we should still hope to annex the Basra Vilayet and exercise a veiled protectorate ' over the Baghdad Vilayet.' In a subsequent paragraph he wrote: — . 'Alluding for the moment to the question of relative status as between the Basra and Baghdad Vilayets respectively, it is my very definite opinion that s 21 40 10;i8o a hoinoo-eneons adminiBtration in all practical aspects is not in any way 'incomp .-Ttible with a technical difference of political status, and that it is r&lt;*cntial in the interest* of the country that the administration of both vilaijets should he uniform, that of the Basra Vilayet being brought into line with Basra in due course.' - i n v i ew 0 f the above passage, Captain Wilson seems to be justified in claiming ft le^rani Xo 77-0 of loth September) that his decision to combine the administration of the* t.vo vilayets under a single headquarters office at Baghdad is ' in conformity with the .venoral instructions given by the Eastern Committee ' to Sir P. Cox, provided it is understood that, where differences of sytem exist, Basra methods must )„&gt; assimilated to those of Baghdad, and not vice versa. There is force in the Civil Commissiorier's contention that the ' maintenance of an artificial distinction, where ' in reolitij none exists} would necessarily involve some lack of co-ordination.' That the distinction is a purely artificial one was pointed out by Sir P. Cox as long ago as the 7th April 1917. He then telegraphed ' f irA convinced . . . that no attempt to differentiate fundamentally in regard to working principles and details of the two administrations will produce satisfactory results, and that they should be so similar as to be indistinguishable in the working. The difference would be one of technical political status and nomenclature which need not make itself felt on the spot. To attempt to run the two vilayets, nhich are from every point of view insejiarahlc, on conflicting lines and inconsistent pimciples would, I am sure, result in great prejudice to all interests concerned.' Up to a comparatively recent period there was this practical point ol difference between the two vilayets, that Baghdad was still a. war area, whereas Basra was beino- administered under what were, to all intents and purposes, peace conditions. To-day, as Captain Wilson intimates, this distinction hr.s largely disappeared; and recent events have rendered its reappearance in the highest degree improbable. There remains the question of the post-war settlement. Will the ultimate differentiation of status between the two vilayets—supposing tins lorms part of the settlement—be prejudiced by uniiorm administration during me pei lod of military occupation? In 1917 it was iearcd that this might be ilio ease. Bat Sir P. Cox, speaking from more than a year's experience of the actual administration of the two'vilayets, is evidently of opinion that the fear was groundless. His views having been generally adopted by His Majesty s Ciovernment, we need not c.txi at ^ u steps taken, primarily on grounds of administrative convenience, to cam them into effect. G. Captain Wilson has revived the question oi a Commission jrom Ijnyland at what seems to the Department a rather opportune moment. Last year the proposal Avas dropped because of the likelihood, as it then appeared, that serious militai} . operations would take place during the winter season. No swell likelihood exists now. Moreover, the prospect of peace discussions has been brought within measurame distance by the events of the last few weeks. We may find ourselves, much sooner t han Ave expected,called upon to argue and justify our Mesopotamian case. W e shall plain!) be in a position to do so with much greater effect if we have a considered and coherent policy to place before the world. It is true that the Ciovernment ol India (who have criticised adversely several of Captain Wilson's recent recommendations) rcgaid the proposal as ' altogether premature,' and consider that 'no useful purpose would be served by the despatch of a Commission at the present stage. But then criticism appears to be directed rather against the choice of subjects lor investigation b} the i ommission than against the principle of the Commission itself. W hat seems to be required is, jiot to tie down the Commission to particular lines ol enquiry, but to give them a free hand to examine and report, in consultation with the local aut lonties, on the wider aspects of administrative policy in the occupied territories, e want to fonu a clearer idea in our own minds as to the main lines on which we 10 rV- a c l ear ' cll t programme will not only hamper us at the ()U 5 nrm ' e i lt already hampering us in regard to a numbei s ol practical recemlv^ulmUt^ 1 )^!'

Tn all these matters, the importance of which cannot be disregarded, the uncertainty of the future makes it very difficult to take any decided line. The Department, it need hardly be said, has no desire to place the Government of India at a disadvantage in regard to ' questions vitally affecting Indian interests.' But the Government of India will be directly represented on the proposed Commission; and it would perhaps meet the case if their representative were given a discretion to remove from the scope of the enquiry, or at any rate to reserve for subsequent reference to his Government, any points on which the interests of India were directly concerned. 7. Composition of the Commission. —As already indicated, the Department supports Captain Wilson s suggestion that one member of the Commission should be nominated by the Government of India. Perhaps the Egyptian Administration might be asked to nominate another, leaving the Chairman and Secretary to be appointed by His Majesty's Government. A representative of the General Oflicer Commanding, Baghdad, could be added after the arrival of the Commission in Mesopotamia. The proposal that an officer on the spot should be deputed to clear the ground in advance seems a very good one, as also the suggestion that the Commission should be empowered, at its discretion, to co-opt heads of local administrative Departments. It is submitted that, as a first step, the proposed Commission should be approved in principle. Details of its composition, terms of reference, &amp;c., will then be taken up without delay. 8. It may be added that this note is concerned only with the points immediately at issue, viz. :—(1) the amalgamation for practical purposes of the administrative systems of the Basra and Baghdad Vilayets; and (2) the appointment of a Commission from England to study further administrative problems on the spot. It is not desired to raise in this connection the wider questions of international policy, tS:c., which will have to be taken into account when the future of Mesopotamia is ultimately settled. It is enough to say that the measures now under consideration will not in any way prejudice these wider issues, though they may serve to strengthen the hands of His Majesty's Government in dealing with them. 9. It is accordingly recommended— (1) that Captain Wilson be informed that the steps taken by him to amalgamate the Basra and Baghdad administrative systems as reported in his telegram No. 7725, are approved, with the proviso that, in harmonising the two - systems, his guiding principle should be to bring the Basra system into line with that of Baghdad, and not vice versa ; (w) that the proposal to send a small Commission from England to Mesopotamia during the present autumn to examine administrative problems on the spot, and make detailed recommendations to His Majesty's Government, be approved in principle, subject to the reservation of the rights of the Government of India in regard to questions affecting Indian interests, and that the Government of India and the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, be informed accordingly ; and (3) that, pending the appointment and arrival of this Commission, Captain Wilson be authorised to place an ollicer on special duty in Mesopotamia to make preliminary arrangements for the Commissioners investigations. 1 ) OLITIGATi D k PAUTMENT, I ndia O fficf, 21st October 1918.
