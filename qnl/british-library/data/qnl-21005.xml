Anglo- — - 4 Persian Oil Company to obtain exclusive prospecting rights on the Arabian littoral of the Persian Gulf. You should take no action until you receive further instructions from ■ me. in July of last jrear His Excellency the High Commission er, Iraq and I were informed by His Majesty's Government that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company were desirous of obtaining exclusive prospecting rights in Arabia and on the Persian Gulf littoral for oil and its allied products, viz bitumen, pitch, ozokerite etc, ^nd in reply to a request for my views as to the feasibility of obtaining such rights from the various Sheikhs I stated that I considered that in view of the conventions of 27th October 1913 ctnd 14th May 1914, which we made with the Sheikhs of Kuwait and Bahrain respectively, there was no objection to negotiations being opened with these two Sheikhs at once, and His Excellency the High Commissioner, Baghdad had ^ already expressed his views in the sci,me sense. And as regards the Trucial Coast I recommended that it wouxd not be pdviaable just at present to go further thanthan obtain a convention similar to thoBe made with/ 7 | Kuwait and Bahrain. His Excellency the High Commissioner does not consider the moment opportune for raising the question of an oil agreement with Bin Saud and has recommended accordingly.

SD/- A.T.WILSON RESIDENT DIRECTOR.To His Excellency, The High Connissioner B A G K D A D # Dated 22nd December 1921 i have the honour to state that I have 'been instructed, by the Board of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company Limited to open negotiations with the Sheikhs of Bahrain and Kuwait with a view to concluding Agreements with thein in oornoo~ tion with Oil in their territories* S« As you arc no^ doubt aware, it was provided under the arrangements concluded in 1914 for a fusion of interests in regard to Turkey of the D'Aroy Exploration Company ard of the Turkish Petroleum Company that none of the partici pants would interest themselves in concessions anywhere in the Ottoman Empire otherwise than through the Turkish Petroleum Company. 3# The Clause in question reads as follows:- M 10« The three groups participating in the Turkish 'Petroleum Company shall give undertakings on their ^own behalf and on behalf of the Companies associated with them not to be interested directly or indirect^ H in the production or manufacture of Crude Oil in the fOttoman Empire in Rurope or Asia, except in that ' i part which is under the administration of the Egypt-I 'ian Government or of the Sheikh of Kuwait or in the Transferred territories M on the Turko-Persian Fron tier, otherwise than through the Turkish Petroleum * Company'. 4, You will note that the territories of the Sheikh of Kuwait are specifically encluded. 5. The Board do not consider it necessary at this stage to incur the considerable expense involved in registering a new Subsidiary Company, and propose that negotiations should be conducted on behalf of the D'Apcy Exploration Company.! trust that this course will have your concurrence.6• I enclose a draft of the Concesoion which I propose to negotiate with the Sheilih of Kuwait, if and when I have your authority to do so'} for which sruthority I now ireg to apply. 7, Ao regards Article 10 of the draft, in view of the txsi fact that the BaMitiari Khans are tav-ing such ctrong excent-i tion to the deduction of Income Tax on dividends to which they are entitled, the OOLip-my vrould prefer to a sh:, re interest and arrangement under which an annual paynent enuivalent to lOJ? cf the net profits, after providing for depreciation etc, should 'be paid to the Sheikh. In this connection rarerence is Invited to the terms on which the A .r .0.0. holds its concesnion frc^ tli . Persian aovernnentj viz: 16ft of nett profits. It is consideree 'by the Poard that not raoro than 1C$ wou^d 'bo Justified in the case of Kuwait and Bahrain in view of the somewhat srsrirar unproniaing prospects of finding 11 t either pl^ce, ■n6 the very heavj capital expenditure involved, and of the purely nominal assistance in regard to protection required from the Chiefs at either pi c r - practically no pipe line would !&gt;• needed for example if Oil were found. 8. I have no Official information as to whether Kuwait is at present for purposes of Political Administration under Baghdad or Bushire^ and only venture to address you on the subject as the result of an informal conversation with the Political Agent. As however T have also to negotiate with Bahrain, and I as I would propose to do so (subject to the approval of the Political Resident) immediately after the completion of negotiations with Kuwait, I venture to ask that Lt-Col. Trevor may be authorised 'by you to accompany me to Kuwait m R.l.r .S.^Lawrence 1 * to assist me on your behalf in these negotiationst without your or his presence the Sheikh might&lt; on view of his engagements on the subject with CrOvernment, \vt* Govsrment, not fool justified in negotiating. 0.

He has also addressed me asking to 'bo allowed to take similar action in Bahrain. I have not yet received any instructions from Government that negotiations should be opened but in any case I think it would best for preliminaries to be under taken by the respective political Agents. I do not know present Sheikh of Kuwait but I doubt if he would be pre pared to sign an agreement of the sort straight off when presented to him by sir A.Wilson and myself, and I am quite sure the Sheikh of Bahrain would not. Latter would certainly renuire a lot of talking to first and probably former would too.

Yours sincerelyy CNF 1D.ENT l-aL . The Residency My dear Daly , I have Just received yout telegram No. 78 -G dated loth June on the subject of oil concessions , Bahrain. 1 am endeavouring to get a letter myself to Shaikh Hamad on this subject. I learn from Kuwait that Holmes is leaving for England by this slow mail and there will probably be considerable developments when he gets back to Europe and the Eastern and General Syndicate discover what a tangle they and Holmes have tied themselves up in. a. T . Wilson may or may not be correct when he says that it is quite impossible for the Eastern and General Syndic ate to work the concession which they have obtained from Bin Saud without the aid of the Anglo Persian Oil Company. If he is right 1 do not see what possible benefit to Bin Saud or any body else there can result from these negotiations . All this renders it imperative that Bahrain should be extremely cautious before committing themselves in any direction. In my original draft I directed Hamad to inform Holmes that the concession was valueless as His Majesty's Government would not consent to it and there is not the least doubt that Holmes knew perfectly well, and so did his principals , that their proper path lay through the Colonial Department of His Majesty's Government and they can have no reasonable ground of complaint whatever if they find that His Majesty's Servants are up against them. Of course I cannot explain on my present information the conduct of Sir Percy Cox. He is big enough to defend himself and it seems obvious that he must have had sources of information which are not available to me. But then, on this supposition, 1 am entirely at a loss to explain why the Secretary of State for the Colonies has let Cox down. In regard to Bahrain the position is absolutely clear, as 1 am explaining in my letter . Shey have promised not Jso entere nter irrto negot»ia'tiona with any person not approved by His Majesty's Ctovemment and they had no right to make any assumpt ion irom what took place at Riyadh that the same person the would be approved in Bahrain. You can also tell Hamad that there are excellent reasons which you are not allowed to disclose at present why Holmes and the Eastern and General Syndicate do not suit Bahrain. No one wants to force Bahrain into parting with its oil to the Anglo Persian Oil Com pany or anybody else , but there is a most dangercus proposal in Hamad^s letter , as reported by you in the telegram under consideration , viz, , that Government will allow him to deal with some other English company . If that means that Hamad is to rush into the market and entangle himself with any rascally speculator who may present himself, l can conceive no course of conduct that could be more distasteful to the British Gov ernment or more dangerous to himself. The oil will not run away and the concession is cjuite likely to be a more valuable matter to the Shaikhs five years hence, say, than it is now. Why hurry ? Yours sincerely , ■ r * You might ask Hamad how does he know that the con cession granted by Bin Saud is not objected to by His Majesty's C-overmnent. ? They would not be likely to tell hip so if it was ana even Sir Percy Cox may make mistakes. 3?o Major O .K. Daly , Political Agent, BahrainI J Ko.^-s ot ^.

Sir, 1 have the honour to ad ress you on the subject of oil concessions in the Bahrain islands and at the same tinie to enclose original and a co^y ol a letter addressed by me to Shaikh Hamad bin laa,. The original should be handed over to the addressee and the copy retained by you for record in your archives , 2 . The instructions contained in the telegram aiifc cited above have no doubt been acted on by you ere this but. in view of the opinion expressed by Mr, Mackie , representative of the Anglo ersian Gil Company in Bahrain, in correspondence with Sir Arnold Wilson that any intervention by you in their favour is likely, in view of the present opinion held by the Shaikhs (vide paragraph P of your telegram No, 7c- C dated 1st June 1^23 to my address) to hamper, rather than forward, the Anglo Persian Gil Company negotiations with the Shaikhs, you may have found it difficult to 'give Mackie such assistance as he may properly ask from you by tasing your influence with Shaikh Hamad' . This clause in your instructions will now be held in abeyance and you will only render such assistance when the Anpfco Persian oil Company require it and will not press your assistance on them nor discuss the matter farther with Shaikh JIamadNo . f6Oj of 1923 . British Residency and Consulate-General ^ f ■/ Bus hire , 12the June 1^3. To Sliaikh Hamad , fully empowered Agent of 'the Shaikh of Bahrain A.G. My dear friend , 1 find myself oblip-ed to write to you what I have already informed you verbally that, as at present advised , I see no possibility of the British Government approving the concession you have given to Major Holmes , the representative of the Eastern and General Syndicate, and must further request you to inform that gentleman in writing that you already con sider that agreement void and of no effect, since you have received an ofiicial intimation from the representative of His Majesty's Government in these waters that it is not approved , 1 must further point out to you, 0 my friend, that your respected lather , Shaikh Isa , was not acting in accordance with the promise given by him to Major Trevor on the 18th Jamadi 11 , 133^ when he concluded even a provisional agreement or granted a provisional concession to Major Holmes, The wording of that letter is very strong ,'1 will not entertain overtures from any quarter regarding kerosine oil without corjsulting the Political Agent in Bahrain and without the approval of the High Government', When your respected father discussed the question with Major Holmes and gave him a written concession, hedged about no matter with what conditions he broke his promise to the High Government, It is no excuse to say that , as Major Holmes hauconcluded an agreement with His Highness the Sultan of Nejd , you therefore assumed that Major Holmes was a person acceptable to the British Government. Whatmay not suit them in regard to Bahrain and in any case it was necessary for you to mane sure belore ent^anglin^ yourself with Major Holmes. 1 trust that this letter will impose caution on yourself for the future and shall Iook forward to receiving, in due course , a copy of your written communication to Major Holmes regarding which you should , before despatch, consult the political Agent, Bahrain.

Subsequent modifications have not yet been received and 1 am awaiting a visit from Sir Arnold Wilson before taking any further definite action in Bahrain. 1 also hesitate to approach Shaikh of Kuwait before consulting Sir Arnold Wilson as it is highly probable that Shaikh of Mohaminerah may at this moment be persuading Shaikh of Kuwait to come to an agreement with D'Arcy Explor ation Company .

Let us look at the facts tog ether , your father promised he would not enter into negotiations regarding oil conc©ssions wi'th any- on© not approv©d by th© British Government» And h© has broken that promise and you and your brother Abdul la inf ormec me confidentially that you were concerned in the negotiations , and were therefore equally guilty in breaking the Bahrain promise in company with your respected father * No doubt this was done inadvertently but the fact remains that the promise was 'broken. I now ask you as an honest man to maRe th© only reparation in your power and to inform Major Holmes that you regret that owing t 0 a previous promise m ade to the British Government, which, for the moment } you forgot 9 you must ask him to consider all these negotiations null and void . If you like to add that there was no fault on the p art\ / \ / paxt of Major Holmes ? that is yom: affair, Or^o^se l do not agree that there was no fault on the part of Major Holmes for if he had d^e what prudence w ould have advised any ordinary contractor to do vi . to consult the Political Agent, Bahrain, who is entrusted with the affairs of British subjects in Bahrain, he would have learned immediately that the Shaikh of Bahrfelm was unable to treat on the subject of oil with any person not approved by His Majesty's Government. And Major Holmes knew perfectly well that he was n ot so approved , Therefore the whole of these negotiations was underhand and deceitful and all parties concerned m ust share the blame» I think on reconsideration your Highness will agree that the part of an honest man 9 now that the facts are pointed out to him and that no concealment is longer possible is to inform Major Holmes in the sense that 1 have desired ^ Whether you do so or not is largely a matter of indifference except so fa^l as your own reputation anu credit with His Majesty's Government is concerned. If you value that respect and credit you will do as I ^ivise 4 ; if you do not, 1 can only regret the inference which His Majesty's Gov ernment and their officers must d^aw from your conduct.

J m posting a copy of th if di lect to L x aly but it0 0 P Y« Dovming Street, No* 9* 6th September i Sir, I have the honour bo acknowledge the receipt of ' your despatch of the 20th June, Ho* 299, transmitting the text of a draft Agreement submitted to the Sheikh of Kuwait by Sir Arnold Wilson on behalf of the D'Arcy Exploration Company and your despatches ! T o» 378 and 405 of the 13th and 24th of July on the same subject# Before' commenting upon the draft provisions of thiB/Agreement, T desire to explain in some detail the attitude of His Majesty^ Government towards this Concession and towards the question of the grant of Oil Concessions on the Arabian Littoral of the Persian Gulf in general• For this purpose it will be convenient to review briefly the circumstances which have led up to the present situation, in this despatch I do not propose to deal with the question of the Nejd Concession, since this ill torm ..he subject of a separate despatch* 2, As you are aware. His Majesty's G-overnment as part ' of a considered policy have obtained from the Sheikhs of Kuwait and Bahrain and from other native rulers in the Persian Gulf, formal undertakings to the effect that they will not grant any concessions for the development of Oil in their territories to any person, or persons, not approved ('appointed' ) fey His Majesty's Government. The object of obtaining G RESIDENT THE PERSIAN GULF.( .1 ^ I ' OBTAining these undertakings was two-fold, in the place it was intended thereby to protect the rulers themselves against the pernicious activities of unscrupulous Concession huntexs of the type which preyed so successfully upon the Turkish Empire before the war, and secondly it was desired by this meanG to restrict the grant of Concessions to reputable British -inns, ^.nd thus to prevent the infiltration of foreign incluence in he Persian Gulf, which was regarded as politically undesirable. x ~ n order to avoid advantage being taken of the native rulers* inexperience in such matters, it was laid down that applicants for Concessions should not negotiate direct with the Sheildis, but should, in the first instance seek His Majesty ! s Government's permission to apply for a Concession upon approved lines, and, having obtained such permission and agreed upon terms which His Majesty's Government would be prepared to recommend to the Sheikhs as acceptable, should then op^n negotiations either through the Political Resident or through the medium of the Political Agent concerned. 4. in the summer of 1921 the Anglo-Persian Oil Company expressed a desire to secure a series of exclusive prospecting licenses for Oil over the whole Arabian Littoral of the Persian Gulf. The Company's proposal was referred to this Department by the India Office and, as my predecessor was satisfied that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company were in a position to undertake and carry out satisfactorily the development of the oil resources of that area, the proposal was accepted in principle. After considerable correspondence and negotiation the main heads of an Agreement covering exploratory and prospecting rights in the territories of Bahrain and Kuwait were drawn up in agreement with the Compcmy by the interested Department of His Majesty's Government, and/ «% /7? Ur and were cooinnnicated to the Political Resident for submission to the Sheikhs concerned• These draft heads of Agreement, which were Adapted from the usual Colonial ''odel, were so framed as to provide the nucleus of an Agreement, ¥/hich would, in my opinion, have 'been in every way favourable to the interests of the Sheikhs, in that they were designed * not only to provide for the expeditious and systematic development of the oil resources of their territories, hut also to produce for the Sheikhs very handsome royalties* 5• However, before any agreement could be concluded Major Holmes, avowedly, and probably actually, in ignorance of the necessity for obtaining the prior permission of His Majesty 's Government, approached the Sheikhs of Kuwait and Bahrain direct and succeeded in inducing them to grant or undertake to grant to the Eastern and General Syndicate, which he represented, exclusive Concessions for the exploitation of oil and other minerals in their territories. 6. These concessions contain several unsatisfactory features (notably the provision whereby the Sheikha would receive a percentage of the shares of the exploitation Company, in the place of a definite royalty based upon output) and they would in any case require to be sub star tially modified before T should feel justified in advising the Sheikhs to accept them* But quite apart from this consideration, I felt very strongly that the Sheikhs should not be allowed to disregard their solemn undertakings with impunity, nor that unapproved. T firms, oy approaching them direct, should be permitted to secure Concessions the terms of which had not previously been submitted oo His '.iajesty s Government; particularly in view of the fact bhat the Anglo- *Anglo -Persian Oil Company ivould thereby have directly suffered as a result of having carefully observed all the conditions required by His i:ajesty 1 s Government# A telegram was therefore sent to Colonel Trevor on the 50th June instructing him to inform the Sheikhs that His Majesty^ Government would not approve of the Concessions which contrary to their undertakings they had granted to Major Holmes, and that the Eastern and General Syndicate was not a firm approved by His Majesty's Government* 7, By this latter statement it must not be understood that my intention was to ^ive the impression that His Ma jesty 's Government had apy objection in principle to he Eastern and General Syndicate except on the grounds o^ the irregular mariner in which their Concessions had been obtained- On the contrary, so far as His Majesty 's Government are aware the Eastern and General Syndicate although possessing i-Gitner the wide experience of oil production nor the efficient organization and financial strength of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company are a substantial and ropuoable * 0. In view of the attitude taken up by His Majesty's Government the Eastern an.d General' Syndicate have now volunteered to modify their Concessions in such manner as to Conform to the wishes of His Majesty's Government. These Concessions have not yet been closely examined in the Colonial Office but if \n fact the syndicate ^how themselves willing to accept such suggested modifications as may upon examination prove to th necessary, anr moreover areare able to satisfy me that they are in a position and intend to carry out to the full the obligations which they propose to undertake towards the Sheikhs, I shall no longer, subject to my remarks in the following paragraph, feel any strong objection to their candidature• g. On the other hand, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company both by their priority of application and by ✓ their due observance of the correct procedure, have in my opinion established an undoubted claim to His Majesty's Government's prior support, provided, of course, that they are prepared to offer to the Sheikhs terms at least as favourable as those submitted by the Eastern and General Syndicate# Oonsequently I am not prepared to recognize the Concessions granted to the latter- Company unless and until the Sheikh of Kuwait has set forth his objections to the draft Agreement submitted to him by Sir Arnold Wilson! has explained his statement (reported in the telegram of the loth July from the Political Agent, Kuwait, a copy of which accompanied your despatch o^ the bObh July No. 378) that the draft Agreement is entirely unacceptable to himself and his people; has satisfied me of the validity of those objections: and has further stated precisely in what manner he wishes that Agreement modified. 10, If when this information 1fu has been obtained from/sheikh, his proposals are M • '.i 4&lt; 8 ■WC^y v not accepted 'by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company I shall \ then oe ppepax^ed. to approve of the Kuwait Concession 'being granted to the Eastern and General Syndicate, provided that the terms thereof are no more favourable to the Company than those rejected by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, and that the Concession is. recast 'upon approved lines* 11• You should therefore communicate to the Sheikh the revised draft agreement contained in the later paragraphs of this despatch and inform him that His Majesty's Government consider it a fair basis for discussion with the Company* You should also call upon him to formulate his objections if any to this revised draft Agreement, and to state in the clearest terms in what way ^e proposes that it should be modified* The Sheikhas proposals should then be communicated to me and also to the local representative of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, who would then decide, in consultation with his principals, to what extenfi these proposals may be accepted* I am also prepared,provided the alterations proposed do not involve any large question of principle, and provided that they are acceptable to the Company to authorize you at your own discretion to approve on behalf of His Majesty's Government the grant of the cojicession by the Sheikh without farther reference to myself. In dealing with this matter you should proceed in consultation with the local representatives of the Company as proposed in the last paragraph of your despatch ' T o. 405 ofin a i of the 24th of July# 12• The procedure which I have set out above as regards Kuwait, should also be followed, mutatis mutandis with regard to Bahrain. You should proceed as you propose in your despatch No# 406 of the 24th of July and, when you think that the time is ripe for further action, the sheikh should be informed that His Majesty's Government have not found it possible, in view of the prior claims of the jj'Arcy Exploration Company, to approve the concession granted by the Sheikh, contrary to his predecessor's solemn undertaking, to the Eastern and General Syndicate, and that they desire him first of all to consider the application of the former Company# In the event however of the Company not being prepared to offer the Sheikh terms which are as favourable in the opinion of the Sheikh himself and of His Majesty^ Government as those offered by the Syndicate, His Majesty 's Government are ppepafced to withdraw their opposition to the grant of a concession to the latter# 13• i will now proceed to examine the Anglo- Persian Oil Company's draft agreement, the form of which in my opinion, leaves much to be desired. I fully sympathise with the Company's desire to regularize their position once and for all, which has led them to provide in one agreement.for the grant of exploration and prospecting licenses and a mining lease, but their draft has in consequence lost in precision and clarity, and appears to change the Sheikh with large and ill-defined liabilities over a long period of years. This is illustrated by the wording of Article 1, which at present gives the impression th,at I 11 s f. i ' ; ' i 1 ml f i thethe exploration license is to remain inforce for a period of 60 years* This is presumably not the intention, and in any oase directly conflicts with Article 2# T should therefore not find it possible to inform the Sheikh that I am satisfied that his rights and interests would be adequately guarded by the existing draft i agreement• The Company can, however, attain their object equally well,, and without imparting ambiguity into the agreement, by adopting the expedient of framing an agree ment v/hich provides for the grant of exploration and pros pecting rights, and also irrevocably binds the SheiKh - subject to the fulfilment of certain specified conditions - to grant at the request of the Company (on or before the termination of the prospecting period) a mining lease upon terms set forth in detail in a document scheduled to the agreement. The advantage of this method, which is generally &amp; g employed in similar cases in the Colonies, is that it def?aie • without ambiguity the exact relations between the two part ies in all the various stages; moreover it is by this xgrsx. arrangement open to the Company at the expiry of the pros pecting period either to withdraw from the whole undertaking with incurring any obligations in respect of exploitation, or, if oil is discovered in profitable Quantities, to obtain a mining lease upon previously agreed temn• 14# T his view should be represented to the Local Representative of the Company, and he should he pressed to substitute for.tne present draft agreement a revised draft modified on the following lines# He should he infomed that if the Agreement is revisedmm# ■■ revised in this way I shall have no hesitation iH commending it to the SheiMi# Arti.ci e T # should read;- 11 The Sheikh grants to . the Company 'by these Dresents an exclusive exploratioxi license for a period of two years from the date of this agreement, whereby the Company shall be entitled to search for natural gas, petroleum, asphalte and ozocerite throughout the whole extent of the territories under his control and to enjoy the privileges set out in this first schedule to this agree ment; and he undertakes on behalf of himself and his successor's to grant to the Company the further exclusive licences and privileges set forth below* Ar 1 '!^' f*! b TT The Exploration licence referred v ; ■ to in the preceding Article may be extended for a farther period of two years and so on as in the existing Artidle II« 'Article III The sheikh hereby undertakes on behalf of himself ^ and successors to grant to the Company on application after the expiry of the above mentioned period •••*•»• and so on as in exx^ Ar oi'-'ie III* Add at the end!- 'Under the terras of this licence the Company shall enjoy the privileges set out in the second schedule to this agreejuonb • Article IV* The sbeikh hereby undertakes on behalf of himself and his successors to grant to the Company on the expiration of the prospecting licence a Mining Lease over an aggregate area not exceeding 100,000 aorea divided'into not more than three blocks on the terms and,in the form of the Lease attached as the third schedule to this Agreement.* ^ ) * Avti cle V*Article V* First sentenoe as first sentence of Article XIV* Delete 2nd sentence of the latter article and substituto 'They shall not be liable to pay any further sum to the SheiKh unless they receive a Mining Lease from him, but if they receive such a mining lease they shall pay to him the sums provided in the lease but no more* Article VI* Present Article XV* i Article VII* Present Article XVI* Article VIII•Present Article XVII* Privileges to be enjoyed by the Company under the Exploration Licence* 1.

Trevor, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, No. 218 -S. of 1921, dated B ushire, the 8 th (received 20 th) September 1921. Subject:— Anglo-Persian Oil Company's desire to obtain concessions to prospect for oil on the Arabian littoral of the Persian Gulf. 1 have the honour to refer to the correspondence between the Colonial Office and the India Office regarding the desire of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to obtain concessions for oil in certain Arabian territories on the Persian Gulf Littoral, copies of which were sent to the Foreign and Poli tical Department and to me (with Mr. Wakely's letter No. P.-2794, dated 30th June 1921). 2 I waited to reply to this as I expected some communication from the Government of India, but as considerable time has elapsed, and His Excellency the High Commissioner in Mesopotamia has already communi cated his views in his letter No. 8 D -1928, dated the 10th August (a copy of which is annexed in case it has not already been sent to the Government of India), I think it advisable to submit my views without further delay- 3. As regards Kuwait and Bahrain I agree with His Excellency the Hi^h Commissioner that, in view of the Conventions of 27th October 1913 and 14th May 1914, which we have made with the respective Sheikhs there is no obiection to negotiations being opened at once., I also concur with His Excellency that the style ' Anglo-Persian Oil Company - is undesirable for a Company obtaining a concession m Bahrain and that it would be advisable to form a subsidiary company to be styled Ihe Arab Coast Oil Company or 'The Arabian Oil Company . I presume the same Company would prospect all down the Arabian Littoral and Oman, so perhaps it might be styled ' The Eastern Arabian Oil Company ', unless operating all over Arabia m which case 1 Arabian Oil Company '', or ' The Anglo-Arabian Od Company would he better. i. As regards Muscat, the present Council of amenable and I think that if they were sounded by the Pohtical Agent on the subiect 'we should find that no objection would be likely and that this point, p nn at I would observe that the Sheikhs a stysr# s.tSfs&amp;s: a -- -- -&gt;— mined opposition in all the Snei o{ these Sheikhs to endeavour I think it would be best r tioils similar to those made with in the first instance, to o -tarn o COI1C ession if the Anglo-Persian Kuwait and Bahrain, and la cr on y ne - g j 1 ] [)0ur i n g countries, thought Oil Company, after prospecting T • i Coast.

With reference to the correspondence ending with your telegram, o. 2374-8., dated 11th October 1921 on the subject of the desire of the jiglo-Persian Oil Company to obtain exclusive rights to prospect for oil on ie Arabian littoral, I have the honour to forward herewith for the inform- feion of the Government of India a copy of the following correspondence on le subject :r— (1) Letter dated 22nd December 1921, from Resident Director, Anglo-Persian Oil Company, to Political Resident, asking to be allowed to open negotiations with Bahrain and enclosing (2) Letter dated 22nd December 1921, from Resident Director, to His Excellency the High Commissioner, Baghdad, asking to be allowed to open negotiations with the Sheikh of Kuwait and enclosing draft agreement.

(5) Letter No; 36-S., dated 10th January 1922, from Political Resi dent, Persian Gulf, to Resident Director, Anglo-Persian Oil- Company, Mohammerah. 2. I do not think that the* procedure suggested by Sir Arnold Wilson— iz., that he and I should proceed to Bahrain with the draft agreement and ry and get the Sheikh to sign it—is likely to be successful, because ths sheikh is very old and obstinate and will require a lot of talking to jbefore ie will agree to sign any such agreement. This, as I have stated in enclo- ure No. 3, can only be done by the Political Agent in the absence of any epresentative of the Company resident in the place. When the Political Vgent thinks that the Sheikh has adopted a reasonable attitude and shows igns of being willing to sign, a representative of the Company might go )ver with a draft agreement for final discussion and signature. 3. From enclosure No. 4 it will be seen that the Political Agent, Kuwait ? eels certain that Sheikh Ahmad would not sign such an agreement straight jff; so I think that it will be best for the Political Agents in both places to io the preliminary negotiations. 4. If the procedure indicated abeve is adopted, there will be no need to Pollow that suggested in paragraph 8 of Sir Arnold Wilson's letter, which I venture to think is hardly suitable. As the same agreement is required from the Sheikhs of Kuwait and Bahrain and I shall have to deal with the Bahrain one, the most convenient plan would seem to be for me to arrange both, but for me to appear at Kuwait on behalf of the High Commissioner and then proceed to Bahrain as the representative of Government seems anomalous. A copy of this letter is being sent direct to the India Office. Enclosure I to Serial No. 13. —Letter from Sir A. T. Wilson, Resident Director, Stmck Scott , &amp; Co., Ltd.. to the Honourable the Politi cal Resident.

I beg to dDply for permission to negotiate on the same lines with the Sheikh of Bahrain, and to solicit your personal assistance in the matter in due course: I venture to hope that if and when permission to negotiate is granted you will find it possible to be present in person at the negotiations. 3. I further solicit your assistance in obtaining from the Trncial Chiefs conventions in regard to the Exploitation of Oil similar to those already made with Kuwait (27th October 1913) and Bahrain (14th May 1914). — ^ Enclosure II to Serial No. 13. — L etter from S ir A. T. W ilson, R esident D irector, S trick S cott &amp; Co.. L td., to H is E xcellency the H igh C ommissioner, B aghdad, dated the 22 nd D ecember 1921. I have the honour to state that I have been instructed by the Board of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company limited to open negotiations with the Sheikhs'of Bahrain and Kuwait with a view to concluding agreements with them in connection with Oil in their territories. 2. As you are no doubt aware, it was provided under the arrangements concluded in 1914 for a fusion of interests in regard to Turkey of the D'Arcy Exploration Company and of the Turkish Petroleum Company that none of the participants would interest themselves in concessions any where in the Ottoman Empire otherwise than through the Turkish Petro leum Company. 3. The Clause in question reads as follows :— . . ' 10. The three groups participating in the Turkish Petroleum Com pany shall give undertakings on their own behalf and on be half of the Companies associated with them not to be interested directly or indirectly in the production or manu facture of Crude Oil in the Ottoman Empire in Europe or Asia, except in that part whfch is under the administration of the Egyptian Government. or of the Sheikh of Kuwait or in the 'Transferred territories' on the Turko-Persian Frontier, otherwise than through the Turkish Petroleum Company '. 4. You will note that the territories of the Sheikh of Kuwait are specifically excluded. 5. The Board do not consider it necessary at this stage to incur the considerable expense involved in registering a new subsidiary Company, and propose that negotiations should be conducted on behalf of the D'Arcy Exploration Company. I trust that this course wi 1 ] have your concurrence, 6. I enclose a draft of the Concession which T propose to negotiate with the Shaikh of Kuwait, if and when I have your authority to do so, for which authority I now beg to apply. 7. As regards Article 10 of the draft, in view of the fact that the Bakhtiari Khans are taking such strong exception to the deduction of In come Tax on dividends to which they are entitled, the Company would prefer to a share interest an arrangement under which an annual payment equivalent to 10 per cent, of the nett profits, after providing for deprecia tion, etc., should be paid to the Shaikh. In this connection reference is invited to the terms on which the A. P. O. C. holds its concession from the Persian Government: viz., 16 per cent, of nett profits. It is considered by the Board that not more than 10 per cent, would be justified in the case of Kuwait and Bahrain in view of the somewhat unpromising prospects of finding oil at either place, and the very heavy capital expenditure involved, and of the purely nominal assistance in regard to protection required from the Chiefs at either place—practically no pipe line would be needed for example if oil we#e found. - 8. I have no official information as to whether Kuwait is at present for purposes bf Political Administration under Baghdad or Bushire, and only venture to address you on the subject as the result of an informal conver sation with the Political Agent 1As however I have also to negotiate with Bahrain, and as I would propose to do so (subject to the approval of the Political Resident) immedi ately after the completion of negotiations with Kuwait, I venture to ask that Lieutenant-Colonel Trevor may be authorised bv you to accompany me to Kuwait in R. 1. M. S. ' Lawience ' to assist me on your behalf in these negotiations ; without your or his presence the Shaikh might, on view of his arrangements on the subject with Government, not feel justified in negotiating. 9. I have sent a copy of this letter with enclosures to the Honourable die Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and to the Political Agent at Kuwait. COPY.

So far His Majesty's Government have not given permission for nego tiations to be opened, no doubt however they will do so shortly. When thev do however I think the best plan will be for the Political Agents to prepare the way by preliminary talks with the respective Sheikhs. I am quite certain that the Sheikh of Bahrain who is as you know very old and rather obstinate will never agree to sign an agreement 'of this sort straight off. He will need a lot of talking to and persuasion which can onl} be done by the Political Agent as there is no representative of the Company resident at Bahrain. I do not know the present Sheikh of Kuwait but the Political Agent states that he is quite sure that Sheikh Ahmad would not be willing to si^n the agreement without lengthy discussions and consultations. In the circumstances I think the best course would be to instruct the Political Agent at Bahrain to discuss the question with the Sheikh when ever possible and report when the Sheikh shows signs of becoming amenable; a i cpresentative of the Company could then proceed to Bahrain with th? draft agreement tor final discussion and signature If necessary I would support the Political Agent in the preliminary negotiations I think similar procedure would probably be best in Kuwait also, l^of 1 liitle Ltoti iMo tfilsffl fie oil i ifilf, J:M Ac ™0 VzcE-CoNsnL.

Dated the 17th Ramadhan 134L 3rd May 1923, To ' „ . , His Excellency, my respected friend, Sir ARNOLD WILSON. After compliments and inquiries after your healthy which I hope is good I beg to state that I received your letter dated the 4th April 1923. 1 am highly grateful for the sincere feelings of friendliness expressed by lour Honour towards this friend; and it goes without saying that the same was considered by us as a measure of the high-mindedness and laudable virtues which characterize you. Your deputv, Mr. Mackie, arrived at our place, al-Hasa and delivered to us the draft of the agreement relating to exploitation for oil in our terri tories We conferred with him and explained to him that it was difficult for us to accept terms differing from those contained in the agreement (sub mitted by) Holmes, because the latter had been submitted to an assembly consisting of the Ulema and the Notables formed under the presidency of our father, the Imam. It was beyond the power of this friend to countermand what is confirmed by this assembly. I called upon your deputy, therefore to refer to Your Honour on the subject, and I agreed to negotiate with him if you accepted the terms of the Holmes agreement as the basis for negotiation. I deeply regret, however, that 1 received a letter from Mr. Mackie, stating that Your Honour had not agreed to this, and that he would take leave and abandon his request, In view of this circumstance, it only remains for this friend to state to you definitely that he does, firstly, appreciate the important positiqn you hold, and that he does secondly, know full well the enterprise and power and the ability of your Company to work. For this reason I was really sorry to see that you broke the negotiations at the outset. You may rest assured that, had the question not been submitted to the assembly of the Ule ma and the Notables, I would have endeavoured to afford you satisfaction as far as possible and in any manner- Seeing that it has gone out of this friend's purview, I think that you will excuse me if I demanded what I asked for as above. This is what I desired to state, and before I close this letter, 1 would mention my admiration for the gallantry, gentlemanliness and noble charac ter of your deputy, Mr. Mackie, who earned a special regard in our esti mation in consideration of his distinguished characteristics. In conclusion I would beg of you to accept my assurance of esteem. (Sealed). ABDUL AZIZ BIN ABDUR RAHMAN BIN FYSAL AL SAUD. Sub-Enclosure II to Enclosure to Serial No. 65. OIL CONCESSIONS. N ejd. Report by Mr. J. B. Mackie, I On my arrival at Bahrein I found awaiting you a letter from Bin Saud m reply to your letter dated February 24th, which I took the liberty of opening and forwarded it to you under cover of my letter No. 3, dated April 15th, retaining a copy of the translation for my own file. The position taken up by him in that letter he maintained, with sligW modification, throughout the whole of our negotiations, namely that th&amp; negotiations with the Eastern General Syndicate had reached a point at which he had given them a definite promise that he would grant them the■V .y-,'- concess^n on the terms already agreed to, subject to one or two slight / ■ ' ^ modifications which Major Holmes was at that time considering and pro- / . vided that the High Commissioner at Baghdad could assure him that the / / / Eastern and General Syndicate was a genuinely British Company. This / ! assurance, he says, has now been received from the High Commissioner. \ v ,f Acting on the instructions given me in your telegram dated April 17th I suggested to him that the Colonial Office did not regard him as having made any binding promises, but his reply was that the opinion of the Colonial Office did not really affect the matter in this instance and in any case seeing that a large part of the agreement had been drafted through the agency of Sir Percy Cox's secretaries, whom he and Ibn Saud and Major' Holmes met at Ujair some months ago, and that it was largely through Sir Pircy Cox's intervention that he had consented to give the concession jio the Eastern and General Syndicate at all, he did not see that the Colonial Office was in a position to do anything except support the Eastern and General Syndicate now, unless it was to be guilty of a complete volts face, and he did not think that Sir Percy Cox would agree to any such complete change of front. After several interviews which I had with him and his representatives, I got him to agree in writing that if we, while accepting the administrative and political provisions of the Eastern and General Syndicate's draft, were willing to improve on their 'financial offer he would consent to open nego tiations, but referred the right to refer our enhanced offer to the Eastern and General Syndicate to see if they would bid higher again. I replied to him that in our draft, many of the administrative and political clauses had been copied word for word from the Eastern apxi General Syndicate s draft, and that those which were not so, differed only in as far as we had made arrangements for the grant of the concession to cover the whole of the Sultan's territories— subject to our entering territory outside the Hasa province only by the Sultan's definite permission and by the inclusion 01 certain clauses which were as much in the interests of the Sultan as those of the Company, regarding the occupation and acquisition by the Company of private property, some of which he was himself asking the Eastern and General Syndicate to include in their agreement. ' Ibn Saud said that he could not consider the grant of the concession for any area outside the Hasa province. The time was not yetnpe^foi the admission of foreign influence into the less civilised parts ^ his jealm. l|. That is the attitude which he always adopts when he %^ J namely that of a Sultan having but little hold over a fanatical crw savages who frequently get out of hand. As a ma - , mor e he his the Ikhwan completely under his control only m the more no doubt that, considering the circumstances, you would agree. Then it was that, he produced the argument which ™f n S g U ^ d e to block any suggestion which J™ S ' iries w ithout,' however, obtaining validity of which I have made oaieful 9 a^ent in such matters any definite result He clairasthat he isjiot ^freeagent ^i ^ as this but is bound by a Council o found him alone! of his father. One evening when I had callea on n lain t0 without even any of his confldential secretaries fce proie^ me the position of this council ^d c-W ^ ^ ^ belong to the senior ' You wiU understand , he said nr( ij nar y course of events should branch of the Saud family, and so, in senior representative of the not have .U.l.ed PXtCC™ « who, a few year, .go senior branch is one Saud wno no a^thern provinces ■ with a view to raised the standard of revolt m - • lhn Saud, having getting for himself the position w i t 0 terms with his opponents crushed the ' r ? volt ^^S^Vnon oFa council of Ulama under the presidency and consented to the formation 01of bis father to whom all important questions should be referred, he beina 1 left considerable freedom of action in general matters but being merely thp Council's executive officer as regards matters which have been referred to it. He professes to be very anxious regarding the security of his positinn and very afraid lest he may give his opponents a loophole for setting in a tellmg blow on him. How far that this claim that this Council.is a pWr- iul body whose views he dare not oppose is true, or how far it is merely a foil to be used when he wants to block proposals made to him, I Wa o unable to discover very clearly. There seems to be some difference of opinion about it, at any rate among the people of Hasa. It is certain that the council exists and that the Eastern and General Syndicate's draft was shown to its members before any reply was given about it, but there hp some grounds for the belief that it is ' Ibn Saud's servant much more than ms master. ♦ The presidency of the council can easily be made by a master- individual, a position of paramount importance in the state and in the cQurse of a conversation one evening, ' Ibn Saud gave me a very broad hint that when his father dies he may himself appoint one of his sons Sultan and himself become Imam of the Ikhwan and president of the Council a position which would give him immense power and authority while at the same time allowing him to disclaim all responsibility whenever he found it convenient to do so. Be that as it may be, however, it was this claim of |iis which finally blocked my negotiations with him. He maintained that in spite of all argument, that he would not dare to give affront to the Council by making fresh proposals to them after they had discussed and accepted the Eastern and General Syndicate's draft as it now stood- subject to certain modifications which they had demanded—and the only conditions under which he would be willing to negotiate with the A. P. 0 C was that we should accept the whole of the Eastern and General Syndicate's draft and the modifications asked for word for word in both the English and Arabic versions and that in addition we should make a financial offer which showed a clear advance over anything which the Eastern and General byndicate had offered. At the same time he refused ooint blank to receive his royalty m any other form other than by share participation insisted.on the payment of 1 per cent, export duty as laid down in the Eastern and General Syndicate's draft, and on the payment of import duty on ail the goods imported for the personal use of the Company's Staff, and at the same time while admitting that our offer to pay the guards was an advance on the offer made by our rivals, declaring that he was quite willing to pay them himself. b 4 It seemed to me that m spite of his plausible talk and flattering refer- ences to the Company he had never any intention of giving us the conces- sion if he could possibly help it, and he intended to use us merely as a means of getting the Eastern and General Syndicate to bid higher than they ^ • J ^T g 80 116 Y™ not little sur prised and dis- t } n{or ™ e d hl ™ that I had been instructed to break off ? ^ fJ 11 ^ 0I 7 led hln J Wore leaving, however, that if his nego- s i 1 . e i . a stern and General Syndicate did finally break down tha r ff eaV1 ?f i • e door negotiations open and were willing to discuss discussions any time ' but usin g our dr aft as the basis of the ' jJ'A 1 d f S i re t0 P l, a f e 011 Zfcord by appreciation of the way in which nlopo i ^ tieated me whrle at Ilasa.

I must further point out to you, O my friend, that vour resnecW lather, .Shaikh Isa, was not acting in accordance with the promise tmw n, him to Major Trevor on the 18th Jamadi II, 1332 when he concluded - ven I. pro\ isional agreement or granted a orovisional concession to Maio r tTnlmoo the wording of that letter is very strong ' I wi!i not entertai over uS trom any quarter regarding kerosine oil without consulting the Pnlit .v!)

With reference to paragraph 4 of that despatch, will you please let me know whether there are any recent developments of the Sultan of Nejd's attempt to absorb Qatar. It seems to me that we ought to try to get Shaikh Ahmed 'bin Qasim openly recognized as on the same footing as the six Trucial Chiefs, though remain -ing in the Bahrain Agency.

You will see that, as regards Bahrain and Kuwait, bhey have in accordance with Colonel Trevor's suggestion been informed that unless they have successfully accomplish- -ed oheir oojects by the 31st of March next, other companies will be allowed go institute negotiations on their own r behalf. 1- 3. I fully agree with Colonel Trevor that it would be most undesirable to allow the Anglo Persian Oil Company indefinitely to prolong the negotiations and thereby pre- -vent other companies having an opportunity of securing concessions in these areas. I should be glad to learn at an early date whether in fact the Anglo Persian Oil Company have made any material progress towards accomplishing their objects in either Bahrain or Kuwait. 4. As regards the territory of the Shaikh of Qatar, I note that Colonel Trevor considered that there would be little objection to throwing ppen this area also to compet- -ition, the Shaikh himself being anxious to negotiate a concession. As you will see in the enclosures to my despatch No. 6 of the 7th of February, while feeling bound to recognise the Anglo Persian Oil Company's prior claims as regards Qatar, I do not consider the present a suitable time on general political grounds, for negotiations to be insoit- -uted, and I find myself unable to modify my previous attitude so far as this area is concerned.Enclosure to Colonial Office Despatch No. 15 of 27th May 1924. 22811/19244 Downing Street, 27th May 1924.

You will doubtless agree that it is 'undesirable that negotiations should be prolonged further than is absolutely necessary, especially in view of the fact that other applications from companies have been received by His Majesty^ Government for facilities similar to those which have been affordeil to yourselves. Mr. Vhomas desires me to take this opportunity of stating for your Company^ information, that your claims to priority will be recognised as at present, up to the 31st of March next; but that shoulc you have failed to accomplish your objects by that time. His Majesty's Government will feel bound to entertain pro- —posals from other applicants to be allowed to proceed wi^h the institution of negotiations for oil concessions in these areas. I am.

I advised Mackie to repeat the in vitation without appearing too obviously pressing &amp; to leave it to me to follow it up. He agreed that this was the best course, however since he has left here I learn that he fired in a long draft concession or something of the kind to Shaik Hamad while out at Sukhair. Mackie kept me entirely in the dark as regards this move &amp; made absoHlutely no mention of it.I had thereforen no opportun -ity to express an opinion. I think personally that it was a mistsice, inasmuch as he had only a few days before had a mild refusal from Hamad who was otherwisw cordial to hiia.Even Hamad is not so obtuse as to fail to see an invitaion proffered through with one hand,while a draft concession is handed him with the other. The have business part should obviously been produced after an impression had been made by the Muhammerah visit. I now that Hamad is quite off going there &amp; is obviously evasive„ From what I know of Hamad, I very much doubt that the ,. , , story he told Mackie( which he has often dished upx ior me too) about his reverence for his father's wishes has much to do with his own refusal-though it serves him as a convenient excuse. Perhaps if Muscat came to terms it might influence him to some extent,but unfortunately they think m of Bin Saud whose star is in the ascendant,ALL COMMUNICATIONS TO BE ADDRESSED TO THE COMPANY AND NOT TO INDIVI DUALS, % ^ Oil limited.

In deciding to waive my objections to the work I was greatly influenced by information received from MaclLie who reported that you had seen Madgwick's papers and were satisfied that he was merely an artesian well expert and had been engaged on that work all his life; and that as far as you knew he had no connection with oil. I now hear privately that ivladgwick is actually an extremely well-informed Petroleum Geologist possessed of wide experience in Ztussia, Houmania, l.Iexico and elsewhere and that he was actually at one time a Professor ofpetroleum technology at Birmingham. IMs vould appear to rer^ve any doubts I may have had hitherto that Holmes, though for the moment debarred ft-om active negotiations in Bahrein, is actually leaving no stone unturned to obtain valuable infor ^tion which he is permitted to collect in spite of the Colonial Office's promise to give us preferential consideration up to the end of this month.

Sir, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Amery to acknow- -ledge receipt of your letter of the 1st September, regard- -ing your desire to negotiate an oil concession in the territory of the Shaikh of Bahrein, and to inform you that the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf is being informed that Kis Majesty's Government would not raise any objection to the conclusion of an agreement with the Shaikh of Bahreir. in accordance with the terms of the draft agreement, a copy of which accompanied the letter from this Department of the 28th August No. 38049/25. 2.. With regard to the question raised in the last paragraph of your letter under reply, I am to say that Mr. Amery has no objection mutatis mutandis to the conclusion 'by your Syndicate of an agreement in similar terms with the Shaikh of Kuwait, and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf is being instructed accordingly. It has been brought to Mr. Amery's notice that in the draft mining lease enclosed in Colonial Office letter of the 28th ultimo (36049) and agreed by you in your letter under reply, para- -graph 2 of Article IV provides for a privilege of customs exemption of indefinite duration. Mr. Amery as at present advised sees no valid reason why this privilege should continue to be enjoyed for any substantial period after the date upon which the Company shall have declared, ir accord- '•ance with Article 9 of the draft lease, that oil has been found ® SECRETARY, THE EASTERN AND GENERAL SYNDICATE .LIMITED,2 found in commercially exploitable quantities. He would accordingly propose that the following sentence should be added to Article 4 of the draft Mining Lease 'This privilege shall continue in force until one Jiear after the date upon which the Company shall have declared that oil has been found in commeccially exploitable quantities, or for a term of ten years, which-ever is the longer, w 3.

Since I heard .hat kajor Holmes was coming here definite- -ly to conclmde an oil concession, I have had some mis^iv- -ings as to the effect t. at such a concession would have on the wellare ol Bahrain generally. At present the life of the whole community is centred in the pearling industry, which brings in either directly or indirectly a verj, comfortaole revenue to the State. his industry is however in the course of reorganisation, and will require very careful handling for the next year or two before it is established on a stable footing. Is it wise at this ata, e to introduce into Baiirain a new industry such as oil, which if found in commercia -L quantities is likely to rival an even eclipse the pearling industry, particularly if the latter is not fully organised? Is there not the danger of Bahrain and also foreign di/ers giving up their old ca ling and engaging themselves in the more lucrative and less toilsome work of employees in a flourishing oil concern? Is this not likely to be the'last straw' for Bahrain nakhudas a .ready disgruntle by the few reforms now introduced in the x^oarling ind stryv And finally, is there not the danger of diving naknudas,and possibly 'Tajurs' too leaving Bahrain* and forming a new centre of the pearling industry in Debai or elsewhere? - arid then, one can imagine -he oil peteringja.

Bated the 7th January 19^7, Jfyjuyf You will recollect that I told you that Shaikh Hamad had let Khalil Kanoo Know that he had no objection to the import 'by him of materials for boring for water on his own and other private grounds, and that I had sent i^halil Kanoo a reply in the above sense» I understood from you that you objected to this permission as contrary to the terms of your agreement with the Bahrein Government whereby you obtained the sole right of exploring for oil etc 0# and that you inter preted your agreement with Shaikh Hamad as precluding anyone from boring for water outside Municipal limits, I informed you that I did not agree with your contention, as your monopoly was to search for oil etc only and I was of opinion that it did not prohioit other persons xroii ©btciining water for agricultural and other private purposes. As you still held your own opinion I thought it would oe as well to see Khali! Kanoo about the matter c He has written me a letter in which he states 'my boring will be confined to private^ lands, and if oil or any signs of it is found in any of my wells, I would at once inform the Government in case the above licence ifi concerned with it'. He has also assured me verbally that he has no connection with the ^oiglo Persian et any other oil Company and is concerned only with tae production of water as a commercial proposition in the sajne way as he bought motor boats and motor cars to Bahrein as a commercial venture. He claimed that Shaikh Hamad had stated publicly in open Ma 0 lis that so far from objecting to his bringing water boting plant he would welcome it as benefial to his people. This I know to be true. Khalil Kanoo has. however, at my request, agreed to defer the K)or Frank Holmes, Eastern and General Syndicate, Ltd., Bahrein,o &gt; the sinking of wells outside Municipal limist until I hcve received a reply to a reference I arn making to the Political Resident, Bushire by next mail as to the exact import of Article I of your Exploration Licence, 1. will ask that a definite ruling be obtained as early as possible so as to set at rest all doubts on tiie subject.

I ., C . x . j _ ., Political Bahrein, To The Secretary to the Hon'blt the Political Resiaent,Persian Gulf, B u s h i r e. Sir, I haye the honour to refer you to Captain ralconer's memorandum No.97-S. dated the 10th ^arch 1926 returning the ofifeinal copy of the Baitrein Oil Concession. 2, As you are aware Major Holiues obtained from the Banrein Government on 24th January 1926 a contract to drill with the utmost despatch a minimum of 12 water v/ellii'or a sum ol Rs.15, 000/- each. This vork has now been almost completed. There is nothing in the nature of a monopoly in this matter. 2. kr. ivhalil Kanoo of Manama, a gentleman who is interest ed in both marine and land mechanical transport in -baia-ein stated in a meeting of the iiunicipal Committee that, if permitted, he would be willing to import water boring plant and would undertake to provide water for agricultural and domestic purposes at a figure which he stated roughly to be about Rs,4000/-. Shaikh Hamad welcomed the proposal, whicn ne declared would be for the general benefit ol his people, whose convenience he always sougnt. Mr. Khali1 Kanoo next wrote to me saying that he intena- ed to import from England machinery for boring water wells on his own and other private lands on a business basis, ana asJced if there v.as any objection. I consulted Shaikh Hamad and then wrote to inform ia -.kanoo that I had made enquiries from K.i .'2 -v^T) ShaiJth Hamad who stated that he had no objection and approved the sanie. a copy 01 my le tter 1b enclosed marked a. ^&lt;&gt; v)n ^■ lie arrival of i .aj or Uolraes in Bahrein he objected to any person otner than hi/aself being granted permission to bore for water # i .he grounds on which he bases his oojection arc set forth in the attached oop^ of his letter to Mr.Belgrave Marked Bo I do not consider his contentions to be correct, and have informed him accordingly* Article 1 of tne Exploration j.icence granted to the Eastern and General Syndicate which is all that is operative at present,grants the Company an exclusive right through out the whole of the territories under the Shaikh of Bahrein's control 'to explore and search the surface of sucn territories to a aepth not exceeding 20 feet for natural gas, petroleum, asphalt and ozokerite' and nothing more. It does not, in my opinion, preclude persons other than the Company from trying to obtain water for agricultural ana domestic purposes. Major Holmes at first contended, but he appears to have receded from this position, that nobody could be permitted to dig below 20 feet, which was obviously absurd as it would have renaered the digging of v/ells impossible. 5, On coming to know of Major Holmes* contention I sent for Mr.Khalil hanoo to ascertain his views. He has assured me that he has no connection with the Anglo Persian (his uncle is local agent) or any other Oil company, and that his sole object is to try to get i /vater lor domestic ana agricultural purposes on his own and other pri/ate lands, and by doing so make a small business profit. He has given me &lt;x written undertaking that he will at once inform the Government oi Baxxrein if any traces of oil are found in any of the wells he sinks, I ascertained from him that he has agreed with certain local lana owners to sink wells in their gardens to obtain water lor their fruit trees, but that he has not yet purchased the water oonng machinery though he has been in correspondence with some English ana American firms on tne subject. On ay informing him that there was a doubt about the exact imp o r timport 01 ceitain conaitions in ka., or Holmes * oil concession and that he claimtd tUe right of prchobitjtling all persons froni boring in Bahrein he readily agreed to deler any further action regarding che import 01 machinery until I had referred the matter I mav be given a ruling is whether the licence granted to the jiastern and General Syndicate precludes other persons from searching for water. It is possible that this question has not risen elsewhere, as, so far as I am aware, the position in Baiirein as regards water is peculiar. It has been shown that water fit for agricultural and domestic purposes can be obtained i &gt;n these islands in large quantities by small borej of 1 £0 to 200 feet deptn. This water is of inestimable value to the populace ana I do not consider tnat the Lastern and General Syndicate in addition to their oil monopoly should be granted what, if major Holmes* view were adopted, woula amount tu a monopoly in new sources of water supply aiso» Major Holmes confessed in conversatiun with me to a handsome profit on each of the water wells he has made and stated t -aat he was willing to bore further wells at prac Licall,y cost pri^e • inis sounds very magnanimous but unless outside coiipc tition is allowed it is impossible for any one but the Company themselves to juuge the correct figure for this cost price. tiic Hon'bis the Political Hcsiaent's ruling on the point at iasue to Bushire and had. obtained a definite ruling on the douotful point» 6, The matter at issue at present, about which I request that 7 I request that I may be informed as early as possible oi I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most o servant, Political Agent, Laurein,Copy of a letter date^ the 5th January 19V7. irom or Prar^ Holaes, for ajia on hthaif of eastern ana Genera.

The point at issue is whether other than he should be permitted to bore.

I had already obtalned all the useful Geological data within that area. I have recently sunlf private well for Mr. Khalil A1 3a k ir behing the fort, at a very nwch reduced price in order to obtain Geological informations on the other leg of the well defined Anticline, which run»&gt; c tt t. k ™ ' - lllP -• J -* 4 h.tl. accoss the Northern Portion of this Island. If Khalil Hakir had requested me to well Oji the leg of this Anticline from which all the ruriatpal water supply has been derived^ would have not taken a contract to do so for three times the amount he gave for his present well. The private wells that I intend doing are those from which I expect, from the surface indications to secure valuable Geoiogical information, other wells in areas which we have secured the Geological data do not interest me, and certainly not, at any less price than our Government Contract price. The drilling of those private wells which the company undertakes. ± b proep^ctirifc work so far ag the Company is concerend. When an area is ofcsely prospected by drilling it does not interest us further. This stage has only been reached in the Municipal area The Anticline mentioned above practically runfi from one end of Date Balm area to the other, therefore it is along this Anticline that I am prepared to drill a limited number of cheap wells for garden owners, both parties thereby benefiting, the gardens ootc^ining a oOiiiJu»iiw euppiy oi uneay water and my Company secux-/ ing ^ (3) P.

As regards the last paragraph of your letter, I do not agree that it is a reasonable request, specially, if one considers that Kanoo had been constantly trying for the past four months, with those persons who require wells, to persu ade tne;n give him the drilling contracts. These are the peop e with A I could have signed up contractB a year ago, If I had not been urged against doing so by the action of two previous Political Agents in Bahrein and one Political Resi dent, although my water contracts make no mention ofi not being permitted to enter into water boring contracts outside the n-overnraent Contracts.
