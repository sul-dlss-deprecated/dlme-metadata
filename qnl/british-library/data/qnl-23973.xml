That of the 18th was for His Excellency Shaikh Sir Hamad - Letters of invitation are on Vernacular Office files. Verbal enquiry was, as usual, made before writing. 2. A Garden Party was held on the 21st November 17.30 to 19.30 hours. List of persons invited is below. At noon on the 21st the position was:- Accepted 73 (Including House Party: Political Resident, Hr. R.H. Butler, Counsellor Tehran, Mr. Humphrey, f.^anager, Raraehi Cable and Wireless). Refused 10. Hot replied 5 (Two believed away). Also four Officers of 'Shareham' and two film makers of Strand Film Company. Action taken to prepare for Garden Party is the note attached. 3, Two copies of invitations are placed below. L 'J- J 1 • 3 • '^7-ITote on two invitation incidents in connection with the Garden Party on 21st Fovember 1936. Fr. E.J. m honpson came to the Assistant Political Agent (Mr. Howes) md told hi : that they had not had an invitation. It was Pound that one had actually been sent and Mespers* signature was in the peon book. A duplicate invitation was sent. (There has been previous difficulty I understand over the loss of letters addressed to T 'rs. and Fr. Thompson - but nothing to do with Agency). 2. Hr. and Hrs. Washburn and Hr. Graham did not answer the invitations. I asked Hr. Smith if they had got then-, he could not be certain beyond that they had gone out with the others. I think that their not replying was deliberate owing to unpleasantness which had arisen over the St. Andrews’ Fight f s Party to which Hr. and Hrs. Hashbum were not asked (though Hr. Graham had foo:ishly told them that they would be) owing to their behaviour the year before. Their names (Hr. and Mrs. Pashbum and T 'r. Graham) should be noted as not to have invitations on future occasions.Arrangements for Garden Party* 1. Lights for garden (coloured) done by Mr. Steele. 2. Tent side screen put up across garden path just v/est of the tank to prevent guests seeing the pantry work. Done by David. 3. Hired ten dozen glasses. Bought fifteen dozen sodas (bottles hired surplus returnable). Blocks of ice from Bapco. Hired chairs (30) through Jashanmal, who eventually made no charge. 4. Arranged:- Chairs and teapoys. A dhurri is placed just by the garden door on which the Political Resident receives guests. Drinks - Whisky, sherry, beer and barley water. Biscuits and oddments. Fruit salad. 5. Ferashes divided:- Door. Huhammed Shahdad. r Abdul Karim. Ibrahim. *Ali. Hein serve■ *Abdullah. Huhammed Qaiyum. Husain. Indian Assistants ferashes helped behind with pantry. 6. Launch crew did car parking: guests drove up to guard gate and cars were parked on open space. Guests walked through courtyard. Suitable parking notices were put up and gates closed.fV (Fy B.O. no. 411-19/S. ?he 18th Febiniiiry 1937 • We should like to give a Garden Perty for you and your J, ife when you pass through here after the Chiefs * Gathering* If so, would Saturday, the 37th M arch, suit you ?
