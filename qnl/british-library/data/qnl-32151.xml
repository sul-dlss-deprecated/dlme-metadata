C. Water low Secretary FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.1. 2nd December, 1949*20 miles off the Eastern coast of Arabia. The total . population is about 100,900a The State formerly subsisted almost entirely on its entrepot trade and on its pearling ^ industry, which today is moribund. Apart from oil (see below), the State possesses no economic resources. About one-twentieth of its area is cultivated under irrigation, and recommendations for intensifying and improving the State’s agriculture have recently been made by Sir Herbert Stewart, Agricultural Adviser to the British Middle East Office* 6* In 1932 oil was discovered and is now being exploited by Uio American-owned Bahrein Petroleum Company, ^ro^uction is at present static at about 1.5 million tons per annum, and it is estimated that the reserves will be exhausted in about 50 years. The Bahrein refinery handles a throughput of about 7 million tons of crude oil per annum, of v/hich 6 million tons is imported from Saudi Arabia, 7* For the past 14 years Bahrein has received oil royalties amounting to about £250,000 per annum, which were increased in 1948 to £ 365,000 per annum and which will probably now be further increased as a result of the current oil royalty negotiations. These royalties account for nearly half of the State’s revenue, the balance being derived mainly from customs duties. For over 20 years the State has been administered by Mr. Carol Belgrave, the Sheikh’s British adviser, and under his sound guidance it has become probably the best administered non-British State in the Middle East, Hauntedby the prospect of the exhaustion of the oil reserves, the Sheikh and Mr. Belgrave have agreed in pursuing a conservative financial policy. The oil royalty income (apart from the Sheikh’s share ^iich is one-third of the total) has been allocated partly to capital expenditure on revenue- producing schemes and partly to a reserve fund v/hich now amounts to about £1 million,. This fund is invested mainly in Government of India securities on which a return of 2^ to is received. The Government of India have so far refused permission to the Bahrein Government to sell these securities, $• Although under Mr. Belgrave’s administration much development of public amenities - schools, hospitals, roads, electricity, telephones, etc, - has already taken place, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf considers that there is considerable scope for further development to improve the amenities and social conditions in the State, and that such development could absorb the oil royalty revenues - for some years to come, (c ) Kuweit . This State is situated at the North West corner of the Gulf, and consists of a waterless desert which is roughly a square of 90 miles in each direction. The total population is estimated at about 150,000, of which 70,000 live in the town of Kuweit, Apart from oil (see below), the State’s economy is based upon its entrepot trade and ship-building industry. It is the natural port of North- East Arabia and trans-shipment port for the produce of the smaller Gulf ports pnd of India,, Kuweit is famous throughout the Gulf for the ship-building of native craft (dhows), for which the timber is imported from the Malabar coast. OwingOwing to th^ complete absence of* water there is no scope for . a^icultural development, „ I?- . The Burgan oilfield in Kuweit is the largest single ???&gt; 1 the World t Th e Kuweit Oil Company, which is info ^ ? nd half American, began production in 1946. •ir, j or? ut ^ ut had already reached 6.2 million tons. Production ^2 1 , is ? x P ectGd to amount to 25 million tons and. in 1 956 'to oftons. In 1947 the Sholsh of Kuweit rocuived £500,000 in oil royalties, and in 1948 £1.5 millions. Koyaitios for 1949 are expected to amount to £ 2.9 million and by 1958 it is estimated that they will have reached the i? ve } million. In addition the Sheikh has received J 4 Tu l^n cl -°Tlars for his share in the concession rights in the neutral zone (this sum is believed to be lying intact in a Now York Bank), and he receives also a minimum.annual payment of 625,000 dollars. • ♦ . 11. The Sheikh of Kuweit has consistently refused to employ a British administrator or Financial Adviser. Unlike Bahrein there is no tradition of British advice and our Interference is, in fact resented. As a result the administration ’of the State and in contrast to Bahrein is primitive and chaotic. The Sheikh’s policy is at present essentially conservative, and neither he nor his people- •' realize the possibilities and problems raised by their immense acquisition of wealth. A substantial amount of development of public amenities is, however, taking place in an unplanned and haphazard way. The Political Resident at Bahrein considers 18 scope for improvements to absorb a ' substantial part of the oil royalty income for some time to come. .... , , { d ) Qatar. This state is a peninsular on the Arabian mainland about 100 miles long and 30 miles in width. It is almost waterless and consists largely of low barren hills. The population which is only about 16,000 has hitherto subsisted largely on pearl diving. Petroleum Development (Qatar) Limited, a British subsidiary of the Iraqi Petroleum Compcmy is now established in the State, and oil production is expected to start in 1950 and to amount to 2 million’tons in that year. The Sheikh will then receive » t £450,000 in oil royalties. In 1956 production is expected to amount to 3 million tons and oil royalty receipts to £675,000. The new Sheikh, v/ho has just acceded to power, has agreed to appoint a British Adviser who will, it is hoped, be able to ensure that the oil royalties are spent on sound development projects or suitably invested. 13# (e) Trucial Coast , seven small states: Tho Trucial Coast consists, of Abu Dhabi, Ajman, Dubai, Ummal Qawain, Ras AI-Khaimah.‘and Kalba 9 ^ on the low-»lying coast to the east of the Watar peninsular. The largest town, Dubai, is said to possess 38,000 inhabita.nts. Oil has not so far been discovered, but Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Limited, an associate of the Iraqi Petrol Company, is planning to undertake drilling operations early In 1950. Other development possibilities are limited to the developmentdevelopment of water resources, which may be possible on a small’'scale, and fishery development which might be undertaken in conjunction with the Muscat fisheries# .3* UTILIZATION OF OIL ROYALTIES. » ‘‘ ^ 14# From tbc above brief des’cription of the economic • situation In each of the Persian Gulf States, it will be seen that an unusual and remarka.ble problem is presented. In , ;these States (except to a limited degree in Muscat) there are virtually no possibilities for any major long-term development of natural resources, other than oil. The lines of development can therefore only lie in the provision of public amenities, the improvement of social conditions and-certain very limited agricultural improvements. Yet three of these states - Bahrein, Kuweit and Qatar - are earning,’or are about' to earn, sterling and dollar revenues on a scale out of all ■' [ proportion to their current needs for financing development on these lines. In the Trucial Sheikhdoms, there is a reasonable prospect that oil will be 'discovered. There isperhaps a certain irony in'the fact that in the last state, Muscat, which is the only state that possesses resources that might be capable, of reasonable development (fishing, agriculture rind .minerals) no oil has yet been found and the prospects of finding it are considered uncertain. • '• * ' v • ' •• ‘ . * . 15* In addition to the oil royalty 1 revenues which are paid to the Sheikhs, the oil companies are expending large ' sums locally in Bahrein, Kuweit and Qatar.^ A condition of inflation may thus develop in these states, and the time has probably now come when it would'be advisable for the Sheikhs (if they could be persuad.ed to. do so) to introduce taxation - direct or indirect - in order to mop up • ’ excessive purchasing power. Such a policy would, however, increase the already surplus Government revenues. 16. The outstanding problem intho Persian Gulf States is therefore that of investing wisely the surplus revenues of those States which possess oil resources. The first charge on these, revenues must obviously be the-development of the • States themselves on the linos indicated above. Such development will involve: (a) revenue producing.-capital development projects - e.g. power stations, harbours, etc., and (b) non-revenue producing capital development -projects -• e.g. schools, hospitals, etc. As regards, ('*&gt;)» it .has -been k suggested by the Treasury representative in .the‘.Middle East that the* Sheikhs concerned..should be encouraged to pursue a policy .of endowment, involving the investment of a capital sum in British Government securities to produce an income sufficient to cover the estimated annual recurring expenses of the institutions concerned. Such capital sums would be allocated to specific objects and schemes and administered by a Trust. ; ‘.'Y 17. No attempt has so far been made to assess with any exactitude the extent to which the oil revenues of these States can be v/isely devoted to. local development. It is clear, however, that Kuweit and Qatar at any rate will, during the next few years, dispose of a larger revenue than, that ‘ requiredrequired to finance development programmes conceived on sound lines and adapted to their needs* The possibility therefore arises of securing the investment of these funds in some form of a Middle East Development Corporation which would utilize them for development in other Middle East L 'Untries where great resources exist but funds to exploit them are lacking - e.g, Syria, Jordan and possibly the development of the Muscat fisheries* This suggestion has been informally put to the Sheikh of Bahrein by Mr* Belgrave. his British adviser* The Sheikh has indicated that he might agree to invest his reserve (if he can succeed in selling out his Government of India securities) in some form of Middle East Development Corporation, provided such a Corporation had the support, if not the guarantee, of the’ British Government* In the case of Kuweit it is considered that it would at present be premature to make a similar suggestion to the Sheikh but it is hoped that the Financial and Commercial Secretary, who is shortly to be appointed to the Residency at Bahrein, will be able to influence the Sheikh to adopt a sound financial policy and in due course to raise the question of the investment of his surplus revenues with him* In the case of Qatar, the approach to the Sheikh will similarly have to wait until his British Adviser has been appointed and has established his position in the State* k. ^ RECOMMENDATIONS (a) We should encourage the Sheikhdoms which have substantial oil revenues - i*e. Bahrein, Kuweit, Qatar ~ to prepare an overall long-term development programme* which should be carefully balanced in the light of financial resources, and of the requiromofcts of tho state, between* (i) Revenue-producing capital development projects - power stations, harbours, etc*, and (ii) Non revenue-producing capital development projects - schools, hospitals etc* The programme might include provision for the endowments of certain projects under (ii). (*) We should consider the desirability of establishing some form of Middle East Development Corporation with British participation in which oil revenue surplus to the requirements described in (a) above could be invested and utilized for development in other areas in the Middle East* We should in due course, as and when political circumstances seem propitious, suggest to the States concerned that they should invest in such a Corporation. (e) We should encourage the development of resources other than oil (e.g* fisheries) when such development is economically sound; and should guide economic and social development on the right lines by assisting the gulf states in obtaining suitable experts*XX.

MUSCAT I. INTRODUCTION Geographically the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman consists of the main body of the State laying around the Hajar Range, and two appendages, the coastal plain of Dhufar which is cut off by the Rub al Khali, and the Port of Gwadur on the Makran Coast. The Sultanate includes a sea board of over 1 ,000 miles from the Musandam Peninsular to Ras Durbat Ali where the province of Dhttpe.r borders on the Aden Protectorate. Conditions in Gwadur and Dhofar are so very different from those in Muscat itself that it must always be remembered that remarks about the latter do not automatically apply to the other two. One of the main economic influences on Muscat and Oman in the past has been its self-contained character, due to the fact that land communications with the rest of the Arabian peninsula were blocked by the Rub al Khali. This meant that communication has to be mainly by sea, and in the earlier days of navigation Muscat was able by virtue of its position to take part in both the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea trade; its earlier periods of greatness usually coincided, therefore, with a flourishing maritime transit trade. However, both the progress of navigation which reduced the maritime importance of the Oman coast, and the suppression of the slave and arms traffics at the end of the last century, caused a decline in commerce from which the state has never really recovered; indeed, the economy of Muscat for this reason (as well as for certain others noted below) should still be considered in the main a contracting rather than an expanding one. The only towns of any size are the ports of Muscat, Matrah and Gwadur, and Matrah which is the biggest of these, contains less than 9,000 inhabitants. The population of Muscat and Matrah is very mixed and includes a large number of Indians both Hindus and Khozas, and Baluchis. There are many Baluchis on the Batinah Coast but elsewhere the population is mostly Arab* The bulk of the Arabs in Oman including the Sultan and his relatives are neither Sunni nor' Shiah but belong to the Ibadhi sect of Mohammedams. At Gwadur there is a wealthy colony of followers of the Aga Khan and the rest of the inhabitants are mostly Baluchis, 2, POLITICAL FACTORS Partly perhaps as a result of this decline of prosperity and economic importance, the Government has run into political difficulties owing to inability to exercise control over certain parts of its territories. The most intractable side to this problem is represented by the Imam, an elected Ruler, who has set up his own administration in the interior of the Central and Western Hajar Range; other areas, as for instance Sharqiyah and Shamaliyah, while claiming a varying allegiance to both the Sultan and the Imam, are in actual fact under little control of any kind. Broadly speaking, the Sultan s writ may be said to run only along the coast, and even this, is not true of the area between Ras al Hadd and Dhuiar. While these problems do not cause any great economic difficulties at the moment, the question will, and indeed has already become, one of paramount importance when the development of the interior is considered. 3. FISHERIES AND AGRICULTURE As matters stand now, invisible trade plays little partin the Muscat economy (two minor exceptions, however, are the trading fleet which still exists at Sur, though much reduced, and remittances both inwards from Arab properties in Zanzibar and outwards by members of the Indian community to India); it can be said, therefore, that most of its wealth comes from straightforward trading in the two main natural resources, agriculture and fisheries* The unique wealth and importance of the fisheries has been fully dealt with by Dr* Bertram in his report, *The Fisheries of Muscat and Oman 1 * (See Annex II) and the Sultan is now trying to engage foreign fisheries officers. The main agricultural area is the plain of the Batinah about 150 miles long with ample if not very accessible water supplies from the Ha,jar Range behind it; but there are other fertile areas also, such as that round Nizma on the reverse side the Hajar watershed, in the Imamus territory, and the interior of Sharqoiyah, which is.served by the port of Sur. The chief product is date^ which in their dried form are virtually the only agricultural export* There are many fertile oases in the Omam hills, the produce of which finds its way to the coast, and in Dhufar, which receives the monsoon rains, there are groves of cocoanut palms, millet and sugar cane crops are grown and the frankincense tree is found among the hills. In the past wet Muscat dates were exported to the United States of America where they were much esteemed for their quality, but efforts to revive this trade have failed owing to the impossibility of competing with the much lower, cost of Basra dates* At the moment the greatest part of the dried date output goes to India; the fact that the date harvest in Muscat precedes that in Iraq by almost a month enables them to hold a large share in the market* No general survey of agricultural possibilities in Muscat has yet been made, but in November, Mr* Hartley, Director of Agriculture at Aden, visited the Province of Dhufar at the request of the Sultan. He recommended the development of the irrigated area from 1,200 to h ,000 acres, the establishment of a small modern sugar factory, the improvement of livestock and the introduction of terracing and citrus growing on the hillsides. A summary of his report is attached at Annex III. The Sultan is now trying to engage a Palestinian agricultural officer for this province, who will presumably be charged with the execution of Mr. Hartley's recommendations. Meanwhile, arrangements have been made for Mr. Hartley to visit the Batinah coast this month and prepare a similar report. Charles Kendall and Partners, the Sultan's Purchasing Agents, are now, at the British Adviser's request, exploring the possibilitioo of forming a commercial company with British and local participants., to develop the fisheries. (See Annex II). They are also exploring the possibilities of expanding the date industry and are in touch with Messrs. Andrew Weir on this mattor* H.M. Political Resident considers that examination by an expert of the water resources on parts of the Batinah coast might make possible the formulation of schemes for increasing the water supplies in these areas. 4. COMMUNICATIONS The difference in cost between Muscat! and Iraqi dates is almost entirely a question of transport* There are no natural harbours along the Batinah, and Sur, the only port of the Eastern Hajar, is inadequate for anything larger than country /craftcraft; everything therefore must he shipped from Muscat or Muttrah. Cargoes are brought down to these ports in local boats for shipment, or, in the absence of any motorable roads, by camel caravan. There has been no grov/th of lorry transport similar to that in the deserts of Saudi Arabia, as the stoney wadis of the Ha jar Mountains are impassible to motor traffic without proper roadmaking. There is, however, a limited use of motor transport in the Batinah and a rough track has been established through to Sharjah on the Trucial Coast. The Sultan is making a small start by putting the Muscat State Infantry on to road building. 5. MINERAL RESERVES The mineral reserves, while constituting the best promise of an over-all improvement in the country’s economy, are as yet a completely negative asset. (a) Coal deposits of a high quality, exist at Sur, but this is a politically unstable area, and it is doubtful in any case of they could be worked economically in view of the cheap ness if oil fuel from the neighbouring Persian Gulf States. (A description of the deposits is given in Annex IV). (b) Petroleum Concessions Limited an associate of the I.P.C., are now prospecting for oil. This has to sane extent an unfortunate effect on State policy; there is a tendency for all difficult problems to be shelved 'until oil is discovered'. One of the Sultan’s main aims is to get the oil company to begin operations in Muscat; but it should be mentioned that the area, though it may have strategic advantages in the long run, is much less attractive for the concessionaires to work both from the geological and political standpoint than the Sheikhdoms up North. (c) Mineral Development in Dhufar Province In 1947 Sir Cyril Pox, formerly Director of the Geological Survey of India, surveyed the Dhufar province at the request of the Sultan. He reported the existence of large limestone deposits, and of gypsum, talc and lead. He considered that adequate resources were available for a cement and chemical industry, which could manufacture Portland cement, soda ash, and other chemicals such as lead pigments. He also considered that adequate water resources were available. Fuel would however have to be imported, in the form possibly of coal from Sur, or oil. He recommended that the Sultan should call in outside interests to form an 'Oman Mineral Industries Limited', first for a three year prospecting period, and then for actual mining and quarrying. Meanwhile the state should carry out topographical and engineering surveys, road construction, and the collection of data on water supply. We recently enquired what action the Sultan was proposing to take on these recommendations, and he has now replied that 'he would be very glad if some firm would come forward and assist with the development of a cement industry and the manufacture of chemicals'. He does not consider a topographical survey of the Dhufar Plain necessary and he points out that road development is already taking place. The further development of water resources depends on the result of his present search for an agricultural assistant for Dhufar. (see paragraph 3 )• 6 . GWADUR This small Port on the Mekran coast which is administered by a British officer, exists largely on the lowness of its customs dues and the resultant transit trade. In view of the uncertainty of its political future, there is no incentive to invest in any schemes of development for this dependency.7* SOCLiIi DEVELOPMENT (a) General The opportunities for social progress would appear •uperficially to he greater in Muscat than elsewhere in the Arabian peninsula, as their isolation has caused the Muscatis to remain aloof from the more fanatical movements of Islam; so much so that Palgrave could say in the middle of the last century that they could scarcely be considered Muslims, and even today the majority of the women still go unveiled* More recently, however, there has been a trend towards a more narrow and bigoted outlook, largely with a view to winning the approval of the tribesmen of the interior, who are much influenced by Wahabism* This policy of appeasing the Imamus subjects has been intensified during the last year, resulting for instance in restrictions on attendance in the American Mission School, and various ordinances regarding behaviour in public. (b) Education Education is limited to a few primary schools in the main centres of population, the best and biggest being in Muscat itself; the financial stringency of the authorities and the small demand for higher education in Muscat r s present state of development makes it unlikely that the system will be extended just now. Teachers are normally recruited from other countries in the Middle East, and some Palestinian refugees have been given employment; results, however, have not been wholly satisfactory as, owing to the climate and the isolation, most of them do not stay long. (See also Section IX.) (c) Health Hospitals and health services are inadequate. Only two hospitals exist, one in Muscat run by the British Quarantine Medical Service, and the other the American Mission Hospital in Muttrak, For the same financial reasons there seems little chance of the State taking up its responsibilities in health matters. It is perhaps fortunate that there is normally little serious disease in Muscat and Oman, with the exception of widespread ophthalmia and some malaria. (d) Labour It is possible that a chain of rising costs and other difficulties might be found in providing labour for a large development programme, as for some time past there has been a steady drain on the working population due to the high salaries being paid by the oil comparfes in Bahrain, Qatar and Kuwait; and the rate of the exodus still continues to mount, Mr. Woods-Ballard, the Sultan f s new British Foreign Minister is planning to introduce a more efficient system of taxation and accounting and to recruit staff for this from India. 8 . PUBLIC UTILITIES Bather inadequate steps are being taken to improve the electricity supply in Muscat and Muttrah (up till now the only efficient power plant has been that in His Majesty's Agency, on which even the Sultan has had to rely): and the Sultan has decided to put into effect a scheme for water supply produced by Holloway Brothers last winter both for the Capital and for Sur, where it is very badly needed.9. EMPLOYMENT OF FOREIGN EXPERTS The Sultan has recently engaged Mr. Woods Ballard, late of the Indian Political Service, as his Foreign Minister* This appointment has already produced a great improvement, particularly in respect of consistent planning and co-ordination. Mr. Woods—Ballard has succeeded in winning the confidence of the Sultan to such an extent that he is now supervising nearly all branches of the administration. Some Palestinian teachers are also employed, and the Sultan is now seeking to engage 3 medical officers, 3 fisheries officers, 2 auditors and an agricultural officer of Indian, Palestinian or other nationality, 10. DEVELOPMENT POLICY There is perhaps a certain irony in the fact that the only State in the Persian Gulf where certain development possibilities exist is also the only State where oil has not yet been found, and which therefore lacks the wealth to undertake this development. A first step has, however, been taken with the preparation of surveys, referred to above,on mineral resources and agriculture in Dhufar, and on fishery development; and a further agricultural report will shortly follow. The implementation of these reports av/aits the recruitment of certain experts, and the provision of funds. The Sultan*s financial policy is conservative, and although he is believed to have accumulated a moderate reserve during the war, he is apparently unwilling to put up capital for development from the State funds, and is evidently hoping to attract commercial enterprises who would bilieady to undertake the tasks for him. In such cases he would probably be willing to give a virtual monopoly to the Company concerned. At the moment most planning for development in Muscat is overshadowed by the twin connected problems of oil development and lack of control in the interior (the connexion lies in the fact that the areas which are most likely to contain oil are those whicty do not owe allegiance to the Sultan). Whether His Majesty s Government intend to take a part in trying to resolve this problem is a matter of higher policy, and out of place in this paper. Recommendations can only be made therefore on the assumption that the economic life of Muscat will continue as before in its minor key, and ambitious experiments and large scale investment which would be justified in on oil economy, would stand very little chance of successful returns.IV TRUCIAL COAST The Trucial Coast is the name given to the low-lying open coast stretching from the base of the Qatar peninsula on its eastern side up to the hills of the Musandum pensinsula a short way beyond Has al Khaimah* Before 1820, the coast Was j! cnown as Coast and it is now known as the Trucial Coasfcbecause the Sheikhdoms situated on it have undertaken to observe a perpetual truce with each other and the world at large on the sea. The.number of Trucial Sheikhdoms was originally 5 and owing to the splitting up of the Sheikhdom of Sharjah has become 7• Of the Sheikhdoms the most westerly, Abu Dhabi, is by far.the largest and is the most powerful tribally but the area it.covers is mostly desert and its capital, Abu Dhabi, is difficult of access. The next Sheikhdom proceeding in a north-easterly direction is Dubai. This Sheikhdom doeo not cover a very large area but the town is the largest on the coast and said to possess 38,000 inhabitants. There is a large and well-stocked bazaar and the Imperial Bank of Iranian! Messrs. Cray, Mackenzie have branches here. Hi® Majesty’s Government maintain a dispensary under an Indian doctor. Dubai is the main centre of supply for the whdle of the Trucial Coast and its hinterland and there is much trade by country craft with Persia. There are no local products and Dubai depends for its existence on its entrepot trade and pearl diving. The next Sheikhdom is Sharjah which has lost much of its former glory owing to the bulk of its territory having been formed into independent Sheikdoms, and the silting up of ito creek which has ruined it as a commercial centre. There are fairly extensive date gardens in the sub-montane area of this Sheikhdom and much of the country is covered with natural vegetation. The last Sheikhdom, Kalba, is situated beyond the hill® on the Gulf of Oman. Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Limited, an associate of the I.P.C., has obtained concessions for oil rights in the Trucial Sheikhdoms. It is planned to undertake drilling operations early in 1950. There are no roads on the Crucial coast. Meanwhile, unless and until oil is found, there are no resources to finance development and the development possibilities appear to be limited to: (a) Development of water resources. His Majesty’s Political Resident has suggested that examination of the water resources of part of the Trucial coast by an expert might make possible the formulation of schemes for increasing water supplies of those areas, (b) Fishery development. This might be undertaken in conjunction with the development of the Muscat fisheries.V QUTAR General Qatar is an ungainly peninsula on the Arabian mainland about 100 miles long and averaging 30 miles in width. It is almost waterless and consists largely of low barren hills, qv? 6 •^ own an y importance is Dohah on the east coast. The Sheikh lives at Riyan a few miles inland. The total population of the peninsula is only about 16,000 and consists mostly of miscellaneous Arabs who before the advent of the Oil Company obtained their living from pearl diving The climate is' similar to that of Bahrein except that it is slightly less humid. The -Minerican Mission have recently opened a dispensary at Dohah. There are.no postal and telegraph facilities. Gray Mackenzie have obtained Sheik*s permission to open a Branch at Dukhan ihey hope to be appointed as his purchasing agent. The Eastern Bank is opening a branch at Qatar and the British Bank of Iran are showing an interest in the States. The Oil Company - Petroleum Development (Qatar) Limited - maintain a landing strip but there is no air or steamer service to the peninsula and access to it is normally had by launch from Bahrein by way of either Zakrit, the Oil Company 1 s present port on the west coast, or by Dohah, 2 Oil Production Tho Oil Company has its headquarters at Dukhan near the west coast of the peninsula. Production is expected to start in 1930 , and to amount to two million tons in that year. The Sheikhdom will then receive £450,000 in oil royalties. By 1956 receipts are anticipated to rise to £675,000. The new Sheikh, who has just acceded to power, has agreed to appoint a British adviser who will be able, it is hoped, to ensure that the oil royalties are spent on sound development projects or suitably invested* 3. Social Conditions Mr. M.T. Audsley, Labour Adviser to the British Middle East Office, vial ted Qatar between 27th and 30th January, 1949, He points out in his report that social conditions in this State are entirely primitive (slavery still exists) and the ruling Sheikh has hitherto done nothing for his community. In this community the British Oil Company has now established itself, with a labour force of about 160 Europeans, nearly 500 Indians and over 2,000 Arabs. Considering how recently this Company has been set up, it provides a high standard of living for its employees. Wages are high, and the company supx^lies free food, medical services, and hut accommodation to the i-irab workers. The latter appear already to be deriving physical better ment from the Company's services.\ r\ VI KOWEIT !♦ General .Koweit lies at the north-v/est corner of the Gulf and is roughly a square 90 miles in each, direction indented hy a hay, t is hounded on the east by the sea, on the north and west * an J on s ? uth Saudi Arabia with a small area at the south-east which had not been ajjportioned either to Koweit or Saudi ^rabia and is described as a Neutral Zone. There is one town, Koweit, where the great majority of the live. The size of the town is estimated at 70,000; the total population is about 150,000. Apart from this there are only a few small villages. There are small gardens adjoining some of the villages, but generally speaking the bheikhdom consists of waterless desert. The rainfall averages from 5 to 6 inches a year and when there are a dequate and timely winter rains the desert affords good grazing and is visited by nomad tribes from Iraq and Saudi ^^abia. The population is much more truly Arab than that of ^ hr ? iT 5. but in Kowc i t tovm t horo are a number of Persians and a fi' lanB V The Sheikh rules personally with the assistance SL?^ er r f n * ere of his family. He has no British Advisers, health and education are under local committees onesided over by members of his family. , . ihe Koweit Oil Company, which is half British and half jjnerican, came into production in 1946 and its activities are rapidly expanding. Its head offices are in Koweit but a new camp is under construction 20 miles south at Ahmadi and the oil is shipped from Pahahil a few miles to the east ^ Ahmadi. There is a branch of the Imperial Bank of Iran at Koweit and Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie maintain an office there. npart from oil Kuweit’s economy is based upon its entreoort shipbuilding industry. It is the natural port ol N.E. Arabia and the Bedouin who visit it for grazing draw their imports through it, it is also a transhipment port for ,he produce of the smaller Gulf ports and of India. A motor road leads to Basra, and motorable tracks and camel routes to Bureida, Riyadh and the Hasa oasis, and a track to Qutif, Koweit is famous throughout the Gulf for shipbuilding craft (shows) for which the timber is imported from the Malabar coast. Its other main industry, that of pearling, has declined for the same reason os that of Bahrein. . to complete absence of water, there is no scope for agricultural development in Koweit. Drinking water is imported by country craft from the Shatt el-Arab. 2 . Employment of F a eign Exports , ThQ S l 1 Q f^ h of K ? woit Gm Ploys a British State Medical Officer and three British police inspectors. He is now endeavouring to recruit 3 more British doctors, a British matron, and two nurses. A number of non-British experts also employed, viz. an Egyptian Director of Education and teachers.of various Arab nationalities, mostly Egyptian and • ? ne German doctor, two Palestinian doctors and 20 Palestinian nurses; 15 Palestinian clerks and one are 60 P 0 lestinian police inspector. In/2 • In addition to a Financial adviser (see paragraph U below) ^ the Political agency at Koweit recommend that we should try and persuade the Sheikh to appoint a British police officer and two English teachers. Ihe salaries at present offered for British experts are adequate. (The State Medical Officer gets £3&gt;900 per annum plus free house and car). ' 3• Social D e velopment Mr. M.T. Audsley, Labour Adviser to the British Middle Bast Office, visited Kuweit in April, 1949&gt; and the following summarlsee his main impressions and comments. Thera-nid expansion jf the Company's production has transformed the internal economy of the country with consequent social repercussions. In January 1947&gt; ftor instance, the Company's labour force amounted to 1900 workers by January 1949 it had risen to over 18,000. Di-.ring the same period the number of Indians in the State rose from 236 to over 4&gt;000. Purchasing power has enormously increased; the shops are stocked with imported goods and the merchants are accumulating immense wealth. / The number of motor vehicles at Kuweit has increased from unaer 300 in 1946 , to over 3 &gt; 500 . ^s a result, thousands of ordinary people can satisfy their wants to a much gfeatcr extent than hitherto, and a form of social betterment has resulted. Whether this 'orderly chaos' os Mr. **.udsley describes it, can be turned into real social progress, will depend on (a) the good Intentions of the Sheikh and the extent to v/hich he has been induced to accept the help of British advisers, and (b) the example set by the Odl Oomoany in its labour and oocihl welfare policies. number of He has The one of the ixS regards (a), the Sheikh is now carryinr- out a development projects, described in paragraph 4 below, however, made no attempt to confcroiLthe cost of living, high cost of acoetunodation, for example, constitutes greatest hardships for the workers, and the Sheikh himself is the greatest beneficiary from this. All price controls except that on wheat (supplied by His Majesty s Government) have now been .removed. On the other hand, the high cost of living has resulted in correspondingly high wages from the Oil Company with a consequent increase in wealth to the State. xxS regards comments: (b), the following are Mr. ^udsley's chief (i) Wage rates paid by the Company to local labour are on the whole reasonable and fair. (ii) The Company is constructing a now tov/n at Ahmadi,, 20 miles south of Kuweit, for its British, Arabian and Indian staff. ii. new village will be constructed 'nearby for Arab employees. This will provide good housing and al± xorms of community and administrative needs. Meanwhile, living conditions for the workers are very unfavourable. (iii)/(iii) The company has at present a well- staffed hospital with 110 'beds and 4 dispensaries at Me&amp;ura* A new hospital is to be built at Ahmadi '.in 2 years 1 time# (iv) i». small training centre for ^^rab employees has been started. It is hoped that this -can be greatly expanded. (v) The labour department of the company is* inexperienced and needs strengthening. Two strikes occurred during Mp* Aadlsley f s short visit. 4* Development Policy Since oil production began in 1946, the Sheikh of Koweit has received oil royalties amounting to £ millions for 1947 and £1.5 millions for 1948. Receipts for 1949 are expected to amount to £3*6 millions. By 1958 they are estimated to be £15 millions* In addition he has received millions for his shore in the concession rights in the Neutral Zone, (this sum is believed to be lying intact in a New York Bank) and, when P^ocJ-uction starts, he will receive a minimum annual royalty ofpo millions. The Sheikh continues, however to live and think on the same lines as he has done for the past 28 years of his rule, and neither he nor his people realise the problems raised by their immense accession of wealth. The Sheikh*s policy is at present essentially conservative. The administrati is still of a most primitive kind; unlike Bahrein, there is no tradition of British advice and administration and our intex ference is, in fact, resented. Attempts which we have for some time been making to induce the Sheikh to appoint a British Financial .-idviser have thus met with no success* It is hoped now partially to remedy this deficiency by* the appointment of a British Financial and Commercial Secretary to the Residency at Bahrein, who will give a considerable amount of his attention to Koweit. Meanwhile, however, a substantial amount of development is taking place in an unplanned and haphazard way* New hospitals and schools are being built, a new rcr.d is being constructed from the customs wharf to the main square, and the Sheikh has at _last agreed to purchase a large distillation I&gt;lant to ensure an adequate supply of drinking water* His Majesty’s Political Resident considers that there is enough to be done in the way of improving the amenities of the town and its harbour and of providing public services to absorb the royalty income for the next few years at least* On the other hand, the Treasury representative in the Middle East has commented that 'even if it were wise to spend the total royalty income on projects in Kov/eit, it would be extremely difficult to spend such large sums in Kov/eit on projects which could be regarded as sound . A very substantial part of Koweit s total income from oil should be invested else where to provide an alternative permanent -income against the day v/hen royalties cease for any reason'. It is considered, however, that it would be premature to approach the Sheikh on this question now, and it is hoped that the new Financial Secretary to the Residency, will be able in due. course to raise the matter with him.Ship-ping In the Persian G-ulf The Ministry of Transports representative in India visited the Persian Gulf in July, 1949 and the following paragraphs are based on his report. 1. Shipping Service Shipping Services to and from the Persian Gulf have greatly expanded since 1939 as a result of Oil Company developments« There are two British Shipping Companies operating in the area: (i) The British Indian Steam Navigation Company, who provide the regular mail, passenger and cargo service between the Persian Gulf, Karachi and Bombay. A fast service calls every ten days (to be decreased next year to a week) at Bahrein and Kuwait. A slow service calls every 17/15 days at Gwadur, Muscat, Sharjah, Dubai, Bahrain and Kuwait. (This service is, however, very irregular and frequent complaints are made.) It is hoped to decrease this shortly to 12 days. This Company have also just started a regular monthly service between the Persian Gulf and the Par East, They also transport bitumen, grain and refrigerated cargo for the AIOO at Abadan. (ii) The Strick-Ellerman joint service provide a regular service between the U.K. and Continental ports as required, and the Persian Gulf. Most of the Anglo-IIranian imports of constructional material come from the U.K, and are carried entirely by this service to the extent of about 150,000 tons a year. About 40 ships, owned and chartered by the two companies, are at present employed on the service as opposed to about 15 before the war. There is no regular British service to and from America, but Strick-Ellerman put on special ships to the U.S.A during the date season. The Misr Navigation Company has a monthly cargo and passenger service to and from the Mediterranean via the West coast of India, Aden, the Red Sea and Egypt. There are a Iso a number of American and Dutch shipping lines and one Swedish line, running regular services to the Gulf. The two former are competing hard with our own companies, and are apparently willing to call anywhere for any cargo in obviously unremunerative quantities in order break into the trade. In the face of this competition, the British lines are doing their best to increase the efficiency of their services, and to provide new ships when required*, The reputation of British shipping with the larger and more important customs is reported to be 'Quite good', but there have been complaints from the smaller customers. So far 3.1. have been unwilling to include small places like Gwadur and Muscat in the schedule of the fast mail service, except occasionally, since this should / involveinvolve strictly a limiting cargo for Bahrain and Kuwait. There is at present no local coaster service apart from the B.I. service. The main difficulties with which the lines are confronted are greatly increased expenses since 1939, principally on account of fuel and repairs, (as a result, in July, 1949 fares on the B.I. Persian Gulf Service were raised 29 %) and much slower handling of cargo, particularly at Bombay. A further handicap is the inadequate port facilities in the Gulf, (see 2 below). 2. Port facilities Most of the so-called ports in the Persian Gulf are merely open roadsteads. Lighterage from ocean vessels lying at anchor, in some cases several miles from the shore, is far from an ideal method of handlingttho heavy types of cargo which are now arriving at ports serving the oil companies. In most cases, however, the cost of building piers would probably be prohibitive, and a better solution of the problem of loss and damage to cargoes through pilferage and badhandling will probably be an a ttempt to provide a more prompt and efficient lighter service with stricter personal supervision by competent foremen. Those oil companies which are expecting to import large quantities of material in the next few years are constructing new jetties both for discharging dry cargo and for loading tankers at several points in the Gulf; for example, the Iraq Petroleum Company have already started operations from Umm Said on the eastern side of the Qatar peninsular. The Bahrain Petroleum Company have used jetties and anchorages at Sitra on the eastern side of the island, while B.I. still use the old anchorages which are nearer to the town. The Kuwait Oil Company are constructing a new port at Mena A 1 Ahmadi. All these new works, i.e. jetties for discharging cargo and buoys for loading tankers, constructed at the oil companies 1 expense, will remain the oil companies T property. .In some cases they propose to provide all the facilities themselves; at others, e.g, at Sitra, they will continue to employ Gray Mackenzie* s lighterage services. Kuwait, indeed, should for practical purposes be regarded as two separate ports since cargo consigned to the Kuwait Oil Company is handled, lighted and landed entirely separately from that consigned to merchants in the city. The lighters are under separate ownership and the landing-points some 3 miles apart. The oil company has its own barges and tugs whereas general cargo for the port is handled by the Kuwait Landing Company, a local concern to whom the Sheikh has granted a monopoly. There are general complaints about the slowness and inefficiency of this company, and every few months, after mismangement hasbecome too glaring, the Sheikh is induced to intervene, after Which there is a slight improvement for a time. Grey, Mackenzie and Company have a tug and lighter fleet of 60 craft. They plan to build an up-to-date workshop and slipway at Bahrain for repairs of all the small craft of their own and the neighbouring oil companies. The Sheikh of Bahrain has offered to lease a site which is now being examined, on the west side of the Muharraq causeway bridge. The British Resident considers that this is a project which should be warmly supported.vm ■anji-Locust work in Trucicil Oman t too,, + n ' the early s P ri ng of 1949 new swarms of the Desert P°?ty s rnt e bv I ’?hp C p d ^w the p TrUCial ? man * whore G field „ nZY+fh Pa ^i s ' tan Government and later assisted by dpni mi+vJ +vJ rt fl ' om the De sert Locust Survey were unable to th f® on a sufficient scale.

Report by Mr, Burrows of the Foreign Office after his tour of the Persian Gulf in May 191+97 (a) Kuwait , There has been a rapid growth of primary education in the last year or two. This now covers some 2 # 000 boys and l f 000 girls. The teachers are largely Egyptian and Palestine Arabs, There are also some local teachers. There are only 60 children receiving secondary education. Great difficulty 1 is found in obtaining candidates for secondary education because comparatively lucritive jobs in the Oil Company and in business are available to those with even the rudiments of education which they can obtain at the primary schools. There are some 90 students from Kuwait at Cairo University, The Egyptian Director of Education has said that it was his ambition to make Kuwait a centre of religious education in the Middle East. The Minister of Education has said he would consider the possibility of appointing an English teacher to teach in the Secondary School, particularly with a view to preparing Kuwait students for higher education in England or America. The Kuwait Oil Company have started to give extremely elementary teaching to a few of their local workers. It is not considered that there is any prospect of getting a British expert employed by the Kuwait Company at any high level in their educational organisation. The main requirement at Kuwait seems to be that the Kuwait Oil Company should rapidly increase its interest in local education# The best method seems to be that the Company should concentrate on technical training and specialised education. They should begin with an apprentice scheme by which they would engage boys as young as possible and pay them as ordinary employees but in fact arrange for them to spend half their time receiving intensive training in work which they could subsequently for the Company, thus replacing Indians and eventually Europeans, The most promising apprentices could be sent to engineering and other establishments in the IL.K, and America to complete their training. Others might be sent to the /imerican University at Beirut if there were suitable courses there for them. It is for consideration whether the K.O.C, should contribute to general education in Kuwait. There might be advantage from the point of view of their general relations with Kuwait if they offered a few scholarships at the American University at Beurit or in the U,K, and America for general purposes not connected with the Company's work but it is oonwidered that on the whole general education should be the function of the state. / (b) Bahrein .(t&gt;) Bahrein f (luca ' tionG l facilities have been progressively increased an +- S e P 1 * 0 ^ 0 -™ 6 for future developments seems relatively satisfactory in relation to the size and needs of the population. There are about 3,000 children in Primary Schools. The Secondary School has about 100 students, some of whom are receiving special teacher’s training. The Director of Education used to be British but when the post became vacant we were unable to supply a new candidate and after some delay a Bahraini v/as appointed. He has some Egyptian and Palestinian Arab teachers under him. The Secondary School is combined with a hostel where boys from outlying villages and in some cases from other parts of the Persian Gulf, live in somewhat the same conditions as in a boarding school in this country. There is quite a possibility of the appointment of a British teacher of English for the Secondary School. ^ An attempt was made to send students for higher •' education to Cairo in the same way as is done from Kuwait but after a very short expereince of this arrangement it was xound that the Bahraini students were imbibing undesirable political ideas and they were recalled. A number of Bahrainis are now at the American University at Beirut whore some of them receive teachers’ training. The Bahrain Petroleum Company has just obtained approval from its ^ead Office to offer a number of scholarships to the American University at Beirut. It is also intended to send 4 Bahraini students to Nottingham University this year for a teachers training course. If this experiment is successful further students will°be sent in future. In Bahrain as in Kuwait one of the greatest difficulties is to persuade both boys and girls to continue their education long enough. Moreover, the teaching profession is not popular as compared with work in the Oil Company and other kinds of business. ^ ? -^ahrain 1 etroleum Company appear to have shown rather little interest in the education of local employees until quite recently, Nov/, however, the local manager o-ives the impression of being fully convinced of the great importance of training Bahrainis to fit them for higher grades of work in the Company. £he Company have organised general classes tor some of their employees and have some rather haphazard arrangements for training apprentices. My impression is that they could well intensify this work and start at an earlier age More could be done in the direction of advanced apprentice or training courses in the U.K. and U.S.A. Lc) Qatar and the Trucial Coast. Owing to the complete absence of education in Qatar and on the Trucial Coast serious consideration should be ’given to the possibility of progressively using Bahrain as the educational centre for these areas until they are able to set up educational facilities oi their own. There would be some / politicalpolitical difficulty in the case of Qatar owing to the feud between the two Rulers* If this difficulty proves insurrnountable urgent consideration v/ill have to be given to the needs of Qatar for education since there is already a large influx of workers there and this will rapidly increase over the next few years* The same v/ill take place at a somewhat later stage in some parts of the Trucial Goast, notably Abu Dhabi and Dubai where oil is almost certain to be worked fairly soon. We must try to make sure that these places go the way of Bahrain rather than the way of Kuwait* (&amp;) Muscat. There is one Arab Primary School, the teachers including Palestinian Arabs, There are other schools for some of the Indian and Persian inhabitants who form the great majority of the population of the town of Muscat, Higher education is only obtainable in individual cases. The Sultan has asked for the services of some more Palestinian Arab teachers, particularly for Dhofar. There seems to be practically no provision for the education of the very numerous inhabitants of the Batinah Coast or for the large Bedouin population of the interior. The State has no money with v/hich to provide any large extension of education. It is open to question whether Muscat should look for its higher education in the direction of Karachi, Bahrain or Aden (or possibly even Khartoum). On the whole the most useful channel would seem to be towards Bahrain and the American University at Beirut. (e) General * One of the most urgent requirements seems to be that the younger members of ruling families throughout the Gulf should obtain satisfactory education. At present one member of the Bahrain ruling family is at university in America, having- failed to obtain admittance to universities in the U.K. 'The son of the Sultan of Muscat will probably go shortly to the American College at Damaefcus. Otherv/ise nothing in this direction is being done. It is su gested that a serious effort should be made to have one or more members of each Ruling Family, including as many as possible of the Trucial Coast Cheikhs, sent to receive a good Arabic and if possible later English education outside the Persian Gulf. If the American College at Damascus is a really satisfactory institution for this purpose this might be best as a first stage until any of them are proficient enough at English to go to Victoria College at Alexandira or Cairo. While the present demand for all kinds of labour by the Oil Companies continues there is unlikely to be much danger of the creation by unsuitable methods of education of a class of unemployed effendis such as has poisoned the political and educational atmosphere in Egypt and Iraq. But this is a danger which must always be borne very clearly in mind. It is most likely to arise in Kuwait. A progressive increase in opportunities for technical education in the Oil Companies will do something to minimise the danger. / 2^ Action■MB2• Action taken on Mr. Burrow^ Report: The British Council ha e made provision in their Iraq budget for periodical tours by the Council Representative in Iraq and the Director of the British Institute in Basra to the Persian Gulf territory to advise local schools and authorities on educational matters. The Council have also increased their financial provision (administered by Sir R. Hay) for assistance to local education from £50 in the current year to £500 in 1950/51 (despite drastic economies in their overall budget) and have allocated £.648 for two new scholarships in the United Kingdom to date from October 1950,GENERAL POLICY REGARDING UTILISATION OF OIL ROYALTY RECEIPTS Extract from a Report* dated June 19U9. by the Treasury Representative in the Middle East. Of the Gulf States, Kuwait seems to he the only one likely in the near future to have substantial funds in excess of what can be used locally on sound economic projects. But for reasons stated in Para VI above, any approach to the Sheikh at this stage to invest in some form of Middle East Development Corporation would probably be premature. Apart from the suggested utilisation of the overall surpluses of the Gulf Statesj in development projects in the Middle East generally and canalised through some Agency, the following points are for consideration: (i) If there is any way such surpluses can be utilised other than through a Middle East Development Corporation, (ii) What can be done to mop up purchasing power created by local expenditure by the oil companies and by the amounts pumped into the Sheikhdoms through local expenditure financed out of oil royalties. Point (i) is a question of capital formation and preservation while (ii) is a question of income consumption. The overall surpluses from the capital of the particular Sheikhdom and in one form or another should be preserved as capital. They should be converted to other forms of capital if by so doing an alternative revenue to oil royalties will result. But there are many other forms of expenditure which should be undertaken but which do not by themselves produce a money income, i.e. schools, hospitals, clinics, sanitation measures, all legitimate causes for expenditure of royalties. When completed these projects will provide something of great value to the Sheikhdoms but no income - or very little. After construction and establishment they will be a permanent burden i on the State*s Budget for salaries, wages, equipment, etc. If Budget income ceases through a cessation of oil royalties such social services may have to close down. On the other hand, when capital funds are at present available it would be wrong to fail to proceed with the building of schools, hospitals etc, merely because of 'risk of oil royalty income failing. As a solution to this problem it is suggested that we should persuade the Sheikhs to cover the risk of utilisation of their capital surpluses. Whenever a school or a hospital or any other worthy but non-revenue producing object is sanctioned, funds should be allocated rot only for the actual building of schools, hospitals etc. and their installation equipment, but in addition a capital sum to be invested in British Government securities to producean income sufficient to cover the estimated annual recurring expenses of the particular institution. Such capital sums to be allocated to specific objects and schemes and administered by a Trust. This policy of endowment has several virtues 1. It will preserve intact but in different form the annual patrimony from oil. 2. It absorbs surpluses faster than otherwise would be possible. 3» It avoids the risk of closing down of social betterment schemes through loss of revenue. 4« It lessens the risk of wild-cat spending through possession of too much money* It will tend to develop a civic sense in the Sheikhdoms• As regards point (ii) above - income consumption - this is best met by the import of consumer goods on as large a scale as possible and by taxation. However difficult it may be to persuade the Sheikhs to impose taxation on the rich - they will of course take the line that oil will produce all the revenue they need* therefore, why tax - we should nevertheless make the attempt. As the administration of the Sheikhdoms is not of a quality as would make direct taxation practicable* a steeply graded Custom Duty on luxury imports might well be the first step to be followed by other forms of indirect taxation. The entry of consumption goods in the Sheikhdoms - particularly Bahrein and Kuwait - has improved considerably over the past year or so ; in fact in some lines there is evidence of saturation point having been reached. In other lines, however* there is scope for a very great increase in British exports. Electrical goods, cars, bicycles, pumps, telephone equipment etc., are only a few of the items in which British trade could participate with advantage. To achieve this objective British traders should pay much more attention to the potentialities of the Gulf than they appear to do at the present time. The Commercial Secretary who is to be appointed to the Residents staff should be able to promote this export trade. The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf is inclined to disagree with Mr. Weight* s suggestion that the Rulers should be pressed to increase their customs tariffs. He points out that some of Sheikhdoms owe their prosperity very largely to their low customs tariffs.PERSIAN GULF CURRENCY At the present time, both the Indian and Pakistani rupees are in use in the Persian Gulf area, the former being predominant* Neither currency, however, has legal tender status and there is therefore no official currency as such in the area. The predominance of the Indian rupee derives from the days when the Indian G-overnment was responsible for the administration of the Gulf States, and when trade between India and the Gulf was to a large extent complementary. Trade however is now tending to shift steadily away from India. In addition, the changed political situation in the continent of India has led the Gulf States to regard the Indian rupee with less assurance than hitherto, and there is some feeling at present pervading, not only unfavourable to the Indian rupee, but to some extent favourable to the idea of a separate currency for the Gulf Sheikhdoms. In face of this, earlier suggestions that the Indian rupee might be declared the official Gulf currency seem to be impracticable; but on the other hand there are political difficulties with India in the way of introduction of a separate currency, and no change is to be expected in the immediate future in the traditional uce of the l^wo. rupees./XIV TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND POSTAL FACILITIES IN THE PERSIAN OULF There are the following telegraph offices:- (a) Messrs. Cable and Wireless - MANAMAH (in Bahrein), KUWEIT and MUSCAT. (b) International Aeradis - SHARJAH. (c) Pakistan Government - GWADUR. (It is not apparently clear v/hether this station is functioning)• POST OFFICES:- BAHREIN, DUBAI (including SHARJAH), KUWEIT and MUSCAT. The Pakistan Government operate Post Offices at - GWADUR and PASNI. There are no projects in the telecommunication or postal field in prospect in this area.XXII. Civil Aviation in tho Persian Gulf Article 2 of the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation defines the territory of a state as the land areas 'under the sovereignty, suzerainty, protection or mandate of such state'. The Sheikhdoms of Bahrein, Kuwait, Qatar and the Trucial Oman are therefore considered United Kingdom territory for the purposes of international civil aviation; and traffic between them and the United Kingdom is considered cabotage. In addition, civil air agreements have been, or are being, concluded wi-fh the more important of the Sheikhs, under which His Majesty s Government acquire the sole right to establish and maintain airfields in the territories, and to grant to foreign aircraft the privilege of exercising traffic rights. 2, With the development of the oil communities, there has arisen in the Gulf territories a very considerable demand for air transport facilities to Europe and the United States, and this demand is likely to increase in the future. All the major trunk operators are anxious to share in the traffic, which they regard as likely to be extremely lucrative. The regional operators of the adjacent Middle East countries moreover want to take advantage of the need which has now arisen for local services between the Gulf and adjacent territories, for the carriage both of freight and personnel. 3« The major problem is the unsatisfactory condition of the airfields. The most important are Bahrein, Koweit and Sharjah. At Bahrein, the airfield is jointly used by the R.A.F, and civil operators. The runway is sufficiently strong to take heavy aircraft, but some of the ancilliary facilities and the civil organisation generally are inadequate. Steps are being taken to remedy them. The present airfield at Koweit is deteriorating rapidly. The Koweit Oil Company intend to build a new airfield for their own use, and M.C.A. are considering the desirability of His Majesty s Government bearing the additional expense required to bring it up to international standards suitable for long range operators. There is a danger of our running into political difficulties with the Americans and others if we have to continue to refuse use of the airfield to other operators on the grounds of its inadequacy while we use it ourselves. Sharjah airfield is not of a high standard though adequate for R.A.F. staging purposes, and is in any case too far from the main traffic centres. 4. At the moment the only regular services calling at the territories are the B.O.A.C. services from the United Kingdom to Bahrein and Koweit, and the local services of the Iraqi Airways and Iranian Airways. When the airfield problem has been resolved the necessary permits will be given for other operators also to instituto services. There is a considerable amount of non-scheduled flying, largely by aircraft on charter to the Oil Companies.RECOMMENDATION3 Bahrein. 1. We should continue to urge the Sheikh to appoint an Assistant British Adviser to Mr. Belgrave. 2. We should encourage the Bahrein Government to implement Sir Herbert Stewards recommendations regarding agricultural development• 3- We should continue to urge the Bahrein Petroleum Company to expand the technical training services which it is providing for the Bahrein State. 4. We should urge the Bahrein Petroleum Company to adopt a more liberal attitude over oil royalties. 5* We should continue to advise the Government of Bahrein to develop the town of Manamah as a business and holiday centre. Muscat . 6. We should advise and assist the Purchasing Agent to the Sultan of Muscat in his plans for the establishment of an agency for the development of Muscat Fisheries. 7. We should advise and assist the Puschasing Agent to the Sultan of Muscat in his plans for the promotion of date production in the Sultanate. 8. We should encourage the Sultan of Muscat to implement Mr. Hartley* s report on agricultural development in Dhufar. 9* We should advise the Sultan of Muscat regarding the desirability (or otherwise) of establishing cement and chemical industries in Dhufar on the lines recommended by Sir Cyril Fox. 10. We should encourage the Sultan of Muscat to develop health and education services. 11. We should assist the Sultan of Muscat to recruit three fisheries officers, three medical officers, and an agricultural officer for Dhufar, and if it proves desirable to appoint British experts to these posts, we should, if necessary, consider the possibility of loaning such officers from His Majesty’s Government. Kuweit . 12. We should where possible assist the Sheikh of Kuweit to recruit the British experts which he reouires.13 • We should continue to encourage the Kuweit Oil Company: (a) to press ahead with the provision of accommodation for its native labour; (b) to expand its technical training facilities, and (c) to strengthen its Labour Relations Department*. General 14. We should encourage the Sheikhdoms which have substantial oil revenues - i*e. Bahrein, Kuweit, Qatar - to prepare an overall long term development programne, which should be carefully balanced in the light of available financial resources, and of the requirements of the State, between (a) Revenue producing capital development projects - power stations, harbours, etcetera and (b) Non-revenue producing capital development projects - schools, hospitals, etcetera. The programme might include provision for the endowments of certain projects under (b). 15 # We should consider the desirability of establishing some form of Middle East Development Corporation with British participation in which oil revenue surplus to the requirements described in paragraph 14 could be invested and utilised for development in other areas of the Middle East. 16. We should encourage the Sheikhs of Bahrein, Kuweit, and Qatar to introduce higher taxation(in the form of either direct taxation, or of increased Customs duties) in order to mop up the purchasing power created by the new oil wealth. 17. The Ministry of Transport should discuss with the British India Steam Navigation Company and with the Strick- Ellerman Lines the possibilities of improving British shipping services in the Persian Gulf. 18. The Ministry of Transport should discuss with Gray, Mackenzie &amp; Company and with the Oil Companies the possibilities of improving the limiter services in the Persian Gulf. 19. We should contribute as fully as our resources permit to the Anti-Locust Campaign in Oman which the recent Desert Locust Conference at Karachi has recommended should be carried out as a aombined operation by the Governments of the United Kingdom, India, Pakistan and Persia. 20. We should consider the possibility of offering the services of a British water expert to the Governments of Bahrein and Muscat and to the Trucial Sheikhdoms in order to investigate and report on the utilisation of water supplies.ANl\iEX I, Agriculture in Bahrein Summary of Report, dated March 1949, hy Sir Herbert Stewart, Agricultural Adviser to the British Middle East Office. The main island of Bahrein has an area of 231 square miles. However, since there is an annual average rainfall of only 2-^ inches, agriculture plays a very minor part in fhe economy of the island, and only 11 square miles are cultivated. Cultivation is concentrated in a narrow strip along the North coast and extends for a few miles down the East and West coasts. Date growing is the basis of the country’s agriculture, but the introduction of artesian wells has permitted also the growing of lucerne, vegetables, and some fruit. The quality of the crops produced is variable. The plantations are usually owned by Sheikhs, and worked either by direct labour; or else leased, usually for a period of two years. Irrigation. There are three sources of irrigation: (a) Natural springs. (b) Lift irrigation from wells. (c) Artesian wells. These have only been developed in the last fifteen years and are all within, or close to, the area in the north of the island, already irrigated by natural springs and wells. In the rest of the Island, water is too brackish or too scarce to be of any use. Prospects of Development. (a) The limiting factor in the Island is, of course, the water supply. Better use of this may be made in the following ways:- (i) a reduction in volume of irrigation applied to existing plantations. It is said that heavy irrigation has been applied in order to wash the salts out of the soil. However, eventually the salts will have been leached out of the soil and there is no reason why such heavy irrigation should continue. (ii) Water which has been drained away from irrigated land and which is suitable for further irrigation, i.e. not salted up, should be put to the fullest possible use and not, as is sometimes the case, drained away and lost, (iii) Using land in the existing date plantations more fully by filling up gaps between trees and by inter—planting with fruit and other crops. /wFI- 2 - (b) More water could be supplied but this is only possible by further sinking of artesian wells* However, limitations of the total underground supply have been proved within the last ten years, and it has been found necessary to restrict the sinking of new artesian wells* Therefore, if more wells are sunk, great care must be taken that the water is not merely taken from other adjoining wells. (c) Since there is not much prospect of extending the area of land under cultivation, and since Bahrein is very largely dependent on imports of food, agriculture should concentrate on highly paying, intensive crops, such as fruit, vegetables, greed fodder, chillies, tobacco and sugar# (a) The date plantations may be capable of expansion and the quality of the trees can be improved* (e) Scope for increasing the quantity of livestock in the Island is limited by the supply of foodstuffs, but selective breeding should be undertaken to improve the quality# u) There is a State Agriculture Garden of about 35 acres under the direction of an Egyptian officer# This should be run on more scientific lines and used for experimentation, research, and the production of cheap nursery plants.AMKEX II Development of fisheries at Muscat and Oman Fisheries of the Arab ina ■p. Sultan of Muscat and Oman commissioned Dr. G. u. L. Bertram of St. John's College, Cambridge, to carry.out a survey of the fisheries. Dr. Bertram visited the January and February of 1948 and his report was published by the Sultan in the following May. The following notes are based on his Report: e The existing fisheries are operated by extremely primitive and wasteful methods. Nevertheless, they provide an important part of the production of the Sultanate and also support a large export trade. The Gulf of Oman is fished all the year round. The south coast (Dhufar) cannot be fished from June to September owing to the monsoon. There are two kinds of fishing. (1) Sand fishing. This is operated from the shore and from palm frond boats with laboriously woven nets and the chief catch is sardines. (2) Rock fishing. This is operated from dug-out canoes and with hook and line, and the fish caught is chiefly shark and tunnies. 8 ' 2) The main products’ (i) S ardines : These are dried on the beach and stored in pits or in primitive store-houses. When oil is extracted it is clone oimply by allowing heaps of sardines to rot on the ground and then collecting the resulting oil, in the main sardines are used for human consumption, for animal fodder, and for manure. Oil is extracted only on the south coast. (ii) - Sharks^ and _tunnies . These are split and salted - wet or dry - and used for human food. (iii) Minor prod ucts and by-products. Some of these are of high value and include varlcTfe kinds of fish which are good to eat but which only form a small proportion of the catch. Various kinds of molluscs, and shark fins, which are exported to China, fish bones and fish meal etc. Estimated Annual Catch The total annual catch (wet) is estimated by Dr. Bertram to be 100,000 tons, of which about 40,000 are exported, and the remainder used by the local inhabitants or wasted. /Summary/(iii) Summany of main products exported 12k§.zJ£kZ (including Gwadur bat excluding Dhufar) Product Tons Value per Ton Total Va'. Dry sardines 8,000 £11 £88,000 Salted fish 200 £47 £ 9,400 Dry fish (misc) 300 £83 £24,900 Misc. products 270 £92 £24.840 Total £147.140 Figures for products consumed locally are more difficult to obtain but the export figures given an idea of the richness of the fishery. The organisation of exports, storage, etc. is undertaken by only one firm, that of Haji Backer Abdul Latif Fazul. Otherwise, collection, storage and exports are completely unorganised* 3. Possibilities of Development It is obvious therefore that there are extremely good chances of developing the fisheries in the Sultanate. There are, however, a number of disadvantages, (a) The *:fishermen are extremely primitive and uneducated and it ‘would be difficult to convert them into a modern and progressive community. (b) The Sultanate is extremely remote from markets, (c) The hot climate prevents export in any other form than dried or salted fish. Taking this into consideration, development might be pursued along the following lines: (i) Elimination of Waste Dr. Bertram says that up to 25 ? 0 of fish stored is consumed by insects. Improved methods of preservation, better store-houses and the use of insecticide should enormously increase the quantity of fish that could be marketed. (ii) Sardine Oil Sardine Oil which is extracted from rotting heaps on the southern coast should be of much higher quality and greater quantity if a simple press could be used. Moreover, the oil could be extracted from all sardines destined for manure with benefit to the soil, whereas at present sardines are thrown on to the ground without the oil being extracted. When used as fodder, sardines would be slightly inferior in nutritional value if the oil had been extracted from them.(iii) Shark liver oil At present this is only collected for oiling the bottoms of boats. The oil might provide high grade citamin A. But it would be extremely difficult to collect the shark livers and organise the production of oil. In addition samples so far taken have not been encouraging. (iv) Fishing methods There is room for vast improvement. Demonstration and help to the fishermen would at first be received suspiciously but if good results were obtained^ advance along these lines should be possible. In particular there is need for preserving nets. (v) Canning The firm of Haji Bacher Abdul Latif Fazul should be encouraged to install a small canning plant* It is not yet certain whether this would be economically feasible but investigation and experiment might be undertaken. (vi) Refrigeration There are possibilities of refrigation, but it is extremely doubtful whether the products so stored would be appreciated and the cost involved is likely to be too great to make the venture worth while* It is not considered that the project offers much hope at its present stage, of providing high-class fish products for Europeans. But it can provide cheap products for India and the Colonies and so indirectly ease the situation in Britain. (vii) The ultimate objective is to discover the maximum catch that would be possible without seriously depleting stocks of fish and to exploit fisheries up to that point. The first and most promising field for development seems to be in the elimination of waste. When this has been done methods can be improved by degrees and as a longer-term policy a fishing industry of modern lines might prove worth while. However, the first care must always be that the local supply of fish which is vitally needed for food, animal fodder said manure, should be maintained since it is vital for the welfare of the peoples of Muscat and Oman.. 4. Summary o f Dt. Bertram’s r ecommendations (a) The State of Muscat and Oman should employ, say, three paid fisheries officers. (b) Proper methods of net preservation should be domonstrated and encouraged. (c) Use of insecticides should be introduced.0 (d) A boiler and press for extraction of sardine oil should be set up at some point in Dhufar* (e) Storage of sardines in pits should be discouraged. (f) Improved fishing methods, based on local experiment, should be gradually introduced. (g) The firm of Haji Backer Abdul Latif Pazul might become an important instrument of the State for the development of the fisheries. (h) Statistics of the catch and its destination should be collected. (i) Taxation of fish trade is perhaps better undertaken through direct export Tax. (j) u Khors' in Dhufar (semi-salt lakes) might be farmed to produce fish during the monsoon. (k) Salt fish might be collected and stored for the local population’s use during the Monsoon in Dhufar. o) Some organisation might be encouraged to set up a canning factory. (rn) Foreign interests or firms should be encouraged to undertake development of the sultanates’ fisheries. The sultanate might offer to such interests the legal ownership of fishing within 3-mile territorial limits and shore facilities; on the other hand, an undertaking must be given that the vital needs of the local economy in fish for food fodder and manure should be satisfied. (n) Eventually the biology of the fish must be studied. (o) At a later stage only can power-driven craft be introduced. (p) Coir rope would be made if an expert could be obtained to set up a rope walk.ANNEX III Agricultural Development in the Dhufai* Province Mr. Hartley, Director of Agriculture at Aden visited the /-Province of Dhufar in November at the request of the Sultan. This Province is remarkable for the climatic advantages Y/hich it enjoys over any other part of South Arabia of similar elevation, since it has a true monsoonal climate. In his report Mr. Hartley makes the following recommendations for development:- 1 $ Irrigation Development The irrigated area in the coastal plain (the Jurbaid) is at present about 1,200 acres, supplied with water from about 200 wells. Crops grown include cotton (used chiefly for fish nets), wheat, cocoanuts, sugar cane and bananas. Mr, Hartley considers that by sinking further wells and drawing on the waters of five perennial streams and of a large fresh water pool, this area could be expanded to 4,000 acres. The works required involve the tapping of spring flows, the lining of canals and the construction of a diversion weir on one of the streams. It is estimated that these would take four years. The State Engineer (Mr. Pradhan Singh) has already put some of these works in hand. 2, Su^ar Production The Sultan especially asked Mr. Hartley’s advice on the possibilities of developing a sugar industry. Mr. Hartley suggests that when the irrigated area has been expanded to 4,000 acres, 500 acres should be intensively cropped to sugar cane and that a small modern state-run factory might be set up which from this acreage could produce a thousand tons of sugar a year. Even if sold at world prices (and the price at Dhufar is at present 3 times the world price), this production would bring in a substantial revenue to the State. The price of such a factory, Including some five miles of light railway track which would be required is estimated at about £ 150 , 000 . Mr. Hartley recommends that a sugar cane plant breeder should be engaged to select suitable varieties and test them out during the next four years while the irrigation development is being carried out. When the factory has been set up a sugar chemist and a plant breeder should be engaged, 3« Live stock improvements Mr. Hartley recommends:- (a) the introduction of a satisfactory breed of draft oxen for ploughing, inter-cultivation and haulage on the Jurbaid Plain; and (b) the improvement of the fine herds of cattle which are owned by the tribes in the Qara mountains by better management and breeding. Selected animals for breeding could be obtained from the Aden Protectorate. 4# Farming in the Qara Mountains . Mr. Hartley recommends:— the introduction of terracing on the hill-sides, as is done in the Aden Protectorate. He suggests that / an (a)^ an agricultural inspector from the Protectorate should he en'gaged to d emonstrate the method of terracing; and (h) the development of citrus and the introduction of the carab bean and the mesquit in this area. He suggests that planting material of citrus varieties could be imported by air from Eritrea. The Sultan is now. trying to engage a Palestinian agricultural officer for Dhufar Province. When this officer 1 has been appointed, he will presumably be charged with the execution of Mr. Hartley^ recommendations.ANNEX IV goal in Oman In 1901, Mr. R.D. Oldham, Superintendent of Geological Survey of India, visited Oman to investigate coal outcrops south of Sur, and drew up a report on his findings, dated the 3rd December, 1901. It appears that there is an outcrop of about ten miles in length in rocks of the Tertiary Age. Three localities were visited: (1) Musweh. Here were found eighteen seams of coal, two of them over four feet thick. However, not far off in rocks of the same strat&amp;no seams of coal were visisble at all. It appears therefore that the coal consists merely of pockets varying in thickness and limited in extension, and which would not be much use, except to provide coal for local purposes from surface workings. (2) At Jebel Khami, a couple of thin bands of coal were observed, but they were evidently as inconstant as the Musweh coal. (3) At Migel there was a good exposure of nice-looking coal. There v/ere throo ooal seams but again the width of them was variable. The biggest of these, originally discovered by Doctor Von Krafft, is described as follows 'Von Krafft's coal seam, though more extensive than those at Musweh, thins out at a short distance. The exposure seems to indicate, however, that there may be an area of as much as a quarter of a milo square, with a thickness of four feet or more. This gives some 250,000 tons of workable coal. This would certainly be worked if it were found in an easily accessible region, where there was a good demand; and once mining works were established, doubtless other similar patches of coal would be discovered, and so a moderate supply kept up for many years.' However, there are a number of difficulties to the development of this coal. The field is some 26 miles from Sur and 30 from Khor Jerama, and a railway would have to be built to one of these small ports, and port facilities provided. There is no local demand and the area is desert, so that labour, food, water, timber etc., would all have to be imported. A large capital outlay would be needed and this could only be justified if a good return were assured. Consequently, the Government of India, in 1901, pronounced that the development of this coal was not economic and decided not to proceed further in the matter. Today, hov/ever, interest in those Coal deposits appears to be reviving. The local tribesmen are being encouraged by the Administration to permit the investigation and development of the coal by being offered a good price for every bag brought into Sury130-1 B THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT CONFIDENTIAL (17781) E •*29/1056/91 E Xi- 8294 ARABIA June 8, 1949 Section 1 161 ARAB SHEIKHDOMS OF THE PERSIAN GULF Summary and Conclusions The attached paper attempts to give a survey of the Arab sheikhdoms of the Persian Gulf and some of their problems, with indications of the action which may be necessary there. The following is a short summary :— The Persian Gulf is an area of great importance to His Majesty’s Government. Our position in the Arab sheikhdoms has suffered somewhat because we have been slow in keeping up with changing develop ments there, notably the discovery and exploitation of oil resources with all the changes that this has brought. Koweit is a thriving boom town with all the advantages and dangers of such a con dition. It is also the territory most exposed to possibly undesirable external political influences. So far, though in a disorganised and wasteful way, the vast new resources of the State have not been too unwisely used. But much closer guidance from us will be required to ensure the stability and proper development of the territory in future. Bahrein is, in con trast, static and well administered, the chief dangers being that the Administra tion may not keep pace with changing trends of thought on social questions and with the development of political conscious ness among the inhabitants. Qatar is an embryo Koweit in miniature. We must “exert our influence at an earlier stage than we did in the case of Koweit to see that development proceeds on the right lines. In the Trucial Coast and Muscat we and rulers friendly to us have hitherto exer cised influence only from the sea and a very short distance inland. The renewal of an intensive slave trade and the development of oil resources in the interior make it essential that this influence should now be extended much further inland. Oil development will present many new problems in the Trucial Coast itself with which we must be prepared to deal at an early stage. The rulers of Muscat are faced with the difficult problem of extend ing their authority over the whole of the territory which nominally belongs to them, but in much of which the inhabitants do not owe them any practical allegiance. There are interesting development possi bilities in Muscat which we hope may be exploited with our co-operation. A separate paper is attached on educa tion in the Persian Gulf, which in itself presents many problems and possibilities. Eastern Department, Foreign Office. Sth June, 1949. Enclosure 1 The Arab Sheikhdoms of the Persian Gulf A Brief Survey I have just returned from a visit of about a fortnight to the Persian Gulf, and I believe it may be useful to set down a general impression of what the Gulf is like and some of its problems, based on experience of dealing with them at the Foreign Office for the past twelve months, and personal impressions during my visit. 2. I visited Bahrein, Koweit, Qatar, Sharjah, Dibai and Muscat. I talked to all members of the Residency and agency staffs, the Sheikhs of Bahrein, Koweit and Qatar and other members of their families, the Sultan of Muscat, the local representa tives of the Koweit Oil Company (K.O.C.), the Bahrein Petroleum Company, Petroleum Concessions (Limited) (a subsidiary of the Iraq Petroleum Company (I.P.C.)) and the American Independent Oil Company. I also spoke to large numbers of other British and American residents, including particu larly Mr. Belgrave, adviser to the Sheikh of Bahrein, and Mr. Woods Ballard, Minister for Foreign Affairs to the Sultan of Muscat. I was told that I was the first visitor from a Whitehall Department ever2 to have visited Muscatjtha T racial Coast and Qatar. i 3. It is difficult to generalise about an area which contains such a wide range of physical, ethnological, economic and administrative conditions. The potential riches of the area are well known. Most of these are only in a very preliminary stage of development. One of the main long-term problems is how these riches are to be developed in a manner which best takes account of the needs of all classes of the population and for the benefit of each State as a whole. It is probably too opti mistic to believe that there can be effective sharing of wealth between different parts of the area. The form of government is in varying degrees patriarchal. The administration, except in Bahrein, is very primitive. It would probably be a mistake to try to introduce democratic forms of government at least until far greater administrative efficiency has been obtained. The centres of population are so widely separated by intervening desert and jealousies between different States are such that there is little prospect of any tendency towards fusion of the different States except possibly in some cases among the very small States on the Trucial Coast. These territories have very little real con nexion with the rest of the Middle East or with the Arab world. Koweit is the most Arab, and even that is more concerned with trade with East Africa and India than the Middle East. On the whole no one seems much interested in the general questions of the Middle East and still less of the outside world. It is in general rather to our advantage that they should remain so. They are no doubt likely sooner or later, and in varying degrees, to suffer from the profound malaise which affects the rest of the Middle East, but the longer this can be put off the better. 4. All these sheikhdoms realise their potentially difficult position in relation to their much larger neighbours, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Persia, Pakistan, and, if only for this reason, value highly their special relations with His Majesty’s Government. Muscat is an independent State which has nevertheless particularly intimate relations with His Majesty’s Government who usually conduct its foreign relations at the Sultan's request. All the other sheikhdoms of the Persian Gulf have special treaty relations with His Majesty’s Government under which they are not allowed to conduct relations with foreign Powers except through His Majesty’s Government. They also have special obligations with regard to stopping^^j the slave trade. The extent to which Majesty’s Government’s influence ce^Jbe brought to bear on their internal a^airs varies considerably and will probably con tinue to do so. Our position in many parts of the area has declined of late largely owing to the lack of continuity due to the transfer of authority from the Government of India to the Commonwealth Relations Office and then to the Foreign Office and to post-war difficulties in providing personnel, accommodation and equipment for our representatives. This has already had unfortunate political repercussions and should be urgently remedied. 5. It is perhaps useful to state the raison d'etre of His Majesty’s Government’s present position in the Persian Gulf. We acquired this position with the usual mix ture of motives, partly strategical, partly commercial and partly humanitarian. The Persian Gulf is one of the main approaches to India : the coastal States are the trading centres for most of the interior of Eastern Arabia; and we wished to put down piracy, and, later, the slave trade. In spite of the changes which have taken place since we first established ourselves in the Gulf, our interests now are still in general very similar. Although we no longer govern India, our communications with it and with the Far £ast are still of the greatest pos sible importance. Airfields in the Arab sheikhdoms play an important part in the civil and military network of air routes. In addition to this the Gulf now has a strategic importance of its own due to the immense oil resources.. The denial of these resources to an enemy is recognised as one of our main strategic objectives. Apart from this, the present difficulties between the oil companies and the Persian and Iraq Governments emphasise how im portant it is in normal circumstances to have oil resources in territories over which we can exercise an important and direct influence. While we must be careful not to make discriminatory use of our political position to gain undue favour for British trade, it is clear that the immense growth of wealth in the Persian Gulf sheikhdoms is providing an important and growing market for British exports. On the humanitarian side our task as regards the slave trade is unfortunately by no means over and must indeed be tackled with re newed vigour. If we were to allow the3 Trucial Sheikhdoms to be absorbed into Saudi Arabia, which is now the chief market for slaves, the prospect of bringing these practices to an end would be indefi- 'Vjiitey deferred. To allow Bahrein to be %usorbed by Saudi Arabia or by Persia wcAi mean a disastrous decline in the administrative standards and in the happi ness of the people. If we tackle future problems in the smaller sheikhdoms and in Muscat with sufficient energy, we should be able to make the whole area a model of what the administration and social well being of middle eastern territory can be. 6. In general it is important that we should bear in mind that this is by no means an ordinary Foreign Office post and that our representatives on the Persian Gulf have a wide range of administrative, judicial and executive functions (e.g., they have criminal and civil jurisdiction over non-Arab foreigners who in Koweit alone number 7,000). In fact the Gulf posts are in a very small way at an intermediate stage between a normal diplomatic post and an administration such as that of the Sudan or the ex-Italian colonies. If our repre sentatives are to exercise these functions effectively, they must be able to give deci sions quickly, and we ought to allow them the greatest reasonable discretion. The inhabitants of this area are far more im pressed by the speed of decision and action than by its justice or accord with principle. That is to say, we must allow the Resident, and under him the Political Agents, to build themselves up a position of local authority and prestige in which they can influence events by their personality and their own decisions and not merely as cogs in a far away governmental machine which no Arab can understand. Koweit 7. Koweit is a small territory at the head of the Persian Gulf sandwiched between Iraq and Saudi Arabia. There is prac tically no water in the territory and no timber. Yet Koweit has for hundreds of years been the best boat-building centre of the Indian Ocean with a population of about 100,000, recently increased owing to oil development. Koweit merchants have traded for a very long time with India and East Africa. They have widespread financial ramifications. Koweit is an entrepot for smuggling of all kinds and particularly now for the smuggling of gold 130-1 into India. The new commercial activity due to the discovery of oil has not therefore produced quite so fundamental a trans formation as it is likely to do in some other areas. 8. The Koweit oil field is generally thought to contain the largest proved resources in the world. This is being ex ploited by the Koweit Oil Company, which is half American and half Anglo-Iranian. The estimated royalty receipts by Koweit are £1*5 million in 1948, £5-9 million in 1951 and £8-8 million in 1956. This does not include receipts from the Koweit half of the Koweit-Saudi neutral zone. 9. This fantastic new affluence has pro duced all the atmosphere of a boom town. Most of the money so far received is being used quite wisely in health, education, water and electricity supply and rebuilding of most of Koweit town. It has also stimu lated all existing business and there is probably hardly anyone among the 150,000 inhabitants of Koweit who has not benefited directly or indirectly. There is plenty to be done in Koweit with the royalties to be received for the next year or two, but after that it will become difficult to know what to do with the money. Moreover, the present use of it, though much wiser than might have been expected, is unco-ordin- ated. unplanned and probably wasteful. There is great need for outside advice. 10. Unfortunately, owing to past his torical events and to the wave of prosperit) on which the whole of Koweit is now riding, it has not been possible to secure the appointment of a British Adviser. We missed our chance of doing so in 1938 and 1939. At that time there was serious oppo sition against the sheikh (inspired partly by the German Legation at Bagdad). We still apparently believed that democratic forms were a panacea, and used our in fluence in favour of the creation of an elected council instead of using it in favour of better standards of administration and the appointment of British advisers. The result was naturally chaotic. As a result of further internal disturbances the council more or less disappeared and the functions of government were divided between the sheikh and a rival faction headed by one of his family. The latter gained control of the finances and apparently hold them still. When we have pressed the sheikh to appoint a British Adviser he has always replied that public opinion is not ready for it. He probably means that such an b 2appointment would actually amount to a breach of the modus vivendi reached with his opponents in 1939 and would therefore endanger the whole structure of the State. At the latest conversation with him on the subject he said that he would be ready to receive and consider advice from us on specific points given to the Political Agent and it seems for the time being we must make the best use we can of this channel, but in that case it is essential that there should be someone on the Political Resi dent’s staff capable of discovering what the financial situation is and of giving the right advice on technical, financial and com mercial matters. There is at present no such expert. 11. The other main trouble is that the Koweit Oil Company have been far too ready to fall in with all the sheikh’s de mands and requests to them provided that they were left more or less in peace. They are now beginning to get into trouble as a result of this appeasement policy and it is essential that they should adhere strictly to their political agreement with His Majesty’s Government under which they have to deal with the sheikh through the Political Agent on all non-routine matters. They must also be pressed to pay more attention to the training and education of local employees. 12. In Koweit as well as at Bahrein, there is practically no effective exchange control, and there are flourishing free currency markets of all kinds. Some con trol is supposed to be exercised through the Political Agent who has to issue certificates before foreign currency can be officially obtained through the bank, but in practice there are so many other sources that this hardly restricts the traffic in any way. This is yet another reason for having a financial-commercial expert on the Resi dent’s staff. Bahrein 13. Bahrein is in many ways a pleasant contrast to Koweit. Its climate is more humid but rather less severe. There is some natural fresh water with which palm groves and a certain amount of cultivation can be irrigated. Oil resources are con siderably smaller than at Koweit and have been developed for much longer. They produce a steady royalty income of under million a year. The administration is almost entirely in the hands of Mr. Bel- grave, the British Adviser to the sheikh, and there are several other British officials in the Bahrein Government. There is an excellent hospital with British senior staff. The educational system is not yet very extensive, but is being built up on what appear to be sound lines and has goodp prospects of expansion. There is a reas/fx- ably efficient police force. Very fuf^re- ports are available on the administration and finances. The financial administra tion has been criticised for being too con servative and not spending enough on development projects, but the total reserves are understood to be in the neighbourhood of £1 million, which does not seem alto gether excessive. A juster criticism is perhaps that, apart from a 5 per cent, import duty, there is no taxation of any kind so that the rich are not obliged to devote any of their wealth to improving the conditions of the poor. If there was larger revenue more could usefully be spent, e.g., on public health and on the search for and development of alternative sources of revenue. On the other hand no taxation is probably better than a flat in crease in indirect taxation which would operate to the disadvantage of the poorer classes. There is a certain amount of opposition to the regime among some of the younger men. This opposition is sometimes vocal but does not seem at present to present an imminent danger. 14. The Bahrein Petroleum Company is a wholly American company. It is regis tered in Canada because at the time when it obtained the concession we insisted that concessions should only go to British com panies. We were also able to insist that it should employ British personnel whenever possible with the result that there are now fai more British than American employees. The company extract limited quantities of oil in Bahrein. They may obtain some more from the surrounding sea-bed. Almost their chief activity is, however, the operation of a refinery which processes their own oil and large quantities of oil brought from Saudi Arabia by pipe-line. The refined products are sold mostly in the Middle East, India, the F&amp;r East and Australasia. The company started slowly in their welfare and educational work, but now seem to realise clearly the importance of training local employees up to as high levels as possible. 15. The main problems at Bahrein are to ensure that the administration keeps abreast of the development of social ideas and that the company are kept up to the mark as regards welfare and training, and130-1 b 3 to ensure that a competent British successor is available for Mr. Belgrave by the time that he has to retire. An incidental prob lem is to settle a very long-standing and ''S^ther petty quarrel between the Sheikh the neighbouring Sheikh of Qatar abc^f some ancestral rights of the Sheikhs of Bahrein in a small piece of the Qatar Desert. 16. There is, of course, in the back ground the possible difficulty of the Persian claim to Bahrein which we believe is quite unfounded and on which we are prepared in the last resort if necessary to go to the International Court. Qatar 17. This is the peninsula which stretches north from the Arabian mainland just to the east of Bahrein. It is quite a large area on the map, but is entirely composed of the bleakest and most inhospitable desert which can well be imagined. The local inhabitants are said to number not more than 20,000. Previous to the arrival of the oil company the only centres of population were two villages on the east coast, one of which, Doha, may be called the capital and has quite a good harbour for local boats. Prior to the discovery of oil it eked out a precarious existence by pearling and slaving. The oil concession is held by Petroleum Development, Qatar (Limited), a subsidiary of the Iraq Petroleum Com pany. They are busy constructing camps and oil terminals and will very shortly begin exporting oil. The estimated pro duction is 2 million tons in 1951 and 4 million tons in 1956 (the latter figure is 1 million tons more than the estimated pro duction of Egypt at the same time). Labour is being attracted from the various neighbouring territories and the popula tion will no doubt considerably increase. The sheikh is 84 and his son and heir is 60, and they will need considerable guidance in the many new problems with which they will be faced. Our first objective must be to have a British Political Officer estab lished in Qatar. There has not hitherto been such a post, Qatar being dealt with by the Political Agent at Bahrein. This is being negotiated with the sheikh at the present time. If the growth of wealth and population warrants it we shall, no doubt, wish also to have an adviser appointed in the sheikh’s administration. It would be useful to do this not only for the sake of Qatar itself, but as an example to the Tru- cial sheikhdoms, where development will come slightly later, but may follow the same pattern. 18. The frontier between Qatar and Saudi Arabia has been in dispute for a number of years and it is very largely due to alleged encroachment by the Arabian- American Company, who hold the Saudi Arabian concession, over this frontier, that we have become involved in general fron tier negotiations with Ibn Saud. It was over the Qatar frontier that the earlier negotiations before the war principally broke down. The Trucial Sheikhdoms 19. The coast east of Qatar as far as the point of land sticking up ifito the Strait of Hormuz and just round the corner of this point, is held by a series of small sheikh doms named Abu Dhabi, Dibai, Sharjah, Umm al Qaiwain, Ajman, Ras al Khaima and Kalba. These consist usually of a small settlement on the coast with an area inland of varying size owing rather problematical allegiance to the sheikh. Abu Dhabi is by far the largest territorially. Dibai is the only town of any size or importance (about 20,000 inhabitants with quite a sizeable market). Sharjah was formerly the most important and is the seat of the British Political Officer, though he is about to be moved to Dibai. Sharjah also has a large and potentially important aerodrome. All these sheikhs are in special treaty relations with His Majesty’s Government, by which the latter give them protection from each other and conduct their foreign relations in return for guarantees about stopping the slave trade and the exercise of jurisdiction over foreigners by His Majesty’s Govern ment. These sheikhdoms are all exceed ingly primitive. The ruling family of Abu Dhabi are respected by all those who have met them. The Sheikh of Dibai is in bad odour owing to some slavery cases, but his town is certainly the future centre of the whole coast. Sharjah is in decline. The others are even smaller and more barbarous. 20. The frontiers of Abu Dhabi with Saudi Arabia have never been settled and are also very much in dispute. The others probably have no common frontier with Saudi Arabia, but the frontiers between the sheikhdoms are also in most cases quite uncertain. We have just begun to delimit them. There are a few settlements in oases in the interior. 21. The concessions for the whole coast are held by subsidiaries of the Iraq Petro leum Company. There is good prospect ofoil about on the frontier between Abu Dhabi and Dibai. Work will begin on this fairly soon. 22. The chief problem in the Trucial Coast at present is undoubtedly the renewed prevalence of slave raiding and the slave trade. The Saudi Arabians have become so enriched with oil royalties that they can afford to pay hitherto unheard-of prices for male and female slaves. Conditions in the interior of the Trucial Coast and of Muscat are on the other hand so miserable that there is a natural tendency for the more powerful inhabitants to kidnap others and sell them to Saudi Arabia and even in some cases for people to sell themselves as slaves so as to be sure of having enough to eat. A large part of the trade is centred at Buraimi where Abu Dhabi and Muscat territory meet. Much of it probably passes through Dibai, very likely with the connivance and possibly par ticipation of the sheikh. The slaves are taken thence overland or by sea to Qatar and thence into Saudi Arabia. It is abso lutely essential that we should put down this traffic as quickly as possible. Our moral right to be in the Gulf depends largely on our suppression of the slave trade and its continuance will bring us into disrepute locally and throughout the world. Unfortunately, the methods which were used in the past, namely, the searching of local craft by His Majesty’s ships, blockade and, in the last resort, naval bombardment, are no longer applicable in these days when the local craft have diesel engines and when opinion in the outside world would be horri fied at a bombardment. The only solution seems to be to establish a small local force under British command in the Trucial Coast. (Separate recommendations are being made on this subject.) 23. The other political problem which immediately springs to the mind of the visitor to the Trucial Coast is whether it would not be possible and desirable for these very small sheikhdoms to be amalgamated or federated in some way,so that there could be more efficient administration and a fair distribution of revenue from oil instead of the present situation in which two of the sheikhdoms will get quite considerable revenues and the rest nothing. It may be useful to bear this in mind as an ultimate objective but the difficulties of implement ing it are so immense that we probably have neither the time nor the resources to devote much effort to the task at present. The sheikhs are mostly on bad terms with each other and their territories are separated by large tracts of uninhabited desert. The communications along the coast are ex tremely poor and unreliable. Moreover,^, Arab ideas of charity, though remarkai^/ well-developed in some ways, certainl^w not extend to sharing oil royalties between one State which happens to have oil and another which does not. It must be ques tionable how far the smaller sheikhdoms would benefit from being forcibly jincor- porated in the richer ones, which is the only way in which the idea might have some chance of being applied in practice. The most likely development is that when oil begins to be worked in Abu Dhabi and Dibai and in the neighbouring sea-bed areas, all or almost all the inhabitants of the other sheikhdoms will move there in search of employment. This may leave the smaller sheikhdoms almost empty, or, alternatively, homes may be kept going there with money remitted by oil company employees. Muscat 24. The coast-line of Muscat extends roughly from Ras Masandam round the south-east corner of Arabia to the borders of the Hadhramaut between Qishn and Salala on the south coast. It also extends theoretically inland for an indefinite dis tance up to its frontier with Saudi Arabia which has never been even remotely deter mined. The territory consists of a long strip of inhabited coastal plain between Kalba and Muscat known as the Batinah coast, a rocky but inhabited and fairly settled coastal belt between Muscat and Ras el Hadd (the south-east point of Arabia), a desolate and mainly uninhabited coast line from there westwards to Dhofar, a surprisingly fertile area at Dhofar watered by the monsoon, and a hinterland composed partly of desert and partly, behind the Batinah coast, of quite high mountains, and all sparsely inhabited by nomad Bedouins. The Sultan controls effectively only the Batinah coast, the coastal strip from Muscat to Ras el Hadd, and Dhofar. In the interior south-west of the Batinah coast, there is an area controlled quite effectively by an Imam, who is nominally a spiritual ruler, but in fact exercises con siderable temporal authority and owes no real allegiance to the Sultan. Apart from this the tribes in the interior and between Dhofar and Ras el Hadd are almost entirely out of control and owe allegiance only to their own sheikhs.25. The above description of the terri tory indicates clearly the chief problems and difficulties with which it is faced. It has been suggested that we are largely ^sponsible for the state of anarchy in the nS^ior of Muscat because when we stopped thewade in arms and slaves on which Mus cat used to flourish, we impoverished the sultans to such an extent that it was no longer possible for them to pay the sub sidies to the tribes on which their influence had previously depended. One has only to consider what Ibn Saud’s position would be without the pilgrimage and oil revenues. It is certainly true that Muscat has come down in the world since the days when it was the major power in Arabia. The ques tion now is whether the Sultan can re establish his authority in the interior vis- a-vis both the Imam and the independent tribes. This problem has been brought to a head by Ibn Saud’s territorial claims, with which we have now to deal, and by the probable existence of oil in the interior. Petroleum Concessions, Limited, have hitherto been prevented from even explor ing the territory which they think the most interesting because of insecure conditions and the disobedience of the tribes to the Sultan’s orders. The Sultan is anxious to extend his authority, but he is incapable with his own resources of doing so. He asked us in the past if we would give him the support of the R.A.F. in bringing the interior into subjection, but this had to be refused. We are now urgently considering in conjunction with I.P.C. whether by an extra subsidy from the company, or in any other way, he can be put in a position in which he can re-establish security in the interior so that the oil company can con tinue their work. The possibility of find ing oil in large quantities in an area in which it could be brought to the sea east or south of the narrows at the Straits of Hormuz has a strategic interest which is immediately obvious. It is therefore greatly in the interests of His Majesty s Government that the oil company’s opera tions should be facilitated. Moreover, if the Sultan does not extend his authority in the interior, some of the tribes will probably tend to give their allegiance to Ibn Saud. If his claims to the territory were established this would mean that the oil resources would automatically pass to the Arabian-American Company. 26. Apart from these very serious diffi culties, Muscat has more interesting possibilities of general development than the other Persian Gulf States. The fisheries already play an important part in the economy of the country, and are capable of considerable development and moderni sation. There is considerable scope for agricultural improvement in the Dhofar territory, and there is probably also scope for improving the standards of date cul tivation on the Batinah coast. There is a deposit of coal near Sur which it was found unprofitable to work some years ago, but which may be worth investigating again in the light of present prices. A piped water supply is being laid on for the towns of Muscat and Sur. Public health measures in Muscat town are still in an embryonic stage, but are very much required. 27. Muscat has by far the largest popula tion of the Persian Gulf States. The inhabitants of the Batinah coast alone have been estimated at a quarter of a million. The formal status of Muscat is different to that of the other territories since it is a wholly independent State and we are not responsible for its foreign relations. We have, however, jurisdiction over British subjects and, in practice, the Sultan usually asks us to conduct his foreign relations for him. The Sultan is better educated than the other Persian Gulf rulers, having been at the Princes’ College in India. He speaks English well. This education has its dis advantages since he is said to behave too much like an Indian ruler, preferring to stay in the background rather than to show himself to his people and be open to access from everybody as is the practice of Arab rulers. His temperament and upbringing may be yet another obstacle to the extension of his authority in the interior. The inhabitants of Muscat town are almost entirely non-Arab (largely Indian and Persian). The Sultan has recently appointed an Englishman, formerly in the Indian Political Service, as his Ministei for Foreign Affairs. 28. Muscat owns a small piece of terri tory on the Pakistan coast, named Gwadur. Pakistan is trying to buy this territory from the Sultan. 29. The summer climate is one of the most severe in the world. B. A. B. BURROWS. %th June, 1949. 7Enclosure 2 Education in the Persian Gulf Koweit There has been a rapid growth of primary education in the last year or two. This now covers some 2,000 boys and 1,000 girls. The teachers are largely Egyptian and Palestine Arab. There are also some local teachers. There are only sixty children receiving secondary education. Great difficulty is found in obtaining candidates for secondary education because comparatively lucrative jobs in the oil company and in business are available to those with even the rudiments of education which they can obtain at the primary schools. Moreover, girls seldom continue their education beyond the age of about 12 because they normally get engaged or married at that age. There are some ninety students from Koweit in a hostel at Cairo. The arrange ment was originally made by Mr. High- wood of the British Council. The Koweit authorities are satisfied with this arrange ment and the Political Resident was favourably impressed with the hostel when he recently visited Cairo. The Egyptian Director of Education told Mr. Keight while I was in Koweit that it was his ambition to make Koweit a centre of religious education in the Middle East. I mentioned to the Minister of Educa tion, who is a member of the Sheikh’s family, the possibility of appointing an English teacher to teach in the secondary school. He first replied that the Egyptians and Palestinian Arabs who taught there spoke English so perfectly that this was unnecessary, but he later said he would consider the possibility particularly with a view to preparing Koweit students for higher education in England or America. The Koweit Oil Company have started to give extremely elementary teaching to a few of their local workers. I do not think there is any prospect of getting a British expert employed by the Koweit Government at any high level in their educational organisation, but if the British Council agree that it is desirable I think it might be worth while to press for the appointment of a British teacher. It would in any case be most desirable for the greatest possible measure of contact to be maintained between the British Council representative at Basra and the Director of Education in Koweit in the hope of our being able to guide the latter towards relatively efficient educational methods and particularly away from his idea of conceiv trating on religious education. In view of the political dangers to -wpich' students in Cairo are exposed it is clearly for consideration whether we should attempt to persuade the Koweit authorities to send their advanced students to the American University at Beirut (A.U.B.) rather than to Cairo. We should find it extremely difficult to do this and I am not at all sure that the attempt would be worth while. The main requirement at Koweit seems to be that the Koweit Oil Company should rapidly increase its interest in local educa tion. The best method seems to be that the Company should concentrate on technical training and specialised educa tion. They should begin with an appren tice scheme by which they would engage boys as young as possible and pay them as ordinary employees but in fact arrange for them to spend half their time receiving intensive training in work which they could subsequently do for the company, thus replacing Indians and eventually Europeans. The most promising appren tices could be sent to engineering and other establishments in the United Kingdom and America to complete their training. Others might be sent to the American University at Beirut if there were suitable courses there for them. I spoke on these lines to the local manager of the K.O.C., who recognised that something on these lines should be done as soon as possible and said that the company had only been prevented from doing so already by their rapid construction programme, which had taken up all their energies. We should press the London management of the com pany to go ahead with plans on the above lines as quickly as possible. It is for consideration whether the K.O.C. should contribute to general educa tion in Koweit. There would be advantage from the point of view of their general relations with Koweit if they offered a few scholarships at the American University at Beirut or in the United Kingdom and America for general purposes not con nected with the company’s work, but on the whole general education should be the function of the State, which is or will be receiving ample revenue from oil for the purpose.&amp; 9 Bahrein Educational facilities have been pro gressively increased and the programme future developments seems relatively sat^tfactory in relation to the size and nee'ES of the population. There are about the same number of children in primary schools as at Koweit. The secondary school has about 100 students, some of whom are receiving special teacher’s training. The Director of Education is a Bahreini with some Egyptian and some Palestinian Arab teachers under him. Mr. Belgrave, the British Adviser to the Sheikh of Bahrein, takes a very keen personal interest in all educational matters. The secondary school is combined with a hostel in which boys from outlying villages, and in some cases from other parts of the Persian Gulf, live in some what the same conditions as in a boarding school in this country. There used to be a British Director of Education but when the post last became vacant we were unable to supply a new candidate and after some delay the present Director was appointed. There seems no chance of changing this arrangement. There is, however, quite a possibility of the appointment of a British teacher of English for the secondary school and Mr. Belgrave is in touch with an English teacher in Egypt. An attempt was made to send students for higher education to Cairo in the same way as is done from Koweit, but after a very short experience of this arrangement it was found that the Bahreini students were imbibing undesirable political ideas and they were recalled. A number of Bahreinis are now at the American Uni versity at Beirut, where some of them- receive teachers’ training. The Bahrein Petroleum Company has just obtained ap proval from its head office to offer a number of scholarships to the American University at Beirut. It is also intended to send four Bahreini students to Nottingham Univer sity this year for a teachers’ training course. If this experiment is successful further students will be sent in future. In Bahrein, as in Koweit. one of the greatest difficulties is to persuade both boys and girls to continue their education long enough. Moreover, the teaching profes sion is not popular as compared with work in the oil company and other kinds of business. The Bahrein Petroleum Company appear to have shown rather little interest in the education of local employees until quite recently. Now, however, the local manager gives the impression of being fully con vinced of the great importance of training Bahreinis to fit them for higher grades of work in the company. The company have organised general classes for some of their employees and have some rather haphazard arrangements for training apprentices. My impression is that they could well intensify this work and start at an earlier age. The grant of scholarships for the A.U.B. is satisfactory. More could be done in the direction of advanced appren tice or training courses in the United Kingdom and United States. Qatar and the Trucial Coast Owing to the complete absence of educa tion in Qatar and on the Trucial Coast serious consideration should be given to the possibility of progressively using Bahrein as the educational centre for these areas until they are able to set up educational facilities of their own. There would be some political difficulty in the case of Qatar owing to the feud between the two rulers. If this difficulty makes it impossible for Qatar education to be focused on Bahrein, urgent consideration will have to be given to the needs of Qatar for education since there is already a large influx of workers there and this will rapidly increase over the next few years. The same will take place at a somewhat later stage in some parts of the Trucial Coast, notably Abu Dhabi and Dubai, where oil is almost certain to be worked fairly soon. We must try to make sure that these places go the way of Bah rein rather than the way of Koweit. Muscat There is one Arab primary school, the teachers including Palestinian Arab. There are other schools for some of the Indian and Persian inhabitants who form the great majority of the population of the town of Muscat. Higher education is only obtainable in individual cases. The Sultan has asked for the services of some more Palestinian Arab teachers, particularly for Dhofar. There seems to be practically no provision for the education of the very numerous inhabitants of the Batinah Coast (said on some estimates to amount to a quarter of a million) or for the large Be douin population of the interior. The State has no money with which to provide any large extension of education.It is open to question whether Muscat should look for its higher education in the direction of Karachi, Bahrein or Aden (or possibly even Khartum). Karachi should probably be avoided. The ruling family of Muscat are already far too much out of touch with the Arab inhabitants and this is largely attributed to their Indian educa tion. A similar Indian flavour in the edu cation of a future “ intellectual ” class would add to the danger of splitting the country in two. On the whole the most useful channel would seem to be towards Bahrein and the American University at Beirut. General One of the most urgent requirements seems to be that the younger members of ruling families throughout the Gulf should obtain satisfactory education. At present one member of the Bahrein ruling family is at a university in America, having failed to obtain admittance to universities in the United Kingdom. The son of the Sultan of Muscat will probably go shortly to the American College at Damascus. Other wise nothing in this direction is being done. A serious effort should be made to have one or more members of each ruling family, including as many as possible of the Trucial Coast sheikhs, sent to receive a good Ar&amp;bjp and, if possible, later, English educai jh outside the Persian Gulf. If the Amer an College at Damascus is a really satisfactory institution for this purpose this might be best as a first stage until any of them are proficient enough at English to go to Vic toria College at Alexandria or Cairo. While the present demand for all kinds of labour by the oil companies continues, there is unlikely to be much danger of the creation by unsuitable methods of education of a class of unemployed effendis, such as has poisoned the political and educational atmosphere in Egypt and Iraq. But this is a danger which must always be borne very clearly in mind. It is most likely to arise in Koweit. A progressive increase in opportunities for technical education in the oil companies will do something to minimise the danger. B. A. B.
