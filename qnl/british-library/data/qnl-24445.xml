Dear 3ir, IL ^ umm-al-q,uwain concession negotiations 1. /we acknowledge herewith receipt of Mr. Skliros’s telegram No.4 dated the 7th of January forwarded to us under your c/210 dated the 10th of February. 2. You will have noted that the abovementioned tele gram contains instructions for Mr. Lermitte to proceed to Umm-al-Quwain to negotiate an oil agreement with the Ruler, preferably in the form of a Concession with terms in general similar to those of Sharjah out excluding drilling obligations. 3. It is assumed that the Hon’ble the Political Resident or you have informed or will inform the Ruler of the Company's intention to open negotiations for a Concession and it will be in order for Mr. Lermitte to proceed to Umm-al-Quwain when this has been done. Mr. Lermitte proposes to use our M.L. ,T Ghazal ,f as his headquarters and to lie off Umm-al-^uwain. 4. It is presumed that there are no land ownership disputes at present affecting Umm-al-Quwain territory or its border areas sufficiently serious to induce the Ruler to postpone Concession negotiations as occurred in 1939 when Moh'd bin Ali of the Bani Chitab repudiated Sharjah's claims to Jabal 3aiyah. In this connection, it would be useful for the Company to know the position regarding Jabal Faiyah, and if Sharjah has been warned by Political authorities that his claims to Jabal Faiyah are not regarded as substantiated. • • •2 T/SA.20/39 04 5. It will be necessary for us to keep our Managing Director, London, and the Hon’ble the Political Resident and yourself in touch with the progress of the negotiations, and we suggest that the channels should be on the lines of the Ajinan negotiations, which were approved by you vide your C/973 dated the 24th of June 1944. A note on the suggested procedure is attached. L-fo/a-/ 2 , _ ... 6. V/e should like an opportunity to discuss this letter and any other arrangements which may arise in connection with the opening of the negotiations with you before Mr. Lermitte leaves. Yours faithfully, For &amp; on behalf of PETROLEUM DEVELOPMENT (TRUCIAL COAST) LTD. Enel.METHOD FOR CONDUCTING CORRESPONDENCE AND TELEGRAMS BETWEEN MR. LERMITTE, UMM AL ^ir.,A.IN; IvIANAGER, P.C.L. , BAHRAIN, AND MANAGING DIRECTOR, P.C.L., LONDON, (BASED ON PROCEDURE APPROVED BY THE POLITICAL AGENT). 1• GENERAL The procedure is designed to give maximum secrecy locally while keeping the Political Agent (and through him the Political Resident) fully informed. Communications between Mr. Lermitte, Umm al Quwain, and P.C.L., Bahrain, will be by letters sent through the bag of the Residency Agent, Sharjah, to the Political Agent, Bahrain. These letters will be addressed to the Manager, P.C.L., Bahrain, and sealed down. If such letters entail reference to the Managing Director, London, telegrams will be drafted by Manager, P.C.L., Bahrain, and sent through Agency channels. When necessary or desirable, the Political Agent proposes to send the contents of such telegrams to the Political Resident who will then be in a position to send his views to the India Office. (Telegrams will not normally be used between Umm al ^uwain (Sharjah) and Bahrain and vice versa). 2. MR. LSRKITTE’S REPORT Unless the Ruler accepts the terms laid down by Mr. skliros, Mr. Lermitte will report the situation by letter to Bahrain, and this will in all probability entail reference by telegram to London. Mr. permitte’s reports should include the Shaikh’s attitude and demands and his own views and recommendations in all cases. Bahrain, IBth February, 1945.i Political Agency, Bahrain, 18th February 1945. Major X. Hickinbotham, polioical 'Agent, Bahrain. The Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Camp Bahrain. lo I have the honour to enclose a copy of a letter No.TA/SA.20/3904 dated February the 12th from the Manager of Messrs. Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Limited on the subject of their forthcoming negotiations with the Shaikh of Utam-al-Qawain for an oil concession. if 2. In 1937 the Shaikh of U:im-ii.-Qa\min was informed of Messrs. Petroleum Concessions Limited’s position vis-a-vis /c ' His Majesty’s Goveirnment in Residency Agent’s letter No.C/689 dated 19th July (copy enclosed). I see no need for any further communication to be made and suggest that I should so inform the Manager of Messrs, petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Limited at the same time stating that there is no objection to Mr. Lermitte proceeding tc {Jtom-al-Qav’ain as soon as he may consider convenient. 3. I am not aware of any territorial disagreements between T Jmm-al-Qawain and the Beni Qitab tribe nor was I aware that the shaikh of Sharjahtetlaims to the Jebel Faiyuh area had not been substantiated. I suggest that Mr. Packer should be informed that negotiations are now in progress with a view to persuading the shaikh of Sharjah to come to a financial arrangement with the Beni Qitab for the purpose of ensuring the entry of his Company’s exploration parties into the Jebel Falyah area and of obviating the necessity for any separate agreement being negotiated v/ith th- Beni Qitab, a tribe v/hose territorial limits will be particularly difficult to define.Should these negotiations fail, which is not improbable, there would at present appear to be lietie difficulty in arranging for a representative of the Company to meet Shaikh Mohamed bin Ali bin Huwaidin the paramount shaikh of the tribe with a view to enlisting his cooperation and help for,possibly, a financial consideration. 4 # j see no objection to the method of communication which Mr. packer has outlined in the enclosure to his letter under reference and, with your approval, so propose to inform him I have the honour to be, Sir, your most obedient servant political Agent, Bahrain.

The limitation imposed in my telegram of February 8th was intended to cover confidential annual payment of Rs.10,000 but I would prefer that such form of payment should be avoided if possible and all personal payments be unrecorded. 2. I appreciate that presents to relatives et cetera are customary and probably unavoidable and Lermitte may go up to Sharjah figure but should not offer cars or lorries are unobtain able at present. - RLTAXANDUM - R.M.

On reconsideration, if this is likely to cause difficulty I see no objection to Abu Dhabi and Kalba procedure being followed in the case of Umm al Quwain except as regards undertaking*from Shaikh relating to opening of bank. 3 # . An attempt is now being made to open a bank on Arab Coast (with a branch on Trucial Coast) registered in India but with ^raqi capital and direction., I think it desirable therefore that we should try to secure if possible undertaking from the Shaikh of Umm al Quwain, similar to that obtained from Shaikhs of Sharjah and Deoai, before conveying approval of concession. 4.

As you will be aware, it is necessary for His Majesty* s Government’s formal^approval of the Concession Agreement to~be conveyed to the Sheikh. This it is now proposed to do. the Sheikh being required at the same time to give an undertaking, by means of an exchange of letters, that he will obtain Kis ‘ Majesty’s Government’s approval before granting permission for any bank to open a branch in his territory. 3 3. _ It will now be desirable* as in the'case of the other Trucial Coast Oil Concessions, for a Political Agreement to be concluded between your Company and His Majesty's Government, though the ohcikh will not in this case be required to take cognizance oi the Political Agreement before receiving His Lajest, 's Government's approval of the Concession Agreement. I am authorised to enclose the draft of such a Political Agreement for your Company’s consideration. This follows the lines generally of the Abu Phabi and Kalb a Political Agreements, though we have substituted 'the Concession from the Sheikh' for 'the Agreement between the Company and the Sheikh' in Clauses 2, 3 , 5 6 and 7. He also propose to insert at the end of Section (1) ,* of* the Pre-emption Clause the words 'The. Company if required shall 30 consult with His Majesty’s Government regarding the production oj. other oils.'' Tne reason for doing this is that, while in modern warfare the importance of Admiralty fuel is as Brigadier S.H. Longrigg, . /great Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Limited, Ling House, Dominion Street E.C.2.$ /tt\ 4-' groat as ever, this product has been joined by a number of other military oil fuels which have to comply with stringent specifications. His Majesty's Government feel that these fuels also should be covered in any new Political .agreement. 4. If the terms of the draft Agreement are acceptable to i^our Company, we will, on hearing from you further, take the necessary steps to have the Agreement prepared lor signature. If, however, there are any points on which you would like to exchange views, we shall of course be glad to do so. . tours sincerol^ 'A P 4India Office, Whitehall, S.W. 1. Ext.6085/45 . December, 1945. Thank you for your letter No.P. C. 34 A of 19th November regarding the draft Umm-al-Qawain Political Agreement, 2. We see no objection to the addition of the words 'or elsewhere in South Eastern Arabia', as you suggest, in Article 4* 3. As regards the insertion which you suggest in Article 10 and the reproduction of Article 11 of the Dibai and Sharjah Political AgreementSyj these p(pint's..-w^fe considered in connection with the Abii Dhabi and Kalba Political Agreements. In his letter to you No.P. Z. 81/40 of 5th February, 1940, Gibson commented in this ^ connection 'Apart from objections on the grounds of the difficulties to which the interpretation of the word 'unreasonably' may give rise, the inclusion in Article 10 of the phrase 'the Sheikh shall not unreasonably withhold such pemission' is not considered appropriate because, as you are aware, it is not proposed in the case of Abu Dhabi and Kalba to require the Ruler to take cognisance of the Political Agreement which therefore cannot impose obligations on him. 4. Similarly the provisions found in Article 11 of the Dibai and Sharjah Agreements are not relevant here since the Rulers are not to be asked to agree to apply sanctions in the event (which we hope will not occur!) of a breach of the Political Agreement by the Company'. Your Company accepted this view. 5* The Ruler of Umm-al-Qawain is not to be asked to take cognisance of the Political Agreement and therefore the case of v Umm-al-Qawain is strictly parallel with that of Abu Dhabi and Kalba and not with that of Dibai and Sharjah. 6 6 . I hope that the above explanation will satisfy you that the /words Brigadier S.H.Longrigg, Petroleum Concessions Limited, Ling House, Dominions Street, E. C. 2.2 . words in question in Article 10 and the whole of Article 11 of the Dibai and Sharjah Agreement need not be reproduced in the Umm-al-Qawain /agreement. 7 * I enclose herewith a revised fair copy of the draft embodying the other amendments to which we have agreed. -•Vx,COPY - EXT, 6085/45 PETR0LEUL1 CONCESSIONS LIMITED Ling House, Dominion Street, L?.v, 34A- London, E.C.2. * 19th November, 194-5. Dear Donaldson, I refer to your D.O. letter dated 30th October regarding the Political Agreement between and Petroleum Concessions Lta., arising out of our Umm al Qawain Concession, and the draft Agreement which accompanied your letter. Certain possible, though minor - and, I think, desirable - amendments or additions occur to me, and I should be grateful if these could be incorporated in the final draft which you will be able, I hope, to send to us for submission to the Board; it is of course, only after Board agreement to the final draft that papers can be put before them to receive the Company's seal. In Article 4 . where it is stated that the Company's chief local representative 'will be ordinarily resident in Umm al Qawain or Bahrain ,^it seems desirable to add: 'or elsewhere in South Eastern Arabia', since our local headquarters might easily turn out to be at Sharjah, Muscat or elsewhere, according to the location of the oilfields discovered. In Article 10, the previous Political Agreements provide that 'the Shaikh shall not unreasonably withhold such permission.' I su SS es t that this might be inserted. I note that Article 11 of the Dibai and the Sharjah Political Agreements has been omitted. It is to the effect that the Shaikh cannot terminate the Agreement (on the ground that the Company has failed to observe its terms) except after arbitration proceedings and after the Company has failed to comply with the award of the arbitrators. There seems no special reason why this safeguard in our favour should be omitted? Somewhat more importance attaches to the suggested addition to Clause 1 in the Schedule, to the effect that 'the Company if required, shall also consult with H.M.G. regarding the production 01 other oils'. The Company will not oppose the insertion of this new sentence, since the obligation which it thus assumes is one only cf consultation': it is, of course, to be understood that the production of, for instance, a high octane aviation spirit might be a very serious undertaking and one for which provision would need to be agreed between H.M.G. and the Company at the time If you feel able to send us a revised text cf the Political Agreement incorporating the suggestions made above, I shall hope to convey to you the Company's final agreement and its willingness to Yours sincerely, « v ( Sgd.)
