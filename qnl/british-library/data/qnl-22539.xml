P,T,0. \Copy of express letter Wo. F-61-14/47 dated, Nevv Delhi the 7tii July, 1948, from the Deputy Director General, Posts and telegraphs. New Delhi, to all Postmasters- General, Aauitional Postmasters-General, Puri and Delhi. Director of Posts and Telegraphs, Shillong, received under Foreign, New Delhi endorsement No. D.oS19-A/48 dated the A 27tli July. 1948. A question arose as to how the premia on postal insurance policies of persons who proceed out of Imia are to be realised and accounted for. Under note 3 below rule 28 of the O.I.F rules, when an insured person proceeds on leave out of Inuia, he should arrange with the Deputy Accountant General, Posts and Telegraphs, Calcutta for the payment of the premia at an Indian Post Office monthly or for the whole period of his absence in advance. Similarly, when a insured person quit India, he should arrange for the payment of the premia in an Inaian Post Office, vide Rule 38 ibid. Rule 38 applies to all cases where insurants leave India, e .g., for employment with Embassy etc, and is not confirmed to cases of retirement or resignation of their posts. 2. ^ Lately, hov/ever, it is 'noticed that credits for premia of insurants who have joined Embassies are being received throught the Accountant General, Central Revenues. This procedure involves consiaerable delay and complications in accounting. It has, therefore, been decided that insurants going out of India should make arrangements with the Deputy Accountant General, Posts and Telegraphs, Calcutta for the payment of the premia monthly or for any period in advance at a post office in India selected by them. To avoid hardship, hov/ever, it has also been decided that such insurants may be allowed either (1) to ask their Bankers in India to pay cash into a post office or (2) to send bank drafts or cheques drawn on local banks in India to the General Post Office in India who will realise them and afford credit to the Deputy Accountant General, Posts and Telegraphs, Calcutta, in the usual way. In all these cases receipts for premia in form A.C.G 67 should be issued to the insurants or to the Bankers if premia is paid by the iatter. The number of the cheque or draft should be noted in the receipt. 3. Necessary instructions may kindly be issued to all General Post Offices under your control immediately.
