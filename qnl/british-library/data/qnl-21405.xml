When an official, to whom secret documents have been issued, vacates his appointnuat, or is transferrji, or is re lieved of his duties for any period,.the documents in his posses sion must be personally made over to his successor. 3. An officer to whom secret documents are issued will keep a list of such documents in his charge, which list will be compared when taking over the documents with the receipt form then signed. Any deficiency noticed then, as at any other time, should at once be reported, through the usual channel, to the issuing authority, and immediate steps be taken to trace the missing document and fix the responsibility for its loss. 4. All officers who receive secret documents will furnish to the issuing authority a certificate on A. F. A-24 on the Ist December, for such documents. 5k Attention i3 directed to the letter reproduced opposite. It has coma to the notice of the Commander-in-Chief that notwithstanding tho very clear and precise orders which have from time to time baen issued to ensure the secrecy of documents, there have been instances recently where tho mosD reprehensible laxity has been shown in the observ ance of those orders. 2. This laxity can obviously only have arisen from a want of adequate appreciation of the responsibility resting upon those to whose care these important secret documents have been entrusted, and in order that there may be nofe misunderstanding in the future as to the serious nature of these responsibilities, the Commaiider-in-Chief wishes all concerned to be informed that he intends to take the severest notice of any future neglect of the orders. 3. Under His Excellency's directions a copy of this lettef will be attached to all documents, the secret nature of which may necessitate their being issued for the personal information of those concerned.SECRET.

This study has been undertaken with a view to foreseeing the probable developments of military and commercial activity in Persia and the neighbourhood of the Persian Gulf; determining the probable objects and ambitions of the various Powers interested m these developments and of estimating the means they have at their disposal for carrying their intentions into effect; so that a reasoned opinion may be formed as to the military measures rendered advisable by any circumstances likely to arise in this part of the world in the near future. 2. The area considered embraces Persia and the countries bordering on the Persian Gulf, and for convenience of descrip tion and reference is divided up as follows :— (a) Northern zone. —Consisting of Northern Persia extending as far south as the line Khaniqin, Khurramabad, Is fahan, Yazd, Birjand in which Eussian interests are largely predominant. {h) Southern zone. —Consisting of the remainder of Persia where British and Indian interests are preponderate. (c) Mesopotamia. —From Baghdad southwards where Brit ish and incipient German interests are combined with those of Turkey. (d) Arabian Littoral. —Consisting of the remaining countries bordering on the west of the Persian Gulf in which British interests are at present most largely represented, though Turkey lays claim to dominion in parts of it. The Northern Zone. 3. This zone is formed by a large portion of the vast Iranian / ^ -i t „ a plateau, which rises on the north from (a) Physical features as f ' . affecting military operations, the Caspian Sea and the plains of Tur- mountains, rivers, forests, kistan, on the east and west from the deserts, etc. valleys of the Indus and Tigris respec tively, on the south from the Persian Gulf and the Arabian Sea; on the north and west it is bounded by mountain ranges which extend from the neighbourhood of lake Urumieh, 4,200' S248GSBabove soa-levol, to the Caspian and thence along its southern shores to the frontiers of Afghanistan. The mean altitude of this tableland is from 3,000 to 5,000 feet, while some of the ranges run for over a hundred miles at mean altitudes of 8,000 to 10,000 feet, rising in places to much greater heights. The zone then in its west and northern portions is very mountainous while the remainder is a flat plateau in the centre of which is the desert called Dasht-i-Kavir. In it aro included the provinces of Azarbaijan, Gilan, Ardalan, Kirma-shah, Mazandaran, Isfahan and Khorasan. 4. West of Lake Urumioh the crests of the mountains form a natural boundary between Turkey and Azarba'j' n and further south, certain ranges, called generally the Zagros, do the same be tween Turkey and Kurdist'm. The Elburz range connects the mountains of Azarbaij ln with those of Meshed running eastwards to the Pamirs. Azarbiijan is a mass of mountains; the highest peak is Savalan (15,792) west of Ardab l. These mountains are celebrated for their coal deposits. In the Elburz mountains the northern slopes are clothed with dense forests while the southern slopes are precipitous and bare. The highest peak is Damavand (18,600) north-east of Tehran. East of Kuh-i-Zirkahi the range loses its covering of forest and becomes bare and rugged, though at intervals fertile plateaus are found within it. These features be come emphasized as the mountains reach Afghanistan. 5. The principal rivers in the zone flow either into Lake Uramieh in Azarbaijan or into the deserts of Turkisfon and the Caspian. Commencing on the west these are :— ■ The Jaghatu falling into Lake Urumich on the south from Kurdistan, easily fordable in summer but difficult in winter. The Ajichai enters Lake Urumieh from the east rising near Ardabil. In spring it is large and rapid owing to melting snows, in summer nearly dry, in winter s metimes frozen over and covered with snow. The Kizil Uzun is a large river df tortuous course rising in Arda lan and flowing into the Caspian near Rasht. The water is lowest in November when it is fordable. The Gurgan river rising on the plateau of Armutll flows west into the Caspian north of Astarabad bay, it is very swollen after melting of snow and in summer rains and is rarely fordable at any time. Its banks are high and steep. The Atrak flows west into the Caspian and forms the boundary of Persia for a part of its course. Fordable points are at long intervals.The Kashaf rises near Meshed and flows into the Hari Rud near Pul-i-Khatun. In summer the water is low owing to irrigation and it can be forded, but in winter it is impassable. The Hari Rfid and Tejen forms part of the boundary between Persia and Afghanistan ; owing to evaporation the water in its lower readies is less than in the upper ones. Except when swol len by melting snow it is not a formidable obstacle. The rivers entering the central deserts are unimportant. 6. In Khorasan the soil is very varied ; the north-west, north and north : east. portions are rich, well irrigated and most productive and among the. mountains the valleys are very fertile; but in the desert countries to the south the reverse is the case. In Azarbaijan, Kurdistan, Mazandaran and the provinces sometimes known as Iraq-i-Ajam the soil is often very fertile but owing to paucity of either water or inhabitants cultivation is less gcn&lt; ral and grazing more extensive, 7. Forests are not prevalent in the mountains of Azarbaijan but they are extensive and dense on the northern slopes of the Elburz mountains and some exist in Kurdistan. The mountains in Iraq-i-Ajam are barren and devoid of timber and the same remark applies generally to the mountains of Khorasan. 8. The only lake of any size in this zone is Lake Urfimieh in Azarbaijan. It is salt and shallow and the bed is a series of terraces bo that each change of depth takes place abruptlv. No fish can live in its waters and its banks are covered with a thick treacherous Blime emitting a horrible effluviam. Deserts are however extensive, especially the Dasht-i-Kavir which occupies the centre of Khorasan. This is composed of dark soil but is absolutely destitute of all animal life or sign of vegetation. It cannot be crossed in summer on account of the heat and in winter after rain the whole becomes a quagmire into which men and animals sink and cannot move. This desert forms an insurmountable obstacle for the movement of an army across it. 9. The climate is very varied but may be generally described (b) Climaie. fr' 01 ^ 1 extreme cold in winter ( . mountains of the north and west to extreme heat in summer in the east of Khorasan. Everywhere there is a large difference in temperature between summer and winter. Except in portions of the Caspian provinces between theElburz range and the sea which are notoriously unhealthy, the climate is on the whole fairly salubrious and the air clear, healthy and dry, the central portion of Iraq-i-Aj am being perhaps the most favourable especially Isfahan, while the portions bordering on the desert suffer more from extremes and are much less attractive places. Temperature varies from 7° below zero in Azarbaljan in winter to 105° at Yazd in summer and more in the desert regions. The rainfall is very variable in different parts of the zone but generally is greatest on the Caspian watershed on the northern slopes of the Elburz. It ranges from 56 inches per annum at Rasht, 21 inches at Urumieh, 11 inches at Tehran to 6 inches at Meshed and only 3 at Isfahan and it falls most severely in the winter months, especially in spring and autumn. 10. Railways—At present there are no railways in Persia, ex cept the small local line at Tehran, but &lt;c) Communications. there ^ gign8 that before long several lines will be projected within the zone. There are no serious natural obstacles to their construction, except that any railway from the coast must climb to the elevated plateau. The most important and probable in the near future are as follows :— (a) Julfa-Tabrlz-Lake Urumieh. Russia has obtained from Persia a concession to commence this line. [h) Khaniqin-Hamadan-Tehran. This has been agreed on between Russia and Germany as an extension of the Baghdad railway. (c) The Trans-Persian Line, i.e., Baku -Rasht-Tehran-Isfa- han-Yazd. This project is being studied by an Interna tional Societe d'Etudes and will shortly come to the front of practical politics unless financially unsound. {d) Askhabad-Kuchan-Meshed. This is a Russian project which has not been pressed of late years and may be relegated to the more distant future. The settlement of schemes for the construction of railways in future is rendered difficult by the important strategical and politi cal questions involved and especially by possible attempts at partici pation by Powers other than Great. Britain and Russia. But for our part besides the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907 dividing Persia into spheres of influence as regards concessions, the Shah in 1888 gave Great Britain a pledge by which we consider that if Persia gives Russia a concession to construct a railway in the north, we can claim one to construct a similar line in the south.f' 5 1L Roads. —The few xoads in Persia suitable for wheeled traffic lie within this zone. Those on which carriages travel without diffi culty are:— (a) Julfa-Marand-Kh5I-Urumieh—mostly Persian. {b) Julfa-Tabrlz with a projected extension to Kazvin—Rus sian concession. (c) Rasht-Kazvin-Tehran—a Russian road. (d) Kazvln-Hamadan—a Russian road, (e) Tehran-Shahrud-Sabzawar-Meshed—a Persian road. (/) Askhabad-Kuchan-Meshed—part Russian part Persian. {g) Tehran-Qum-Sultinabad—British enterprise. (A) Qum-Kashan-Isfahan—British enterprise. In addition to the above there are various roads on which wheeled traffic is possible in parts and throughout with moderate labour, such as roads from Meshed to eastern frontier and from Kashan to Yazd. The remaining roads are either caravan or mule tracks which have existed from time immemorial Long stretches of sand, rough mountain tracks covered with boulders and loose jagged stones, slippery rocks, narrow defiles, and steep gradients are the characteristics of most Persian roads, while the numerous irrigation cuts which intersect the cultivated portions of the country would prove serious obstacles to troops moving off the beaten tracks. 12. These roads and their capacity for the movement of troopa will now be considered in more detail. (a) Roads running from the Turkish frontier:— (1) Bayazld-Khdi-Tabriz.—1871 miles in 17 stages. Thia is part of the great ca- Eontes in Persia. ravan route to Trebizond. Vol. II, route 117. The portion gayazld to Kh5i is passable by carts but the Dasht-i-Darreh is very difficult for them. The portion Kh5i-Tabrlz has two routes, one via Marand, the other north of Lake Urumieh, the former suitable for carts, the latter for camels. Water and supplies are procurable throughout in fair quantities and a division mighfc march in one echelon. (2) Rania-Urumieh-Khoi.—222| miles in 10 stages. This might be a main line Route 107 idem. tit of advance from eastern Turkey in Asia into north-west Persia. The route6 varies from good going over open level ground to steep ascents and descents through close hilly country or marshy swamps. It would require much labour ; to make it suitable for the passage of large forces. Except in the fertile Urumieh plain, supplies are limited but water is plentiful. The passes are blocked with snow in January and February. A brigade would probably have to march in 2 echelons at first until road was improved. \ (3) Khaniqin-Kirmanshah-Hamadan-Tehran.—420 milea in 27 stages. The main v -d.

The road from Astara- bad passes over the Quzluq pass (6,560) and though guns have been taken over, it is only suitable for mules throughout in its present condition. After Shahrud the road in general crosses desert except for cultivation round villages, it is never repaired but is passable for wheels throughout. Supplies are scarce throughout and water is brackish after Shahrud but fairly plentiful. A brigade could march in one echelon over the first part and a division over the second part if supplies were collected beforehand, but this would be very difficult. (9) Astarabad-Bustan-Shahrud-Sabzawar-M e s h e d.—310 Vol, I. routes 71,69. Jf' 1 ? »'(?) stages from Shahrud. The road is very similar to (8) and the same deduction may be8 made.

A brigade could march in one echelon. 13. Waterways and sea ports. —There are no inland water ways within the zone. On the Caspian Sea none but Russian steamers are allowed. Postal steamers visit the principal ports weekly in summer and fortnightly in winter. The principal ports are as follows :—Bandar-i-Gaz, the port of Astarabad Bay, consists of a few houses and a pier, 350 paces long and 8 feet wide^ reported suitable for landing of troops and guns. It would be very difficult for a force to march from here to Astarabld in the present state of the roads. The channel is well buoyed and ships of the largest size navigating the Caspian can enter in any state of the weather by day or night. The harbour is quite sheltered and can hold a large number of vessels. Mashad-i-Sar is a small badly built village with an open roadstead. There is no pier or wharf, steamers lie out some distance and passengers and cargo are transferred in flat- bottomed boats of which 40 exist. Enxali on the western sand spit and Gazian on the eastern one at the mouth of the Murdab form a port; there is a bar across the mouth. At Gazian there are wooden wharfs and two landing stages inside the bar alongside which steamers can load and discharge; but the mail steamers in all weathers lie outside and land passengers and goods in steam launches. In bad weather they do not stop. Ships drawing 7 or 8 feet can cross the bar in calm weather. There are over 1,000 boats of sorts at Enzali, and the harbour could bo rendered accessible to mail steamers by dredging the bar. Astara is situated on both banks of the river of that name which, forms the boundary between Russia and Persia. A bar of sand exists at the mouth and vessels have to lie a couple of miles out to sea. It is merely a landing place and a most unhealthy one, too. 14. Telegraphs. —The telegraph lines in Persia are classified under four separate headings :— (a) Those worked by an English staff forming the ' Indo- European Telegraph Department in Persia.' This is a British Government Department established in virtue of a number of conventions between the British and Persian Governments. (&amp;) The Indo-European Telegraph Company. This company works a line between Tehran and Julfa and is of British origin. (c) Persian lines maintained by (a).12 {d) Lines belonging to the Persian Government and worked by a Persian staff. The principal lines in the zone are :— 1. Tehran-Kashan-Ardistan-Isfahan (a), 2. Ardistan-Yazd (a), 3. Tehran-Julfa (6). 4. Tehran-Meshed (c). 5. Tehran-Khaniqin (c?). 6. Tehran-Khurramabad {d). 7. Tehran-Astarabad-Bujnurd-Meshed [d), 8. Meshed-Birjand {d). On the Russian roads Rasht-Tehran and Kazv'n-Hamadan there is telephonic communication between the post houses. 15. The government of the country consists of a Shah, at . . ' present the Regent, a Majlis or National («) Admmistra ion. Council which rarely sits, and a Cabinet, The latter is nominated by the Shah but must retain the con fidence of the Majlis and it really governs the country. Under the Cabinet, Persia is divided into Provinces, one or more of which are placed under a governor general. These provinces are divided into districts, sub-districts and parishes each in charge of officials subordinate to the governor-general. The tribes such as Kurds, Bakhtiari, etc., being under governors called Ilkhani, Ilbeg', etc., each under the governor general of the province in which they reside for the collection of revenue. As all these posts are sold to the highest bidder the administration is corrupt and inefficient. The dispensation of justice is always summary, but the Persian Government has no jurisdiction over foreigners who are tried by their own consuls, 16. The population of Persia is roughly estimated at about 10 (e) Population — its com- millions, of whom the larger half reside position and military value in the northern zone. It is supposed as containing fighting races, to be divided roughly as follows :— (1) Urban ». .. .. .. 2,650.000 ' (2) Rural .. .. .. .. 5,100,000 (3) Nomad .. .. .. .. 2,550,000 of whom 90 per cent, are Shiahs, 9 per cent. Sunnis and the remain ing 1 per cent of other religions. The first two classes are compos ed chiefly of Tajiks, Jews and Armenians. They are of small mili tary account, especially the townsfolk; they have been crushed by13 conquest and bad government and their brains and n.anhood have been sapped by excessive consumption of opium and by vice. But the nomad tribes are very important from a military point of view because they furnish the best fighting material in Persia. They may be roughly divided as follows :— Turks .. ♦. .. .. .. 969,600 Kurds and Laks .. ,. .. .. 909,000 Bakhtiaris and Lurs .. .. .. 315,120 Arabs .. .. .. .. .. 350,268 Baluchis and Gypsies .. ., ,, 27,887 Total ,. 2,571,875 They are much scattered all over Persia as it has been the policy of Government to separate them, but the two former sections are chiefly located in the northern zone and the others in the southern one. They are soldiers by nature, but difficult to discipline ; the Turks and Kurds are the best material of them all, some of the tribes being well-known fighters. 17. Arsenals and factories. —Arsenals are said to exist at Tehran, (/) Resourcea. Tabriz, Khoi, Urumieh, Isfahan, Meshed, Astarabad, Kirmanshah, Khurramabad and Rasht ; but it is doubtful if they contain much of any value. A cartridge factory exists at Tehran, but as the Werndl rifles have now been replaced by the French Lebel, the factory will have to be reorganised before it can be of any use. Practically all arms and ammunition are purchased in foreign countries. 18. Supplies. —The tables attached in Appendices give some of the principal resources of the country which are of military value. The north-west provinces are the richest, the corn resources of Azar- baijan are described as ' practically unlimitedcountless flocks of sheep and goats are owned by the nomad tribes, and 60,000 sheep and quantities of grain are exported annually. The surplus grain of the Kirmanshah province is estimated in a normal year to be 50,000 tons, and there are also large supplies in Iraq-i-Ajam. In Khorasan there is an estimated surplus of grain in an ordinary year of some 900,000 maunds, Kuchan being by far the most pro ductive district. There are also large quantities of cattle, sheep and goats in some districts. Rice is available in considerable quantities in Mazandaran along the shores of the Casp : an. It will thus be seen that under ordinary circumstances there are large quantities of supplies of all kinds available in this zone ; but that14 as tlioir distribution over the zone is very uneven, it may take a long time to collect them in certain centres^ 19. Transport. —Persia contains many horses nearly related to the Arab and its mules are celebrated for their excellencei Camels, however, are principally used for transport especially in the east of the zone, the finest come from Khorasan and Kazvln. Don keys and bullocks are also Used, but chiefly in the southern zone. Transport vehicles are scarce and there are none peculiar to the country. It is said that in Azarbaijan large numbers of mules, horses and camels are available, in MazandaraU only a few ponies ; Kirmanshah is a great mule-breeding district, while in Iraq-i-Ajam, mules, donkeys and camels can be had in large quantities. In Khorasan it is estimated tl at the following animals are available for hire: camels 17,800, mules and ponies 25,000, donkeys 40,000. It may thus be said that there is no lack of excellent transport animals within this zone if time be available for thok collection. 20. The lines and volumes of British and Russian trade are Foreian trade Sll0Wn g ra P hicall y on ma P. being the ^ g * total of the imports and exports. These graphic lines are based on the figures given in Table B which are taken from the'trade reports of 1909 to 1912 and of shipping returns, 1909-10. It will be seen that almost the whole &lt; f this trade within the northern zone is in the hands of Russia and that it now amounts to nearly 10 millions annually; France and Italy take silk cocoons : from the zone, but C reat Britain is able to do little beyond importing some Indian tea. This is due to the fact that—• (1) communications with Russia are comparatively easy; (2) the whole northern boundary of Persia marches with. Russian territory; (3) the habits and wants of the population along the boun- dary are nearly identical; (4) Russian trade is increased and bolstered up by artificial means while British trade is correspondingly handi capped. 21. Tehran (280,000) is the most important place in this zoney not only as the seat of Government and (h) Political: the import- the home of the foreign legations, but ais ° as ^ cent r from which interests in zone. roads radiate all over the country. It contains the headquarters of the Persian army and an arsenal and ammunition factory, although from15 a. European point of view all these are almost negligible factors in their present condition. Meshed (75,000) on the east, a great road centre and in a fairly fertile district is the most important p'ace in Khor'san; while on the west Tabriz (200,000), the capital of Azarbaijan, is the largest commercial emporium in Persia and is on the main road from Julfa to Tehran, ^Next in import ance in the east come Astarab'd (12,000) which might be made the base of an army operating from the Caspian in a very fertile but undeveloped district; Kuchan (10,000) and Shahrud (/ ,000) the centres of roads and fertile districts *, in the north, Rasht (40,000) owing to its position close to Enzali the main Persian port on the Caspian; in the west Kh5i (60,000) and Urumieh (35,000) on the main road on the west side of Lake Urumieh each in the centre of a fertile district. The former, with Marand, block the only place s at which the Mesho Dagh is pierced ^ by good roads from the Russian frontier to the north. Other important places in the south of the zone, either because they are on main roads or are the centres of fertile districts, are Kirm^nshah (80,000), feinneh (32,000) and Hamadan (50,000). 22. The Russians have great trade interests in this zone, a Russian Bank at Tehrln, roads they have made, etc.; while of the Persian debt of some £6,000,000, the Russian Government hold £3,300,000 and the Russian Bank £1,160,000. Their present and future interests are so great that in order to protect them they have placed troops in occupation of various places within the zone as detailed in Part II, mra. 5. 23. The British interests in this zone are of much less importance they have little trade there, but they have established the Imperial Bank of Persia with a capital of £650,000 and of the Peisian debt the British Government hold £320,000 and the Imperial Bank £690,000; while, besides the Telegraph concessions already men tioned, the Persian Transport Company have made the Tehran- Qum-Sultanabad road and have concessions for mr.kmg others, ^hey are also politically interested in preventing Russia approach ing the Afghan-Persian frontier. 24. The interests of other foreign countries in this zone are smaller Turkey has considerable trade interests, and political and strategical ones on the Urumieh frontier. Afghanistan has some trade interests, but she is chiefly concerned politically in frontier matters. Germany's interests are mainly prospective, but she16 topes soon to create both commercial and political interests with the aid of the advancing Baghdad-Khaniqln Railway. The Southern Zone. 25. The Southern Zone, or that portion of Persia lying to the (a) Physical features as south of the so-called Russian sphere affecting military opera- of influence, comprises the coast belt, tions, mountains, nvers, for- the mountainous region stretchinsr paral- ests, deserts, and lakes. i„i ^ i. i i- lei to the coast, and a portion of the great Iranian plateau. In it are included the provinces of Luristan, 'Arabistan, Fars, Laristan, Kirman, Southern Khorasan (includ ing Sistan), and Persian Baluchistan. 26. The principal physical features of this area are the mountain ranges, which, in continuation of the mountain system of Azar- baijan, enter the area at its north-western boundary and run general ly in a south-easterly direction parallel to the shores of the Persian Gulf into Baluchistan. In the vicinity of the Baluchistan border they decrease in height and are joined by a minor range from the north and thence continue, still parallel to the coast, till they dis appear as physical features in the valley of the Indus. . This moun tain system consists of several parallel ranges separated by narrow and tortuous valleys and forms the southern buttress of the Iranian plateau. The chief significance of these mountains lies in the barrier they impose to communications from the sea to Central Persia; and though not absolutely continuous, few practicable routes exist over them from the coast, such communications as there are lying over passes of 4,000' and upwards. There is little doubt, but that this barrier to communication from overseas is to a large extent responsible for the lack of development of Central Persia at the present day. 27. The only river of importance in the zone is the Karun, which, rising in the mountainous district of the Br.khtiarl country, drains the 'Arabistan plain and joins the Shatt-al-'Arab near Muhammareh after a course of some 700 miles. This river is unfordable to within some 50 miles of its source and is navigable as far as Ahwaz. Further details will be found in paragraph 37, Communications. Other rivers in the area are— The Ab-i-Diz, a considerable stream which rises nearBurajird and joins the Kariin near Dizful after a course of some 360 miles.17 The Hindian, which drains portion of Southern Aiabiatan and flows into the Persian Gulf north of Bandar Dilam. This stream is unfordable during the spring floods and is navigable for nati craft for a few miles from the sea. The Mand river, which flows into the Persian Gulf 65 miles south of Bushire and is fed by many tributaries flowing past Firiizabad, Lar, and Jahrum. These streams are generally un important, but even in the dry season may have some 2 feet ot water. Other streams in the area are mere hill torrents, sometimes, during wet weather or the melting of the snows, affording a consider able obstacle, but generally insignificant and they either disappear in one or other of the various deserts, or if they reach the sea, do so in such little volume as to be of no account as possible water ways. 28. The principal stretch of inland water in the area is the S stan Hamun. This is a lake formed by depressions in and around Sistan which is fed by four rivers all flowing from the mountains of Afghanistan the principal of which is the Helmand. In winter the lake is contracted and the marshy edges covered with reeds , in the summer the lake area expands owing to the melting of the snows in Afghanistan which brings the rivers down in flood. The area under water varies from 1.474 to 2» ^42 square miles accoidmg to the season of the year. The result is that in t ie summer the Hamun area is practically impassable and in the winter it still offers considerable obstacles to the passage of troops. It has been claimed that the Hamun could be drained by diverting the waters of the Helmand into the Shelag Hamum a large salt lake in Afghan territory which is said to be 1,000' below the level of the Helmand and which now receives the overflow of the Hamun, via the Shelag river. This, howerve, requires investigation before it can be substantiated. The Daria -i-Ninz or Lake Nargis is a depression in the soil some 35 miles east of Shiraz. It is fed by the river Kur, and, in early spring, is 60 miles in length and some 3-5 miles in breadth. In the dry season, however, the water almost entirely disappears leaving a soft marshy surface with a little water in the centre. The water of this lake is salt. The Jaz-i-Murian Hamun between Bampur and Khanu is of a similar character and practically dries up in the hot weather. 29. Next in importance to the mountain ranges as a physical feature in this zone is the Dasht-i-Lut, an extensive desert com prising part of the Khorasan province and separating Kirman from Sistan, This desert, which is roughly included in the area •S248GSB18 marked by the towns of Neh, Tabas, Yazd and Kirman lies at an elevation of from l,200'-3,000' above sea level. Owing to the almost total absence of water it forms an insurmountable obstacle to the movement of troops except in very small bodies along the few caravan routes which traverse it. 30. Generally speaking the southern half of Persia is barren, sparsely populated and lacking in water and food supplies. In the mountainous districts cultivation is confined to the valleys separating the various ranges, and these are usually of limited extent. In contrast, however, to the greater part of the country, the province of 'Arabistan consists mainly of alluvial plain, which is watered by the Kariin river and geographically may be considered as part of the Mesopotamian plain. This province is in part well cultivated and produces considerable quantities of grain. The province of Sistan also, or that portion of it which is irrigated by the waters of the Helmand, is exceedingly fertile, producing even in its present undeveloped state a considerable surplus of grain. This district shows signs of having enjoyed great prosperity iii former times, and it is generally agreed that, with improved methods and administration, it could again become a prosperous grain pro ducing country. Other districts in which a relatively large amount of supplies can be anticipated are the Narmashir district the immediate vicinity of Shiraz, and, in a lesser degree, perhaps the country around Kirman and Bampur. 31. The southern portion of Persia is singularly lacking in forests. In the north-west portion some of the mountain ranges are covered with oak scrub, but further eastwards the hills are generally rocky and barren, covered at best with thorn bushes. In the valleys of Fars and Kirman extensive orchards are found in some places, but owing to lack of method and the ruthless destruc tion of trees by the inhabitants, a scarcity of wood fuel is to be anti cipated in the greater part of the country, especially in the eastern districts. 32. Islands. The following are the islands along the Persian littoral:— Abbadan island formed by two channels at the mouth of the Shatt-al-'Arab is 40 miles long and in width varies from U to 12 miles. The interior is mostly desert, but the margins are'covered with valuable date plantations. It belongs to the Muhammareh district and is reported to have a population of 24,000 mostlv Arabs. ' ' •' Kharij is an unimportant island north-west of Bushire some 4 by 2 miles in extent. The climate is reported as salubrious. It19 wag occupied by the British from 1838 to 1842 and was also used for hospital purposes by our troops in 1856-57. Shaikh Shu'aib, Hindarabi, and Qais are unimportant islands o5 the Shibkuh coast, inhabited mainly by fishermen and pearl-divers. Qishm is the most important island in the Persian Gulf, subtend ing the coast from Lingeh to Bandar 'Abbas. It is 68 miles long and averages about 10 miles wide. The population is estimated at 13,500, mostly Arabs. The town of Qishm at the eastern extremity of the island has a population of 3,000. At the western extremity is situated the naval station of Basldu, which was occupied by the British in 1823. It is now used as a coaling station in con nection with the arms traffic. The chief significance of this island lies in the sheltered anchorages it affords in Clarence Strait, which separates it from the Persian coast. Hanjam island is separated from Qishm by a narrow strait about I mile wide, and is practically uninhabited except for the British telegraph station for the Gulf submarine cable. Hormuz island, the site of an ancient civilization, is situated II miles south-east of Bandar 'Abbas, but is now inhabited by, at most, 1,200 souls. ^ Larak island, 10 miles south-east of Qishm town, is also prac tically uninhabited. All the above islands present the same characteristics of lack of sweet water and vegetation ; the climate, though perhaps slightly less severe than on the mainland, is similar to that of the coast belt of the Gulf. The last three, however, are of some strategical im portance owing to their position at the mouth of the Persian Gulf. 33. As is usual in mountainous countries, there is considerable (6) Climate. variation of climate in Southern Persia. The coast belt, that is to say, the narrow strip between the coast and the mountains, seldom attaining a depth of 40-50 miles, while in places the mountains run close to^he sea, enjoys the unenviable reputation of being one of the hottest regions in the world. The heat from June to September is almost intoler able, the only mitigation being the proximity of the hills, to which a large part of the population migrate. Eain falls usually in the cold season, from November to March, and then in inconsiderable quantities. The climate of the 'Arabistan plain is similar and is generally described as resembling that of the Indus valley. In the uplands the climate resembles that of Quetta. Snow falls on the mountains above 4,000' but seldom lies for any time at this alti tude. Generally speaking, the climate is worse in the eastern por-20 tions, where, as Baluchistan and Makran are entered, the country becomes more desert and and. The climate of Sistan is notoriously trying, owing to the great variations of temperature experienced. Spring and autumn are the seasons most suitable for military operations ; the heat of 'Arabistan, the coast belt, Sistan, he Dasht- i-Lut and the low-lying portions of Persian Baluchistan would render military operations during the summer almost impracticable, while the cold and snow in the mountain regions would seriously hamper the movement of troops during the winter. The most common diseases are malaria of the usual Indian type and opthalmia, which, owing to the dust and glare, is pre valent over the greater part of the country. Venereal is very com mon in all Persian towns and a form of skin disease, known as the Baghdad ulcer, is prevalent in the Karun valley. 34. Railways. —At present there are no railways in Southern Persia, but several projects have been (c) Communications. mooted. The trend of the mountains mentioned in paragraph 26 is a great obstacle to railway connection from the Gulf ports to Central Persia, as few passages through these mountains exist, which would admit of railway construction. The following are the principal lines which have been discussed (i) Khur Musa -Muhammareh-Dizful-Khurramabad-Hama- adan line.—A concession for the construction of this line has been put forward by a British syndicate and includes the right to construct a commercial port at Khur Musa. The matter is being pressed on the Persian Government and a concession for a line will probably be granted, at least as far as Dizful, now that the project mentioned in paragraph 10 (a) has been granted to Kussia. (n) The continuation of the Trans-Persian railway from Y aZ( i. The proposed alignment of this railway is still under discussion, the alternatives put forward being from Isfahan to Bandar 'Abbas either via Shiraz or Yazd and thence along the coast to Karachi; or, via Kirman -KTgan-Bampur-Chahbar (or Gwatar) to Karachi. (m) Bushire-Shiraz via Jahrum. {iv) Bandar 'Abbas-Lar-Jahrum-Shiraz. The two latter being alternatives for connecting Shiraz with the coast, a further extension from Shiraz to Is fahan being considered possible.(!5 21 [v) Bandar 'Abbas-Minab-Rigan-Kirman. (vi) Chahbar (or Gwatar)-Bampur. In accordance with the pledge given to Great Britain m 1888, mentioned in paragraph 10, all the above railways would probably be constructed under British auspices ; except the Trans-Persian railway, which, if existing arrangements stand, would be built by international enterprise. 35. Southern Persia may be said to be practically destitute of made roads fit for wheeled transport. In the less mountainous parts of the countrv, such roads as exist are generally passable for wheeled artillery with the aid of some pioneer work, but the transport of troops would usually be restricted to pack animals, while many of the routes in the more mountainous districts are ht for mules only. 36. The principal routes in the area are :— (1) Muhammareh-Ahwaz-ShCstar-Dizful-Khurr a m a b a d - Burujird, 401 miles in 28 Eoutes in Persia. ^ stages. As f ar as Ahwaz, 82 \ Vol. Ill, routes 87, 70,88. m ^ eSj route is level and suitable for carts, but water transport on the Karun river would usually be employed on this section. Ahwaz- ■ Dizful, 99 miles, is passable by carts in parts and could easily be made so throughout. Supplies and water plentiful. From Dizful-Buruj ird, 220 miles, it is describ ed as a fair mule track. Water plentiful, but supplies and fuel scarce. Its capacity as far as Dizful may be ■ taken as a division marching in one echelon; beyond that depots would have to be stocked or supplies carried for troops. Connects with routes 4 {i) and 22 paragraph 12. (2) Ahwaz-Isfahan, 276 miles in 18 or 20 stages. This is known as the Lynch road, having been constructed by Messrs. Lynch &amp; Co. on \ol. II j , route 69. a concession for certain tolls from the Persian Government. For the first 42 miles this road is said to be fit for wheeled transport and after that for mules and camels. It is liable to be blocked by snow during January and February. Sup plies are very variable and could not be counted on in any large quantities ; at most stages sufficient for 100 men and 500 animals for one day. Except for a sec-22 tion of 57 miles water is good and plentiful, but fuel is generally scarce. Depots would have to be stocked or supplies carried for troops. (3) Ahwaz-Ramuz-Behbehan-Shiraz, 302| miles in 25 stages. As far as Behbehan, 126 Vol. II, route 5. miles, the route is easy and supplies and water plentiful but lies in marshy and un healthy country.

Generally used Vol. IV, route 143. ^ donkeys and a few camels, but difficult in wet weather owing to numerous streams and water courses. Supplies generally scanty as is fuel. Water plentiful on most stages. Capacity would not exceed 2 battalions without previous prepa ration to collect supplies. Alternative route 338 miles via Khanu-Murghak-Rayin is used in winter, but it is of the same general character and supplies probably even scarcer. (12) Bandar 'Abbas-Rigan-Nasratabad, 526 miles in 28 stages. The main route Vol. IV, routes 139, 70. from the coast to Sistan and Afghanistan, From Bandar 'Abbas to Rigan it is generally fit for camel transport. Supplies are practi cally unobtainable till within a few marches of Rigan. Water generally sufficient except on a few stages.24 From Eigan to Sistan the track lies across the Lut desert for some 60 miles and though easy is lacking in supplies and water. The movements of troops over this route may be considered impracticable, unless preceded by considerable preparations as regards stocking depots. (13) Chahbar-Bampur, 221 miles in 15 stages.

Routes (18) and (19) connect with routes 16 and 17, para. 12 respectively from Meshed. j 37 The only inland waterway in Southern Persia is the Karua rivet 'mentionea in patagtaph 27. This river is navigable as far as Alwaz for vessels of 5-9' draught, though steamers drawing 3i .ometimeshave difficulty in negotiating the last 20 m.les below Ahwaz The river is not navigable at Ahwaz owing to some 2,000 . of rapids, where cargo is usually transferred to a tramway foi- transportation. From Ahwaz the river is navigable to withm gome 7 miles of Shustar for light draught steamers, as is also its tributary the Ab -i-Diz to withm about 14 miles of Dizful. At Dresent three steamers with a capacity of some 100 tons each ply from Muhammareh to Ahwaz ; while on the upper reaches two steamers of somewhat less capacity ply from Ahwaz as far as the state of the river admits. Other craft of shallow draught might also be available from the Shatt -al-'Arab, Communication between the ports on the Gulf is, owing to the bad land communications, mamly carried on by sea. Such traffic is mainly in the hands of the British India Steam Navigation Company and other British firms trading m these waters. 38. The following are the principal sea ports on the Persian shore of the Gulf and the Arabian Sea:— Muhammareh, at the point where the Muhammareh, Karun j 0 i n s the Shatt-al-'Arab. Roadstead.—Tbe anchorage for small steamers is a J mile from the landing place and cannot be used when the Karun is in S248GSB26 flood (usually in March and April, but sometimes earlier). Larger steamers anchor near the left bank of the Shatt-al-'Arab. Here could find moorings in single line. Coast.—The left bank of the Shatt-al-'Arab is fairly steep but low becoming more shelving in the Karun. The beach is mud with no cliffs, Landing places for troops can be found anywhere on either side of the Karun or Shatt-al-'Arab, from barges or launches. The 13ahmanshir might also be utilized. No special arrangements are necessary, except a supply of 30' planks. Landing facilities.—Some 250 native craft with a capacity from 20—100 men or 10—50 tons of stores are usually available. 100 yards of wharves exist and considerable storage accommodation is available near the wharves. Convoy grounds are situated behind the date groves in rea* of the Consulate, 600 yards from the river, The soil is alluvial, but there is no grazing, . Prinking water is from the Karun only. A supply of pumps, piping and canvas troughs is necessary. Camping grounds. There is ample ground on either side of K ^ ru ° above tlie Bahmanshir channel, and on the new canal one mile from the town. The neighbourhood of the town is in sanitary The ground, on both banks of the river, is liable to flood during March and April. The Shaikh of Muhammareh lives four miles further up the Shatt-al-'Arab, at Failieh, where he maintains an escort of 300 men armed with Martinis. The Shaikh is at present friendly and supreme here, and assistance in the wav of supplies, transport, etc., would depend on political relations with Khur Musa is a remarkable inlet of the sea, which leaves the Khur Musa, Persian Gulf at its northern extremity „ , to the east of the Shatt-al-'Arah nnrl affords easy access to Buzieh and Ma'shur. The channel begins in the sea at a distance from land. The entrance is crossed ^bv a bar, carrying only 3 fathoms at low water spring tides but is practicable for large vessels at high water. The bottom'is mud and could easily be dredged. Inside the bar the depth steadilv increases, and from a point at a little over 11 miles from the en^ trance up to the head of the main Khur therp m Wf throughout at 9 fathoms. The Khur Musa proper is navigable ' Iar e e ve86els ' ^ a branch called the Khui Qanaqeh. which27 takes of! west at 29 miles, is navigable for a distance of 7 miles^ The only difficulty arises from the invisibility of the edges of the channel except at low water. The principal anchorages are com pletely protected from all winds, and easily defended against attack from the open sea. Water is procurable from the Jarrahi river, and the climate is less trying than in some parts of the Gulf* The chief natural anchorage might require adaptation to form a good harbour ;'and the bar would require dredging to admit ships at all states of the tide. Roadstead.—-The inner anchorage is If miles from the Customs House landing place in Khur Sultani. Buahire. There is room for mooring 15 or 17 vessels of the British India type in 18' of water. The outer anchor age is 4 to 5 miles from the shore, and has room for a large num ber of steamers in 4 to 5 fathoms. Coast.—The coast is shelving, generally sandy, but rocky in places. Cliffs run from the south end of the town for | mile to the south. Thence no more cliffs ocour till Rishahr, 5| miles south of Bushire. Entrance to harbour.—The shoal water between the outer and inner anchorages forms a bar, and vessels drawing over 13' should wait for half tide. There is 11' water at low springs, 17' at high water springs, and 16' at high water neaps. Tugs and launches.—Only the Persian Customs and British Residency have launches. Dredging.—The port would be greatly improved by dredging. Landing places for troops.—In addition to the usual landing place at the Customs House, a landing can be effected almost anywhere on the beach to the south of the town. A convenient place at Bushire itself is abreast the town Residency, on a sandy and rocky beach. The most convenient place outside the town is a natural landing stage, below the cable house at Rishahr point. Boats can get alongside at any state of the tide, but landing here would be impossible if the south-east wind were blowing hard, as the surf often becomes dangerous. The embarkation and disembarkation of animals from June to September when the monsoon swell runs up the Gulf would present considerable difficulties. Landing facilities.—About 100 harbour boats with a capacity of 30—50 men are usually available. There are no wharves, but considerable storage accommodation in commetcial godowns.- 28 Convoy grounds.—Plenty of space is available to the south of the town, about 500 to 1,000 yards from the store depots. There is no real grazing ground near ; the water, though brackish, is fit for animals. Mules used on the road always camp some 10 miles out near Ahmadi, where there is grazing. Camping grounds.—The best camping ground would be on the high ground in the neighbourhood of the Imamzadch, the Sabz- ab5d Residency, and Rishahr. This position commands the whole town and approaches. Water is said to be plentiful, and the best obtainable in the peninsula. The site is the most healthy in the neighbourhood. Water.—All water in Bushire city is so brackish and bad, that it is advisable, if the health of the troops is to be maintained, that condensing apparatus should be supplied. Pumps, cisterns and troughs would also be necessary. See camping grounds $bove. Roadstead,—Ships drawing up to 17 feet can anchor 2 miles Bandar 'Abbas. beaC !;; ^, hel ' e is an borage at 4 fathoms, 2| miles out, for 2 miles each side of the town. Ships approach and anchor on the lead. Holding ground is good, being sand and mud. During a strong south-east wind, there is considerable surf on the beach. Steamers usually anchor in the vicinity of a buoy, about 2 miles from shore on edge of the 3-fathom line. Gunboats could anchor a mile from the landing place opposite the town. There is anchor age for a large number of ships, which never becomes dangerous. No fixed moorings are provided. Coast is very gently shelving sand, hence the distance of the anchorage. The beach is of sand and mud, and very soft, without cliffs. At low tide the shore is so flat that small boats take the ground 100 yards from the water's edge. Launches.—The Customs have two launches, one 85' long drawing 6', and new in 1906, The concessionaire of Hormu^ island has one launch. Dredging.—The locality is not adapted for dredging, unless undertaken on a large scale in connection with harbour works. Landing places for troops.—The best point would be opposite the Consulate at Naiband. The cosst is very shelving, but the beach hard and firm below high-water mark. Above is a ridge of29 gaffe #and 10' high, and beyond a plain of loose sand, very difficult for carta or even men or mules, The nearest camping ground IB 400 yards distant in a palm grove, 200 yards south-west of the Consulate. Landing could be effected at any point up to 3 miles west of the town, or 9 or 10 miles east, but it would be through surf in small boats, and the troops would have to wade a long dis tance at low water. The surf is only dangerous with a strong gale, bad weather seldom lasts more than 2 days at a time. Ad vantage should be taken of high water to land stores. There is no estuary in the vicinity which could be used. Landing facilities.—Poor, very few suitable boats available. No wharves and a dilapidated pier which is left high and dry at low water. Poor storage accommodation near pier. Convoy grounds.—There is ample open space to the east, and | mile to the north-east of the Customs pier, outside the town. Brackish water is obtainable by sinking wells, but good drinking water is only to be had at Naiband, miles distant. Grazing is not procurable anywhere near. Water is distant, not abundant, and either brackish or impure. The best for drinking is obtained from the shallow wells at Naiband, If a force of 2,000 men were landed, a base dep6t would have \ to be maintained here, however rapidly the force moved jnto the interior, so a condensing ship, or plant ashore would be necessary, Camping ground.—Large open space, sandy, well drained, and flat, exists all around Naiband and close to the water- supply. Roadstead,—The anchorage at Chahbar is exposed to the moft# soon, and dangerous during that seasoft, a ar ' Large numbers of ships, drawing up to 20', could anchor in calm weather about 2 miles from the beach. Good shelter from the monsoon exists to the north of Has Kgjblab, where there is deep water. The distance round the bay by iand to Chahbar is 28 miles. Coast—The coast, south of the promontory on which Chahbaf is situated, is rocky and consists of cliffs 10' to 50' high. North of the promontory is a sandy beach, varying in breadth from 10 yards at the point to 200 yards opposite the village. The water north, of the promontory is shallow, except for a distance of 800 yardf opposite the village, where boats drawing 5' can approach to withm 20 yards of shore, even at low tide. - - - - - -30 Boats.—About 20 boata, carrying 20 men each, are available here and at Tiz; also 20 canoes capable of carrying 4 to 6 men. There are about 20 baghlehs drawing 7' to 9', capable of carrying 100 men each. No tugs or launches. Landing troops, etc., by boats.—For this only the 800 yards of beach opposite the village is available. No facilities exist, but stone suitable for the construction of landing stages can be quarried about 800 yards west of the telegraph buildings. Camping and convoy grounds are capacious and well situated on high level ground. Water.—There are 3 wells in a garden, situated | mile from the telegraph station, which give a supply of excellent water. They are soon exhausted, but rapidly refill, and their capacity should meet the requirements of a battalion. The water is pumped into a re servoir and pipes lead to the telegraph quarters. The remaining wells in Chahbar are brackish, and the supply barely suffices for the village. Other ports of less importance and with fewer facilities than those mentioned above are Bandar Dilam, Lingeh, Jask, and Gwatar. Supplies are generally scarce at all ports, except perhaps Muham- mareh, and troops would be dependent mainly for supplies from ships and in most cases condensing apparatus for water would be required. &gt; 39. Telegraphs and Cables. —The general system of telegraphs in the country is outlined in paragraph 14, The principal lines in the Southern Zone are:— Isfahan-Shiraz-Bushire. Yazd-Kirman-Bam-Kuh-i-Malik Siah, connecting with the Indian system at Nushki. J ask-Chahbar-Gwadar. Birjand-Nasratabad. The first three are worked by the Indo-European Telegraph Department; the last belongs to the Persian Government and is worked by Persian officials^31 The following is the list of cables in the Arabian Sea and the Per sian Gulf:— i, From • To Length in sea miles.

Hanjam Bandar 'Abbas 40 Persian Government. t; Wireless telegraphy. —In connection with the arms traffic block ade operations, temporary wireless telegraph stations were erected in 1909 at Jask and Bushire. In 1912 the Secretary of State for India sanctioned the erection, by the Indo-European Telegraph Department, of permanent wireless telegraph stations at Hanjam, Bushire, Kuwait, Bahrain, and Zora (Pirate Coast of 'Oman), The installation of these stations is now being undertaken, 40. The general administration of Persia is outlined in para- (c) Administration. g ra ph 15 dealing with the Northern Zone. ' As regards the Southern Zone the Sheikh of Muhammareh is the virtual ruler of Southern 'Arabistan, though he acknowledges the nominal authority of the Persian Government. The headquarters of the Governor-Generals of Provinces in the Southern Zone are as follows:— 'Arabistan and Bakhtiari country ... Shushtar. Fars .. •• •• .. Shiraz. Kirman and Baluchistan -■-&lt; «. ... Kirman.ss Bistafiform^paH of the Province of EBOfasafl for adinims- trative purposes, and the Governor, locally known as Atnif# is subordinate to the Governor-General of that province; There is also a Governor-General of the Gulf ports with headquarters 8t Bushire. Owifig possibly to the greater distance from the seat of Government, administration is even more laX in the south than in the north of Persia. Another contributory cause for the general lawlessness is the large influx of modern rifles and ammunition, which has taken place during the past few years; the increase of power which this has given to the tribes bor dering on the Gulf littoral having enabled them to defy the in efficient Government forces at the disposal of the provin cial authorities. In Southern 'Afabistan the Sheikh of Muham- inareh has managed to preserve fair order, and the Khans of the Bakhtiari country have also kept their tribesmen in hand to some extent. In other provinces, however^ the authority of the governors hardly extends beyond the walls of their head quarter towns, and the chiefs of the various clans ate a law unto themselves, prosecuting their petty quarrels and levying blackmail in open defiance of constituted authority. This is especially the Case in the south-eastern portion of the country, where Persian authority has been non-existent for some yeats, while the situation in Fars is little bettef. 41. The population of Persia as a whole has been given irt n i . • t paragraph 16 dealing with the Northern Sition ah /military valued Z , one - . As regards the Southern Zone, containing fighting men, ^he principal tribes of potential military value are:— Bakhtiari tribe occupying the country on the north-west bor der of the zone. Kuhgalu tribes to the south-east of the above. Arab tribes occupying 'Arabistan and the lower Kariln valley. Qashqai tribes occupying the country round Shiraz. , Owing to the recent influx of arms of precision into Persia, all the above tribes are relatively well armed. Their power of offence out- Bide their own districts, however, would be small, and, even in their own districts, it is improbable that large bodies could be kept in the field for any lengthy period. A religious war might cause the several factions to make common cause togetherj but inter*-tribal and33 inter-section feuds are common. Especially is there bad feeling between the Arabs of 'Arabistan and the Bakhtiari. The tribes in habiting Kirman, Sistan, and Persian Baluchistan, though also fairly armed, are less formidable than those mentioned above. Generally, the population towards the east is scantier and more scattered. Probably, the Baluchis would be the best fighting men in the eastern section, but the inhabitants of Kirman and Sistan are notorious for their unwarlike qualities. Detailed estimates of the fighting men of each tribe and their armament is given in Table E. 42. Arsenals. —Arsenals in the Southern Zone are said to exist (e) Resources. at Shiraz, Shushtar Kirman, and Bushire, but it is doubtful if they contain any material of value. The chief source of supply of arms and ammuni tion is from the Gulf ports, where the arms can be landed with permission for Government forces, while the tribes are mainly dependent on the illicit arms traffic for warlike supplies. . 43 • Sullies.—The figures in Table A give an estimate of the principal resources of the country which are of military value. The greater portion of Southern Persia is unfertile and destitute of surplus supplies available for troops. It is generally considered, however, that with good government the country is capable of considerable development, and that with a system of irrigation much waste land could be brought under cultivation. As regards the more fertile districts, it is estimated that'Arabistan could 3 per manently support some 20,000 men and further supplies mighfc be imported into this area by water from Mesopotamia. The lower portion of the Bakhtiari country is estimated as capable of supplying 6,500 men, while the hilly districts support large numbers of sheep and goats. The vicinity of Shlraz is also very fertile and could, with a good system of collection, probably support some 10,000 men. The immediate vicinity of Kirman, the prov ince of i\ armaslrr, and, in a lesser degree, the neighbourhood of Bampur are districts in which a moderate surplus food-supply might be expected. S r stan is also a very fertile area though at present not developed to anything like its full capacity. It is estimated that food-supplies for 2 divisions and transport would normally be available in this area. . Transport. Table A gives an estimate of the resources in horses and transport animals in the various districts. It is said •S248 GSb® 1118outh - West Persia decreased considerably• \ u Iof late years. Persian donkeys are celebrated for their size and strength, as are also the mules. Mules are used r.lmost exclusively i in the mountainous districts of South-West Persia. In South-Fast Persia, owing to lack of water and forage, camels are more used. The best camels are those bred in and imported from Khorasan, the Baluchistan camel being smaller and capable of carrying loads of 320—400 lbs. only. Practically no wheeled transport vehicles are obtainable in Southern Persia. 45. The lines and volume of trade are shown graphically on map. ... ^ . , , These lines show the total of imports (/) foreign ra e. and exports and are based on the trade reports of 1909-10, 1910-11, 1911-12, and the shipping returns of 1909-10. It will be seen that practically the whole trade of Southern Persia is in British hands, owing to the maritime preponderance we have built up in the Persian Gulf. The difficulty of communica tion with the interior is a great handicap to any prospect of increased trade in Persia; and it is doubtful if such trade, as exists, could stand the competition with Russian trade should their railway system be extended into the central districts, without a corresponding improvement of communications with the coast. A significant feature as regards British trade is that imports are nearly five times as great as exports. This would appear to indicate that un less the natural resources of the country are capable of considerable development, a large increase to our trade is improbable, as with out some increase of national wealth the country can hardly continue to pay cash for such a great disparity between imports and exports. The principal British interests involved are given in paragraph 47. (^) Political; the importance ^6. The following are the chief con- of certain centres, historical, tres of population and places of politi- political, and foreign interests cal and strategical importance in the in zone. Southern Zone :— Ispahan (80,000), the ancient capital of Persia, is situated on central plateau at an elevation of 5,300. It lies on the main route from Tehran to South Persia and is a considerable road centre and emporium for trade. Yazd (60,000), lies 200 miles south-east of Isfahan on the route from Meshed to Bandar 'Abbas. It ranks next to Isfahan as the chief trading mart in Central Persia. The local resources are, however, very poor.35 Khummabad (2,000), is the only town of any importance in the Bakhtiari country. Shushtar (20,000) and Dizfiil (45,000) are the chief places of im portance in Northern'Arabistan and are centres by which the trade of this province is carried on with the sea via the Karun river. Shiraz (60,000) is the capital of the province of Fars and a place of considerable political importance. It is situated in a very fer tile valley, but, except in the direction of Isfahan, communications are difficult in all directions. Behbehan (7,000), Niriz (10,000), Jahrum (10,000), Kazarun (4,000) and Firuzabad (3,000) are other towns of some importance in the Province of Fars. Lar (8,000) is the capital of Laristan but a place of minor importance. Kirman (50,000), the capital of the province of that name, is an important trade and road centre. Owing to the existence of minerals in the mountains in its vicinity it is probable that, in the event of railway construction, Kirman will increase considerably in size and importance. Saidabad (9,000) and Bam (13,000) are the only other places of note in this province. In Persian Baluchistan there are few places of any importance, Bampur as a road centre and situated in a relatively fertile district being the principal town. Nasratabad is the capital of Sistan, but although fortified is only a village of some 300 families. The seaports Muhammareh (6,000), Bushire (15,000), Bandar 'Abbas (10,000), and Chahbar (2,300) have been described in some detail in paragraph 38. 47, Foreign interests. —As has been previously noted in dis cussing the trade of Persia, foreign interests in the Southern Zone are almost exclusively British. The following are the chief British interests of a more or less permanent nature:— The Indo-European Telegraph Department which works the telegraph lines in Persia as described in paragraph 14. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company, which holds an exclusive concession to bore for oil in Persia except in the provinces of Azarbaijan, Gilan, Mazandaran, Astarabad and Khorasan. The Imperial Bank of Persia referred to in paragraph 23, has branches in the Southern Zone at Isfahan, Nasratabad, Kirman, Yazd, Shiraz, Bushire and Muhammareh.36 Messrs. Lyncli and Co. have large interests in Mesopotamia and South-West Persia. Their steamers ply on the navigable portion of the Karun river, and this firm has con structed the road from Ahwaz to Isfahan which is one of the main arteries of British trade. The Persian Transport Company also hold valuable conces sions for road-making. It is also probable that a conces sion for the construction of a railway from Khur Musa to Dizful-Khurramabad-Burujird will be granted to the Persian Railways Syndicate in the near future. The Persian Railways Syndicate is negociating for a mining concession to cover a large tract of country of which Kirman is roughly the centre. In addition to the above most of the trade in the Persian Gulf is carried in British ships and the trade at the sea ports is largely in the hands of British and Indian firms. The interests of other nations in the Southern Zone are inconsi derable, except for a fair volume of trade between 'Arabistan and Mesopotamia. On the completion of the Baghdad Railway and its connection to Khaniqin, we may, however, see a determined effort by Germany to divert the existing sea-borne trade from the head of the Gulf to her railway system across Asia Minor. M esopotamia, 48. It is only proposed to consider Lower Mesopotamia, the country from Baghdad to the Per- (a) Physical features as si an Gulf, as the upper portion hardly affecting military operations, affects the problem dealt with in this deserts^etc. merS ' Stud y-. This ton g ue of land ' as its name implies, consists mainly of the flat country lying between the rivers Tigris and Euphrates though impor tant parts of the province lie outside this area. The best name for the whole zone described would be Turkish Iraq. On the north east it is bounded by the Pusht-i-kuh and Zagros Mountains which separate it from Persia and on the south-west by the deserts of Arabia; while the tip of the tongue, where the united rivers discharge into the sea, rests on the Persian Gulf and the root runs on to the Turkish mountains of Kurdistan. It is much subject to inundations from the rivers, which cause many marshes to form; but otherwise is a dry steppe, except in the wet season. Little remains of the vast irrigation systems of the ancients, though Sir William Willcocks hopes to restore them.37 49. Tlie rivers Euphrates and Tigris, flowing near and through Baghdad respectively from the north-west, close to within some 30 miles of each other and then open out again until they unite at Qurneh above Basrah. Thence they form the Shatt-al-'Arab and fall into the Persian Gulf near Fao. 50. There are no forests and the country is almost bare of trees except for vast plantations of date-palms along the lower reaches of the Euphrates and Tigris and the Shatt-al-'Arab. The country has gradually been filled in by the alluvia of the great rivers and the advancing sands of the desert. The soil is a sandy clay, very fertile and incaj^able of cultivation only where water is lacking. It is, at present, but little cultivated. The population relies mainly on the produce of its flocks and herds, which find good grazing in the spring even in the so-called desert country. 51. The climate is trying and not very healthy especially to- wards the Persian Gulf. In the upper (b) C imate. portion the temperature varies from 122° in summer to 14° in winter and it is very dry in summer with terribly hot winds. Vegetation, except in irrigated areas, begins in November with the winter rain and ends in July. The rainfall at Basrah is about 6 inches per annum, at Baghdad it is even less. March to May are the months of floods. Fevers are prevelant in the autumn. 52. Railways. —There are no railways at present, but a 4' , , „ • + - . gauge line is under construction by the (c) ommumca ion . Baghdad Railway Company from Asia Minor which is expected to reach Baghdad via the valley of the Tigris in five years from the summer of 1912. An extension has been agreed on by Germany and Russia from Baghdad to Khaniqin which will go up the valley of the Diala river to the Persian frontier. The exact terms of this concession have not, it is believed, yet been settled with Turkey, but like the Baghdad Railway it will probably be almost entirely a German line. The Baghdad-Persian Gulf section has been- sur rendered by the Company in return for a concession to build a port at Alexandretta together with a branch line to that port from Osmanieh on the main line. The extension from Baghdad to Basrah is now under discussion between the Turkish and British Govern ments ; but if any non-Turkish capital is subscribed for its construc- sion, Germany must be given as large a share as any other nation. 53. Roads. —There are practically no roads in the country, though Baghdad is the centre of carriage and caravan routes to Khorasan,38 up tlie Euphrates to Syria and the Mediterranean, and up the Tigris to Armenia and the Black Sea. Routes also run into Arabia. North-west of Basrah the swamps confine existing communica tions to the channels of the Tigris and Euphrates. The only land routes of any interest are given below :— (1) Baghdad-Khdniqin —94| miles in 3 stages. This is the main caravan and trade route between Mesopotamia and Persia, it is quite passable for wheels in dry weather. But it runs over rich alluvial soil liable to inundation and one inch of rain makes the country impassable. A Baghdad carriage company keeps the road in fairly good order. It crosses low hills towards Khaniqln. Supplies and water are plentiful and a brigade could march in one echelon. (2) Umm asr-Safwdn-Basrah —47 miles in 3 stages. A good track pa-sable for wheeled artillery. No supplies, but water is sufficient for a brigade with its transport. A brigade could march in one echelon. (3) Fdo-Basrah —67 miles in 4 stages. This route lies along the right bank of the Shatt-al-'Arab by keeping along the edge of the desert behind the palm groves which fringe the bank. It makes many detours to avoid the heads of tidal creeks which run inland. Supplies scarce, but water is obtainable in large quantities from the Shatt-al-'Arab and its tributaries. Wheeled artillery might pass along it with great difficulty. A brigade would have to march in 2 echelons. (4) Muhammareh-Basrah—25 miles in two stages. A track runs on the left bank of the Shatt-al-'Arab to a point opposite Basrah, by keeping on the inland side of the fringe of palms. Two rivers and swampy creeks are crossed. Not suitable for wheeled artillery. No supplies but water plentiful. Two battalions could march in one echelon. 54. Waterways and Seaports. —The important waterways are the Shatt-al-'Arab, the Tigris and the Euphrates. Ocean-going steamers ascend the Shatt-al-'Arab to Basrah, where the tide variation is 6 to 9 feet. There is a bar at the mouth, which has 25 feet at high spring tide, therefore the river is limited to steamers drawing 24 feet. From Basrah to Baghdad the Tigris is navig able for vessels drawing 5 feet in the high season and 3 feet in the low season. Three river steamers of 1,340 tons in all belong ing to the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company39 traverse the 405 miles from Basrah to Baghdad in about 79 hours upstream and 48 hours downstream when not towing br .rges. These 4 barges have a combined tonnage of 520 tons and the combined trip with them takes a fortnight. There are 9 Turkish Company steamers of 4,000 tons in all and 4 barges of 520 tons. These are frequently out of repair and sometimes take 10 to 14 days on the upstream journey. The Euphrates is navigable to a certain extent, but is not generally used for purposes of traffic. Basrah is the seaport of Baghdad. The anchorage for steamers is in mid-stream but two cannot lie abreast. The banks are flat and muddy and cargo is discharged into lighters carrying 15 to 20 tons each, which proceed up the Ashar creek to Basrah where there is a wharf 80 yards long built of brick. Others could be- easily constructed of date logs. 55. Telegraphs. —A cable runs from Bushire to Fao, thence the Turkish Government line connects with Europe via Basrah and Baghdad. Two branches run from Qarneh, one up the Tigris via 'Amarah to Baghdad, and the other up the Euphrates via Hilleh to Baghdad. Thence lines run (1) to Mosul and Constantinople and (2) to Khaniqin and Tehran. 56. The two vilayats of Baghdad and Basrah are directly under {d) Administration. j! 16 Turkish Government at Constan tinople and are m charge of Valis (Lieutenant-Governors). These vilayats are divided into Sanjaqs which are administered by Mutasarrifs (Commissioners). The Sanjaqs are divided into qadhas or kazas and these again into nahiyahs in charge respectively of Kaimmakams and Mudirs. 57. The population is roughly estimated at 1,500,000, about 15 ( p \ Pomiiation ^ S( l uare mile, and consists mainly (e) population. of ^ ^ ^ ^ Syrians, the former either nomad Bedouins or sedentary Arabs ; the greater proportion are Moslems and of these f are Shiahs. The Arab tribes are numerous, the most important being the Muntafik, but they partly reside outside the area. The Arab tribes in Meso potamia are by no means united and inter tribal raids and fights are common. They are generally at variance with the Turks. There are many Jews in Baghdad. 58. Arsenals and factories.—Thzie is an arsenal at Baghdad (/) Resources, and a clothing factory. The rifles and ammunition for the Redif are40 stored here and at other smaller centres. Military stores, ammu nition, etc., are imported by sea and river via Basrah. It would take about 2 months for stores to reach Baghdad from Syria overland. 59. Supplies. —There are considerable quantities of grain i.e., barley, wheat and rice, and also dates exported from this area. The amount depends on the rainfall and if the harvest fails the export is nil. The average annual export of wheat from Baghdad during 1907-09 was 15,000 tons. Livestock, especially sheep, is plentiful. 60. Transport. —There is little or no wheeled transport. Camels can be hired in large quantities, given time, and mules and donkeys can also be obtained in smaller numbers. Large numbers of Arab horses are exported from Basrah and a fair quantity could always be obtained in the area ; 85,000 horses are said to be born annually in Baghdad alone, but this is probably an exaggeration. 61. The lines of foreign trade are shown graphically on the , .j map and it will be seen also from (fir) foreign ra e. Table B that the great bulk is British at present, though German articles are creeping in : of the £2,100,000 of British trade with Baghdad, £1,000,000, goes on to Kirmanshah via Khaniqin and £360,000 to Mosal. The advent of the Baghdad Railway will soon alter these figures greatly. 62. Baghdad (145,000) is far the most important place in the area, both historically as the seat of {h) Political; the import- Caliphate, politically as the resi- ance of certain centres, histo- dence of the local Government d SS- Consuls and commercially as the centre of all the trade routes. In a military sense it is important as being the headquarters of the XIII Turkish Army Corps. It has a garrison of about 2,500 men. The river steamers from Basrah stop here and it is thus a great distributing centre. There is a bridge of boats across the river of 22 pontoons with a 30 foot roadway; 100 large sailing boats carrying from 20 to 100 tons each are available. Basrah (58,000), the seaport of Baghdad, is the next im portant place in the area. There is a British Consulate here, also a small Turkish garrison of about 500 men. Native boats of 30 tons and under are numerous and there are considerable supplies including an average stock of 800 tons of coal. Karbala (65,000) and Hilleh (30,000) are the other principal towns.41 63. Eussian interests in the zone are very small and are chiefly confined to preventing other powerful interests being established which would compete with hers in Persia. British interests are centred in maintaining and increasing their trade in the area and in preventing a naval base being established anywhere on the shores of the Persian Gulf. They have therefore to protect Messrs. Lynch &amp; Cos.' concession and to see that the channels leading to Basrah are properly buoyed and dredged. There is also a domiciled Indian community of some 3,000 souls under British protection and Indian pilgrims visit Karbala every year in Very* large numbers. Germany is concerned in increasing her trade with the advent of the Baghdad Eailway, and she also hopes to use her increasing commercial interests in the area as a political lever in the future. Turkey is anxious to hold her own and keep out foreign influence as much as possible, while she has her own difficulties with the inhabitants of Arabia, especially the Muntafik Arabs over whom her hold is a loose one only. :! Arabian Littoral.^ 64. The Arabian littoral is naturally divided into two geographical , sections ; the first that portion lying (a) &gt;sica ea ures. within . the Persian Gulf from the mouth of the Shatt-al-'Arab to Has Masandam at the apex of the ' Oman peninsula, the second section continuing east and washed by the Arabian Sea as far as Ras-ul-hadd where the coast line bends south-westwards to the Indian Ocean. 65. The former section presents no distinct physical features. The coast line is generally flat and low with reefs and shoals extend ing nearly its whole length. The country near the coast is mostly desert with no marked features, such hills as exist being mere rocky eminences, fijpm the general desert level. No rivers exist in this section, the inhabitants being dependent for water on wells. In the eastern section the nature of the coast changes somewhat, though the general desolate character is still retained. The chief feature of this stretch of country is the mountain range, which starts at the point of the 'Oman peninsula and runs parallel to the coast along the whole section. This range of moun tains, known as the Western and Eastern Hajar, attains a height of some 10,000' at about its centre and runs at varying distances from the coast line; along the east coast of the 'Oman peninsula the hills run down almost to the sea. These hills are generally bare and rugged with little vegetation, but the valleys are fairly S-248 GSB.42 well cultivated, dates being the principal agricultural product. A certain number of small streams run from these mountains into the Arabian Sea. Of these the 'Wadi Samail is the largest and the valley of that name is the main seat of population and the chief highway between the coast and the interior. None of these streams can, however, be dignified by the name of river. 66. The following islands lie along and appertain to the Arabian littoral. Bubiyan, a low-lying and practically uninhabited island 28 miles by 12 at the head of the Gulf. It is claimed by the Shaikh of -Kuwait, but a small military post, which still remains, was estab lished on it by the Turks in 1902.- Bahrain is an important island of some 208 square miles, the largest of a group known as the Bahrain archipelago, which forms the Shaikhdom of Bahrain, The island is better watered than is generally the case in this region and is the centre of the Gulf pearl fisheries. It is also a considerable emporium for trade to and from the mainland. The centre of this trade is at Manamah, a con siderable town at the northern end of the island. The remaining islands along the coast are either uninhabited or of insufficient importance to require description. 67. As in the case of the Persian littoral the heat along the Arabian (h) Climate shore during the summer is very great and would render active military 1 operations impracticable from June to September. The heat at the mouth of the Gulf and along the shore of the Arabian Sea is greater than at the head of the Gulf. The cold season is healthy and pleasant, the temperature falling considerably at night, though except at the head of the Gulf, frost is, unknown. The rainy season is from November to March, though little rain falls, the total averaging from about 3-1' to 5' during the year at most places. The climate of the Hajar mountains is said to be cold and boisterous during the cold weather. Gen erally speaking the climate is conspicuous for its extreme dryness and this lack of humidity makes the heat to some extent more bearable. 68. The Arabian littoral is totally lacking in any made communications. Practically air (cl Communications. intercourse between places on the' coast is carried on by sea. Communication inland is along43 certain caravan routes leading from the coast to the oases of the interior. Little is known of these routes and there is no place of sufficient strategic importance in the interior to necessi tate the discussion of inland routes. From the nature of the country and owing to the lack of water and supplies of any sort, it is im probable that any exist suitable for military operations. Two camel caravan routes crossing the 'Oman peninsula from Sohar to Abu Dhabi and from Shinas to Dibai and Sharjah are of some interest as being the routes used by caravans to transfer arms to the Gulf to evade the blockade on the Batinah Coast. 62. Masqat is connected by submarine cable with Jask, otherwis© no telegraphic communication exists. It is proposed, however, in the general scheme for wireless telegraphy in the Gulf, to erect stations at Kuwait, Bahrain and Zora (Pirate Coast). 70. Seaports. —The following are the principal ports along the Arabian littoral. Roadstead.—The roadstead is within the Kuwait bay, a stretch Kuwait of water some 20 miles by 10 in extreme extent. The entrance to the bay is about 4 miles across and the depth of water averages from 6 to 14 fathoms. Co?-st.—The coast is generally flat except on the north side of the bay, where a low range of hills from 150' to 400' in height runs parallel to the shore. Landing places for troops.—The water is shoal for 8 fathoms off the town of Kuwait and owing to mud flats landing would be difficult at low tide in any portion of the bay. Landing facilities.—A large number of fishing and pearling boats are obtainable, and in front of the town there are several tidal boat harbours formed of piers and breakwaters, which could be used at high tide. No other facilities exist. Drinking water.—From wells 4 miles to the south of the town, of fair quality. Camping grounds.—The country surrounding the town is pure desert. The usual camping ground used by Bedouins is to the south of the town. Supplies.—Nothing is grown near Kuwait nearly all food stuffs bSing imported, mostly by sea,44 Manamah. The port of the Bahrain archipelago. Roadstead.—Vessels of 19' draught lie 4 miles from the town, but smaller vessels can approach to within 2 miles. Landing facilities.—There are no landing facilities. The bottom shelves very gradually and boats at low water cannot get within J of a mile of the beach. Cargo is usually discharged from boats on to donkeys, which have been trained to work in the sea. Drinking Water of good quality is scarce and is sold in the town at 1 pice a goatskin, being brought in on camels, from some distance, inland. D5hah, formerly known as El Bida'a, is the chief port of the Doliah, Qatar peninsula. It is at present . 1 , occupied by a Turkish garrison of about a hundred men. Roadstead. In a bay some 3 miles in extent, the entrance is 1 mile wide with 15 feet of water. The soundings in the bav vary from 3 to 5 fathoms. * Coast.—The coast is generally flat and low-lying. Landing facilities.—A considerable number of fishing and other boats exist. No other facilities, but landing from boats could be undertaken at any point in the bay. Drinking water.- There is only one well in the town, most of the water coming from some good wells 3 to 4 miles inland. Masqat is the capital of the Oman Sultanate, and the most Masqat and Matrah. important town along the coast of the Arabian Sea. Matrah is another port situated about 2 miles to the westwards. Roadstead. At Masqat in 5 fathoms 600 yards from the shore, exposed to the north and north-west wind. At Matrah the roadstead is similar but is sheltered from all but north-east winds. Landing facilities.—50 yards of wharf available at Masqat at high tide and some 100 yards of beach. At Matrah about half a mile of beach. Numerous fishing and other boats, but no other facilities. Coast.—The coast is generally rocky, the hills coming down close to the sea all round the towns of Masqat and Matrah,45 Defences.—Masqat is defended by the two forts of Jalali and Miran. Neither fort has any modern value. A similar fort ex ists at Matrah. Both towns are enclosed by a wall on the land side^ The garrison consists of some 200 Askarls at Masqat and 100 at Matrah maintained by the Sultan. 71. Administration such as exists along the Arabian littoral W Administration. is 1 mainl &gt;' f ^ 'j™ 18 t of in^Pendent rulers and tribal chiefs, who exercise a nominal control over the various tribes inhabiting the coast region and its immediate hinterland. Such control is usually of a loose order and in most cases does not extend far beyond the neighbourhood of the headquarters of any particular chief. In land and along the less inhabited sections of the coast, civil admin istration is practically non-existent. 72. Beginning at the head of the Gulf, the Shaikh of Kuwait, though nominally under Turkish suzerainty, is an autocratic and practically independent ruler. He claims dominion from the mouth of the Khur Zubair as far south as Ras-al-Ghar. In the immediate vicinity of Kuwait he maintains good order, but his authority is less in outlying portions of his territory. At present he is entirely friendly to the British, to whom he boks for protection against Turkish inroads on his territory. The next section is the Turkish province of El Hasa, which is ad ministered by a Mutasarrif under the Vali of Basrah. The headquar ters of this province is at Hofuf, where the Turks maintain a garrison. Its south-eastern limits are generally recognised as extending about to the south-west corner of the Qatar peninsula, though the Turks claim dominion over the peninsula itself and maintain a garrison at Dohah (El Bida'a), the chief town on the coast of the peninsula. The Shaikh of Bahrain rules all the islands of the archipelago of that name. Though independent in name, this chief is virtually under British protection. The section of the coast from the Qatar to the 'Oman peninsula and including the western coast of the latter is under the nominal control of the various Trucial Chiefs, of whom perhaps the Shaikhs of Abu Dhabi and Sharjah are the most important. Constituted authority may be said to be non-existent in this section. The northern portion of the 'Oman peninsula and the coast from about Ghallah to the Indian Ocean is included in the dominions of the Sultan of Oman or Masqat, as he is perhaps better known.46 „ rpjjg gultan is an independent and autocratic ruler, who, like the Shaikh of Kuwait, keeps good order in and around his capital, Masqat, but whose authority is only nominal at a distance. He is at present entirely friendly to the British and has been induced to co operate in attempting to stamp out the traffic in arms across the Gulf. It must be understood that, except perhaps in the case of the boundary between Kuwait and the Turkish province of Basrah, the limits of the sections given above are indeterminate, no frontiers in the proper sense of the word having ever been arrived at. The limits inland of the various districts are still more vague as they merge in the territories of the Arab tribes of the interior, 73 No reliable estimate can be given of the total population of the Arabian coast littoral. The popula- (e) Population. ^ion may roughly be divided into two Bections. (a) Sedentary population, that of the coast towns mostly engaged in fishing, pearling and mercantile pursuits, and the inhabitants of the oases in the interior engaged in agriculture. (b) The nomad Arabs from the interior. The former section is of very mixed nationalities including hall caste Arabs, Persians, Negroes and, in the eastern section, a large number of Baluchis. The townspeople may be generally con- sidered as of little fighting value. The true Arab on the other hand is probably, as in other parts o£ the world, a good fighting man. The Arab tribes are now well supplied with arms and am munition. 74 The following figures give the estimated population of the principal sections of the country. Kuwait principality—sedentary population 37 ; 000 of whom no less than 35,000 belong to the town and its immediate vicinity; nomad population 13,000. El Hasa is said to have a settled population of 101,000 of whom 67,000 inhabit the Hofuf oasis. The nomadic population of this area is put at 57,000. The principality of Bahrain is said to have a population of 100 000 practically all settled in towns and villages, the number of nomada visiting these islands being inconsiderable.47 In the 'Oman principality the settled population is given as 470,000 and the nomadic as 30,000. An estimate of the numbers of fighting men and armament of each section is given in Table F. 75. Supplies. —The resources in food stuffs of the Arabian lit- , p toral are very small and as regards any esources. surplus available for troops engaged on military operations entirely negligible. Dates are the chief agricultural product and date palms are extensively cultivated, wherever conditions admit. Wheat and barley are also grown to a very limited extent in some areas. Fuel and fodder are very scarce in most districts. The most fertile portion of the coast is along the northern slopes of the Hajar mountains, in the valleys of which wheat, barley, maize, millet and bajra are grown as well as small quantities of lucerne, sugarcane, tobacco and indigo, Generally speaking all food stuffs for troops would have to be imported from oversea. 76. Transport. —The transport animal of the country is the camel, and owing to the scarcity of water and lack of fodder, any force operating inland from the coast would have to depend entirely on camel transport. No reliable statistics are available, but it ia^ probable that large numbers exist. As, however, these are prin cipally owned by the Arab tribes of the interior it is improbable that many would be obtainable, if required for operations in this region. There are also a large number of donkeys in the country. These are extensively used at the seaport towns. A few horses are bred in the interior, but owing to lack of fodder are seldom seen in the coast regions. 77. Foreign trade with the Arabian littoral is mostly in British ^ , hands. Its volume and extent is shown (c) Foreign Trade. graphically in the map dealing with the subject. In addition to the foreign trade depicted on the map there is considerable traffic carried in native dhows from port to port and with the ports of the Persian littoral. The principal imports are cotton goods, food stuffs and arms, and a considerable number of slaughter cattle are also imported from Persia. The ex ports mainly consist of pearls and dates. The chief centres of over sea trade are Kuwait, Bahrain and Masqat. By far the greater proportion of the trade of the last two places is with India, which also participates to the extent of one-third in the trade of Kuwait. The trade in arms along the Arabian littoral is dealt with separately, as a political feature of considerably importance.48 78. The chief centres of population along the Arabian littoral . are Kuwait (35,000), Manamah tance of certain centres ^'his- (25,000), Dohah (12,000), Masqat torical, political, and foreign (10,000) and Matrah (12,000). These interests. have already been alluded to in paragraph 70. The only place of any importance in the hinter land is Hofuf (25,000), which is the principal town of the Turkish province of El Hasa and situated in the fertile oasis of that name. A garrison of Turkish troops is maintained and it is the centre of Turkish influence in the interior. 79. Foreign interests are not great in the Arabian littoral, as previously mentioned, the bulk of the oversea trade is in British- Indian hands and, of the remainder, the greater portion is with Basrah and Persia. Politically also British interests are predominant. During the last century British war vessels cons tantly patrolled the Gulf, suppressed piracy and were gene rally responsible for maintaining order on the sea and along the coast. Various agreements have been made with the independent chiefs from time to time in pursuance of the policy of keeping order and maintaining the status quo. Of other foreign interests, that of Turkey, which is based on the vague aspiration to dominion over the whole of Arabia, is the most important. The political significance of Turkish ambitions is further discussed in Part II. The only other foreign interest of any moment is that of the French in the arms traffic with Masqat, which is alluded to under the heading of arms traffic. Arms traffic. 80 The question of contraband trade in arms and ammunition in the Persian Gulf is one that has, of late years, become of considerable local interest in the region in question. 81 A trade in rifles discarded by European Armies has existed in the Persian Gulf since 1884, and in 1897 the Persian Government entered into an agreement with the British Government by which the ships of the latter were empowered to search ships in Per sian waters and to confiscate contraband cargoes. This action drove the trade to Masqat, which became the main emporium of arms in the Gulf and from which consignments were trans ported in native craft to the Persian and Baluchistan coasts. 82. It was not long before the growing supply attracted the attention of the Afghans and Pathans inhabiting the North-West Frontier districts of India, and a regular traffic in arms was estab lished between the coast and these regions. Naturally the increase49 to arms of precision in possession of these frontier tribes attracted the attention of the Government of India, and in 1907-08-09 attempts were made by the naval authorities to stop the traffic along the Makran coast, but with little success. In 1910 more stringent measures were adopted and a small military force em barked on a R. I. M. vessel and raided arms depots on the Makran andBiaban coasts. The telegraph station guards were also in creased and systematic measures undertaken to prevent the trade. Similar measures on a somewhat larger scale were carried out in the spring of 1911 and since that date the naval blockade of the Gulf has not been relaxed. The result has been to cause consider able loss to the arms traders, but though the traffic to the Balu chistan and MV.kran coasts has been to a great extent stopped, small consignments are still run, the owners jettisoning arms on sight of a man-of-war or armed launch. The trade has been also diverted further up the Gulf, arms and ammunition being carried overland to points on the Arabian Coast west of the'Oman peninsula, and thence shipped to the Persian Coast. This, owing to the greater length of coast to be watched, considerably increases the difficulty of effective blockade. 83. While the blockade is still enforced, we have lately made an attempt to check the traffic at its source at the distributing centre i.e., Masqat. Under arrangements entered into with the Sultan, all arms imported into his dominions are to be stored in a bonded ware house and only issued to approved purchasers. It is hoped that these measures will stop the illicit traffic, as there is no other free port in the Gulf at which European traders can land their arms. Some difficulty is, however, being experienced owing to French treaty rights in Masqat and the question of the validity of the Sultan's action is now the subject of negociations between London and Paris. 84. To show the extent of the traffic, it is estimated that the number of arms imported into Afghanistan via Southern Persia rose from 200 in 1900 to 40,000 in 1908 and fell to 27,000 in 1911, as a result of the blockade ; the total number from 1900 to 1912 run ning to nearly 200,000, of which probably one-third have reached thelxands of the frontier Pathans. In addition, the Afghan tribes have been also largely supplied with arms from the same source, a fact which militates against the power of the central Government to keep order and is consequently inimical to our interests. The general arming of the tribes in South Persia is also one of the chief causes of the present state of lawlessness in that country; the power, not only of the tribes, but also of the individual 248GSB50 possessed of a good weapon with a supply of ammunition, having led to a general disregard for constituted authority and the . prosecu tion of p, series of raids and quarrels with the attendant disturb ance of trade and prosperity. It will be seen that, in every way, the continuance of the traffic is injurious to British interests, while the influx of arms of precision into the districts bordering the North-West Frontier of India constitutes a serious menace to the peace of the border. 85. During the past 4 years 74 lakhs have been spent by the Indian Government on blockade and preventive measures, but with only partial success. It is hoped that the Masqat arrangement may go far to stop the traffic and there are indications that ship ments from Europe are decreasing in consequence of its provisions. Should it not do so, it is probable that even more drastic measures will be forced on the Indian Government as a continuance of the traffic must result in time in every ruffian west of our border being armed with a magazine ride and a plentiful supply of ammunition, a state of affairs which can only mean continual trouble and unrest in the territories in question. Possible Naval Stations. 86. The shores of the Persian Gulf and Arabian Sea are sin gularly destitute of natural harbours which would serve as possible naval stations or bases, such commercial ports as now exist being more or less open roadsteads in which ships of any size have to lie some distance from the shore, with relatively inadequete shelter. 87. It is evident, that for strategical reasons any naval base in these waters should be so placed as to give command over the narrow entrance to the Gulf and also to allow ready egress to the open sea. 88. At the head of the Gulf the natural harbour of Khur Musa might serve as a naval base, but its position is unsuitable strate gically owing to the possibility of access from it to the open sea being barred by an enemy holding the Straits of Hormuz. 89. Two splendid natural harbours, the Elphinstone and Mal colm inlets, exist near the point of the 'Oman peninsula. The cli mate of these harbours is, however, reported as insupportable during the summer months, and their situation is hardly close enough to the straits to satisfy strategical requirements. The smaller harbour of Khur Quwai near the extreme point of the penin sula is more suitably placed, enjoys a somewhat better climate and is generally considered suitable as a naval coaling station.51 90. The best anchorage in Gulf waters is in the Clarence Strait west of Bandar 'Abbas and between Qishm island and the mainland. This anchorage is sheltered from all winds and is ex tensive enough to accommodate a large number of ships. To secure it, however, it would be necessary to occupy the islands of Hormuz, Larak and Qishm, and further there is no natural harbour suitable for a coaling station among these islands. If, however, the harbour of Khur Quwai on the opposite shore of the straits were also occupied as a coaling station, the position thus secured would be a strong and satisfactory one from which to control Gulf waters. « 51—5253 PAKT II. Strategical Conditions. Policy. 1. Owing to the somewhat unusual circumstances of the case policy, as affecting strategical conditions in Persia, may more con veniently be discussed in the light of the political aspirations of her powerful neighbours, than in relation to the desires of the Per sian Grovernment and people, whose present impotence renders it unlikely that they will be able materially to influence the course of events in the near future. The question of policy may thus be discussed under the follow ing headings- (а) Russian policy. (б) British policy including the interests of India (c) Turkish policy. (d) Persian policy. (e) Other factors which may affect the future, e. g., German influence, the interests of other nations and the effect in Afghanistan of a change in the existing regime 2. It is somewhat difficult to sum up impartially the policy (a) The policy of Russia. To^loZo^n eSpeClall f. a . rival Power. , , ., 10 do 60 ' in an y particular case, we have for guidance t — (i) The historic^record of the policy of the Power in question; (») The declared policy aa shown by the treaty en»a!»e ments, as far as made public, and the recent declara- tions of responsible'statesmen. (m) The significance of current events and recent action as evidence in support or otherwise of the dechr P ,l policy as outlined in (n) above. 3. The historical record of Russia in Asia during the nast inn years is one of steady and continued expansion and algrandisemenf at the expense of semi-ciyilized nationalities, but as has frequenttv been urged by Russian statesmen, such expansion is the naturl? result of the existence of semi-savage and ill-controlled states on the border of a civilized power; and in view of our own «W™*- of the Indian Empire, it is difficult for us to fides of such a declaration. The fact remains, however tW Russian expansion has been consistent, and has never in the been brought to a halt except in the face of force majeure-Zd there are indications to show that when thwarted in one d4c tion, the tendency of her policy has always been to seek a line of54 less resistance for further adventure. It is unnecessary for the purposes of this work to trace the course of Russian expansion in Asia and her relations with Persia from the treaty of Gulistan in 1813 to the present day, but the significance of recent events will be touched on later. 4. The declared policy of Russia in regard to Persia may be summarized in the words of the preamble to the Anglo-Russian Convention;—' The Governments of Great Britain and Russia having mutually engaged to respect the integrity and independence of Persia, and being animated by a sincere desire for the preserva tion of order throughout the Persian Empire, and for the peaceful development of that country as well as for the permanent establish ment of equal advantages for the trade and industry of all nations ' The significance of this Convention will be further discussed in relation to British policy, and although it may be argued that Russian actions have hardly been m accord with the pacific aspirations therein expounded, all the public utterances of responsible statesmen have reiterated the desire to abide by the provisions of the Convention. Further, in response to British representations, repeated assurances have been made from time to time to the effect that Russia has no intention of going back on her engagements. Indeed, as the effect of such repre sentations, Russia has from time to time decreased or withdrawn troops from Persian territory. 5. The above may thus be accepted as the publicly declared policy of Russia with regard to Persia, and we may now examine, from a study of recent events, how far her actions appear to be m accord with this policy. As regards her recent action in north Persia, it is significant that since the date of the Anglo -Russian Convention affairs in Persia have gone from bad to worse, and the following is a brief summary of Russian relations with the Persian Government during the past few years. In January 1906 Shah Muzaffar-ud-din, yielding to popular clamour gave his consent to the establishment of a national parlia ment or Mailis. His son, Muhammad'All, who succeeded him in 1907 dissolved and abolished the Majlis in 1908. The constitu tional party then rose in revolt and, with the help of the Bakhtiari, forced Muhammad 'Ali to abdicate in July 1909 A Regent was appointed, but the governing power passed nominally into the hands of the Majlis, but in reality all executive power is vested m the Cabinet In 1911 ex:-Shah Muhammad All landed at Gumish Tappah from a Russian steamer, collected a following and moved on Tehran. After some fighting he was defeated and fled to Russia*56 6. There is thus reason to believe that, in spite of protestations to the contrary, Russia has made but little effort to assist t e powers that be in Persia to establish a stable government, ihe principal evidence in support of this view is the return of the ex- Shah from Russian territory in 1911, a proceeding that cou d easily have been prevented, had she so desired. The dismissal of Mr Shuster at Russia's demand is a further instance ; for, though possiblv lacking in diplomatic tact, there is every reason to suppose that he was working honestly and with some prospect of success to restore the financial equilibrium of Persia vvhich is m itself the first step in the direction of national stability. Russian action is therefore open to the imputation, that his work m this respect was regarded as inimical to Russian interests, irrespective of the benefits it might confer on Persia, and for this reason his dismissal was sought and obtained. The Potsdam agreement with Germany concluded in 1911, relative to railway construction in what is known as the neutral zone, though not contravening the Anglo- Russian Convention, caused considerable dissatisfaction in England as hardly in accord with the spirit of the entente between the two nations. 7. As regards Russian policy for railway construction in Persia fho proposal for a Trans -Persian Railway was originally put forward in 1901 by the Russian Government as a result of the travels and investigations of Captain Rittich of the Russian General Staff The strategical project was dropped owing to tne Russo-Japanese war but has now been revived at the instance of a commercial 'Consortium ' in St. Petersburg. This project is viewed by many as an insidious attempt to take advantage of the present Anglo- Russian entente to bridge the gulf at present existing between the Russian and Indian frontiers. Without going thus fax it is m ( possible that the Russian military authorities are not fully aware of the strategical advantages that will accrue to Russia on the completion of the project, nor is it possible to believe tnat it was put forward without their knowledge and advice as to its military nsnects. We get a light on Russian policy as regards other rail- wav proiects from the provisions of the Potsdam agreement, m which it is stated that Russia intends to construct a system of railways in North Persia and among these a line linking up the Baghd ^Khaniqin Railway with Tehran. Though we are m pos- fiion of no details as to her intentions,, we may confidently anticipate that, if for any reason the project for the Trans-Persian Railway falls through, Russia will at once embark on the cons truction of such lines within her zone, and possibly m the neutral/'-v. 33 57 zone, as she may consider her requirements, commercial and strategical, demand. 8. To sum up, though as shown above, the declared policy of Russia is to observe the integrity and to promote the peaceful de velopment of Persia, we have the following arguments pointing to the possibility of a future change in that policy, followed by the acquisition of some portion of Persian territory:—• {i) That it is not in accordance with historical precedent for Kussia to impose voluntarily an arbitrary limit to the expansion of her frontiers and interests, except under the pressure of superior force which was absent at the time of the signing of the Convention. (ii) That the actions of Russia in North Persia hardly accord with the intentions expressed in the Convention, and that from present indications it appears that Russian diplomacy would be better served by the presence of a puppet Shah, dependent on her good offices, than by the existence of a strong and independent govern ment, constitutional or otherwise, at Tehran. {Hi) That the Convention, if adhered to, debars Russia from what has long been considered her traditional policy 1 , i .e. the acquisition of a port on the Persian Gulf. The voluntary abandonment of this policy was made a cause of great criticism in certain Russian circles at the time of signing of the Convention. On the other hand we must remember that the Convention is not only a local agreement regarding Persia, but has an important bearing on European politics; and further whatever may have happened in Persia, Russia has so far loyally observed its provisions as regards Afghanistan and Tibet. Moreover, the present state of anarchy in Persia cannot be allowed to last indefinitely and the march of events may render Russian occupation of North Persia, either by annexation or under the guise of protection, inevitable in the near future and an event against which we shall no longer be able to protest. The annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina by Austria affords a precedent for the disregard of international instruments of this nature; and whether as the result of deliberate policy, or by the force of circumstances, we must face the probability of Northern Persia coming more or less directly under the control of Russia during the next few years, if indeed it is not formally incorporated in the Russian Empire. S248GSB■58 9. Before discussing British policy in Persia, we may first con- t &gt; -i- u « i- sidor the relation which that country (b) British Policy. ^ to the Emp . re as her geographical position, commercial possibilities and political circumstances. 10. Her geographical position, lying as it does on the easiest and most direct route from Europe to India, must always cause us to view with concern any change in the political status of the country. Up to date the undeveloped and the inhospitable nature of the territories which border on our Indian Empire have rendered it as insular from the view of external aggression as the Channel does the British Isles ; and any attempt to bridge the deserts and mountain ranges extending between the Indian frontiers and the great military powers of Europe must profoundly affect our position as regards the defence of our Indian possessions. 11. Commercially the trade of Southern Persia has until quite recent years been almost entirely in British hands. This trade is not, from its value and volume of great importance, and it is hard to judge of the commercial possibilities of the country if developed. Still, under the stress of modem commercial competition, we can not allow the trade, existing and prospective, of South Persia to fall altogether into other hands, even if we have to face the necessity of sharing it with other nations. 12. As regards the internal politics of the country we have to consider the effect of its dissolution on our Muhammadan subjects in India and in other parts of the world. Owing to the religious differences between Sunni and Shiah this would not be of vital im portance, but as the Pan-Islamic feeling is somewhat to the fore at the present, it is possible that the dismemberment of the Persian Empire might be made the excuse for Muhammadan outbreaks in certain places. It is also probable that the sympathy of a certain school of English politicians with the representative form of Government, which the Persians have so ineffectually endeavoured to set up, may influence our policy with regard to that country to some extent. 13. From the above considerations, it is obvious that we have much to lose and but little to gain by any change in the ' status quo ' in Persia. From all points of view, it is to our advantage to maintain Persia in the same condition as she has been for the past hundred years; independent, but innocuous for aggression. At the same time it has never been, nor is it now, except under the59 pressure of unavoidable circumstances, any part of British policy to acquire or administer a portion of Persian territory. 14. Since 1907, British relations with Persia have been governed by the Anglo-Russian Convention, the main intention of which has been given in discussing Russian policy. The signing of this Convention, though marking a new era in Anglo-Persian relations, did not signify any change in the principles of the 'British policy towards Persia. On the other hand, it was hoped that the Convention would be the means of securing the independence of the country for a considerable period of years, and it was recog nised at the same time that this, to us desirable consummation, could only be realised by coming to an agreement with Russia on the subject. 15. The history of recent relations between Great Britain and Persia may be summed up as a continued effort to bolster up the integrity of the country. Since the above Convention has been in force repeated representations have been made to Russia on behalf of Persia and these have met with a certain amount of success as far as inducing the latter to withdraw her troops. In Southern Persia, where we are more nearly concerned, lawlessness has been rife during the past five years, and in 1911, fears for the safety of the consulates at Shlraz and Kirman brought about a pro posal to send two cavalry regiments to Persia to safeguard the consulates and afford protection to caravans of British goods. Eventually only one regiment was sent to be distributed from Bii shire to Isfahan. A detachment of this regiment was attacked near Kazariin in December 1911, while escorting the British Consul to Shlraz. Reparation and the punishment of the offenders was demanded, but up to date without avail, owing to the powerlessness of the Persian authorities; and the regiment has recently returned to India without a satisfactory settlement of these demands. It would appear therefore that in spite of all our endeavours it may prove difficult to maintain the continued integrity of Persia owing to the state of anarchy into which the internal affairs of the country have fallen during the past few years. Whatever the causes which have led up to this state of affairs, the position is not one that can last indefinitely and we must face the fact that our attitude may have to undergo considerable modifications in the near future. To maintain, by convention or otherwise, the independence of a country which is incapable of governing itself is obviously imprac ticable, and it is possible that British policy may have to aim at securing our interests by means other than by the traditional policy of maintaining the integrity of Persia.60 16, While the above considerationa embody the principles of the British relations with Persia, we are intimately concerned with the question of railway construction in that country. In this connection the Trans-Persian Railway is the most important project at present under discussion. The outlines of the project are given in Part I, and it has been touched on in commenting on Russian policy. Our declared policy in respect to this railway is that, while realising the strategical disadvantages its construction will entail, it would be fu tile to oppose it permanently, should the feasibility of its commer cial success be established; and further, that it is to our advantage to partake in the enterprise while as at present in agreement with Russia, rather than to stand aloof and have nothing to say in the matter, as we have done in the case of the Baghdad Railway. Should we so stand aloof, it is possible that the line, or a considerable por tion of it, might be built without any consideration for our interests, strategical or commercial; thus, as stated by Sir B. Grey, while assenting to the principle of construction and to investigations of its financial possibilities, the Imperial Government has reserved to itself the opinion as to its alignment and gauge in British territory and sphere of influence. As regards other projects, there is an old standing agreement with the Persian Government, to the effect that should Russia construct railways in the north we shall have equal privileges in the south. Under this arrangement several projects have been mooted at different times ; the principal being that of a line from the head of the Gulf to Khurramabad. The object of this line is chiefly commercial, and its construction under British auspices would be a doubtful advantage from a purely strategical point of view. 17, Generally speaking, from a military point of view, as apart from commercial considerations, it is not to our advantage that a single line of railway should be laid in Persia, but owing to the impossibility of permanently opposing all construction, it is considered that we should participate in certain projects for the purpose of rendering them as strategically innocuous and as com- merciallv favourable to our interests as the claims and demands of the various interested parties will admit. 18, Turning to Mesopotamia and the Persian Gulf, we find British policy following the same lines as in regard to Persia, viz. the maintenance of the ' status quo,' the protection of the large British trade interests at Basrah and Baghdad and the exclusion of foreign political interests from Gulf waters. During the past hundred years British interests have been predominant in the Gulf, but, as in the case of Persia proper, signs are not wanting that our position in this respect may be challenged in the futme^' ' 61 Owing to our naval strength, however, we are in a better position to assert our rights in this region than in the interior of Persia. The pronouncement of Lord Lansdowne made in 1903 to the effect that ' we should regard the establishment of a naval base or a fortified port in the Persian Gulf as a grave menace to British interests and we should resist it with all the means at our disposal' is still tho keynote of our policy in this region. 19. The completion of the Baghdad railway and its possible extension to the Persian Gulf is the chief factor to be considered with reference to these regions; and therefore as regards the Gulf as well as Mesopotamia our position is more concerned with Turkey than with Persia, who has no power whatever of making her wishes felt in Gulf waters. The chief significance of the Baghdad Railway is, firstly, the effect its completion may have on our long standing commercial interests at Basrah and Baghdad, and secondly, the increase of power it will afford the Turks in asserting their real or imaginary rights not only in Mesopotamia but all along the Arabian littorals The possible effect of the Balkan War on Turkish Policy in these regions is alluded to in para. 28. 20. For many years the Turks have claimed dominion over the Arabian shore of the Gulf as far as the Oman peninsula, on the score of being the natural successors of the Wahabi Arabs of Najd, who overran 0 ..nd took tribute from this district until the early years of the last century. These claims have never been recognized by Great Britain, but until recent years no particular pains have been taken to contest them, probably owing to the minor interests involved and our obvious power of enforcing our wishes whenever convenient for us to do so. 21. Negotiations have been in progress for some time between the British and Ottoman Governments in regard to various matters and in July 1912 British claims were submitted as follows (i) The Baghdad Railway.—British trade interests in Meso potamia are so important and of such long standing that the customs increase cannot be agreed to without some satisfaction being granted on the subject of the Baghdad Railway. The request for British participa tion in the Baghdad-Basrah section will be withdrawn, provided the following points be agreed to :— {a) Exclusion of differential rates on all railways in Asiatic Turkey. (6) Two British representatives on the Company of the Baghdad-Basrah railway 4 In addition, one Brit-62 ish director on the board of the Baghdad Railway Company. (c) Terminus to be at Basrah. {d) No railway to be continued beyond Basrah, in the direction of the Persian Gulf, without the prior agreement of the British Government. (e) A convention to be signed for the future conservancy of the Shatt-al-Arab. This is the proposed Anglo- Turkish Riverain Commission (details were sub mitted in a separate note). (/) Three additional British steamers to be allowed to navigate between Baghdad and Basrah. ( m ) British and Turkish interests in the Persian Gulf.—In view of the withdrawal of British claims to participation in the Baghdad-Basrah section of the proposed railway the Turks must modify their claims regarding certain localities in the Persian Gulf. It is noted that the Turks renounce their claims on Bahrain. The Turks are reminded that the original and authentic des patches are preserved in the archives of the Foreign Office to the effect that Turkey did not entertain any intention of obtaining supremacy over Bahrain, Masqat, or the independent tribes on the coast of the Persian Gulf. His Britannic Majesty's Government will recognize Turkish sovereignty between the southern limits of Kuwait and Ojair, but are unable to admit any Turkish claims south of Ojairj The Turks must renunciate the Qatar peninsula, including their present post at D5hah (El Bida'a). Regarding Kuwait, the present status quo of the Shaikh's territories must be maintained. The islands of Warbah and Bubiyan must be recognized as Kuwait territory and Turkish posts be withdrawn. His Britannic Majesty's. Government will then recognize Turkish suzerainty over Kuwait and recognize the Shaikh as a Turkish Kaimakam. His Britannia Majesty's Government cannot agree to divide their responsibility for maritime police measures in the Gulf with Turkey. The Turkish Government must recognise the right of Great Britain, which has existed for a century, in the Persian Gulf:— (а) To control surveying, lighting, buoying and pilotage. (б) To police its waters. (c) To conduct all quarantine regulations.63 11 is pointed out that Great Britain is seeking no territorial aggrandisement, nor embarking upon any new developments of policy, but merely seeks an endorsement to the status quo of the past century. (Hi) Increase in the Turkish customs dutiesIf the terms of this memorandum be agreed to, and if the existing veto on the borrowing power of Egypt be removed, His Britannic Majesty's Government will consent to, (a) a renewal of the increased rate of customs duties from 8 to 11 per cent, for a further term of seven years, i.e., from 1914 to 1921, and (6) a further increase from 11 to 15 per cent for the same period. In amplification of this memorandum three supplementary notes were presented. One defined the e xtent of Kuwait territory, the northern boundary passing just south of the points Umm Qasr, Safwan, Jabal Sanam, and thence westwards to the Batma ; the southern boundary leaving the coast at Jabal Manifah and thence pom» inland. Another note gave the proposed terms for the information of the Anglo-Turkish Kiverain Commission for the control of the Shatt-al-'Arab. The third note, with a map, laid down the existing boundaries of 'Arabistan, near Muhammareh, as observed locally for the past 60 years, the preservation of this boundary, vis -a-vis Turkey, being insisted on. . Netfcciations on the above points have recently been renewed and there are indications that they may result in a settlement acceptable to British policy. 22 Another reason for our wishing to prevent the consolidation and extension of Turkish dominions in the Gulf regions is the fear that in the future such interests might be hypothecated to Ger- manv whose influence at Constantinople has been predominant of late years and whose possible advent to the Gulf on completion of the Baghdad Railway we could not regard without serious concern. 23 To sum up ; it may be accepted that the obj ect of our policy is the same to-day as it has been heretofore ; viz., the maintenance of the integrity of Persia and of the status quo in the Persian Gulf, but that such policy is becoming increasingly difficult to support. As regards Persia, in the by no means improbable event of the necessity of a change of policy due to the absolute break down of any form of government, the problem before our statesmen will {i) whether to adhere to the policy of abstention from any acquisition or administration of Persian territory; or,64 (it) to accept the logic of changed circumstances, and, in agreement with other nations concerned, to take over such territory as our strategical and economical in terests may render desirable. Though military considerations, especially the defence of India, will be of the first importance in arriving at a decision between the above courses, it is beyond the scope of this work to attempt to indicate the lines on which the decision should be based. As regards our position in Gulf waters and vzs-a-vis Turkey there is no indication that we intend at present to abandon our tra ditional policy, nor is there any reason why we should not be succes- ful in maintaining it, though it is possible we may have to make some concession to Turkish sentiment, if matters are to be amicably adjusted, when negociations are resumed. Should the Trans-Persian Eailway materialize, however, we shall have to reconsider the question of a port on the Persian shore of the Grulf; the question which will naturally arise being, whether we wish, and are able to ensure, that the port at which the railway first touches the coast is under our control or internationalized. 1 he latter contingency is obviously against our interests as the establishment of any international port in the Gulf would materially alter the ' status quo ' to our disadvantage. 24. Turkish policy towards Persia may be regarded as negative (e) Turkish policy. f' ^ ch f racter - Thou g h m her own interests it is natural that she would view with concern the partition of Persia among European Powers, especially Kussia, there seem no indications to point to the likelihood of her taking active measures to prevent such a consum mation. The sentiment which might have been anticipated on behalf of a neighbouring Muhammadan nation appears non-existent or at any rate has not been prominently manifested up to date. 25. The relations between the two countries of late years have been confined to an apparent desire on the part of Turkey to prey on her weaker neighbour by encroachments along the Turko-Persian frontier. The most important of these encroachments was in the country between Kurdistan and Lake Urumieh. The reason attributed for this encroachment is the desire of the Turks to strengthen their position in Asia vis-a-vis Russia, by occupying the exit between Lake Van and Lake Urumieh. This would have enabled them to threaten the Russian communications through the Caucasus. The import of tfiia move did not, however, escape the notice of the65 Bussians, who at once sent troops into Azarbaijan, and it was thought possible that war between the two countries would result. The Turks, however, appear to have abandoned their designs in this region. Further south, minor encroachments have taken place, and a Turkish claim to part of the dominions of the Shaikh of Muhammerah is at present the subject of negociations between the Turkish Government and ourselves, the Shaikh having for some time been regarded as under British protection. 26. Turkish policy and pretensions in the Persian Gulf have already been alluded to in discussing British policy. As was mentioned in that connection Turkish policy has for some time been under the suspicion of being dictated from Berlin, and for this reason it assumes more importance than would be otherwise attached to it. 27. We may sum up to the effect, that, though the annexation of Persian territory by an European Power being made an excuse for a Pan-Islamic movement headed by Turkey is perhaps a possible, though improbable, contingency, it is much more likely that Turkish action will be confined to more modest efforts at sharing in the spoil, or in acting at the instigation of Germany in furthering the latter's aims and interests. It is also probable that her action in regard to the Gulf is rather dictated by amour propre and possibly at German instigation, than by a definite policy of further ing any substantial interests in that region. 28. Pending a definite settlement of Balkan affairs and some knowledge of the power of recuperation the Turkish Empire may develop, it is hard to speculate on the effect of the war on Turkish politics in the region under discussion. Given a stable Government and freedom from outside interference, the relief from European responsibilities may result in increased development and consolida tion of power in her Asiatic possessions; on the other hand the popu lation of Asia Minor and Arabia is by no means homogeneous.; for this reason and owing to lack of money the task before Turkey will be a difficult one and it is safe to assume that she will be power- - less materially to influence matters in Persia or on the Gulf for some years to come, especially if opposed by Great Britain or Russia. 29. As previously stated, the policy of Persia can, to a (d) Persian ooliey g 16 ®* 1 extent ' be dii » r eg!w&lt;M from ' the point of view of strategical considera tions, and as far as its power of materially influencing the course of events is concerned. Generally speaking, the country is in a chaotic state and the nominal rulers have neither the authority to formulate nor the power to enforce any particular policy. S248GSB66 30. Tehran, the seat of government, being in the north and within the Russian sphere of influence, Russian counsels have been predominant for many years ; and, in consequence, in spite of any endeavours the Persian people may make or of any assistance that may be afforded to them by other nations, it seems likely that the future of the country is largely dependent on the good offices of her^ northern neighbour. There is no doubt that the Anglo-Russian Convention has caused much resentment in Government circles foreshadowing, as it does, that the contracting Powers have earmark ed certain portions of Persian territory for annexation when and if opportunity offers. British influence has, however, always been overshadowed by that of Russia in North Persia, and recent events have tended considerably to lower our prestige in districts in South Persia, where at one time it was paramount. 31. The most powerful faction at present is that of the Bakhtiari, largely due to the fighting qualities of the tribes of that clan; and there is reason to believe that they fully appreciate the menace to their independence which Russian projects and encroachments offer, and also the possibility of British assistance to prevent the absorption of Persian territory. The power of the Bakhtiari is, however, the cause of much jealousy in certain quarters, especially with the better educated Persians of the capital. The Bakhtiari are also on bad terms with the Arabs in the south, and recently an open rupture between them and the Shaikh of Muhammerah was narrowly averted by the mediation of the British consular officers. Though defeated in his late invasion of Persian territory, the ez-Shah has still a considerable following in the country, and there is reason to believe that this faction has the countenance, if not the active support, of Russian agents. 32. Persian policy may thus be summed up as a laudable en deavour to maintain the integrity of the country and incidentally to keep the governing power in the hands of what is, for the time, the most powerful faction. It is also probably recognised that, under existing circumstances, the only means of doing this is to play off against one another the various Powers with existing or potential interests in the country. It may be added that owing to inter nal discord, jealousies and intrigues as also to the lack of governing power and administrative ability, the power of the Persian Gov ernment even in this latter respect is not great. 33. Of other nations, who have interests in Persia, Germany is the most important. Her interests are, Policy of other countries. ag s ^ a ^ e( j j n ^ Potsdam agreement, at present purely commercial and of quite recent date. Apart67 from her rapidly expanding seaborne trade, they arise from her desire to acquire some of the trade of Persia for the Baghdad Railway, by means of feeder lines in Central Persia. At present Germany has no power, except through Turkey, of actively influenc ing events in Persia or in the Gulf, nor is it probable that she will be able so to do for many years to come; yet at the same time, in the light of the Agadir incident we may read her determination to have a say in the disposal of ' unallotted or undeveloped' territories in any region, if not by actual participation then by exerting pressure to obtain compensation elsewhere. Her interests in the Baghdad Railway and the recent recognition of her commercial interests in Persia by Russia are a sure sign that she intends to be consulted in the future status of Persia should any changes of moment appear probable. 34. Afghanistan, as a neighbouring Musalman state, can hard ly but regard with concern the prospect of wholesale changes in the political status of Persia, especially if such changes result in European domination of the country. The cleavage between Shiah and Sunni, however, prevents any great sympathy between the two countries, and further, the imitation of western methods of government in Persia has in all probability aroused the resent ment of the Amir, as the resulting anarchy has given rise to his derision. Indeed it has been recently reported that, in answer to a mission asking for the good offices of Afghanistan towards Persia in her troubles, he replied curtly to the effect that the Persian people had only themselves to thank, and that it was no concern of his. In any case the Afghans have not the power of intervening directly in Persia, though whether for Pan-Islamic or other reasons should they choose to do so they could, by action on the North-West Frontier, seriously hamper British action in Persia as regards the power of utilising the Army in India for operations in that country. 35. Except in minor trade matters, such as the French traffic in arms with Masqat which is alluded to in Part I, no other nations have interests in Persia or in the Gulf of sufficient moment to require discussion. 36. The above is a brief outline of the aims and policy of the various Powers with interests in Persia. Owing to her military weakness, she is wholly at the mercy of her neighbours, and the continuance of her present state of nominal independence is entirely dependent on the maintenance of the Anglo-Russian Convention. The measure of this independence may be judged by the fact, that at the present time negociations regarding the construction, align ment, gauge and other details of the Trans-Persian Railway are in68 active progress, while, as openly admitted, the Persian Government has not been consulted in any particular, even as to whether it is willing to assent to the principle of such a railway. Possibly the chief danger of the rupture of the Anglo-Russian Convention, as regards Persia, is its weakness in thus affirming an independence which is practically non-existent. Armed Forces. (a) The Russian Army and its power of concentration on the Persian frontier. 37. The Russian Army has been dealt with in great detail in Chapter I, Part II, ' A study of the The Russian Army. existing strategical conditions of the North-West Frontier of India, 1912,' and it is not proposed to re produce this here. The general results will be given and those portions only of that army, likely to be used in Persia, will be dis cussed in fuller detail. 38. The peace strength of the Russian war forces is estimated at 1 ,390,000, of whom 42,000 are serving in the fleet, 54,000 in frontier guards, leaving 1,294,000 in the standing army. The war strength of the Russian army is about 5,000,000 men in 37 army corps, 2 independent rifle brigades and 28 cavalry divisions, fortress and local troops, giving a field army of about 2,750,000 men. The rank and file are possessed of high military qualities, but the orga nization and training of the staff and higher leaders is not so good. For purposes of comparison the value of the Russian army may be taken as equal to that of a mixed British and Indian force from India. 39. Tables C and D in the Appendices give the composition and distribution of the Russian army and data regarding higher units. The portions chiefly affecting Persia are summarised below ;— Army Corps. Head Quarters. Fighting strength. Rifles. Sabres.

Kussia manufactures practically all her military require ments in government and private factories. She produces every thing necessary, raw material, food stuffs, manufactories and animals for the support of her population and the waging of war by land. There are 29,000,000 horses in the Kussian Empire. 41. The regimental transport in the Russian army consists mainly of 1-horse, 2-wheeled carts, normal load ^th a ton. It is estimated that in Russian Turkistan 200,000 camels and 800,000 horses are suitable for campaigning purposes and that they can be collected at railheads in that country at a rate of not more than 30,000 camels or their equivalent in pack animals per month. A force of all arms on normal Russian (European) establishments requires 176 five-maund animals per 1,000 men to equip it with regimental transport and divisional supply columns. This scale allows for supplies, including those on man and horse, for 9 days for men in artillery, engineers and infantry and for 8 days for cavalry; also oats for horses for 4 days for cavalry and for 1| days for artillery. Its power of concentra- 42. The communications between tion on the Persian Fron- Russia and the Persian frontier con- tier. sist of:— {a) The railway from Tifiis to Julfa. (6) The two railways to Baku on the Caspian Sea from Rostof and Batoum respectively. (c) The Caspian sea flotilla. {d) The Central Asian Railway from Kransnovodsk via Merv to Kushk. (e) The Samara -Tashkent Railway to Merv. The Caspian shipping in 1909 included 822 vessels in all of which 256 were steamers. The tonnage was, steamers 190,346 tons and sailing vessels 114,453 tons. The available shipping can transport troops across the Caspian at least as fast as the Central Asian Railway can deal with them. The capacity of these railways for troop trains may be taken to be from 6 to 9 troop trains per diem each way (S. S., Part II, page 18 para graph 21) for concentration purposes, after allowing a week to 14 days for preliminary preparation. It is probable that from their peace stations the 1st and 2nd Caucasian Corps are destined for Julfa ; the 3rd Caucasian Corps and Cossacks for Baku and thence to Enzali and Astarabad ; the 2nd and 1st Turkistan Corps for Askhabad and stations between there and Kushk. Taking7a somewhat the same line of reasoning as developed in Part II, pages 19 to 20,of the 'Strategical Study of the North-West Frontier of India' it would seem that, allowing mobilization to be proceeding during the 14 days of railway warning, a rough estimate of the time taken for the Russian army including its regimental transport to concentrate on the Persian frontier would be — (1) at Julfa :—1st Caucasian Corps 15th day of concentration or 29th day from date of orders to mobilize; 2nd Caucasian Corps 30th day of concentration or 44th day from date of orders to mobilize; (2) at Enzali and ports on Caspian Sea where required :—3rd Caucasian Corps and Cossacks 20th day of concentra tion or 34th day from date of orders to mobilize; (3) at Askhabad or places on Central Asian Railway east of that place :—- 2nd Turkistan Corps 6th day of concentration or 20th day from date of orders to mobilize ; 1st Turkistan Corps 20th day of concentration oi 34th day from date of orders to mobilize; and that after those dates the Russians could, if necessary, concen trate at each of these three points at the rate of from 75,000 to 90,000 men a month. This rate of concentration is of course much quicker than is likely to be necessary for many years to come. (6) The Turkish Army and its power of concentration on the Persian frontier * 43.

But this is still mostly on paper, and it is doubtful whether in Asia Minor and Mesopatamia more than 50 per cent, of the paper totals would be available as actual strength. 44. The corps which chiefly concern Persia and the Persian Gulf are as follows :— The IX (Erzerum) Army Corps } X (Erzinjan) Army Corps V on the Caucasus Frontier XI (Van) Army Corps .. ) * tfote.—The information in paras. 43-47 was obtained from a reliable source prior to the outbreak of the Balkan War, There is no information yet to hand to show how that war has affected the situation; but the pre sumption is that for the present the available forces are less effective than shown in this work.T1 Consisting of 7 Nizam divisions and 7 Red it divisions forming a total strength on mobilization of about 175,000 men. XII (Musal) Army Corps Y on the Mesopotamia-Persian XIII (Baghdad) Army Corps j Frontier consisting of 4 Nizam divisions and 4 Redif divisions, giving a war strength, on paper, of close on 100,000 men. While in support there is— - The VIII (Damascus) Army Corps consisting of 3 Nizam divisions together with 3 Redif divisions with a total strength of 75,000 men. In addition there are about 11 ' frontier companies each 100 strong for service on the Turko-Persian border. The Arab tribes in Mesopotamia are also powerful, the most important being the Muntafik who can collect 4,000 horseman and a large number of dismounted men, all well armed with rifles. 45. The Turks of Asia Minor are good fighters, especially the infantry, on the defensive. In Mesopotamia the rank and file are mostly Arabs, the remainder being Turks, Kurds and a few Armenians. The officers are nearly all Turks. The infantry are hardy and good natural soldiers, but not well trained. The artillery are not well armed and the cavalry are poorly mounted; neither of these arms is, therefore, very efficient. There are no warlike manufactories in Turkey in Asia, so arms and munitions of war must be obtained from Europe. The transport is very deficient. 46. The war strength on paper of a Nizam Division, under the changes introduced in 1912, is as follows Infantry-^ ' 1 Nishanji battalion .. ) &gt; 10 battalions @ 1,065 = 10,650 3 regiments each of 3 battalions ) rifles. Each battalion comprises 3 companies and 1 cadre company. Each regiment to have 1 machine gun company with 4 machine guns. Artillery— 1 regiment of field artillery (= 3 batteries) = 18 guna.

The Ihtiyat is as yet prac tically non-existent in Mesopotamia, and it is doubtful whether the most strenuous efforts could add more than 50 per cent, of person- n pi f 0 existing actual strengths of the Nizam units.

(c) The Persian Army and the power of the tribes for aggression or defence. 48. The Persian army is best divided The Persian Army. j n t 0 (1) The Cossack Brigade. (2) Regular Infantry. (3) Tribal levies, chiefly cavalry. (4) Artillery or men enlisted as gunners. Of the above (1) includes the only regular cavalry in Persia and its present strength is reported to be as follows : • Cavalry .. .. 841 (4 regiments). Artillery .. .. 160 (2 Batteries, one of 6 Q. F. Creusot field guns the other of 4 old pattern bresch-loaders and 2 Creusot mountain guns). Infantry •• ..813 (One battalion). Total, with headquarters at Tehran 1,869. It is commanded by a Russian officer and has other Russian officers also. The formation of a unit at Tabriz was commenced last July, and so far 345 recruits have been enlisted. S248GSB74 (2) There are supposed to be 78 battalions of regular (unre- formed) infantry drawn as follows [ 25 from Azarbaijan 9 from Mazandaran, 5 from Iraq 5 rom Hamadan, 4 from Kirmanshah, 3 each from Isfahan Kirman and Kazvin and the remaining bat- ahons from various cdd places in Northern Persia none from Southern.

A large number of these tribesmen are now armed with modern breech-loading rifles, though their stores of am munition are necessarily limited to what they can obtain by smuggling from various directions. {d) The Arabian Littoral and 'power of the tribes for offence or defence. 51. The only organised military forces in the districts bordering on the Arabian Littoral are those maintained by the Turks m the El Hasa province. The garrison of this province consists of — 4 battalions of regular infantry. 2 squadrons. 1 battery of light guns drawn by mules. Of these 1 battalion, 2 squadrons and the battery are kept at Hofuf, the remaining 3 battalions being distributed in small detachments in different parts of the country. Six Buluks or companies of armed gendarmerie are also maintained, of which four are mounted. The regular troops are relieved every two years from Basrah, and all units are believed to be much under their authorized strength. 52. As regards armed forces maintained by the various chiefs, the Shaikh of Kuwait maintains a personal body-guard of 100 armed men. The Shaikh of Bahrain has a force of some 540 armed men for personal and police duties in his dominions. The Sultan of Masqat maintains a force of 1,050 askari or soldiers; of these 200 are in Masqat and 100 in the neighbouring town of Matrah, the remainder being scattered in small detachments all over his dominions. The Sultan also posseses one 300-ton steam yacht mounting a 9-pr. K. M. L. gun and a five-barrelled Norden- felt of '45 calibre. « 53. The military value of these forces may be said to be practically nil; but, on the other hand, it is probable that these chiefs could count on the assistance of considerable numbers of well-armed tribesmen to resist aggression on their domains. An estimate of the numbers and armament of the various sections is given in Table F. Owing to the difficulty of supply and lack of water on many of the routes, large combinations for continued offensive action are improbable. The part played by the Arabs against the Italians in Tripoli must, however, be borne in mind, and while the effective occupation of one or more of the coast towns would possibly be easy of achievement, any operations76 inland would probably meet with strenuous resistance, while in addition the nature of the country would present serious obstacles to success. There is, however, no strategical objective away from the coast of sufficient importance to render such operations probable. ( e ) The Afghan Army and its power for operating in Persia. 54. The military strength of Afghanistan consists of (a) The Regular Army; ( m ) The Irregular Forces; (m) The Tribesmen. The Regular Army numbers roughly— 16,000 sabres in 40 regiments; 62,000 rifles in 96 battalions; 3,000 sappers; 490 mobile guns, of which about 240 are pack. The Irregular Forces are composed of Khasadars or militia; about 32,700 men. Khawanin Sowars; about 7,900. 55. The Tribesmen. History shows that the organised forces represent a part only of the military power of Afghanistan, which has always rested largely on the fighting qualities of the people. The number of unorganised fighting men is difficult to estimate! The experience of past wars, however, seems to indicate that it is unlikely that more than 20,000 tribesmen will be met in any one engagement in the open field; though, if encouraged by the enemy's defeat or inaction, these numbers would increase rapidly. 56. Of the above forces the greater proportion are concentrated in the Kabul district, and it is in this district also that the more formidable fighting tribes are to be found, the inhabitants of the Herat district being generally unwarlike. The garrison of the Herat district which borders on the Persian province of Khorasan ia said to consist of;— 1,250 sabres; 7,200 rifles; 51 mobile guns; 4 ,500 irregulars.77 Since the Russian occupation of Meshed it is reported that the garrison of Herat has been strengthened to some extent. The district is, however, dependent on Kabul for supplies of warlike stores, etc., and it is improbable that the Herat garrison is in a condition to undertake effective offensive operations. As regards the possi bility of reinforcements from other parts of Afghanistan, Kandahar is 403 miles from Herat by the direct road via Girishk and Farah. Kabul is 4111 miles by the Daolatyar Maidan-Pai Kotal road, a very difficult route and almost impracticable for large bodies of troops. A few reinforcements might also come from Mazar-i-Sharlf, distant 390 miles from Herat. 57. Judging, however, from recent events, the mobility of the Afghan Army is small, and it is doubtful whether the garrison of the Herat district could be augmented to any great extent, even after lengthy preparations. In view of the absence of any effective military force in Khorasan, it is possible that the Afghans could occupy Meshed and other towns in that province but for the presence of Russian troops. As any such enterprise, however, could easily be dealt with by the Russians from Askhabad, or by a movement from Kushk on Herat itself, the power of Afghanistan for offensive operations in Persia may be regarded as nil. As stated in paragraph 34, therefore, the only power the Afghans have of influencing the political situation in Persia is by creating trouble along the North-'West Frontier of India, and so occupying the attention of a large portion of the armed forces in that country. {/) The British and Indian armies and their 'power of operating in Persia and the Persian Gulf. 57. Warlike operations by Great Britain in Persia may be considered under the following headings:— {i) Operations against the Persian Government or the now semi-independent tribes in the south of Persia for the purpose of protecting British interests and restoring order. . (n) Operations such as might be necessary in the event of the Imperial Government deciding to assume control of and administer some portion of Persian territory. (in) Operations in Persia against one or other of the Powers with interests in that country. In the first two of the above cases, the operations would in all probability fall to the lot of the Army in India which, except in78 the event of serious trouble on the North-West Frontier, would be quite adequate to deal with any situation vis-d-vis Persia or the southern tribes, and also for the occupation of such districts in the south as may possibly come under our control. As regards {Hi), should the maintenance of our interests in Persia cause a rupture with any other European Power, it is possible that operations in Persia will be subsidiary only and that we shall seek to decide the issue elsewhere. On the other hand, it is easy to imagine a situation arising in Persia, on the completion of existing railway projects, which would be far beyond the power of the Army in India to cope with, if indeed it did not necessitate the employment of the whole armed strength of the Empire. 58. In view of the above we may'consider ;— _^ Lj power of the Army in India to operate in Persia. B. The power of Great Britain and the rest of the Empire to develop force in that country should it be decided that the issues at stake demanded a decision there. ^ The power of the Army in India to operate in Persia. 59. The armed strength of India comprised on 1st July 1912:— Regular Army. Reserves. Volunteer Forces. I.S. Troops. Military Police Militia and Levies. British. Indian. 74,641 151,834 34,128 33,511 20,051 32,778 226,475 60. The Civil Police number about 152,000, of whom 74,500 are armed with muskets and smooth-bore breech-loaders. The bulk are located in the United Provinces and Bengal. 61. The armed forces of the Native States number about 130,000 including irregulars. With a few exceptions they possess no rifled arms. Their military value is small. 62. Forces available for the field army.—Of the above forces the following can be drawn on for service with the field armies or on the lines of communication :— (t) The Regular Army ;79 (n) The Imperial Service Troops; {Hi) The Frontier Militias, for local operations onlji The fighting strength available for active operation is approxi mately 21,000 sabres, 96,000 rifles, and 400 guns organised in 9 Divisions and 8 cavalry brigades ; with army and line of communi cation troops. 63. Mobilization.—During the cold weather units detailed for the field army, can be in readiness to march or entrain in 48 hours after orders to mobilize. The dispersion of British units in sani taria and the absence of two-fifths of the Mian troops on and , often at considerable distances from their headquarters, may, however, be expected to retard mobili zation considerably during the summer monthSj 64. Replacement of Wastage.— Men.—Judging from the experience of recent frontier campaigns, the wastage August ^V 5 - per cent - ^ of Army in India for War. arms during a year s campaign under normal conditions in Asia. A wastage of 15 per cent, is anticipated among the troops remaining in India and employed in internal defence. With this wastage in the first year about 39,000 British officers and men and 78,000 native soldiers would be required to main tain the Regular Army alone at its present strength. To meet this demand the following sources are available :— British .. ' .. •. Oversea reinforcements. Native .. .. .. The Indian Army Reserve and recruiting in India. Remounts.—Over 23,000 horses are required for the field army, and about 11,000 for units detailed for in ternal defence. The wastage on these is estimated at about 10,000 in the first year. The total of horses con sidered fit for military purposes in India is only about 14,000 ; so that the resources of India will be unable to stand the strain of a long campaign and remounts must be imported on a large scale from oversea.80 65. Manufacturing Resources.—The following Government factories are devoted to. army work :— i. Dum-Dum ^ y ammunition factories, with an annual war ii. Kirkee J outturn of— S. A. Ammunition .. 75,000,000 of • 303 cartridges. Q. F. 13-pr. .. .. 72,600 rounds. Q. F. 18-pr. .. .. 101,700 rounds. Hi. Ishapore Small Arms factory is designed for an annual output estimated at 25,000 rifles. This figure has, however, not yet been reached. iv. Cossipore Gun Factory—The gun plant has a capacity of about 100 field and mountain guns per annum, but is dependent at present on England for certain com ponents, which are put together and completed in India. v. Ishapore Shell Factory, a branch of {iv), is capable of supplying annually :— 10-pr. B. L. shell .. •. •• 55,800 5' and 6' Howitzer, and 5 B, L. gun shell 40,000 vi. Aruvankadu Cordite Factory is capable of supplying all the requirements of the Army in India as regards cordite cartridges, guncotton, etc. vii. Jubbulpore Gun Carriage Factory is capable of an annual outturn of gun carriages and vehicles to com plete 8 field batteries as well as large numbers of transport carts. viii. The Cawnpore Harness and Saddlery Factory supplies all the requirements of the Army in India in leather goods, accoutrements, saddlery, harness, etc. Indian factories are thus able to supplement the authorised reserves of ammunition (210,000,000 rounds small arms and 456 ,900 gun) by 75,000,000 rounds of small arms ('303), and about 185 000 of field and mountain gun ammunition, during the first twelve months of the hostilities. They are also in a position to meet requirements in accoutrements and harness, gun carriages and ordnance vehicles, and small arms and their components.81 India is, however, practically dependent at present on impor tations for certain field gun components, hospital stores, entrench ing and artificer's tools, telegraph, telephone, and electric light stores, as well as other articles of minor importance. 66. The Transport Eesources of India are estimated at:— Standing transport and registered animals available in two months, Mulea and ambulance riding animals .. .. 50,233 Camels (without Ghilzais) .. .. 42,725 Camela (with Ghilzais) .. .. 60,221 Bullocks .. .. .. .. •. 65,780 In census returns the numbers of transport and other animals in India, excluding standing and registered transport, are given as,:— Camels .. • • • • • • •. 403,975 Mulea 73,666 Horses and ponies .. •• • • .. 1,553,289 Bulls and Bullocks .. .. .. .. 40,464,561 Of the above it is probable that 10 per cent, of useful animals, viz., camels, mules and bullocks, would be found fit for military- services, and could be withdrawn without materially affecting the civil requirements of the country. 67. Under existing circumstances, the Army in India could operate in Persia either {i) by means of an oversea expedition to the shores of Southern Persia, or (ii) by an advance overland to Sistan and the utilization of the resources of that province as a base for subsequent operations. The question of the force that could be spared from India for these operations will be discussed later. 68. {i) An oversea expedition.—The most convenient ports for the embarkation of troops for Persia are Karachi and Bombay, though in an emergency it might be necessary to use Calcutta also owing to the considerable facilities for fitting out ships at that port. All these ports are -connected with the rest of India by one or more broad gauge lines capable of effecting a rapid concentration of S 248 GSB (82 4 troops. The harbour facilities for embarkntion are ample hi each case. The rate of despatch, however, is limited by the rate dt which suitable shipping can be taken up and fitted for use as transports. It is estimated that there are 44 ships suitable to the Indian Ocean belonging to the British India and Asiatic Steam Navigation C6m|)anie's; bapdble bf carrying 28,300 men and 7,500 animals. A definite time, however, cannot be given in which any or all of these ships could arrive at Indian ports and be handed over to the Marine authorities for fitting out. As far as fitting out the ships is con cerned the time of year makes no difference; The time necessary fot the fitting out of ships for the conveyance of troops oversea is six day.; both at Bombay and Calcutta as long as the horse and mule fittings at present in stock hold out; when that stock is finished ten days would be required; Five ships at a time can be fitted oilt at Bombay and seven at Calcutta. At Karachi one steamer at a time can be fitted out and would take a week to complete. But ships fitted out at Bombay coal'd be sent on to Karachi and could embark troops very rapidly at the 16 berths available. In the case of the despatch of troops to South Africa 1 ship a day was despatched on the 5th, 6th and 7th day after orders Were received to take up shipping and an average of 2 ships a day from the 7th day. If the same rate were attained the first troops might arrive at a port on the Persian shore of the Gulf about 15 days from the date of the orders to take Up shipping arid a division with trar .s 'port in from 35 to 40 days. Subsequently troops would arrive at an average rate of 2 shiploads a day or at the rate of 15 to 20 days per division as the time necessary for fitting transports Would be eliminated by utilizing those employed for the leading trOops {see grrj 'hic H). As regards disembarkation Part I, paragraphs 38 and 70, give the facilities at the various ports on the Persian littoral. It will be seen that for landing troops oh any large scale facilities are very limited and would have to be considerably augmented from the resources at our ports. A probable rate of disembarkation including stores would be 1 day for ships carrying dismounted troops and 2 days for shipscaifrying mounted troops and transport, until facilities for disem barkation had been considerably developed. 69. (ii) An advance on Sistan from India would be by thQ trade route from railhead at Nushki via Robat to Nasratabad, 488 miles in 28 stages. Owing to tlje lack of water, this route is suitable only for the march of troops in small detachments and equipped with all camel transport; and for the same reason the passage of cavalry and artillery would present great difficulties. Its capacity is at most one battalion a day and the lack of supplies would render it pecessary to stock large qu; ntitics of supplies before an advance could be undertr.ken. The road has been traversed by a motor car and would not present much physical difficulty to railway construction, but the lack of water would hamper construction, and it is improbable that a rate of more than | mile a day could be attained. The Spezand-Nushki railway has a capacity of 4 trains a day; but as troops destined for &amp; stan would have to march off in detachments thh is not the determining factor in the rate ol concentration in S:stan. Allowing 32 days for the collection of transport and for pre parations Siuch as stocking depots and cleaning out wells along the route, it might be possible to move detachments of about 8Q0 men with camel transport op alternate days along the route. In this way the Reading detachment .might reach Nasratabad in $5 days and a division be concentrated in S'stan in 120 days from date of concentration commencing. (See Appendix Ko. 3.) Owing to the depletion of grazing along the route, which would be occasioned by the movement of such large numbers of camels, it is improbable -that material additions to this force could be made until fodder had been stocked along the route, an almost impracticable operation in large quantities over such a distance. The route from Nushki via the Helmand is shorter by about 100 miles, and when once the Helmand is reached the difficulties as regards water and supplies would be mi ch less. On the section from Nushki to the Helmand (some 150—160 miles) however, these difficulties would be as great p.s on the trade route and the routo lies almost wholly in Afghan territory.84 As regards the maintenance of troops in Sistan, it is estimated that supplies of food, grain and fodder could be obtained for 2 divisions for one year. Departmental stores and other supplies would, however, have to be forwarded along the trade route. On a basis of 15 per cent, of food supplies a division would require some 6,000 maunds a month. Owing to the lack of water it is improbable that regular staging posts could be established as far as Robat, and therefore, through convoys would have to be utilised. With weekly convoys of 450 camels this would require the provision of some 4,500 camels allowing for suitable rests. Until supported by a railway from India, the radius of action of troops in Sistan would be small and practically confined to the area in which supplies are readily available. 70. The question of the force that could be spared from India for operations in Persia depends on the attitude of Afghanistan and the tribes on North-West Frontier, and also on the internal conditions in India. Under normal circumstances it is considered that a force of two divisions and two cavalry brigades could be spared for such external operations ; and if conditions continued normal after their despatch, a further force of the same strength might be sent to reinforce them. The latter force could not, however, be spared if signs of unrest were apparent on the frontier ; and in the extreme case of Afghanis tan making common cause with Persia and inciting the independ ent tribes to do likewise, it is improbable that any troops from India would be available for operations in Persia. (B) The Power of Great Britain and the rest of the Empire to develop force in persia. 71. The question of reinforcements from England and the Colo nies for the defence of India is discussed at some length in Part III (Oversea reinforcements) of the Strategical Study of the North- West Frontier of India. Should events in Persia ever lead to a situation beyond the power of the Army in India to deal with, it may reasonably be assumed that the circumstances governing the despatch of troops will be similar to those which would regulate the despatch of reinforcements to the defence of India. 72. The deductions made in the work referred to above were to the eflect that, under existing military arrangements, the British85 Empire might in favourable circumstances provide reinforcementa as under:— (a) During the first six months of the war— From Great Britain— 1 cavalry division 2 divisions ? . • • • SSjOOO Army troops and administrative units J 20,000 drafts to replace wastage. Total excluding drafts .. 58,000 (6) During the second six months of the war— From Great Britain— 1 mounted brigade 2 divisions f. • .» 49,000 Army troops and administrative units J 31,000 drafts to replace wastage. From British garrisons abroad—• 1 cavalry brigade &gt; 2 artillery brigades / .. .. • • .. 16,000 3 infantry brigades T Administrative units J From self-governing Dominions .. .. 20,000 Total excluding drafts .. 85,000 s (c) During the third six months of the war— From Great Britain— 1 mounted brigade 2 divisions ^. •. 49,000 Army troops and administrative units J 84,000 drafts to replace wastage,. From self-governing Dominions— Fresh units .. .. .. . • .. 5,000 15,000 drafts to replace wastage. Total excluding drafts .. 54,000 From the above, the total available might amount to— From Great Britain .. .. .. .. 156,000 From British garrisons abroad .. .« .. 16,000 From self-governing Dominions .. .. 25,000 Total .. 197,00086 In addition to drafts of 15.0,000 to replace wastage. The latter total includes drafts to replace wastage in the British forces now in India, the greater portion of which it may be assumed would be actively engaged. The above troops would require to be equipped with transport suitable for operations in Persia on arrival, and it is probable that their requirements in this respect would have to be met largely from Indian resources. But in considering the subject of forces available for operations in Persia, it must be borne in mind that the actual number that will be sent will depend on the international situation at the time, and the degree of importance that may be attached to the operations. 73. The conclusions arrived at from the foregoing considerations are that — (i) Forces from India might commence to disembark at a port in the Persian Gulf in about 15 days, and 1 divi sion might disembark complete in 35—40 days from date of the order to take up shipping. (ii) That these might be reinforced by a similar force in an other 15 to 20 days. (iii) That a further force of &gt;2 divisions might, under favour able circumstances as regards the situation in and on the borders of India, follow ; the time taken for their despatch and arrival varying from 35 to 55 days, accord ing to whether the shipping fitted out for the force originally despatched was available or not. ,(iv) That, under the most favourable circumstances as regards the international situation, reinforcements from Great Britain and the rest of the Empire might arrive as noted in paragraph 72, but that owing to the necessity for equipping them with suitable transport not more than | of the numbers given would be available for immediate operations inland. The forces mentioned in (i), (ii), (iii) above could not be moved inland until read transport for use on the line of communications had been provided.87 StiiatEoical deductions. 74. Though the various mountain systems in Persia offer con siderable obstacles to the movement of troops, especially in the limitations they impose to the rapid improvement of communica tions such as the construction of roads and railways, the question of supplies, and in the southern zone also of water, is the chief factor to be considered in endeavouring to forecast possible mili tary operations. The subsistence for any length of time of large bodies of troops, in addition to supplying them with munitions of war, may be considered impracticable at distances of over 200 miles from their base by means of a line of supply of animal trans port working through a barren country and over such roads as exist in Persia. It is true that in North Persia some roads exist which are suitable for mechanical transport. This, no doubt, would prove more economical and efficient than animal transport, but it is doubtful if even the roads classed as fit for wheeled transport would stand heavy and continuous motor traffic, especially in wet weather. 75. With reference to railway construction, as noted in para- gL -aphs 10 and 34, Parti, there are many projects under consideration, No reliable estimates of the possible rate of construction are, how ever, available; in most parts of the country construction would be slow owing to the physical obstacles. It is obvious that any railway construction must considerably modify the questions of military operations ; but it is considered that, as the various projects are still very indefinite both as to the probable date of their commence ment and as to the alignment to be followed, the strategical aspect of each cannot be accurately gauged until further information on above points is obtained. 76. The following arguments are, therefore, based on existing conditions in Persia, as regards to the movements and maintenance of troops in the various areas discussed. ' The estimates of surplus supplies have been taken from the latest and most reliable sources available, but, owing to the lack of accurate information, cannot be absolutely relied on. It is possible that the state of lawlessness into which the country has fallen during the past few years may have tended to reduce the amounts obtainable in some districts, and it must also be remembered that these amounts must vary with the nature of the harvest, especially in districts dependent on a scanty rainfall.88 Similarly the times estimated as requisite for the occupation of the various districts are those which may be expected to obtain under the most favourable circumstances and in the absence of material opposition; the rate of Russian movement would probably be considerably slower from December to March, when quantities of snow fall in most districts in North Persia; on the other hand, the extreme heat of the coast belt would hamper British operations from May to September as would also the state of the passes, across which most of the routes inland lie, in the wet season from December to March. The estimate of possible British moves is also dependent on the question of the taking up of shipping and although based on previous experience in this respect, cannot be regarded as absolutely reliable owing to the possibility of suitable ships not being available in sufficient numbers when required. For the above reasons it will be seen that though, owing to indeterminate conditions, it is not possible to iflake an accurate forecast in any particular case, yet the results arrived at may be accepted as showing the relative rates of the development of force possible at the Various strategical centres in Persia. (a) Russian objectives, possible lines of advance towards them, and rate of development of force along each line, 77. As noted in paragraph 41 a Russian advance into Persia might be based on :— (а) Railhead at Julfa. (б) Enzali or other port on the Caspian Sea. (c) The Central Asian Railway from Askhabad to Tegen. ((i) Railhead at Khushk ; the use of this base would involve passing through Afghan territory. It will be convenient to study each of these lines of advance separately. 78. The first objective of an advance from Julfa would be (a) An advance from Julfa, ?' abrIz .' f f m 1 W . h i ch P ,a ^ ' he f™' mce or Azarbaijan could be domi nated and its resources made available. The distance from Julfa to Tabriz is 78 miles along a good motor road, supplies are abundant, and as the Russians are in effective occupation of Tabriz at present, there would appear no reason why troops should not concentrate at Tabriz from Julfa as fast as they detrain with the necessary transport' at that place.89 The 1st and 2nd Caucasian Army Corps might, therefore, con centrate at Tabriz by the 40th and 55th day of ^Russian mobiliza tion respectively. 79. A subsequent advance would either be — (i) via Binab-Bijar on Hamadan or Kirmanshah, route 4, paragraph 12, Part I; (n) by the post road via Kazvin on Tehran, route 5 idem. By (i) Hamadan is 291 and Kirmanshah 343| miles from Tabriz, the route is only fit for pack transport and is liable to be blocked by snow in winter. Though it might be used by small bodies of troops the passage of large bodies would be a slow processr- By (n) Kazvin is 351 miles and Tehran 437|. This route joins the Kazvin-Hamadan route at Siahdahan, making the total dis tance from Tabrlz-Hamadan 470 miles. As the Kazvin-Hamadan road is bridged and metalled throughout and sivpplies more plenfful it is probable that this route would be more suitable for an advance than the shorter road (t) above. Both Hamadan and Kirmanshah are, however, easier reached from Enzali, distances 297 and 400 miles respectively via Kazvin ; the road is fit for any form of wheeled transport as far as Hamadan and thence to Kirmanshah 103 miles fit for wheeled artillery. It is probable, therefore, that a Russian advance on these places would, under existing circumstances, be based on Enzali, and that the advance from Julfa would be confined to the occupation and subjugation of Azarbaijan, A further argument in favour of such a course is that the line of communication from Enzali, in addition to being shorter, would be relatively immune from attack, while the long line from Julfa via Tabriz to Hamadan would be liable to interference by the warlike Kurdish tribes through whose terri tory it passes and could also be threatened by the Turks from Van. The development of Russian forces at Hamadan and beyond will, therefore, be considered with reference to an advance from Enzali. 80. The first objective of a Russian force based on Enzali /i&gt;\ a j t -d t would be Tehran 234 miles bv a road (6) An advance from Enzah. . . , . ^ j-wau. nt tor any form of wheeled transport, route 6, paragraph 12, Part I. Enzali, Rasht 17 miles and Kazvin 152 miles are already occupied by Russian troops. The necessity for collecting supplies would delay movement, but from Kazvin to S248 GSB90 Tehran a second road exists passable for all arms and lying through a more fertile district. Allowing 26 and 38 days respectively for establishing supply depots along the sections Rasht-Kazvln, Kaz- vin-Tehran, Kazvin and Tehran might be occupied by the 3rd Caucasian Army Corps within 50 days from the date of orders to mobilize, the collection of supplies being concurrent with the movement of troops across the Caspian and landing at Enzali. {See Appendix 4.) 81. Further advance would be— (i) from Kazvin on Hamadan and Kirmanshah, vide para graph 76 ; (ii) from Tehran on Isfahan via the post road, routes 20 and 21, paragraph 12, Part I. By (i) Hamadan, 145 miles, might be occupied in 15 days from Kazvin and Kirmanshah, 248 miles, in another 10 days, allowing for halts to replenish supplies which are not abundant on this route. Considerable amounts of supplies, however, are available at Hamadan and the surplus grain of the Kirmanshah district should suffice to support some 50,000 men, in addition to which additional foodstuffs might be imported via Khaniqin. Taking a brigade of all arms as sufficient for the occupation of Hamadan in the first instance and subsequent reinforcements arriving at the rate of 5,000 a week, the Russians might concentrate an army corps (50,000 men in round numbers) at and about Hama dan and Kirmanshah in 70 days from the date of orders to mobilize. This number could be supported in the district with a line of animal or motor transport supply from Enzali, 300 miles, for depart mental and other supplies not locally obtainable. {See Appen dix 5.) 82. The next objectives of a Russian advance would be Burii- jird and Khurramabad, 66 and 130 miles from Hamadan respect ively, the first section, a road fit for wheeled traffic and with con siderable supplies, the second section being a mule track through hilly and barren country, Khurramabad can also be reached from Kirmanshah, 110 miles, by a road passable by artillery with fair quantities of supplies, but closed by snow in winter.91 Further progress to the south must be by the Khurramabad- Dizful road, a mule track 157 miles across mountainous country almost devoid of supplies. • In the event of opposition therefore, further Russian advance in this direction would hardly be possible as long as, based by road on Enzali, 430 miles from Khurramabad, as the ultimate base; and Russian radius of action in this direction may be taken as limited to the occupation of Kirmanshah and Ramadan with forces that mi ^ht reach 60,000 men, with advanced detachments of perhaps 5 000 men atBurujird and Khurramabad. In the absence of any form of opposition however, a small detachment equipped With mule transport might be pushed on to Dizful, but such a force is unlikely to exceed 3,000 men under existing ciroumstances. A Russian movement west from Kirminshah towards Baghdad, 220 mile 0 is also possible, as the route is easy and supplies abundant!' Owing, however, to the length of communications (Baghdad -Enzali, 600 miles) such an operation may be considered improbable. 83 No other port on the Persian shore of the Caspian Sea offers the same facilities for landing troops or communication inland as does Enzali, and, therefore, it is unlikely that any other would be used for serious Operations, though detachments might be landed at Barfurush and Ashurada to occupy the immediate neighbourhood. 81 An advance from Tehran on Isfahan would be by the post road via Qum -Kashan, 298 miles, fit for wheeled traffic throughout Supplies in large quantities are only available at Qum, Kashan and Katanz The scarcity of water along this route would limit the size nt detachments, but allowing for an average rate of despatch of 600 men a day and for halts to stock depSts, etc., the movement of Riiss : an troops along.this route might be as ndicated in Appen- dix No. 6. 85 It is estimated that supplies for about 12,000 men can be counted on at Isfahan, and, therefore, a Russian force of this size might be in occupation of that place in 105 days from the date of orders to mobilize. Further development of force would depend on the possibility of maintaining a line of animal or mechanical transport from the base; but as supplies in large quantities are not92 obtainable at Tehran, and the total distance from Enzali to Isfahan is 522 miles, it is improbable that a material increase to the above lorce could be made. 86. Further advance from Isfahan would be on Ahwaz, 276 miles, Shiraz, 296 miles, Yazd, 188 miles. Along all these roads supplies are scarce and in view of the lengthening of the line of communica tion, a further advance would hardly be possible under existing circumstances and if any ( pposition were anticipated. In the absence of opposition, however, detachments might be pushed on to occupy theie pla es, but, under existing condi tions, such forces i ie unlikely to exceed 1 ,500 to Ahwaz and perhaps 3,000 each to Shiraz and Yazd. 87. An advance from the Central Asian Railway would have Meshed as its first objective. For (c) An advance from the Cen- this purpose the Askhabad-Kuchan- tral As.an Ra.lway. ^ ^ ^ fit ^ wheels throughout is the most probable line of advance. Supplies as far as Kuchan, 79 miles, are scanty, but thence on to Meshed abund ant. As the Russians are already in occupation of Meshed, there would appear nothing to prevent troops in daily echelons of 1,000 men moving from Askhabad to that place. Though the imme diate vicinity of Meshed is not very fertile, it is estimated that the resources of North Khorasan are sufficient for some 15,000 men, the most fertile district being Kuchan. The Russians might, there fore, concentrate and maintain a force of 15,000 men at Meshed in some five weeks from the date of orders to mobilize, vide paragraph 42. {See Appendix 7.) This force might be considerably increased by establishing a line of supply with Askhabad. 88. Further progress to the south-west is barred by the Dasht-i- KaVlr and the next objective would be either Sistan or Herat, As, however, an advance on the latter place could more easily and quickly be made from railhead at Khushk, operations from Meshed would probably be confined to an advance on Sistan. 89. From Meshed to Nasratabad, distance 500 miles, there are two routes reroutes 16 and 17, paragraph 12, Part I. Owing to lack of supplies, however, the movement of large bodies of troops by either would present great difficulties and would only be possible after establishing and stocking large supply depots at intermediate stages.As all food supplies for a considerable force are obtainable in Sistan, 12,000 men at the rate of 2,000 men a week might march with transport to carry supplies for the stages where least is obtainable. {See Appendix 8.) Thus the Russians might, if unopposed, concentrate 12,000 men in Sistan in 100 days from th3 date of orders to mobilize. Further reinforcement would, however, be difficult as the passage of the above troops would probably have denuded the routes of supplies and additional depots would have to be stocked by a line of supply from Meshed. If, owing to the previous occupation of Sistan by a hostile force' the movements of troops in small detachments as above was not feasible, operations from Meshed towards Sistan would be a matter of great difficulty, as there is no locality on the route south of Turbat-i-Haidari in which supplies are sufficient for a large force. It is probable, therefore, that in the event of serious opposition being anticipated in the neighbourhood of Sistan an advance from Khushk via Herat would offer better prospects of success. A further advantage of the latter course would be the possi bility of, to a great extent, avoiding the obstacle afforded by the Hamun by a detour to the east via Chakansur. 90. An advance from Khushk post might be made on Meshed or ' t Herat, but as the former place is (d) An advance from rail- ( u :^ Q f Khnahk far more easily accessible from head a t Khuahk. Askhabad, Herat would be the first objective of an advance from this direction. 91. The question of a Russian advance from Khushk on Kan dahar has been considered in detail in the Strategical Study of the North-West Frontier, where it is shown that a force of 15,000 Russian troops might occupy Herat within 30 days from the date of orders to mobilize, and further that some 60,000 might be collected in the area of Herat and Farah by the 60th day. 92. From Herat to Sistan there are two routes :~ (1) Via Farah 163 miles, and thence by two roads on either bank of the Farah Rud, 60 miles to Juwain. Total 213 miles. Supplies are obtainable in large quantities at Sabzawar and Farah, but scarce from that place to Juwain. Road fit for wheeled artillery throughout.94 (2) Vid Parali and Anardara to Juwain, 218 miles, fit fof field artillery with supplies available at 10 out of 18 stages. This route was traversed by the Afghan Boundary Mission in 1884 with 1,200 men, 660 horses and mules and 1,200 camels. The capacity of either route may be taken as a brigade in one echelon marching with 10 days' supplies. Considerable quantities of supplies are available at Juwain and its immediate neighbour hood. By using both routes, the Russians might, therefore, con centrate 10,000—12,000 men at Juwain in 20—25 days from Herat or 50—55, say 60, days from the date of orders to mobilize. From Juwain to Nasratabad is 60—=70 miles according to the route chosen, when the Helmand is in flood a considerable detour to the east having to be made. The Russians might, therefore, occupy Slstan with 12,000 men from Herat in about 70 days from the date of orders to mobilize and subsequently increase that force up to the capacity of the district for supply. Further advance into Persia would, however, be barred by the Dasht-i-Lut. (6) Turkish objectives, possible lines of advance towards them, and rate of development of force along each line. 93. The Turks might advance from Asia Minor and Mesopota mia (а) from Van vid Kh5I on Tabriz; (б) from Baghdad vid Khaniqin on Kirmanshah ; (c) from Basrah on Muhammareh or Kuwait. 94. From Van to Khoi, about 130 miles on a road fit for wheels, (a) An advance from Van. with fair quantities of supplies, thence to Tabriz 96 miles on a road of the same description. As stated in paragraph 47, information is not available from which to make an estimate of the possible rate of concentration of Turkish troops in this neighbourhood. From a comparison with paragraphs 42 and 78 it is evident that any advance could be met by superior Russian forces concentrated by rail at Julfa. There is no physical obstacle to such an advance, however, and the possibility of the Turks advancing with a force of even 20,000 men and at the same time raising the Kurdish tribesmen of95 Azarbai jan is a factor of importance in considering a Russian advance from tTulfa into Persia, 95. From Baghdad to Kirmanshah is 222 miles, by a route passable by wheeled traffic except (b) An advance from Baghdad ra j n- Supplies plentiful through- on Kirmanshah. ou t. The existing strength of the Baghdad Army Corps is given in paragraph 46, and from what is known of Turkish organization and preparedness for mobi lization it is improbable that an effective force for offensive operations could be readily concentrated in Mesopotamia. Nevertheless, with improved organization it is apparent from comparison with paragraphs 81 and 109 that the Turks could occupy Kirmanshah with a force of 15,000—20,000 men before either the Russians or British could develop strength in that quarter. Such action would materially affect the possibility of occupation of that district by either of these latter Powers, as it would prevent the advance of troops in relatively small echelons through the infertile districts which have to be traversed by either to reach Kirmanshah ; and also by removing or destroying sur plus stocks the support of large bodies of troops on reaching Kirmanshah would be rendered very precarious if not impractic able. The completion of the Baghdad Railway will very materially increase the power of the Turks for an offensive on this line. 96. From Basrah to Muhammareh is 25 miles by road down the left bank of the Shatt-al-'Arab. (r) An advance from Basrah p resen t garrison of Basrah on Muhammareh. maybe regarded as ineffective for offensive operations and an estimate of the time necessary for the concentration of Turkish forces is given in paragraph 47. The total at the end of 8 weeks is probably not more than would be Bufficient to overcome the resistance which the Shaikh of Muham mareh could oppose to an advance and a comparison with para graph 108 shows that the British, to whom the Shaikh would look to for protection, could develop force at Muhammareh faster than the Turks at Basrah. 97. Kuwait is 114 miles from Basrah by a desert route lacking in supplies and water and the same arguments apply to a Turkish advance in this direction. A factor which, however, would have to be considered is the action of the Muntafik Arabs who have long been at enmity with the Shaikh of Kuwait. and whose co-operation might be secured by the Turks in the case of a religious war.96 (c) British objectives, possible lines of advance towards them, and rate of development of force on each line, 98. As has been pointed out in paragraph 13 on the subject of British policy in Persia and in the Gulf regions, though the occupation or administration of any part of Persia is not at present contemplated, future and not improbable events may necessitate some modification of our present policy. Without attempting to indicate the lines such change of policy is likely to follow a summary of British power as regards the occupation of the chief strategical centres in Southern Persia and in the Gulf regions is given below. 99. The possible objectives of British operations might be (а) One or other of the ports along the Arabian Sea or Gulf littoral. (б) Important centres in the Southern Zone in Persia, of which the most probable are Sistan, Kirman, Shiraz, the Kariin valley as far as Shushtar and Dizfal and, in the event of trouble with Turkey, Basrah in lower Mesopotamia. 100. Under existing circumstances there is no question of our ^ power effectively to occupy any w The oooupatou of a Guli po i n t on the coast at will. The num- bers necessary for effective occupa tion of each place would vary to some extent, but so long as opera tions inland were not contemplated a force of from 2 battalions to a brigade and I battery as a maximum should suffice to effect a landing and resist probable offensive action from the interior at any point on either shore of the Gulf. The time necessary to land a force as above is estimated at from 15—20 days, vide paragraph 68. The question of further development of force at any selected port on the Gulf is also dealt with in paragraph 73. 101. Under present conditions no serious opposition to an occupation of Sistan need be anti- (6) The occupation of im- cipated. The question of the possi- portant centres. bility of developing force in Sistan Si3t5,a - has been discussed in paragraph 69. It will be seen that the occupation of Sistan by a considerable de tachment moving from India is a feasible, though very difficult and lengthy operation. Owing to the large quantities of supplies97 available in that district such a detachment could be maintained on arrival, but it is obvious that movements outlined in para graph 69 could not be carried out if there was any prospect of encountering serious opposition on arrival, for there is no locality, short of the fertile area of Sistan, where the detachments could concentrate. A comparison with the estimates arrived at in para graphs 89 and 92 show that the Russians would have an advantage in this respect and that unless we were assured of sufficient start to allow our detachments reaching Sistan in advance of the Russians, the operation would be too dangerous to adopt. And further, though the position in Sistan might well be held by relatively small forces against a Russian advance from Meshed, it would probably prove precarious against the forces which they might develop against it from Herat and Farah, especially in view of the length of communications with India and the difficulty of reinforcement. 102. Further movement to the west is blocked by the Dasht-i- Lut, vide route 13 paragraph 36, Part I; while an advance northwards would only be practicable for small bodies of troops along route 18 idem. Until such time as communication with India had been assured by the construction of a railway to Sistan, the maximum radius of action of any force in occupation of Sistan would be to maintain a detachment at Birjand, 210 miles, of such strength as could be mainly supported by local resources at that place, at most 1 brigade. 103. Kirman is from 270—338 miles from Bandar 'Abbas accord ing to the route used, wrfe route 11, Occupation of K.rman, para g ra p h 36, Part I. Owing to the lack of water and supplies the capacity of these routes is estimated as not to exceed 2 battalions marching in one echelon on each; and for the same reason, the maintenance of a line of animal transport to deliver any considerable quantity of supplies would be a matter of great difficulty. It is considered that a brigade of all arms would be sufficient to overcome any probable resistance on the road to and at Kirman. This is further the larg est force that could be supported in the first instance from local resources coupled with a proportion of supplies forwarded from the coast. Subsequently if arrangements were made for the collection of supplies from the Narmashir district, distant some 120 miles, the force might be increased to a division by sending one brigade to Bahramabad to subsist. This, however; would be the maximum force as long as based by existing communications with Bandar 'Abbas. S248 GSB98 ^ lOt. Allowing for a brigade with transport disembarking at Bandar 'Abbas by the 22nd day Kirman might be occupied by the 55th day after the order to take up shipping was given. This period would allow for halts at Daulatabad and Baft to collect 'supplies. Further development of force would depend on the supplies actually found available in the neighbourhood, but it is improbable that any material increase could be made for at least one month from the time of the arrival of the force noted abov?, (See Appendix 9.) . 105. The radius of action of a force in occupation of Kirman would be limited to the vicinity of that place owing to the lack of supplies along the routes leading to the north and to the length of communication with the coast. 106. Shiraz is connected with Bushire bv two routes (route 4, Occupation of Shiriz. paragraph 36, Part I). The circum- stances of the moment would decide which route would be adopted for an advance. An advance vzd Kazarun would probably be opposed by the Qashgai and Khamseh tribes and a force of at least 2 brigades is considered necessary to open up the road to Shiraz and also, owing to the difficulty of the route, the troops would have to be equipped with all mule transport and it would be necessary to establish a line of supply of mule transport from Kazarun to Shiraz. Though lacking in water at some stages the Firuzabad route is easier and fit for camel trans port ; it is probable therefore that a deliberate advance with a view to permanent occupation would be by this line along which a line of supply for a large force could be established. As regards supplies, until opposition had been overcome, it would probably be necessary to send nearly all supplies from the coast, but after the occupation of Shiraz and with a good system of collection it is considered that one division could be subsisted on the neighbouring country. With improvements to communications with the coast and using a line of animal transport on both routes, a force of perhaps 3 divisions might be maintained at Shiraz, as the length of road and difficulties as regards water are less than is the case with Kir man. 107, As regards the rate of development of force, if the rate of taking up shipping given in paragraph 68 were attained, a division might disembark at Bushire in about 35—40 days from the date of the order to take up the shipping. As the advance could begintfs soon as 2 brigades were complete, SMraz might be occupied about the 50th day and the division complete be concentrated in the Shiraz valley by the 55th to 60th day. Further development of force would depend on improvement to communications, but it is improbable that any material addition could be made for at least a month. (See Appendix 10.) - » 108. A force in occupation of Shiraz would dominate the province of Fars. Movement to the north as far as Deh Bid, 106 miles would present no difficulty, but thence to Isfahan, 172 miles,' and to Yazd, 133 miles, lack of supplies would limit the movement of troops to small detachments unless considerable preparations in the way of stocking depots were undertaken. As supplies for 12,000 men are reported as available at Isfahan, troops in small echelons might be pushed on to that place, with supply columns carrying 7 days' supplies and provided no opposition was anticipated on arrival. By this means, provided further troops were available to replace the troops as they advanced from Shiraz, the leading detachment might arrive at Isfahan in about 100 days from the date of taking up shipping and 12,000 men concentrate in some 110 days. {See Appendix 11.) Owing to the length (480 miles from Bushire) and difficult nature of communications, however, the operation would be a very risky one, unless undertaken with the absolute certainty of forestalling a possible opponent. In this connection a comparison should be made with the estimated rate of a Russian advance in paragraph 85. As the local resources of Yazd are said to be insufficient to provide for the needs of the population an advance on that place could not be undertaken until a line of supply could be organised from Deh Bid. Should the necessity for the occupation of Yazd occur it might be occupied by 1 Brigade about the 85th day from the date of taking up shipping. (See Appendix 12.) 109. The question of the occupation of 'Arabistan would depend on the attitude of the Shaikh of Mu- Occupation of Shushtar and hammareh. To overcome opposition Dizftl. , by his followers it is probable that a force of a division would be necessary. It might well be, however, that if he were threatened by the Turks from the west or by the Bakhtiari from the north he would not oppose and might even assist British operations. Owing to the possibility of using water transport for the greater part of the way and to the open nature of the country an advance into North 'Arabistan would not present the same100 difficulties as an advance from the coast into other parts of Persiaj The resources of 'Arabistan are considered sufficient to support a force of some 20,000 men, while by means of water transport, it should be possible to maintain a considerable army at Shushtar and Dizful. With an output by this means of 200 tons a day at Shushtar in addition to local resources a force of 4 divisions could be maintained in Northern 'Arabistan. 110. In the absence of opposition at Muhammareh troops might begin to land in 15 days from the date of taking up shipping and a division complete disembarked in 35—40. Shushtar and Dizful could be occupied in another 15 to 20 days, making a total of 55 days. Further reinforcements, up to the limits of available supplies as in the preceding paragraph, might arrive at the rate of some 8,000 to 10,000 a week, vide paragraph 68. 111. A further advance would be:— ' {i) on Khurramabad, 157 miles, and Burujird, 220 miles, or Kirmanshah, 268 miles, from Dizful; {ii) on Isfahan, 276 miles by the Lynch road from Ahwaz. {i) is described as a mule road and devoid of supplies except grazing for horses and mules at certain stages, though the Khurram abad and Kirmanshah section, 110 miles, is passable by wheeled artillery and through a country with fair quantities of supplies. Supplies for a small force would be available at Burujird and in very large quantities at Kirmanshah. The necessity for carrying or stocking supplies and for equipping a force with mule transport would therefore necessitate considerable delay before an advance could be undertaken in this direction, except by small bodies of troops, which could not be adequately reinforced until the road had been made passable for camel or cart transport and supplies stocked. In the absence of opposition, however, it is probable that detachments equipped with mule transport could be pushed on to occupy Khurramabad : such a force is however unlikely to exceed some 3,000 men. For an advance by {ii) on Isfahan the road is fit for carts for 42 miles and thence in parts for mules only. Supplies are obtainable in small quantities only, generally for about 100 men and 500 animals at each stage. An advance would therefore be only practicable for small bodies of troops carrying considerable quantities of sup plies. As the road leads through the heart of the Bakhtiari country, an advance might meet with considerable opposition and the march101 of small detachments of troops would not in that case prove feas ible. It is probable therefore that the occupation of Isfahan could be better achieved from Shiraz, vide paragrah 108. If, however, the Bakhtiari were friendly and prepared to give assistance by collecting supplies, Isfahan might perhaps be reached sooner by this route than via Shiraz. 112. The town of Basrah is 67 miles up the Shatt-al-'Arab. Under ^ . existing circumstances and in the ab- An vance on asra . sence of fortifications along the river an advance by water would probably be feasible. With the co-operation of the Shaikh of Muhammareh an advance from that place up the left bank of the Shatt-al-'Arab followed by the passage of the river might also be effectual. The question of the rate of development of Turkish forces at Basrah is discussed in paragraph 47, and the force required for its occupation would depend on the circumstances of the moment and on how far Turkish preparations had progressed by the time a blow could be delivered; similarly the time necessary to concentrate the necessary forces would depend on the amount of force required under the circumstances. 113. Owing to the swamps and deserts which practically surround the place any further advance could only be by water towards Baghdad; and for the same reason Basrah would be easy to defend against a counter movement and it is considered that one division should prove ample to resist any attack that could be brought by the Turks and Arabs against it. t 101—102 \103 PART III. ^ ) General Conclusions^ 1. An attempt will be now made to indicate the more import ant conclusions which may be drawn from a study of the condi tions outlined in the foregoing pages. j 2. The information contained in Part I shows - (a) That, in the Northern Zone, Russian interests and trade largely predominate, no other European Power except Great Britain having, at present, any interests worth men tioning in the zone. This part of Persia too is the richest and most populous, so that its larger supplies both of food and water, its better roads, and the greater facilities it offers for railway construction, give Russia great military advantages over any other Power for operations within this zone. (&amp;) That, in the Southern Zone, Great Britain is practically the only foreign Power that has any interests or trade at all. But its sparse population, its smaller supplies of food and water, its bad roads and the difficulties the mountain ranges offer to all railway construction from the sea, render military operations on any large scale within the zone very difficult, if not impracticable, (c) That, in lower Mesopotamia, Great Britain is at present the only foreign Power that has any trade interests ; but that with the advent of the Baghdad Railway, German trade interests will rapidly increase and form a pretext on which to advance political claims, {d) That, on the Arabian littoral. Great Britain has predomi nant interests, both political and commercial, with the local tribes, though Turkey has rather nebulous political claims to certain portions of the coast line, (e) That the arms traffic across the Gulf is having a serious effect in the regions bordering on the North-West Frontier of India, and that Great Britain is interested in estab lishing some form of effective government in Southern Persia on this account alone; so that the movement of arms across it to the North-West Frontier of India may be more effectively checked. Moreover, the free importation of arms is one of the principal contributory causes of the present disturbed state of Southern Persia.104 if) That there are good positions to the north of the Oman Peninsula for the establishment of a British naval base and coaling station, which would ensure our command of the exit from the Gulf in the future. . . 3. From Part II we learn that while the declared policy of both Russia and Great Britain is to maintain the integrity of Persia, it ia evidently in'the interests of Russia to take over Northern Persia, just as it is in that of Great Britain to maintain the status quo. But it is also clear that it is in the interests of the trade of both Powers to establish an efficient government in Persia, while the necessity for this will be pressed with even greater insistence with the completion of the Baghdad Railway and its branches and the development of the trade interests of Germany and other Powers through this channel into Persia. Meanwhile the Persian Government shows no signs of being able to maintain order in the country, while it gradually in creases its debt to foreign Powers without making any permanent advance towards increased efficiency. Its officials are unpatriotic and corrupt and govern more in their own personal interests than that of the country they nominally serve. Under such circumstances a change of policy leading to the partition of Persia seems inevitable sooner or later. 4. When that time comes, it is clear that the armed forces of Russia, which she possesses for use in support of her policy, will be greatly superior to those of any other Power. Great Britain, while still predominant everywhere along the coast of the Gulf, will have to reckon in future with the navies of other Powers having growing interests in Mesopotamia and Persia, Turkey, although a military power of some strength, will take many years to recover from the results of the Balkan War, and will count for little in Persian politics for a long time to come. It is possible, however, that the loss of a great portion of her European possessions, and the consequent decrease of her responsibilities in the West, may eventually lead to an increase of energy and efficiency in Asia Minor and her out lying Asiatic provinces, which have hitherto been regarded as of minor importance. With the advent of railways in Persia the power of Russia to use her armed forces over larger portions of Persia will steadily increase, and later on the same remark will apply to Turkey, and possibly to Germany, as the interests of the two latter countries increase in Asia Minor and Mesopotamia. 5. An abstract of the power of the principal countries concerned to develop forces at different places in Persia under present conditions i.e., before the advent of railways, is given in the following table.105 Russia.

(c) To these dates 15 days extra should perhaps I e added to allow for Russian mobilization commencing before news of it can reach Great Britain. In the Strategical Study of the N.-W. F. of India this allowance is put at thirty days ; but for mobilization on the borders of Persia this interval should not be so long as when mobilization is undertaken in Central Asia and Russian Turkistan. (d) Dependent on the opposition to be anticipated and whether owing to the absence of fortification an advance up the river by water is feasible. 6. The forego'ng table shows that under existing conditions Great Britain should be able to hold the line Sistan-Bam-Kirman- Yazd -Abadah -Dizful-Pusht-i-Kuh against Russia at the outset of a campaign; but as Russ'a completes railways in Northern Persia, our forces would be pushed back behind this line. Further, when through railways are completed in Persia, running to places, such as Bandar 'Abbas, on the sea board, Great Britain would have great difficulty in holding these ports and the extent of the country she could successfully occupy in war would thon be that bounded by a line running halfway between her bases on the sea S24SGSB106 coast and Eussian bases on the through railway line across Persia. The power of Great Britain to do even this much will depend how ever on her being able to find sufficient troops. On tbe other hand, as a war with Russia will also mean operations in Afghan istan ; and as we shall require all the forces of the Empire to hold the Kabul-Kandahar line in that country with any prospect of eventual success, it is evident, that we should have no men available for employment in Persia unless the military forces of the British Empire are considerably increased. 7. But notwithstanding this position of weakness there is no reason why our frontier line in Persia, if and when that country is partitioned, should be withdrawn even to the line we might hold at the commencement of a campaign, as given in paragraph 6. There are many good reasons for adopting a more forward line for our boundary, as this would keep Russia further away from points where our interests are vital and give us more time to organize forces, etc., to defend these interests in the event of war. Such a line might run from NamakSar (on the Perso-Afghan Fron tier west-south-west of Herat), by the Binar Pass (north-west of Kain), to Tabas south-east of the Dasht-i-Kavir) thenoe to Qumishah (50 miles South of Isfahan) and so to the Persian Gulf at Bandar-Dilam. We could hold this country in peace with two Indian divisions with headquarters at Shiraz and Kirman respectively; assisted by local ••forces raised in the country. This might of course necessitate some increase to the Army in India. 8. Although we can evidently hold 'Arabistan, at present, against Russia, and Basrah against Turkey; we shall be unable to do so after through railways have been made. It would there fore appear more advantageous to maintain the independence of 'Arabistan under some local chief or chiefs by an international gua rantee, rather than to occupy it ourselves with the probability of having to withdraw from it at the outbreak of war, after through railways have once been made. 9. At the mouth of the Gulf we should, however, take care to make our naval position absolutely secure and be prepared for action with that end in view as soon as the opportunity arises. On the Arabian littoral we should lose no time in consolidating our position tis a vis Turkey so that our rights in that region may be beyond dispute.109 XII (Musal) Army Corps— 36th Kirkuk Division— 36th Nishanji battalion 106th regiment 107 th regiment ^ = 9 battalions 108th regiment J = 350 average 200— 1,800 No machine guns with infantry regiments, 36th regiment field artillery = 3 batteries 36th company mounted infantry .. 35th Musal Division— 35th Nishanji battalion 103rd regiment 'j ^ 104th regiment V ^ 9 battalions @ average 200 - 105th regiment J No machine guns with infantry regiments. 35th regiment field artillery = 3 batteries . • 35th company mounted infantry Corps Troops (Headquarters Musal)— 12th Cavalry brigade (33rd, 34th, 35th regiments) 4 batteries mountain artillery 1 battery mountain artillery 12th engineer battalion, with pontoon train No telegraph company. 12th train battalion (50 carts, 250 pack mules).

There is no cavalry and no artillery available for these Redif Divisions. These two Army Corps are at present scattered in detachments over a wide area. 2.

It will be noted that the governing factors are (i) the rate of concentration and mobi lization at Baghdad ; and (ii) the capacity of navigation of the river Tigris between Baghdad and Basrah (405 miles). 3. Au advance from Nushki on Sis tan. Part II, paragraph 69, Nushki to Nasratabad is 28 marches ; assuming the inhabit ants of Sistan were friendly, our detachment at Robat, 21 marches, with the help of locally collected transport should be able to stock supplies on the section Robat-Nasratabad and possibly also for a few stages on the near side of Rob at. This would leave arrangements to be made from India for 18 stages plus 2 halts, say 20 days' supplies. Detachments of 800 men, 50 horses or mules and 400 camels carrying 12 days' food for men and 50 lbs. forage for animals would require depots at intervals along the route containing a total supplementary supply of 10 days' food for men and 150 lbs. forage for animals to supplement camel grazing obtainable to enable them to accomplish the march to Robat, i.e., 800x10x3 + 450x150= 91.500 lbs. or approximately 41 tons. 18 such detachments (14,400 men, 900 horses and mules, i.e., the approximate strength of a division, less cavalry and field artillery, with all camel transport) would require some 740 tons. This amount could best be stocked at intervals along the route at the most convenient stages. The stages given in the route book as most suitable for halts are the 4th, 7th, 11th and 15th ; and we should, therefore, have to place an average of 185 tons at each of these stages. The camels used to stock these depots would also have to carry a proportion of forage to supplement grazing ; the totals of these camels thus become To stock 1st depot, 4 marches, carrying 70 lbs. forage per camel requires, if 400—70 = 3301bs. is useful load of each camel, *85*28x89^1 255 camels. 330 To stock 2nd depot, 7 marches, carrying 130 lbs. forage pel , 185 X 28 X 80 -| tfO'i 1 camel requires 270 =1,001 camels. To stock 3rd depot, 11 marches, carrying 200 lbs. forage per 185 X 28 X 80 „ r . r . 0 , camel requires '200 —2,072 camels. To stock 4th depot, 15 marches, carrying 200 lbs. forage per camel requires 2,072.camels as for the 3rd depot.112 The camels carrying stores to the first two depots would return to Nushki and would be available for the equipment of troops ; those for the 3rd and 4th depots would proceed to Robat to assist in stocking the last section of the road and to avoid congestion on the road back to Nushki. The total thus comes to 6,960 camels for stocking the road. Assuming that camels can be collected at Nushki at the rate of one camel corps a day after the 15th day of mobilization and that echelons of 1 camel corps (880 useful loads after deducting spare, etc.) start on alternate days commencing from the 16th, the last echelon would leave Nushki on the 30th day and the first echelon of troops might start on the 32nd day. Allowing 32 days for the march to Nasratabad and for echelons of the strength mention ed above, a division, less mounted troops and with all camel transport, might be concentrated in Sistan in 32-{-32-1-36^=100, say 120 days or 4 months from the date of orders to mobilize. 4. An advance from Enzali.—Pa t II, fa ag aph 80. Any calculations regarding the rate of development along routes in Northern Persia must be very approximate, as the data available are so uncertain. The first step to be taken would pre sumably be to stock a depot at Kazyin for the supply of troops en route to Tehran or Hamadan, Kazvln is a town of 40,000 inhabitants, and fair quantities of supplies are available in the surrounding district, while large quantities could be imported from the Zinjan district, distance 40 miles. As Kazvin is in effective occupation by Russian troops there should be no difficulty in collecting supplies for the leading detachments. To supplement these, however, a line of supply from the base would probably be necessary later on. It is hard to say what class of transport would be used for this purpose. Local transport is entirely pack and consists of camels, mules and donkeys, of which very large numbers work along the road to Enzali. It is probable, however, that these would be supplemented by housed carts or motor transport from Russia. The 3rd Caucasian Army Corps has a strength of 49,200 men 15,380 animals (Table C), and it can be concentrated at Enzali on the 34th day from the date of orders to mobilize [Part II, para graph 42 (2)] ; it will require 200 tons per dicn to supply it with rations, grain and fodder. (S. S., N.-W. F., Table B.) These 15,380 equipment animals carry 9 days' food for men, less 2 days' meat on113 hoof; 1^ days' corn for horses, no fodder; 3 days' corn for transport animals, 2 days' fodder (S. S., N.-W. F, Table A). Thus before the army corps can move from Enzali to Kazvin, 12 marches, we must have at least some 3 days' food for men and 12 days' forage for animals collected along the route. If we assume that this can be done by transport animals, who themselves carry 10 lbs. forage per diem each, the balance required being made up from local collections, then we can use Table G, by which over an average of 6 stages 3,149 five-maund animals, or their equivalent, can move 35*7 tons per diem. We require some 200 tons X 10 =2,000 tons spread out over this road, i.e., say over an average of 6 stages, before this army corps can march to Kazvin; and this would take 3,149 animals 60 days to effect or 19,000 animals 10 days. In the S. S., N.-W. F. it was assumed that Russia could collect 30,000 five-maund animals on the Afghan frontier per month. We may perhaps assume, that during the 14 days' railway preparation before concentration begins, Russia could collect 19,000 animals or their equivalent ready to move to Enzali and that it would take 6 days of con centration to move them to Enzali with sufficient supplies. This would put back the commencement of the concentration of the 3rd Caucasian Corps from the 14th to the 20th day and its completion from 34th to 40th day. During the 26 days in which these animals and the 3rd Corps are concentrating at Enzali, the 19,000 animals will be able to provision the Enzali-Kazvin line and also Kazvin sufficiently, so as not to delay the brigades, etc., of the 3rd Corps moving to Kazvin on their arrival at Enzali and it should therefore be concentrated at the latter place in 40 + 12=52 days from date of Russian mobilization commencing. From Kazvin to Tehran is 6 marches through a country with fair supplies. If the country were friendly, probably sufficient supplies could be collected locally for the leading detachments after arriving at Kazvin and halting and replenishing there to push on to Tehran at once. But if the country were hostile, this might not be possible and it would be necessary to collect supplies en route by transport ing them from Kazvin. The 19,000 transport animals, or their equivalent, will have provisioned the Enzali-Kazvin route for the 3rd Corps to advance by the 30th day of Russian mobilization, and after that date will be partly available for work on the Kazvin- Tehran route. Say that, for one division, we require 300 tons collected along this line, at an average of 4 stages, and that we can use Table G by which 1,985 five-maund animals can move 35'7 tons daily over 14 stages ; or 300 tons in 8 days. Thus the road should S248GSB114 be provisioned throughout for 1 division to advance to Tehran by, at latest, the 38th day fr. m the date of orders to mobilize. The lead ing division should be concentrating at Kazvin between the 34th and 44th day of Russian mobilization, so that one division could be concentrated at Tehran and 1 division at Kazvin by the 50th day of Russian mobilization, allowing for some expedition in the rear division moving on Kazvin. 5. Advance on Hamadan. —Part II, paragraph 81. The preceding Appendix shows the possibility of concentratin * 50,000 men in Kazvin by the 50th day from the date of orders to mobilize. Should the objective of the Russian forces be Hamadan and Kirmanshah a further advance might be made as follows :— Kazvin to Hamadan is 8 long marches along a good road with an estimated supply capacity of 1 brigade. It should be possible to move from Kazvin before the whole of the above force is collected, say, soon after the leading division commences to concentrate there i.e., on the 36th day from the date of &lt; rders to mobilize. The opposition is not likely to be great, so the leading brigade of the division should occupy Hamadan by the 45th day from the date of orders to mobilize. Subsequently detachments carrying 10 days' food and grain supplies could be passed along the road, though fodder depots would have to be formed. Owing to the larger quantities of supplies available along the route an average of 50 lbs. forage per animal would probably suffice to supplement local resources. Thus, for the 15,000 animals of a Russian Army Corps 15,000 x 50 = 750,000 lbs. = 350 tons would be wanted, spread out along the road i.e., over an average of 5 marches. Using table G, 2,551 five-maund animals or their equivalent could deliver this in 10 days. Allowing them 5 days for his transport getting into position, the collection would be finished within 15 days of the leading brigade starting from Kazvin i.e., by 50th day from the date of orders to mobilize. Subsequently the remainder of the 50,000 men could march in detachments of 5,000 each day and be concentrated at Hamad in in 8 + 9 = 17 days i.e., on 68th day from the date of orders to mobilize. Though considerable quantities of supplies are available at Hamadan the amount would probably not suffice for this number, so troops would have to be pushed on to Kirmanshah to subsist. As the road, 103 miles in 6 stages, passes through a well-supplied country, detachments of 3,000 — 4,000 men might push on after halting at Hamadan to replenish supplies and thus the leading division might be at Kirmanshah and the remainder of the Army Corps at Hamadan by the 70th day from the date of orders to mobilize.115 Though local food supplies could probably be easily obtained in this area it would be necessary to maintain a line of supply from the base for munitions of war, etc. On a basis of 15 per cent, of total food supplies an army corps would require some 30 tons per day. A line of supply from Rasht to Hamadan, 18 marches, to give a daily output of 35 tons a day would, using table G, require 13,500 camels, and to forward | that amount on to Kirmanshah, 6 marches further, at least 1,600 additional animals would be wanted. It is probable, however, that by the time these places are occupied (2 months) the Russians would have organised a more economical line of supply as far as Kazvin or possibly to Hamadan, viz., either carts or motor transport, or possibly a combination of the two. 6. An advance on Isfahan. —Part II, paragraph 84. The road to Isfahan would be divided into sections viz., to Qum 6 marches, to Kashan 11, to Natanz 15, to Isfahan 22 marches. Sup plies in considerable quantities are available at Qiim and Kashan and in fair quantities at Natanz. Scarcity of water would, however, limit the size of detachments on the section Qum-Natanz to probably 500 men with animals. Troops moving with 10 days' supplies could reach Isfahan in 30 days from Tehran, allowing 8 days for halts to collect supplies. A proportion of fodder would probably have to be stocked to supplement local supplies on the road. Taking 12,003 men and 4,000 animals as the force which could be supported at Isfahan on local resources after arrival there, depots on the several sections might be stocked as under Tehran-Q im 6 marches at .. .. 40 lbs. per animal. This would necessitate placing 80, 60, 40 and 100 tons of fodder on the several sections in addition to supplies collected at stages, and it could be done by using 450, 350, 250 and 550 camels moving from Tehran, Qnm, Kashan and Natanz, respectively, in one or more echelons. A possible rate of movement might thus be— 46th—48th days 3 echelons of 500 men to move from Tehran to occupy Qum, Kashan and Natanz reaching those places on the 52nd, 58th and 63rd day, respectively, to collect supplies for tho march of the remainder. The balance might leave for Isfahan in detachments of 500 men per diem commencing on the 50th day, and, allowing 30 days for Qum-Kashan 5 do. Kashan-Natan'. 4 do. Natanz-Isfahan 7 do. 30 do. 20 do. 50 do.116 the march of each detachment, 12,000 men might be concentrated in Isfahan by 50-f-30+24 = 104th day from the date of orders to mobilize. Ihis might be retarded if the water-supply did not admit of detachments following each other on successive days. In any case it is probable that some 2,000—3,000 men could be pushed through with little previous preparation and reach Isfahan by the 80th day from the date of orders to mobilize. For a prolonged stay at Isfahan it would be necessary to run a line of supply to supple ment local resources, an output of 10 tons daily over 22 marches from Tehran would require some 5,700 camels or equivalant animals using table G as a basis of calculation. 7. An advance from Askhdhdd—V&amp;xt II, paragraph 87. The 2nd Turkistan Army Corps has a strength of 28,000 men and 9,360 animals, and might concentrate at Askhabad by the 20th day of Eussian mobilization [Part II, paragraph 42 (3)]. Though a Russian officer has said it would take 40 days. The number of men which it is estimated could be subsisted at Meshed is 15,000 or roughly half the above number. Before these could advance it would be necessary to stock the road as far as Kuchan (5 stages), from which place to Meshed abundant sup plies are said to be available. Working on the same lines as in Appendix 4, this would mean placing some 350 tons over an average of 3 marches and would take 1,450 five-maund animals or their equivalent 10 days after the animals are placed in position along the route (Table G). Presuming the col'ection of the animals and stocking of the line could be completed during the 20 days neces sary for the concentration of the 1st Turkistan Army Corps at AskJia- bad, Meshed could be occupied by 15,000 men by the 20+15 = 35th day from the date of orders to mobilize. The remainder of the army corps could concentrate at Meshed as soon as a line of supply to supplement local resources had been established. To put 70 tons daily into Meshed from Askhabad 13 stages would require some 16,700 five-maund animals or their equivalent (Table G). Assuming these animals could be collected at railhead and from local resources during the movement of the leading troops the balance of the 2nd Turkistan Army Corps mieht concentrate at Meshed by the 35+15 = 50th day from the date of orders to mobilize. 8 Advance from Meshed to Sistan.—V&amp;rt II, paragraph 89 An advance might be via Turbat-i-Haidari and Biriand (Tart I* paragraph 12, route 19) or Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam and Gazik117 into sections as Stages. 5 12 .. 12 .. 29 and, (1) Meshed-Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam .. .. .. 6 (2) Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam-Gazik .. .. .. 11 (3) Gazik-Nasratabad .. .. .. .. 12 Total .. 29 Supplies are reported to be plentiful on the first section of either route, but would have to be stocked on the remaining sections. A force of 12,000 men and 4,000 animals carrying 9 days' food for men would require supplies at the rate of 10 lbs per man and 120 lbs forage for animals, i.e., some 300 tons on each of the remaining two sections. To place this amount over an average of 6 marches would take 2,700 five-maund animals or their equivalent 10 days after the animals had been placed in position along the route (Table G). A possible rate of movement using only one road might thus be: 35th day from the date of orders to n obilize, detachments of 500 men from leading troops move from Meshed to occupy Turbat-i-Haidari and Birjand reaching those places on the 40th and 55th days, respectively, to collect supplies for the march of the remainder. The sections Turbat-i-Haidari-Blrjand and Birjand-Nasrata- bad might be stocked by the 60th and 75th day, respectively, but the 75th would be considerably below the mark unless suffi cient provisions to stock the Birjand-Nasratabad route are available at Birjand, a very doubtful assumption. Allowing 30 days for the march of columns of 2,000 men a day starting from Turbat-i- Haidarlonthe60thday, t.e.,as soon as the road to Birjand was stocked, a force of 12,000 might be concentrated in Sistan by ^ CO+30+6=86 say 100th day from the date of orders to mobilize. This, however, is an outside calculation and is hardly likely to be attained. 9. Advance on iftrwan.—Part II, paragraph 103. The most direct route from Bandar 'Abbas to Kirman (18 stages) is via Daulatabad (8 stages) and Baft (4 stages). (route 16 idem). These routes maybe divided under— (1) Meshed-Turbat-i-Haidari (2) Turbat-i-Haidaii-Birjand (3) Birjand-Nasratabad .. Total118 Supplies are scarce except at Daulatabad and Baft, where con- Biderable quantities are said to be available. Assuming that 5 days' food for men and forage for animals could be picked up at each of the above two places, 10 days' food for men and an average of 100 lbs forage for animals would have to be stocked or carried for a force advancing. t Taking a brigade as 4,000 men and 1,000 animals advancing in two echelons, each echelon would require 2,000x30+500x100= 110,000fb or = 270 camel loads allowing camels a useful load of 300 lbs only. The leading echelon might thus start from Bandar 'Abbas on the 25th day and, allowing 3 days each at Daulatabad and Baft to collect supplies, reach Kirman on the 25-f 18+6 = 4:9th say 50th day from the date of the order to take up shipping. The 2nd echelon leaving at 2 days' interval would reach Kirman on the 52nd day and the force collected in Kirman by say the 55th day to allow for extra halts. The supply of necessities other than food obtainable in the locality would, on a basis of 15% on the weight of food supplies, amount to some 2,000 maunds a month and could be furnished by weekly convoys of some 100 to 120 camels. 10. An advance on Shlrdz via Flruzabnd. —Part I paragraph 106. The route may be divided into 3 sections viz.— Supplies are scarce except at Firiizabad where large quantities are obtainable and fair amounts are said to exist on the last 2 stages into Shiraz. For the march of a division of 17,000 men and 5,000 animals moving with 7 days' food for men, it would be necessary to stock a depot of 10 days' supplies for men and 150 lbs forage for animals at Ahram and to stock forage at the rate of 60 lb per animal along each of the succeeding sections, i.e., (2) and (3). This would involve placing some 520 tons in Ahram, an operation which would take =1,400 camels working 10 days (Table G) when placed along line of route in position, and to stock forage on the remaining sections would mean placing some 130 tons over an aver- (1) Bushire-Ahram .. (2) Ahram-Kruza bad (3) Firuzabad-Shiraz Stages. 2 4 (6 for troops). 4 do.119 a age of 3 marches on each section. To stock each section would thus take 1,140 camels working 5 days in each section after Ahram and Firiizabad have been stocked sufficient. Assuming then that the depot at Ahram could be stocked under cover of the first troops to land with locally collected transport or by means of camels despatched from India in the leading ships, commencing on the 18th day from the date of taking up shipping, and also that the situation admitted of Firuzabad being occupied by a detachment from the leading brigade, the whole operation of stocking the line might be completed in 18-|-10+6+6=40 days or 45 days allowing for a halt at Firuzabad. The main force would, owing to scarcity of water, have to march in echelons of some 2,000 men and allowing for the first echelon starting from Bushire on the 34th day, i.e., as soon as the line was stocked to Firazabad, the whole division might concentrate at Shirazby the 34+ 14+ 8= 56th day or approximately 2 months from the date of taking up shipping. The supply of a division in food and grain from the base over 14 stages would require |-|x 9,300 = 12,00) camels approxi mately (Table G) but it is doubtful if this Table could be used for long as more forage would be wanted for animals. The supply of necessities other than food obtainable in the locality on the basis of 15% of the weight of food supplies would amount ^to some 200 maunds a day and would require 2oo &gt;&lt;9 300 =1,860 camels working as in Table G. 1 ,000 ' 11. An advance from Shlraz on Isfah In. —Part 11, paragraph 107. Assuming that the opposition encountered allowed of the concentration of a complete division at Shiraz by the 60th day after the order to take up shipping and that the situation admitted of an immediate advance, Deh B d, 110 miles, up to which point abundant supplies are available, might be occupied by the 70th day. Thence to Isfahan 186 miles, 10 stages (probably 12 for troops), the road would require stocking, though considerable sup plies are available at Abadeh, 60 miles and Qu nisheh, 130 miles. Taking 12,000 men and 4,000 animals as the number that could be maintained at Isfahan on local resources after arrival, marching with 7 days'food for men and 3 days'grain for animals, this would mean stocking the road with 5 days' food for men and forage for animals at 120 lbs. to supplement local collection, i.e. 12,000 x 3x5 +4,000x120=300 tons, approximately. To place this over an average of 6 marches, i .e., on the assumption120 that sufficient supplies can be found at Deh B d, would require 2,700 camels, working for 10 days (Table G). Allowing for the requirements of the line of communications, this number might reach Deh Bid, 25 marches from Bushire, in 45+25 say 75 days if opposition was slight. The road towards Isfahan might thus be stocked by the 85th day and Isfahan be reached by the leading detachment about the 100th day. Allowing for detachments of 2,000 men marching on alternate days, concentration at Isfahan would be completed by the 110th day. 12. An advance on Yazd. —Part II, paragiaph 107. Deh Bid to Yazd is 133 miles in 6 stages (8 for troops). The road is passable by all arms but supplies are scanty. For the march of a brigade of all arms, 4,000 men and 1,000 animals, marching with 7 days' food for men, it would be necessary to stock or carry 3 days' food for men and an average of 100 lbs forage for animals, or 3 x 3 X 4 ,000+1,000x 100—136,000 lbs. =60 tons, say 340 camel loads. A brigade with a supply column as above might leave Deh Bid on the 75th day from the date of taking up shipping, vide Appen dix 11, and reach Yazd by the 85th day marching in one or more echelons. As supplies could not be counted on on arrival, the advance could not take place till sufficient transport was available for a regular supply from Deh Bid. Taking the daily require ments of the force in food and grain as 15 tons a day, ^ x 4,450 = 1,950 camels or their equivalent would be required to place this amount in Yazd. If fodder was not available the number would be largely increased.123 Ports oj Southern Persia, 1910-11.
