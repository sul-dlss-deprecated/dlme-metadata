Prideaux, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. to ' r The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India * in the Foreign and Political Department, Simla. Financial Adviser for Bahrain. I have the honour to refer to telegram Ho. 1176-S, dated the 21st September 1925, from the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department in reply to my recommendation that the Shaikh of Bahrain may be allowed to engage an Englishman as Financial Adviser and that the selection of Mr. C. D. Belgrave be approved for the post. 2. At present Shaikh Hamad and the Municipality of Manamah (the chief town of Bahrain) lean very much on the Political Agent fur guidance and assistance in various questions, which strictly speaking are internal matters though they also affect the comfort of the foreign populat- -ion residing in Bahrain. In consequence, Major Daly, in spite of his intimate knowledge of the Arabic language and of local affairs, is very much over-worked. I do not expect that any Political Agent succeeding him will be able to do as much for the State as he has done. 3. The Government of India are now, I believe, un- -willing to give the Political Agent a gazetted Assistant and from their telegram Mo. 142-H, dated the 1st October 1925,2 1925, it appears that an insuperable difficulty has occurr- -ed in the matter of the deputation of a Revenue Officer to the islands to carry out the Land Revenue Settlement. I With the appointment of Mr. Belgrave I think that all need for these two officers will cease. ' ■ i ' . ■ ... 4. Mr. Belgrave, who will work as Personal Assistant to Shaikh Hamad and Supervisor in all administrative matt- -ers, will have the benefit of Major Daly's experience and advice at first. When this Political Agent leaves the State, the Financial Adviser will, I feel sure, he able to stand entirely on his own feet. 5. In Muscat it has been found necessary to find for the Ruler an English Administrator to rescue the Sultanate [ from a state of insolvency. In Bahrain the necessity arises from a totally different cause. 6. Ihe revenues of the State are greater thafi the Chief and his Arab advisers can judiciouily spend. It is recognised that the income is likely to expand and that the growing community of Europeans, Americans and educated Arabs., Persian and I„d 1 an s are entitled to expect their condition of life to be improved. ' • i) j If anything comes of the competition between different Companies for an oil concession there may be a * ^ b HB b large and new influx of Europeans and their followers in the near future. 7. Shaikh Hamad in conversation has evinced to me his apprehension as to how his Administration will fare after % the departure of Major Daly. • Later on, he informed me through the Political Agent that he thought that the intro- | -duction of an officer like Mr. Thomas of Muscat would be t the most satisfactory solution. 8r I should mention here that Mr. de Greniere, the Director of Customs, is not a suitable man for the post. HeHe is not personal grata with Shaikh. Hamad, partly 'because he has made little effort to acquire pro- -ficiency in the Arabic language and partly 'because he is addicted to proposing extravagant schemes, while at the same time he is a poor supervisor of expenditure. His i engagement will probably be terminated at the end of 3 years, and it is believed that it will then be possible to engage a successor in the Customs Department more cheaply. 9. Sifter examining the contracts made with Mr. de Greniere and Captain Thomas (of Muscat), I find it necessary to recommend a higher rate of salary than I had proposed in London as I do not think that Mr. Belgrave's remuneration , r should be less than jfetesi Mr. de Greniere ! s. To a certain extent the Financial Adviser and Personal Assistant to Shaikh Hamad will be the Customs Director*8 superior officer. 10. I therefore propose for Mr. Belgrave the follow- -ing terms :- ■PayI Ss. 1000 — 50 *— 2200. Out of this Ss. 200/- p.m. will be put into a Provident Pund opened in the Eastern Bank, Ltd. | is . | ^ ill Period of engagement: Terminable on three months' notice. fil Quarters: Free, or Ss. 100/- p.m. in lieu. •&gt; I Furlough: If months p.a. on full pay or 3 months on half pay, earned aftei 4 years' service. 1 Leave: i month p.a. in India. 'assages: 1 free 1st class on appointment and completion of service, also ; 1 on furlough to England and on leave to India. 11. I trust that these proposals will meet with the i approval of the Government of India. I shall be grateful if I may be informed by telegraph of their orders, in order that I may conmunicate the same to Mr. Belgrave as quickly # as possible. 1 have the honour to be, , .

It has not been conside'red necessary to insert a clause forbidding Mr. Bolgrave to engage in trade, but you should infoism him {and report accordingly) that of course this will not be allowed. 4. Mention has been made of passage concessions for Mr. Belgrave and his family. It is considered desirable not to fix a definite sum of money in lieu of the actual cost of the tickets, as there would seem to be a balance of advantage • against so doing, and it is not the practice in India at present 5. The Political Resident considers that, if Mr. Belgraw has to submit any monetary claim against the State, e.g. for passage allowance, it will be desirable for him to first obtain the Political Agent's counter-signature to the claim before presentation to the State'for payment.

From these it would appear that the pay is i. to he Rs 1000 &amp; in addition Rs 200 in the provident jJund^ —— y p &gt;| tut on referring to Resident's letter Ho 378-S of 10th Oct. to the Governmnet of India it would appear that the Rb200 is included in the total of Rs 1000.

Heither of these officers have anything like the amount of work tuxata which Mr Belgrave has to perform nor have they so much responsibility k in the case of Geake there is some years difference in age 0 Shaika Hamad would not be averse to paying Mr Helgrave at the rate of Rs 1000 plus Rs 200 provident fund,if approved lc in view of the fact that the future Director of Customs,if recruited from India will probably have to be paid at least RsIOOO pluspensioji contribution, &amp; that ilt is essentiel that Mr Belgrave should be regarded as the senioir officer in the employment of the State, perhaps the Hon'ble the Re^iident will approve of Mr Belgrace 's pay commencing at Rs 1000 plus Rs v^OO. In this case howc/er,! wou.Ld suggest that increments should not commence until the examination in Arabic by the Higher Standard ha»t5 been passedo Para V (C) It is not quite realised \ hat the term 'personal' pay is meant to convey .Should this no't be 'average' pay based on the . average of the preceding 12 months?.

It is regretted that through inadyertance the initial rate of pay was set cat as Es 1000-0-0 plus £s 200-0-0 per mensem. T.' , ' \ This has now been corrected. As the Goyernment of India have sanctioned the rate of S3 800-0-0 plus Is 200-0-0 per mensem, the Hobble the Political Resident regrets that it cannot be alter ed now, 3.

Colonel Prideaux regrets that he cannot permit Mr. Belgrave to accumulate his privilege leave to the extent.sug gested by you. The intention underlying the grant of one month's leave each year was that the officer should retain Ms health by taking leave each year to ensure his getting a change of air and climate. The Political Resident is, however, pre - * A ^ pared to allow Kr. Belgrave to accumulate such leave up to two months, to enable him to spend it in the Lebanons, If he so wishes. He cannot agree to it being taken with furlough, and wished me to point out that this is contrary to the Indian leave rules, for, when leave on average pay was introduced, privilege leave was abolished. 6.

It may.be asked why we should not allow Bahrain to be run as, for instance Kuwait is, as an ■,rab city on arab lines. The answer is th-:.,t the population of the two cities is wholly uissimil&lt;ii • The population of Kuwait is largely Bedouins their outlook is towards and of the desert, come and shop there sre the desert Arabs the int^i ior Kuwait commanded till recently the pick ox tisO ledosin tribes, the Ajman and fcutalr, end all their wealth and trade came rrom tramc with the intex ior and 1x^0* their flocks and herds.

The population of Bahrain is het^*ogeneous and divided W racial and religious differences i-gdis 'i/ahablSf i-erslans, J-unnis, '.hiahs and large colonies of 1.ohammedsn and Hindu Indians.

The Question whether should ' oe replaeea 'by another European or not will be aonsidared then, li.

I think this arr. n^.smont would be satisfactory, ana mi^ht be given etfect to irrespective of the arrival or non- •arrival or the oil company, and X trust the riovsrnment of India will be pleased to approve of it. |lj 12. Finally, as pointed out by •'.o Ion el Barrett, jx. ue oreniar's functions are purely administrative, ana not politicals he has no hand in any matter that affects the dail^ lives of the people, and owing to the fact that the Bahrain revenue consists almost i MtidOEStjF exclusively of the customs receipts, any fall- •ing off under this head is a much more serious natter than would ha s aeerease under one head in a mors normal budget* His itlllff are almost exclusively with the coaaierolal classes, shipping 00mpanics etc. and not with toe mass of the people. As Colonel Ba.. xett asked, why replace a foreigner who has proved his efficiency by a less efficient foreigner, which is what the repl^ceisent of Ir. ae 'renier by an Egyptian, ■yrisn or Iraki would mean. I nay mention that mxxx;,r. ch3 aranier Is on an Indefinite contract terislnaole by 3 nonthu notice un @ititer tiftam', so there will toe no aiiTieulty in dispensing with his services should tUis at any time ne aonsiderea desira'ole. io. ro sunt up, 1 ao not think it will toe possible to uispense with i-ue services of Mr* Beigrave within any time tliat need toe taken into consiueiation at present. Ae ytgifla the ijolioe, Mr. Parke will protoaoly resign in a year or two, and the question of hi© successor can toe taken up then; it depends to a great extent on whether oil is found in Bahrain or not. I can while however 3 reeojamend Uut steps should toe taken uo replace the ;ndian police toy Soudanes® next year, and request the approval of the Oovernaent of India to this.

Thereafter the contract is renewable by mutual consent'. I confess I do not understand the meaning of this phraseology and it seems to me a contradiction in terms. I understand that a similar formula is adopted in the case of contracts entered into by some commercial firms with their employes, but in s^ch cases it has reference primarily to the rate of pay to be drawn by the employe during the three or four years, as the atase may / be, of his service. /t the end of that period the employe can ask for better terms if he likes. In the case of the Bahrain employes however their pay is fixed on a time-scale extending over a long period of years and the phraseology adop- ted in the first clause would seem to be inapplicable. I asked Mr.Belgrave what he understood by this, ana he admitted that it was quite ambiguous. I would therefore suggest that the contracts of both Messrs.Parke and Belgrave should be amended on the model of Mr.de Grenier's contract and that they should be given indefinite contracts terminable at three months' notice on either side. Mr.Belgrave informed me that he would ksc have no objection to this. This would enable-the case of . Captain it • • • •V Captain -arke to be suitably dealt with and he could retire w when he wished to do so on givirg a suitable notice, while the State on their side would also be at liberty to dispense with his services when no longer required. It is, I consider, essential that Mr,Parke should remain on till tine ehd of next summer at any rate as Mr«Belgrave is due for leave and Mr,Parke will act for him. officer but recently arrived would find auch difficulty in filling the combined appointments of Adviser and Commandant of the police, 4, To sum up: I recommend that the contracts of Messrs.i^elgrave and Parke should be amended and that they should be engaged for an indefinite period subject to three months' notice on either side as in the case of Mr.de Grenier and that the services of Captain Parke should be retained at any rate for one year.■r. \ \ \ EXPRESS LETTER.

Sir, x x x x x x x x x x x x x 3, The two measures of economy are the reduction of the appointment of Captain Parke and the substitution of local men for the fifty remaining Indian Police. Captain Parke costs the State some Rs,14,000/- per annum and local men could be secured for Rs.25/- per mensem as compared with the Rs.35/- now paid to the Indian Police thereby resulting in an annual saving of Hb .6,000/- apart from a considerable sum now expended on passages and leave pay. x X x X x XX X X x x x X 5. Another economy that was considered was a cut in salaries over a certain amount, but, since a 5% cut would onl^ produce a saving of some Rs.500/- a month this is not being put into force at the moment, though ii vvill be necessary ^.atcr if conditions do not improve, 1 consider that the proposals are practical and I recomtaend their adoption. Captain Parke has little to do save ' durins the six months in every third year that he acts for Mr. ^el grave, and he does not seem able uo gi ^e .iir. j c -I jsj - d.v&amp; as much assistance as one might have expected during the remainder of the time. His contract expires after the conclusion of his leaveleave in September this year and it is proposed that his contract should simply not be renewed. His administration of the Indian Police has not impressed me and I consider that the State can do very well without his services until Mr, Belgrave goes on leave in 1934. ' By that time the recreation or retention of the post of Assistant Adviser could be reconsidered and the answer would probably be found in the state of the pearl market, which the real ruler of Bahrain. 7. I heartily recommend the early disbandment of the Indian Police whose contracts expire during the summer of this year, xxx x xxx xx x x x x x 10. One point requires mention. Eo immediate economy will result from the reduction of Captain Parke's post or the substitution of local men for Indians since the former will receive full* pay till September and there will be a time when both local men and Indians will have to be paid since the recruits will take time to train. The ultimate economy, however, is obvious. I request, therefore, that these two proposals and the request for permission to levy enhanced customs dues be referred to the Government 'of India, with your approval for an early decision. The leity of zakat requires no refere nce, but His Excellency will probably expect a word from you before putting i i/ into force. \ ' I have the honour to be, o X X ^ Your most obedient servant, sd/-C.G.Prior, Political Agent,Bahrain.Extract from Deapatcfe No.G,? of 22nd January J.332 to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India. • • • ^ I I I have the honour to invite a reference to ^xajor Fowle s letter No.1449,dated 11th July 1932, regarding the finances of the Bahrain State. xx x x x X ^ X x x x x x XX X x x X X X 3. Finally four measures were proposed, which it was hoped would meet the immediate necessities of the situation, and Mr.Belgrave said he would submit them for consideration to the Deputy Ruler. These measures were as follows*. (a) that on the expiration of his present contract in September next, the services of Captain Parke should not be renewed and that the Adviser should hold charge of the police in addition to his own duties for a year at any rate as he has done when Captain Parke has been on leave. x x X , X ■» x A ■v- X ■ ■ X x X X x x X X X X X X X X 5. A S regards the reduction of the appointment of Commandant of Police, I would invite a reference to the correspondence ending with Foreign and Political Jepartment letter H0.JM64-H/89. dated 19th January 1931, in which the approval of the Government of India was accorded to tne retention of Captain Parke for a further period of at least one year. Captain Parke has, I know, been looking about for an appointment outside Bahrain for some time past but informedj \ informed me that he would, in any event, stay over tJrie summer, when he was acting for Mr. 3elgrave,who was on leave. He himself is proceeding on leave in the spring and his contract expires in September, and having regard to the need for economy 1 agree with the Political Agent's proposal that it should not be xbhws renewed and that the post should, for the time be.ng, be left vacant. Mr. Belgrave has twice, for a period of six months on each occasion, held charge of the Police in addition to his own work and informs me that he can do so in future, though possibly there may be some slight loss of efficiency. In view of the necessity for economy, however, this must be faced. ihe difficulty will arise two years hence when Mr.Selgrave goes on leave. It has been customary in the past for Captain Parke to act for him and it is essential to have someone in Bahrain who can perform the duties of the Adviser during Mr. .oelgrave *&gt; absence. In any case, however, I think the post of Commandant of Police may be left vacant for a year and a half and the question of appointi ng J some other officer ssfe to it can oe re considered in the autumn Ox 1933. 6. As mentioned in ray telegram lo.T.21,dated 21st January 1932, the Bahrain Government have already informed Captain Parke that it is not their intention to extend his contract. It was explained to me that they had done this, as after the question has been discussed with Shaikh hamad, they thought it better to let Captain Parke know without delay, as the matter would certainly have got round to him from private sources. X X X X X X X X X X 11. It is anticipated that these proposals in a full year would produce about Rs.43,000, made up as follows; ^ 14,000.

I replied that 1 certainly agreed with him/but suggested that it should take effect after Parke had definitely left the State service sometime in September,since it could hardly he said to he an economy to the State if Parke was on leave on full pay, and Belgrave at the sametime received an officiating allowance. 2. Sir Hugh agreed with this and said that he thought Rs.200 per month would he a suitable amount. The matter was not mentioned to Shaikh Hamad as the 't Government of India had not then expressed their concurrence with the proposal to reduce the appoint ment, but I think,,if you agree with Sir Hugh's view, it might be done now. The duties of Commandant of Police are not very heavy but they form a serious addition to Belgrave's duties which,in themselves, are a whole time Job. I may say that he has shown great interest in his Police duties and has been extremely successful in the detection of araq cases which before passed unnoticed. If you approve I will mention the matter to Shaikh Hamad,who,I feel certain,will agree^and then tell Belgrave that he could pay himself this allowance from the da# that Parke left the State service.Ill I I HI I II II tin in Hi I II I ilil p2. 2.

In accordance with the proposal put forward in para graph 5 of Sir Hugh Mscoe's letter Mo. C-7, dated 22nd January 1932, to the Government of India, Mr. Belgrave, Financial Adviser, Bahrain, has since held charge of the appointment of Officer Commanding, Bahrain Armed .Police, in addition to his own duties. Sir Hugh Biscoe was of opinion that Mr. Belgrave should receive an allowance of Hs. 200 per mensem for this add it i anal duty 'but decided in the interests of economy that such allowance should not take effect until the expiry of the leave due to Captain Parke. For this reason/«H» 2 reason and as the Government of India had not then accorded their approval to the proposal to terminate Captain l^arke • s services the matter was not mentioned to the Shaikh of Bahrain* I recommend that I should now advise Shaikh Mamad to grant Mr, Pelgrave, with effect from the date of expiry of Captain Parke's leave, an allowai.-ce of Hs* 200 per mensem for hold ing additional change of the appointment of Officer Command ing, Bahrain Armed Police. i*he duties of Officer Commanding, Bahrain Armed Police, add appreciably to Mr. Belgrave's work and responsibilities.

Mr.Belgrave has no particular feeling on the subject and agrees with me that it would be unwise to suggest any such alteration at the present moment.

A,. Political Agent.Bahrain. It may seem rather premature but I think it is almost f time to consider what arrangements are to be made for a substitute for myself when I go on leave in the summer of 1934; I ■ I shall be taking six months leave,probably from April or thereabouts. Before this year there has been no difficulty as Captain Parke who was Assistant Adviser and Police Officer used to act for me during my absence,but now we have no Police Officer and I do not consider that de Grenier is qualified to cope with my work, When the matter was originally discussed it was hoped that by 1934 financial conditions would have improved sufficiently for the State to engage another Police Officer who would also do Court work and act for me when I was away. This at present cannot be afforded though it is Just possible that if the Oil Company begin making payments we might be more prosperous in a year's time. The other suggestion is that we should obtain the services of some one for six months,but if this were done it would be necessary for the man to be here for several months beforehand in order to get acquainted with the work, de Grenier is due to go on leave this summer but Steele is also due for leave in 1934 so a temporary substitute will have to be found for him,this I hope to be able to arrange with Callenders. Unfortunately all this will cost money so 1934 will be an expensive year for the State. This suwmer while de Grenier is away I shall do his work as well as my own and the Police work, I iiave acted be i ore as Customs Director in addition to my ordinary work but I have not before done the three jobs at once. It is a great deal (2)//J 2. more than one person can do,especially in the su^er.but for financial reasons it is inevitable and I fully appreciate this. At present,owing to lack of money we are doing no special wrok such as land survey,public works,agriculture etc. I cannot afford the necessary time for the work which I should deal with both as Adviser and Police Officer. I deal with the Police before breakfast and they really require much more attention tnan that,three whole mornings every week are taken up oy tie Court,and the amount of litigation seems to increase yearly,another morning every week is taken up by Municipal meetings and a whole morning every fortnight by affairs of the Waqf department and at present I do not feel that these various institutions can carry on properly without my attending to tnem. This leaves me one or two mornings every week for other work. I am stating these facts not as a complaint but a some indication of what the person who acts for me will have to do. Would it be possible to borrow anyone from the Political Department or the Consular Service? It is essential that he should be able to speak Arabic and that he should have had some experience of this kind of work. The disadvantage of this suggestion is that some people would undoubtedly insinuate that a Government of India official had been introduced into the State for political reasons. I believe that the brother of Captain A1ban,who is now in Muscat as Adviser,is going to act as Adviser there for six months. He was previously in the 'Iraq Government service. I do not know him personally but perhaps it might be possible to employ him in a similar capacity in Bahrain. Failing this it will be necessary to obtain some one from outside and should this have to be done it will take time to find a suitable man who would take on the job. It might be as (3)Hh 3, well to look for a man wiio would be suitable as a permanent Police Officer if in the future the State could afford such a 4 post.if this was under consideration I know a young man,who is r now witn the .A.P.O.G who might possibly be suitable but he would not leave Ms present work for an eight month's job. Although it seems ratner too soon to consider the matter I know that these matters take a long time to arrange so perhaps it would be as well to obtain the views of the Resident on the subject.Confidential. p.O.Wo. of 1933.

D.0.NO:C/22-6/1 I A flrK / hi- tv \ t ; jfi$&amp;i -n T • i - ~ roiitical Ageacy, Bahrain,the 16th January 1934. ; Mr.C •D.Belgraye,Adviser to the Bahrain Groverxuaent, proposes to apply to His Excellency Shaikh Hamad bin f Isa Al Khali 1 ah tor leave lor seven Months irom the beginning of April to October 1934. 2. I consider that it is essential that Mr.Belgrave should get away for a spell of leave. His work for the State is worthy of the highest admiration, but he has been greatly overworked,especially during the past two years,owing to the fact that he has held the post of Commandant of Police in addition to his own duties. It is very much in our interests that he should have leave in order to preserve his health,for we should find it hard to obtain another Officer with his qualities and qualifications for the post. 3. A copy is enclosed of a demi-official letter No:C/l09 dated the 16th December 1933,in which Mr.Belgrave,at my request, has made suggestions for dealing with the work during his absence. 4. The appointment of a substitute,or of a Commandant of Police,who could also temporarily take charge of the post of Adviser,is impossible at present owing to the financial stringency 0. The essential points in Mr.Belgrave ! s proposals may be sumiaarized as follows Finance . The budget of 1353 will be prepared by Mr.Belgrave and be approved by His Excellency Shaikh Hamad before Mr.Belgrave leaves. Payments will be made strictly according to the budget and will oe supervised by Mr.cle Grenier (the Director of Customs), /whony I f 2. who will Have orders to report to the Political Agent should any difficulty arise. I agree that accounts siiould be sent to the Political Agent monthly. Law and Order. The Police will be under the direct orders of His Excellency Shaikh Hamad, but the work will be done by the Police Officer,Haji Salman,and the Political Agent will keep a close watch on the Force. Jail will be under the Police Ofiicer and arrangements will be made for the Medical Ofiicer-in-charge, Victoria Memorial Hospital to visit it at regular intervals. Land Registration D epartment . The Supervisor of the Land Department will hold charge and will have orders to report to the Political Agent in case of any attempt to evade the land regul ations, especially by Members of the Ruling Family. Municipalities. The Presidents (who are brothers of Eis Excellency Shaikh Hamad) will be in charge of the Municipalities, iiie Political Agent,who himself sits with them from time to time, will keep a watch on important matters. Education. Shaikh * Abdullah bin Usa Al Khalifah is in charge of the Department,but the Inspector of Education will do the practical work,and the Political Agent will watch matters. Judicial. Shaikh Salman should be ^uite capable of carrying on the work of the Bahrain Court (the senior State Court),but I agree that a younger relative should sit with him. The opportunity m is an admirable one to test Shaikh Salman with a view to his doing the work in future without the Adviser to help him. He will be given an increase in pay for his increased responsibilities (which will incidentally be an excellent way of settling certain ^Uculties over his present allowances,into which I need not go here). Perhaps I should add that the Political Agent (or a ^oint Court of the Political Agent and His Excellency Shaikh Hamad) /hashas jurisdiction in cases in which British subjects and Foreigners are concerned. Customs. Mr. de Grenier is well able to deal with Customs matters and is in close touch with the Political Agent. 6. I would emphasise tiiat the Political Agent will not interiere openly in any matter,if it can be avoided,but will keep in close touch behind the scenes. There will no doubt be some &lt; ' . ■ ' . ' ,. ; j 7 - tailing oil* in what we call eiiiciency,but we gain an opportunity of letting the Ruling Family show their capabilities,and so of enabling us,I hope,in the luture to delegate to them some of the work of the much overworked Adviser. Even if they prove ineiiicient,the time will not be long enough for,I trust,any real derangement of the administration. It will be seen that the financial arrangements are so made that no attempt can be made to spend money,other th«m the usual monthly salaries and other fixed payments,without inform ation of it coming to the knowledge of the Political Agent. A most important point is that contained in the ninth paragraph of Mr.Belgrave's letter,that is to say,that in the case of important matters,financial,oil or political,His Excellency Shaikh Hamad should be asked to discuss the question at issue with his brothers,Shaikhs Muhammad and f Abdullah,and his son. Shaikh Salman. This is already done in practice to a large extent,and to do so as regular procedure during this period would tend to place on a recognised basis an existing general practice, and so gradually to provide the State with a kind of Executive Council of their own design. 8. His Excellency Shaikh Hamad must,I think,manage his Qwn private money affairs himself (unless he asks Mr.de Grenier 'to help him),and I will endeavour to see that he does not embark on any expensive project such as building mosques. /9.9. la tkecircumstances I trust that there is no objection to His Excellency Shaikh fiaaad granting to Mr.BelgraYe,the leave ior which he asks and which he certainly requires. I would ask for early orders as Mr.Belgrave has not yet approached His Excellency Shaikh Hamad,who is,however,unlikely to raise any objection. lonourable jieut-Colpnel T.G.W,Fowle,C.B.E Political Eesident in'the*Persian Gulf Bushire.I vi BAiiMII.

To:- The Eonourahle the Political Resident' in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Subject:- Appointment of an assistant to trie Adviser to the Bahrain Government. overnment. Sir, I have the honour to recommend the appointment of an Assistant to the Adviser to the Bahrain Government. 2. The Adviser has much more work than can be periormed by one man. 5 very endeavour has been made to delegate nis work to members of the Ruling Family and otriers, cut owing to lacii of education there is no one who can undertake a great part uf the Adviser 1 s duties, which include complicated work connected with, for example, oil and air developments and can only be carried out by a man oi education aijd trainc'C- intt;±iigenct. xt is well to remember that Bahrain has sprung in tne last decade from complete obscurity and almost bedouin rule to a u^te administered on modern, if Arab, lines, and the Ici^t tiir ^e years have seen an oil field come into being with all the changes and difficulties which that implies. Protection, control of foreign affairs and jurisdiction over fvieigncrs is in our hands and it is essential to our position tn^t the administration should be properly conduceed. 3. Gome two years ago it was found necessary, for financial reasons, to dispense with the services of the Commandant of PoJ.ice and to add responbiuility ior the train ■ /ingmg an-. aaj:M,nistration of the Bahrain ^rmea Police and of the body of iJaturs (armed watchmen) to the duties performed hy the AaTiser. iks ^resect Adviser has done the duties well (and has been able to do them owing to his long experience of Bahrain; |Xi-!t •l.-y „ voiialacracle ourden to an already overworked post. It is, moreover, inevitable that the work of the Adviser jnould continue to increase owing to the opening up of Banrain, to increased means of communication, to the development of an oil field, and to the fact that other neirhbourinp' G -overn- o ments ('Iraq., Najo and Persia) have adopted to a greater or less g„l . c wustenn metnods in conducting their affairs* 5. m r* iielgrave, the present Adviser, has been gravely pverwoi..ed, anu one grant of tne leave, which he is now enjoying/ was essential to preserve his health } otherwise I should have been loatn to agree to the temporary arrangement^ that have been made, ^n Assistant is required not only to relieve the Adviser of work, but also to ensure continuity in the absence of the Adviser on leave, which must be given fairly frequently in the climatic and otherwise trying conditions of Bahrain. 6. I would emphasise that the proposed appointment does not signify any desire to westernise Bahrain. On the contrary, though some' years ago we were compelled to interfere drastically ai id to introduce widespread reforms, every endeavour has been ®ade to create an administrative machine suited to and worked by the Polling Family and their people. For example, a kind of Executive Council of the Al Phalifah is gradually coming into ' e ing and local men are employed so far as it is possible to do 20 in all branches of the administration. 7. The possibility of employing an Arab as .assistant to the Adviser has been considered, but there is no local man suit- s-hle for the appointment and it would be most unwise to employ /an/II. '5 an .rab from Syria or elsewhere, as his appointment would arouse a restntnici! b w-dou wo ma not ce felt in the case of a British Assi-^ an uo ao so would be politically imprudent because of the special interests which we have in Bahrain. 8. xhe more important of the terms proposed for the appointment are:- ~n r'' X ay- Rs.800-50-2,000. Irovident Fund. Es.200/- a month. Accommodation. A free furnished house,or an allowance of Bs.100/- a month in lieu thereof. Passages. Free passage to the United Kingdom afTer every 2i years T service at the rate of a second class passage by the Overland Route. Medical Attendance. At State expense JL. termination. Three months' notice on either side. A copy is enclosed of a draft agreement embodying the above terms and the other conditions of the proposed appointment. (h' 33 It is based on those executed by the Adviser, the director of Customs and Port Officer and the late Commandant of Police. 9. It is not easy to fill a post of this kind, for which special qualities are needed, but it is proposed oitering the — imiwi if &gt; i -iifn-i-Ti -nTir- -rfif-m- ■ v --i-, , ^ ^ ^ ^ i fK umtrnmOTtm; appointment to Mr. J.M.Luard, who is at present working for ■ &lt;' ' 1 ***** mm ■ the Anglo-Persian Oil Company Limited in Tehran. Mr. Luard is recommended by the present adviser and has been well spoken o± by members of the Legation in Tehran, from whom fuller enquiries ^ I) ^ are bein^ made, it is understood that Mr. Luaru wouxa ue 1 o willing to consider the offer if it is made. I would add that ais knowledge of oil practice would oe oi great 'value to die Bahrain Government. 10. There is no question of any difficulty over the financial side of the appointment, so long as the oil field continues in commercial production.4. li. before ne went on leave, the adviser consulted His iixcej-i^i -y o-iaikh Iiamad bin ? Isa Al Shallfah informally and Ttrballj' v-.';c x unaerstand that he (the uhaikh) fully agreed Assistant to tne Adviser was necessary, 'but X have thought 10 |.aelerao±e to ascertain your wishes before makina* 1 '' O any formal enquiries from the Shaikh. 1 have the honour to he Sir, lour most obedient servant.

He was only here a day or two and was very 'busy all the time otherwise he would have written himself. I do hope that Thhran report favourably on Luard. We are leaving London on the 9th for my fatherGineiaw 1 s^house in Norfolk, Horsford Manor, near Norwich will be my address until we start for Bahrain obl 26th September, but we are staying a few days at Montreux en route# After a fortnight in Norfolk we are going up to ocotlana, to stay with the Wingates and then to Edinburgh, I wonder whether Mrs Loch would be feeling well enough to see us. We were so very sorry to hear no how ill she had been and we do so hope she is getting on well now. We have had a very good time in London and have been very gay but now most of our friends and relations have left town so we shall ^be glad of a change in the country. James is very well, we are sending him out bv sea with the nurse on the same ooat as Mrs xiolmes d)S going by. I hope you have good news of Tarn. I dont like to tother Mrs Looh with a letter so ooald you possibly drop me a line just to say if you think she would care to see us in which case my wife will write to her.

I have had a talk with Colonel Powle with these two letters ■before us, he understands that you wrote to the Legation in Tehran to get an opinion on Luard, no reply however had 'been received from the Legation before Colonel Powle left Bushire. He will approach Laithwaite and ask him to wire you whether the Legation have replied, he will also ask Laithwaite to keep me informed. Provided the Legatio give Luard a good chit Colonel Powle, as far as he is concerned, is ag reahle to Luard 'being appointed and is of the opinion that probably the 'best course' would then be for me to approach Luard personally and confidentially informing him of the terms and asking him if he is willi to take them. If he is not willing we will have to think again. If he iji does accept them I will inform you and in that event Colonel Powle thin' that the best procedure would be for you to approach the A. P.0.C. in London through the India Office. H / V* With regard to Para 8 of your letter Wo C/6I8 Colonel Powle thinks that some difference might be made in pay, which as suggested in your letter is the same as for myself. He says that the pay of an Assistant is normally less than that of his superior. He thinks that while the iniative pay and the yearly increments might reasonably be the same as suggested the Maximum might be somewhat less, say Rs 1600 instead of Rs 2000. As far as I am concerned I agree to this. If by any chance Luard wanted a larger Maximum than Rs 1600 the point can be considered of raising this. 4. | Colonel Powle has no remarks to make about Provident Fund, Accomodation, Medical Attendance or Termination. 5. Passages. Your proposal is ' Free passage to the United Kingdom after every 2^ years service at the rate of 2nd Class passage by Overland Route.' My own terms under this heading are 1st Class P &amp; 0.B rate every four years. Colonel Powle points out tnat in Government service passages are normally the same for all ofiicers, whether junior or senior and he thinks it might be more logical xor the Assistant to have the same passage terms aiici concesoions as o/ie Adviser. He would like to leave this suggestion uo be followeu. up in detail between you and myself. 6. Colonel Powle says he would have written to you cixrect but he'l* ;V is just off to Ireland.

Officiating Political Agent, ^brt^ Bahrain. i m ^ • 10 • - The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Leave and passage concessions for officers of the Bahrain State. Sir, I have the honour to refer to letter ^ T o:F.30S-N/54 dated the 8th August 1934 from the Deputy Secretary to the Government of India in the -foreign and Political •department and fco say that before a revision of Mr. de Grenier's contract can be undertaken his consent will have to be obtained and it is likely that he will refuse to agree to a contract renewable every four years. Also he has, I believe, seven or eight months leave on average pay accunulated and he my want compensation for this. 1 / g || 2. Under Mr. Belgrave ! s agreement he is at present n entitled to roughly four months leave on average pay everj?- twenty months, though the terms of his contract allow him to take the leave due to him annually or to accumulate it. He ;ets a first class return passage to the United kingdom after four years active service for himself and his family. He gets also annual return passages to Karachi for himself only and these last can be accumulated. 3. From the Government of India's letter it is not sraite /clearp clear whether a definite allowance of fn.-. 6 OA ■ ; 0ur montns after every tx-venty months active service is to be gr-ntpri • ■ S^B-nued inclusive of or excj.usive of privile 0 '^ ip-.-vrr-* , leave, also as to whether the air passage .entioned refers to an air passage to Karachi or to the amted Mngdom; and also whether passages for the employee family to the Dnlted Kingdom should be given every twenty months. return cir pcioSd-e to the United ^ingdom would involve very heavy expenditure as it would also have to include the cost of transit of luggage by sea. As the cost of air travel to Karachi is not very much greater than that of a passage by sea, it might be possible to get the Bahrain Government to agree to pay the cost of this passage with or without an allowance for luggage. I think that the present arrangement regarding a sea passage to the U n ited kingdom after every four years might be left as it is. 5. In many ways it would be better if all contracts for European enployees of the Bahrain Government were drawn up on similar lines. . - I have the honour to be Sir, Your obedient servant.

British Consulate-General, BTJSHTRE. Dated 231(1 November 1934 Eeference to previous correspondence : Description o Name and Date. Tehran telegram No.118 of 31st October 1934. Subject. Appointment of Mr.J.M. Luard as Assistant to the Adviser to the Bahrain Goverrment.^5 IX S~ 3 • - -f- I n !5 /i - // yn Application of Mr Belgr&amp;ve for amendment of his contract. C &gt; Mr-. Belgrave prefers tv?o requests. (1) That the intitial periou of service without furlough be reaucea from lour years to two. (2] That the passage money for his annual recess to India be cumu lative and employable to cover the cost of passages home when the four- yearly free fare is not admissible. 2. Mr Belgrave is correct in say ing that his contract was framed witK- the intention of giving similar con-d^^*™* to those under which an officer in Superior Government service serves, but in/certain respects his contract 1 gives him more favourable rates 2. In framing Belsrave's con tract the limits of the amount of leave on average pay to which Govt, servants are subject were not impo sed. With us the period of leave an officer may take on average salary is subject to a maximum of l/llth of the period served plus one year. In othe -r 1 v/ords, while in 22 years service Mr 1 Bel grave may take 4 years and ,7 raontKs leave on full pay, a Govt servant is limited to 3 years. Even if recess be disregarded he is still able to take 32 months on full pay, but as the recess is cumulative it is to all intents and purposes leave. 4. On the other hand certain provisions in his contract have not had the result anticipatecu It was 6 Hlt 2 - ■ thought that he would be able to recess each yesj.r and bo preserve his health, but a moment's reflection shows that with, the possible exception of Shiraz, he can not reach a hill station in less than 7 days, or if he go to India 10. He would be obliged to spend at least a fortnight out of his month in traversing Iraq or India in the hottest part of the year. 5 . It i s t he ref ore o bv i ous that i t will only pay him to accumulate his re cess ana go home to England on it. He has no friends in India, and the Lebanon \ is halfway to England. His request that the amounts which would have been payable, for his fares to India on recess should be payable towards a fare to England, { He is at present only entitled to a fare every 4 years ) when viewed in this light appears reasonable and will not cost the Bahrein State any greater sura than they are already liable for. 6. The 4years period before furlough might be taken in the first instance was imposed by Col. Prideaux with the idea that he should be thoroughly grounded in his work before going home, on the • analogy of a Govt, servant coming to the East for the first time. Mr Belgrave's case is however entirely different. He ✓ has already served some 11 years in the East, is qualified in the language ana was actually employed in an administra tive Govt, service before coming here. 7. It is also possible that Col.Pri deaux h»d in mind the long periods he served in the Gulf without leave at thePage 3. / joo (y outset of his career. It Is, I think, now generally admitted that that such long periods v/ithout leave are a mistake, and that smaller and more frequent spells are more beneficial than longer ones separated by wider intervals. Mr Belgrave aoes not appear very robust ana an insistence on this four year period would probably have the result of destroying his health at the commencement of his service. As he himself has saia, his value to the State depends very largely on the continuity of his service. 8. The conditions of his service are more arduous than those of the ordinary appointment in India, for the insalubrious climate of the Persian lulf is proverbial and Government servants receive special allowances to compensate them for service in it. 9. As the original contract was sub mitted to the G. of I. for approval, it would appear that the amendment of it should also receive their sanction. As Mr Belgrave does not ask for more leave and his proposal does not cause any great er expense to the state than was original ly provided' for, but only ssks for a redis tribution of his leave in the first four I . j W *• - m ■ -i years, I think that G.of I.would un- I doubtedly accept the alteration.askea for 10. A point which undoubtedly will a- rise, but which has not hitherto been con s idered is whether journey time will be added to to the 1 month's recess or It months furlough. As the contract was fra med on the Fundamental rules, and as Govtservants are only allowed, such time in \ aistant posts , and in the Persian Gulf the time ncessary to get them to Basrah or Boui4?^ r , Mr Belgrave's case woula not call i'or more generous treatment, es pecially since his terras are somewhat better, as I have pointed out, than those v .hich the P.R. himself serves under. 11. The views of the Bahrein Govt, do not appear to have been expressed, but no doubt their approval is assumeci n r^, r &lt;A i ;L mm ^ OS fcnrc. ryux (I /V^MV tJi*, ^ J .

U^AiA* —A A.— a-C ^ - J I i ''I LA^- cJ ca -*-^ 1-19/176. ^ ( Belgrave's request for the amendment of his contract. sp^ r rhe condition of furlough after four U /tfni,,^ -s-s •i fs - years was fixed by Col. Prideaux. It 'was accepted without demur 'by Mr. Belgrave. It may be noted that Mr. Thomas,at o -*7- . Muscat, gets 2 months in the year, available after 3 years' service. In discussing the terms of his contsact, Mr. Belgrave asked for the insertion of a clause permitting the accumulation of annual leave up to a total of months, and its r; ^ being taken conjointly with furlough. Col. Prideaux permitted accumulation up to 2 months, but did not permit it to be taken in conjunction with furlough. ^ I i i 1 j^Aj H I* 'M' ^ itii L ni In recommending Mr. Parke for the appointment of O.C., Levy Corps, both Col. Prideaux and Major Daly had in mind that the O.C., Levies, should be a man capable of acting for the Adviser, vide para. 7 of the former's letter No. 181-S., dated 8/5/26; and the latter's P.O.letters 4/9/8 and 10/9/8, dated Jany 1926 and 1/2/26. Ho mention of this, however, was made in the terms of service communicated to Mr. Parke, and the question of an allowance was not raised. I *■ Please see copy of Mr. de Grenier's agreement. He is entitled to 6 months' furlough on 14/1/28. r*T I 'he question of his relief during his absence on was not considered at the time of his appointment.The modification in Mr. de Grenier's contract will enable him to proceed on furlough this year and be back before Mr. Belgrave goes next year, as hopes to. It is for consideration whether the present opportunity should not be utilised to insert in Mr. Belgrave's contract a clause forbidding trade etc., similar to clause 12 of Mr. de Grenier's agreement. . r N. Hi tftMZrc i I yt The suggestion that Mr. Belgrave's contract should be amended from one granted for four ^rears at a time to one for an indefinite period emanated from the late i Sir Hugn uscoe, -he four year period was inserted at the direction of the Government of India (page 13 below, file 19/204). So long as the three months' notice clause remains, there seem little object in making any alteration since the service is not 'permanent government service' and i t has never been intended to bind the State to employ their officials for the whole of their lives, though it may M'u it th em 10 d 0 s 0 . The person most affected, Mr.Belgrave, has not so far as, I know, been consulted. I suggest that he be asked if he wishes the alteration made and if he is indifferent or does not wish it, that the matter be dropped. The late Sir Hugh Biscoe observed to me that he found these contracts confusing. I submit that they cannot be made comprehensive without great detail since they have to include what is covered for Indian government officials by several books of rules and countless audit decisions. i A' C&gt;A&gt; ^ cfc 'uJVvu tr t J.
