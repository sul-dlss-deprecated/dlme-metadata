Harrison, Esq., Commonwealth Relations Office.A In the Sumraary visa Regulations under the head 'Arab States and Trucial Shaikhdoms' the following entries occurs 1. All applications for the grant of visas for persons other than male British subjects should be referred to the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf at Bahrain. 2. In no circumstances should visas be granted to women, whatever their nation ality, without authority from the Political Resident in the Gulf* X X X X 5. Visas should not be granted for any of the Trucial Shaikhdoms to any person, either male or female, without prior authority from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. 2. The rules as they stand often lead to considerable delay in answering enquiries received from passport authorities a about the grant of visas for the Gulf States, and I should like to get the rules revised so as to permit all applications being made direct to the Political Agents it being left to the Political Resident to issue instructions regarding the types of cases, if any, in which a reference should be made to him. 3. Would you kindly let me know whether there is any objection in principle to the above proposals. If not I will write 1 n officially suggesting amendments to the existing rules.

I regret the delay in replying to your reference of the 24th September, The work of issuing passports to British subjects and visas for British territories to foreigners in India and Pakistan is at present carried out by the Ministries of Foreign Affairs at New Delhi and Karachi, This is in accordance with existing practice in the other Dominions, though in Canada, where the Canadian Citizenship Act came into force on l/l/kl, arrangements are now being made under which, in future, non-Canadian British subjects will receive their passports from the U.K, High Commissioner, who will at the same time take over the work of issuing visas to foreigners for the U.K, and British Colonial, etc., territories. It is anticipated that similar arrangements will be made in respect of India and Pakistan (as in the remaining Dominions) as and when the Governments of those countries establish their own citizenship laws (as recommended by the recent British Commonwealth Conference on Nationality and Citizenship,) In the meantime, and until the U.K, High Commissioners are ready to take over the work, visas for British territories, (including the Arab Shaikh- doms in the Persian Gulf) will continue to be issued by the Ministry of External Affairs of the Dominion concerned, A copy of a telegram which has been sent to the Resident in the Persian Gulf is attached.Outward Telegram from Commonwealth Relations Office POL 4227/47 COLE TO : POLITICAL RESIDENT IN THE PERSIAN GULP (Sent 12.30.a.m. I2th November,1947) No.14236 Your telegram No*A/731 dated 19th September* Visas for Arab Shaikhdoms in the Persian Gulf* It is anticipated that United Kingdom High Commissioners in India and Pakistan will eventually be visa-issuing authorities' for British territories generally, but for the present visas will continue to be issued by the Ministry of External Affairs of the Dominion concerned.

This Government have received an application from Syed Mohammad Saleh, a student and a resident of Bahrain for the renewal of his Bahreini passport,, the validity of which expired on July 11 , 1939. It appears from letter No. 1488/2-E of 1358, dated September 11, 1939, from the Grovernment of Bahrain to the Secretary Madrasatul W a izeen, Lucknow, (copy enclosed) that they have no objection to the applicant's return to Bahrain. This (Government are unable to find any authority by which Bahreini passports can be renewed by the authorities in India. According to para.3 of the Foreign Office circular letter No. T2117/593/378, dated March 10 , 1932 received with the old Foreign and Political Department's endorsement No. D. 937-G/32, dated May 7, 1932, this G-overnment are authorised only to grant endorsements and British visas on such pass ports. In the circumstances I am to enquire whether the passports can be renewed by this Government or an Emergency certificate should be granted in this case. Sd/- S. H.

Paragraph 7 of Foreign Office Circular quoted above reads* 'Subject always to standing instructione, visas may be granted to foreigners, other than British subjects, desiring to proceed to any of the above-mentioned territories, but oniy after reference to the local British authorities as specified above*' In the great majority oi cases a reference is mace to this Agency which after ascertaining the views of the Muscat Government gives or refuses the authority to issue the visa applied for.

India direct Foreign Office. S.W.l. 8th February, 1939. Sir, The Under I am directed by Viscount Halifax to transmit to you herewith to be laid before the Secretary of State for India a copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda relative to the endorsement affixed by the Saudi Arabian authorities to the passports of persons leaving Saudi Arabia for Bahrein. 2. Lord Halifax concurs in the view expressed by Sir Reader Bullard that the endorsement of passports in the manner indicated is not to be regarded as a claim on the part of the Saudi-Arabian authorities to jurisdiction over Bahrein or as suggesting that they have any standing to grant visas for that state. The endorsement appears in effect to be nothing more than a type of exit visa for which a comparatively small fee is charged and Lord Halifax is of the opinion that, since the form of the endorsement has been modified, there is little object in protesting on political grounds against the procedure. 3. His Lordship would however, subject to such observations as the Marquess of Zetland may desire to offer, propose to instruct Sir Reader Bullard to point out to the Saudi-Arabian Government for what it is worth that neither in any British territory nor in Bahrein are foreigners required to obtain exit visas before departure and to request that India OfficeA British subjects and Bahreinis leaving Saudi-Arabia may, on a reciprocal basis, be exempted from this requirement.
