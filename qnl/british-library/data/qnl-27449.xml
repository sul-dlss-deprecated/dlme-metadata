A Tetary of mdia. 2 S f t tliU* V(K 7643/7645/234) Dear Lumby, Your letter EXT 3052/42 of the 24th June, about the care or tne uonsuie.r j/remioea m ^'ersia, in the event of evacuation. The care of British Official property, under the circumstances envisaged, would devolve upon the protecting power and, if no former Consular employee is available at any particular post, we can rely on the protecting power to engage a suitable caretaker at their discretion, or take such other steps as may appear necessary. oimilar arrangements have worked smoothly hitherto in countries which have been overrun. I am sending a copy of this letter to Wright at the Treasury. Yours sincerely. E.',7.R. Lumby, Esq., India Office. i utCo, puL.otrr. - 7 JUL '1942 • india mtmEXT.3032/42. Copy t H.M. .V/pight ,Esq.. sury. 2 4 )94g / fip' 1 fyV^L C^) Draft letter. A.B.Hutcheon,Esq. , M.B.E. Foreign Office. Dear Hutcheon, ^ ^ Will you please refer to the correspondence regarding the treatment of local employees in Consular posts in Persia in the event of an evacuation, resting with •• Treasury letter No.E.43832 of August 26th,1941 (your reference No. . K.9055/692/234.) I enclose a copy of an Express Letter from the Government of India, which refers to this correspondence. Though it is some what cryptic, this letter appears to enquire what arrangements are a/n envisaged in the event of^evacuation for the custody of Consular property in those posts in E. Persia where ther , e /areare no local employees other than menials. Prom paragraph 2 of the Government of India’s telegram 42^-6 of August 14th, 1941, it appears that these posts are three in number, viz. Meshed, Zabul and Zahidan. That paragraph suggested arrangements for looking after the property in the first and third of these posts, though now that the U.S.has entered the war : the arrangement contemplated for Meshed would of course no longer be feasible. If the above interpretation of the Government of India’s present enquiry is correct, it it not clear why they have made it ”at the ir^stance of H.M.Legation”. Perhaps, however, you have been in correspondence with the latter on this question. In any case, I should be glad of your viev/s as to the reply v/e should send to the Government of India. I am sending a copy of this letter to Wright at the Treasury ft. W. *. LU.ViSV^5^1 Vrnr~ ir. n - August 23rd 1941.
