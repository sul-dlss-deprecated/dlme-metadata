The elaborate gold frame around the bottom was made of thick sheet gold to which two strands of twisted gold wire flanking notched gold wire were added. The free movement of the interlocking scroll pattern carved into the base of the scarab witness the influence of Cretan art on Egypt of the period. The authenticity of this piece is questioned.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters, 1913", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/33335", "Provenance": "Henry Walters, Baltimore, 1913, by purchase; Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest.", "Dynasty": "12th Dynasty", "OnView": 0, "PublicAccessDate": "2010-07-30T15:42:29.03", "Creator": "Egyptian", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_42.38_Back_DD_RS2009.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_42.38_Back_DD_RS2009.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_42.38_Back_DD_RS2009.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_42.38_Back_DD_RS2009.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_42.38_Back_DD_RS2009.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1543485", "ExhibIDs": "2054, 2513, 2704", "Images": "CUR_42.38_Back_DD_RS2009.jpg, CUR_42.38_Bot_DD_design_RS2009.jpg, CUR_42.38_Bot_DD_RS2009.jpg, CUR_42.38_Rt_DD_RS2009.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Not On View"}
