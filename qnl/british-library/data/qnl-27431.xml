As by arrangement no account is being rendered for this repair, it has not been thought necessary to forward the data under cover of a letter from the Company to the Iranian Government as was done in the case of the 1932 repair, but that the submission of the data in due course, and at an opportune moment, might serve as a reminder that the Iranian Authorities had agreed to settle my Company’s account for the 1932 repair with funds to be made available in their next Budget. If, however, the addressing of such a covering letter seems preferable to the Secretary of State I shall be pleased to have one prepared and sent to you for favour of your kind transmission through the Charge d’Affaires.

Soheily.3, Repair oi Henjam-Bandar Abbas Cable, Captain Lawson told me yesterday that on the previous day he had received a visit from the First Secretary of the Persian Legation, who had asked for Information regarding the way in which the account which Cable and wireless Liroited had presented for the repairs carried out in 19&amp;2 was made up. jlD. doing so he pointed out that the Indo-European Telegraph Department’s account for the previous year had been about one tenth of the Company’s account. Captain Lawson had ejplainea the reasons xor the Company ’ s charges and had added tnat the question did not seem to have much importance as the Persian Government had accepted an offer from the Company to carry out iree of charge, if the 1952 account were settled, certain further repairs which were now necessary to this cable. M. iirdalan had heard nothing of this offer, but went away apparently quite satisfied. Yesterday morning, however, Captain Lawson had received a the Legation asking for explanations about the 19;)2 account. The company had given numerous explanations to the Persian Government already, and had. all the facts and ligures ready, so that the preparation of a reply would present no difficulty. In the circumstances he would be glad to know what I thought he should do. I said that the Persians were very fond of pursuing enquiries, and making appeals or complaints, through two or more channels at once, in the hope that what they could not get by one channel they might get by another. In the present instance/N 2 , instance, it seemed that the instructions which the Persian Legation had received must have come by letter and conse quently have been despatched some little time before the Persian Government had decided to accept the Company's offer. The best course would, in my opinion, be to explain the basis of the 1932 account to the Persian Legation as a matter of politeness, making the explanations correspond as nearly as possible to those given to the Persian Director-General of Telegraphs, but to add something to the effect that the Legation would doubtless be glad to know that the whole question had now been arranged in Tehran. 20th December, 1935. ii14—6130 10950 (2) In any further communication on this subje^, please quote no.£T Ll32?/3L^ ana address —not to any person by name, but to— “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London THE Under-Secretary of State fo compliments to TLo JU A - - presents his ^ 4 —^ ~?^ VN - ^ and, by direction of the Secretary of State, transmits herewith cop \e4 of the under-mentioned paper.

We have never had any correspondence with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs on the subject of the Company’s bill for the 1932 repairs.

Since then, however, this company has changed its name and although the change has, according to His Majesty's Minister, been notified by the company's legal adviser in Tehran to the authorities charged with the administration of the Persian company registration law, it seems desirable that the change should in addition be formally notified to the Persian Government by His Majesty's Legation. 3.

In all the circumstances, the right course to adopt appears to be lor the Compaiy to give a full explanation to the Persian Government of the basis of the charges and the reasons for which they are so much in excess of those previously made by the I.I.T.D., and if they are not, in fact, prepared to reduce the amount of their bill, so to inform tne Persian Govt.

A reference to the accounts shows that our share in the repairs of 1925/26 amounted to Rupees 1171/12/6. I may add that the total cost of repairs was always in the limit of 2500 Rupees. During the negociation for the conclusion of the 1932 Telegraph agreement when the Persian Government agreed that the repairs to the foresaid cable be carried by your company on their behalf, they were under the impression that such repairs would be in the limit of 2500 Rupees only. So they are much surprised to find that they are now requested to pay more than one pound Sterling for each Rupee for the same repairs. Under the circumstances I am directed to enter in communication with you with a view to obtain a substantial reduction of the account submitted and I shall be very grateful if you will kindly reconsider the matter in the light of the information and the figures given above and reply at your earliest convenience.

IV f-para.3 of the Agreement of February 1932 clearly lays down the conditions on which the Company, a'p the agent of H.M.G. and the G.of I. 16 to assist the Persian Govt, in regard to repairs to the submarine section of the Henjam-Bunder Abbas cable and definitely states that such repairs are to be at the expense of the Persian Govt. There is thus no justification for a Persian claim for special terms.4. The Persian suggestion that the former arrangement under which the cost of repairs to this cable was shared between the Persian Govt, and the I.E.T.D. and that a corresponding arrangement should be accepted by I.&amp; l.C. is also without foundation. The Persian Govt, did indeed make such a suggestion in the course of the negotiations which led up to the conclusion of the Agreement of 17th February 17February-1932, but they were informed in a memorandum enclosed in an official note of 22nd June 1931 addressed by HIM. Minister at Tehran to the Persian M.F.A. that rt the Company are aware that half the cost of the repairs to the Henjam-Bunder Abbas cable used to be borne bj the Indo-European Telegraph Dept. The reason, however, was that in those days the operation of that cable came within the Department’s system and the Department received a share of tne Persian terminal rate. Hence forth the Persian administration will operate this cable and will receive the whole of the terminal rate. It is therefore only fair that the Persian Govt, should bear the cost of maintenance of this cable. The Company are also going a long way to meet the requirements of the Persian Govt, by making their cable ship available for effecting the necessary•aft Paper. 2531 5000 2.34 Department. repairs and they cannot reasonably be expected to bear any part of the cost of repairing what is now a purely Persian line.' The note concluded by intimating that this, together with certain other amendments, could not be considered and the point appears to have been dropped by the Persians. 5. We would suggest in these circumstances that the Company should reply to the Persian Govt, taking their stand on the terms of the agreement, but emphasising that the charges notified by them to the Persian Govt, are in fact more generous than they need have been (if I am correct in understanding that this is the effect of the modification referred to in the last paragraph of your letter under reply)■—mm rjvl RLE BAR 1222. ram.

Kershaw, „ (XL* li+JdU* y u , I attach a note on the question of the possible withdrawal of the Gulf cables from Persia which has been the subject of informal discussion. The general effect is that in the circumstances described in the note it does not seem possible to take any step of this nature at the present time, although it might be possible to uo so later if the C.I.D. take a different view as to the strategic importance of these cables and the possibility of their being satisfactorily replaced by wireless, and if the Persians afford us a sufficiently good pretext (at present lacking) for so drastic a step. I propose, if no objection is seen, to write to the Foreign Office, with whom the matter has been exhaustively discussed, as in the draft below. u /■oa GL co aa Ur ^ &gt; Under the Agreement with Persia regarding the withdrawal of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, the Persian Government agree to grant facilities to an agent to he nominated hy H.M.G. and the Government of Inula to maintain the cable stations in the Persian Gulf. That Agreement has not yet been ratified but all the arrangements for ratification are in train. Unuer the terms of their understanding with us the Communications Company (who will be nominated as our agent under the terms of the Agreement with Persia) are required to maintain cable and wireless communication in the Gulf. This involves maintaining the existing wireless stations at Bushire and Henjam in addition to a formal responsibility for the wireless station at Lingah which has been closed down for several months. We have informed the Persians that we are prepared to transfer to them as part of a satisfactory general treaty settlement the wireless station at Bushire and the wireless at Lingah. We are also prepared to transfer the wireless station at Henjam, but on condition that it shall oe re-leased to us on certain terms for a fixed period. The Agreement with Persia about the withdrawal of the I«E»I*D« makes no reference to and does not in any way affect the position of these wireless stations. 2 # Difficulty arose in the autumn oi this year about the import of spare parts for the wireless stations, the point in issue being whether or not customs duties would have to be paid on them. The Communications Company were advised/advised that as no provision to the contrary had been made in the Telegraph Agreement customs duties would probably have to be paid and various suggestions were made and are under consideration for evading these. The Minister at Tehran, in commenting, remarked that a formal request to the Persians for permission would probably result in a request for the Immediate transfer, in anticipation oi a treaty settlement, of the wireless stations in question and asked what action would take in the face of such a demand. 3. The situation at this stage was further complicated by the fact that relations with Persia were definitely strained consequent on their formal request for the evacuation of the British naval station at Henjam. There was a distinct risk that negotiations might break down ana that relations might become definitely hostile. This situation has now to some extent been eased by the tone of the Persian reply to the representations made by us, which suggests that their request for the evacuation of Henjam was to some extent a bargaining move, but that they remain prepared to conclude the treaty. 4. The Foreign Office in the course of this summer teve suggested to us that it might be a good n thing to remove the cable stations from Persian territory in the interests of reducing our commitments in Persia. The objections seen to action on these lines are set out in my demi-official letter of 3 S(2 [3Z f to Mr. Hendel. In the circumstances described above, however, consideration was again given to the possibility of/of removing tiie c&amp;lDles* Priiiict. iacie if seemed, possible, if %”fre general relations with Persia deteriorated and if the Persians made themselves difficult to the Communications Company, to consider removing the cables (which would save the Company £50,000 a year) informing the Persians that they had made action on these lines inevitable by their obstructive behaviour and that we could take no responsibility for the result and that since it was their own fait that this means of communication with India had been removed we should not feel called upon to give them any facilities for communication with India by a trans-Persia line. So far as the Communications Company were concerned, since it would be essential to maintain communications of sane sort in the Gulf, it was thought that we might ask them, as a condition of being released from their obligation to maintain the cables, to establish a first-class wireless station at Koweit, sufficiently powerful to carry all our Gulf communications. The possibility of action on these lines turned essentially on two things - first, the Persians giving us a sufficiently good excuse; secondly, the C.I.D. modifying their classification of the Persian Gulf cables as being of definite strategic importance. 5. we have not yet got a final ruling on this last point, but the result of the informal soundings which Colonel Pepys has taken of the »Var Office ^has been to show that it is probable that the C.I.D. are unlikely to alter the classification -at any rate at this stage. The main objections wriich are likely to be seen are the fact/ + {icict' tnat atmospherics in the Persian Quit' (particularly auring the monsoon) render wireless to some extent unreliable; that cypher messages transmitted by wireless are exposed to a greater risk of being broken, and that in any case, unless the wireless station concerned is always v/orking at full pitch, the volume of work passing through it at any given time is a fairly reliable indication to interested parties outside of the acuteness or otherwise of a local situationp As regards the first point, it is, I fear, impossible reasonably to contend that .the Persian attitude so far, tiresome as it has been in sane ways (particularly over the registration of the Communications Company) has been sufficiently difficult to justify us in taking so drastic a step as withdrawing the cables; and since the wireless stations in the Gulf are not covered by the Telegraph Agreement we could not very satisfactorily base any very drastic action on a Persian refusal to allow us to import spare parts, or even a Persian demand for the premature cession of those stations* 6* The question as a whole has been discussed with the Foreign Office at some length in the light of the considerations indicated above. While they would still be quite glad to see the cables away from Persia if this could be done without giving the Persians a legitimate grievance, they agree that in^ the circumstance *1* CU. AtU* f V bo pj- QSACl J there is nothing to be done but to - ratify the agreement and let matters stay as they are. It will, ox course, always be possible for us, if the Persians give us a sufficiently good pretext by unduly pressing the Company in the future, and if the C.I.D., as the result of/ rnof improvements in wireless communication,are/prepared to face the risks of depending solely on wireless in the G-ulf area, to inform the Persians (after discussion with the Company) that they had made matters so difficult that our agent is no longer prepared to serve us and that we cannot compel him to do so or find a satisfactory substitute and that the cable system must therefore be withdrawn. Tne Foreign Office propose, as matters stand, to inform Mr. Hoare, who has telegraphed that everything is ready for ratification, that he may proceed. 7. As regards the relatively minor question of the wireless stations, I mentioned to the Foreign Office that we should, I thought, see very strong objection to handing them over to Persia except as part of a that satisfactory treaty settlement and/we should take this line in the event of any Persian demand to that effect being made. I suggest that I might be authorised to write to Mr. Rendel as in the draft attached.?aft Paper. political Department. DRAFT LaTTER. 1 Tnf0fi932 &lt;r^i lAA^vyj^ 05^ O.W. Rendel, Rsq., G *M.

Although the Telegraphs Agreement signed on February 13th makes no mention of the wireless stations, there is no doubt that they are, for as long as the company operates them, integral parts of the system of communication maintained by the soap any, with the approval of the Persian Government on Persian soil* Lecor&amp;tngly, if it were only a question of securing permission to mport the material under the Trade Monopoly Law or similar legis- ation, I should have little hesitation in recommending that it should H e imported as cable material* • The question is unfortunately complicated by the fact that the oterial imported by the company for the use of the cable stations s imported free of duty under the terms of the Telegraphs Agreement, hlch will presumably soon be in force. Any wireless material would Dneequently have to be Imported free of duty also, if the difference Rtween it and cable material were not to be disclosed, and would thus auee the company to benefit financially at the expense of the Persian ave niaent in a matter not provided for in any agreement, written or written. Although I consider that morally the company are fully ^titled to this benefit, seeing that the material is needed to keep In ght Honourable John Simon G.C.S.I., 5tc *» etc., etc.. The Foreign Office®xrr\ in good repair two stations which are expected tm ultimately to hecome the property of the Persian Government themselves, it would unquestionahly he more ingenuous to place these considerations before that Government and secure their approval beforehand. 4. If the Persian Government were invited to allow the import of material for the wireless stations free of Trade Monopoly Law restrictions and customs dues, on the ground that the material was needed for the upkeep of stations which they would naturally wish to receive in due course in good repair, I do not think that they would refuse to allow it to he imported at all or (though I am less confident on this point) insist on the payment of customs dues. They would almost certainly, however, ask that the stations should he handed over to them without more delay and If this were refused it is not impossible that they might take steps to prevent their further use# This question cannot he considered apart from the general political situation, which has now developed to the point where the negotiations are practically suspended and a request for the removal of the naval depot from Hen jam may come at any time (see my despatch No. 589 of 10th September)* I accordingly recommend that I should not address say enquiry to the Persian Government on this subject until His Majesty’s Govern ment have decided upon the course of action they will adopt in the event of a demand for the surrender of the stations, treaty or no treaty, being received: and of more active steps being taken by the Persian Government in support of this demand. 6. notwithstanding anything that I have written above, I see no objection to the import as cable material of any small quantities of wireless material that may be needed to keep the stations in properproper repair while this question is being considered* 7* I bm sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (Bo* 188) and to the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf at Bush ire (No* 147)* I have the honour to be with the highest respect, Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant, (Signed) R.H*HOARE*r , ) ■3 2 i29l/64/34) DEImT I al TREaSUHY CHAMBERS, WHITEHALL, S.V/.l. llth October, 1932.

I notice that Article 4 of the Agreement between the British and Indian Governments and the Persian. Government dated 17th February 1932 contains the following provisions;- Le Gouvernement persan permettra a un agent nomine par le Gouvernement du Royaume-Uni et le Gouvernement de 1'lnde et cela, jusqu'au le ler mars 1945, de proc^der a I'entre- tien et aux operations des stations assurant le fonctionne- ment du cable so us-mar in a Bouchir Hengam, Dj&amp;sk et Tcharbar, ainsi que de la section de la ligne Dj&amp;sm-Gwadur qui se troube en territoire persan. Le Gouvernement persan exeraptera des droits de douane et de toutes autres taxes quelconques le materiel et lee appareils necessaires au bon fonctionnement tant de ia ligne terrestre que des cables et stations de cable. It is not easy to understand how any difficulty has arisen. It was undoubtedly the intention tnat ur.e T ngent to be nominated by the British and Indian Governments oho Id be E. Thompson, Esq. i I 1 : .f mi \ rxbe the Communications Company. Documents forwarded to us with an India Office letter of the 20th September 1900 included a memorandum dated 11th March 1920* of which the summary includes the following:- (g) The Persian Government will permit the British Government, either directly or through an authorised # British Agent, to continue to maintain and work cable offices at Bushire, Eenjam, Jask and Charbar and the land telegraoh line from Jask to Charbar. Instruments and stores required for the cables and land line to be admitted free of customs and other duties. An I *0,C. paper No.1255 gives a cop^ of a letter from the India Office to the Secretary, Imperial Communications Committee (the date is not reproduced but may have been in the earlier part of December 1920) of which the following is the Second paragraph;- Simultaneously with the handing over to the Persian Government of the Persian land Hues, the Persian Gulf Cable system and assets will be handed over to the Imperial and International Communications Ltd. in accordance with arrangements reached between the Secretary of State in Council and the Company. In pursuance of these arrangements the Communications Company undertake to maintain the existing cable and wireless communications in the Gulf. I should have thought that the point of importance would be to secure that the stations and section of telegraph line should be worked by the Communications Company as such and not by a Persian subsidiary; that the Company should thereforetherefore be nominated as Agent by the Governments of Great Britain and of India; and that in view of the agreement quoted above it should be possible to persuade the Persian Government that in accordance with the agreed scheme the Communications Company should be allowed to do the worn and that no question of fees should arise.

Minister at Teheran, on the Company’s request, attempted to secure total exemption but Persia refused. Sven his endeavour to obtain the relief accorded to Transport Companies in Persia also failed. The question of the formation of a special Company has been considered but there is a doubt whether the moderate capital which would make it worth while would satisfy Persia, and there is further no guarantee that other legislation may not be enacted in future. At a Committee Meeting of various Departments the view was strongly expressed that in consideration of the Company's status as ^gent, - • ^-overn ment should make itself responsible for securing exemption, or for the Persian Pee. There is also the additional reason that it is believed that the formation of a special company would not be considered favourably by the India Office who orefer xo be represented by a Company of the standing of I.&amp; I-C. The Company is fully aware of the efforts made by Majesty's Minister at Teheran to secure total exemption, it is difficult to see what further steps can be taken, but before proceeding with the registration of the Company m PersiaPersia it was considered that the i^dvisor^ Committee should be acquainted with the facts and their advice and support requested both as regards the payment of the heavy registration fee and the risk of capital taxation in the future.

Dear Coote , While I was away from the Office last week Thompson sent you a copy of a memorandum handed in by Mr. Dennison Pender at the meeting of the Imperial Communications Advisory Committee on the 4th October last on the position of the I and I.C. in Persia. On the 11th October he sent you a copy of a letter from Welch of the Post Office on the same subject. The diffici Ities referred to by the Company appear to have arisen since the signing of the Convention in February last and there appears to have been some discussion with Departments of which I x^crsonally am not cognizant. The Treasury interest seems prima facie to be confined to the suggestion that H.M.G. should pay the cost of registration of the subsidiary Persian Company if formed, but we shall clearly have to give the Advisory Committee a lead as to the reply which the Committee should make to Mr. Dennison Pender. May I take it that I shall receive in due course from you the necessary material on which to base a communication to the Advisory Committee? Yours etc., (SOD) F.P. ROBINSON. Coote, Esq.

Department. t Please see Mr.Hendel’s d.o. letter of 14th June on P.Z.3512/32. The letter arises out of a private letter f r cm Mr.Hoare to Sir Lancelot Oliphant raising the question whether, in view of the difficulties raised by the Persians in connection with the registration fee payable by the Communications Company and of the possibility that the Residency may leave Bushire and the naval base Henjam, it is really necessary to continue to maintain cable stations on the Persian coast at all. 2. It will be remembered that under our agreement with the Communications Company they are obliged to maintain the cable communications in the Gulf. This involves the retention of cable stations at Bushire, Bunder Abbas, Hen jam, Jask and Gwadur, all but the last named being in Persian territory. The cable for the most part runs outside Persian territorial waters but has, of course, to pass through these waters for a short space in order to make its connection at the Persian ports noted. 3. In so far as a decision on this question turns on the difficulties raised by the Persian Government in connection with the registration fee payable by the Communications Canpany, the situation has developed further since the date of Mr.Rende^s letter. It has proved impossible to persuade the Persians to treat the Company as a transport concern for the purpose of the registration law. On the other hand the Company, so far as can be judged, are prepared in the last resort to pay the full fee of £14Q0, but before resigning themselves to this are exploring actively the possibility of forming a subsidiary company in England for registration in Persia on a relatively very small capital, the registration fee i on/on which would he of little importance. Unless therefore the removal of the cables from Persia is desirable from our point of view I do not think we need concern ourselves with the question merely because of the effect of non-removal on the Company. 4. The reasons for which we decided to require of the Company that they should maintain these cables are as f ollows: - (a) Government canmuni cat ions with the Residency and with Henjamf (b) The fact that the cables were scheduled as of strategic value by the Imperial Cable and Wireless Conference so recently as 1928 (B.W.C.27/8, enclosed in C.I.D. paper No.851 B of 14th December 1927). The Sub-Ccmrcittee recognised that with the improvement in wireless which was to be expected, 'It may be found to be “Justifiable to introduce a correspondingly larger proportion of messages^f^r wireless transmission' and added 'We suggest, therefore, that our recommendations in regard to the numbers of cables to be maintained for purely strategic purposes should be reviewed from time to time in the light of developments in wireless practice and performance.' Por the purpose of communication with India in time of war they recommended that the maintenance was essential, inter alia , of one Cover nm enter India cable, Karachi, Bushire, Fao (for Basra) calling at Jask, to meet requirements in the event of 4 &lt;4 I operations in the Persian Gulf.’ m i f (c) The relatively undeveloped condition of wireless in this area and the danger that removal of the principal link between Iraq, Persia and India, would give rise to serious complaints from the Indian commercial community. In the interest of the Communications Cempany. These cables are being maintained at a heavy loss to the Company who, from that point of view, would be glad to be rid of them. On the other hand they have a value from the Company’s standpoint, since, so long as they remain as maintained we can reply to any request from Persia for the re-establishment of through communication with India alon^g the central Persian land line, that sufficient facilities already exist via Bushire and the Gulf cables. The Communications Company have consistently been/ -WMinute Paper Department been very apprehensive lest the central tersian land line should 'be re-opened,and the effect of such re-opening on their receipts would, so far as we are aware, he serious. The closing down of the Gulf cables would make it very difficult for ua to resist a request for such re-opening if made by Persia. 5. To the arguments set out above in favour of maintaining these lines there must now be added the further argument that after very considerable discussion with Persia in the course of which we have done our utmost to convince the Persians that the withdrawal of the I.E.T.D. represented a real concession to them and that it was to their interest to grant facilities for the continued maintenance of the Gulf cables to the Communications Company operating as our Agents, we have concluded and signed, though not ratified, an agreement providing for the maintenance of those cables up to 1945. We could, it is true, get out of our bargain and refuse to ratify the agreement. But the effect of action of this nature on the Persians could not, one would imagine, be anything but most unfortunate, and even if we could not be charged with breaking the isew, we undoubtedly should have broken the spirit of our agreement. We should hardly, I think, be justified in taking action of this nature unless the conduct of the Persians in regard to the grant of minor facilities in connection with these lines was such as to put us on strong ground in doing so. While they have been tiresome I do not think that we could reasonably claim that they have been tiresome to such a degree as t o justify our following this course. 6. The situation might, it is true, be changed if the Residency were to move from Bushire and the naval base togo to Hen jam. But there is likely to he considerable delay before either of these events happens and our present policy is to do our utmost to stave off the evil day. As regards the Residency,Sir Hugh Biscoe in a private letter of 24th June says:- w Hoare writes that he has seme slight hope of Taimour agreeing to leave me in peace.” However this may be,there seems little to be said for withdrawing the cables so long as there is any chance of the Residency remaining - the effect on the Political Resident's communications would be very serious 7. Again, so long as Bushire and Hen^-om remains ih our possession we should have little, if any, prospect of securing permission frexn the Persians to establish wireless stations of such a nature as to make up for the K withdrawal of the cables, and the other reasons stated 'Mn para.4 above in favour of the maintenance of the cables seem tome for practical purposes to retain full force at the present time. 8 . As regards Mr.Hoare's suggestion that we might continue to maintain the cable but outside Persian territorial waters, the objections are, firstly, that this would cut off Bushire and Henjam, secondly, that we were advised,when this point was raised with Mr.Perry at an earlier stage, that the present cable is in such a condition that unless it were relaid at great expense it would be impracticable to employ it as a submarine cable without fairly frequent landing places. Railing the retention of our existing stations on the Persian coast it would therefore be necessary to run new cables up the Gulf at great expense. 9. I submit in these circumstances that, in view of the force of the other arguments against removal there is/ * ^ , V tvs. ox tr&lt;t X &amp; CCa. iaJxaXIZ**. bj.

DRAFT; LBTT1T.B. 17 m 1932 My dear George, I am very sorry to have been so long in replying to your letter of 14th June, No.E. 2493/47/34, about the retention of our cable stations on the Persian coast, but it has necessitated a certain amount of research and I * have been very pressed with other I work. L 2. Since the date of your letter, Hoare has reported that there is no chance of persuading the Persians to treat the Communications Company as a transport concern for the purpose of the registration law. I understand, however, that the Company (so far as we can judge here) will, in the last resort, probably be prepared to pay the full registration fee of £1400 if they find they have no choice in the matter,and that they are at the moment actively engaged in examining the possibility of forming a subsidiary company in England for registration in Persia. I do not think , in view of their general attitude so far as we know it, that our decision need be particularly influenced by its reactions on them. 3./ yj 617 5000 1.32*&amp;*£{*. 1AA4A. 0-4~ a ljB&gt;a J 3. Broadly speaking, after * re-examination of the question as a whole, we still think ‘that the balance of advantage rests with maintaining the cable stations, and our reasons for this conclusion are as follows:- In the first place, as Hoare recognised and as you mentioned in your letter, the landing stations are definitely important so long as we retain Bushire and Henjam. It is quite true that we may have to abandon both. But as you know the question, part-i-cularly in the case- of-Hen^am-y is still the subject of (considerable controversy, and it is conceivable that there may be sane considerable delay before we have to move from either. 4. Secondly, from the point of view of the Communications Company the retention of these eafrleg]Jkga &amp; w value. As you know, they have always been very apprehensive that Persia might seek to re-open through ccmmunication with India along the central Persian land line, which was handed over to her as part of the Worrito&gt;y settlement*fc/hen atfhar request we went into the point with the Government of India^ the decision reached was that in the event of Persia making such a move our best tacties/aft Paper. tan*, (ty* it Department. 617 5000 1.32 tactics would be to reply that sufficient facilities already exist for communicating with India via Bushire and the Gulf cables, and that we should not, therefore, be* prepared to comply with such a request. Clearly, if the Gulf cable stations disappeared, we should not be able (or at any rate we should find it very difficult) to take this line with Persia* 5. Thirdly - though perhaps the answer to this might be that an adequate wireless substitute could be provided r^we are rather afraid ^ that removal of the cables would lead to serious ccmplaints from the Bombay mercantile community and 1 frcm other Indian traders. They are used to a substantial ea****^**^ by Indian commercial concerns for communications with Iraq and with | Persia. 6. Finally, and this we think is a really serious objection, there is the question of the reaction on Persia of a decision at this stage to go back on the agreement which we have reached with them (though I recognise, of course, that it has not/not been ratified) and remov^gg the landing stations. Our efforts all through the negotiations on the telegraph question have been directed to persuading the Persians that we were giving them something for nothing, that we had withdrawn the I.E.T.D. in deference to them and that it was definitely to their interest, as well as to ours, that we should retain the Gulf cable stations, and that the Communications C anpany should be authorised to work them as our agents up to 1945. It is, of course, the case that they have been very tiresome in their dealings with the Company and matters might reach a stage at which we should find it necessary to threaten them with withdrawal of the stations unless they amended their ways. But I doubt if we could conscientiously say that that stage had been reached, and in these circumstances our feeling here is that the Persians not only might regard the withdrawal of the stafiohs^on what they might claim was an insufficient pretext, as an unfriendly act, but that they might, not withoutjustice, accuse us of a breach of the spirit if not of the letter of our recent cm » agreement. We / think this an argument of considerable force. For the reasons I have given/V raft Paper. Department. tXK. f ^ rw'. given above we should not be disposed to favour at this stage the withdrawal of the landing stations, But there are further difficulties. As you know we have had a certain amount of discussion infomally with Perry of the Ccmmunications Company on this subject at earlier stages in the negotiations when we thought we might have to use withdrawal as a threat. L Our record of those discussions shows i that the present cable is in such a condition that unless relaid at great expense it would be impracticable to employ it as a purely submarine cable without fairly frequent landing _ places, and that failing the landing stations it would be necessary to run new cables up the Gulf at great expense. This seems to us to dispose for practical purposes of the suggestion that the cable might be disconnected from the Persian landing points and taken outside Persian territorial waters, even though the more general objections to closing down these landing stations which I have discussed above were regarded as invalid. 8 8. As for the 1 substitution of 617 5000 1.32 wireless, t he C.I.D. iieciBlon _lg which I refer Twill be - found in the report/jj report of the Sub-Conmittee on _____ _ _ nglniUEft wireless ' and cable services of 1927 (Paper No.B.W.C.(27)-8, enclosed inC.I.D. paper No.851 B, of 14th December 1927). The report of the Sub-Ccmmittee recognises that H with improvements in directional transmission and reception, interception and interference will become increasingly more difficult, and it may be found to be justifiable to entrust a correspondingly larger proportion of messages to wireless transmission . We suggest therefore that our .recommendations in regard to the numbers of cables to be maintained for purely strategical purposes should be reviewed from time to time in the light of developments in wireless practice and performance.” They then proceed to state that the maintenance is essential of, inter aMai . . . ” one Government of India cable, Karachi, Bushire, ¥** (for Basra) calling at Jask to meet requirements in the event of operations in the Persian Gulf.” This cable is required in connection with communications with India in the event of war.' &amp;s you will see it would be perfectly possible on this recommendation for us to go back to L the C.I.D. and ask them to reconsider whether/aft Paper. 617 5000 1.32 Department. whether the development of wireless in the last four years had been such as to alter the situation radically. But, in view of the objections stated above to making any move we doubt if it is worth troubling the C.I.D. at this stage, * 6s o&amp;y UsL. r f^ybtci I jyusvn I i r nc4^ ft ' hMl? a; it l: t ut) r 'N ( 'Y ry ^y^) ?js .tfgn) PORKIG-N OFFICE, S.W.l.

The present position is that Hoare is trying to induce the Persians to treat the Company as a transport concern for the purposes of the registration law; which would mean the reduction of the fee to twenty five per cent of the original assessment. There is also a proposal, regarding which the Legation are seeking legal advice in Tehran, that the main company should form a subsidiary company in England, for registration in Persia, with a declared capital of about ten thousand pounds. The enclosed copy of a letter from Hoare raises the i ENCLOSURE iH WcEKlY LETTER question No. 224 16 JUN.1S32 ! lithwaite Esq. FROM SECRETARY, POLITICAL AND SECRET DEPT. INDIA OFFICEquestion whether, if the Residency and the naval depot have to he moved from Bushire and Henjam respectively, it will really he necessary from our point of view to maintain cable stations on the Persian coast at all* If not, it is just as well that Hoare should he aware of the position, which he may well he able to turn to our advantage, if only in connection with this minor point of the Company’s registration fee* We realise, of course, that all this is as yet extremely hypothetical, depending as it does on the failure of any scheme to get the Company’s fee reduced to more reasonable proportions, and, to an even greater extent, on the necessity for the eventual removal from Persia of both the Residency and the Hen jam depot 5 hut in view of the difficulties which we have experienced since the Company took over from the Indo European Telegraph Department, and of the general desirability of reducing as far as possible our commitments in Persia, it seems to us that the whole position is worth investigating fully, and we shall he most interested to learn what you think of it* The solution which Hoare actually has in mind appears toto ‘be that the cable should remain in use, hut should he re-laid down the Gulf outside Persian territorial waters - (see paragraph 4 of his letter). There is, however, the alternative possibility that the use of the cable should simply be discontinued, communications between Iraq and India being maintained exclusively by wireless. As far as we know, Hoare is correct in assuming that from the commercial and financial point of view the Company have no interest in the operation of the Persian section of the system, and we have a strong impression that they would even prefer, if it were not for their agreement with the India Office, to abandon the Gulf cables altogether and use wireless instead. Can you say whether this correctly represents the Company’s position? As regards the position of His Majesty’s Government, there is apparently a decision of the Communications Department of the Committee of Imperial Defence - (see your letter No. P«8085/30 of November 26th, 1930, to Earner) - to the effect that the Gulf cable is of strategic importance We have, however, been unable to discover in our archives anyairt** (P any papers regarding this decision, the date on which it was taken, or the reasons on which it was based. It may he that in the intervening period the rapid advance of wireless telegraphy has appreciably altered the position from the strategic point of view. Or, again, the decision may be completely dependent upon the retention of the Residency at Bushire and of the depot at Henjam. Do you think it would be worth while asking the Communications Department of the Committee of Imperial Defence to reconsider the strategic importance of the cables? There remains Hoare*s suggestion in paragraph 4 of his letter that the Persian cable stations should be abandoned and that those parts of the cable which are now in Persian territorial waters should be re-laid so that in future the cable should go from Pao to Gwadar or Karachi without entering Persian v/aters at all. This raises several questions such as the following:- (a) How important is it for the working of the cable to retain the alternative land-line between Jask and Gwadar? I remember seeing it stated some where that there are frequent interruptions in the working of the corresponding submarine section during the monsoons.(■b) Is it true that the Gulf cable may possibly be so old and shaky that any extensive tampering with it would probably lead to a general breakdown? (c) Are we certain that this very ancient cable is of a type that does not need the present power relays at the various land stations in Persia? (d) Are we certain, again, that the cable only enters Persian territorial waters at a sharp angle, and in the immediate neighbourhood of the cable stations? Or is it not more likely that it lies within Persian waters for considerable stretches between stations? (e) Finally, will not the cost of altering the cable system be extremely high and out of all proportion to the non-recurrent Persian registration fee of one thousand four hundred pounds? (f) On the other hand if the cable is so old and shaky as it has been represented, will it not need heavy expenditure in any case, and might it not be cheaper to abandon it altogether and use wireless instead? All these questions would, presumably, have to be discussed, with the Communications Company, and we do not suggest that this should be done for the present. In the first place, we shall be glad of your observations on the two points, of the wireless alternative, and of the strategic importance cables,N cables, see paragraphs 4 to 6 above. As you know we have not yet deposited our ratifications of the Telegraphs Agreement, and I do not think there is really any compelling reason why we should, if it is decided that, in view of circumstances which have since come to light, it is not in our interest to do so.Y /47/34) /32-13. 0 7 A* -1 o BRITISH LEGATION, TEHRAN. April 30th, 1932. My dear Oli^hant, / My despatch No. 213 cf today regarding the registration of the Imperial and International Communications Company will show you that I am trying to get their registration fee reduced by 75%, as a transport company i.e., from £1,400 to £350. 2. I hope my appeal will succeed, but we must consider what we and the company are to do if it fails. The following suggestion is made on the assumption that from the commercial point of view the Imperial and International Communications Company don’t really want to run the Gulf Cables at all, fee or no fee, and only do so because it is part of their contract. 3. It seems to me that if the Persian Govern ment insist on payment of the fee in full and the Political Resident is obliged to move from Bushire and the Navy are obliged to leave Henjam, we ought to consider whether it is really necessary to maintain cable stations on the Persian coast at all. 4. Strategically, the cable would, I presume, be safer if it went straight from Fao to Gwadar or narachi in the open sea-bed: and I understand that this could be brought about by the interspersion of sections of cable of a few miles each opposite Bushire, Henjam and Jask. 5. Practically, a good deal of inconvenience would be caused to the Legation, the Consuls at Bushire and Bander/ jancelot Oliphant, E.C.M.G. , C.B., fie foreign Office.with equs-Ed^M’ty• 8. Bander Abbas (the latter by the way seems to have got on very well for the last year with the Heniam- Bander Abbas cable out of commission) and possibly the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and other British interests; but Persia has other telegraphic communications with the outside world (as well as the wireless) and I do not think the incon venience would be insurmountable. 6. In any case I might say to the Persian Government at need: 'We quite see your difficulty about the regist ration fee and would not dream of pressing you to do ,f anything against the law. Unfortunately the Imperial and ”International Communications Company look upon their 'operations in Persia in a purely commercial light: their 'prospects of making a profit are small as it is, but 'with your registration fee they will be nil (l suppose this 'would’nt necessarily be so, but no matter): they have 'therefore asked to be relieved of their obligations to 'run the cables: His Majesty’s Government do not feel able 'to refuse and cannot find another agent. This means the 'cable stations must close. I tell you this with the less 'hesitation iiecause I know that you would really he much 'happier if there were no British stations on Persian 'soil at all. V. X think the reaction to this would probably he 'good heavens, no! 'He like having your stations. 'He can't possibly get on with them. What do you want us to do?' Nevertheless I should he loath to suggest withdrawal the Persians unless we really were prepared to withdraw8 # I do not put forward this idea of withdrawal as one to which I am in any sense wedded, hut merely as one which might profitably be ’’explored”. In the meanwhile it plo-ht not be a bad thing to exercise a little mild procrastination about sending out the ratified copy of the Telegraphs Agreement for the exchange, in the hope that before it arrives we may know, definitely and finally, the future of the Residency and Henoam. 9, Above all, I do now want to pursue this suggestion if it would mean throwing people out of employment. 10. I have sent copies of this letter to the Government of India (No.90) and Bushire (No.76). Yours ever, (Sgd.) R.H.Hoare.\ ?7&amp; ■ ; 1-J95 2. j NO 'OIST^IBUTION. Decypher. Mr. Hoare (Teheran) D.

I therefore recommend sub sidiary should be formed in London though I cannot guarantee that registration can be effected without some opposition. Most convenient title would be 'Imperial and Internationa 1 Communications Company (Persia) Limited'. Put use of the word 'Imperial' in a title also containing word 'Persia' may cause difficulties.

Mr. Hoare will therefore he instructed to arrange for the simultaneous deposit of ratifications. 2. I am further directed to state that Sir John Simon proposes to prepare separate instruments of ratification in resnect of the United Kingdom and India. It will be recalled that the Agreement was originally drafted in tripartite and governmental form, and orovision was consequently made for the deposit of ratifications. Owing to an oversight, no change was made in the wording of the relevant passage when, in deference to the wishes of the Persian Government, it was later agreed to alter the form of uhe agreement and make it one between Heads of States. v/here, however, there are only two instruments of ratification, it is of course customary to exchange them rather than deposit them; hence it appears preferable in this case, where special Provision is made for deposit, that there shall be three separate instruments of ratification, in respect of the Uniced Kingdom, India and Persia.

Moreover they doubted v/hether there was any real necessity for the wireless service with Persia in addition to the cominunlc&amp;tion already provided by the lines and cables of the Indo-European Telegraph Department. In view however of the fact that the future of the Department was under considera tion the Government of India desired to know what reply should be sent to the circular which had merely been formally acknowledged. 6 .

In this connection reference is invited to coir eapondence which took place in August 1930 in connection with the n r between this Office and the Conrnuni cat ions Con^any » regarding the Indo-European Telegraph Dtpartffltnt* Arising out of a representation made to hixs by the Communications Company Sir houis Kershaw sent a personal telegram to Siar Bhore on 15th August saying that the Company were greatly concerned at the possibility that after the Indo-European Telegraph Depart? ent have surrendered their concessions the Internat ional route as a competing force might be re-opened possibly under American control They asked therefore whether if the Internet ional route were re-opened the Government of India would be willing to impose a rate on the section Karachi and the Persian Frontier sufficiently high to make their rate equal to that charged by the Company* They also asked whether* if tireless communication was established, e •£• between the United i tates of America and Tehran*messages being re-transmitted at Tehran and Karachi* the Government of India would impose a rate on the section between Karachi and the Persian frontier sufficiently high to make the secticfion that route equal to the rate charged by the Company. 11* Sir J. Bhore*s reply dated 16th August stated that the Government of India appreciated the ground for apprehension on thl part of the Company and would like to fall in with their idea if possible» On the closing down of the existing Indo route thi line between Karachi and the Persian frontier would become part of the Indian inland telegraph system as it could hardly benEi nt2ied &amp; constituted a separate telegraph administration. Bo transit charge therefore would be leviable /by India in respect of transit o er this portion of the system and under the l-stde Telegraph regulations the Government of India would be unable to adop£ » higher/ * •*© ijl) n higner terminal charge for traffic between Europe and India passing over this route than is applicable to traffic passing over route b worked by the Company* Ifoey went or* to say that when the route is closed the h&amp;r&amp;chi«»Pu£d&amp;p Boot ion iiight ue reduced to a b ingle outlet and loaintained at a standard necessary only for local traffic. It woulu therefore be uneuitable for t^ie trans^iission of international traffic and if pressed under the Convention to give facilities for international traffic on that route# the Government of Indie Vw^v would be able to reply that sufficient facilities existed ?re Buehire and the ! ulf cables. the Government of India thought that there was nothing to prevent the Communications Company fixing transit charges on the Gulf section at rates sufficiently high to stifle competition but Sir J. Bltofe suggested that it might be desirable for the Company to obtain legal advice on tnie point. air J * Bhore suggested that the foregoing might dispel the fears of the Company in respect of traffic exchanged between Karachi and the united States via Tehran wireless. He pointed out that the practice of the Government of India is to have on© uniform teriain&amp;X arid transit charge tor all traffic terminating or transmitting Bur ope hpi a higher terminal in all other cases* In the event of direct wireless working Iwlng «stabli«hed between lehran ane the Waited States of Amerloa, it woula therefore be poesibie to fcdjuet the Indian ter.dnal on traffic to Karachi ao ar, to riaJc‘: t!ie tnrouj^i rate by such route equal to the rate charged by the Coi.r wiication.

Hen Jam, Jask and Char bar, it will be open to us to take them at their word and run our cable down to the Gulf* But the effect of this would be to isolate Persia and realisation of this factC’Srhich io a valuable lever in our hands but which, because ox its possible unfortunate reactions on our negotiations generally, we do not want to use as a ho still weapon) will probably make them amenable* AS the Jask-Char bar line is an alternative to the single cable between Jask and Karachi, it is essential that the control over this should remain in our hands* But if ersia is.••.. nc i w I iiunless we are forced to 1$ * Article 4 of the Projected Anglo-Persian Telegraph Agreement, stipulates that the Persian Government will permit the operation and maintenance of British cable stations at Bushire, Eenjam, Jask and Char bar and the continuance of the Jask-Gharbar line until 1st ^iaroh, 1945. ! ?his Envisages the maintenance of the cable route for another 13 years at least and although it contains no promise that tMs will be maintained for such period,any action such as that suggested by Hr* Perry in his interview with Mr, Walton on the 31st December last (i,e* the disconnection of the Cables from Bushire and Jask) might well be regarded by Persia as a breach of the spirit, if not of the letter, of the Agreement if it is completed* The question of the removal of the cables from x i Persia, is further discussed in the Minute on P*Z*3549^31 and in *^he note of an interview with Mr* Perry on the 25th September, 1931 (flag !»• ibid)* It is understood that the suggested reference to the C.

Perry of the I.&amp;.I.G.Limited called and mentioned the follovang matters (1). It appears that Persia has entered into an agreement with Germany for wireless communica tion and that the Communications Company is consequently losing something on traffic between Europe and the East in respect of .messages sent by wireless from ItS&amp;Is. to Teneran and transmitted thence to further destinations; it nas seen suggested by some one in the Communications Company i.nao in order uo check this development a olocking rate should be charged on messages retransmitted xrom Teheran via Bushire of an amount of 40 centimes per ..vOi a in aGoioion uO me normal 58 centimes. Mr.Perry .aimselr relinks that this would be a great mistake as it 'would provoke Persia to give trouble.and one of his n v arguments that if the blocking rate is intro duced before the conclusion of the telegraph agreement with Persia it might prove a stumbling block to the conclusion of the agreement; he asked what is the position in regard to the signature of the agreement and I informed him- (2). Another suggestion made the Communications Company is that the cables should be disconnected, from Bushire Jask and that both cables (not only one as at present) should be connected to Hen jam. He did not go into details but the general result would be to disconnect the cables from the Persian main land so that the cable from Fao to Karachi would lie outside Persian territorial v/uters except at Henjarn; the Company would be aaved the expense of the landing stations at Bushire, Jask and Charbar. I said that, so far/i / main object in far as I was aware the Government, s requiring maintenance -of Persian Gull caules was oo secure cable commuii cation between Iraq and India, the question of cable :communication with the Political Resident at Bushire ym a secondary matter, proviaea always that wireless communioation with Bushire was maintained. There was, however, hie Peisian point 01 view to be considered; action of the kind suggested (which would perhaps be a breach of Art. 4 ox the agreement - Mr. Perry took the view that it would oe) would deprive Persia of any direct communication,other than wiriess,with India; if the cable communication between Persia and India were abolished it impossible to refuse to accept traffic by the central Persian land line from Persia to India; this would presumably mean the restoration of that route for international traffic which presumably would be against] the interests of the Communications Company. I under stood that Mr. Perry was in general agreement with this vie?/. (3). Mr. Perry rais ed the question of the registration of the Communications Company in Persia under the Persian law (see P.Z. 7616/31 ). I said that re would, remii i the F.O. if we did not shortly receive a iupiy u q our 1 eater of 19th December, but I suggested ; uhat it would be a good thing if he could obtain lu. tn©i particulars i.rom the Officer in Charge at Bushire as to what had. actually happened; presumably ^'d.ie -O; uuunioacion in writing had been received from wie iuls ^ an au thoriuies and it would be a good thing ur/e a copy ox it so that we might know exactly -Xn, ne matter stanas; it was possible that it was a “ lOVe part ox the local authorities taken without! ! the/ ‘ft Kt, jdr A^Jvy /'*-*&amp;*»* , aMinute Paper.

As regards the two points referred to in Mr. Lascelles* telegram No. 170 of the 2nd August (P.Z. 5022/31), we know that the question of the rates chargeable on the Persian section of the cable system was satisfactorily settled (see P.Z. 5133/31 and passage at B in the text communicated to the Persian Govt.); and it appears also from the telegram of 15th Sept, that the Persians have dropped their point about the repair of the Henjam-Bandar Abbas cable (see passage marked A in the text), since they are prepared to sign the text communicated to them, subject to four minor alterations, which seem unobjectionable. There appears to be no reason why Mr. Dodd should not be authorised to sign without further delay. 7L ^ raised,by the Persians is added, much how Wellsabad is described. P.Z. 6383 regarding one ardins one of the small points is added. It does not matter There are two matters of importance to the I. &amp; I.C.C. dealt with in recent papers ( 1 ) the difficulty of importing p .n T * on this file. their staff resulting from the worm: mri-nnnOI.V laW - 366 paTaS. difficulty of importing provisions for resulting from the working of the trade monopoly law - despatch of 9 Sept, and Mr. Sept., flagged A. This appears 9 Sept, and Mr. aiiuoj. :ed A. This appears to have been satisfactorily/satisfactorily disposed of for the time being (F.O. telegram of 26 Sept, at P.Z. 6225 and Mr. Dodd’s reply of 6 Oct. at P.Z. 6407); (2) the interpretation of the passage marked C in Article 4 of the Agreement regarding the exemption of the Company’s stores from customs duty. The question i.s what stores are covered (see Mr. Anderson’s note of 25 Sept, and Mr. Perry’s letter of 7 Oct.). The suggestion in the draft letter to the F.O. seems the best in the circumstances. It will be a relief to get the agreement signed. It will be remembered that in our agreement of August 1930 with the Company we promised 'to endeavour to secure” the landing rights &amp;c. for them by negotiation with the Persian G-ovt, whereas the Company undertook the definite obligation to maintain cable communications in the Gulf; it was contemplated that if the negotiations failed the Company could simply disconnect tne cables from the landing stations and run them up the Gulf outside Persian waters; when Mr .Perry was ne^e on 24th September, however, he stated that the cables are so old that they could not be moved about, and that failing the landing rights, it would be necessary to run new cables up the Gulf at great expense. We are under some moral obligation to the Company to secure the landing rights for them: unioiinnately it was necessary for financial reasons to transfer the inland telegraphs to Persia last spring, thus puUing them in actual possession of the main advantage which they get from the agreement before we had got the agreement signed. It would be a great mistake from the point of view of the Company and further delay in t' signature/ fromnute Paper.

I am sending a copy of this despatch to the foreim Secretary to the Government of India. I have the honour to be with the highest respect, My lord Itarquess, four Lordship’s mat obedient, humble Servant, (For His Majesty’s Charge d T Affair es ) (Signed J Lacy BaggallayElectra House, Moorgate, London, L•C• 2* 7th October, 1931• Reference !• 10,531 ♦ Dear Mr. Anderson, Many thanks for your letter of the 3rd instant* After our interview X discussed the question of the Persian Government’s objection to the admission into Persia, free of duty, of certain items on the ground that they were not covered in Article 4, with Caffcaim Lawson, and others, and the view expressed was that the Communications Company as Agent of our Government, ought to enjoy the same facilities as applied to the Indo-European Government Telegraph Department. It wasfelt that the Company, not being a party to the agreement, could not Express any definite opinion as to the advisability of re-opening negotiations in order to secure, if possible, any amendment of Articlej4. Our general feeling is, however, that if, as we now understand, the Persian Government have accented the very important points raised by the Company, it would be unwise to adopt a course of action in regard to Article 4 which would cause delay and might result in a breakdown. It was further thou^it that the course which might commend itself to you would be for the Charge to endeavour to secure, preferably in writing, a more favourable inter pretation of the wording in Article 4:- thus, I think that the word ^material” should be held to cover official stores, and as such, all requirements lor the stations -e cable* including those necessary for the reasonable well being of the Staff, such as medical necessities The Controller of Stores, to whom the list was sub mitted for corrment, remarks upon the apparently considerablenumber of new zinc baths, enamel basins, tooth brush dishes, soap dishes, jugs, indented for so soon after the Communications Company has taken over, but this of course does not affect the main question of principle vis-a-vis the Persian Government, and I must assume that these articles are part of the equipment of the station establishments, and were formerly provided by the Indo- European Telegraph Department, although perhaps it would appear that none have been imported recently. I am sure that it can reasonably be held that the free import of vegetable and flower seels, as well as brandy (which might advantageously have been described as 'medicinal brandy'), Bovril, essence of chicken, and lime juice, is as necessary now as it was in the past. It may be that cocoa and barley are obtainable locally without difficulty. As regards the 'starting' cartridges, to which objection has been taken, these are of course required in connection with starting up the oil engine# Possibly the item may have been incorrectly re’d by the Authorities as 'sporting* cartridges. Yours sincerely, (sgi) J.O. Stevens Perry. G.H.G. Anderson Esq., D.S.O., M.C.I'r.Walten. This afternoon I spoke to Mr Perry of the I @ on the telephone, and told him that the Persians are now willing to sign the agreement, subject to one or two minor alterations of drafting (as regards the Y/ords 'Gwetter (frontier)' in para 4 of article 4, it appears from Tehran despatches Nos 109 and 111 of the 11th March 1931 (p.z 2117/31 that the passage containing this phrase originated with the Persians, and I assu e. therefore, that there is no objection to the correction they no?; prfose) I asked Mr .Perry whether the I, &amp; I were willing that the agreement should be signed at once, or whether they wished us to wait, in the hope that v/e could persuade the Persians to interpret para 2 of article 4 in a rather more liberal manner. $ie said the Company had no objection to the agreement being signed at once, provided that H.M.Charge d’ Affaires was satisfied that the Perjisan Govt would permit the importation free of customs duty of all such articles as were admitted free during the regime of the I.E.T.D.

Please see previous submission dated 29th July on P. 4710/31, flagged. Je have since had considerable discussion wi hi -,i.e Conimunications Company, and also with the Persian Government. As a result, the points of difference between us and the Persian Government are now narrowed down to ore - xiiL*» 'the terms on which- the Company is to be responsible for repairs to the Henjam-Bander Abbas cable. The latest Persian proposal is that Persia should be responsiole for the cost of such repairs only to a maximum of Rs .1200 (whether per day or per occasion or per annum is not clear). The Company, Hio have gone carefully into the matter, intimate that the charter price of the cable ship would be £300 per day or part of a day, while the selling prices of the cable, if required for insertion, would range from £275.15s. per nautical mile for deep sea, to £281.10s. for intermediate, and £369 for shore end cable. After discussion with the Foreign Office, the instructions to Tehran below have been prepared. That portion of the text of the draft Agreement to be presented to the Persians which concerns the Company has now been concurred in by them. We have had no comments from th r Government of India.. But it will not be possible to present the Agreement as finally approved to the Persian Government until their concurrence has been secured, and I suggest that we might telegraph to them as in the draft now attached.IS 4116 / 10/34 0 •$•B* i-J It' a AM 5170 JL *--? ’ i 1 '..Ji - r - i • » -i J August *-# ; i 31 Mr* Dodd, Tehran* '* •«• Kapaat to XMia Ho # * * copy i.o* Your talegrara Bo. 175 Jot Augttat 9 -.tala- graphs agraomsntv* i’Tanoh taoct in your daspatoh Ho, 373 /of July k® put forward to Persian Govern- mont a© it stands, though in the absence of the |!| Sovarament of- India* a oaamenta you should explain that it has not yet been finally approved* I agree that, as suggested in paragraph 4 of your despatch, it will be preferable not to propose addition to Article 4 paragraph 5* I agree to insertion of n ov n after 'centimes' 1 , Company do not consider it feasible to fix nm: i mum sum as Persian Go varment* a liability for repair of Henjam-Bandar Abbas cable* They point out that the Persian Government seem to have no idea of coat of repairing cables* Fresh cable if required would coat from £275 to £370 par nautical mile* Charter price of cable ship is £300 a day or part of a day from Ben jam* Straight forward repair in favourable weather should be covered / ■Anmyiaso ova red by one day*s oharter charge plus cable actually 3 up pi led, You may explain this orally to Persian Government it you think it desirable.

As regards the question raised hy the Persian Government concerning the arrangement for the repair of the Hengam-Bandar Abbas cable, the view of the Company is that it is not feasible to fix a ma/srimnm sum as the Persian Government's liability. As promised, I give you the followii^ information to assist the Persian Government to form an idea of the cost of effecting a repair in normal circumstances:- Selling prioea of cable in case raquired for iaaertiQtt Shore end £369 per nautical mile. Intermediate £281.10.0 Deep Sea £275.15*0 Ihe charter-price of the cable Miip is £300 per day or part of a day. J.G.Laithwaite Esq., India Office, Whitehall, S.W.* 2 • I note that the Persians tfirink from accepting an un limited liability but it does appear to me that they have not realised the expensive nature of permanently maintaining a oable ship nor the very substantial benefit which the Company's offer means to them, namely by making no charge to the Persian Govern- 8 meat in respect of such maintainance, except for the actual period afc the ship’is occupied in the operation and no charge for the ship's journeys to the Gulf. The Company has endeavoured to meet the Persian Govemnent by charging charter-time only from the moment the ship reports at Hengam as a preliminary to proceeding to the repair ground. It does not seem feasible to undertake to submit a detailed estimate for approval before carrying out repairs costii^ more than a certain sum. The possible exceptional nature of the break and its repair might not be discovered until the ship was on the spot and her time, as well as the period of delay waiting for the Government's reply, would be lost to the Company if the Government objected to making any payment unless a repair were, in fact, effected. In the case of a straightforward repair, assuming the factor of unfavourable weather to be absent, the cost of the repair can fairly be gauged by the Persian Government from the details given above and should be covered by one day's charter- charge, plus cable actually supplied from stock.- 3 - H; ! | i In view of your views and those of the Foreign Office with regard to the 'port dues' question, I am informed by Captain Lawson that the Oommunications Company does not wish to press it at the moment. I am very much obliged by the information regarding Leases and agree that no reference thereto in the Agreement would seem to be necessary.i M Q further comrmin coimnunication on this subject, please quote No. &lt;4^ I I 0 / l 0 j ^ A v person by name, but to— and address —not to any person by name, uul iu— •‘The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. i.

Britisl Tehran July 15th, 1931 Dear Department Our despatch No.373 of to-day's date enclosing our latest draft of the Telegraphs Agreement. *ve have observed that there is no mention, in the preamble o* the draft, regarding the exchange of full powers which we believe to be usual in such instruments. Is this omission intentional or is it because Peroughi, if he signs for the Persian Government, recgiires no full powers being Minister for Foreign Affairs? In that case should Dodd present his full powers unilaterally? Would you, if necessary, kindly draft the usual clause for insertion? We notice that there are three governments signatory, but only two parties to the agreement and only two copies of it. Furthermore, ratifications are said to be ’'deposited' and not 'exchanged.' Are we to conclude that there will be three instruments of ratification? If there are only to be two instruments of ratification, surely these should be exchanged and not deposited at Tehran, the Persian instrument of ratification being sent home to you, and the joint British and Indian instrument of ratification retained here by the Persians after exchange? One other point. Your telegram No.43 of April 1st says 'Ratification clause should refer to the three governments ' Does the clause in the draft enclosed in our despatch under reference adequately carry out these instructions? If not, would you kindly provide us with a correct text? Yours ever. ^ern Department ' h e Foreign Office Chancery.

Mr. Hibberdine is away for a week so that it is difficult for me to say finally that we have no comment to offer concerning the draft of Clause 4 of the Telegraph Agreement as presented by H.M. Charge d’Affaires in Teheran to the Persian Cxovemment, although it appears to me to cover the views put forward by us at the meeting on the 15th June. From the Indian Government’s point of view, I am not quite sure whether, in the 4th clause, it is entirely correct to reserve to the Persian Government the right to establish their station at Gwattar. Is not that station staffed at present by the Indian TeL (Baluchistan) ? J. G. Lai thwai te Esq., India Office, Whitehall. SJEWe have not, of course, seen the full Telegraph Agreement and are not acquainted, at any rate in London, with details as to which are the cable stations formerly owned by the Indo-European Deaprtment and which are merely leased, nor the teras of such leases (see Sehedule of Assets trasnferred to I. &amp; I.C.). Perhaps provision may have been made in the Agreement as to these leases; we diould like to feel assured that the liability of I. &amp; I.C. for rentals is fixed. Another point has just occurred to me.* Is there any provision for exemption of the cable ship from port dues?

If the ^oreign 0ff lce agree as to this, the Government of India can most conveniently be brought in by a uelegram to Teneran repeated to India, and approving the text subject to ary ooseivauions the Government of India niay telegraph to the Charge d’Affaires. As regards the point raised in paragraph 3 of Mr. Dodd ’s despatch, the draft seems generally suitable. Hie point raised in paragraph 4 is more difficult. There is, I think, force m the Charge d’Affaires’ suggestion that there would be some advantage from the point of vie?/ of tie Company in retaining the original wording (with a consequential redrafting). But on the whole I doubt if it is worth reopening the question at the stage matters have now reached. As Mr. Dodd points out, we could not do so without a substantial redrafting of the paragraph, and this would raise points by no means unlikely to give rise to difficulties ?dth the Persian authorities. It is most important from our point of view, particularly in view of the continued deterioration in our relations with Persia, to get this agreement signed and out of the way, and I submit that we should do best to leave matters as they are. Foreign Office, with whom the point has been discussed, are disposed to agree.

I think the alterations are generally suitable, and submit that I may reply to hr. Baxter as in the draft attached.1 f linute Paper. Department. 49U 5000 5/30 The French text of the draft Telegraph Agreement presented to the Persian Government last May is enclosed in Sir Robert Clive’s despatch of 20th May, ho. 251, on P.Z. 3550/31. The Minister, in his covering despatch, drew attention to certain defects or ambiguities in the text. These were the subject of discussion with the Communications Company at the meeting presided over by Sir Louis Kershaw on 15th June, as the result of which general agreement was reached as to the line to be taken in respect of them. The Foreign Office now invite our concurrence in'a memorandum on the subject to be sent to Sir Robert Clive. ■ The following comments are offered on the amendments suggested in the Foreign Office memorandum. 1. p reamble. line 2 .-- This is merely drafting. ho objection. 2. Article 4. mxa -,_l,- See on this Sir Robert Clive's comrnents in paragraph 2 of his despatch of 20th flay. We may concur m the proposed omission of the words ’'continue . 3. ftrt,iole h. para. 5 .- As the Foreign Oifice say, the revised offer made by the Communications Company as the result of the meeting of 15th June arc embodied in paragraph 4 of the Foreign Office telegram to Tehran No. 95, of 17th J aiv , on P.Z. 3889/31, will necessitate a general redrafting. On the two minor questions, however, which, as the Foreign Office say, it is possible to dispose of immediately, the interpretation of the words 'Persian/'Persian Government local traffic' set out in their memorandum now submitted was accepted by the Company at th|&lt; meeting of 15th June. The arguments given m support of it will be useful to Sir Robert Clive, and the Foreign Office have taken the opportunity to emphasise the importance of treating the cable system as entirely separate from the Persian system and warning the Minister that it must be our aim to emphasise this and to be on our guard against any Persian effort to establish a claim to the cables between Bushire and Charbar. The meeting of 15th June agreed to the of the qualifying words 'entre Fao et Karachi'. The Company were indeed anxious that the whole sentence in which they^occur ('il ne dev|ra . . . reseau') should be omitted, but on the whole it may perhaps be simpler to leave things as they are rather than start a discussion with the Persians on the question of omission or retention. Article 4 f para. 6.- See on this paragraph 5 of Sir Robert Clive’s despatch 251 of 20th May. The Minister’s view may be accepted.

T) : Points raised by H.M. Minister, Tehran, in connection with wording of dra.xo .telegraph Agreement.Sir Louis Kershaw. I attach a copy of an Agenda paper for this afternoon. Sir M. Simpson is coming. I also attach a note jusl received from tne Conmunications Company of the line they propose to take. Much of it is technical and I will not comment on it, but I offer the following observations on the points for discussion. (a) Baint., ,1 Qn Agenda Use of o^lee.- The Persians have again demanded the use of the cables for fixed daily periods, alleging that they had such an arrangement with the I.E.I.D. before the Kirrnan-Bander Abbas line was built. Sir Li. Simpson has no recollection of any such arrangement, and thinks it most unlikely, since operation of cables needs special instruments which, so far as he knows, the Persians never possessed. It is possible that the explanation may be that the instruments in question were lent them by the Department. Subject to any further information which may become available as to the alleged arrangement, we might reply to the Persians that the Company are unable to agree to the use of their cables. Play might be made, in this connection, ; with the concession offered by the Company under (b) below. (b) The Company, as a special concession to Persia, agreed to carry Government traffic free on the Gulf cables, and other local traffic at rates equal to half the notified Gulf rates in force on 1st March, 1931. They further agrea{not to increase these rates except as part of a general increase affecting all sections of the line in the same proportion. This is a substantial concession, but the Persians are not satisfied with it, on the ground that M in the case of ordinary internal messages half the Gulf rates amounts to 30 shahis a word, whereas if the cables vrere worked by the Persians/t£&gt; Persians themselves for internal messages they would be transmitted at internal rates, which mean 10 shahis a word. The Persian Administration would in that case get the whole of the 10 shahis, whereas if the Cable Company did the traffic it would get for itself the whole of the 30 snahis and the Persians would get nothing in spit e of t:ie fact unat it was purely local traffic'. The Company point out (Sir M. Simpson agrees) that it would be unreasonable to expect cables communications to operate as cheaply as do local land wires. Their capital cost and manipulation precludes this. No averaging process is possible for the Company, as would perhaps be the case with a country operating both cables and overland wires. But the Company are prepared to make a further concession, and agree to a flat charge of 20 centimes extending to the l entire length Bushire-Charbar and to halve these 20 centimes with the Persian Government, on condition that the Persian Government withdraws its proposal to be given the actual user of the cables. The Company would charge (and retain) a further 20 centimes for the sections Bushire-Fao and Jask-Gwadur or Jask-Karachi. The Persians would use their own discretion as to what additional rates they would charge for the inland Persian transmission outside Bushire and Jask. Sir M. Simpson will be able to advise on this. Prima facie it seems to offer a possible way out. (c) Hor,iam- Bander Abbas,._cefoLa ■ - The Persians claim that the I.E.T.D. formerly bore half the cost of repairs. They want the Company to do the same. The answer is tnat the Department bore this charge because it received a share of the Persian terminal rate and that, as trie Persians will henceforth receive the whole of the terminal rate, it IS but fair that they should bear the cost of maintenance The/The Company is already going some way to meet the Persians by offering to undertake the repairs as their agents, on ! repayment. (d) The Persians claim a transit tax of 44 centimes gold in respect of international traffic passing over the cables touching their territory at Bushire ana Jask. Sir Maurice Simpson advises that this claim is technically justified. The reply proposed by the Company is given on page 3 of their note attached. They suggest a reasoned answer, coupled with the threat of taking one .Sable, oqt Qf ,£e£sj, a p territory ^.nd working het.w^p Fas-Ggadur or...Fao-Karachi fpr the ournnse of tins on p&amp;imian territory . I chink we may agree to try a reasoned remonstrance on the Persians, possibly with a threat of this nature, in tne first instance. But the Company's offer may make it possible to ascertain their views on the question of removing the cables altogether and_substituting wireless. The other l/Eems on the Agenda are of subordinate importance, and you may not think it necessary to wait for their discussion. IS l/t -&gt;/p.Z. 3737/31.

(Initialled) O.T.E. £6th May, 1931.Please see Sir Robert Clive's telegram of 27th May P*Z. 3417, my letter of 30th May to Sir Maurice Simpson, ilaggea, and his reply of 2nd June, also flagged, on the subject of the further concessions which the Persian uoveinmeno are anxious to extract from us as a condition of the signature of the Telegraph Agreement. Sir Maurice Simpson's letter puts us, I think, m a position to reply satisfactorily to the Persians on the first three points raised by them ((a), (b) and (c) in paragraph 3 of my letter of 30th May), though it would be desirable to consult with the Communications Company as to the terms of the reply to be given on point (b). As regards point (d) , the position is very difficult. It seems clear that the Persians are within their rights in claiming a transit fee on telegrams between Iraq and India. On the other hand, the effect of pressing this claim might not only be to make the financial already is, but also, if one result is a substantial increase in the cost of telegrams travelling by this route, to expose us to commercial criticism. Subject to the result of the discussion with the Communications Company, I think our best line would be to instruct Sir iiobero Clive (if the loxeign Office agree) to use his best endeavours to get the Persians to drop this particular claim. He might admit that it was theoretically justified, but he could make play with the fact that it would impose a heavy additional burden on the company and that the danger that it might be impossible for them to carry on could not be overlooked. While negotiations on these lines were going on it would be possible for us to investigate closely the major question raised by Sir Maurice Simpson and/ moreand dealo with in the following paragraphs of the removal of the cables from Persia. The Foreign Office, with whom the matter has been discussed informally, are departmentally inclined to agree witn the line suggested above. The Government of India cable Karachi-Bushire-Fao (for Basra) calling at Jask was scheduled by the Imperial Communications Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence in 1928 as a cable of strategic importance, the maintenance of which was necessary in order to meet requirements in the event of operations in the Persian Gulf. In view of this we have secured from the Communications Company an agreement to main tain it as part of their general settlement with us. Sir Maurice Simpson now suggests that in view of the ^ difficulties raised by the Persians, the C.I.D. might be asked whether they remain of the same opinion as in 1928. He suggests as an alternative wireless communication based on the stations in Iraq, at Karachi and at Bahrein, which could be made to communicate with each other at little expense (the Bahrein station would, of course, have to be entirely modernised); the establishment of a new station at Muscat; and the establishment by Pers.ia, if sue wanted to communicate by wireless with India, of stations of her own. The alternatives open to us are - (a) to acquiesce in whatever terms Persia may impose as condition of the retention of our landing rights at Bushiie, Jask and Henjam. The J-wlftT would fall on the Company. Buo we should certainly receive appeals to which it would be difficult not to respond from them if the result of acceptance of these conditions in our inteiesu Ww substantially to worsen their financial position. (b) to take out the cables from the Persian ports, maintaining/t WO* ^ ^ ^ - 7 '' k.'' I imintaining the cable but running it doim the middle of the Gulf (perhaps with stopping points at Tarnb or Abu Musa) and possibly supplemented by a modernised Bahrein wireless station and a wireless station a.t Muscat. Removal of the cable would certainly be an expensive matter for the Company, and here again some difficulty with them might be anticipated if we endeavoured to hold them to the terns of their bargain. (c) to remove the cables altogether, relying entirely on wireless. This would be very satisfactory from the point of view of the Company, but we should have carefully to ^ hiu consider our own interests in the matter. If it were to be is ^ ^ .&gt; V adopted, we could, I think, reasonably press the Company to n*** ^ V o-f tK ^ .^sree^to modernise the Bahrein station and to build us a ^ y' s’ wireless station at Muscat in addition to carrying, as '■“t '( S A y ; suggested by Sir Maurice Simpson, payment of compensation to ^^ [A the cable staff. ^ \ ^ ( )y // The question as a whole is both important and very m a A /} A lu J sLr~h. 1—^ ^•vU- ^ Ca ^- *'*' b ‘CJsojJL, ^ technical. It has been discussed informally with the Foreign Office, who are disposed to agree with Sir Maurice Simpson that the best thing would be to put the alternatives before the C.I.D. and get a ruling from them. In the light of that ruling we could then decide whether to abandon the cables | and go at once for a wireless scheme in the Gulf, or to use the threat of such a scheme to Persia, maintaining ^ne cables i if she gives way. Our position yhs.-^-yis Persia would certainly be much stronger were we in a position to use such a ^ nr cat, and I think it would certainly be worth exploring the situation again with the assistance of the C.I.D. But the C.I.D. cannot be expected to reach a decision on a point of this nature without a full statement of the technical and ocnei problems 1 involved, and an examination of the probable expense of the W* ... i ' i WM f modernisation/ Vf ^ modernisation of the Bahrein wireless station and the installation of a new station at Muscat. Moreover, if we are to be able to turn the threat of withdrawing our stations to advantage in the near future, as would be desirable, it would be essential to put proposals before the yi^ C.I.D. in the very near future. This Department is hardly 1 ^ ^ ^^quipped for dealing with questions of this nature and if, ^ after consideration, reference to the G.I.D. is decided on, it is for consideration whether it rni^it not be possible to secure Sir 'Eaurice Simpson's services m connection with it7 - But perhaps the matter might be discussed orally before any decision is taken? Meanwhile, if you agree, arrangements , can be made for a meeting here with representatives of the 1 'V'V. 4 ^ . ^ Communications Company to discuss the terms of the reply to UiVLv(. t ■ r * 1^ ^ K 7 fc, -ft be given to Sir Robert Clive's telegram of 27th May. Nothing would, of course, be said to them oi the possibility of pulling up the cable. ‘Jyfi .LoXihj***!*r S i' P. ? 354 ^ ! 9 31 27, Egerton Hoad, Sexhill- on-Sea, 2nd June, 1931 /3 Dear Laitnwaite, *7f*j £Fo l {bOfi&amp;tJfcAj I am sorry I could not answer yours of the 30th May yesterday hut I was away for the day. r ara also sorry to see that the Persians are still proving so difficult. (a) So far as I am aware the Persian Ministry of Pofts were never allowed to use the Gulf cables for fixed daily periods. I feel certain this is so as the warding of the cables required special instruments which the Persians never possessed. (To) Perhaps the position would be clearer if Slocornbe drew up a table showing what the local rates concerned were before the 1st March last and what they would be under the draft agreement. Under the latter there would be a Persian terminal and a Gulf cable charge and with a reasonable terminal rate for Persia, and half the cable rate the total should not be excessive. The Persians must be made to understand that traffic cannot be carried by cables at the low rates which are suitable for land lines. (c) The Department shared the cost of maintenance of the v Henjam Bunder Abbas line with Persia. It must be remembered however that the Department received a share of the Persian terminal rate and it was in return for this we shared the maintenance. As the Persians will henceforth receive the whole of the terminal rate it is hut fair they should hear the cost of maintenance. (d) The Persians can claim a transit fee on telegrams between Iraq and India. The question never arose in the past hut we should no douht have claimed that Persia had compounded for all her transit fees for international traffic. At the . • • qtrictlv to claim this transit- present time Persia is entitled stnc^iy rate/rate. The only course to take is to get the Persians to abandon the claim or raise the Iraq-India rates to cover it. All the rates from Iraq to India and beyond would have to ' be increased. The position being so difficult I think it might be worth while to ask the Committee of Imperial Defence whether they consider it is really necessary for strategic reasons to maintain the Gulf cables. A good deal has happened since that decision was taken and it may be that now they would be satisfied with wireless communication. If so there would be considerable advantage in abandoning the cables, which can never pay for the cost of upkeep, and adopting a wireless scheme of communication. The nucleus of such a scheme already exists in the stations in Iraq, at liar a chi and Bahrein* These could all be made to communicate with each other at little expense. A station would have to be provided at Muscat, and Persia would have to provide stations for communication with India. I think this avenue is worth exploring as a possibility before making any threat to Persia. In case of the removal of the cables there is no obligation for India to provide any special route for international traffic. It would be for India to consider whether it would be desirable to keep up a route for direct communication by wire or to rely on wireless. The abandonment of the cables would be very welcome to the Communications Company and we might well ask for some quid pro quo, i.e. payment of compensation to the cable staft. I suggest therefore that we first endeavour to ootain the acquiescence of the C.I.D. to the abandonment of the cables* If that is obtained it can then be decided whether (a)(a) to go at once for a wireless scheme for the Gulf and abandon the cables or (b) Aether to use such a scheme threat to Persia and, if she gives way, to maintain the cables.

I do not quite understand the Persian complaint that 'charges w-quldj be excessive and the Persian Goverrrnent receive nothing” in respect of local non-Governmental traffic under this arrangement. SI ocombe, whom I consulted/’ - ■ - :onsulted, notes as follows:- H The local rate between Persia and places in the Gulf would be made up of the Persian terminal charge plus the Company’s cable charge. As the Company agree to take half the ordinary cable charge, it is for Persia to reduce their terminal charge to bring the total charge down to what they think it should be. In this connection I think the term 'Local Traffic' should be defined with precision'. I understand from SIocombe that Persia would continue to receive her own terminal charge in any case. But we should be grateful for your observations on the question generally (c) The Persian Government are, I think, correct in stating that the cost of repairs to the Henjam/feunder Abbas cable was previously shared equally between the I.E.T.D. and the Persian Government ? (d) We should be grateful for your ooservations on the Persian claim to a transit fee on telegrams between Iraq and India and on the statement that this right was ceded in the past to the I.E.T.D. for a payment of £5,400 annually. Slocombe not83 on this point as follows:- ’Traffic between Iraq and India passed over the Gulf cables which go m and out of Bushire.

But it has no connection with Iraq Indian traffic.' ^ I assume that we should in the last resort be free to threaten the t Persian Government, if this were considered free from political objection, in the event of a complete deadlock being reached, with withdrawal of the cable stations from Persia (though we should of course be extremely reluctant to use or to have to implement such a threat).

It has, therefore been omitted from the French translation, but can be The Hight Honourable Arthur Henderson, M.P., The Foreign office.restored If considered necessary. In Article 4, paragraph 5, doubt arose as to the meaning of the words 'Persian Government local traffic' - whether they meant official messages passing only between local authorities from one point to another on the system worked by the Agent; or whether 'local traffic' means internal Persian traffic &amp;&amp; opposed to international and may originate from and be destined for any point a in Persia, no matter whether on the Agent*# ays tern or not# for example, from Tehran to Bander Abbas via Bushire. The former meaning is assumed in the enclosed French text; the latter may be rendered: 'L*agent ee chargors do la transmission 'a titre gratuit des t4legrammes off iciels du 'Gouvemoment Perean a destination interieure, et 'pre^vera aur d-autrea co^unlcationa interieure.

At the end of this paragraph, 'all sections of the lines' appeared to require closer definition, if it la intended to mean# not all the lines operated by the Communications Company all over the world, but merely the Persian half lines* I suggest, therefore, that at the end of trie paragraph in the French version# after *.*. fcoutes lea sections du reseau* should be added some such qualification as; 'entre F&amp;o et Karachi'* At the beginning of paragraph 6 of Article 4, tli® enclosed French translation represents the. text a# amended in accordance with your tele gram &gt;lo* 71.
