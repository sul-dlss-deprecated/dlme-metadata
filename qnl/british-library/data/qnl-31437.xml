The Director of Posts and Telegraphs, Sind &amp; Baluchistan Circle, (Indo-Buropean Telegraph Section) Karachi. Sir, I have the honour to refer you to the up-keep of the Gwudur Cemetry which was formerly maintained under the orders of the Director, Persian Gulf Telegraphs (Indo- Buropean Telegraph Section). 2. No file in this connection was handed over with chose files i*emitted by you to this office last year and no relative papers exist in this office. 3. During my recent visit to Gwadur I found the Christian cemetry in a deplorable condition of neglect though apparently a small sum for maintenance has continued to be placed annually at the disposal of the Telegraph Master, Gwadur, for the purpose. 4. It is not knov/n from where xhese funds are made available but ao the same time it seems that the restoration and future maintenance of the graves and cemetry confines is most desirable* 5. If you can transfer the available grants to me annually 1 am prepared to undertake the work with your concurrence, and I should be glad to have your early views on the subject.1 i “f Ho. / of 19f4.
