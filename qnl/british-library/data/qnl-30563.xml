Hon. Earl Peel, G.C.S.I., G.B.E. (Chairman). Rt. Hon. Sir Horace Rumbold, Bart., G.C.B., G.C.M.G., M.V.O. (Vice-Chairman). Sir Laurie Hammond, K.C.S.I., C.B.E. Sir Morris Carter, C.B.E. Sir Harold Morris, M.B.E., K.C. Professor Reginald Coupland, C.I.E. Mr. J. M. Martin was Secretary. The Commission was appointed in August, 1936, with the following terms of reference :— To ascertain the underlying causes of the disturbances which broke out in Palestine in the middle of April ; to enquire into the manner in which the Mandate for Palestine is being implemented in relation to the obligations of the Mandatory towards the Arabs and the Jews respectively ; and to ascertain whether, upon a proper construction of the terms of the Mandate, either the Arabs or the Jews have any legitimate grievances on account of the way in which the Mandate has been or is being implemented ; and if the Commission is satisfied that any such grievances are well-founded, to make recommendations for their removal and for the prevention of their recurrence. The following is a summary of the Commission’s Report :— SUMMARY PART I : THE PROBLEM Chapter I.—The Historical Background A brief account of ancient Jewish times in Palestine, of the Arab conquest and occupation, of the dispersion of the Jews and the development of the “ Jewish Problem,” and the growth and meaning of Zionism. B* (C26050)4 Chapter II.—The War and the Mandate In order to obtain Arab support in the War, the British Govern ment promised the Sherif of Mecca in 1915 that, in the event of an Allied victory, the greater part of the Arab provinces of the Turkish Empire would become independent. The Arabs understood that Palestine would be included in the sphere of independence. In order to obtain the support of World Jewry, the British Government in 1917 issued the Balfour Declaration. The Jews understood that, if the experiment of establishing a Jewish NationJ[ Home succeeded and a sufficient number of Jews went to Palestine/ the National Home might develop in course of time into a Jewish State. At the end of the War, the Mandate System was accepted by the Allied and Associated Powers as the vehicle for the execution of the policy of the Balfour Declaration, and, after a period of delay, the Mandate for Palestine was approved by the League of Nations and the United States. The Mandate itself is mainly concerned with specific obligations of equal weight—positive obligations as to the establishment of the National Home, negative obligations as to safeguarding the rights of the Arabs. The Mandate also involves the general obligation, implicit in every Mandate, to fulfil the primary purpose of the Mandate System as expressed in the first paragraph of Article 22 of the Covenant. This means that “ the well-being and development ” of the people concerned are the first charge on the Mandatory, and implies that they will in due course be enabled “ to stand by themselves.” The association of the policy of the Balfour Declaration with the Mandate System implied the belief that Arab hostility to the former would presently be overcome, owing to the economic advantages which Jewish immigration was expected to bring to Palestine a whole. Chapter HI—Palestine from 1920 to 1936 During the first five years of the Civil Administration, which was set up in 1920, a beginning was made on the one hand with the provision of public services, which mainly affected the Arab majority of the population, and on the other hand with the establishment of the Jewish National Home. There were outbreaks of disorder in 1920 and 1921, but in 1925 it was thought that the prospects of ultimate harmony between the Arabs and the Jews seemed so favourable that the forces for maintaining order were substantially reduced. These hopes proved unfounded because, although Palestine as a whole became more prosperous, the causes of the outbreaks of 1920 and 1921, namely, the demand of the Arabs for national independenceand their antagonism to the National Home, remained unmodified and were indeed accentuated by the “ external factors, namely, the pressure of the Jews of Europe on Palestine and the development of Arab nationalism in neighbouring countries. By These same causes brought about the outbreaks of 1929 and 1933. 1936 the external factors had been intensified by— (1) the sufferings of the Jews in Germany and Poland, resulting in a great increase of Jewish immigration into Palestine ; and (2) the prospect of Syria and the Lebanon soon obtaining the same independence as ‘Iraq and Saudi-Arabia. Egypt was also on the eve of independence. Chapter IV.—The Disturbances of 1936 These “ disturbances ” (which are briefly summarized) were similar in character to the four previous outbreaks, although more serious and prolonged. As in 1933, it was not only the Jews who were attacked, but the Palestine Government. A new feature was the part played by the Rulers of the neighbouring Arab States in bringing about the end of the strike. The “ underlying causes of the disturbances ” of 1936 were— (1) the desire of the Arabs for national independence ; (2) their hatred and fear of the establishment of the Jewish National Home. These two causes were the same as those of all the previous outbreaks and have always been inextricably linked together. Of several subsidiary factors, the more important were— (1) the advance of Arab nationalism outside Palestine ; ^ (2) the increased immigration of Jews since 1933 ; (3) the opportunity enjoyed by the Jews for influencing _ public opinion in Britain ; (4) Arab distrust in the sincerity of the British Government; (5) Arab alarm at the continued Jewish purchase of land ; (6) the general uncertainty as to the ultimate intentions of the Mandatory Power. Chapter V.—The Present Situation The Jewish National Home is no longer an experiment. The growth of its population has been accompanied by political, social and economic developments along the lines laid down at the outset. The chief novelty is the urban and industrial development. Ihe contrast between the modern democratic and primarily European (C26050) b* 2character of the National Home and that of the Arab world around it is striking. The temper of the Home is strongly nationalist. There can be no question of fusion or assimilation between Jewish and Arab cultures. The National Home cannot be half-national. Crown Colony government is not suitable for such a highly educated, democratic community as the National Home and fosters an unhealthy irresponsibility. The National Home is bent on forcing the pace of its development not only because of the desire of the Jews to escape from Europ^ but because of anxiety as to the future in Palestine. The Arab population shows a remarkable increase since 192|^ and it has had some share in the increased prosperity of Palestil?. Many Arab landowners have benefited from the sale of land and the profitable investment of the purchase money. The fellaheen are better off on the whole than they were in 1920. This Arab progress has been partly due to the import of Jewish capital into Palestine and other factors associated with the growth of the National Home. In particular, the Arabs have benefited from social services which could not have been provided on the existing scale without the revenue obtained from the Jews. Such economic advantage, however, as the Arabs have gained from Jewish immigration will decrease if the political breach between the races continues to widen. Arab nationalism is as intense a force as Jewish. The Arab leaders’ demand for national self-government and the shutting down of the Jewish National Home has remained unchanged since 1920. Like Jewish nationalism, Arab nationalism is stimulated by the educational system and by the growth of the Youth Movement. It has also been greatly encouraged by the recent Anglo-Egyptian and Franco-Syrian Treaties. A I he gulf between the races is thus already wide and will contimi^] to widen if the present Mandate is maintained. The position of the Palestine Government between the two antagonistic communities is unenviable. There are two rival bodies—the Arab Higher Committee allied with the Supreme Moslem Council on the one hand, and the Jewish Agency allied with the \ a ad Leumi on the other—who make a stronger appeal to the natural loyalty of the Arabs and the Jews than does the Government of Palestine. The sincere attempts of the Government to treat the two races impartially have not improved the relations between them. Nor has the policy of conciliating Arab opposition been successful. The events of last year proved that conciliation is useless. The evidence submitted by the Arab and Jewish leaders respect ively was directly conflicting and gave no hope of compromise.(C26050) B * 3 no) The only solution of the problem put forward by the Arab Higher Committee was the immediate establishment of an independent Arab Government, which would deal with the 400,000 Jews now in Palestine as it thought fit. To that it is replied that belief in British good faith would not be strengthened anywhere in the world if the National Home were now surrendered to Arab rule. The Jewish Agency and the Va’ad Leumi asserted that the problem would be solved if the Mandate were firmly applied in full ^|ccordance with Jewish claims: thus there should be no new irestriction on immigration nor anything to prevent the Jewish population becoming in course of time a majority in Palestine. To 'r Akit it is replied that such a policy could only be maintained by mrce and that neither British public opinion nor that of World Jewry is likely to commit itself to the recurrent use of force unless it is convinced that there is no other means by which justice can be done. PART II : THE OPERATION OF THE MANDATE The Commission exhaustively considered what might be done in one field after another in execution of the Mandate to improve the prospects of peace. The results of this enquiry are embodied in Part II of the Report. The problems confronting the various branches of the Mandatory Administration are described, and the grievances of the Arabs and Jews under each head discussed. The principal findings of the Commission are as follows :— 0 ^ Chapter VI.—Administration A The Palestinian officers in the Government Service work well in normal times, but in times of trouble they are unreliable. There should be no hesitation in dispensing with the services of those whose loyalty or impartiality is uncertain. As regards British officers, the cadre is too small to admit of a Civil Service for Palestine alone and the Administration must con tinue to draw on the Colonial Service, but the ordinary period of service in Palestine should be not less than seven years. Officers should be carefully selected and given a preliminary course of instruction. The Commission recognise the difficulties of the British Adminis tration, driven from the first to work at high pressure with no opportunity for calm reflection. There is over-centralization and insufficient liaison between Headquarters Departments and the District Administration..8 The grievances and claims of the Arabs and Jews as regards the Courts cannot be reconciled and reflect the racial antagonism pervading the whole Administration. The difficulty of providing a judicial system suitable to the needs of the mixed peoples of Palestine is enhanced by the existence of three official languages, three weekly days of rest, three sets of official holidays and three systems of law. As regards Jewish suspicions as to the conduct of criminal prosecutions, the Commission point to the difficulties of the Legal Department in a land where perjury is common and evident^ in many cases unobtainable, and conclude that the animosity between the two races, particularly in times of crisis, has shown its influence to the detriment of the work of the Departmeakp^, The appointment of a British Senior Government Advocated recommended. The Jaffa-Haifa road should be completed as speedily as possible. Further expert enquiry is necessary before deciding whether a second deep-water port is required. It would be best to build such a port, if at all, at the junction of Jaffa and Tel Aviv, equally accessible from each. There is no branch of the Administration with which the Jewish Agency does not concern itself, but the Agency is not open to criticism on this ground. Article 4 of the Mandate entitles it to advise and co-operate with the Government in almost anything that may affect the interests of the Jewish population. It constitutes a kind of parallel government existing side by side with the Mandatory Government and its privileged position intensifies Arab antagonism. The Arab Higher Committee was to a large extent responsible for maintaining and protracting the strike last year. The Mufti of Jerusalem as President must bear his due share of responsibility. It is unfortunate that since 1929 no action has been practicable^) regulate the question of elections for the Supreme Moslem County^ and the position of its President. The functions which the MuL*' has collected in his person and his use of them have led to the development of an Arab imperiam in imperio. He may be described as the head of a third parallel government. The Commission discuss a proposal for an enlarged Arab Agency, consisting of repre sentatives of neighbouring Arab countries as well as of the Arabs in Palestine, to balance the Jewish Agency. If the present Mandate system continues some such scheme will have to be considered. Chapter VII.—Public Security Although expenditure on public security rose from £265,000 in 1923 to over £862,000 in 1935-36 (and £2,230,000 in 1936-37, the year of the disturbances), it is evident that the elementary duty of(C26050) B * 4 rw 9 providing public security has not been discharged. Should disorders break out again of such a nature as to require the intervention of the Military, there should be no hesitation in enforcing martial law throughout the country under undivided military control. In such an event disarmament should be enforced and an effective frontier organization established for stopping smuggling, illegal immigration and gun running. In the absence of disarmament the supernumerary police for the defence of Jewish Settlements should be continued as disciplined force. The collection of intelligence was unsatisfactory during the ^^^ike. The majority of Palestinian officers in the Criminal Investi- *'^^tion Department are thoroughly devoted and loyal, but the junior ranks, like the majority of the District police, though useful in times of peace, are unreliable in time of trouble. It would be highly dangerous to expose the Arab police of Palestine to another strain of the same kind as that which they endured last summer. In “ mixed ” areas British District Officers should be appointed. Central and local police reserves are necessary. A large mobile mounted force is also essential, whether in the form of a Gendarmerie or by increasing the British Mounted Police. After the 1929 disturbances, though 27 capital sentences were confirmed, only three murderers suffered the extreme penalty. In 1936 there were 260 reported cases of murder, 67 convictions and no death sentences. The prompt and adequate punishment of crime is a vital factor in the maintenance of law and order. Collective fines totalling over £60,000 were imposed during the years 1929-36 : only £18,000 has been collected up to date. If collective fines are to have a deterrent effect they should be limited sum that can be realized, and a body of punitive police should quartered on the town or village until the fine has been paid. The penalties provided by the Press Ordinance and the action taken under it are insufficient. An Ordinance should be adopted providing for a cash deposit which can be confiscated and for imprisonment as well as payment of a fine ; also, in case of a repeti tion of the offence, for forfeiture of the press. Police barracks and married quarters are urgently necessary in certain towns. The entire cost of the measures proposed could not be met from the revenues of Palestine. Grants-in-aid from His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom would be required on a generous scale. The immediate effect of these measures would be to widen the gulf that separates the Arab from the Jew, with repercussions spreading far beyond the borders of Palestine.Chapter VIII.- Financial and Fiscal Questions Until recent years the public finances allowed no great scope for development in the social services. The accumulation of a considerable surplus was a feature of the four years beginning 1932, and there were grounds for a conservative attitude towards this development. The conclusion that the existence of a large surplus reflects undue parsimony is not borne out by close analysis, since the entire surplus is found to be so heavily mortgaged that it i: little more than a reasonable provision for existing commitment^ If the inward flow of capital, which is the most singular feature of the economy of Palestine, were to be arrested, there is no reason why the removal of exceptional advantages should result in pem^-* though there might be some reduction in the standard of livrfig until the new economy was established. In the event of a prolonged period of economic stagnation the danger of an exodus of capital cannot be altogether excluded. It is not possible in the absence of adequate statistics to measure the truth of the Arab complaint that industrial protection chiefly benefits the Jews and that its burdens are chiefly borne by the Arabs. It is hoped that the new Department of Statistics may soon enquire into the incidence of taxation and that new duties will be considered in relation to the whole burden of taxation and not merely as affecting the particular industry. There is no question of the need of increasing the export trade and finding markets for the ever increasing citrus output. After examining various possible expedients for overcoming the difficulties which result from the non-discrimination in tariff policy required by Article 18 of the Mandate, the Commission conclude that the provisions of Article 18 are out of date. Without an amendment of that Article Palestine must continue to suffer from the restrictions which hamper international trade, and negotiations should^be opened without delay to put the trade of Palestine on a fairer bR^ Chapter IX.—The Land A summary of land legislation enacted during the Civil Adminis tration shows the efforts made to fulfil the Mandatory obligation in this matter. The Commission point to serious difficulties in connection with the legislation proposed by the Palestine Government for the protection of small owners. The Palestine Order in Council and, if necessary, the Mandate should be amended to permit of legislation empowering the High Commissioner to prohibit the transfer of land in any stated area to Jews, so that the obligation to safeguard the rights and position of the Arabs may be carried out. Until survey and settlement are complete, the Commission would welcome the prohibition of the sale of isolated and comparatively small plots of land to Jews. They would prefer larger schemes for there-arrangement of proprietorship under Government supervision. They favour the proposal for the creation of special Public Utility Companies to undertake such development schemes subject to certain conditions. An expert Committee should be appointed to draw up a Land Code. Recommendations are made with a view to the expediting of settlement (the need for which is paramount) and to the improvement settlement procedure. The present system of Land Courts is contributory to delay. Hatil survey and settlement are complete there should be two or r®*ee Land Courts separate from the District Courts and each under a single British Judge. Up till now the Arab cultivator has benefited on the whole both from the work of the British Administration and the presence of Jews in the country, but the greatest care must now be exercised to see that in the event of further sales of land by Arabs to Jews the rights of any Arab tenants or cultivators are preserved. Thus, alienation of land should only be allowed where it is possible to replace extensive by intensive cultivation. In the hill districts there can be no expectation of finding accommodation for any large increase in the rural population. At present, and for many years to come, the Mandatory Power should not attempt to facilitate the close settlement of the Jews in the hill districts generally. The shortage of land is due less to purchase by Jews than to the increase in the Arab population. The Arab claims that the Jews have obtained too large a proportion of good land cannot be maintained. Much of the land now carrying orange groves was sand dunes or swamps and uncultivated when it was bought. ^Legislation vesting surface water in the High Commissioner is -ntial. An increase in staff and equipment for exploratory •Wstigations with a view to increasing irrigation is recommended. The scheme for the development of the Huleh district is com mended. The Commission fully realize the desirability of afforestation on a large scale and of a long term forest policy, but, having regard to their conclusion as to the scarcity of land in the hills for the agri cultural population, they cannot recommend a policy involving expropriation of cultivators on a large scale until other cultivable land or suitable employment on the land can be found for them. In the aggregate, however, a large amount of land is fit for afforestation but not for cultivation, and the Commission endorse a policy of afforestation of steep hill-sides to prevent erosion, the prevention of grazing on land fit for afforestation, and, where practicable, the establishment of village forests for the benefit of neighbouring cultivators.Chapter X.—Immigration The problem of immigration has been aggravated by three factors :—(1) the drastic restrictions imposed on immigration in the United States, (2) the advent of the National Socialist Government in Germany, and (3) the increasing economic pressure on the Jews in Poland. The continuous impact of a highly intelligent and enterprising race backed by large financial resources on a comparatively poor, indigenous community, on a different cultural level, may produce i^ time serious reactions. The principle of economic absorptive capacity, meaning that considerations of economic capacity and these alone should determine immigration, is at present inadequ^'^*'* and ignores factors in the situation which wise statesmanship canndt disregard. Political, social and psychological factors should be taken into account. His Majesty's Government should lay down a “ political high level ” of Jewish immigration. This high level should be fixed for the next five years at 12,000 per annum. The High Commissioner should be given discretion to admit immigrants up to this maximum figure, but subject always to the economic absorptive capacity of the country. Among other alterations in the immigration regulations the Commission recommend that the Administration should have direct control over the immigrants coming in under Category A (i) (persons with £1,000 capital), and any person who desires to enter Palestine under this category should convince the Immigration authority not only that he is in possession of £1,000, but also that there is room in Palestine for additional members in the profession, trade or business which he proposes to pursue. The definition of “ dependency” should be revised so as to fall under two heads, (1) near relatives who, dependency being presumed, would have a right to come in, and (2) other relatives, in respecG whom the Immigration authority would have to be satisfied that tl can be maintained by the immigrant or permanent resident co cerned, as long as they remain dependent for maintenance. The final allocation of immigration certificates as determined by the Jewish Agency should be submitted to the High Commissioner for approval. Greater use should be made of the machinery of the District Administration in making enquiries in connection with the prepara tion of the half-yearly Labour Schedules. The housing situation is an economic consideration to which greater regard should be given when considering absorptive capacity. In so far as immigration has been the major factor in bringing the Jewish National Home to its present stage of development, the Mandatory has fully implemented his obligation to facilitate the establishment of a National Home for the Jewish people in Palestine,13 as is evidenced by the existence of a Jewish population of 400,000 persons. But this does not mean that the National Home should be crystallized at its present size. The Commission cannot accept the view that the Mandatory, having facilitated the establishment of a National Home, would be justified in shutting its doors. Its economic life depends to a large extent on further immigration and a large amount of capital has been invested in it on the assumption that immigration would continue. Restrictions on Jewish immigration will not solve the Palestine ^problem. The National Home seems already too big to the Arabs and, whatever its size, it bars the way to their attainment of national independence. Chapter XI.—Trans-Jordan The articles of the Mandate concerning the National Home do not apply to Trans-Jordan and the possibility of enlarging the National Home by Jewish immigration into Trans-Jordan rests on the assumption of concord between Jews and Arabs. Arab antago nism to Jewish immigration is at least as bitter in Trans-Jordan as it is in Palestine. The Government of Trans-Jordan would refuse to encourage Jewish immigration in the teeth of popular resistance. Chapter XII.—Health The Jewish grievances are summed up as complaints that not enough money has been spent by the Mandatory Government to assist the medical services established by the Jews from their own resources. What is given to one service must be taken from another, and it is not always remembered that Palestine, despite tke economic development of the National Home, is still a relatively (&gt;r country. The whole question illustrates the difficulty of JPljbroviding services in one State for two distinct communities with two very different standards of living. Chapter XIH.—Public Works and Services If it be assumed that the distribution of posts as between the two races should be proportional to the size of their respective populations, the Government have fairly maintained this proportion in the Civil Service generally, although the rapid expansion of the Jewish community has made this extremely difficult. In Palestine, where there are different rates of pay for Arab and Jewish unskilled labourers, and also frequent fluctuations in wage rates, it is practically impossible to maintain employment on public works on any fixed proportion between the races.The Commission make no recommendation with regard to the employment of Jews and non-Jews in Government Departments and on public works and services. They refer to the difficulties created by the antagonism between the two races, the differences in their standard of living and rates of wages and the additional complication of three different Holy Days, and state that they are satisfied that the Government have taken a broad view in dealing with the situation and that there is no foundation for the suggestion that the Government attitude towards the employment of Jews i|p^ unsympathetic. ▼ Chapter XIV.—The Christians fv The religious stake of the Christians in the Holy Places is juft as great as that of the Jews or Moslems. The Christians of the world cannot be indifferent to the justice and well-being of their co-religionists in the Holy Land. A memorandum setting out the grievances of the Arab Orthodox Community and complaining of the laissez-faire attitude of the Government was received too late for examination in detail, but it is pointed out that the Financial Commission appointed under the Orthodox Patriarchate Ordinance of 1928 has carried out an effective reform of the Patriarchate’s finances and that the reorganization of the internal affairs of the Patriarchate, including the establishment of a Mixed Council, has been discussed between the Government, the Patriarchate and the Laity and is at present under consideration by the Government. The Commission refer to the question of Sunday work by Christian officials resulting from the strict observance of the Jewish Sabbath, and are disposed to agree with the view that the existing state of affairs throws too much work on Christian officials and impairs the spiritual influence of the Christian Church. ^ In political matters the Christian Arabs have thrown in the^^ lot with their Moslem brethren. ^ - Chapter XV.—Nationality Law and Acquisition of Palestinian Citizenship As regards the grievance of the Arabs (stated to number about 40,000) who left Palestine before the War intending eventually to return but have been unable to obtain Palestinian citizenship, the Commission suggest that at least those who are able to establish an unbroken personal connection with Palestine and who are prepared to give a definite formal assurance of their intention to return, should be admitted to Palestinian citizenship. As regards Jews, the existing legislation implements the obligation of the Mandate on this subject. The Jews have not availed them selves readily of the opportunity afforded them of becoming15 (ro Palestinian citizens, and this is accounted for by the fact that their chief interest is in the Jewish Community itself. Allegiance to Palestine and to the Government are minor considerations to many of them. The Commission do not support the criticism of the restriction of the municipal franchise to Palestinian citizens. It is most desirable that all persons who intend to reside permanently in the country should become Palestinian citizens, and this qualification for voting ^ a direct inducement to them to do so. ^ Chapter XVI.—Education It seems unfortunate that the Administration has been unable to do more for education. It is not only the intrinsic value of education that should be considered. Any efforts to raise the material standards of life among the fellaheen can only be successful if they have received sufficient mental training to profit from technical instruction. Considering the inadequacy of the existing provision for Arab education, the Administration should regard its claims on the revenue as second in importance only to those of public security. Worse than the insufficiency of Arab schools, however, is the nationalist character of the education provided in the schools of both communities and for that the Commission can see no remedy at all. The ideal system of education would be a single bi-national system for both races. But that is virtually impossible under the Mandate, which prescribes ' the right of each community to maintain its own schools for the education of its own members in its own language.” The existing Arab and Jewish school systems are definitely widening and will continue to widen the gulf between the two races. Wherever practicable, e.g., in new technical or trade schools, rafxed education should be promoted. ^As regards the Jews’ claim for a larger grant for their system of i^ducation, the Commission consider that, until much more has been spent on the development of Arab education, so as to place it on a level with that of the Jews, it is unjustifiable to increase the grant to the latter, however desirable it might be in other circumstances. The extent to which the Jews have taxed themselves for education is one of the best features of the National Home ; and such “ self- help ” deserves all support ; but it should not be given by altering the present proportion between the grant to the Jews and the amount spent on the Arabs ; it should result from an increase in the total expenditure on education. The contrast between the Arab and Jewish systems of education is most striking at the top. The Jews have a university of high quality. The Arabs have none and the young intelligenzia of the country are unable to complete their education without the cost and inconvenience of going abroad. In any further discussion ofthe project of 3 . British Bniversity in the Necir Enst the possibility should be carefully considered of locating it in the neighbourhood of Jerusalem or Haifa. Chapter XVII.- Local Government The present system of rural self-government (through local Councils) falls short (1) in a lack of flexibility, (2) in undue centrali zation. An attempt should be made to strengthen those few loc^ councils which still exist in the Arab rural areas, but the Commission do not favour an attempt at present to revivify councils which have broken down or to create new ones unless there is a genujp^ ^ demand for them. There can be little really effective extension^ - village self-government until the provision of primary education has had more time to take effect. The deficiencies of the present system of municipal government are (1) a lack of initiative on the part of the more backward munici palities, and (2) the limitations set to initiative on the part of the more progressive municipalities by an Ordinance which subjects them all to the same measure of Government control and centralized administration. The limitation of power and responsibility largely accounts for the lack of interest shown by the townspeople in most municipal councils. Tel Aviv has unique problems of its own caused by its phenomenal growth during the last five years. The objectives which the people of Tel Aviv have set before them in the way of social services are in themselves admirable, and the ratepayers have shown a com mendable readiness to bear high rates for their realization. Ihe town has been faced with, and to a considerable extent surmounted, exceptional difficulties without seriously impairing its financial position. The more important local councils and all the municipalises should be reclassified by means of a new Ordinance into grouj^ according to their respective size and importance. The degree ot power and independence could then be varied to suit each class. For the first class of municipality the powers provided under the existing Ordinance are inadequate and should be extended. The services of an expert authority on local government should be obtained to assist in drafting the new Ordinance and in improving and co-ordinating the relations between Government and the municipalities, particularly in the larger towns, with special reference to the need of removing the causes of the present delay in approving municipal budgets. The need of Tel Aviv for a substantial loan should be promptly and sympathetically reconsidered. The normal constitutional relationship between the central and local authorities is impossible in Palestine.17 Chapter XVm.—Sell-governing Institutions Such hopes as may have been entertained in 1922 of any quick advance towards self-government have become less tenable. The bar to it—Arab antagonism to the National Home—so far from weakening, has grown stronger. The Jewish leaders might acquiesce in the establishment of a Legislative Council on the basis of parity, but the Commission are convinced that parity is not a practicable solution of the problem. is difficult to beheve that so artificial a device would operate effectively or last long, and in any case the Arab leaders would not ^cept it. ^ The Commission do not recommend that any attempt be made to revive the proposal of a Legislative Council, but since it is desirable that the Government should have some regular and effective means of sounding public opinion on its policy, the Commission would welcome an enlargement of the Advisory Council by the addition of Unofficial Members, who might be in a majority and might be elected, who could make representations by way of resolution, but who would not be empowered to pass or reject the budget or other legislative measures. Again, the Arabs are unlikely to accept such a proposal. The Arabs of Palestine, it has been admitted, are as fit to govern themselves as the Arabs of Iraq or Syria. I he Jews of Palestine are as fit to govern themselves as any organized and educated community in Europe. Yet, associated as they are under the Mandate, self-government is impracticable for both peoples. Ihe Mandate cannot be fully implemented nor can it honourably terminate in the independence of an undivided Palestine unless the conflict between Arab and Jew can be composed. » Chapter XIX.—Conclusions and Recommendations The Commission recapitulate the conclusions set out in this part of the Report, and summarize the Arab and Jewish grievances and their own recommendations for the removal of such as are legitimate. They add, however, that these are not the recommendations which their terms of reference require. They will not, that is to say, “ remove ” the grievances nor “ prevent their recurrence.” They are the best palliatives the Commission can devise for the disease from which Palestine is suffering, but they are only palliatives. They cannot cure the trouble. The disease is so deep-rooted that in the Commissioners’ firm conviction the only hope of a cure lies in a surgical operation.r 18 PART III : THE POSSIBILITY OF A LASTING SETTLEMENT Chapter XX.—The Force of Circumstances The problem of Palestine is briefly restated. Under the stress of the World War the British Government made promises to Arabs and Jews in Order to obtain their support. On the strength of those promises both parties formed certain expectations. The application to Palestine of the Mandate System in general and of the specific Mandate in particular implied the belief that the obligations thus undertaken towards the Arabs and the respectively would prove in course of time to be mutually compatible' owing to the conciliatory effect on the Palestinian Arabs of the material prosperity which Jewish immigration would bring to Palestine as a whole. That belief has not been justified, and there seems to be no hope of its being justified in the future. But the British people cannot on that account repudiate their obligations, and, apart from obligations, the existing circumstances in Palestine would still require the most strenuous efforts bn the part of the Government which is responsible for the welfare of the country. The existing circumstances are summarized as follows. An irrepressible conflict has arisen between two national com munities within the narrow bounds of one small country. There is no common ground between them. Their national aspirations are incompatible. The Arabs desire to revive the traditions of the Arab golden age. The Jews desire to show what they can achieve when restored to the land in which the Jewish nation was born. Neither of the two national ideals permits of combination in the service of a single State. The conflict has grown steadily more bitter since 1920 and t|P*\ process will continue. Conditions inside Palestine, especially tfJW systems of education, are strengthening the national sentiment of the two peoples. The bigger and more prosperous they grow the greater will be their political ambitions, and the conflict is aggravated by the uncertainty of the future. “ Who in the end will govern Palestine ? ” it is asked. Meanwhile, the “ external factors ” will continue to operate with increasing force. On the one hand in less than three years’ time Syria and the Lebanon will attain their national sovereignty, and the claim of the Palestinian Arabs to share in the freedom of all Asiatic Arabia will thus be fortified. On the other hand the hardships and anxieties of the Jews in Europe are not likely to grow less and the appeal to the good faith and humanity of the British people will lose none of its force. Meanwhile, the Government of Palestine, which is at present an unsuitable form for governing educated Arabs and democratic Jews, cannot develop into a system of self-government as it has elsewhere.(nO 19 because there is no such system which could ensuie justice both to the Arabs and to the Jews. Government therefore remains unrepre sentative and unable to dispel the conflicting grievances of the two dissatisfied and irresponsible communities it governs. In these circumstances peace can only be maintained in Palestine under the Mandate by repression. This means the maintenance of security services at so high a cost that the services directed to “ the well-being and development ” of the population cannot be expanded and may even have to be curtailed. The moral objections ^^to repression are self-evident. Nor need the undesirable reactions of it on opinion outside Palestine be emphasized. Moreover, ^ ^pression will not solve the problem. It will exacerbate the quarrel. ^ will not help towards the establishment of a single self-governing Palestine. It is not easy to pursue the dark path of repression without seeing daylight at the end of it. The British people will not flinch from the task of continuing to govern Palestine under the Mandate if they are in honour bound to do so, but they would be justified in asking if there is no other way in which their duty can be done. Nor would Britain wish to repudiate her obligations. Ihe trouble is that they have proved irreconcilable, and this conflict is the more unfortunate because each of the obligations taken separately accords with British sentiment and British interest. The develop ment of self-government in the Arab world on the one hand is in accordance with British principles, and British public opinion is wholly sympathetic with Arab aspirations towards a new age of unity and prosperity in the Arab world. British interest similarly has always been bound up with the peace of the Middle Bast and Bntish statesmanship can show an almost unbroken record of friendship with the Arabs. There is a strong British tradition, on the other hand, of friendship with the Jewish people, and it is in the British fcvterest to retain as far as may be the confidence of the Jewish people. 6* The continuance of the present system means the gradual aliena tion of two peoples who are traditionally the friends of Britain. The problem cannot be solved by giving either the Arabs or the Tews all they want. The answer to the question which of them in the end will govern Palestine must be “ Neither ”. No fair-minded statesman can think it right either that 400,000 Jews, whose entry into Palestine has been facilitated by the British Government and approved by the League of Nations, should be handed over to Arab rule, or that, if the Jews should become a majority, a million Arabs should be handed over to their rule. But while neither race can fairly rule all Palestine, each race might justly rule part of it. The idea of Partition has doubtless been thought of before as a solution of the problem, but it has probably been discaided as being impracticable. The difficulties are certainly very great, but when they are closely examined they do not seem so insuperable as the♦ 20 difficulties inherent in the continuance of the Mandate or in any other alternative arrangement. Partition offers a chance of ultimate peace. No other plan does. Chapter XXI. Cantonisation. The political division of Palestine could be effected in a less thorough manner than by Partition. It could be divided like Federal States into provinces and cantons, which would be self- governing in such matters as immigration and land sales as well as social services. The Mandatory Government would remain as a central or federal government controlling such matters as foreig relations, defence, customs and the like. Cantonisation is attractive at first sight because it seems to solve the three major problems of land, immigration and self-government, but there are obvious weaknesses in it. First, the working of federal systems depends on sufficient community of interest or tradition to maintain harmony between the Central Government and the cantons. In Palestine both Arabs and Jews would regard the Central Govern ment as an alien and interfering body. Secondly, the financial relations between the Central Government and the cantons would revive the existing quarrel between Arabs and Jews as to the distribution of a surplus of federal revenue or as to the contributions of the cantons towards a federal deficit. Unrestricted Jewish immigration into the Jewish canton might lead to a demand for the expansion of federal services at the expense of the Arab canton. Thirdly, the costly task of maintaining law and order would still rest mainly on the Central Government. Fourthly, Cantonisation like Partition cannot avoid leaving a minority of each race in the area controlled by the other. The solution of this problem requires such bold measures as can only be contemplated if there is a prospect of final peace. Partition opens up such a prospect. Cantonisation^ does not. Lastly, Cantonisation does not settle the question oi^ national self-government. Neither the Arabs nor the Jews would ^ feel their political aspirations were satisfied with purely cantonal self-government. Cantonisation, in sum, presents most, if not all, of the difficulties presented by Partition without Partition’s one supreme advantage ■—the possibilities it offers of eventual peace. Chapter XXII.—A Plan of Partition While the Commission would not be expected to embark on the further protracted inquiry which would be needed for working out a scheme of Partition in full detail, it would be idle to put-forward the principle of Partition and not to give it any concrete shape. Clearly it must be shown that an actual plan can be devised which meets the main requirements of the case.21 1. A Treaty System The Mandate for Palestine should terminate and be replaced by a Treaty System in accordance with the precedent set in Iraq and Syria. A new Mandate for the Holy Places should be instituted to fulfil the purposes defined in .Section 2 below. Treaties of alliance should be negotiated by the Mandatory with the Government of Trans-Jordan and representatives of the Arabs of Palestine on the one hand and with the Zionist Organisation on the other. Ihese Treaties would declare that, .within as short a period as may be convenient, two sovereign independent States would be established—the one an Arab State, consisting of Trans-Jordan united with that part of Palestine which lies to the east and south of a frontier such as we suggest in Section 3 below ; the other a Jewish State con sisting of that part of Palestine which lies to the north and west of that frontier. The Mandatory would undertake to support any requests for admission to the League of Nations which the Governments of the Arab and the Jewish States might make. The Treaties would include strict guarantees for the pro tection of minorities in each State, and the financial and other provisions to which reference will be made in subsequent Sections. Military conventions would be attached to the Treaties, dealing with the maintenance of naval, military and air forces, the upkeep and use of ports, roads and railways, the security of the oil pipe line and so forth. * 2. The Holy Places The Partition of Palestine is subject to the overriding necessity of keeping the sanctity of Jerusalem and Bethlehem inviolate and of ensuring free and safe access to them for all the world. That, in the fullest sense of the mandatory phrase, is “a sacred trust of civilization ”—a trust on behalf not merely of the peoples of Palestine but of multitudes in other lands to whom those places, one or both, are Holy Places. A new Mandate, therefore, should be framed with the execution of this trust as its primary purpose. An enclave should be demarcated extending from a point north of Jerusalem to a point south of Bethlehem, and access to the sea should be provided by a corridor extending to the north of the main road and to the south of the railway, including the towns of Lydda and Ramie, and terminating at Jaffa.# 22 The protection of the Holy Places is a permanent trust, unique in its character and purpose, and not contemplated by Article 22 of the Covenant of the League of Nations. In order to avoid mis understanding, it might frankly be stated that this trust will only terminate if and when the League of Nations and the United States desire it to do so, and that, while it would be the trustee’s duty to promote the well-being and development of the local population concerned, it is not intended that in course of time they should stand by themselves as a wholly self-governing community. gjj Guarantees as to the rights of the Holy Places and free access thereto (as provided in Article 13 of the existing Mandate), as to transit across the mandated area, and as to non-discrimination in^ fiscal, economic and other matters should be maintained in accordance with the principles of the Mandate System. But the policy of the Balfour Declaration would not apply ; and no question would arise of balancing Arab against Jewish claims or vice versa. All the inhabitants of the territory would stand on an equal footing. The only “ official language ” would be that of the Mandatory Administration. Good and just government without regard for sectional interests would be its basic principle. It would accord with Christian sentiment in the world at large if Nazareth and the Sea of Galilee (Lake Tiberias) were also covered by this Mandate. The Mandatory should be entrusted with the administration of Nazareth and with full powers to safeguard the sanctity of the waters and shores of Lake Tiberias. Ihe Mandatory should similarly be charged with the protection of religious endowments and of such buildings, monuments and places in the Arab and Jewish States as are sacred to the Jews and the Arabs respectively. For the upkeep of the Mandatory Government, a certain revenue should be obtainable, especially from the large and growin^T urban population in its charge, both by way of customs duties and ^ by direct taxation ; but it might prove insufficient for the normal cost of the administration. In that event, it is suggested that, in all the circumstances, Parliament would be willing to vote the money needed to make good the deficit. 3. The Frontier The natural principle for the Partition of Palestine is to separate the areas in which the Jews have acquired land and settled from those which are wholly or mainly occupied by Arabs. This offers a fair and practicable basis for Partition, provided that in accordance with the spirit of British obligations, (1) a reasonable allowance is made within the boundaries of the Jewish State for the growth of population and colonization, and (2) reasonable compensation is given to the Arab State for the loss of land and revenue.23 Any proposal for Partition would be futile if it gave no indication, however rough, as to how the most vital question in the whole matter might be determined, i.e., the frontier. As a solution of the problem, which seems both practicable and just, a rough line is proposed below. A Frontier Commission should be appointed to demarcate the precise frontier. * Starting from Ras an Naqura, it follows the existing northern and eastern frontier of Palestine to Lake Tiberias and crosses the Lake to the outflow of the River Jordan, whence it continues down the river to a point a little north of Beisan. It then cuts across the Beisan Plain and runs along the southern edge of the Valley of Jezreel and licross the Plain of Esdraelon to a point near Megiddo, whence it crosses the Carmel ridge in the neighbourhood of the Megiddo road. Having thus reached the Maritime Plain, the line runs southwards down its eastern edge, curving west to avoid Tulkarm, until it reaches the Jerusalem-Jaffa corridor near Lydda. South of the Corridor it continues down the edge of the Plain to a point about 10 miles south of Rehovot, when it turns west to the sea. The following observations and recommendations are made with regard to the proposed frontier and to questions arising from it :— (i) No frontier can be drawn which separates all Arabs and Arab-owned land from all Jews and Jew T ish-owned land. (ii) The Jews have purchased substantial blocks of land in the Gaza Plain and near Beersheba and obtained options for the purchase of other blocks in this area. The proposed frontier would prevent the utilization of those lands for the southward expansion of the Jewish National Home. On the other hand, the Jewish lands in Galilee, and in particular the Huleh basin (which offers a notable opportunity for development and colonization), would be in the Jewish Area. (iii) The proposed frontier necessitates the inclusion in the Jewish Area of the Galilee highlands between Safad and the Plain of Acre. This is the part of Palestine in which the Jew r s have retained a foothold almost if not entirely without a break from the beginning of the Diaspora to the present day, and the sentiment of all Jewry is deeply attached to the ' holy cities ” of Safad and Tiberias. Until quite recently, moreover, the Jews in Galilee have lived on friendly terms with their Arab neighbours ; and throughout the series of “ disturbances ” the fellaheen of Galilee have shown themselves less amenable to political incitement than those of Samaria and Judaea, where the centres of Arab nationalism are located. At the “ mixed ” towns of Tiberias, Safad, Haifa, and Acre there have been varying degrees of friction since the “ disturbances ” of last year. It would greatly promote the successful operation of Partition in its early stages, and in particular help to ensure the execution€ 24 of the Treaty guarantees for the protection of minorities, if those four towns were kept for a period under Mandatory administration. (iv) Jaffa is an essentially Arab town and should form part of the Arab State. The question of its communication with the latter presents no difficulty, since transit through the Jaffa— Jerusalem Corridor would be open to all. The Corridor, on the other hand, requires its own access to the sea, and for this purpose a narrow belt of land should be acquired and cleared on ^ the north and south sides of the town. (v) While the Mediterranean would be accessible to the Arab State at Jaffa and at Gaza, in the interests of Arab trad| and industry the Arab State should also have access for com mercial purposes to Haifa, the only existing deep-water port on the coast. The Jewish Treaty should therefore provide for the free transit of goods in bond between the Arab State and Haifa. The Arab Treatv, similarly, should provide for the free transit of goods in bond over the railway between the Jewish State and the Egyptian frontier. The same principle applies to the question of access for commercial purposes to the Red Sea. Ihe use of that exit to the East might prove in course of time of great advantage to both Arab and Jewish trade and industry, and, having regard to those possibilities, an enclave on the north-west coast of the Gulf of Aqaba should be retained under Mandatory administration, and the Arab ireaty should provide for the free transit of goods between the Jewish State and this enclave. The Treaties should provide for similar facilities for the transit of goods between the Mandated Area and Haifa, the Egyptian frontier and the Gulf of Aqaba. 4. Inter-State Subvention { The Jews contribute more per capita to the revenues of Palestine than the Arabs, and the Government has thereby been enabled to maintain public services for the Arabs at a higher level than would otherwise have been possible. Partition would mean, on the one hand, that the Arab Area would no longer profit from the taxable capacity of the Jewish Area. On the other hand, (1) the Jews would acquire a new right of sovereignty in the Jewish Area : (2) that Area, as we have defined it, would be larger than the existing area of Jewish land and settlement : (3) the Jews would be freed from their present liability for helping to promote the welfare of Arabs outside that Area. It is suggested, therefore, that the Jewish State should pay a subvention to the Arab State when Partition comes into effect. There have been recent precedents for equitable financial arrangements of this kind in those connected with the25 separation of Sind from Bombay and of Burma from the Indian Empire; and in accordance with those precedents a Finance Commission should be appointed to consider and report as to what the amount of the subvention should be. The Finance Commission should, also, consider and report on the proportion in which the Public Debt of Palestine, which now amounts to about £4,500,000, should be divided between the Arab and the Jewish States, and other financial questions. The Commission should also deal with telegraph and telephone systems in the event of Partition. 5. British Subvention The Inter-State Subvention would adjust the financial balance in Palestine ; but the plan involves the inclusion of Trans-Jordan in the Arab State. The taxable capacity of Trans-Jordan is very low and its revenues have never sufficed to meet the cost of its administration. From 1921 to the present day it has received grants-in-aid from the United Kingdom, wdiich have amounted to a total sum of £1,253,000 or an average of about £78,000 a year. Grants have also been made towards the cost of the Trans-Jordan Frontier Force, and loans to the amount of £60,000 have been provided for earthquake-relief and the distribution of seed. The Mandate for Trans-Jordan ought not to be relinquished without securing, as far as possible, that the standard of administra tion should not fall too low through lack of funds to maintain it ; and in this matter the British people might fairly be asked to do their part in facilitating a settlement. The continuance of the present Mandate would almost inevitably involve a recurrent and increasing charge on the British Treasury. If peace can be promoted by Partition, money spent on helping to bring it about and making it more effective for its purpose w r ould surely be well dfcpent. And apart from any such considerations the British people pi would, it is believed, agree to a capital payment in lieu of their present annual liability with a view to honouring their obligations and - making peace in Palestine. In the event of the Treaty system coming into force, Parliament should be as ked to make a grant of £2,000,000 to the Arab State. 6. Tariffs and Ports The Arab and Jewish States, being sovereign independent States, would determine their ow r n tariffs. Subject to the terms of the Mandate, the same would apply to the Mandatory Government. The tariff-policies of the Arab and Jewish States are likely to conflict, and it would greatly ease the position and promote the interests of both the Arab and Jewish States if they could agree to impose identical customs-duties on as many articles as possible,c 26 and if the Mandatory Government, likewise, could assimilate its customs-duties as far as might be with those of one or both of the two States. It should be an essential part of the proposed Treaty System that a commercial convention should be concluded with a view to establishing a common tariff over the widest possible range of imported articles and to facilitating the freest possible interchange of goods between the three territories concerned. 7. Nationality All persons domiciled in the Mandated Area (including Haifag Acre, Tiberias, Safad and the enclave on the Gulf of Aqaba, as lon^ as they remain under Mandatory administration) who now possess the status of British protected persons would retain it ; but apart from this all Palestinians would become the nationals of the States in which they are domiciled. 8. Civil Services It seems probable that, in the event of Partition, the services of the Arab and Jewish officials in the pre-existing Mandatory Administration would to a large extent be required by the Govern ments of the Arab and Jewish States respectively, whereas the number of British officials would be substantially reduced. The rights of all of them, including rights to pensions or gratuities, must be fully honoured in accordance with Article 28 of the existing Mandate. This matter should be dealt with by the Finance Commission. 9. Industrial Concessions In the event of Partition agreements entered into by the Govern^* ment of Palestine for the development and security of industries (e.g., the agreement with the Palestine Potash Company) should w 1 be taken over and carried out by the Governments of the Arab and Jewish States. Guarantees to that effect should be given in the Treaties. The security of the Electric Power Station at Jisr el Majami should be similarly guaranteed. 10. Exchange of Land and Population If Partition is to be effective in promoting a final settlement it must mean more than drawing a frontier and establishing two States. Sooner or later there should be a transfer of land and, as far as possible, an exchange of population. The Treaties should provide that, if Arab owners of land in the Jewish State or Jewish owners of land in the Arab State should wish to sell their land and any plantations or crops thereon, theGovernment of the State concerned should be responsible for the purchase of such land, plantations and crops at a price to be fixed, if required, by the Mandatory Administration. For this purpose a loan should, if required, be guaranteed for a reasonable amount. The political aspect of the land problem is still more important. Owing to the fact that there has been no census since 1931 it is impossible to calculate with any precision the distribution of popula tion between the Arab and Turkish areas ; but, according to an approximate estimate, in the area allocated to the Jewish State (excluding the urban districts to be retained for a period under Mandatory Administration) there are now about 225,000 Arabs. In Tfcthe area allocated to the Arab State there are only about 1,250 Jews ; but there are about 125,000 Jews as against 85,000 Arabs in Jerusalem and Haifa. The existence of these minorities clearly constitutes the most serious hindrance to the smooth and successful operation of Partition. If the settlement is to be clean and final, the question must be boldly faced and firmly dealt with. It calls for the highest statesmanship on the part of all concerned. A precedent is afforded by the exchange effected between the Greek and Turkish populations on the morrow of the Greco-Turkish War of 1922. A convention was signed by the Greek and Turkish Governments, providing that, under the supervision of the League of Nations, Greek nationals of the Orthodox religion living in Turkey should be compulsorily removed to Greece, and Turkish nationals of the Moslem religion living in Greece to Turkey. The numbers involved were high—no less than some 1,300,000 Greeks and some 400,000 Turks. But so vigorously and effectively was the task accomplished that within about eighteen months from the spring of 1923 the whole exchange was completed. The courage of the Greek and Turkish statesmen concerned has been justified by the result. Before ^fthe operation the Greek and Turkish minorities had been a constant irritant. Now Greco-Turkish relations, are friendlier than they have ever been before. In Northern Greece a surplus of cultivable land was available or could rapidly be made available for the settlement of the Greeks evacuated from Turkey. In Palestine there is at present no such surplus. Room exists or could soon be provided within the proposed boundaries of the Jewish State for the Jews now living in the Arab area. It is the far greater number of Arabs who constitute the major problem ; and, while some of them could be re-settled on the land vacated by the Jews, far more land would be required for the re-settlement of all of them. Such information as is available justifies the hope that the execution of large-scale plans for irrigation, water-storage, and development in Trans-Jordan, Beersheba and the Jordan Valley would make provision for a much larger population than exists there at the present time.Those areas, therefore, should be surveyed and an estimate made of the practical possibilities of irrigation and development as quickly as possible. If, as a result, it is clear that a substantial amount of land could be made available for the re-settlement of Arabs living in the Jewish area, the most strenuous efforts should be made to obtain an agreement for the transfer of land and population. In view of the present antagonism between the races and of the manifest advantage to both of them for reducing the opportunities of future friction to the utmost, it is to be hoped that the Arab and the Jewish leaders might show the same high statesmanship as that of the Turks and^r the Greeks and make the same bold decision for the sake of peace. The cost of the proposed irrigation and development schem^t' would be heavier than the Arab State could be expected to beaiv Here again the British people, it is suggested, would be willing to help to bring about a settlement ; and if an arrangement could be made for the transfer, voluntary or otherwise, of land and population, Parliament should be asked to make a grant to meet the cost of the aforesaid scheme. If it should be agreed to terminate the Mandate and establish a Treaty System on a basis of Partition, there would be a period of transition before the new regime came into force, and during this period the existing Mandate would continue to be the governing instrument of the Palestine Administration. But the recommenda tions made in Part II of the Report as to what should be done under the existing Mandate presupposed its continuance for an indefinite time and would not apply to so changed a situation as the prospect of Partition would bring about. The following are recommendations for the period of transition :— (1) Land .—Steps should be taken to prohibit the purchase o^ land by Jews within the Arab Area {i.e., the area of the project Arab State) or by Arabs within the Jewish Area {i.e., the area ♦ of the projected Jewish State). The settlement of the plain-lands of the Jewish Area should be completed within two years. (2) Immigration .—Instead of the political “ high-level ” there should be a territorial restriction on Jewish immigration. No Jewish immigration into the Arab Area should be permitted. Since it would therefore not affect the Arab Area and since the Jewish State would soon become responsible for its results, the volume of Jewish immigration should be determined by the economic absorptive capacity of Palestine less the Arab Area. (3) Trade .—Negotiations should be opened without delay to secure the amendment of Article 18 of the Mandate and to place the external trade of Palestine upon a fairer basis.29 (4) Advisory Council .—The Advisory Council should, if possible, be enlarged by the nomination of Arab and Jewish representatives ; but, if either party refused to serve, the Council should continue as at present. (5) Local Government .—The municipal system should be re-formed on expert advice. (6) Education .—A vigorous effort should be made to increase the number of Arab schools. The “ mixed schools ” situated in the area to be administered under the new Mandate should be given every support, and the possibility of a British University should be considered, since those institutions might play an important part after Partition in helping to bring about an ultimate reconciliation of the races. Chapter XXm— Conclusion Considering the attitude which both the Arab and the Jewish representatives adopted in giving evidence, the Commission think it improbable that either party will be satisfied at first sight with the proposals submitted for the adjustment of their rival claims. For Partition means that neither will get all it wants. It means that the Arabs must acquiesce in the exclusion from their sovereignty of a piece of territory, long occupied and once ruled by them. It means that the Jews must be content with less than the Land of Israel they once ruled and have hoped to rule again. But it seems possible that on reflection both parties will come to realize that the drawbacks of Partition are outweighed by its advantages. For, if it offers meither party all it wants, it offers each what it wants most, namely ^^•eedom and security. The advantages to the Arabs of Partition on the lines we have proposed may be summarized as follows :— (i) They obtain their national independence and can co operate on an equal footing with the Arabs of the neigh bouring countries in the cause of Arab unity and progress. (ii) They are finally delivered from the fear of being “ swamped ” by the Jews, and from the possibility of ultimate subjection to Jewish rule. (hi) In particular, the final limitation of the Jewish National Home within a fixed frontier and the enactment of a new Mandate for the protection of the Holy Places, solemnly guaranteed by the League of Nations, removes all anxiety lest the Holy Places should ever come under Jewish control.(iv) As a set-off to the loss of territory the Arabs regard as theirs, the Arab State will receive a subvention from the Jewish State. It will also, in view of the backwardness of Trans-Jordan, obtain a grant of £2,000,000 from the British Treasury; and, if an agreement can be reached as to the exchange of land and population, a further grant will be made for the conversion, as far as may prove possible, of uncultivable land in the Arab State into productive land from which the cultivators and the State alike will profit. The advantages of Partition to the Jews may be summarized as follows :— 9 (i) Partition secures the establishment of the JewistfL National Home and relieves it from the possibility of its being subjected in the future to Arab rule. (ii) Partition enables the Jews in the fullest sense to call their National Home their own ; for it converts it into a Jewish State. Its citizens will be able to admit as many Jews into it as they themselves believe can be absorbed. They will attain the primary objective of Zionism—a Jewish nation, planted in Palestine, giving its nationals the same status in the world as other nations give theirs. They will cease at last to live a “ minority life.” To both Arabs and Jews Partition offers a prospect—and there is none in any other policy—of obtaining the inestimable boon of peace. It is surely worth some sacrifice on both sides if the quarrel which the Mandate started could be ended with its termination. It is not a natural or old-standing feud. The Arabs throughout their history have not only been free from anti-Jewish sentiment but have also shown that the spirit of compromise is deeply rooted in their life. Considering what the possibility of finding a refuge in Palestine means to many thousands of sufferir^| Jews, is the loss occasioned by Partition, great as it would b^^ more than Arab generosity can bear ? In this, as in so much else ^ connected with Palestine, it is not only the peoples of that country who have to be considered. The Jewish Problem is not the least of the many problems which are disturbing international relations at this critical time and obstructing the path to peace and prosperity. If the Arabs at some sacrifice could help to solve that problem, they would earn the gratitude not of the Jews alone but of all the Western World. There was a time when Arab statesmen were willing to concede little Palestine to the Jews, provided that the rest of Arab Asia were free. That condition was not fulfilled then, but it is on the eve of fulfilment now. In less than three years’ time all the wide Arab area outside Palestine between the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean will be independent, and, if Partition is adopted, the greater part of Palestine will be independent too.(g) 31 As to the British people, they are bound to honour to the utmost of their power the obligations they undertook in the exigencies of war towards the Arabs and the Jews. When those obligations were incorporated in the Mandate, they did not fully realize the difficulties of the task it laid on them. They have tried to overcome them, not always with success. The difficulties have steadily become greater till now they seem almost insuperable. Partition offers a possibility of finding a way through them, a ^possibility of obtaining a final solution of the problem which does justice to the rights and aspirations of both the Arabs and the Jews and discharges the obligations undertaken towards them iwenty years ago to the fullest extent that is practicable in the ^^rcumstances of the present time.SHORT SUMMARY OF MAIN RECOMMENDATIONS I.-—Recommendations under the Mandate Administration There should be no hesitation in dispensing with the services of Palestinian officers whose loyalty or impartiality is uncertain. jj There should be more decentralisation. m A British Senior Government Advocate should be appointed. The Jaffa-Haifa road should be completed as speedily as possible. Public Security Should disorders break out again of such a nature as to require the inter vention of the Military, there should be no hesitation in enforcing martial law. In such an event the disarmament first of the Arabs and then of the Jews should be enforced. In mixed areas British District Officers should be appointed. Central and local police reserves are necessary. A large mobile mounted force is also essential. A more rigorous Press Ordinance should be adopted. Financial and Fiscal Questions Negotiations should be opened to amend the provisions of Article 18 of the Mandate and put the trade of Palestine on a fairer basis. Land The High Commissioner should be empowered to prohibit the transfer^fc of land in any stated area to Jews. (The amendment of the Mandate may. first be necessary.) Until survey and settlement are complete the sale of isolated and com paratively small plots of land to Jews should be prohibited. The Commission favour a proposal for the creation of special Public Utility Companies to undertake development schemes. An expert Committee should be appointed to draw up a Land Code. Settlement should be expedited. In the event of further sales of land by Arabs to Jews, the rights of any Arab tenants or cultivators must be preserved. Alienation of land should only be allowed where it is possible to replace extensive by intensive culti vation, i.e., in the plains, and not at present in the hills. Legislation vesting surface water in the High Commissioner is essential. Possibilities of irrigation should be explored. The scheme for the develop ment of the Huleh district is commended. Measures of afforestation are recommended.Immigration The volume of Jewish immigration should continue to be restricted in the first instance by the economic absorptive capacity of Palestine, but it should be subject to a “ political high level,” covering Jewish immigration of all categories. This high level should be fixed for the next five years at 12,000 per annum. Amendments in the categories under the Immigration Ordinance and in the definition of ” dependency ” are proposed. Education The Administration should regard the claims on the revenue of Arab education as second in importance only to those of public security. The present proportion between the grant to Jewish education and the amount ^ent on the Arabs should not be altered : an increase in the grant to the ?ws should result from an increase in the total expenditure on education. In any further discussion of the project of a British University in the Near East, the possibility should be considered of locating it in the neighbourhood of Jerusalem or Haifa. Local Government An attempt should be made to strengthen those few local councils which still exist in Arab rural areas, but not to revivify councils which have broken down, or to create new ones unless there is a genuine demand for them. The more important local councils and all the municipalities should be reclassified, by means of a new Ordinance, into groups according to their respective size and importance. The services of an expert on local government should be obtained to assist in drafting the new Ordinance and improving the relations between Govern ment and the municipalities. The need of Tel Aviv for a substantial loan should be promptly and sympathetically reconsidered. Self-governing Institutions The Commission do not recommend that any attempt be made to revive the proposal of a Legislative Council, but they would welcome an enlargement of the Advisory Council by the addition of Unofficial Members. , Conclusion ' The above recommendations for dealing with Arab and Jewish grievances under the Mandate will not ” remove ” them or “ prevent their recurrence.” They are the best palliatives the Commission can devise, but they will not solve the problem.II.—Recommendations for termination of the present Mandate on a basis of Partition Having reached the conclusion that there is no possibility of solving the Palestine problem under the existing Mandate (or even under a scheme of Cantonisation), the Commission recommend the termination of the present Mandate on the basis of Partition and put forward a definite scheme which they consider to be practicable, honourable and just. The scheme is follows:— Vf The Mandate for Palestine should terminate and be replaced by a Treaty System in accordance with the precedent set in Iraq and Syria. Under Treaties to be negotiated by the Mandatory with the GovernmdTTl of Trans-Jordan and representatives of the Arabs of Palestine on the one hand and with the Zionist Organisation on the other it would be declared that two sovereign independent States would shortly be established—(1) an Arab State consisting of Trans-Jordan united with that part of Palestine allotted to the Arabs, (2) a Jewish State consisting of that part of Palestine allotted to the Jews. The Mandatory would undertake to support any requests for admission to the League of Nations made by the Governments of the Arab and Jewish States. The Treaties would include strict guarantees for the protection of minorities. Military Conventions would be attached to the Treaties. A new Mandate should be instituted to execute the trust of maintaining the sanctity of Jerusalem and Bethlehem and ensuring free and safe access to them for all the world. An enclave should be demarcated to which this Mandate should apply, extending from a point north of Jerusalem to a point south of Bethlehem, and access to the sea should be provided by a corridor extending from Jerusalen to Jaffa. Ihe policy of the Balfour Declaration would not apply to the Mandated Area. The Mandatory should also be entrusted with the administration of Nazareth and with full powers to safeguard the sanctity of the waters and shores of Lake Tiberias, and similarly with the protection of religious endow ments and of such buildings, monuments and places in the Arab and Jewish States as are sacred to the Jews and the Arabs respectively. A The frontier between the Arab and Jewish States recommended is * follows. Starting from Ras an Naqura, it follows the existing northern an^jJT eastern frontier of Palestine to Lake Tiberias and crosses the Lake to the outflow of the River Jordan, whence it continues down the river to a point rather north of Beisan. It then cuts across the Beisan Plain and runs along the southern edge of the Valley of Jezreel to a point near Megiddo, whence it crosses the Carmel Ridge in the neighbourhood of the Megiddo road. It theri runs southwards down the eastern edge of the Maritime Plain, curving west to avoid Tulkarm, until it reaches the Jerulsaem-Jaffa Corridor near Lydda. South of the Corridor it continues down the edge of the Plain to a point about ten miles south of Rehovot, whence it turns west to the sea. Haifa, Tiberias, Safad and Acre should be kept for a period under Manda tory administration. Jaffa should form an outlying part of the Arab State, narrow belts of land being acquired and cleared on the north and south sides of the town to provide access from the Mandatory Corridor to the sea. The Jewish Treaty should provide for free transit of goods in bond between the Arab State and Haifa.35 In view of possible commercial developments in the future, an enclave on the north-west coast of the Gulf of Aqaba should be retained under Mandatory administration, and the Arab Treaty should provide for free transit of goods between the Jewish State and this enclave, as also to the Egyptian frontier at Rafah. The Treaty should provide for similar facilities for the transit of goods between the Mandated Area and Haifa, Rafah and the Gulf of Aqaba. The Jewish State should pay a subvention to the Arab State. A Finance Commission should be appointed to advise as to its amount and as to the vision of the public debt of Palestine and other financial questions. In view of the backwardness of Trans-Jordan, Parliament should be asked to make a grant of ^2,000,000 to the Arab State. As a part of the proposed Treaty System, a Commercial Convention should '^concluded with a view to establishing a common tariff over the widest possible range of imported articles and to facilitating the freest possible interchange of goods between the three territories. The rights of all existing Civil Servants, including rights to pensions or gratuities, should be fully honoured. Agreements entered into by the Government of Palestine for the develop ment and security of industries, e.g., that with the Palestine Potash Company, should be taken over and carried out by the Governments of the Arab and Jewish States. Guarantees to that effect should be given in the Treaties. The security of the Power Station at Jisr el Majami should be similarly guaranteed. The Treaties should provide that if Arab owners of land in the Jewish State or Jewish owners in the Arab State wish to sell their land, the Govern ment of the State concerned should be responsible for purchase at a price to be fixed, if required, by the Mandatory Government. An immediate enquiry should be undertaken into the possibilities of irrigation and development in Trans-Jordan, the Beersheba District and the Jordan Valley. If it becomes clear that a substantial amount of land could be made available for the resettlement of Arabs living in the Jewish Area, strenuous efforts should be made to obtain an agreement, in the interests of both parties concerned, for an exchange of land and population. To facilitate such an agreement the United Kingdom Parliament should be asked to make a^grant to meet the cost of the necessary development scheme. For the transition period which would intervene before the Treaties came ''xito force, the Commission’s recommendations are as follows. Land purchase &gt;y Jews within the Arab Area or by Arabs within the Jewish Area should be prohibited. No Jewish immigration into the Arab Area should be permitted. The volume of Jewish immigration should be determined by the economic absorptive capacity of Palestine less the Arab Area. Negotiations should be opened without delay to secure amendment of Article 18 of the Mandate ai.d place the external trade of Palestine on a fairer basis. The Advisory Council should, if possible, be enlarged by the nomination of Arab and Jewish representatives. The municipal system should be re-formed on expert advice, as recommended. A vigorous effort should be made to increase the number of Arab schools. The Commission point out that, while these proposals do not offer either the Arabs or the Jews all they want, they offer each party what it wants most, namely, freedom and security. The advantages to the Arabs of Palestine may be summarized as follows :— (i) They obtain their national independence and can co-operate on an equal footing with the Arabs of the neighbouring countries in the cause of Arab unity and progress.I 36 (ii) They are finally delivered from the fear of being “ swamped ” by the Jews and from the possibility of ultimate subjection to Jewish rule. (iii) In particular, the final limitation of the Jewish National Home within a fixed frontier and the enactment of a new Mandate for the protection of the Holy Places, solemnly guaranteed by the League of Nations, removes all anxiety lest the Holy Places should ever come under Jewish control. (iv) As a set-off to the loss of territory the Arabs regard as theirs, the Arab State will receive a subvention from the Jewish State. It will also, in view of the backwardness of Trans-Jordan, obtain a grary^ of ^2,000,000 from the British Treasury ; and, if an agreement can reached as to the exchange of land and population, a further grant will be made for the conversipn, as far as may prove possible, of uncultivable land in the Arab State into productive land from which the cultiva^^t and the State alike will profit. The advantages to the Jews are :— (i) Partition secures the establishment of the Jewish National Home and relieves it from the possibility of its being subjected in the future to Arab rule. (ii) Partition enables the Jews in the fullest sense to call their National Home their own : for it converts it into a Jewish State. Its citizens will be able to admit as many Jews into it as they themselves believe can be absorbed. They will attain the primary objective of Zionism—- a Jewish nation, planted in Palestine, giving its nationals the same status in the world as other nations give theirs. They will cease at last to live a “ minority life.” (C 26050) 1,100 6/37from aM / ) (^&gt; on recess at Ziarat. To the political hclatent* Bushira.

As you are aware, it has been announced that a further special body will be appointed to visit Palestine, and to submit to His Majesty’s Government, after consultation with the local communities, proposals for a detailed scheme of partition; and that it will be the task of this body to advise in due course as to the provisional boundaries of the proposed Arab and Jewish * Cmd. 5479 .3 areas and of the new British Mandated area, and also to under take the financial and other enquiries for which the Royal Com mission recommended that a Financial Commission should be appointed. The functions of this new body will be to act as a technical Commission, that is to say, its functions will be con fined to ascertaining facts and to considering in detail the practical possibilities of a scheme of partition. 6. The terms of reference of the technical Commission will be as follows:— ^ “ Taking into account the plan of partition outlined in Part III of the Report of the Royal Commission, but with full liberty to suggest modifications of that plan, including variation of the areas recommended for retention under British Mandate, And taking into account any representations of the com munities in Palestine and Trans-Jordan— (i) to recommend boundaries for the proposed Arab and Jewish areas and the enclaves to be retained per manently or temporarily under British Mandate which will— (а) afford a reasonable prospect of the eventual establishment, with adequate security, of self-sup porting Arab and Jewish States; (б) necessitate the inclusion of the fewest pos sible Arabs and Arab enterprises in the Jewish area and vice versa; and (c) enable His Majesty's Government to carry out the Mandatory responsibilities the assumption of which is recommended in the Report of the Royal Commission, including the obligations im posed by Article 28 of the Mandate as regards the ^ Holy Places; (ii) to examine and report on the economic and ^ financial questions involved in partition upon which decisions will require to be taken, including— (a) the allocation so far as may be necessary between the various areas of the public assets and public debt of Palestine and other ‘ financial obligations legitimately incurred by the Adminis tration of Palestine during the period of the Mandate ’ referred to in Article 28 thereof; (b) means to ensure that the financial obliga tions referred to above will be fully honoured in accordance with Article 28 of the Mandate; (c) the administration of the railways, ports, postal, telegraph and telephone services; A 2 471214 (d) currency arrangements; (e) customs administration and tariffs; (/) the budgetary prospects of the various Ad ministrations to be established; (g) the preservation of the rights of civil servants in accordance with the provisions of Article 28 of the Mandate; (h) the treatment of industrial and other con cessions ; (t) the possibility of voluntary exchanges of lancP and population, and the prospects of providing by works of land development room for furtlMi^. settlement to meet the needs of persons desiring^ move from one area to another; (;) the provision of effective safeguards for the rights of religious or racial minorities in the areas to be allocated to Arab and Jews respectively, including the protection of religious rights and properties.’' 7. If, as a result of the investigations of the technical Com mission, which will undoubtedly occupy many months, a scheme of partition is regarded as equitable and practicable by His Majesty’s Government, it will be referred to the Council of the League for consideration. If the scheme is approved by the League Council, a further period will be required for the establishment of new systems of government under mandate in the areas concerned and, if the necessary consent is forth coming, for the negotiation of treaties with a view to the eventual establishment of independent States. It may also be necessary, in the light of the Commission’s report, for His Majesty’s Government to give further consideration to the suggestion of the Permanent Mandates Commission that the Arab and Jewi® areas should be administered temporarily under a system of “ cantonisation ” or under separate mandates. It is obvious, therefore, that, for some time to come, any action taken will be only of an exploratory nature. 8.

In the Statement of Policy of July, 1937 (Cmd. 5513) it was stated that His Majesty’s Government had been driven to the conclusion “ that a scheme of partition on the general lines recommended by the Commission represents the best and most hopeful solution of the deadlock ” “ His Majesty’s Government, therefore, propose to take such ''“Nteps as are necessary and appropriate .... to obtain freedom to give effect to a scheme of partition, to which they earnestly hope that it may be possible to secure an effective measure of isent on the part of the communities concerned.” 2. Parliament. The House of Commons, on the 21st July, 1937, passed a resolution to the following effect: — ” That the proposals contained in Command Paper No. 5513 relating to Palestine should be brought before the League of Nations with a view to enabling His Majesty’s Government, after adequate enquiry, to present to Parlia ment a definite scheme taking into full account all the recommendations of the Command Paper.” 3. Statements by Mr. Ormsby Gore before Permanent Mandates Commission. ” What I ask is that you should advise the Council that, in the light of our experience and our knowledge of Palestine, a solution on the lines of partition should be explored as the best and most hopeful solution of what the mandatory Power is itself convinced is, in fact, a deadlock. I do not ask you to approve a scheme of partition, or to settle these questions of defence, minorities, &amp;c. All I ask you is to recommend that the door .ould not be closed to a solution by partition. I ask you to open the door and not to close it. I do not ask the Mandates Commission to commit itself finally, but to allow the mandatory Power to explore the solution which it thinks best in the circum stances, and to produce for the League in due course a more definite scheme for your later consideration.” (Minutes of Thirty-Second Session, pp. 37-38-) * * * * “ It was his belief that, in view of the actual wording of the Royal Commission’s report, and in view of the mandatory Power’s declaration that a deadlock had arisen and that its hopes of seeing Palestine evolve into a self-governing State, where Jews and Arabs would have reconciled their differences, had not been fulfilled, and in view of the fact that neighbouring6 Arab States had intervened, and in view of all the efforts sincerely made to work the mandate as drafted, he was satisfied that no British Government could administer Palestine on the basis of the existing mandate without considerable alterations.” (Minutes, p. 169.) * * * * “ The idea that it would be open to the United Kingdom or any other Power to carry on the existing mandate was an idea in which he hoped the Mandates Commission would not take refuge. He said frankly, not speaking for himself, but speaking on behalf of the United Kingdom Government, tha^T the prospects of carrying on indefinitely on the terms of the existing mandate seemed to His Majesty’s Government to be a commitment involving repression, involving continual frict^fi and hostility between each of the two races, on the one hancl, and the Administration on the other, as well as between the two races themselves, in a manner which could not inure to the advantage of any one of the three parties concerned—or, for that matter, to the credit of the mandate system or of the League itself. “ Mr. Ormsby Gore was satisfied that a new solution—a political solution, as he had described it—of the problem of Palestine must be explored in the interests of the future peace of Palestine, and, further, in the wider interest of the future relations between the Jews and the world of Islam, for the benefit of the suffering Jews in Europe, as well as for the benefit of the peace of the world. It was in the light of these broad political considerations that he came before the Mandates Com mission, not as an administrator, but quite frankly as a politician, to say that, in his opinion, and in the opinion of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, it was essential that a solution of what they regarded quite definitely as a deadlock should be explored.” (Minutes, pp. 184-185.) * * * * [Mr. Ormsby Gore] had certainly had no intention of con veying the impression that the Balfour Declaration was not still a binding obligation on both the League and the United Kingdom. Obviously, like the mandate, it was still a binding obligation, and would remain so until replaced by an in dependent Jewish State. It was only if the suggested plan of partition were accepted, and eventuated in the creation of a Jewish State, that the Balfour Declaration would reach its fruition and cease to be binding. Similarly, the mandate was binding until it was replaced by another regime in Palestine.” (Minutes, p. 182.) * * * * “ The Mandates Commission would see that the solution re commended by the Arab Higher Committee implied: first, the7 retention by the Arabs of the right to complete independence in their own land, which they described as the whole of Palestine; second, the cessation (whatever that meant) of the experiment of the Jewish National Home; third, the cessation of the British mandate and its replacement by a treaty similar to those existing between the United Kingdom and Iraq, the United Kingdom and Egypt, and France and Syria, constitut ing Palestine a sovereign State; and, fourth, the immediate cessation of all Jewish immigration and of land sales to Jews pending the conclusion of the treaty. That solution, Mr. 4 ^)rmsby Gore wished to say, quite frankly, was unacceptable lO the United Kingdom Government if it were for the whole of Palestine.” (Minutes, p. 191.) * * * I take it that the basic principle of any partition scheme would be to leave as few Jews as possible in the Arab State; indeed, even under the proposals of the Royal Commission, that seems to be the main basis upon which it has acted, and would, I believe, be the only possible basis on which a frontier could be drawn. But, however you draw that frontier, it is inevitable that there will be a large Arab minority in the Jewish State, and it is therefore politically wise, and indeed necessary, that special provisions should be made for the legitimate safeguard ing of the interests of that minority. And again, on the other side, though an appreciable number of the Christians will be in the proposed British mandatory enclave, there will be, in the proposed Arab State, however you draw that frontier, a con siderable number of Christians.” (Minutes, p. 37.) * * * * “ Therefore, I grant that provisions for safeguarding minori ties will have to be made over and above the ordinary pro visions which are made in the ordinary minorities treaties •Crating under League auspices in many countries in Europe. ... I see no reason why, in the case of Palestine, we ^^should be strictly limited to the kind of procedure which operates in those European States.” (Minutes, p. 37.) 4. Permanent Mandates Commission. The Report of the Permanent Mandates Commission to the Council of the League on the work of its Thirty-second (Extra ordinary) Session contains the following conclusions: — “ The Commission therefore considers that it is worth con tinuing the examination of the advantages and drawbacks of a new territorial solution. It appears quite natural and legiti mate that the mandatory Power, rightly anxious to give satis faction to the conflicting aspirations of Arabs and Jews in Palestine, and having failed to do so by the institution of a6 common administration for the whole territory, should be em powered to contemplate in some form or other the establish ment of a regime in which these aspirations would each be satisfied in a part of the territory. “ This satisfaction cannot, of course, be complete. For the Arabs, any partition must necessarily involve the abandonment of a fraction of what they consider to be their hereditary patrimony. For the Jews, it could involve, together with a restriction of the scope of their national home, already limited, as they allege, by die exclusion of Trans-Jordan in 1922, a fresh reduction in its capacity of absorbing population. ^ “ Any solution to prove acceptable should therefore depriv the Arabs of as small a number as possible of the places to which they attach particular value, either because they are t^ir present homes or for reasons of religion. And, further, aie areas allotted to the Jews should be sufficiently extensive, fertile and well situated from the point of view of communications by sea and land to be capable of intensive economic development, and consequently of dense and rapid settlement. ... “ The Commission would be failing in its duty if it did not draw the Council’s attention to the delicate problem of the transfer of populations from one territory to the other which might be necessary if there was a partition. In order to guarantee that the advantages of such a transfer should out weigh the disadvantages, particular care would have to be given to ensure that it was carried out with the greatest fairness. “ As regards the proposal to withdraw the Holy Places from the domination of Arabs and Jews and place them under a special regime, the Commission thinks that such a step could not but be of advantage to general peace, provided that this regime was based on Article 28 of the present mandate. . . . ‘ ‘ While declaring itself favourable in principle to an examina tion of a solution involving the partition of Palestine, the Com mission is, nevertheless, opposed to the idea of the immediate creation of two new independent States. . . . “ The Commission therefore considers that a prolongatiou** of the period of political apprenticeship constituted by the man date would be absolutely essential both to the new Arab State and to the new Jewish State. This apprenticeship might be carried on in one of two forms.” ” Provisional cantonization ” and “ Two Mandates ” are then discussed. 5. Extracts from the Speech of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs at the g8th Session of the Council of the League of Nations, on the 14th September, 1937. ' I would remind the Council that the Balfour Declaration itself had a dual character. On the one hand, it provided forthe Jewish national home, on the other it laid down the con dition that nothing should be done which might prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine or the rights or political status enjoyed by Jews elsewhere. “ It is clear that under these provisions a twofold task was imposed upon the mandatory Power. It was under an obliga tion to further the establishment of the Jewish national home, and at the same time it was bound to do its best to guide the country as a whole along the path towards full nationhood. ■Iideed, the development of self-governing institutions is one of the objects specifically prescribed in Article 2 of the mandate. j^At the time when the mandate was drawn up by our pre- dffssors it was clearly not contemplated that these two obliga tions would prove mutually incompatible. ... No one, least of all the mandatory Power itself, or the Council of the League, who approved the form of the mandate, anticipated that the future would be entirely free from difficulties. But it was hoped that the two races in Palestine would so adjust their national aspirations as to render possible the establishment of a single self-governing commonwealth under a unitary Government. This hope has, unfortunately, not been fulfilled. The reasons for its non-fulfilment are admirably set forth in Chapter 20 of the report of the Royal Commission. . . . Stated briefly, their conclusion is that the attempt has failed, not from any fault on the part of the Administration, or from any hesitation in apply ing the mandate, but because the conflict between Arab and Jewish political aspirations, which was inherent in the situa tion from the first, has tended to be confirmed by certain pro visions of the mandate itself. It has, moreover, been intensified, not only by the estranging forces of conditions inside Palestine, but perhaps even more by external factors beyond the control o^Jhe British Administration in Palestine. ® These external factors fall into two main sections. Firstly, ^^here has been a growth of anti-semitism, and the development &lt;)f new economic and social conditions, in certain European countries, which have resulted in increased desire on the part of the Jews, and increased pressure on His Majesty’s Govern ment to find room in Palestine for largely increased numbers of Jewish refugees. Secondly, there has been the growth of Arab nationalism throughout the Arabic-speaking countries and their increasing concern in the future political destiny of Palestine. “ I am anxious to avoid over-statement, but I do wish to say, with all the emphasis in my power, that these new factors, which no one could have foreseen when the mandate was drawn up and approved by the Council, have transformed the whole situation and have created a new set of conditions under10 which the policy which was contemplated some two decades ago, and which we have done our utmost to carry out ever since, has become dehnitely unworkable. . . . “ That is the situation in which His Majesty's Government come to the Council to-day. Palestine is a mandated territory administered by Great Britain on behalf of the League. The Palestine problem is not merely one that concerns Arabs and Jews, or one for which His Majesty’s Government alone is required to find a solution. It is a problem that concerns the League as a whole. The mandatory Power can take no steps towards the modification of the mandatory regime without th^ authority of the League. His Majesty’s Government clearly can not proceed to work out the details of any scheme of partition, such as has been suggested by the Royal Commission, ur^s they are assured that they have the general approval of the Council in embarking on this task. It is for that general approval that I ask to-day. “ My colleagues will have seen the statement of policy issued by His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom at the time of the publication of the Royal Commission’s report. In that statement the opinion was recorded ‘ that a scheme of parti tion on the general lines recommended by the commission repre sents the best and most hopeful solution of the deadlock.’ To that opinion we adhere All I ask at this stage is that His Majesty’s Government shall be given authority to proceed forthwith to work out the details of such a scheme, if possible in co-operation with representatives of both Jews and Arabs, it being understood that no scheme will be put into effect without further reference to, and approval by, the Council. “ The procedure that His Majesty’s Government have in mind, if the Council give their general approval to the policy which I have outlined, is to appoint a further special body to visit Palestine, to negotiate with Arabs and Jews and**o submit to His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom proposals for a detailed scheme of partition. It would b^^ the task of this body to advise, in due course, as to the pro visional boundaries of the proposed Arab and Jewish States and of the new British mandated area, and also to undertake the financial and other enquiries for which the Royal Com mission recommended that a financial commission should be appointed. “ At a later stage, a final and detailed boundary demarca tion commission would need to be appointed “ In the view of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, partition is the only ultimate solution. It alone admits of the fulfilment both of Article 22 of the Covenant, which contemplates independence as the goal of all territoriesII in the category of ‘ A ’ mandates-, and of the obligation to establish in Palestine a national home for the Jewish people. What His Majesty’s Government contemplate is not a dual but a tripartite division of the country, for they take it from the terms of Article 28 of the existing mandate that it is the intention and wish of the League that the Holy Places, including the Christian Holy Places, should remain permanently under League supervision and control. The vast majority of the Christian Holy Places are in the three cities of Jerusalem, Bethlehem and Nazareth. The two latter are almost entirely Christian towns. In the old city of Jerusalem and its imme diate environs are not only many historic religious sites, but the religious settlements of many faiths. We think it will be ii*iccordance with the wishes of the vast majority of States Members of the League that, when contemplating the ultimate establishment of Jewish and Arab States in the Holy Land sacred to all three religions, these religious sites and institutions should be placed permanently in the care of a Power acting on behalf of and responsible to the League as a whole for what must always be a sacred trust ” 6. Council of the League. The Council of the League, on the 16 th September, 1937 , adopted the following resolution: — “ In view of the United Kingdom Government’s statement of July, 1937 , concerning the conclusions of the Royal Com mission on Palestine; “ In view of the preliminary opinion given to the Council by the Mandates Commission; “ In view of the statement made by the Representative of the United Kingdom at the Council meeting of September 14th, 1937, and the discussion on the status of Palestine which took place at the same meeting; S Having regard to the intention expressed by the United -Kingdom Government of pursuing the study of the problem %f the status of Palestine while concentrating on a solution involving partition of the territory; “ Recalling the assurances given in that connection by the Representative of the United Kingdom on the subject of immi gration ; “ The Council: “ Agrees to the United Kingdom Government’s carrying out the aforesaid study and taking such steps as it may entail; “ And, while pointing out that the Mandate of July 24th, 1922, remains in force until such time as it may be otherwise decided, defers consideration of the substance of the question until the Council is in a position to deal with it as a whole and in the meantime entirely reserves its opinion and its decision.'MBT' 12 7. Assembly of the League. The resolution adopted by the Assembly on the 30th Septem ber, 1937, reads as follows: — “ The Assembly, “ Having noted the activity of the mandatory Powers, the Permanent Mandates Commission and the Council concerning the application of the principles laid down in Article 22 of the Covenant and in the texts of the mandates: (a) Renews the expression of confidence in them voted by previous sessions of the Assembly, and pays a tribute to the results they have achieved thanks to a close an frank co-operation which it is essential to maintain; {b) Expresses its conviction that the problem^of Palestine, which is at present before the Council, will oe equitably settled, account being taken to the fullest possible extent of all the legitimate interests at stake.” 47121—29) Wt. 1866—3979 4040 1/38 P St. G, 335'POLICY IN PALESTINE Despatch dated 23rd December, 1937, from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the High Commissioner for Palestine Presented by the Secretary of State for the Colonies to Parliament by Command of His Majesty January, 1938 LONDON PRINTED AND PUBLISHED BY HIS MAJESTY’S STATIONERY OFFICE To be purchased directly from H.M.

A memo randum containing relevant extracts from the Statement ot Policy and the resolutions in question, and containing ;w extracts from Ministerial statements, is enclosed for convenience , of reference. 2. I feel that it is necessary to emphasize certain implications of the acceptance in principle by His Majesty’s Government of the recommendations contained in Part III of the Report of the Royal Commission,* and to dispel, if possible, the uncertainty which appears to exist in some quarters with regard to the course of action which His Majesty’s Government have in view. 3. In the Statement of Policy His Majesty’s Government have expressed their general agreement with the arguments and con clusions of the Royal Commission and their opinion that a scheme of tripartite division is the best and most hopeful solution of the problem. In view of the public attention that has been devoted to criticism of certain features of the tentative plan of partition which is outlined in Part III of the Report of the Royal Commission, I wish to make it clear that His Majesty’s Government are in no sense committed to approval of that plan, and in particular that they have not accepted the Commission’s proposal for the compulsory transfer in the last resort of And^ from the Jewish to the Arab area. 4. In the opinion of His Majesty’s Government the discussions Jfc at Geneva justify the undertaking of the further investigations required for the drawing up of a more precise scheme expressed in greater detail. The final decision cannot be taken in merely general terms, and the further enquiry will undoubtedly provide the necessary materials on which, when the best possible scheme has been formulated, to judge of its equity and practicability. ' 5. As you are aware, it has been announced that a further special body will be appointed to visit Palestine, and to submit to His Majesty’s Government, after consultation with the local communities, proposals for a detailed scheme of partition; and that it will be the task of this body to advise in due course as to the provisional boundaries of the proposed Arab and Jewish * Cmd. 5479 .A 2 47121 3 areas and of the new British Mandated area, and also to under take the financial and other enquiries for which the Royal Com mission recommended that a Financial Commission should be appointed. The functions of this new body will be to act as a technical Commission, that is to say, its functions will be con fined to ascertaining facts and to considering in detail the practical possibilities of a scheme of partition. 6 . The terms of reference of the technical Commission will be as follows: — “ Taking into account the plan of partition outlined in Part III of the Report of the Royal Commission, but with full liberty to suggest modifications of that plan, including variation of the areas recommended for retention under British Mandate, And taking into account any representations of the com munities in Palestine and Trans-Jordan— (i) to recommend boundaries for the proposed Arab and Jewish areas and the enclaves to be retained per manently or temporarily under British Mandate which will— (a) afford a reasonable prospect of the eventual establishment, with adequate security, of self-sup porting Arab and Jewish States; (b) necessitate the inclusion of the fewest pos sible Arabs and Arab enterprises in the Jewish area and vice versa; and (c) enable His Majesty's Government to carry out the Mandatory responsibilities the assumption of which is recommended in the Report of the Royal Commission, including the obligations im posed by Article 28 of the Mandate as regards the Holy Places; (ii) to examine and report on the economic and financial questions involved in partition upon which decisions will require to be taken, including— (а) the allocation so far as may be necessary between the various areas of the public assets and public debt of Palestine and other ‘ financial obligations legitimately incurred by the Adminis tration of Palestine during the period of the Mandate ' referred to in Article 28 thereof; ( б ) means to ensure that the financial obliga tions referred to above will be fully honoured in accordance with Article 28 of the Mandate; (c) the administration of the railways, ports, postal, telegraph and telephone services;■■■■■■ pSflMH 4 {d) currency arrangements; (e) customs administration and tariffs; (/) the budgetary prospects of the various Ad ministrations to be established; (g) the preservation of the rights of civil servants in accordance with the provisions of Article 28 of the Mandate; (h) the treatment of industrial and other con cessions ; ^ (t) the possibility of voluntary exchanges of land and population, and the prospects of providing by works of land development room for furtw settlement to meet the needs of persons desiring to move from one area to another; (;) the provision of effective safeguards for the rights of religious or racial minorities in the areas to be allocated to Arab and Jews respectively, including the protection of religious rights and properties.' 7 . If, as a result of the investigations of the technical Com mission, which will undoubtedly occupy many months, a scheme of partition is regarded as equitable and practicable by His Majesty's Government, it will be referred to the Council of the League for consideration. If the scheme is approved by the League Council, a further period will be required for the establishment of new systems of government under mandate in the areas concerned and, if the necessary consent is forth coming, for the negotiation of treaties with a view to the eventual establishment of independent States. It may also be necessary, in the light of the Commission’s report, for His Majesty’s Government to give further consideration to the suggestion ^ the Permanent Mandates Commission that the Arab and Jewish areas should be administered temporarily under a system of ^ “ cantonisation ' or under separate mandates. It is obvious, therefore, that, for some time to come, any action taken will be only of an exploratory nature. 8 . I will communicate with you further in due course on the subject of the personnel of the Commission and its procedure. I have, &amp;c., W. ORMSBY GORE High Commissioner, General Sir Arthur Wauchope, G.C.M.G., K.C.B., C.I.E., D.S.O., etc., etc., etc.5 SUMMARY OF RECENT STATEMENTS AND RESOLUTIONS 1. Statement of Policy. In the Statement of Policy of July, 1937 (Cmd. ^ was stated that His Majesty’s Government had been driven to the conclusion “ that a scheme of partition on the general lines recommended by the Commission represents the best and most hopeful solution of the deadlock ” 0K “ His Majesty’s Government, therefore, propose to take such steps as are necessary and appropriate .... to obtain freedom to give effect to a scheme of partition, to which they earnestly J^pe that it may be possible to secure an effective^ measure of consent on the part of the communities concerned.” 2. Parliament. The House of Commons, on the 21st July, 1937 , passed a resolution to the following effect: — “ That the proposals contained in Command Paper No. 5513 relating to Palestine should be brought before the League of Nations with a view to enabling His Majesty’s Government, after adequate enquiry, to present to Parlia ment a definite scheme taking into full account all the recommendations of the Command Paper.” 3. Statements by Mr. Ormsby Gore before Perma?ient Mandates Commission. “ What I ask is that you should advise the Council that, in the light of our experience and our knowledge of Palestine, a solution on the lines of partition should be explored as the best and most hopeful solution of what the mandatory Power is itself convinced is, in fact, a deadlock. I do not ask you to approve a scheme of partition, or to settle these questions of defence, Minorities, &amp;c. All I ask you is to recommend that the door 3 nould not be closed to a solution by partition. I ask you to ^ open the door and not to close it. I do not ask the Mandates Commission to commit itself finally, but to allow the mandatory Power to explore the solution which it thinks best in the circum stances, and to produce for the League in due course a more definite scheme for your later consideration.” (Minutes of Thirty-Second Session, pp. 37-38-) * * * * “ it was his belief that, in view of the actual wording of the Royal Commission’s report, and in view of the mandatoiy Power’s declaration that a deadlock had arisen and that its hopes of seeing Palestine evolve into a self-governing State, where Jews and Arabs would have reconciled their differences, had not been fulfilled, and in view of the fact that neighbouring6 Arab States had intervened, and in view of all the efforts sincerely made to work the mandate as drafted, he was satisfied that no British Government could administer Palestine on the basis of the existing mandate without considerable alterations.” (Minutes, p. 169 .) * * * * “ The idea that it would be open to the United Kingdom or any other Power to carry on the existing mandate was an idea in which he hoped the Mandates Commission would not take refuge. He said frankly, not speaking for himself, bu(j® speaking on behalf of the United Kingdom Government, that the prospects of carrying on indefinitely on the terms of the existing mandate seemed to His Majesty’s Government to a commitment involving repression, involving continual friction and hostility between each of the two races, on the one hand, and the Administration on the other, as well as between the two races themselves, in a manner which could not inure to the advantage of any one of the three parties concerned—or, for that matter, to the credit of the mandate system or of the League itself. “ Mr. Ormsby Gore was satisfied that a new solution—a political solution, as he had described it—of the problem of Palestine must be explored in the interests of the future peace of Palestine, and, further, in the wider interest of the future relations between the Jews and the world of Islam, for the benefit of the suffering Jews in Europe, as well as for the benefit of the peace of the world. It was in the light of these broad political considerations that he came before the Mandates Com mission, not as an administrator, but quite frankly as a politician, to say that, in his opinion, and in the opinion of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, it was essential that a solution of what they regarded quite definitely as a deadlock should be explored.” (Minutes, pp. 184 - 185 .) ^ * * * * ^ [Mr. Ormsby Gore] had certainly had no intention of con- ^ veying the impression that the Balfour Declaration was not still a binding obligation on both the League and the United Kingdom. Obviously, like the mandate, it was still a binding obligation, and would remain so until replaced by an in dependent Jewish State. It was only if the suggested plan of partition were accepted, and eventuated in the creation of a Jewish State, that the Balfour Declaration would reach its fruition and cease to be binding. Similarly, the mandate was binding until it was replaced by another regime in Palestine.” (Minutes, p. 182 .) * * * * ” The Mandates Commission would see that the solution re commended by the Arab Higher Committee implied: first, theretention by the Arabs of the right to complete independence in their own land, which they described as the whole of Palestine; second, the cessation (whatever that meant) of the experiment of the Jewish National Home; third, the cessation of the British mandate and its replacement by a treaty similar to those existing between the United Kingdom and Iraq, the United Kingdom and Egypt, and France and Syria, constitut ing Palestine a sovereign State; and, fourth, the immediate cessation of all Jewish immigration and of land sales to Jews pending the conclusion of the treaty. That solution, Mr. T)rmsby Gore wished to say, quite frankly, was unacceptable to the United Kingdom Government if it were for the whole oO^alestine.' (Minutes, p. 191.) * * * * “ I take it that the basic principle of any partition scheme would be to leave as few Jews as possible in the Arab State; indeed, even under the proposals of the Royal Commission, that seems to be the main basis upon which it has acted, and would, I believe, be the only possible basis on which a frontier could be drawn. But, however you draw that frontier, it is inevitable that there will be a large Arab minority in the Jewish State, and it is therefore politically wise, and indeed necessary, that special provisions should be made for the legitimate safeguard ing of the interests of that minority. And again, on the other side, though an appreciable number of the Christians will be in the proposed British mandatory enclave, there will be, in the proposed Arab State, however you draw that frontier, a con siderable number of Christians.” (Minutes, p. 37.) “ Therefore, I grant that provisions for safeguarding minori ties will have to be made over and above the ordinary pro- P ’ ions which are made in the ordinary minorities treaties a Crating under League auspices in many countries in ^Europe. ... I see no reason why, in the case of Palestine, we should be strictly limited to the kind of procedure which operates in those European States.” (Minutes, p. 37.) 4. Permanent Mandates Commission. The Report of the Permanent Mandates Commission to the Council of the League on the work of its Thirty-second (Extra ordinary) Session contains the following conclusions: — “ The Commission therefore considers that it is worth con tinuing the examination of the advantages and drawbacks of a new territorial solution. It appears quite natural and legiti mate that the mandatory Power, rightly anxious to give satis faction to the conflicting aspirations of Arabs and Jews in Palestine, and having failed to do so by the institution of acommon administration for the whole territory, should powered to contemplate in some form or other the establish ment of a regime in which these aspirations would each be satisfied in a part of the territory. . t , “ This satisfaction cannot, of course, be complete, bor the Arabs, any partition must necessarily involve the abandonment of a fraction of what they consider to be their hereditary patrimony. For the Jews, it could involve, together with a restriction of the scope of their national home, already limited, as they allege, by the exclusion of Trans-Jordan in 1922, a fresh reduction in its capacity of absorbing population. “ Any solution to prove acceptable should therefore deprive the Arabs of as small a number as possible of the placebo which they attach particular value, either because they are tT~ir present homes or for reasons of religion. And, further, the areas allotted to the Jews should be sufficiently extensive, fertile and well situated from the point of view of communications by sea and land to be capable of intensive economic development, and consequently of dense and rapid settlement. . . . “ The Commission would be failing in its duty if it did not draw the Council’s attention to the delicate problem of the transfer of populations from one territory to the other which might be necessary if there was a partition. In order to guarantee that the advantages of such a transfer should out weigh the disadvantages, particular care would have to be given to ensure that it was carried out with the greatest fairness. “ As regards the proposal to withdraw the Holy Places from the domination of Arabs and Jews and place them under a special regime, the Commission thinks that such a step could not but be of advantage to general peace, provided that this regime was based on Article 28 of the present mandate. ... “ While declaring itself favourable in principle to an examina tion of a solution involving the partition of Palestine, the Cmaa- mission is, nevertheless, opposed to the idea of the immed^^e creation of two new independent States. ... 0, “ The Commission therefore considers that a prolongation of the period of political apprenticeship constituted by the man date would be absolutely essential both to the new Arab State and to the new Jewish State. This apprenticeship might be carried on in one of two forms. “ Provisional cantonization ” and “ Two Mandates ” are then discussed. 5. Extracts from the Speech of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs at the q8th Session of the Council of the League of Nations, on the 14th September, 1937. “ I would remind the Council that the Balfour Declaration itself had a dual character. On the one hand, it provided forthe Jewish national home, on the other it laid down the con dition that nothing should be done which might prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine or the rights or political status enjoyed by Jews elsewhere. “ It is clear that under these provisions a twofold task was imposed upon the mandatory Power. It was under an obliga tion to further the establishment of the Jewish national home, and at the same time it was bound to do its best to guide the f puntry as a whole along the path towards full nationhood, ndeed, the development of self-governing institutions is one of the objects specifically prescribed in Article 2 of the mandate. ® At the time when the mandate was drawn up by our pre- de^ssors it was clearly not contemplated that these two obliga tions would prove mutually incompatible. . . . No one, least of all the mandatory Power itself, or the Council of the League, who approved the form of the mandate, anticipated that the future would be entirely free from difficulties. But it was hoped that the two races in Palestine would so adjust their national aspirations as to render possible the establishment^ of a single self-governing commonwealth under a unitary Government. This hope has, unfortunately, not been fulfilled. The reasons for its non-fulfilment are admirably set forth in Chapter 20 of the report of the Royal Commission. . . . Stated briefly, their conclusion is that the attempt has failed, not from any fault on the part of the Administration, or from any hesitation in apply ing the mandate, but because the conflict between Arab and Jewish political aspirations, which was inherent in the situa tion from the first, has tended to be confirmed by certain pro visions of the mandate itself. It has, moreover, been intensified, not only by the estranging forces of conditions inside Palestine, but perhaps even more by external factors beyond the control cijhe British Administration in Palestine. ^ These external factors fall into two main sections. Firstly, ®there has been a growth of anti-semitism, and the development of new economic and social conditions, in certain European countries, which have resulted in increased desire on the part of the Jews, and increased pressure on His Majesty’s Govern ment to find room in Palestine for largely increased numbers of Jewish refugees. Secondly, there has been the growth of Arab nationalism throughout the Arabic-speaking countries and their increasing concern in the future political destiny of Palestine. “ I am anxious to avoid over-statement, but I do wish to say, with all the emphasis in my power, that these new factors, which no one could have foreseen when the mandate was drawn up and approved by the Council, have transformed the whole situation and have created a new set of conditions under10 which the policy which was contemplated some two decades ago, and which we have done our utmost to carry out ever since, has become definitely unworkable. . . . “ That is the situation in which His Majesty’s Government come to the Council to-day. Palestine is a mandated territory administered by Great Britain on behalf of the League. I he Palestine problem is not merely one that concerns Arabs and Jews, or one for which His Majesty’s Government alone is required to find a solution. It is a problem that concerns the League as a whole. The mandatory Power can take no stej^ towards the modification of the mandatory regime without the authority of the League. His Majesty’s Government clearly can not proceed to work out the details of any scheme of partit^i, such as has been suggested by the Royal Commission, umess they are assured that they have the general approval of the Council in embarking on this task. It is for that general approval that I ask to-day. “ My colleagues will have seen the statement of policy issued by His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom at the time of the publication of the Royal Commission’s report. In that statement the opinion was recorded ‘ that a scheme of parti tion on the general lines recommended by the commission repre sents the best and most hopeful solution of the deadlock.’ To that opinion we adhere All I ask at this stage is that His Majesty’s Government shall be given authority to proceed forthwith to work out the details of such a scheme, if possible in co-operation with representatives of both Jews and Arabs, it being understood that no scheme will be put into effect without further reference to, and approval by, the Council. “The procedure that His Majesty’s Government have in mind, if the Council give their general approval to the policy which I have outlined, is to appoint a further special ba^ to visit Palestine, to negotiate with Arabs and Jews andjo submit to His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdon^fc proposals for a detailed scheme of partition. It would be the task of this body to advise, in due course, as to the pro visional boundaries of the proposed Arab and Jewish States and of the new British mandated area, and also to undertake the financial and other enquiries for which the Royal Com mission recommended that a financial commission should be appointed. “ At a later stage, a final and detailed boundary demarca tion commission would need to be appointed “ In the view of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, partition is the only ultimate solution. It alone admits of the fulfilment both of Article 22 of the Covenant, which contemplates independence as the goal of all territories, II in the category of ‘ A ’ mandates,- and of the obligation to establish in Palestine a national home for the Jewish people. “ What His Majesty’s Government contemplate is not a dual but a tripartite division of the country, for they take it from the terms of Article 28 of the existing mandate that it is the intention and wish of the League that the Holy Places, including the Christian Holy Places, should remain permanently under League supervision and control. The vast majority of the Christian Holy Places are in the three cities of Jerusalem, ^Bethlehem and Nazareth. The two latter are almost entirely ^hristian towns. In the old city of Jerusalem and its imme diate environs are not only many historic religious sites, but th^religious settlements of many faiths. We think it will be iiHccordance with the wishes of the vast majority of States Members of the League that, when contemplating the ultimate establishment of Jewish and Arab States in the Holy Land sacred to all three religions, these religious sites and institutions should be placed permanently in the care of a Power acting on behalf of and responsible to the League as a whole for what must always be a sacred trust ” 6 . Council of the League. The Council of the League, on the 16 th September, I937&gt; adopted the following resolution: — “ In view of the United Kingdom Government’s statement of July, 1937 , concerning the conclusions of the Royal Com mission on Palestine; “ In view of the preliminary opinion given to the Council by the Mandates Commission; “ In view of the statement made by the Representative of the United Kingdom at the Council meeting of September 14 th, 1937 , and the discussion on the status of Palestine which took nijpe at the same meeting; Having regard to the intention expressed by the United ^Kingdom Government of pursuing the study of the problem of the status of Palestine while concentrating on a solution involving partition of the territory; “ Recalling the assurances given in that connection by the Representative of the United Kingdom on the subject of immi gration ; “ The Council: “ Agrees to the United Kingdom Government’s carrying out the aforesaid study and taking such steps as it may entail; “ And, while pointing out that the Mandate of July 24 th, 1922 , remains in force until such time as it may be otherwise decided, defers consideration of the substance of the question until the Council is in a position to deal with it as a whole and in the meantime entirely reserves its opinion and its decision.”7 . Assembly of the League. The resolution adopted by the Assembly on the 30 th Septem ber, 1937 , reads as follows: — “ The Assembly, “ Having noted the activity of the mandatory Powers, the Permanent Mandates Commission and the Council concerning the application of the principles laid down in Article 22 of the Covenant and in the texts of the mandates: “ {a) Renews the expression of confidence in them voted by previous sessions of the Assembly, and pays a tribut^ to tne results they have achieved thanks to a close ana frank co-operation which it is essential to maintain; “ ( 6 ) Expresses its conviction that the problem A Palestine, which is at present before the Council, will be equitably settled, account being taken to the fullest possible extent of all the legitimate interests at stake.' 47121—29) Wt. 1866—3979 4040 1/38 P. st.

They are now faced with problem of finding alternative means of meetings the needs of different situation described by Royal Comnission which will be consistant with their obligations to Arabs and Jews. His Majesty’s Government believe it is possible to find these alternative means. They have already given much thought to problem in the light of report of Royal Conraission and of partition Comaiission it is clear that surest foundation for peace and progress of Palestine would be an understanding between Arabs and Jews and His Majesty’s Government are prepared in the first instance to make a determined effort for such understanding with this and in view they propose imnediate ly to invite representatives of Palestinian Arabs and of neighbouring/ r* r ^ States on the one hand and of Jewish Agency on the other* to confer with them as soon as possible in London regarding future policy including question of immigration// into fcia Palestine, As regards representation of Palestinian resources Arabs His Majesty’s Government must reserve the right to refuse to receive those leaders whom they regard as responsible for compaign of assasination and voilance. Paragraph 6. His Majesty’s Government hope that these discussions in London may help to promote agreement as to future policy re^rding Palestine, They attach great importance however to a decision being reached a t an early date. Therefore if London discussions should not produce agreement within a reasonable period of time they will taice their own decision in the light of their examination of problem and of discussions in London and annouce policy which they propose to pursue.

It was their sincere hope that, as a result of full, free and frank discussion, some under standing might be reached. Conferences recently took place with Arab and Jewish delegations, lasting for a period of several weeks, and served the purpose of a complete exchange of views between British Ministers and the Arab and Jewish representatives. In the light of the discussions as well as of the situation in Palestine and of the Reports of the Royal Com mission! and the Partition Commission^, certain proposals were formulated by His Majesty’s Government and were laid before the Arab and Jewish delegations as the basis of an agr£l settlement. Neither the Arab nor the Jewish delegations mlt able to accept these proposals, and the conferences therefore did not result in an agreement. Accordingly His Majesty’s Government are free to formulate their own policy, and after careful consideration they have decided to adhere generally to the proposals which were finally submitted to, and discussed with, the Arab and Jewish delegations. 2 . The Mandate for Palestine, the terms of which were con firmed by the Council of the League of Nations in 1922 , has governed the policy of successive British Governments for nearly 20 years. It embodies the Balfour Declaration and im poses on the Mandatory four main obligations. These obliga tions are set out in Articles 2 , 6 and 13 of the Mandate. There is no dispute regarding the interpretation of one of these obliga tions, that touching the protection of and access to the Hohg^ Places and religious buildings or sites. The other three maiii obligations are generally as follows: — (i) To place the country under such political, adminis trative and economic conditions as will secure the estab lishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jew® people, to facilitate Jewish immigration under suitable conditions, and to encourage, in co-operation with the Jewish Agency, close settlement by Jews on the land. (ii) To safeguard the civil and religious rights of all the inhabitants of Palestine irrespective of race and religion, and, whilst facilitating Jewish immigration and settlement, to ensure that the rights and position of other sections of the population are not prejudiced. (in) To place the country under such political, adminis trative and economic conditions as will secure the develop- mentof self-governing institutions. * Cmd. 5893 . f Cmd. 5479 . fCmd. 5854 .''•I r 3 3 . The Royal Commission and previous Commissions of Enquiry have drawn attention to the ambiguity of certain ex pressions in the Mandate, such as the expression “ a national home for the Jewish people ”, and they have found in this ambiguity and the resulting uncertainty as to the objectives of policy a fundamental cause of unrest and hostility between Arabs and Jews. His Majesty’s Government are convinced that in the interests of the peace and well-being of the whole people of Palestine a clear definition of policy and objectives is essential. The proposal of partition recommended by the Royal Commission would have afforded such clarity, but the establishment of self-supporting independent Arab and Jewish States within Palestine has been found to be impracticable. It has therefore been necessary for His Majesty’s Government to devise an alternative policy which will, consistently with their obligations to Arabs and Jews, meet the 1 jds of the situation in Palestine. Their views and proposals are set forth below under the three heads, (I) The Constitution, (II) Immigration, and (III) Land. I.—The Constitution. 4 . It has been urged that the expression “ a national home for the Jewish people ” offered a prospect that Palestine might in due course become a Jewish State or Commonwealth. His Majesty’s Government do not wish to contest the view, which was expressed by the Royal Commission, that the Zionist leaders at the time of the issue of the Balfour Declaration recognised that an ultimate Jewish State was not precluded by the terms of the Declaration. But, with the Royal Commission, His Majesty’s Government believe that the framers of the ^^andate in which the Balfour Declaration was embodied could not have intended that Palestine should be converted into a Jewish State against the will of the Arab population of the country. That Palestine was not to be converted into a Jewish State might be held to be implied in the passage from the ^mmand Paper of 1922 * which reads as follows: — “ Unauthorised statements have been made to the effect that the purpose in view is to create a wholly Jewish Pales tine. Phrases have been used such as that ‘ Palestine is to become as Jewish as England is English . His Majesty s Government regard any such expectation as impracticable and have no such aim in view. Nor have they at any time contemplated the disappearance or the subordination of the Arabic population, language or culture in Palestine. They would draw attention to the fact that the terms of the (Balfour) Declaration referred to do not contemplate that Palestine as a whole should be converted into a * Cmd. 1700 . 16379 A 24 Jewish National Home, but that such a Home should be founded in Palestine ”. But this statement has not removed doubts, and His Majesty’s Government therefore now declare unequivocally that it is not part of their policy that Palestine should become a Jewish State. They would indeed regard it as contrary to their obligations to the Arabs under the Mandate, as well as to the assurances which have been given to the Arab people in the past, that the Arab population of Palestine should be made the subjects of a Jewish State against their will. 5 . The nature of the Jewish National Home in Palestine was further described in the Command Paper of 1922 as follows: — “ During the last two or three generations the Jews have recreated in Palestine a community, now numbering 80 , 000 , of whom about one-fourth are farmers or workers upon land. This community has its own political organs; an elected assembly for the direction of its domestic concerns; elected councils in the towns; and an organisation for the control of its schools. It has its elected Chief Rabbinate and Rabbinical Council for the direction of its religious affairs. Its business is conducted in Hebrew as a ver nacular language, and a Hebrew press serves its needs. It has its distinctive intellectual life and displays considerable economic activity. This community, then, with its town and country population, its political, religious and social organisations, its own language, its own customs, its own life, has in fact ‘ national ’ characteristics. When it is asked what is meant by the development of the Jewish National Home in Palestine, it may be answered that it is not the imposition of a Jewish nationality upon the a. inhabitants of Palestine as a whole, but the further develop-^^ ment of the existing Jewish community, with the assistance of Jews in other parts of the world, in order that it may become a centre in which the Jewish people as a whole may take, on grounds of religion and race, an interest a^ a pride. But in order that this community should have the best prospect of free development and provide a full opportunity for the Jewish people to display its capacities, it is essential that it should know that it is in Palestine as of right and not on sufferance. That is the reason why it is necessary that the existence of a Jewish National Home in Palestine should be internationally guaranteed, and that it should be formally recognised to rest upon ancient historic connection ”. 6 . His Majesty’s Government adhere to this interpretation of the Declaration of 1917 and regard it as an authoritative and comprehensive description of the character of the Jewish National Home in Palestine. It envisaged the further development of the existing Jewish community with the5 assistance of Jews in other parts of the world. Evidence that His Majesty's Government have been carrying out their obliga tion in this respect is to be found in the facts that, since the statement of 1922 was published, more than 300,000 Jews have immigrated to Palestine, and that the population of the National Home has risen to some 450 , 000 , or approaching a third of the entire population of the country. Nor has the Jewish com munity failed to take full advantage of the opportunities given to it. The growth of the Jewish National Home and its achieve ments in many fields are a remarkable constructive effort which must command the admiration of the world and must be, in particular, a source of pride to the Jewish people. 7 . In the recent discussions the Arab delegations have repeated the contention that Palestine was included within the area in which Sir Henry McMahon, on behalf of the British ^)vernment, in October, 1915 , undertook to recognise and support Arab independence. The validity of this claim, based on the terms of the correspondence which passed between Sir Henry McMahon and the Sharif of Mecca, was thoroughly and carefully investigated by British and Arab representatives during the recent conferences in London. Their Report, which has been published,* states that both the Arab and the British representatives endeavoured to understand the point of view of the other party but that they were unable to reach agreement upon an interpretation of the correspondence. There is no need to summarise here the arguments presented by each side. His Majesty's Government regret the misunderstandings which have arisen as regards some of the phrases used, bor their part they can only adhere, for the reasons given by their representatives in the Report, to the view that the whole ^i^of Palestine west of Jordan was excluded from Sir Henry McMahon’s pledge, and they therefore cannot agree that the McMahon correspondence forms a just basis for the claim that Palestine should be converted into an Arab State. ^ 8 . His Majesty’s Government are charged as the Mandatory ithority “ to secure the development of self-governing institu tions ” in Palestine. Apart from this specific obligation, they would regard it as contrary to the whole spirit of the Mandate system that the population of Palestine should remain for ever under Mandatory tutelage. It is proper that the people of the country should as early as possible enjoy the rights of self- government which are exercised by the people of neighbouring countries. His Majesty’s Government are unable at present to foresee the exact constitutional forms which government in Palestine will eventually take, but their objective is self-govern ment, and they desire to see established ultimately an indepen dent Palestine State. It should be a State in which the two4^ peoples in Palestine, Arabs and Jews, share authority in government in such a way that the essential interests ot each are secured. 9 . The establishment of $.n independent State and the c 01 Ji- plete relinquishment of Mandatory control in Palestine would require such relations between the Arabs and the Jews as would make good government possible. Moreover, the growth of self-governing institutions in Palestine, as in other countries, must be an evolutionary process. A transitional period will be required before independence is achieved, throughout which ultimate responsibility for the Government of the country will be retained by His Majesty’s Government as the Mandatory authority, while the people of the country are taking an increasing share in the Government, and understanding and co-operation amongst them are growing. It will be tk| constant endeavour of His Majesty’s Government to prom^^ good relations between the Arabs and the Jews. 10 . In the light of these considerations His Majesty’s Govern ment make the following declaration of their intentions regard ing the future government of Palestine: — ( 1 ) The objective of His Majesty’s Government is the establishment within ten years of an independent Palestine State in such treaty relations with the United Kingdom as will provide satisfactorily for the commercial and strategic requirements of both countries in the future. This proposal for the establishment of the independent State would involve consultation with the Council of the League of Nations with a view to the termination of the Mandate. ( 2 ) The independent State should be one in which Arabs and Jews share in government in such a way as to ensurq^ that the essential interests of each community are safe guarded. ( 3 ) The establishment of the independent State will be preceded by a transitional period throughout which Hj| Majesty’s Government will retain responsibility for W government of the country. During the transitional period the people of Palestine will be given an increasing part in the government of their country. Both sections of the population will have an opportunity to participate in the machinery of government, and the process will be carried on whether or not they both avail themselves of it. ( 4 ) As soon as peace and order have been sufficiently restored in Palestine steps will be taken to carry out this policy of giving the people of Palestine an increasing part in the government of their country, the objective being to place Palestinians in charge of all the Departments of Government, with the assistance of British advisers and7 subject to the control of the High Commissioner. With this object in view His Majesty’s Government will be prepared immediately to arrange that Palestinians shall be placed in charge of certain Departments, with British advisers. The Palestinian heads of Departments will sit on the Executive Council, which advises the High Commissioner. Arab and Jewish representatives will be invited to serve as heads of Departments approximately in proportion to their respec tive populations. The number of Palestinians in charge of Departments will be increased as circumstances permit until all heads of Departments are Palestinians, exercising the administrative and advisory functions which are at present performed by British officials. When that stage is reached consideration will be given to the question of converting the Executive Council into a Council of Ministers with a consequential change in the status and functions of the Palestinian heads of Departments. ( 5 ) His Majesty’s Government make no proposals at this stage regarding the establishment of an elective legislature. Nevertheless they would regard this as an appropriate constitutional development, and, should public opinion in Palestine hereafter show itself in favour of such a develop ment, they will be prepared, provided that local conditions permit, to establish the necessary machinery. ( 6 ) At the end of five years from the restoration of peace and order, an appropriate body representative of the people of Palestine and of His Majesty’s Government will be set up to review the working of the constitutional arrangements during the transitional period and to consider and make recommendations regarding the constitution of A the independent Palestine State. ( 7 ) His Majesty’s Government will require to be satisfied that in the treaty contemplated by sub-paragraph ( 1 ) or in the constitution contemplated by sub-paragraph ( 6 ) ^ adequate provision has been made for: — (а) the security of, and freedom of access to, the Holy Places, and the protection of the interests and property of the various religious bodies. ( б ) the protection of the different communities in Palestine in accordance with the obligations of His Majesty’s Government to both Arabs and Jews and for the special position in Palestine of the Jewish National Home. (c) such requirements to meet the strategic situation as may be regarded as necessary by His Majesty’s Government in the light of the circumstances then existing.mm 8 His Majesty’s Government will also require to be satisfied that the interests of certain foreign countries in Palestine, for the preservation of which they are at present responsible, are adequately safeguarded. ( 8 ) His Majesty’s Government will do everything in their power to create conditions which will enable the independent Palestine State to come into being within ten years. If, at the end of ten years, it appears to His Majesty’s Government that, contrary to their hope, circumstances require the postponement of the establish ment of the independent State, they will consult with representatives of the people of Palestine, the Council of the League of Nations and the neighbouring Arab States before deciding on such a postponement. If His Majesty’s Government come to the conclusion that postponement is unavoidable, they will invite the co-operation of th*N parties in framing plans for the future with a view 10 achieving the desired objective at the earliest possible date. n. During the transitional period steps will be taken to increase the powers and responsibilities of municipal corpora tions and local councils. II.—Immigration. 12 . Under Article 6 of the Mandate, the Administration of Palestine, “ while ensuring that the rights and position of other sections of the population are not prejudiced ”, is required to “ facilitate Jewish immigration under suitable conditions ”. Beyond this, the extent to which Jewish immigration into Pales tine is to be permitted is nowhere defined in the Mandate. But in the Command Paper of 1922 it was laid down that for the^ fulfilment of the policy of establishing a Jewish National Home “it is necessary that the Jewish community in Palestine should be able to increase its numbers by immigration. This immigration cannot be so great in volume as to exceed whatever may be the economic capacity of the country^' the time to absorb new arrivals. It is essential to ensure that the immigrants should not be a burden upon the people of Palestine as a whole, and that they should not deprive any section of the present population of their employment.” In practice, from that date onwards until recent times, the economic absorptive capacity of the country has been treated as the sole limiting factor, and in the letter which Mr. Ramsay MacDonald, as Prime Minister, sent to Dr. Weizmann in February 1931 * it was laid down as a matter of policy that economic absorptive capacity was the sole criterion. This interpretation has been supported by resolutions of * Hansard, Vol. 248 , 13 / 2 / 31 , Cols. 751 - 7 .MKgfM *k the Permanent Mandates Commission. But His Majesty’s Government do not read either the Statement of Policy of 1922 or the letter of 1931 as implying that the Mandate requires them, for all time and in all circumstances, to facilitate the immi gration of Jews into Palestine subject only to consideration of the country’s economic absorptive capacity. Nor do they find anything in the Mandate or in subsequent Statements of Policy to support the view that the establishment of a Jewish National Home in Palestine cannot be effected unless immigration is allowed to continue indefinitely. If immigration has an adverse effect on the economic position in the country, it should clearly be restricted; and equally, if it has a seriously damaging effect on the political position in the country, that is a factor that should not be ignored. Although it is not difficult to contend that the large number of Jewish immigrants who have been ^knitted so far have been absorbed economically, the fear c^the Arabs that this influx will continue indefinitely until the Jewish population is in a position to dominate them has pro duced consequences which are extremely grave for Jews and Arabs alike and for the peace and prosperity of Palestine. The lamentable disturbances of the past three years are only the latest and most sustained manifestation of this intense Arab apprehension. The methods employed by Arab terrorists against fellow-Arabs and Jews alike must receive unqualified condemnation. But it cannot be denied that tear of indefinite Jewish immigration is widespread amongst the Arab population and that this fear has made possible disturb ances which have given a serious setback to economic progress, depleted the Palestine exchequer, rendered life and property insecure, and produced a bitterness between the Arab and ^Jewish populations which is deplorable between citizens of ^The same country. If in these circumstances immigration is continued up to the economic absorptive capacity of the country, regardless of all other considerations, a fatal enmity between the two peoples will be perpetuated, and the situation in Palestine Ay become a permanent source of friction amongst all peoples **6 Near and Middle East. His Majesty’s Government can not take the view that either their obligations under the Mandate, or considerations of common sense and justice, require that they should ignore these circumstances in framing immigration policy. 13 . In the view of the Royal Commission, the association of the policy of the Balfour Declaration with the Mandate system implied the belief that Arab hostility to the former would sooner or later be overcome. It has been the hope of British Govern ments ever since the Balfour Declaration was issued that in time the Arab population, recognizing the advantages to. be derived from Jewish settlement and development in Palestine, would become reconciled to the further growth of the Jewish10 National Home. This hope has not been fulfilled. The alterna tives before His Majesty’s Government are either (i) to seek to expand the Jewish National Home indefinitely by immigration, against the strongly expressed will of the Arab people of the country; or (ii) to permit further expansion of the Jewish National Home by immigration only if the Arabs are prepared to acquiesce in it. The former policy means rule by force. Apart from other considerations, such a policy seems to His Majesty’s Government to be contrary to the whole spirit of Article 22 of the Covenant of the League of Nations, as well as to their specific obligations to the Arabs in the Palestine Mandate. Moreover, the relations between the Arabs and the Jews in Palestine must be based sooner or later on mutual tolerance and goodwill; the peace, security and progress of the Jewish National Home itself require this. Therefore His Majesty’s Government, after earnest consideration, and taku^ into account the extent to which the growth of the Jew^-i National Home has been facilitated over the last twenty years, have decided that the time has come to adopt in principle the second of the alternatives referred to above. 14 . It has been urged that all further Jewish immigration into Palestine should be stopped forthwith. His Majesty’s Govern ment cannot accept such a proposal. It would damage the whole of the financial and economic system of Palestine and thus affect adversely the interests of Arabs and Jews alike. Moreover, in the view of His Majesty’s Government, abruptly to stop further immigration would be unjust to the Jewish National Home. But, above all, His Majesty’s Government are con scious of the present unhappy plight of large numbers of Jews who seek a refuge from certain European countries, and they believe that Palestine can and should make a further con tribution to the solution of this pressing world problem. In all these circumstances, they believe that they will be acting consistently with their Mandatory obligations to both Arabs and Jews, and in the manner best calculated to serve the interestsM the whole people of Palestine, by adopting the followm 0 proposals regarding immigration: — ( 1 ) Jewish immigration during the next five years will be at a rate which, if economic absorptive capacity per mits, will bring the Jewish population up to approximately one-third of the total population of the country. Taking into account the expected natural increase of the Arab and Jewish populations, and the number of illegal Jewish immigrants now in the country, this would allow of the admission, as from the beginning of April this year, of some 75,000 immigrants oyer the next five years. These immigrants would, subject toII $&gt; the criterion of economic absorptive capacity, be admitted as follows: — (a) For each of the next five years a quota of 10,000 Jewish immigrants will be allowed, on the under standing that a shortage in any one year may be added to the quotas for subsequent years, within the five- year period, if economic absorptive capacity permits. (b) In addition, as a contribution towards the solution of the Jewish refugee problem, 25,000 refugees will be admitted as soon as the High Commissioner is satisfied that adequate provision for their maintenance is ensured, special consideration being given to refugee children and dependants. ( 2 ) The existing machinery for ascertaining economic absorptive capacity will be retained, and the High Com missioner will have the ultimate responsibility for deciding the limits of economic capacity. Before each periodic decision is taken, Jewish and Arab representatives will be consulted. ( 3 ) After the period of five years no further Jewish immigration will be permitted unless the Arabs of Palestine are prepared to acquiesce in it. ( 4 ) His Majesty's Government are determined to check illegal immigration, and further preventive measures are being adopted. The numbers of any Jewish illegal immi grants who, despite these measures, may succeed in coming into the country and cannot be deported will be deducted from the yearly quotas. 15 . His Majesty's Government are satisfied that, when the ^immigration over five years which is now contemplated has taken place, they will not be justified in facilitating, nor will they be under any obligation to facilitate, the further develop ment of the Jewish National Home by immigration regardless of the wishes of the Arab population. III.—Land. 16 . The Administration of Palestine is required, under Article 6 of the Mandate, “ while ensuring that the rights and position of other sections of the population are not prejudiced ', to encourage ' close settlement by Jews on the land ', and no restriction has been imposed hitherto on the transfer of land from Arabs to Jews. The Reports of several expert Commissions have indicated that, owing to the natural growth of the Arab population and the steady sale in recent years of Arab land to Jews, there is now in certain areas no room for further transfers of Arab land, whilst in some other areas such transfers of land12 must be restricted if Arab cultivators are to maintain their existing standard of life and a considerable landless Arab popu lation is not soon to be created. In these circumstances, the High Commissioner will be giv^n general powers to prohibit and regulate transfers land.-. ’These .powers will date from the publication of this statement of policjf and the High Commis sioner will retain them throughout, the^ transitional period. 17 . The policy of the Government will be directed towards the development of the land and the improvement, where possible, of methods of cultivation. In the light of such develop ment it will be open to the High Commissioner, should he be satisfied thalj the ‘ ‘ rights and position ' ’ of the Arab population will be duly preserved, to review and modify any orders passed relating to the prohibition or restriction of the transfer of land. 18 . In framing these proposals His Majesty's Governme have sincerely endeavoured to act in strict accordance with their obligations under the Mandate to both the Arabs and the Jews. The vagueness of the phrases employed in some instances to describe these obligations has led to controversy and has made the task of interpretation difficult. His Majesty's Government cannot hope to satisfy the partisans of one party or the other in such controversy as the Mandate has aroused. Their purpose is to be just as between the two peoples in Palestine whose destinies in that country have been affected by the great events of recent years, and who, since they live side by side, must learn to practise mutual tolerance, goodwill and co-operation. In looking to the future, His Majesty's Govern ment are not blind to the fact that some events of the past make the task of creating these relations difficult; but they are encouraged by the knowledge that at many times and in many^ places in Palestine during recent years the Arab and Jewish inhabitants have lived in friendship together. Each community has much to contribute to the welfare of their common land, and each must earnestly desire peace in which to assist in increasing the well-being of the whole people of the country. The respo. sibility which falls on them, no less than upon His Majesty's Government, to co-operate together to ensure peace is all the more solemn because their country is revered by many millions of Moslems, Jews and Christians throughout the world who pray for peace in Palestine and for the happiness of her people.

You should inform the Government to which you are accredited that H.M.G. are studying urgently the position created by Assembly decision on partition of Palestine and that they will keep Arab Governments informed of such further developments as will affect their interests. ? Meanwhile H.M.G. feel certain that Arab Governments for their part will not wish to complicate the delicate process of withdrawal from Palestine and hand over to United Nations Commission which H.M.G. have now got to carry through and that they will therefore proceed with circumspection and do nothing precipitate during this transitional period. whatever may be feelings of Arab States with regard to United Nations decision H.M.G. are counting on assurances which have been given by various Arab spokesmen that there is no intention of causing dis trust in Palestine while we are still in control there and while we are bound to repress disorder from whatever quarter it arises. 2. It will not be enough for Arab States to refrain from sending units of their armies into Palestine. We must urge them also to redtrain any of their nationals who try to make their way into Palestine for purposes of causing disorder there as well as organisations and individuals in their territories who try to incite disorder from outside.

Sd/* V.B. Bay.From Foreign Office, London. His Majesty's Representatives «I? L - 0 To No.60 Intel Dated 1.10 p.m. 6th February, 1948 CONFIDENTIAL The refusal of‘His Majesty's Government to agree to the earlier arrival of the United Nations Commission in Palestine before May 1st has led to widespread accusations of obstruction and consequent loss of goodwill. 2. The fact is that His Majesty's Government have no intention of obstructing the Commission's work, and ere doing their best to fit the Commission's requiremette into their plans for withdrawal from Palestine. 3 . We are advised that the arrival of the Commission will almost certainly be the signal for a general flare-up of violence in Palestine. In this connexion it might be well to recall that the arrival of an International Commission in Mogadishu led to serious trouble. The situation in Palestine is infinitely more complicat ed and dangerous, and, whereas the Commission which visited Mogad ishu was merely on an exploratory mission, the Commission planning to go to Palestine will be arriving to enforce a decision which has been rejected not only by the majority of the inhabitants of the country itself but by every one of the neighbouring eentpels. countries. 4. It is however not necessary for the Commission itself to go to Palestine in order to begin its preparatory work there. The Palestine Government have offered to receive members of its Secretariat at any time, and this offer has been communicated to the Commission in New York by Sir A. Cadogan. It is surely better even from the Commission's point of view that its staff should be able to start work in a relatively calm atmosphere rather to arrive with the Commission itself and to find the country in chaos. 5. While this concession should be emphasised it should also be pointed out that His Majesty's Government have consistently and publicly stated, from the beginning, that Britain could not be a party to the imposition of any decision on Palestine which was not acceptable to both Jews and Arabs. It follows that the Commission cannot begin to enforce the partition plan while the mandatory povei is responsible for maintaining order 6 . We have, too, the responsibility to our own troops and police which we should not be ashamed to stress, in view of the extreme reluctance which has been so far shown by other members of the United Nations to volunteer to take their place.

CONFIDENTIAL Following is summary of our views on legal position in Palestine. 2 . United Nations Resolution of November 29th did not set up Jewish and Arab States. Various steps had first to be taken by United Nations Commission and Provisional Governments very few of which have been taken. Jewish claim to U.N. authority for their State is therefore invalid. 3 . Palestine is not a recognised international entity though at some considerably later stage one or more governments may emerge having characteristics necessary for international recognit ion. 4 . u.N, have no sovereign rights over Palestine since only way they can acquire such rights over a territory is by gapship. 5 . There is no repeat no force in the theory that authority over Palestine remains in what is left of principal Allied and associated Powers of 1914 War. 6 . Palestine is therefore a shrt of res nul llug. Its theoretical sovereignty lies in the peoples of Palestine but this is latent. 7. Consequently (a) all claims to set up a State in Palestine must be judged by ordinary standards of international law and usage. (b) invasion by Arab armies without coming into conflict with Jews is not necessarily illegal or contrary to United Nations Charter. If these armies cross frontier recommended for Jewish State in U.N. Assembly Resolution of November 29th they would not ipso facto be doing anything illegal though they would no doubt be laying themselves open to public criticism. If they come into conflict with the Jews the Security Council will no doubt be asked to consider situation as a breach of the peace - SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS oOo CONFIDENTIAL PERSIAN GULF REISDENCY BAHRAIN the 20th May, 1948 Copy forwarded with compliments to:- 1.
