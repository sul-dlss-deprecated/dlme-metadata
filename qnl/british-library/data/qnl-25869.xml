Mishan accuses Sufug. of siding with Rashid Ali last May and is encouraging the discontent of the Aulad Faisal at Sufuq’s failure to exact retribution from the Aqaidat for the death of Sufuq al Faisal in the raid which he led on the Aqaidat in Syria last July. Mishan further charges Sufuq ith responsibility for a Shammer raid on the Jubur in Syria which took place in October. The Shammar got away with 200 camels and killed 29 Juburis for a loss of 5 Shamuaris. Sufuq’s vert ion of the position is that he had to bribe the Iraq General Officer Com.landing at Mosul last May in order to secure the release of kishan who had been imprisoned, that he has restrained the Shammar from attacking the Aqaidat out of deference to the official desire for a peaceful settlement and that Mishan is responsible for causing trouble between the Shammar and the Yezidis. 3. Further raiding and counter-raiding is expected. The Jubur, probably with the support of Khurusa sections of the Shammur domiciled in Syria, are likely to seek revenge for the Shammar raid on them in October;Daham, /the RECd.

After congratulating Regent on restoring parliamentary life following suppression of '’destructive movement which did not spare even this house itself, whose members were forced to assemble illegally” reply reads ”in appreciating sacrifices made and efforts exerted^ by Your Highness for delivery of Iraq from predicament brought upon it by handful of individuals'*'moved by selfish ambitions and foreign intrigue this assembly feels fully confident that •justice will take its course in trial of organiser of that movement in order that national conscience shall be assured and in order also prevent recurrence similar cruel events” 9 Trust is then expressed that Government will execute programme outlined in speech from Throne in interest of people who are most anxious to continue immune from the calamities now scourging world and faithful to their pledges to their Allies as is required by both text and spirit of alliance. Following summarises Prime Minister’s speech as published in presso Modern history of Iraq falls into two stages, one preceding second following admission into League of Nations. First was abnormal and characterised by peculiar problems which no Iraqi could fail recall together with reasons made unavoidable in treaty which we never claimed as ideal but repeatedly declared it constituting step towards attainment country’s objectives, to be duly followed by further steps. At that time'’ treaty considered as protective fence. At that time we felt compelled to do without many necessary things in order to ensure one most essential object, namely national existence for Iraq, leaving other desideratum for future. Anyone who ventured constructive work had to face accusations such as must be faced at present. Anyone opposing such endeavours earned title of patriot. But / during that stage Iraq obtained more than other countries and many such countries envied Iraq. After Faisal died many Iraqi leaders became victims of wicked false propaganda bringing calamity on country.

Cairo for Minister of State Saving No.12. b b b b b b Recent sharp increase in local prices, especially of essential commodities such as wheat, is causing growing agitation. Anti-British propagandists attribute the rising cost of living largely to exploitation by Jews with our connivance. Experience has shown that price control, even on a limited scale, is most difficult to'enforce in this country. Rationing is generally accepted as being out of the question. It is highly desirable, therefore, to conserve adequate supplies as far as possible of those foodstuffs which are vital to the well being of the copulation. Satisfactory arrangements have already been made for imports of sugar, tea and coffee, prices of which have, in consequence, not risen unduly. ^ Of three other essential foodstuffs for Arabs, wheat Ghee and dates, local supplies of the two latter are adequate. As regards wheat,, the failure of the harvest coupled with hoarding and recent prohibition on export from India through individual merchants has forced up local prices. There is already considerable unrest in the North'where wheat is mainly grown and the shortage is most acute. The Prime Minister has impressed on me the Government's anxiety regarding wheat and has suggested that we should arrange for supplies to be sent urgently to Iraq before repercussions tend'to become uncontrollable. 'The Government fear seed wheat is being eaten, and are apprehensive regarding the next harvest. 2. Minister of Economics has asked United Kingdom Commercial Corporation to obtain 14,000 tons wheat from India. ~ No answer has been received yet to enquiry made by United Kingdom Commercial Corporation [grp. undec. ? locally] regarding supply prospects (see my telegram No.3 Encom). 3. I appreciate shipping and other transport difficulties but I consider essential that wheat should be supplied and announcement of impending arrival made as soon as' passible. I will endeavour to ensure tlxat- the-wheat is put to the best use.

He wants to start a new school on British public school lines with British masters (in a re-organised Faisal college). He was a little unsatisfactory about Hamley but I persuaded him to agree to the idea of appointing him as adviser. I am telegraphing separately about this. (7) He will re-organise and strengthen propaganda department. (8) He will close down French Legation and intends also to close Japanese Legation. (9) He is having three Shiahs in [sic: ? and] two Kurds in the Cabinet and says that he realises the importance of gaining goodwill of both by redressing their grievances. (10) He has promised to do nothing without our consent regarding Arab Confederation and Palestine and Syrian questions during the war. 11 (11) If he fulfils half of his assurances the millennium will have arrived but they show at all events that his heart is at present in the right place.With the ComjtJimQntQ of the Under 0 f State to ? » Vi/jLil*3 FILE COPY 1 0 OCT 1941 bM bUAt [This telegram is of particulafrnsgprecy and should he retained by the authorised renifriffrit nndf not passed on].

Though circumstances may necessitate his recall, it would be^better for him to remain away for the present. He would evidently like the Premiership but general opinion here is strongly opposed to the idea. 2. Ibrahim Kcmal is far the best candidate for the Premiership from our point of view. He has promised me that i he would reorganise education (with Hamley if available), clean up the army and proceed vigorously against Rashid Ali and followers and against fifth columnists. I believe that he would co-operate fully with us in other ways. He has, however ? a bad manner and is not personally popular. Regent is asking him to form Cabinet but it is still unknown whether he can do so. Factor which is militating against his chance of success is that Iraqi politicians, while ready when out of power to criticise everything and everyone, shrink from joining a man whom they know will follow a strong policy, 5.^ Except for Ibrahim Kcmal there is no-one capable of filling the office adequately and if he fails Regent will promptly have to fall back on tho present Minister for Fpreign Affairs or,ask the present Prime Minister to reform his Cabinet, In either case we could expect friendly co operation but there would be [ grp. undec, ? no] really serious attempt to reorganise administration of the army or to deal with fifth columnists.

I emphasised that as Jamil Madfai’s Government might not last beyond end of this month, the present moment afforded golden opportunity for the Regent to prepare ground carefully for its successor*_ All that was required of Jamil Madfai [2 gps. undec. ]/it |tf**«*K should start trial without further objection. I then went on to explain that the policy, just as much as the composition [1 gp.undec ] new Government needed careful thought. If new Government were to be strong and obtain popular support, its programme must be constructive and comprehensive. Repressive measures in themselves were not sufficient. I suggested that questions such as reduction in cost-of-living, scaling-down of the army, unemployment and education seemed to be some of the most important issues awaiting solution. Political programmes in this country were generally of such a vague nature that they amounted to little or nothing, and I hoped that the new Government would avoid that pitfall. If it showed courage, and the will to remedy ills', it would, in the long run, secure popular support. General improvement in Middle East, and presence of ever-increasing numbers of British troops should surely facilitate the task of any Government which was pledged to co-operate with Great Britain. 2. The Regent appeared to agree, and in reply to my further enquiries as to candidates which he had in view for a new Government, stated that he understood that Ibrahim Kemal might be prepared to form an administration, if he had the support of Ali Jaudat and Nuri Pasha. Ibrahim Kemal apparently desired reconciliation with the latter. I told Regent that whilst I personally would not be very happy to see Nuri Pasha returning again so soon ? I preferred to refrain from any expression of opinion, as I did not wish in any way to make Regent’s task more difficult. I suggested however that the Regent should firstly ascertain the definite views of Ibrahim Kemal and Ali Jaudat. The Regent said that he would ask me to come and see him when position had become a little 'clearer. My own view is that Ibrahim Kemal is about the only strong figure available to lead a new r Government.mi -e j 2 . • . In conclusion, I impressed on the Regent the • importance of his making himself more popular m the country* ■■ At present he v/as hardly ever seen. Yvny not travel in the country, meet people, distribute decorations and get publicity? It v/as in own interests and those of the Palace: the Regent replied that he had intended to visit the north this month, but had come to the conclusion that the moment was not yet rjpe . He intended however shortly to make a * ^_comp rehen si ve tour of Irag remaining three or four days inyYiwa. He had also decided to maKe closer contact with the army officers by inviting them to play polo. 4. The Regent seemed to appreciate the frankness of our conversation, and I only hope, therefore, that it may produce some effect. • 51 .^ J4^' With tha of th'^ f Sets retard P^l to F or'&amp;ig^ i Al'j&amp;M’jL .

August 1941. 4th August 1941, Repeated to Government of India, telegram No. 377, Bagdad telegram No, 870, Iraqi refugees are still in Tehran and undoubtedly in contact with Axis Legations. Mayr, who acted as intermediary between Germans in Berlin and Rashid Ali in Iraq, is still here pretending to be employed in transporto Italian named Roccardi, who was in Iraq during May acting most suspiciously, is now attached to Italian Legation, after posing as inspector of Italian merchant marine. Present Iraqi Government may well object to this protection of their enemies by Iranian (Persian) Government. Parallel representations by them would, I think, be a good thing. 2. For Iranian Air Force, see Tehran Military Attache’s Order of Battle for June 1941, of which War Oifice and General Officer Commanding Iraq have copies. Only modern aircraft, viz: 9 Tomahawks cannot be ready lor at least 2 months, Several pilots are first class a u good,^but machines, though serviceable, are obsolete. Navigation, bombing and aerial gunnery, are poor for lack oi practice, and very little night flying has been attempted. It is difficult to believe Iranian Air Force would be a serious menace to Iraq or to British Forces in Iraq, even if large, which is by no means certain. 3. I have always assumed that if we were compelled to occupy part of Iran (Persia) we should simultaneously issue declaration about respecting integrity of Iran and a promise to evacuate Iranian territory after the war.

Repeated representations have been made by the Iraqi Minister and myself about Iraqi refugees but with little effect. It is true that only one is now at an hotel, the others being in houses, but the boasted supervision does not prevent their going to restaurants for meals or from communicating with each other and at least indirectly with foreign missions. Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs admitted on July 30th, that if rebels against the Iranian (Persian) Government fled to Bagdad, the Iranian Government would expect the strictest control and again promised to prevent communication with foreign missions but I have little hopes that the police will be really strict with these people. Request for the removal of refugees to the provinces is still met with the contention that supervision is more certain in Tehran. ^ r ^ ^ s\ 15T -1 @y| UTWARD TELEGRAM [T^.is Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should be kept under Lock and Key.] /V&gt; (E [This telegram is of particular secrecy and should be retained by the authorised recipient and not passed on].

Cairo No. 2569 Government of India No. 8591 My telegram No. 321 [of June 25th: Arab refugees in Iran (Persia).] What is present position as regards those refugees who have not received visas for Turkey? It is most desirable for a variety of reasons that you and your Iraqi colleague should keep up constant pressure on Iranian Government over this and leave them in no doubt of extreme importance which our two Governments attach to having these persons removed from the vicinity of the capital and their activities strictly controlled.Your telegram No, 6 61. _ This question, more than any other, has been exercising my attention. 2. My appreciation of the present situation is as follows: • . (a) Outside Iraq, Principal supporters of Rashid Ali have fled the country. Most are in Iran (Persia), few in Turkey. The Government propose to try Rashid Ali and [grp. undec.]s in absentia and are preparing a case which they say will ?.ead to death sentences and confiscation of property* ' They have let it be known that his less important followers who wish to return to Iraq may do so unconditionally. A number has already come back. Some have been arrested and will be tried. Others will be treated leniently [grp. undec.: ?though] I [grp. undec.: ?doubt whether] this policy will secure their loyalty. The slowness in bringing the principals to trial keeps alive the belief that they will shortly return. TaufiqSuwaidl is not considered to be hostile and can return whenever he wishes. (b) In Iraq. (1) The worse anti-British elements are being eliminated from the Civil Service, All bad [two grps.. undec.: ?Arabic officials] have been removed, the staffs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and of all Legations and Consulates have been overhauled and many officials dismissed. Unfortunately-others who should have been dismissed have only been transferred to other posts. A very friendly Director-General of Police is ‘trying to reform his force and in other departments some ?fifteen highly placed headquarters' officials have been dis missed. ihe Army has been purged of many of its worst senior officers and reforms continue. Neither the Army nor the&gt;police as a whole is yet satisfactory. 1 (2) In [two grps. undec.] of all services the feeling in favour of Rashid Aii and against us, is still so prevalent that treatment by dismissal is impractidable. Means nave to be sought to bring about a change of heart in all but the most - obstinate. Tnis is necessarily a gradual [grp. omtd.: ?process] RECd POL. ~Pt. v) Uw -4 INDIA OFFICE (3) Hostile ...(3) Hostile elements amongst the uribes present a special problem. They are npt many, and I have been urging the Cjovernment to take suitable' action to render them innocuous. r x . (4) As regards the anti-British organisations, the National Guard of Heroes has been broken up and the'President, Vice-President and Secretarj/- arrested. The Legion of Youth has been raided and its organisers arrested. The Palestinian Defence Committee is moribund and public opinion has turned strongly against the Mufti and his clique.^ Many Palestinians and Syrians have left the country; the rest are' under suspicion. The jiuthanna Club. the Youth Moslem Association and Islamic Guidance ^ocieTy are all according to Minister for Foreign_Affairs [? being! purged of undesirable elements and reorganised under^supporters or the present administra- tion. &lt; The Rover Society and the Olympic Club has ceased all activity pending a decision concerning their future, (5) There have been in many quarters a genuine revulsion i|Of feeling against excesses of Rashid Ali and feeling on the whole is turning in our favour. The press and broadcasting =,j are excellent. (6) While there is more to their credit than is general ly conceded, the.main failure of the Government has been in not arresting dismissed officials other than hostile opponents. Fifth column organisation thus remains in being though without its most important leaders and constitutes the chief danger. The Government are preparing a concentration camp at Fao to which they say they will send their chief opponents shortly but they are very slow in taking action without your f? grp. omtd. ] 3. I have repeatedly impressed on the Ministers that the present lull is only temporary and that it is vitally important that they should make themselves secure in that ^delay. If Rashid and his chief supporters are condemned and concentration camp is opened, the situation should undergo a radical change._ My chief difficulty is that if I push them itoo hard they will resign and, incompetent though tney are,, they represent the only possible Government at the moment. It is for that reason that I am doing my utmost to strengthen our position throughout the country by means of our public_ relations section and political advisers. I myself'spend' several hours daily talking to Iraqis. I am also doing my best^to strengthen the Regent. He is amicable but un inspiring to the Iraqis and the Queen-has little political sense. # 4. ^ If this lull continues, I am not unhopeful that this policy^will_succeed. I think that the Government are doing their inefficient best and that they are friendly to us. Ultimately, however, the military situation will prove to be the decisive factor and if the Germans advance I could not rely on the Cabinet nor on the army and police. The feeling i that the Germans will v/in the war is deeply rooted in this ' jeountry and there is no genuine national sentiment to rally ; the country against them. Iraqis, like other orientals, always favour what they think is the winning side and the most that we could expect would be neutralitv. This would come more readily from^the tribes than from the armed forces and the towns. The situation has dangerous possibilities but, of course, the longer our respite the more firmly we“ought to be able to consolidate our position.OUTWARD TELEGRAM [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should be Nov/ that things are beginning to settle down in Iraq, I should be grateful for your views on the Question how best to deal with supporters of Rashid Ali regime. 2, Present position, as I understand it, is that there are some persons now outside Iraq who might safely be allowed to^ return, or even compelled to do so through financial and other pressure, e.g. Suwaidi brothers, General Amin Zaki and possibly even Sherif Sharaf. On the other hand, the Iraqi Government have by no means yet eliminated all extreme anti- British elements from key Government posts, while hostile elements in the country as a whole are left in complete liberty. Nor have Iraqi Government yet ventured to dissolve Palestine Defence Committee and other anti-British organisations, 3. &gt; The two extremes of general amnesty and absence of any discrimination on the one hand and drastic repression on the ■other seem both for the time being ruled out. The practical question is therefore to find compromise solution most likely to rally as much moderate support for the Regent as possible and to deter hostile elements from active intrigue. A. It will no doubt be well to feel our way cautiously, and the difficulties in the way of any action we wish to take should become less the more firmly our position in the Middle East is established and the more we are able to meet wishes of present Iraqi Government on economic questions and Arab policy generally, ^Iraqi Government are not,' however, likely to show much initiative in the matter and we ought not to allow any ( opportunities to slip.

I, naturally, have ignored their petition. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has not yet replied to my letter, so I do not know whether the other two chief criminals, one of which [sic] is Salim Naam A1 Attar who was sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment, have been arrested; I will remind him at the first opportunity of the attitude of His Majesty's Government. Political influences are at work in the case of the two_students and it must be anticipated that, even if this Cabinet drops the question of their release for the moment in view of our obvious disapproval, fresh attempts to revive it will be made in the future.

Provided that he considers.there will be no serious repercussions elsewhere, I would not feel justified in advising the Government to refrain from their obvious duty to maintain good order in the country, more particularly as I have been urging them to deal with Abdul Wahid and others who are a danger to our lines of communication on the Euphrates. 2.
