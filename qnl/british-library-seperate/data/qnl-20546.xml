Kemball encloses with his letter translated extracts of an intelligence report (folios 357-59) received by him from the British Agent at Sharjah, Hajee Yacoob, dated 16 July 1853. In his report, Yacoob reports of the further importation of slaves into Rusul Khymah [Ra's al-Khaymah], and that Sheikh Sultan ben Suggar [Sultan bin Saqr] of Ra's al-Khaymah has this season demanded a levy of five dollar per head on any slaves imported into his territories. Yacoob also reports on the re-enslavement and sale of a previously manumitted man at Ejmaun [Ajman], correspondence between Sultan bin Saqr and the Wahhabi chief Ameer Fysul, and Sheikh Saeed ben Tahnoon's [Sa'id bin Tahnun] orders to his people to proceed from Aboothabee [Abu Dhabi] to Doah [Doha], and the subsequent dissent amongst some of the Sheikh's subjects upon their arrival of Doha.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051555.0x00005f#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
