P. Charteris A. Stewart enquiring for infomation regarding certain oil s/eepages mentioned in angler b Petroleura' as existing in the neighbourhood of Bemaid-el-Or (near Kuwait) and the Islands of Garu Tarsi and Haim. Mr. Stewart is believed to be in the employ of Lord Cowdray and presumably connected with 'Pearsons'. He has clready applied in similar letters to the one now unoer reference to the Political Agent, Bahrain, and to •■is Britannic Majesty's Consul at Basrah, who have in each case referred him to me. Your telegram, Sir, No.299, dated 7th July 1914 , to His Excellency Sir Louis Mallet has reached me in blue print and would seem to imply that His Majesty's Sir Edward Grey, Bart., K.G., K.P. &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. GovernmentGovernment are not averse to introducing the Turkish Petroleum Company into Nejd and Basrah, As regards the actual places in respect of which Mr. Stewart desires information, Bemaid-el-Gr should read Banald-ul-Qar which, with Qaru, is included in the territory of the Shaikh of Kuwait. 'Tarsi H should probably read ,1 Parsi H and is probably an appanage of £1 Ahsa, in which case negotiations should be undertaken with Bin Baud, recently appointed as Turkish Wall of Nejd Halul is indeterminate but the island itself is well known and a beacon has lately been erected there by His Majesty’s Government in connexion with the Lighting and Buoying Scheme in the Persian Gulf. It probably belongs to the Shaikh of Abu Dthabi. As regards indications of oil, the names Banald-ul Qar and )aru certainly suggest pitch or bitumen and the Persian Gulf Gazetteer at page 617, Volume II, speaks of an intermittent spring of bitumen existing under the sea in the neighbourhood of Halul. I have no special inform ation in regard to Farsi and have not been able to find anythinganything in my records* Such information as we have in this office of these indications is very meagre and generally confined to fisherman’s talk of pitch floating in the open sea. I fear therefore that it would be of little use to Mr. Stewart. A copy of this despatch is being forwarded to the Government of India for information. I have, &amp;c., (Signed) S. G.

Sir Edward Grey to Sir L. Mallet {Constantinople). (No. 299.) ^ Foreign Office, July 7, 1914, 4 p.m. 1 OUR telegram No. 410 of 6th July : Oil concessions in Nejd. We had fully considered question of introducing Turkish Petroleum Company into Nejd and Basra ; as 50 per cent, of capital and chairman will be British, its constitution is less open to objection than any other oil company apart from Anglo-Persian, which, for political reasons, it is inexpedient to introduce into Turkey. Pearsons are not acting for themselves alone, but for an international syndicate. Moreover, settlement reached with Germany lessens danger of German consular intrigues in Nejd or El Hasa, while I can think of no arrangement that would eliminate it altogether. Company have, I understand, already addressed certain applications to Yali of Basra in respect of areas both in Basra and Nejd, but most satisfactory course in regard to those provinces would still be for company’s agents in Constantinople to make direct agreement with Silley at early date. As to Bin Sand, I am consulting India Office ; but I should be glad to know when his appointment as Vali is likely to be publicly announced, and, I think, in view of agreement reached with him by Ottoman Government, that there is no longer any adequate reason for deferring settlement as to our own interests in Nejd and El Hasa, to which India Office attach much importance. Hakki Pasha has asked for authority to discuss question, and he is fully cognisant of our wishes. It would be satisfactory to all concerned if this question, which should not entail lengthy negotiation, could be frankly discussed at once.In any further communication on the subject, please quote n„. 7951/14. and address— The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, London.

S. 8ures * “ Lawrence ” reporting the circumstances attending an explosion which occurred while the outer bar gas buoy was being recharged on 14th instant. 2 I venture to hope that the presence of mind and pluck of the Stoker Tindal, Shaikh Mohidin, but for which there would in all probability have been loss of life, will be accorded specific recognition at the hands of higher authority. I am forwarding a copy of this letter and enclosures to the Government of India in the Foreign Department.26 Sub-Enclosure No - 211 &gt; dated Fao ’ tlie 14th A P ril 1913 * 1 of Serial From— Lieutenant G. H. Finnis, R. I. M., Commanding R.I.M.S. “ Lawrence”, No 57 To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I regret to report that this morning at about 8-10 a.m. whilst charging the outer bar light buoy, an explosion occurred by which 1st class Stoker Shaikh Muhammad was seriously burnt. Lieutenant Lane, Assistant Engineer Beggs and Gunner Williams who were at the ship’s side, placing the carbide into the canvas chute were knocked down and thrown amidships by the force of the explosion. On hearing the explosion, I went on deck and took charge. Seeing that flames to the height of 10 feet were coming out of the buoy, I had the buoy dropped astern and sand thrown on to smother the flames. We allowed it to burn out, a minor explosion took place when just astern, so I would not allow anyone to approach it till after 10 a.m. for safety. On examination we found that the carbide inside the generator was perfectly untouched, 14| cases were packed before the explosion took place. On seeing this I would not allow the other 6 carbide capes to be packed in, as it is nearly certain, the explosion was caused by the crude oil supplied to us by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company for soaking the carbide in, before charging. The explosion I am of opinion was caused by a small quantity of gas generated in the chute and this was ignited by a spark caused by the falling carbide. I beg to point out that in the book of instructions on the management of gas buoys in the Persian Gulf, 1912, paragraph 35, page 10, it is distmctly laid down that buoys are not to be recharged whilst in the water. Gas must have generated in the buoy, though in a very small quantity, other wise the explosion could not have taken place. I saw the oil used for treating the carbide tested at the Abadan Laboratory and it flashed at 175° which is considered perfectly safe. I tried the buoy and found it as far as I can judge to be in working order, only damage being done 8 wooden slots and the canvas chute burnt. I have fitted new slots and the canvas chute can be made on board. I consider that we have been exceptionally fortunate in the fact that the above officers were not seriously injured or killed. Copies of the evidence of Board of Enquiry on the accident are forwarded. Bated Fao, the 14th April 1913. From— Lieutenant P. C. Lane, R. I. M. To—The Officer Commanding R.I.M.S. “ Lawrence.” I have the honour to report that this morning, having been working on the gas buoy since 5-30 a.m. and all being ready for charging same at 7-30 a.m., I was helping Second Engineer Beggs at this work, when buoy was nearly charged, an explosion occurred which came straight up the chute knocking myself and Mr. Beggs the other side of the deck, the man on the buoy was knocked down and badly burnt, would probably have been burnt to death but for the pluck and presence of mind of Tindal of Stokers 2nd Class, Sheikh Mohidin, who jumped on to the buoy and dragged the man out of the cage, put him in the water and held him till a boat came. Previous to this, I had given orders that no smoking was to be done or matches used near forecastle head, fore flat or crews’ quarters till gas buoy had been dropped astern. The officer of the day went rounds a few minutes before the explosion occurred and all ports were shut, on starboard side forward. My opinion on the explosion is, we had been given oil of a low flashing point and not the same as last time. This oil is being tested. Every precaution was taken during the filling of this buoy.

I was on the forecastle head and saw Lieutenant Lane, Assistant Engineer Beggs and Gunner Williams with two or three stokers and lascars engaged in charging the gas buoy, one man was inside the cage on the buoy. I heard the 1st Lieutenant give orders, that there was to be no smoking in the foreflat, crews’ quarters, or in the foc’sle head, until after the buoy had been passed astern, and that all ports on the starboard side were to be closed down. After reporting 8 a.m. I went round the foreflat and saw that the ports were closed, also no smoking was taking place. I then went aft on to the bridge, as I reached the top of the ladder. I heard an explosion and looking forward saw smoke rising from the buoy, so I immediately ran down and reported to yourself that an explosion had taken place in the buoy. Fire stations were then piped, so I took up my station aft. Dated Fao, the 16th April 1913. Sub-Enclosure From— Assistant Engineer, J. Beggs, R. I. M., 4 of Serial To—The Officer Commanding R.I.M.S. “ Lawrence.” __ N 0, I have the honour to report that work of recharging the outer bar buoy was started on Friday, 11th instant p.m. On Saturday morning the generator chamber was opened in order to remove the residue of the old charge of calciufti carbide and to prepare the chamber for a new charge. After working on this buoy for five or six hours it was decided owing to a strong breeze springing up to disconnect the buoy from its moorings and take it in tow to Fao, where the work could be carried out with more safety. During the towing the generator chamber and main sea valve were open. On Sunday morning, work was again started to remove the residue from the chamber and was done in the usual manner and according to instructions from book, this was all removed and the chamber was thoroughly cleaned and dried before work was knocked off at about 5 p.m. The buoy was brought alongside the ship at 5-30 a.m. on Monday and the chamber was examined and found to be thoroughly dry, it was then prepared in the usual manner for receiving the charge of calcium carbide i.e. by means of a mop ; the sides of the generator were covered with a coating of crude petroleum. The carbide tins were opened and crude petroleum was poured in and the tins rolled to ensure that all carbide came in contact with the oil, as by soaking the carbide in oil the danger from explosion is minimised. The canvas chute used for recharging was then placed in the chamber allow ing about 4 feet to rest on the bottom, to form a cushion for the falling carbide As the chamber filled, the chute was shortened still allowing the same length to rest on the carbide. The man was placed on the buoy to tend the chute and guide the carbide into its place. I was present during the whole of the charging operation and can certify that all the carbide placed in the chamber was well covered with oil. Fourteen and a half drums weighing a cwt. each were expended in charging the buoy and each piece was dropped in separately, it was at this stage at about 8-15 a.m. when the explosion occurred ; the operation having been in progress about Ij hours, the flames shot up to a height of about 4 to 5 feet enveloping the canvas chute. The injured man was removed and the buoy was passed astern and flames allowed to die out. At 10 a.m. when the buoy was examined the carbide in the generator chamber was in the same condition as it was previous to the explosion i.e. the oil adhering to the carbide and walls of the chamber was untouched and quite fresh, showing that there had been no fire inside the chamber and therefore clear ly proving that the explosion must have taken place in the canvas chute. 27 C112FD1 28 k ■ A light or spark will not ignite calcium carbide if it is dry, but when it be comes damp it generates acetyline gas, which will of course ignite if brought into contact with a light or spark. The carbide appeared to be very dry, and if the explosion occurred through dampness it must either have been the fault of the carbide being wet or undetectable or the oil that was used for mixing witli the carbide had a bad percentage of water mixed with it, as the atmosphere was dry and no water to the best of my knowledge came in contact with the carbide whilst charging. A spark may have originated through one of the pieces of carbide striking some of the iron work round the buoy or that which is used for supporting the lantern. I received the oil from the Assistant Manager, Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Abadan, who informed me that the quality was the same as that previously supplied for charging the Bushire buoys which was said to have a flash of 150 but should oil of a lower flash point have been supplied, this would render an explosion possible and so may account for the accident. This is the fourth buoy that I personally charged and the work was carried out in exactly the same manner as in the other three and every precaution against carelessness and naked lights was observed. Sub-Enclosure 5 of Serial No. 57. Dated Fao, the 14th April 1913. From—Gunner D. G. L. Williams, To— Lieutenant-Commander G. H. Finnis, Commanding R.I.M.S. “ Lawrence.” I have the honour to report that this morning, on turning to at 5-30 a.m. work was commenced on the gas buoy. After hauling buoy up to starboard side foc'sle head under derrick, it was canted on on its side. Second Engineer Beggs made an inspection of lower end, after which the buoy was lowered. He then gave necessary orders for cleaning and preparing the carbide chamber for recharging. At 7 a.m. the operation of recharging was commenced by the Second Engineer Beggs. The First Lieutenant and myself were assisting. Previous to recharging being started, the 1st Lieutenant gave orders to have all square ports starboard side forward, lowered, and all round ports in crews’ quarters starboard side closed, giving at the same time verbal orders to the 0. 0. Watch to see them closed. Smoking was prohibited forward astern. until such time as buoy was dropped A At 8-10 a.m. an explosion occurred, one stoker who was on the buoy inside the cage being severely burnt. The canvas chute (for filling and the wooden bars of cage caught fire, the waste oil on buoy also ignited). I saw the first Lieutenant being thrown across the deck, Second Engineer Beggs dropped to the deck with the force of explosion. I myself felt the shock very severely. Orders were given to drop the buoy astern and for the hands to go to fire quarters in both of which evolutions I was at my station. To the best of my knowledge the cause of the explosion emanated from the buoy itself and was not due to sparks from ship’s funnel, matches or through any carelessness. I saw nobody smoking in the vicinity. The recharging was being carried out in my opinion in as safe a manner as circumstances would allow. Each piece of carbide being placed in the canvas chute provided for filling by hand. Further, I beg to state that during my commission in this vessel, I have been present on each occasion that this buoy has been recharged and every precaution has been always taken to ensure safety as was done to-day. T’US€- Dated Fao, the 14th April 1913. From— Assistant Surgeon F. H. Asquith, I.S.M.D., To—The Officer Commanding, R.I.M.S. “ Lawrence.” I have the honour to submit the following report being the results of my examination of 1st class stoker Shaikh Muhammad. Patient was admitted to hospital this morning, suffering from extensive burns of the anterior surfaces of the head and neck, upper part of abdomen, lower extremities and the fronts and backs of the upper extremities. The burns vary from those of the 1st to those of the 3rd degree. The shock sustained must have been severe as when brought in, patient was quite pale and shivering with a weak pulse and cold extremities. Although the burns are extensive and involve such a large area, the prog nosis seems favourable, owing to patient’s excellent physique. Sub-Enclosure 6 of Serial No. 57. s No. 119-1462-X.B.

Considered exclusively from the navigational standpoint a beacon on Halul Island would, however, appear unnecessary.

Khor Kaliyah Beacon.—h cairn was erected in 1905 by H.M.S. “ Redbreast ” as a mark for navigators entering the Khor Kaliyah. The Government of India subsequently approved its conversion into a permanent beacon at an estimated cost of Rs. 500 {vide Foreign Department letter No. 2064-E.B., dated 31st 31st May 1905). I have ascertained that the work was never carried out, as no mason could be found to do the work. I have asked Major Trevor to arrange for its erection during the course of the constructions of buildings, etc., for the radio telegraphic installation now projected. Kuwait. Ras-al-Arz Beacon. —The present beacon is pyramidical in shape about 30 feet high, surmounted by a black ball ; it is visible about 8 miles distant; it was erected by the Government of India in 1905 with the approval of the Shaikh of Kuwait at a cost of Rs. 280 {vide Foreign Department letter No. 1681-F.B., dated 4th May 1905 to Resident), and has since been maintained by the same authority. Kubbar Island. —This is a point which steamers generally try to make when bound for Kuwait, and it is considered that a beacon on it would be of great practical value to navigators. It is recommended that the Shaikh of Kuwait be asked to consent to the erection of a beacon thereon of the same size and type as that on Ras-al-Arz. The lighting Committee originally suggested a light house on Kubbar and there is plainly a real need for a mark of some sort. Captain Shakespear, who visited the Island recently, reported that a big beacon of plain dry rubble masonry could be built comparatively easily by local labour under arrangements made by him, there being plenty of good stone available. Bushire. Ras-al-Marg Beacon. —The Ras-al-Marg beacon in the inner harbour was washed away at the beginning of the present year ; it has since been replaced by a new structure which was constructed in the workshops of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company at Abadan and placed in position by R I M.S. “ Lawrence ” on 6th January 1913 (a zate telegram No. 20t&gt;, dated 1st February 1913 from the Resident to Foreign). Its navigational specifications are described in the tele gram quoted above, and it should be scheduled along with those already men tioned, as one of those for the maintenance and upkeep of which His Majesty’s Government are responsible. Jashk Beacon. —This beacon also should, I think, be scheduled as one of those the maintenance of w r hich is undertaken by His Majesty’s Government. The following is a description of it taken from page 143, Persian Gulf Pilot:— “ Clearing Marks. A beacon consisting of three posts with a large square board, painted black with a white disc; stands on the shore as a guide to the anchorage. ” Jashk Stone Beacon. —This beacon is no doubt primarily intended to indi cate the position of the cable, but it is convenient that it should likewise be scheduled as one of the beacons to be kept and maintained by His Majesty’s Government as part of the general scheme. It is some 30 feet high, and painted in black and white bands. Henjam Beacon. — Vide page 155, Persian Gulf Pilot. As above. Bassidu Beacon. —This is described in the “ Persian Gulf Pilot” as a beacon consisting of a mast surmounted by a cask ; the v^hole about 40 feet high and visible from 5 to 6 miles.

The locality is suitable and the space ample for our requirements. I am not in favour with the present plans of using the Anglo Persian Oil Company 1 s jetty and crane for lifting in and out buoys when required. The jetty is about half a mile away from the lighthouse depot’s ground, and whenever buoys are shifted between the two places, the A. P. Oil Compary’s railway and locomotives vail have to be used as well as their crane, and special cradles made to place in the trucks on which to rest the buoys for transport. 3. There is a mud slipway just in front of the two acres space proposed for the lighthouse depot which the Managing Agent is agreeable to leasing with the two acres. The prospective value in the future of the foreshore, he says need not be taken into consideration as there is no reason to suppose that the A. P® Oil Company will want that part of the Island for mary years to cane* 4* ]y&amp;r proposal is that the shed for buoys and cable should be built opposite the slipway, so that the buoys can be landed on the slipway and hauled straight into the shed, a veiy simple undertaking as the river bank is steep too; the buoys can be towed on to the slipway at ary period between half and high tide and rolled up the slight incline or landed on a cradle and drawn up; the depot would then be quite self-contained, a matter of considerable advantage when the output of oil by the A* P* Oil Compary is fully developed and their wharfage continually in use. 5* The slipway would have to be faced with bricks and I have askedN sdkeo- the I^anagep to estimate for this as well as for the dwelling quarters, carbide and oil and cable sheds. b ' The 0ffiGe r Cormianding R. I. M. S. 'Lawrence*' being unfor tunate^ in bed with malaria, I was accompanied in my inspection ' oy '' r ' e first lieutenant and Engineer who fully concur with me in the above recomr,endstion. The first Lieutenant also informs me that the Present arrangement of working on the A. p. oil Company* s jetty has not proved altogether satisfactory owing to unavoidable delay in obtaining the use of the crane and railway and a certain amount of interference with the material and the buoys while they are left on the A. P. Oil Company’s ground. TMs would tend to increase as the A. P. works develop and their business increases; and the result would I feel sure be a continual cause of friction between the two parties, which for obvious reasons it is desirable to avoid. o. The estimates are now being proceeded with and vail be submitted as soon as possible; Mr. Homer making out the designs J ' or t:ia buildings, while the A. F.

Before addressing you again on the subject I had intended to speak to Dmitrieff about it but the Constant incident intervened, closely followed by Dnitrieff T s suicide. As charge has now been taken over by a. new incumbent, it seems to be an opportune moment for the Russian Minister to reiterate his orders. Reference is invited to the concluding sentence of the despatch No. 63 dated 15th February 1913 from the Foreign Office to the Smbasqy at St. Petersburg. The Russian Consul-General mqy allege that the light is required to light the compound, hut in that case I would point out that the pretext is only a colourable one. All that is necessary for this is a lamp post on the ground, if anything further is required for this purpose; masthead lights which mislead ships are unnecessary and unwarranted, in addition to this vse have noted that these lamps like their predecessors become extinguished in a high wind.Telegram F* Fran Resident, To dvlinister. No* 173/596 * Dated March 1913. The following is of a secret nature. With reference to rry telegram No. 163/564 dated March 23rd. I have just seen some cormnnications which were sent to 3t. Petersburg at the end of February by the late M. Dnitrieff. In addition to being inventively mendacious, they are of a decidedly anglo-phobe nature. The subject of all three, either wholly or partly, is his masthead lights and he invents all sorts of excuses for their retention* In outward demeanour he was always most friendly and he did not give any outward expression to the sentiments breathed in his telegrams, so one would think he mist have been a little wrong in his head. The above is reported as it indicates that film pressure may have to be exerted in the matter of the lights. I venture to suggest again that a favourable time to press for their withdrawal seems to be afforded by the presence of a new and apparently temporary incumbent*Telegram P. Fran-Ivlinister 0 To-Resident o No. 133. Dated and received 29th March 1913. With reference to your telegram No* 173. I have already been told about Dmitrieff 1 s telegrams to St* Petersburg on the subject of the masthead lights by the Russian Charge d*Affaires. He says that it ms chiefly owing to the consistently and violently angle-phobe tone of the telegrams sent latterly by the Acting Consul General that he hesitated to approach me on the subject of the letter’s threatened suicide until the last moment. The matter is now out of the hands of the Legation as it ms referred to St. Petersburg by Lmitrieff. I am urging the Secretary for Foreign Affairs that representations to the Russian Government may be favourably renewed at the present moment*</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100046590666.0x000003_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/10/441/3</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100046590666.0x000003</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/10/441/3</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>File 50/1914 Pt 7 'Persian Gulf: lighting and buoying; erection of beacons on Henjam and other islands'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1913/1917</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-03-30T16:22:16</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 item (88 folios)</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>This item contains papers relating to the establishment and maintenance of lighting and buoying facilities in the Persian Gulf as part of British efforts to create a maritime navigation infrastructure in the Gulf.
