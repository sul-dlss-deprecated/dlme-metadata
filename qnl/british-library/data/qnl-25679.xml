I have already discussed the matter with you verbally after my arrival at Karachi. I am in favour of such investigations being carried out, because if mines are discovered in that part of my country, we would he much benefitted. But I am of opinion that circumstances do not permit that such investigations be carried out at the present moment. God willing, I will let you know whenever I see that the time is suitable for carrying out such a scheme.

Yours sincerely, M.J. CLAUSON,ESQ. ,frognal,N.W.3* 26th April,1932. To H.M.Secretary of State for the Colonies. Sir, In view of the discoveries by Mr.H.St.John Philby and Mr.Bertram Thomas the value of Dhufar and Ubar in Southern Arabia become not only of historical importance but with the possibility that the gold mines of Ophir were in the Quara mountains. On enquiry at the India Office regarding a map of the district I was informed that one was in course of preparation. May I point out that if this map includes Dhufar and Ubar as under British Protection it will be a definite proof against any claims that may arise in the future. I have made enquiries at the High Commissioner for India's Office, The India Office and the Crown Agents for the Colonies. | There does not appear to be any record in either I 0 f these departments as to the boundary of the British sphere of influence extending from Aden eastwards. 'The Times' ma.p however, gives a rought indication of the boundary. The Kuria Kuria Islands (Ihitakers Almanack) is in British Possession and lies a few miles from the South of the Arabian coast the particular district which is the object of this letter. An.3 A question I wish to ask is in the event of agree- aents being made with the local sheikhs at Ihufar and Ubar will it be necessary for these to be confirmed by either the India Office or the Crown Agents for the Colonies. Your obedient servant, (Sgd) F.B.LACY.I am dir^ct«4 by Secretary bir Cunliffa-^ister to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 2Sth of April regarding the possible presence of mineral deposits in Sotjthern Arabia in tha nei^bourhood of Dhufar and tJb&amp;r* 2. In reply I am to inform you that the &lt;\ question raised in the lest parag^nrh of your letter is not one which concerns the Crown Agents for the Colonies. The queetion ic one for the consideration of the India Office; a copy of your letter is therefore being eent to that Department from which you will receive a ce? mjniea- tion in due course.
