General Robinson wanted my views about their replacement* I told him I could not give my final views without consulting the Political Agent Bahrain but my preliminary views were as followsi (a) Batirain * About 50 men are required and their main duty is to prevent pilfering and the export of liquor from the camp at Muharraq* I suggested that as the State were themselves closely interested in these matters the best solution would be for the R.A^i** to pay for sufficient additional police to enable the duties mentioned above to be affectively carried out. General Robinson agreed with this view though vHng Commander Williams doubted if the Bahrain police could be trusted* I said that I hoped they would prove at any rate more trustworthy than the Bahzain levies who had been enlisted for the same purpose when I was in the Gulf before in 1941-42* I understood from conversations I had later that the main difficulty in imp lamenting my proposal lies in the fact that the Bahrain police are already under strength and find it very difficult to obtain recruits as their rates of pay compare unfavourably with those at Awall etc* (b) Sharjah* I gave it as my opinion that any locally enlisted levies would be completely untrustworthy. General Robinson suggested the payment of a subsidy to the Shaikh on the condition that he would provide guards and accept responsib ility* I said that I thought that the R«a*F « would be wall advised to continue to employ Assyrians. I understand that it would be possible to arrange this by discharging the men from their present formation and then re-enlisting them again in a. 2 - special locally formed unit. This expedient may also have to be resorted to in Bahrain if it is decided that the police cannot take over the responaihility. *sf * *• ltd. ...

It is not permissible in peace tiae to employ 'Iraqi forces outside ^raq and the Assyrian Levies at !5uharraq must therefore be withdrawn. It has been suggested that they should be replaced by ciembers of the Bahrain police and the a.A,7 should pay for the additional police required.

The State police are now slightly under strength, scarcely any suitable recruits are available at present and within the next two months a large number of men complete their service and it is probable that many of them may not wish to re-enlist for another two years. 3. At present we are having difficulty not only in recruiting Police but in obtaining Naturs, partly owing to the successful diving season which attracts men to return to the sea. Captain j. If.

Should, however, the R.A.F. be unable to provide Assyrians, I consider that the next best thing would be for them to employ guards nominated by the Shaikh, but paid direct by the R.A.F. in the same way as BAPCO watchmen are employed by that Company in Bahrain. I would emphasize, however, that if outside manpower can be made available I am definitely opposed to the recruitment of local men for guard duties in Sharjah.

I forward herewith a copy of memorandum No .ASLO/ 6 /AIH dated the 5th December, 1946, from the Air .jtaff Liaison Officer, Bahrain. The Bahrain Government have already informed me that they are finding it difficult ( i to secure a sufficient number of recruits for their own police force, and would be unable to supply the 50 men required by uhe R .A »F, for I^uharraq, vide paragraph 3 of my Express Letter No.C/1057 dated the 22nd September, 1^46. The situation may appear to have improved temporarily with the return of the pearling fleet to Bahrain, but/ most of these men would never pass an eye test. I am, however, opposed to the creation in Bahrain of a force of armed trained by British N.C.O.s and armed with Service weapons as this would inevitably react adversely on the Police Force already difficult enough to maintain. They would, in fact, be a rival force of armed police thinly disguised by the use of the word natur. 3. Local levies have proved unreliable in the past and Bahrain's name for the theft of ammunition is the worst in my Agency. I have no reason to believe that the na turs will be any better than their predecessors, and am opposed to the scheme on that ground also. 4. Further I am opposed to placing the security of His Majesty*f Government's property in the hands of unreliable native watchmen since, in the event of thefts taking place, there is no redress other than taking the Ruler to task and thus causing undesirable friction with the State. 5.

At Salalah the protection of Royal Air Force property is entrusted to locally recruited guards provided by the Sultan and paid for by the Royal Air Force.

These thefts have been attributed in almost every case to the subjects of the Sheikh of Sharjah and reflect on the integrity of the guards supplied by him to guard Air Ministry installations. It is requested, therefore, that the Sheikh of Sharjah may be approached and informed that should further thefts of this nature occur consideration wijl be given to the possibility of making him financially responsible for the replacement of such irstallations, the cost of which will be deducted from the monies pay able to him for the services of his guards.

Indeed, it has become increasingly clear that the Shaikh's own driver under cover of the Shaikh's car has been the means of getting stolen spare parts out of the Camp, and that the Shaikh's brothers Humaid and Rashid are regular and unchecked receivers of stolen property. /k Political Officer, Trucial Coast, Sharjah.

Your paragraph 2; The Officer Commanding the R.A.F. reports that the earliest payment mentioned in the current records of the unit here was made on the 8th June, 1944; and the last on the 22nd January, 1948. It is possible that eaiclier payments were made but the R.A.5 1 . here have no record of them. 3. Your paragraph 3* I have carefully gone into this case and it appear s^&gt;r^t the 37 guards authorized under the Civil Air Agreement of 1932 were used to guard the airfield, the buildings, and installations of Imperial Airways. They are still provided to guard B.O.A.C's Rest House.

I have nothing on record here to show the number of guards decided upon; nor have the Shaikh or the R.A.P. But I understand from enquiries I have made that first 20 were supplied and that the number was later raised^at the verbal request of the Officer Commanding, R.A.F.j^ by s tages) to 38. The Command Auditor, who is here now, confirms that during the war when Sharjah was a regular K.A.P. Station the Officer Commanding was authorized to settle such matters on his own initiative without reference to Air Headquarters. The J 38 guards to which you refer in paragraph 3 of your express letter ]\ r o. 141 are these guards. They have always been paid by the R.A.P. and they are quite separate from the 37 guards paid for through this office under the terms of the 1932 Air Agreement.—_ » 4. The misunderstanding about the guards has arisen because the Officer Commanding of the _&lt;.A.F, here, who has a copy of the Air Agreement of 1932, took it upon himself — without fully understanding the position and v/ithout ^consulting this office — to inform Air Headquarters that the R.A.F. here are paying the guards that are already being paid for through this office. 5. As far as I can ascertain the Shaikh has ear marked 46 men to provide a nightly guard of 38 men at the R.A.P. Camp and 18 men to provide a standing guard of 2 men at the B.O.A.C. ReHouse. It appears to me that the pay of 37 guards agreed to in 1932 was in the nature of a payment for police protection. B.O.A.C. here are not so much concerned that the full 37 should constantly be employed as that security should be good. Indeed, the physical presence of so many guards would be an embarrassment to B.O.A.C. The Officer Comm? nding, rl.A.P., however, insist^on the physical presence at night of all the 38 guards employed by the R.A.J? /k • « Political Officer, Trucial Coast, Sharjah.No. c/ 366 POLITICAL AGENCY BAHRAIN.

Topics covered in the file include: discussions over the level of security to be maintained at both Bahrain and Sharjah; the relative merits of maintaining ‘Assyrian’ (Iraqi) guards compared to locally recruited guards or guards from Baluchistan; problems recruiting guards in Bahrain, due to a shortage of suitable manpower; instances of the theft of cabling equipment at Sharjah, allegedly by the Shaikh of Sharjah’s own men, and correspondence with the Sultan bin Saqr, the Shaikh of Sharjah, warning that the cost of future thefts would be deducted from his guards’ pay.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Levy Corps</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sharjah Levy Corps</namePart></name></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000095#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
