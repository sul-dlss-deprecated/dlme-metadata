To His Majesty 1 s Secretary of State for India, India Office, LONDON. Copy to The Political Agent, KUWAIT. MEMORANDUM No King ! s Regulation has been made under the Kuwait Order-in-Council, 1935, similar to King’s Regulation No. 2 of 1937 (The Bahrain Passport Regulation, 1937), providing for the punishment, deportation or forcible repatriation of those persons who enter Bahrain without a valid visa. The necessity for such legislation in Kuwait was emphasised in April of this year when an appreciable number of Indian pilgrims arrived there without visas on their passports. Their intention was to perform the Pilgrimage but they did not possess sufficient funds even for their maintenance, and it was feared that some of them might attempt the journey on foot against the categorical prohibition of the Saudi Government. In order that legal provision may be made for dealing with such and other cases in future, I recommend that a King’s Regulation, similar to the Bahrain Passport Regulation, 1937, may be made under the Kuwait Order-in-Council, 1935, and enclose a draft for approval. The Shaikh of Kuwait, who has been consulted, has no objection to the making of the Regulation. 2. The references in Article 1 of the Bahrain Passport Regulation, 1937, to subjects of the Arab States of the Trucial Coast and to subjects of Saudi Arabia have been omitted from the corresponding Article of the draft asj' unlike at Bahrain, these two classes of foreigners, being Moslems, do not in Kuwait come within the jurisdiction of the Political Agent.

I ^ ^ . ^ith reference to your letter oi'the 9th Hay about Articles 67 and 66 of the Koweit Order in Council, 1935, these provisions of the 1935 Order are a simple repro duction of the co rrespond ine* provisions of the 1925 Kovveit Order in Council (see Articles 61 and 62)# iiorcover, they are simply common form as regards Orders under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, because you will find corresponding provisions in the China Order in Council, 1925,(see Articles 216 and 216) and in the £*gypt Order in Council, 1930, (see Articles 171 and 172), the last named being slightly different as regards tie documents which have to be filed. The substance of these provisions has certainly at one time or another been approved by your Department in the Board of Trade. i/ ,H«S• Marker, &amp;aq.. Companies Department, BOABB OF TRAD 8.. ■ 2 . t I ani not sore what la the particular requirement which yon think woold be likely to giro any difficulty. To take the provisions of Article 6h of the Aoweit Order in Council, I imagine the Anglo-Peraian Oil Company would have no difficulty in filing a copy of its certificate of incorporation, nor, so far as I can see, would there be any difficulty in filing a statement of the nominal capital of the Company and the amounts which have been subscribed and paid up. The Article does not in fact require the Company to do this more than once, and that is to say to keep its statement up to date in this respect (see Article 71). The last requirement is that if the Company has been incorporated under the law which provides for the periodical filing of the list of shareholders the Company shall register a cony of the last list so filed. nhat is the diffi culty with regard to this? JSither the law of the united Kingdom does require such a list of shareholders to be found in the united kingdom and, if this is so, then it is a simple matter for the Anglo-Persian Company to include a copy of this list when it first registers in Kowoit/■ ~T-J* 3. £owelt, or the law of the United Klngdcxa does not require this, in which ease the Anglo-P*r»ian Company does not have to do it in itowelt*.

Please see the previous submission at P.Z.2401/34, and the Political Resident's express letter of 5th November with its enclosures at P.Z.7270/34. After considerable delay caused by the desire not to upset the Sheikh of Koweit with other matters when he was already fully pre-occupied with the oil negotiations, His Excellency's written concurrence has now at length been obtained for the new Order in Council. It will be remembered, that the Government of India did not 0 themselves consider it necessary to consult the Sheikh at all about the new Order, since his consent to the Political Agent's jurisdiction over foreigners conferred by the Order had already been obtained in 1925, but that for technical reasons the Foreign Office thought it desirable to obtain His Excellency's concurrence again. It is clear from the enclosures to the Political Resident's express letter of 5th November that, in giving his concurrence to the new Order, the Sheikh is perfectly well aware of the extent to which he has thereby delegated jurisdiction over foreigners in Koweit. All that remains to be done now is to obtain (i*. the King's/approval for the new Order, and a draft letter to the Foreign Office requesting them to present the Order for approval is submitted accordingly.2 . 2 - o.With a view to the Order being finally printed for submission to His Majesty in Council, I am accordingly to enclose herewith, for return to H.M.Stationery Office, a special corrected proof copy of the draft^ bK /ou 1 oA^jkJsj f-0_ lo. fattiK Ao.

Fowle now says, we might send the attached draft telegram, with the caveat in the last sentence to put Major Watts on his guard against pressing the Sheikh unduly if he should prove restive.

The Hobble Lt-Colonel G.Loch, I.A., Political Resident to the Persian Gulf, Bushire.CONFIDENTIAL. Note of a conversation between Colonel Fowle and His Excellency Shaikh Sir Ahmad, Ruler of Kuwait, on 18th of July, 1934 at which Major Watts, Political Agent, Kuwait, was present; on the subject of the Shaikh 1 s attitude towards Jurisdiction over foreigners. Whiae passing through Kuwait on leave on my way to catch the Westbound Airways 1 machine at Basra, I took the opportunity to do a 'holiday task', (I had already handed over to Colonel Loch) by having a conversation with Shaikh Ahmad on various subjects - the above amongst others. I found the Shaikh looking rather puffy and Dr. Greenway informs me that he has given up the unequal struggle against corpulence; some years ago he was 16 stone but by severe dieting reduced himself to 12. 2. The Shaikh was amiable as usual. I touched on the Mylrea Case. This case is now more or less closed, and was reported by Major Watte to Colonel Loch and myself verbally in Bushire. Major Watts is following this up with a written report. My object therefore was not to exhume the case but (a) to impress on His Excellency that matters connected with British Subjects should be referred to the Political Agent before action is taken by him; (b) to ascertain indirectly, in connection with the new Order-in-Council, what the Shaikh’s attitude would be towards handing over jurisdiction of non-Moslem foreigners to us. 3* With regard to (a ). I pointed out that since Dr. Mylrea was a British subject, though employed by the AmericanAmerican Mission, it would have been more correct for His Excellency to have brought his complaint against Dr* Mylrea in the first instance to the Political Agent, instead of making it direct, without notifying Major Watts, to the headquarters of the Mission in America; the course His Excellency had actually adopted. The Shaikh frankly acknowledged that his action had been incorrect. 4. With regard to (bK In order to test the Shaikh's attitude I went on, purposely somewhat vaguely, to ask what he would do if at any time he had cause of complaint against individual foreigners, French, German, American etc., within his territory. He replied that he had nothing to do with French, German etc., Governments and would refer the case to the Political Agent* This satisfactory attitude indicates either. (i) that he - the Shaikh - is under the impression that non-Moslem foreigners are under our jurisdiction not his or (ii) that even if he regards them as under his jurisdiction he is quite willing to transfer this responsibility on to us. 5. If (i) is the case then when we submit the new Order-in-Council to the Shaikh, presumably he will be made aware of the fact that non-Moslem foreigners are at present not under our jurisdiction. However, we are bringing in the new Order-in-Council not so much vis a’vis the Shaikh as via a' vis foreign Governments, and presumably from (ii) we can deduce that his attitude should not be obstructive. Sd, T.C.Fowle Lieut-Colonel.Mr. Walton, There is likely to he a delay of some months before the oil negotiations are concluded. On the other hand, visits such as those recently paid by the French and German Ministers^and by the American Minister, emphasise the desirability of bringing the new arrangements into force with the minimum of delay. I suggest in these circumstances that we might telegraph to the Government of India ana the Resident as in the draft. If the Resident still thinks it undesirable for any local reason to press the matter (Major Watts is likely to be much less persuasive than Colonel Dickson) he can be relied on to come back. h ±_.

It will be remembered that when in 1932 it was considered desirable to amend the Koweit Order in Council in order to dispense with the obligation contained in the old Order of obtaining the consent of foreign powers to the exercise of jurisdiction over their nationals by the Political Agent at Koweit, the F.O. suggested that the change might attract less attention abroad if a completely new Order in Council were produced. After consultation between this Office, the F.O., the G.of I. and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf a new Order in Council has now been produced. The opportunity has been taken of bringing the Order up to date and there are several minor differences between the new and the old Orders^ $_it it is still true to say that the only difference of substance is that under the new Order the prior consent of foreign governments will not be necessary for the exercise of jurisdiction by the Political Agent over foreigners (other than nationals of Muslim States who remain as before under the jurisdiction of the Sheikh of Koweit). It is now proposed that the Political Agent should obtain the written consent of the Sheikh to the new Order as previously proposed by the F.O. While concurring officially in the draft telegram at P.Z.1528/34 below the F.O. suggested informally that it was desirable to make it clear in the telegram that it was not intended that the Sheikh should be asked to consent to something which he did not understand. The second paragraph, which seems/tmobjectionable, was added to the draft 3indexed In any further communication on subject, please quote No. E 1754/89/91 and address, not to any person by name., but to— “ 1 he Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. i. rs Sir, I am directed 'by Secretary Sir John Simon to acknowledge receipt of India Office letter No. P.2*1528/34 of the 16th March regarding the draft of the new Koweit Order in Council. 2. In reply I am to request you to inform Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare that Sir John Simon concurs in the terms of the draft telegram to the Government of India which was enclosed in that letter. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, The Under Secretary of State, India Office. cr*34 I think we should avoid saying anything in the telegram which assumes that the power oi extradition exists at any rate in regard to places in the Persian Gull• As regards British India* the powers undoubtedly exist under Chapter II of the Indian Extradition Act, tne procedure being laid down in section 3 or section 4* The Extradition Act of 1870 could only affect fugitive criminals of a foreign state who are in or suspected of being in any part of His Majesty*s Dominions or, under section 17, in a 'British Possession' which is defined in Section'E6 as any colony, plantation, island territory or settlement within His Majesty* s Dominions* This would therefore seem to exclude the places in the Persian Gulf. A reference to the various orders in Council relating to the Persian Gulf shows that though the Fugitive Offenders Act 1881 is made applicable, the Extradition Act 1870 is not. The Indian Extradition let 1903 is not one of the Indian Acts applied in the Orders in Council. In the Persian Coasts 1907 and Islands Order in Council/ the Maskat Order in Council and the Bahrein Order m Council xgpg 1915, there is a provision that nothing in the order is to affect the powers of jurisdiction conferred by the (Indian) Foreign jurisdiction and Extradition Act 1879 ot. in the Indian (Foreign Jurisdiction) Order in Council 190E. That Act of 1879 was repealed by the Indian Extradition Aot of 1903, and was therefore not in being when these Orders in Council came into force. As regards the Kuwait Order in Council 19B5, the corresponding provision is that nothing* in the Order shall affect any power or jurisdiction conferred by the Indian Extradition Act 1903, but in my opinion that is only intended to preserve the rights and powers as regards the surrender of fugitive criminals under the procedure in Chapter III of the Indian Extradition Act, which corresponds to the Fugitive Offenders Aot, 1881.2 / There would seem to he no power, so far as I can see in regard to the places in the Persian Gulf, by which a legal extradition order could be made, I suggest that the Foreign Office might be consulted on the point, and if they agree, the information to that effect might be communicated to the U.S.A. Embassy, and the Political Resident, Persian Gulf. (Sd.) H.G. PEARSON 22.3.34 Mr. Insull will not presumably have a visa for any of the Arab Sheikhdoms of the Gulf, and cannot land without one. I doubt if we can do more than instruct the Resident to prevent him from landing and to report at once any information as to his movements. I suggest an alteration in the draft on these lines in which the Foreign Office and their Legal Adviser concur. I think it desirable to repeat the telegram to Aden and to ask the Government of India to authorise the Chief Commissioner to take any necessary steps. A difficult question arises in the case of Kamaran. I have added a sentence (in which the Foreign Office and Colonial Office concur) to cover this. (Sd.) J.G.

The position appears to be that as a result of the new definitions of ’’Kuwait subject' and 'Foreigner' to which we have now agreed in Article 4, 'persons subject to the Order' under Article 8(1) include the following categories (i) British subjects. (ii) Foreigners who are not nationals of Muslim States. (iii) Kuwait subjects registered in the Political Agency as being in the regular service of British subjects or foreigners* 'Persons not subject to the Order' will now consist simply of 'Kuwait subjects' with the exception of those mentioned in Article 8(l)(iii), and 'Kuwait subject' as defined in Article 4 will include, besides Kuwaitis proper, 'any person, not being a British subject, who is a national of any other Muslim State'. 3. fjr^'2 think, therefore, that we shall have to make the following consequential amendments in Part V Gl&amp;s of the Order (Mixed -Giasees) to bring it into line with the position set out/out above:- (i) In Article 44(4) delete 'who is a subject either of the Shaikh or of some other Muslim Power not represented by a Consular Officer in Kuwait. (ii) In Articl e 45(4) delete 'who is a subject either of the Shaikh or of some other Muslim Power not represented by British officials in * Kuwait. (iii) In Articles44(2) and 45(2) substitute 'on behalf of the Shaikh' for 'on behalf of his own nation'. (iv) Our Legal Advisers have agreed, I think, that it will now be unnecessary to say 'Kuwait subject &amp;£ person not subject to this Order' in Articled44(2) and 45(2) and that we should read simply 'Kuwait subject' in these places. It is true that 'Kuwait subject' is not quite synonomous with 'person not subject to this Order' since some Kuwait subjects are subject to the Order under Article 8(1)(iii), but it is specifically laid down in Article 8(l)(iii) that the latter are to be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of Part 7. 4. Could you let me know as soon as possible whether the Foreign Office that agree -wyU* the amendments mentionedDraft Paper. above are purely consequential. If so we do not think that it will be necessary to consult the Grovernment of India or the Political Resident about them. (Sd.) a. E CROTUBIli,Sir Herbert Pearson, We have now received the observations of the Government of India and the Political Resident on the suggestions made in our express letters of 8th December (P.Z.7901/33) and 15th December (P.Z.7949/33) and in our telegram of 11th January and express letter of 12th January (P.Z.95/34). They have concurred in all the suggestions made except the proposed addition to the Schedule of the Indian Sale of Goods Act which they do not think is necessary. I attach a copy of the draft Order incorporating the amendments accepted up to date. I have also read through the whole Order with some care, as a result of which there are several points which I should be obliged if you would be good enough to consider. Most of these are of very small importance and I am afraid that several of them are the result of my own ignorance of legal matters, but there are a few which seem to be of some substance. First of all it should be noted tha.t new articles will have to be drafted to cover the provisions of the Ethiopia Order (Articles 30,33, 55, 56, 83, 85, 86) which it is proposed to include in the Kuwait Order (vide (l) and (2) of enclosure 2 to P.Z. 7949/33; (3) has already been incorporated; (4) and (5) are not considered necessary). These new articles will come in Part III, The points mentioned above are:- !• Article 3. ? add ’’mixed cases” before Cf. amended heading to Part V.2. » / 2. Article 3. ? ’'Schedule' for 'Schedules'. (I suppose 'India' not 'Indika' Act* is right on page 29). 3. Article 4. Definition of 'British protected \/ P ers on' was not mentioned to Government of India. ? all right. 4. Article 4. ^dcminions^sufficiently covers United Kingdom and India ? 5. Article 4. in definition of British subject (3) ^ ' l '' y ^ silould 136 'or_ mandated territories' ? 6. Article 12. 'following enactments'. Does this Phrase cover appropriately a part of an Act, e.g. Merchant Shipping Act ISSA-f Part X ? 7 ‘ Artl cle 12. I presume that there are two 'Evidence // 2* ft J . A ' &lt; / by Commission Act»,. Should the second one have a date ? 8. Does not Article 12 require sane further redrafting in regard to the position in the article of the enactments applied and the exceptions, adaptations^ etc.?- 9- Article 12 (l). Description of 'courts'. Of. Article 22. Mention of 'colony' now emitted above but , 7 all right here ? Cf.also(iuj(b) 'possession or protectorate'. •» ^ C^u^cJi _ - °- Article 18 (2). Read 'A j&amp;fefetgjtj' for ' The Warrant '. 11. Article 22 (4). ? redraft 'The place shall be a Place in that part of His Majesty's dominions.protectorate protected stated or mandated territories'... &lt; 12. Article 39 (5). 'Where a person . . . died', is clerical error ? Read 'When a person . . . dies' . ? Put 'intestate' before 'in Kuwait' and save commas. 13. Part V. Heading. ? capital letters. 14. Article 45 (4) Paragraph ? sub-article, sub-clause. 2^• Article 8 (l) iv. f 0 i - 15/15. Article 46. Mr.Beckett had suggested n person(s) to whom this order applies'. I now think that this is perhaps 'better. Otherwise, should we read 'the aforesaid person subject to this order' the second time in (l) and 'the aforesaid persons subject to this order' the second time in (2), and 'right of one of the aforesaid persons . . .' the third time in (2) ? Cf. Article 4, Article 29, etc., Article 39 (l) etc. 16. Article 60 (a). 'British prc ed persons' is covered by 'persons subject to this or ? We did not tell the Government of India that we w omitting 'British protected persons'. Perhaps it is not intended that we should ? 17. Article 67 (3). 18* Article 4. Definition of 'persons to whom this order applies' and 'persons subject to this order'. Are these persons defined in sub-paragraphs(i), (ii) (iii) of paragraph (l) of Article 8 ? If so, should we add n 'Means' should be plural anyway. U* 'C&amp;l V 'f/l.s ^ Kjl\ ? sub-paragraph vii ?- 19. Article 8 (l) (iv) and (v). ? delete 'within sub-article ii' in both places ? /) (hiJ (f if) Sub-art icle ? Cf. Article 45 (4). 20. Article 39 ( 2 ). Mr .Be ckeiTf''stages ted reference to Article 80 (l) of ilt-hi opia Order. No amendment necessary ? 21. Article 45 (6). Delete 'district' as in 1 ? 22. Page 20. '(c) General'; stet 4 9 ^ 23. Page 23. I presume that a provision like Article 105 of the Ethiopia Order is not required. The Government of India and the Resident apparently think not. 24. Heading to Part III. Part IV. AvJ 'Criminal Matter s' ? Cf.4 . 25. Article 22 (3). ? punctuation, phrasing,etc. 26. Article 23. ? insert 'of' before 'deportation'. ■ ' 27. Article 25 (4). The reference to an English Court is all right ? 28. Article 27. ? insert 'both” before flast line* as in Article 26. 29. Article 39 (3). End of brackets should come after ”inventory”. 30. Article 42 (2). ’’indemnif^thereby” ? meaning. 31. Part V. As a result of the amendments made in Articles 4 and 8 there will now be two categories:- (1) Kuwait subjects who are not subject to the order, (2) Persons subject to the order. ^ C &lt; (1) includes any person not being a British subject it who .is the national of any other Muslim sta.te (2) includes all foreigners who are not Kuwait subjects under the definition in Article 4. Part V of the order seems to me to require a good deal of revision to bring it into line with the amendments made in Articles 4 and 8. Should we read ’’Kuwait subject to whom this order does not apply” (or 'Kuwait subject who is not subject to this order) in the first lines of Article 44J^l) and (2)? ? delete in Article 44 (4) ' who is a subject either of the Shaikh .... consular official in Kuwait.' Would it be clearer to say in the second line 'a Kuwait subject to whom the said order does not apply (or**who is not subject to the said order ”) ? The same difficulty arises in Art icle 45 (l) and (2). ? read 'Kuwait subject to whom this order does not apply' or simply 'person tot subject to this order'. The/*1 5. The phrase 'on behalf of his own nation' in Article 44 (2) and Article 45 (2) now seems wrong in view of the new definition of'Kuwait subject'in Article 4. Can we read 'on behalf of the Shaikh' in both places ? Similarly in Article 45(5) the phrase 'who is a subject either of the Shaikh or of some other Musl im . Power not represented by British officials in Kuwait' now seems unnecessary, in view of the new definitions of 'foreigner' and 'Kuwait subject'. It seems best simply to delete this phrase but I am not quite clear as to the reason for its inclusion in the old order. I do not know of any Muslim Power (outside the British Thipire) which can properly be said to be 'represented by British officials in Kuwait'. Possibly the reference was to Persians but we have only promised Persians 'good offices' and the Shaikh, as we know, is strongly against any interference with his jurisdiction over them. I presume that Iraqis are not 'represented by British officials in Kuwait'. The Foreign Office will perhaps be able to advise whether it is safe to delete the phrase in question as a purely consequential amendment without a further reference to the Government of India or the Resident. If we have to retain a phrase on these lines we might read in the second line 'against a Kuwait subject to whom this order does not apply and who is not a national of a Muslim state represented by British officials in Kuwait'. But it seems preferable to omit altogether the^phrase 'who is the subject .... British officials in Kuwait'. Article 46 (3). ? add after 'Kuwait subject' the cr'l S' words 'to whom this order does not apply' i-nst-ead^^ '5 r t - * ^ # f ' * '‘ftUWff.i-t—subj oolr^* yUAXcrvv 7^ ‘V’ Uv. I' ' ? read in second line 'such award/ 32. Article 45 (3)award” for ”the same'. 33. Article 48 (2). ? add after 'attend' the words 'before a Kuwait tribunal' and read 's_o ordered to attend'. 34. Article 53. ? transpose 'on the passport' to come after 'endorse'. 35. Article 60 (a). Second paragraph. Should the penalty apply to any person subject to the order or only to British subjects. ? read 'person subject to this order' for 'British subject'. 36. Article 67 (2) 'this order' not 'his order'. 37. Article 70 (3). /should British subjects be treated differently to other persons to whom the order applies ? Cf. Article 60 (a) second paragraph. 38. Article 78 (e). ' British ' is all right ? 39. Article 82. Fourth line. ? read f or ' or '. &lt;/*v 40. Article 83 (i). ? omit which is restrictive^the second time it occurs. 41. Article 85, line 10. ? read 'pr^ceyding' instead of 'last'. last line. the W/drd 'being' ? Would it be clearer to emit 42. When the new provisions from the Ethiopia order have been drafted it will be necessary to renumber the articles correctly (cf. also Article 3 where various articles are referred to). It will also be necessary to revise the footnotaysince several new enactments are referred to in the body of the order. 43.

Draft Order in Council has now been examined here in consultation with F.O. who have suggested several.amend ments which are mostly of purely legal or drafting character. 3. Suggestions of more substantial importance are: (1) re-definition of M Koweit subject” in Article 4 (see para.5 below) and ( 2 ) proposal to delete all words ^ ‘A yrf (foqlet) after ’’Foreigners” in Art .8 {l)(fL)i{^on the ground that, if ’’Koweit subject” and ’’British subject” are defined as proposed in paragraphs 5 and J below, the expression ’’Foreigner” as defined in Art.4 will adequately cover all those foreigners in respect of whom we wish Sheikh to consent to our exercise of jurisdiction. Article 8 (l) 4ti4 would: then read ’’Foreigners, as herein defined, within the limits of this Order”. 4. With regard to (2) since proposed method of obtaining Sheikh’s consent s • iis simply to obtain his written concurrence in the new Order (see IS-Express letter of* 10th February 1933, No.P. Z .296/33), I am inclined to ^ fftvoup*»this amendment which might reduce risk of which Foreign Office were apprehensive of later accusation of j having obtained Sheikh’s consent without his be^iig aware that he was giving it. 5. With regard to (l), F.O. point out that the expression ’’Muslim Power” used in present definition of ’’Koweit subject” is an expression of somewhat vague and doubtful meaning. For example Great Britain and the Netherlands are sometimes so described owing to the numbers of their Muslim subjects^ stftd rae ti nn-ef^She subjects of a Muslim Indian or Malay also be doubtful under the present def iiu^tlon. State might definition/is therefore ^p^oposed fo r / The following l f ~ * ”Koweit subject” 1 'Koweit subject” means a subject of the Sheikh of Koweit or any person, not being a British subject, who is the -subject- of any other ^ add- iiidepeudciii/ Muslim State • This definition may not be entirely satisfactory but it has not been possible to find a better one which expresses the meaning required. ^ ^ ^ t * We have considered as an alternative/ V -J s i * X /V. ^ tr ^ k&gt;v\ y Wi-Draft Paper Department alternative a definition of 'Koweit subject'* as 'any person, not being a • British subject, who is a Muslim', but this is open to objection in that it would remove from the P.A’s. jurisdiction Muslim subjects of non- Muslim Foreign Governments.

I should oe grateful to receive as soon as possible by telegraph your views and those of the Political Resident on the questions raised in paras.3 to £ above. The matter is of some urgency owing to rumours of renewed American interest in Koweit (vide Political. Resident's telegram No.1066, of 28th November /753 ). It is also proposed to revise the definition of 'British 1925 5000 6.33 subject'/subject” in Article 4 in accordance with modern practice (vide India Office letter of 13th November 1933 to P.O., copy of which was sent to you by Air Mail of 24th November and to Bushire by Air Mail of 1st December under No. P.

Beckett, of the F.O., mentioned the following point on the telephone. If the method by which we obtain the Sheikh’s -v*v*&gt;** /hf ?(') (fl zk-^/'^WvC consent^/to the exercise of jurisdiction over non-Foslem foreigners is merely by obtaining his written concurrence in the revised draft Order in Council, then it is necessary that 'foreigners' should be defined in such a way as to exclude non-Moslems. The definition of 'foreigner' m Art. excludes Koweit subjects, and the exclusion of all non-Moslems can be obtained by an appropriate definition of 'Koweit subject', so as to make the latter include all Moslems who are not British subjects. The definition of 'Koweit subject' in Art. 21 does not quite go so far as this. ’ r. Beckett thinks that something of the following sort % would be better:- '’Koweit subject’ means a subject of the Sheikh of Koweit and any person, not being a British subject, who is a Mes1en.' I personally agreed that, since we intend to proceed by reiGj.y obtaining the Sheikh’s concurrence mMinute Paper. Department. H' f 3 The proposed method of obtaining the Sheikh’s consent to oar exercising jurisdiction over the subjects of non-Moslem Powers is to obtain his written concurrence in the draft Order (see para. 5 of F.O. letter of 13th Jan. (P.Z. 296); para. 2 of our express letter to the G. of I. of 10th Feby.; para. 2 of the G. of I.'s express letter to Bushire of 24th Feby. (P.Z. 1327)). The idea was that such written concurrence would constitute the consent of the Sheikh provided for in Ej^2j of the draft Order. Now Mr. Beckett proposes that all the words after 'foreigners' in should be omitted, and that we should make sure by the definitions that 'foreigners' means all those foreigners in respect of whom we wish the Sheikh to consent to our exercising jurisdiction. His consent would then be clearly obtained by his expression of concurrence in the draft Order. I am inclined to think that Mr. Beckett’s plan is preferable, as there would be less risk of our being accused afterwards of having obtained the Sheikh’s consent to this jurisdiction without his being aware that he was giving it. But as the previous plan was proposed partly with the object of lessening the risk of the Sheikh raising objections, it will be best to consult the G. of I. and the Resident in the Persian Gulf before departing from it. I think that the best plan would be !j| that, after your discussion v/ith Mr. Beckett, we should send out to the G. of I. and to Bushire so much of his 2110 5000 8.33 memo, as relates to the definitions and to the above point/point, and ask for their concurrence in it. As regards the definitions, please see Mr. Crombie's note below. It is important that in the definition of 'Koweit subject 11 we should retain the words 'subject ... of any other Moslem Power', rather than say 'who is a Moslem'. AnL**- A. tuv*. l n*r&gt;U^ &gt;yrt^. There appears to be another small point in Mr. Beckett's definitions. If 'Bdtish protected person' is defined as excluding Koweit subjects, and if 'Koweit subjects' is defined as including any person, not being a British subject, who is a Moslem, 'British protected persons' would appear to be defined as excluding Moslem British protected persons. This is, incidentally, another reason for defining 'Koweit subject' as 'a subject of the Sheikh of Koweit or any person, not being a British subject, who is the subject of any other Moslem Power'j 4* s &gt; S'-iA.% FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W. 1. November 24, 1933. Dear Pearson, The India Office, in a letter of the 13th November signed by tfalton, No. PZ. 5 406/33, have sent us the draft of a new Order in Council for Koweit, and I have been going through this draft. In the course of doing so, I have come across a large number of points and, as they are nearly all of them of a purely legal and drafting character, I think it would be most satisfactory if the Legal Advisers of the two Departments•could consider the matter together instead ©C trying to deal with them by official correspondence. I am enclosing (l) the draft Koweit Order sent to us by the India Office, and on which is shown in very untidy manu script the points I have in my mind, and (2) a very rough memorandum with regard to these points. I think, however, points of this kind are much more easily settled and dealt with by discussion than by corres- pondence and if you agree I should be very glad at some time convenient to us both to come over and go through them all with you or any of your colleagues, if you prefer to pass it on to someone else. In the case of this Order in Council it is more/more difficult for me than usual to be sure of my ground because (a) the basis of the latf to be applied in Koweit is Indian Lav/ and not English Law, and (b) I have very little knowledge about the manner in which things are really run in Koweit. Yours sincerely, P.S. If you are ready to discuss these points as I suggest, can I assume, in order to save my bringing over a number of books, that you will be able to get hold, in the India Office, of the copies of any English Statute or Statutory Rules and Orders that we may want? It would also be con- ' veniant, I think, if we had available some spare copies of the draft Order as sent by the Government of *ndia in order that we can insert upon it the amendments on whichkiiliaQll Ahi DUk. It will be convenient to take first of all the following points together: (a) The definition of 'Koweit subject' in .article 4 and Article 8 (l) (ii). The scheme, as I understand it, is that in respect of foreigners in koweit British jurisdiction is exercised by delegation and at the request of the Ruler of koweit. This delegation and request is to take the form of the approval by the Ruler Ajad the relevant provisions of this Order when they have been explained to tton by the political agent. It is i#&amp;£a&amp;fced that we should exercise jurisdiction under the Order over (i) all British subjects and protected persons, (ii) all^persons who are not koweit subjects and who are not Moslems. Upon these hypotheses the Order in Council itself must express the po$ifion, otherwise the scheme does not work. This means the amendment of the definition of 'Koweit subject' and also of article 8 (l) (ii). I propose that a .uoweit subject should be defined as being a subject of the Bheix of noweit, or any person, not being a British subject, who is a moslem. (b) Then follows a definition of 'British protected persons” as meaning persons properly enjoying His kajesty’s protection in moweit, but not including foreigners or Koweit subjects who are persons subject to this Order under Article 8 (1) (ii) and (i i i ), (c) Then follows a definition of 'British subjects' as meaning (l) British subjects proper, (2) British protected \ persons and (o) cor iterations incorporated under the law of any part of His majesty’s Dominions, rrotectorates, irotected &lt;^0 States and mandated Territories;^ foreigners are defined as being not British or Koweit subjects. article 8 (l) in defining/ fairs*, li*defining the persons subject to the Order includes (l) British subjects, as above defined, a nd ( 2 ) foreignera .*^ A new sub-para, (vii) should, I think, be added to article 8 (l) so as to include within the Order British subjects outside the limits of the Order on whom a writ or summons or other process may be served wirtbi'n the nules of the Court. If these amendments are made, then I think it does give effect to the scheme as I understand it. (j M ^ V article 8 (0). I think we must include here aircraft belonging to foreigners (compare position as regards ships above). The references to the x^ir Navigation Act should, I think, be cut out; they have now been cut out of the corresponding draft Ethiopia Order, because it is Indian law and not the lav/ of the United kingdom on which these Orders are both based, xjc'ticle 8 (2). This I think requires amendment, and in doing so it will be convenient to combine it with xj:ticle and make the text read, ’’If a question arises whether any place is within the 'limits of this Order or whether any person is a British 'protected person or a foreigner as defined in this Order 'such question may be referred ' etc. Article 12. This article follows the scheme of maxing all the Acts scheduled to the foreign Jurisdiction Act apply to Koweit. In the first place I think that this is not a convenient way of doing it from the position of persons who have to interpret the Older. It would, I think, make it simpler from their point of view if the individual ^cts which it is intended to make applicable in x^oweit ohottlda^rB dealt with in separate articles and in that portion of the Order treating the subjects with which these nets deal. This is the manner in which it is done in the Ethiopia Order, further, if nrticle 19 (4) is looked at, it will be seen thatsome *xob3 are treated in two bits in the draft Order. Farther, in a place where Indian lav/ is the basis ought all these acts to be applied? In the case of Ethiopia the Evidence Act 1851 is left out. In connexion with the Fugitive Offenders Act, it would be advisable, I think, to state that this Act shall only apply to British subjects. I think the Colonial irrisoners' Removal Act 1884 might be made applicable in Aoweit. Article 18. I think it may be advisable to add a second paragraph, making the warrant authority to any person it is directed to receive and direct the person therein named, etc. 2.1 Article . I suggest that in the case dealt with there should be an alternative of requiring the accused to give security for good behaviour. article BE. I think the case of a man failing during the continuance of the security to keep the peace or be of good i behaviour should be included. Article 31. I do not think this .article is right. Such provisions as may be necessary to implement treaties should be made by king’s regulation. A treaty does not, as such, bind individuals. (Compare on this point article 78 (bi.) I think a reference to the Foreign Jurisdiction (Military Forces) Order in Council 1927 should be made. There is a question whether some provision on the lines of articles 30, 33, 55 and 56 of the Ethiopia Order in Council should not be inserted in this Oruer, Article 39, paragraph 5. I think that something on the Ik* •-ft**' lines of Article 80 (l)^is more appropriate. Surely this Article ought to be made applicable, not merely to British subjects, but to all persons subject to the Order, ^rticle 40. I do not understand the words ”to the ”establishment of whose title as such it is necessary to ' obtai n/’’obtain probate”. After article 41. iuery: Insert something on the lines of Article 83 of the Ethiopia Order. I think a provision on the lines of Article 85 of the Ethiopia Order might be included. Should not the Foreign Jurisdiction Irobates Order in Council 1908 be made applicable in Koweit (compare Article 86 civil cases. v 5. of the Ethiopia Order). There seems to be no provision whatever for appeals in This strikes me as being odd. I do not think. th€ title is happy. Would it not be better to say 'kixed Cases: Aoweit Subjects and Persons ’’Subject to Shis Order”? Article 45 (3). I suggest an addition - ’’unless the ’’first two conditions of paragraph 2 above are fulfilled”. Paras. 5 and 6 of this xjrticle seem to me to be out of place. Article 46. Should not this refer throughout to persons to whom the Order applies instead of to British subjects? The sub-title ”C. General” seems to me to be unnecessary Article 49. Should not the Court be given power to enforce a judgment given by the koweit Tribunal in these oases? Article 60. This Article appears to be out of place as it interprets the registration provisions of the Order; I think it should come just before 68. Presumably at should apply to all persons subject to the Order. Article 61. i think we must now speak of companies registered, etc. in the United kingdom or in any part of His majesty’s Dominions, protectorates. Protected States or Mandated Territories. I think the registration of companies k ought to be made compulsory. Article 67. Should not a provision be added on the lines/lines of para, 12 of Article 123 of the Ethiopia Order. In the Ethiopia Order provision is made for the regis tration of foreigners to whom the Order applies (see Article 124 of the Ethiopia Order). ^uery: Is not this desirable in Koweit? Is it desirable to include an ^article on the lines of Article Q8 of the Ethiopia Order? See Articles 104 to 107 of the Ethiopia Order. Perhaps these Articles are unnecessary in a place where Indian law applies, but I think this point ought to be investigated. November 24, 1933.Register No. P.Z. SECKE'7' 5406/33 Political Department.

Please see the submission at P*Z.296/33. After consultation with the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf the Govt, of India have now # forwarded a draft of the proposed new Koweit Order in Council. The additions and alterations which have been made in the old Order in Council are explained in the Govt, of India’s covering letter. The Govt, of India’s draft has been referred to the Legal Adviser who has suggested certain amendments (please see the reference to the Legal Adviser below with Sir Herbert Pearson's note of 28th September). With regard to para. 2 of the Legal Adviser's note, foreign companies appear to be sufficiently covered by the existing definition 'foreigner' in conjunction with the definition of 'person' in Art. 4 of the Order and Sir Herbert Pearson now agrees that it might be as well to make no alteration in Art. 8 (|), (fc) in view of the danger of drawing too much attention to the treatment of foreigners under the Order. As regards para. 3 of the Legal Adviser's note theobject of the additions made by the Govt, of India ( 7 ) . in Art.llU*^ of the Order is apparently to avoid the reissue of King's Regulations already made by the Political Resident under Art. 78(c) in order to modify certain of the Indian Acts included in the schedule to the Order. The reissue of these King's Regulations by the Political Resident would involve further correspondence, since they require the assent of,a S.of S. and the Regulations would have to be CLk**. in Koweit which migjnt have an unsettling effect/effect upon the Sheikh who might imagine that they involved some new departure. I have discussed the matter with Sir Herbert Pearson who points out that ft) the objection to Art. in the form now suggested by the Govt, of India is really one of drafting, since if it is found necessary in future to issue further King’s Regulations under Art. 78(c) a position will arise in which the Acts in the schedule are modified partly in the body of the Order itself and pantly by the new Regulations which may tend to be confusing. The Legal Adviser is prepared to waive his objection if it is considered that the further correspondence involved would be undesirable and perhaps,, on the ft) whole, it might be better to leave Art.lLW^r) as it stands in the Govt, of India’s draft. A draft letter to the F.O. incorporating the suggestions made by the Legal Adviser as modified in the ligjrt of further discussion is put up for approval. The modifications made by the Govt, of India in the old Order do not amoux&amp; to Very much but it is possible that the F.O. may have further amendments to suggest. Legal Adviser. For the favour of concurrence in the draft.Draft Paper. 1 P.Z.5406/33 political Department. U.S.S., F.O.

(2) Since Arts. 61-67 of the draft relate to the registration of companies it seems advisable to make company procedure under the relevant Indian legislation available in case of need. Sir Samuel Hoare would suggest that this might be done by the addition of the Indian Companies Act 1913 (Act No. / of 1913) to the schedule attached to the Order. 2. The S.of S. would be glad to receive in due course such observations as the S.of S. for F.A. may have to offer upon the draft Order in Council.Mr. horlev. 'British subject' should also be defined to include any corporation incorporated under the law of the United Kingdom, India, or any part of His Majesty’s Dominions, Protectorates or Mandated Territories (cf. Ethiopia draft Order in Council Article 3 (iii) and see Article 61-67 Kuwait draft). Companies. This subject has already been discussed in connection with the Ethiopia draft Order in Council (see Legal Adviser’s note dated 27. 10. 31 on attached file). Probably it would meet the case if the Indian Companies Act 1913 were added to the schedule, and 'Foreigners' in Article 8 (1) (2) were made to include foreign companies: unless it is thought that this would direct attention too much to this alteration. Article 61 to 67 of the draft relate to registration of companies, and it would a.ppear to be advisable to make company procedure under the Indian Act available in case of need. As compared with the corresponding provision of the Order in Council of 1925 this contains additions in so far that it applies certain Indian Acts specified under (i) (ii) and (iii) as modified to the extent there stated. It would seem more appropriate to leave Article 11 (2) in the general form in which it stood in the 1925 Order in Council, and to include in the schedule at the end any such fresh enactments whose application is desired, leaving the matters now dealt with in (i) (ii) and (iii) to be made the subject of King's regulations under Article 78 (c). This is the procedure in fact adopted under the Order in Council of 1925 as appears from the papers in the bound file, and I do not understand that the necessity has emerged for anything different. So far as I can see there can be no Dft.O. in C. Art. 4 Art. 11 (2) 4 - -5 *no reason for differentiating between the treatment of the enactments in (i) (ii) and (iii) and that of the enactments in the Schedule. Possibly the provisions of Article 78 (c) are wide enough to authorise modifications by King’s regulations subsequently whether the enactments are set out in the body of the Order in Council or in the Schedule, but it only tends to confusion to treat some in one way and some in the other. The mention of the Imperial enactments in the Order in Council e.g. in Article 12 and 19 (4) is not open to the same objection, because the Schedule confines itself to the Indian Acts. 28th September, 1933.'i GOVERNMENT OF INDIA.

The F.O. feel however that although the language used by the Sheikh in 1925 was unconditional^ his consent was nevertheless conditional strictly speaking upon the consent of the Foreign Governments also being obtained. Judging from the correspondence in 1925 between the Sheikh and the Political Agent, there is not a great deal in the Foreign Office point of view, but in view of their scruples and in order to be on the safe side it may be as well, if the G.of I. and the Political Resident see no objection, to obtain from the Sheikh an unconditional confirmation of his consent to the exercise by the Political Agent of jurisdiction over the subjects and protected persons x in Koweit of all non-Muslim Governments. Meanwhile there is no need to hold up any longer the preparation of the new draft Order. A draft express letter to the G.of I. is submitted accordingly.P.Z.296/33.

Sir, 13th January, 1933. - ^ ' I am directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to offer, for the consideration of Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare, the following observations on India Office letter No. ^•2* 6946/32 of the 6th December regarding jurisdiction over foreigners in Koweit. 2. Sir John Simon, while thinking It unnecessary to suggest to the Sheikh of Koweit that he should cede to His Majesty s Government jurisdiction over Moslem foreigners within his territory, is not satisfied, for the following reasons, that the consent to the exercise of jurisdiction by His Majesty's Government over non-Moslem foreigners in Koweit, which was obtained from the Sheikh in 1925, can be held to cover the arrangement which it is now desired to make . 3 • The object of the correspondence of October- November, 1925, between the Sheikh and the Political Agent at Koweit, copies of which were enclosed In the India Office letter to the Foreign Office No. P. 438 of the 17th February, 1926, was to obtain from the Sheikh his consent to the delegation to His Majesty's Government of jurisdiction over foreigners, as required by the Koweit Order- in-Council of 1825 * le tter No. 342 of the 24tb October 1925 from Major More to the Sheikh begins with a summary of section 1 of Article 8 of that Order mentioning specifically the proviso that the The Under-Secretary of State, India Office . foreigners 3PY SENT BY AIR MAIL gf i olll) 3 -4' Vforeigners over whom His Majesty^ Government are to exercise jurisdiction in Koweit are those f, with respect 'to whom the State, King, Chief or Government whose 'subjects or protected persons they are, have agreed to 'the exercise of jurisdiction by His Majesty'. The remainder of the correspondence is for the most part an explanation of this article, regarding which the Sheikh desired further particulars. 4. It is true that, in not expressly mentioning the necessity for obtaining the consent of foreign Governments to the exercise of jurisdiction by His Majesty f s Government, the Sheikh seems to have been ready to grant more than His Majesty f s Government desired to ask at that time. Nevertheless Sir John Simon does not consider that, strictly speaking, he could on that account be held to have agreed to the exercise of jurisdiction without the consent of the other Governments concerned, should any dispute arise on this point. 5. It is not clear from the telegram from the Government of India No. 2560 of the 16th November, a copy of which was enclosed in your letter No. P.Z. 6946/52 of the 17th November, whether they would see difficulty in obtaining from the Sheikh a further written consent to the exercise of jurisdiction by His Majesty’s Government over non-Moslem foreigners only. I am therefore to enquire whether Sir Samuel Hoare would see objection to this course. The Sheikh’s communication could be couched in general terms, perhaps simply in the form of concurrence in the new draft Order-in-Council. His Majesty's Government would not thenthen be under an obligation to the Sheikh, as in Sir John Simon*s view they must strictly be considered to be at present, to obtain the prior consent of foreign Governments to the exercise of jurisdiction over their nationals, and each case could be treated on its merits as it arose under whatever article of the new Order-in- Council corresponded with Article 8 (2) of the present Order • 6.

Please see the minutes on P.Z.5538/32 and the C.O.letter of 31st October just below. From the Sheikh of Koweit f s letter of 4th November 1925 (P.488/26 in the bound volume) it is quite clear that he has already delegated jurisdiction over all non-Moslem foreigners, which is all that is required by us, and we may agree with the Government of India that it would be inadvisable to approach the Sheikh again to obtain a written request for our exercise of jurisdiction. He was very emphatic in 1925 that he would not surrender jurisdiction over Moslem foreigners. If the F.O. and C.O. agree, we may ask the Government of India to proceed with the preparation of the new draft Order in Council. The Government of India have had copies of all the correspondence upon the new draft Ethiopia 0. in C.,which the F.O. suggest may be of assistance in drafting the Koweit Order. * A draft letter to the F.O.and C.O.is submitted. l/e C &lt;*— va. cy(&gt;\ o-ocT a-«&gt;€ IAA HU uxLcA ^ ' lS ^ tku cJtJ/U I fat ' ig: 'lAX.P.Z.6946/32. 6th December, 1932 Sir, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to forward for the information of the Secretary of State for the Colonies copy of a telegram of 16th November from the Government of India on the subject of jurisdiction over foreigners in Koweit. 2. Sir Samuel Hoare agrees with the Government of India that in the circumstances explained and in view of the fact that the Sheikh has already agreed to surrender jurisdiction over all non-Moslem foreigners, and the improbability of his agreeing to surrender jurisdiction over Moslem foreigners, it would be unnecessary and inadvisable to endeavour to obtain the written request of the Sheikh for the exercise by His Majesty of jurisdiction «ver all foreigners in Koweit. in this connection, I am to refer to the letter of 4th November, 1925 from the Sheikh to the Political Agent, a copy of which formed the last enclosure to India Office printed letter No.P.488/26 dated 17th February, 1926. Subject to the concurrence of the Secretary of State for the Colonies in regard to the above, Sir Samuel Hoare now proposes to instruct the Government of India to prepare the draft of a new Koweit Order in Council in coneultation with the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, as suggested in Colonial Office letter No.98123/32 of 31st October. 3.

Subject to the concurrence of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in regard to the above, Sir Samuel Hoare now proposes to instruct the Government of India to prepare the draft of a new Koweit Order in Council in consultation with the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, as suggested in Colonial Office letter No.98123/32 of 31st October. 3.

The unratified Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913 specifically provides that Koweit shall form an autonomous Kaza of the Ottoman idnpire and goes on to make provision for the flying by the Sheikh *as in the past* of the Ottoman flag with, if he wishes, the word '’Koweit rt inscribed in the comer. 2 .

The Residency, Bushire, 24th June, 1932. My dear Parkinson, In continuation of my despatch No. 21, dated v* the 10th June, 1932, regarding Kuwait oil, I enclose a . —— ' note prepared by my office on the question of jurisdiction over foreigners in Kuwait, and suggest that the matter should be considered with others arising from the Eastern and General Syndicated application for a concession. The possibility of a large number of non-Moslem foreigners arriving in Kuwait in the near future renders it very desirable that a definite decision should be arrived at. I am sending a copy of this letter to India. Yours sincerely, (Signed) H.V.Biscoe. A.C.C. Parkinson, Esq., C.M.G., O.B.E., The Colonial Office, London.v4 ^ \ Letter dated 17th Rabi II 1344 (4th November, 1925) from the Shaikh of Kuwait to the Political Agent, r Kuwait, conreyed the former 1 e consent to the exercise by the latter of jurisdiction over the subjects and protected persons in Kuwait of all non*Muslim Foreign Powers* It is further amplified in the exchange of letters between the two, forwarded under cover of Political Agent’s memorandum No. 424/32/11, dated the 12th December, 1925. This is satisfactory vis-k-vis the Shaikh but under Section 8(1) (2) of the Kuwait Order in Council the Political Agent’s jurisdiction extends only over such non- Muslim foreigners 'with respect to whom the Shaikh of Kuwait and any State, King, Chief or Government whose subjects or under whose protection they are have agreed with His Majesty for, or consented to, the exercise of jurisdiction by His Majesty.' As in 1926 - vide India Office letter No. P.808, dated the 11th March, 1926 - so at present, no Foreign Power has consented to the exercise of jurisdiction over its nationals in Kuwait by His Majesty, and the Government of India orders (Foreign and Political Department letter No. 210-N, dated 26th April, 1926) are that when the necessity arises steps should be taken to ascertain from the Government of the person concerned whether they desire that the case should be dealt with under the Order in Council. This state of affairs has hitherto led to no inconvenience but it will in the event of the influx of a large number of Americans into Kuwait and, if it is necessary, it would be as well to obtain the formal consent of the United States Government to the exercise ofof jurisdiction over its subjects in Kuwait by His Majesty. It will be seen from Foreign Office letter No. S.2406/31/ P. 91, dated 11th April, 1922, to the Colonial Office that the Foreign Office considered this point in 1922. I have said ’’if it is necessary” in the preceding paragraph because an alternative much to be preferred, if it is practicable, would be the amendment of Section 8 ( 1 } ( 2 ) of the Kuwait Order in Council to read the same as the corresponding section of the Bahrain Order in Council i.e. omission of the necessity for the consent of Foreign lowers. So far as the subjects of non-Muslim rowers are concerned the right of jurisdiction ceded to His Majesty f s Government by the Shaikh of Kuwait is no less than that ceded by the Shaikh of Bahrain, and if in Bahrain His Majesty's Government exercises such jurisdiction without the prior formal consent of Foreign lowers it seems illogical to seek such consent in the case of Kuwait. Further, it seems to me that the attempt to secure such formal consent from, say, the Government of the United States of .Unerica in regard to Kuwait would lead that Government to question the right of His Majesty's Govern ment to act without it in the case of Bahrain. Section 6 ( 2 ) of the draft Bahrain Order in Council drawn up by the Government of India in 1911 contained a restriction similar to that contained in Section 8 ( 1 ) ( 2 ) of the present Kuwait Order in Council. The Foreign Office however held in 1912 (Foreign Office letter dated 12 th March, 1912, to the India Office) that the section was unnecessarily elaborate, that our right of -of jurisdiction oirer foreigners was claimed under grant from the Shaikh and not under agreement with other Foreign Governments concerned and suggested the form which was eventually adopted i.e. ignoring the necessity for the consent of Foreign Powers. In a personal letter dated 26th November, 1912, Colonel Trevor pointed out to Sir Percy Cox the objection that a Foreign Power might make to this assumption of jurisdiction by His Kajesty T e Government but the point does not seem to have been pursued further. The war intervened and the introduction of the Order in Council was delayed for many years. In 1922 the Foreign Office had the same set of facts before them as in 1912 but drew the opposite conclusion. It is a decade later now, and perhaps too late ever to go back to the outlook of 1912, but if it can be done it would save a deal of trouble not only in regard to Kuwait but probably also in regard to Bahrain.Sir, J 7 (J British Residency and Consul ate-General, ^Bushire,, the 10th June 19o2. : r-' [jzj I have the honour to invite a reference to ^ny despatch No .20 of the 7th June, with which I forwarded a draft of the concession presented by Major Frank Polmes to the Shaikh of Kuwait, and to submit herewith certain comments thereon. 2. This is the third concession that ; ajor Holmes has submitted to the Shaikh since I have been here. The first was forwarded to you with my despatch No. 38 of the 17th September 1930. The second was sent with my demi-official letter No. 298-S of the 26th May 1931 to dir John Jhuckburgh as 1 was on the point of leaving for England. The general conditions of these three concessions are similar, and I would invite attention to the suggestions put forward in my despatch 0.42., dated the ^th October 1930, which with the exception of the reference to the nationality clause, apply equally to the present concewsion. 3. The chief distinction between the three concessions is in the area to oe leased. In the first concession no specific area is mentioned and the reference throughout is to Kuwait territory: in the second the area is 640 square miles divided into as many blocks as the Company choose while in the present concession the area is no less than 1640 square miles. -H 1 His Majesty 1 a decretory of State for the Colonies, Colonial Office, London.4. The previous concession was very severely criticised by the Director of the Gf#ological Survey of India from the technical point of view. I would venture to state that I entirely agree, from the political point of view, with his view that the expression 'conceded territory' is open to the gravest objection, and with that expressed by the Government of India that anything suggesting an imperium in imperio should be avoided, and that it should be definitely laid down in the agreement that the Oompany’s employes shall be subject to the administrative and legal aatiiority of the Shaikh to the same extent as other foreigners resident in Kuwait territory. D. ITie area of 164U square miles would certainly seem to be very excessive, but if the proposal made by the Director of the leological Survey of India is accepted and a dead renc charged# it will presumably be very considerably reduced. 6 . Doctor Feravr points out that clause 5 would preclude the exercise of pre-emption in time of war# either by the Shaikh of Kuwait or the British Government as it is proposed to insist on this right of pre-emption vide your telegram lie. o, dated the 9 th lay 19o2 - I premne this necessary amendment will be made. Inpara graph 26 of hie note the Director of the iieologioal uiirvey of India has further suggested that His Majesty'a Government should object to Major Frank Holmes being Chief local Representative in Kuwait ae well as in Bali rain. I entirely agree with this view, i'he Company have apparently struck oil in Bahrain and it is probable thatthat they will in consequence in the near future consider ably extend their operations and increase the number of uheir employes. If so, there will be many matters of detail arising for discussion between the Company and the Bahrain Government, and it is essential that the local Representative of the Company should be permanently located at Bahrain. At present Major holmes only visits it periodically, and it is obvious that he cannot attend to the work in Bahrain if he also occupies a similar position at Kuwait. I may mention that I do not consider Major Holmes a particularly desirable person, and should be glad to see him replaced by some one else in Bahrain when occasion offers. in any case, however, he should not be the local Representative in Kuwait. 7. I would suggest that in view of the opinion expressed by the director of the geological burvey of India in paragraph 15 of his note an entirely fresh concession should be drafted embodying those of his suggestions which His Majesty's Government consider desirable to incorporate and also the safeguards and that it should be discussed with the Syndicate in London on the understanding that it does not necessarily bind the Shaikh. I regard discussions out here as very unsatisfactory, as the Shaikh is a child in the hands of Major Holmes, while neither Colonel Dickson nor I possess any technical knowledge. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Government of India. I have, etc., (Sgd.) H.V. BISCOE. Lt .Col., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.CONFIDENTIAL. INDIA OFFICE, ,, KOWEIT, 1908-1928. 0 , A.—Administration. 1. Sheikh Ahmad-al Jabir, C.I.E. (January 1922', born 1885, has ruled Koweit since March 1921, when his succession to his uncle, Sheikh Salim (born 1864, succeeded 1917, died 23rd February 1921), who had ruled since the death of Sheikh Jabir Ibn Mabarak in 1917, was recognised by His Majesty’s Government, subject, it would appear, to agreement to impose and enforce through his territory such further restrictions on the arms traffic as might be considered desirable. On the invitation of His Majesty’s Government, the Sheikh visited the United Kingdom in October 1919, as the representative of his uncle, with the son of Ibn Sand, and was received by the King. His Excellency is entitled to a permanent salute of seven guns, the number having been reduced from 12 (personal) on his accession. 2. The principality is an independent Arab State, under British protection, but not a British protectorate. 0 Its ruler is precluded by his engagements, of which an abstract is printed in the Precis of Treaties appended to this Memorandum, from receiving foreign representatives, and from ceding, leasing, mortgaging, or giving for occupation, or any other purpose, any portion of its territory to any foreigner or foreign Power without the sanction of His Majesty’s Government; he is bound to suppress slave traffic and to prohibit traffic in arms within his territories ; and he has agreed not to give a concession for oil, or for pearl fishing, without the approval of His Majesty’s Government. 3. The internal administration is conducted by the Sheikh, assisted in theory by an elected Council of Advisers (two from the Subah or reigning family, four from the inhabitants, elected for one year), acceptance of which was made for the first time a condition of recognition by the people of Koweit on the accession of the present Sheikh.')* The Council, though duly elected, has, however, never met.J 4. His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India are represented by the Political Agent (at present Major J. C. More, D.S.O.), an appointment created in 1904, maintained since that date save for a brief interval in 1905, and borne on the cadre of the Indian Political Department. The Political Agent is directly subordinate to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. He does not hold His Majesty’s Commission as a Consul or exercise Consular functions. Under the Koweit Order in Council of 1925 (see paras. 24-27 below), he is the District Magistrate and Sessions Judge, and exercises his powers subject to the jurisdiction of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; the limits of his jurisdiction are the territories and territorial waters of Koweit, and he exercises jurisdiction inter alios over British subjects and protected persons, and over the subjects and protected persons (not. being subjects or protected persons of Muslim Governments) of Foreign States in respect of whom the Foreign States concerned may agree to the exercise of such jurisdiction. 5. The effect of the recommendations of the Masterton-Smith Committee of 1921 was to leave control of the internal administration and affairs of Koweit to the Government of India (to whom, and not to His Majesty’s Government, the Political Resident in the Gulf was instructed in 1924 to look for orders regarding them), subject to the general control of His Majesty’s Government, and to the prior concurrence of the Colonial Office in matters of political significance. Questions of policy, especially questions affecting relations with Ibn Sand, fell to be dealt with by the Colonial Office. The question of the channels through which the instructions of His Majesty’s Government are to issue on matters affecting the Principality is dealt with in para. 5 of the Note on Political Control in the Persian Gulf on page 6. Expenditure on Koweit is divided between His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India. In the latest year for which figures are available (1926-7) it amounted to Rs. 45,683, plus payments in respect of pension contribution amounting to Rs. 9,423, a total of Rs. 55,106. 2979c 75 10.28 C.O. to H.C., Iraq.

At the time when that memorandum was composed and until the beginning of the War, Koweit was of vital interest to Gr^ Britain in connection with the Baghdad Railway, and during the period 1908-14 I lis Majesty’s Government, in their relations with the Sheikh, had primarily in view the consolidation of their position and influence in Koweit in the face of the efforts of Germany to establish herself at the head of the Gulf. 8. The vexed question of the rights of the Sheikh of Koweit over the islands of Bubiyan and Warba, dealt with in the Foreign Office Memorandum, was carefully investigated by the local authorities and the Government of India in 1907-9. The conclusions which emerged were that enquiry had gone far to establish the claims of the Sheikh to the ownership of Bubiyan, but that no satisfactory evidence had been produced as to his claims to Warba ; and in the circumstances His Majesty’s Government decided that it was inadvisable to raise any question of the rights of the Sheikh to either island. (Both islands were recognised as falling within the dominions of the Sheikh of Koweit by the Anglo-Turkish Agreement of 29th July 1913.) 9. Between 1909 and 1911 the attitude of the Turkish authorities in the Basra Vilayet, who placed difficulties in the way of the registration of property acquired in their jurisdiction by the Sheikh unless His Excellency would consent to describe himself as a Turkish subject—an attitude which inevitably raised the wider question of the status of Koweit, gave rise to considerable correspondence, in the course of which His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople was instructed to make clear the views on that matter of His Majesty’s (government. Circumstances, however, intervened to make an immediate demarche by Sir G. Lowther from time to time unnecessary or undesirable, and ihe question merged in the general Anglo-Turkish negotiations initiated in 1911. 10. The Sheikh undertook in 1911 not to grant a pearl fishing concession to foreigners save with the prior approval of His Majesty’s Government, and gave a similar undertaking as regards oil in 1913. Subsequent developments as regards oil concessions are dealt with in para. 29 below. With the assistance of a loan of £12,500 from the Government of India, arrangements were made in 1914 for the installation by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, on behalf of the Sheikh, of a water distilling plant, which was not, however, brought into operation until 1919.° 11. The question of Koweit played an important part in the Anglo Jurkisli negotiations of 1911-14. An agreement was reached, and a Convention, to. give effect to it, signed on 29th July 1913. Under this agreement, in the terms of which the concurrence of the Sheikh had been secured, the territory of Koweit was recognised as an autonomous caza of the Ottoman Empire; the Ottoman flag was to be flown by the Sheikh, but he was to have the right to insert a distinctive emblem in the corner'; he was to continue to be a Turkish Kaimakam, and his successors were to be appointed to a similar position by the Ottoman Government; the full administrative autonomy of the Sheikh was recognised within the territories of Koweit proper, the limits of which were defined by the red circle on Map Xo. II appended to this Memorandum ; within a surrounding area (included within a green line on the map) which was occupied by tribes recognised as dependent on him, he was, as in the past, to continue to levy tribute and to perform the administrative duties of Turkish Kaimakam; in both regions Turkey undertook to abstain entirely from any interference , though the right to appoint a Commissioner at Koweit “to protect the interests and subjects of other parts of the Empire ” was secured toiler' existing agreements between the Sheikh and His Majesty’s Government including the Secret Agreement of 1899, were recognised 'by the Ottoman Government, and I lis Majesty’s Government engaged that so long as no change was made in the statu* quo as now defined, they would not alter the■ Tel. from Pol. lies, to G nature of British relations with the Government of Koweit or establish a Protectorate there. A subsidiary article (9) secured to the Sheikh the enjoyment of his private property in the Basra Vilayet. 12. The outbreak of war in August 1914 prevented the final ratification the Anglo-Turkish Agreement the substance of which is summarised a Dove, and the entry of Turkey into the War in November 1.914 against the Allies produced a completely new situation. The Sheikh, who had been informed officially on 8th August 1914 of the outbreak of war between Great Britain and Germany, on 21st August made a declaration of loyalty to His Majesty’s Government on behalf of himself and his tribes,* placed “his efforts, his men, and his shipsat the disposal of Great Britain, and p. iel'. from g.’ of expressed a desire to eject the Turkish garrison from the islands at the i-to Pol.

(2) You are guaranteed by the Great British Government against all consequences of your attack against Safwan, Umm Kasr and Bubiyan. (3) Koweit shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection. 13. In February 1915 sanction was given to the transfer to Koweit of the Admiralty coaling depot at Bushire^ a step originally recommended by the Government of India in 1910, and approved in 1912 by the Foreign Office, Admiralty and India Office, the taking of which had however hitherto been postponed in view of the possibility that it might prejudicially react on the Anglo-Turkish negotiations. But on the recommendations of the Naval authorities it was agreed in 1910 that the proposal should be dropped until the conclusion of the War. It was decided in 1920 that the transfer should not take place. X Tel. from S. of S. to G. of I„ Feb. 2 1915, P. 385/16; G. of I. Dosp.. June 9 1910, P. 904/10; tel. from S. of S. to Viceroy.

Koweit since his assassination of his brother in 1896, and who had consistently co-operated actively with His Majesty’s Government, died on 28th November 1915, and was succeeded by his eldest son, Sheikh Jabir, who was informed in March 1916 by the Viceroy that “ so long as you act Kharita, Fob. 2 1916 , from up to existing arrangements with the British Government you mav'expect Vicero ? to Sheikh, the same support as was enjoyed by your father.” * ' 23 2 ‘ m ' 16. In the earlier part of 1915 Koweit had been brought in intimate contact with the affairs of Ibn Sand on the revolt of the Ajman tribe against the latter. The Ajman were finally routed in September, and forced to take refuge in Koweit territory, in which they remained until the death of Mubarak, immediately on which Ibn Sand' pressed his successor, Sheikh Jabir, to expel the Ajman Sheikhs, a demand to which Jabir, reluctant to eject the Ajman lest they should be driven into the enemy camp, but unable to hold out against Ibn Sand’s pre?sure without creating an open breach finally yielded in February 1916.

Relations between Ibn Saud and Koweit had for some years before the death of Mubarak been growing cooler. Ibn Saud had latterly resented what he regarded as the equivocal attitude of the Sheikh during the negotiations between the Ottoman Government and himself in the spring of 1914; the asylum given to the Ajman was a further grievance,§ and^the §p 49 o&lt;i / i 6 incidence of the transit dues levied from time immemorial in Koweit formed the subject of a complaint by the ruler of Nejd in 1916.

Darbar held at Koweit on 20th November 1916, and attended b} T Ibn Sand, the Sheikh of Mohammerah, Sheikh Jabir of Koweit and Sir Percy ( 1 ox, for the purpose of investing the Sheikh of Koweit with the C.S.I., the three chiefs swore together to work with His Majesty’s Government for the achievement of a common end.^J 18. On the death on 5th February 1917, of Sheikh Jabir “in wliq^p weak hands ” to quote the Political Agent,• :f Government in Koweit “ had almost collapsed,” His Majesty’s Government approved the recognition as successor of his brother Sheikh Salim, to whom an assurance similar to that granted to his predecessor and quoted above was conveyed by tiie \ iceroy in March 1917. The new Sheikh was a man of very different calibre from Sheikh Jabir. Narrow in outlook, bigoted in religious matters, tactless in his personal relations, his marked individuality and strength of purpose none the less made it possible for the Political Agent to report in the spring of 1918 that he had “ established himself in a brief space of time verv securely in the Sheikhdom.” But the qualities which helped him to assert himself locally shortly set him at odds with both His Majesty’s Government and Ibn Sand. 19. Difficulty arose with the latter over the Ajman tribe, whom Salim allowed in October 1917 to return to Koweit, and over the respective rights of Ibn Sand and the Sheikh to levy tribute on the Awazim tribe, and formed the subject of vigorous complaint by Ibn Sand at the end of 1917. In July 1918, Mr. Philby represented that Ajman activities based on Koweit territory were causing widespread resentment in Nejd and leading to remonstrance from Ibn Sand as to the inadequacy of our support. Measures to meet this grievance—the location of a mobile column in Koweit territory, the stationing of a British post at Safwan Wells, the occupation of Koweit itself—were under exami nation when, in September 1918, Lord Allenby’s victories in Palestine made the removal of the blockade possible and temporarily eased the situation, and no action was taken beyond warning the leading Sheiks that if raids continued their subsidies would cease. 20. Difficulty with His Majesty’s Government arose over the strict main tenance in Koweit territories and ports of the blockade imposed in (?) 1915|| with a view to preventing the leakage of supplies to the enemy, whether in Mesopotamia or in the isolated Turkish garrisons at Medina and elsewhere in the Arabian peninsula—a blockade, not unnaturally unpopular with Koweit merchants, the strictness of which was relaxed by Salim. The Sheikh subsequently adopted an attitude so obstructive in the matter that, after prolonged consideration, it was found necessary to warn him through the Political Resident, on 5th duly .1918, that the assurances conveyed to him on his accession were conditional on his good behaviour, and that, should acts “ contrary to the interests of (His Majesty’s) Government ” “ unfortunately be committed in future,” he would be held personally responsible.! The hint was not wasted ; the Sheikh for the remainder of the war maintained a less unsatisfactory attitude towards His Majesty’s Government,! and his co-operation in the matter of the blockade was recognised at the end of 191.8 by the grant of the C.S.I. and of a lump sum of 3 lakhs of rupees, and by the cancellation of the claim of the Government of India in respect of the loan of £12,500 made in connection with the Koweit water supply in 1914§ (see para. 10 above). 21. On the conclusion of the war llis Excellency despatched his nephew, the present Sheikh, to offer his congratulations to the King on its successful outcome, and there has been no friction of importance since then with His Majesty’s Government. (2).—1919-28. 22. The termination of the war necessitated a decision as to the status of Koweit, which His Majesty’s Government had promised in November 1914 to recognise as an independent principality under British protection. The declaration of a British protectorate over the State, as over Bahrein, &amp;c., which was mooted by the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, met with no support from the Government of India, who took exception to it || It has not been possible to ascertain the precise date.as likely to rouse suspicion in the neighbouring Arab peoples, to provoke the jealousy of other Powers, and to involve His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India in heavy obligations, both military and financial. Their view was accepted by the Secretary of State for India; the proposal was dropped and matters continued to rest on the declaration 1914 quoted in para. 12 above. On the general question of status being specifically raised in connection with the preparation of a Koweit Order in Council, the Foreign Office in July 1921 expressed the view that, from the legal standpoint and on the understanding that there was no intention of including Koweit within the boundaries of Mesopotamia, “ the status of this territory would appear to be governed by Article 132 of the Treaty of Sevres.” It was subsequently agreed that a final decision on the question of status must await the signature of the Treaty of Peace with Turkey, and, the Treaty of Lausanne having been signed in the autumn of 1923, steps were taken to introduce an Order in Council providing for British jurisdiction within the territory of the Sheikh. That territory, as stated in para. 2 above, may now be regarded as an independent Arab State under British protection, but not a British protectorate. 23. The questions of most importance which have arisen in Koweit since the conclusion of the War are the following:— A. Internal:— (1) Koweit Order in Council providing for British jurisdiction within the Principality. (2) Termination of the lease of Bunder Shweikh. B. External:— (1) Relations with Ibn Saw] — (a) Koweit-Nejd-Iraq boundary question ; (b) Koweit-Nejd Customs question ; (c) The Akhwan menace. (2) Relations with Iraq — (a) Exemption from taxation of date gardens in Iraq of the Sheikh of Koweit; (b) Position of Koweit vis-d-vis Iraq. (3) Relations with Persia. Internal Questions, 1919-28. (a) The Koweit Order in Council. 24. The question of extending the scope of the “ Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council, 1907,” had been under consideration before the War, but no decision had been reached upon it, the difficulty in respect of Koweit having principally been the undesirability of taking action before a settlement should have been arrived at with Turkey in regard to the Arab Littoral. In December 1919 the Civil Commissioner at Baghdad again raised 0 the question of passing a jurisdictional Order in Council for Koweit. The India Office expressed the opinion, however,! that, although the Order was desirable in itself and though there would be advantage in issuing it at an early date, it was desirable to postpone action until a decision had been taken on the machinery for the administration of the Mesopotamian Mandate and the effect of the Mandate upon the relations of His Majesty’s Government with contiguous countries. This view was accepted by the Foreign Office! and the matter was allowed to rest for a year. 25. The question was again raised in the summer of 1921 by the High Commissioner in Iraq, who recommended (a view in which the Government of India concurred)^ that the promulgation of an Order in Council need not be further delayed now that Turkey was recognised as having lost suzerainty over the Principality. The matter was referred to the Colonial Office who, under the recommendations of the Masterton-Smith Committee, had become responsible for policy on the Arab Littoral of the Persian Gulf. On reference to the Foreign Office they were informed that, from the legal point of view and on the supposition that there was no intention of including Koweit within the boundaries of Mesopotamia, the status of that territory would seem to be governed by Article 132 of the Treaty of Sevres under which Letter from F.O. to I .O., July 25 1921, P. 3495. * Letter from C.C. to G. of I., Dec. 22, 1919, P.697/20, t 1.0. letter to F.O..

Turkey renounced iu favour of the principal Allied Powers all rights and title over territories outside Europe not otherwise disposed of by the Treaty ; that, in practice, provided some prior agreement were reached with the Sheikh of Koweit, it would appear unlikely that any Foreign Powers would challenge the issue of an Order in Council on the lines of the Bahrein Order in Council of 1913 (although the extension of British jurisdiction, as in tl^ order, to foreigners might involve the prior concurrence of some Foreign Powers), but that, while the High Commissioner in Iraq might be authorised to open negotiations with the Sheikh with a view to ascertaining the measure of British supervision which His Excellency was prepared to accept, the actual issue of an Order in Council consolidating any agreement that might be reached with the Sheikh should be postponed until the coming into force of the Treaty of Peace with Turkey. 2G. No further action was taken until the Treaty of Lausanne had been signed and, owing to the necessity for departmental examination of the provisions of the Order, the approval of His Majesty to an Order in. Council was not finally obtained until 17th March 1925. Under the Order in question jurisdiction over British subjects and protected persons, the subjects and protected persons of non-Moslem foreign Governments, and Koweit subjects or the subjects of other Moslem Governments registered in the Office of the Political Agent as being regularly employed by British subjects or subjects of non-Moslem foreign Governments, was vested in the Political Agent subject to the general control of, and a right of appeal to, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. It may be noted 0 that, no- foreign Power having consented to the exercise of jurisdiction over its nationals in Koweit by His Majesty, the Political Agent was instructed, at the request of the Foreign Office, that, in the event of a national of a non- Moslem Power committing some crime or misdemeanour necessitating proceedings against him, or of such a person becoming involved in civil proceedings, the matter should at once be brought to the notice of His Majesty’s Government who, on learning that such a case had arisen, would take steps to ascertain from the Government of the person concerned whether they desired that the case should be dealt with under the Koweit Order in Council. The Order in Council came into force in the 1st October ] 92o,f but the concurrence of the Sheikh in the delegation of jurisdiction over the classes of person in question was not finally obtained until November 1925.f Since that date various Rules of Court and King’s Regulations have been issued under the Koweit Order in Council, but no point of importance has arisen in connection with its operation. 27. It may be recorded that, a clearer understanding as to responsibility, as between the interested Departments of His Majesty’s Government, for the internal administration of Koweit having been reached by that stage, the preparation and issue of the Order in Council of 1925 were, by agreement with the Colonial Office, left to be dealt with by the India Office in conjunction with the Foreign Office. (b) The Bunder Shweikh Lease. 28. The question of terminating the lease of Bunder Shweikh, the earlier history of which is given in the Foreign Office Memorandum of 1908, and the engagements entered into in connection with which by His Majesty’s Government are shown in the Precis of Treaties appended to the present Memorandum, came up for consideration on the conclusion of the War. After considerable correspondence during 1919-20, the Government of India recommended in April 1920 that the lease should be terminated as the Sheikh had maintained a consistently obstructive attitude towards His Majestv’s Government. Uncertainty as to the status of Koweit. under the Peace Treaty, and consideration of the political effect on the Sheikh of withdrawal of the subsidy which the rent of Bunder Shweikh in fact constituted, of the possibility of bringing pressure to bear on His Excellency in other ways, and of the question of retaining the site at a reduced rent, &amp;c., prevented a decision before the death of Sheikh Salim in February 1921. His Majesty’s Government subsequently decided in consultation with the Government of India to terminate the lease of the Bunder Shweikh lands, while agreeing,j mmmm. ,as they had no present use tor the wireless buildings erected on those lands d ««p- from h.c., Iraq, t« to the use of the buildings in question by the Sheikh of Kovveit as a 2 1922 ' q laiantine station for the town. The High Commissioner for Iraq reported i A gu ™ t^at this decision had been communicated to and accepted Jjv the Sheikh. There have been no further echoes of this question since at date. It should be noted, however, that while the lease has been teimmated, the Agreement does not appear to have been abrogated, and that the reciprocal pledges exchanged on its conclusion in 1907 presumably therefore, remain binding in so far as they are not affected by other subsequent instruments. Oil in Koweit. 29. In concluding the review of the more important post-war internal developments m Koweit, reference may conveniently be made to the question of oil. Jhe Sheikh had agreed in 1913 (see para. 10 above) not to grant an oil concession without the approval of His Majesty’s Government. Ileie as in Bahrem the question of obtaining a concession was revived by the Anglo -1 ersian Oil Company in 1921, and His Majesty’s Government who were anxious to facilitate the establishment by the Company of control’ over the oil resources of the north Arabian coast, agreed to the institution of negotiations which were conducted through the Political Resident in the rersian Gulf. Lengthy negotiations have, however, so far proved unfruitful. (1 lie general question of oil in the Gulf is dealt with in the Board of Trade -Memorandum on page JJ-) External Questions, 1919-28. (1) Relations with Ibn Saud. (a) Koweit-Nejd-Iraq Boundary Question. 9Qt , 30 ; , 0 'V'g to “j 6 non-ratification of the Anglo-Turkish Convention of r .)th .Inly 1913, the boundaries of Koweit had, as explained above been left m suspense on the outbreak of the War. Clause 6 of the Treaty concluded with Ibn baud, on the 20th December 1915, provided that the limits of Koweit territory should thereafter be determined. The question remained in a mud state until the end of the War. o\ In January 1919, on Sheikh Salim proposing to build a fort at Major More’*, Memo Dauhat balbul, just north of Jabal Mamfa, Ibn Sand took exception claimino- p - 2 - 417 / 28 . that the site in question lay within his territory. No overt act followed but relations on tins subject became increasingly strained, customs difficulties— the feheikh having placed an embargo on exports to Ibn Sand’s ports*- * Letter w ibn Sand to Iuither aggravating the situation. Matters culminated in the surorise and Sheikh Salim, ju»e 21 1020 deleat by Akhwan under Faisal-ai-Dawish of the Koweit tribesmen under P ~ Sheikh Dhaij who had been sent by Sheikh Salim to contest Akhwan •occupancy of Jariyab, at Hamdeh, near Janyah, on the 18th April 1920 , from p. 6317/20 which point the friction between the Sheikh of Koweit and Ibn Sand became acute. 1 he situation was briefly,! that the Sheikh claimed on his southern + c*&gt;.teLfrom c.c„ frontier the boundaries represented by the green line in the map attached to f^Au^ni ^ 1 ‘’ draft Anglo-Purkish Convention, which repreBented the area administered by p- 6281 / 20 . ’ ' ’ - a ! hei :&gt; ^eikh Mubarak, over the whole of which, however, by August 1920 he had no longer effective control. Ibn Sand, on the other hand ■claimed the southern portion of the area in question by virtue of the fact that the tribes ordinarily resident therein had since 1914 or thereabouts been under his direct control, and not under that of Sheikh Salim or his predecessor, feheikn Jubir. 9 O During the summer of 1920, His Majesty’s Government, with a view to determining the dispute, on which they had been approached by both parties* authorised Sir Percy Cox, then High Commissioner in Iraq, to discuss the matter with Ibn Saud and the Sheikh of Koweit. Ibn Sand formally claimedg the whole country up to the walls of Koweit “as in the time of Colonel lelly, and maintained that he had no cognisance of the boundaries of Koweit agreed between us and the Turks in 1913 and that such an agreement could not in any case he operative against him,’especially ns he had himself recovered the El Hasa province from Turkey before the t Tel. from I’.A..

Sheikh Salim, on the other hand, claimed to take advantage of the frontier agreed upon between Turkey and His Majesty’s Government, as embodied in the draft Auglo-Turkish Convention. Sir P. Cox, having heard both sides and formed his own conclusions, recommended that a meeting should be arranged during the winter of 1920 between the principals wW* a view to settlement. At this stage Sheikh Salim (who, like Ibn Sand, \u.j. given an undertaking in writing to refrain from aggression pending the settlement of the issues by the mediation of His Majesty’s Government), having failed to demobilise a considerable force which he had gathered together at Jahra, at the head of Koweit Bay, was attacked by the Akhwan and an inconclusive if bloody fight ensued (October 1920). 33. Thanks to the good offices of the High Commissioner, it proved possible to avoid further hostilities, and negotiations continued until the early part of 1921. In December 1920 Ibn Sand, who in November|| had been invited to visit Basra with a view to reaching a settlement under the auspices of His Majesty’s Government, expressed his willing ness to accept the ex parte decision of the High Commissioner, but stated that he was unable to go to Basra owing partly to ill-health, and partly to internal political difficulties. In January 1921, no settlement having yet been reached, the Sheikh of Mohammerah offered to send his son Sheikh Chasib, accompanied by Sheikh Ahmed el Jabir, nephew and heir presumptive of the Sheikh of Koweit, to Nejd^f to endeavour to arrange a truce between Ibn Sand and Sheikh Salim, llis offer was accepted and the mission left for Bahrein en route for Nejd in February, reaching Ibn Sand’s camp to the north of Riyadh on the 2nd March. On the 4th March the news of the death of Sheikh Salim arrived, whereupon Ibn Sand stated that there was no longer any quarrel to settle or any need for a frontier between his territories and those of the Sheikh of Koweit 0 —an arrangement with which Sheikh Ahmed (whose succession was recognised by His Majesty’s Government, who renewed to him the assurances given to Sheikh Salimt), was reported at the time to be quite satisfied. (Ibn Saud had already been informed^ before the death of Sheikh Salim, that His Majesty’s Government recognised the territory within the inner boundary (the red circle) shown on the map attached to the Anglo-Turkish Agreement as definitely appertaining to Koweit and not open to dispute). 34. No further developments took place until November 1922, when at the Conference held at Ojair from 27th November to 3rd December between Sir Percy Cox and Ibn Saud (the Political Agent, Koweit, also being present) the Koweit-Nejd frontier came up for consideration. It was recognised at once that the power of the Sheikh of Koweit in the desert was much less than it had been at the time of the conclusion of the Anglo-Turkish Agreement of 1913, and a settlement was finally reached under which the frontier as between Nejd and Koweit starts from the junction of the Wadi al Aujah with the Batin on the west; running thence (leaving Riqai to Nejd) in a straight line to the junction of the 29th parallel of latitude with the red semicircle on the map attached to the draft Anglo-Turkish agreement, and reproduced in Map II appended to this Memorandum ; thence following the red semicircle to the sea south of Ras al Qulaiah. The southern boundary of the recognised territory of Koweit was defined as above. It was simultaneously agreed that the tract of country bounded on the north by the above line, on the west by the Shaqq, on the east by the sea r and on the south by a straight line running eastward from the Shaqq in the west through Ain al Abd to the sea north of Ras al Mishab, should be recognised as common to the two States of Nejd and Koweit, who were to i K c ) 22 t ' i p' 1 n! ar i 95 °r/S enjoy equal rights in it until such time as a fresh agreement should be arrived at between them regarding it through the good offices of His Majesty’s Government. This frontier, which had been negotiated on behalf of the Sheikh (Major More, the Political Agent at Koweit, representing his interests), was accepted by His Excellency on the 26th January 1923. Letter from H.C., Iraq, to P.A., Koweit, April 19 1923, P. 17-5 23. 35. In April 1923 the Sheikh was informed that His Majesty’s Government recognised the frontier claimed by him as between Koweit and Iraq and the attribution to Koweit of the Islands of Warba, Bubiyan, Maskan, Failakah,.9 Aulia!), Rub bar, Qaru, and (jimn-el-Maradin—in other words, the frontier indicated by the green line of the Anglo-Ttirkish Agreement of 29th July id].). 1 he frontiers of Koweit are accordingly as shown on Map II attached to the present Memorandum. Since 1923 no difficulty has arisen in regard to them. (6) Customs dispute between Ibn Saud and the Sheikh of Koweit. 36. The difficulty is not a new one; it dates from before the war With the acquisition of El Hasa by Ibn Saud in 1913, Nejd acquired a sea front, but the sea front in question contained no port of any real value and the P. 1276 / 24 , eitoits made from time to time by Ibn Saud, with the assistance at intervals o! His Majesty s Government, to secure that steamship lines such as the Imtish Indian Steam Navigation Company should call at Ojair or at Oatif oi to develop Ojair, Qatif or Jubail, have proved abortive. In these! circumstances a friendly understanding with the Sheikhs of Bahrein and Koweit on the question of customs and transit dues is of great and evident importance to the Ruler of Nejd. Agreement with Bahrein, on the basis ol a transit duty of 2 per cent., was reached in 1920, after long discussion and much ill-feeling, with the assistance of the Government of India Agreement with Koweit, which in 1923 levied a 4 per cent, duty on imports ino f 7 , 1 f 61 ' Cent * transit dllt &gt;3 has not .Y et been reached ; and since P- 2999 / 2 : 1 . Ibn baud has 111 consequence maintained an embargo on trade with Roweit with the result that the prosperity of the Principality, as indeed of KJasim and Hail 111 Nejd, lias been seriously affected. 37. The position is briefly that Ibn Saud, on the ground that it is impossible to collect import duty on the desert frontier between Kuwait and -Nejd, ts anxious for the establishment either of a Nejdi Custom House in Aoweil town or of an arrangement under which export duty only should be CO ected on his behalf at Koweit, a fixed sum being paid to Nejd instead of rr, |' ' t - V '- v A th,rd P ro P&lt; &gt;sal * made in 19.’3 by the Sheikh's cousin AIxjuI laleas-ba!im was that the embargo should be raised on terms which wouhl have involved the payment to Ibn Saud, through an Agent and Collector stationed m Aoweit (Abdullah-as-Salim himself), of the whole of the customs dues 011 goods exported from Koweit by land other than those destined lor the Sheikh’s own subjects or for Iraq.f 38. I he objection of the Sheikh of Koweit to an agreement on the lines referred to above would appear to be due as much to the fear of allowing )ii baud to establish a stranglehold over Koweit as to anxiety to secure an aiiangement which shall not be economically unsatisfactory from bis own point of view. An arrangement which would enable Ibn Saud to collect his own dues m KoweU would, as the Government of India pointed out in December U-o appear prund jade to contravene both Ibn Sand’s engagements to His Majesty s Government, and those into which His Majesty’s Government have themselves entered with Koweit; while the extension in vowed of the influence of the King of the Hejaz and Nejd would in any event be objectionable-the engagements to Koweit of His Mai’esty’s Government apart—on general political grounds * Cp. Major More’s Memo, s.v. Abdullah-as-Salim. + June-July 1922, P. 3476/23. 39. I here has been no development of importance in recent years, though the position cannot be satisfactory from the point of view of either Koweit or Nejd A settlement which would be fair to both parties and unobjectionable lorn the standpoint of His Majesty s Government could best be reached on N fr the lines suggested in July 1923 by the then Political Resident in the 1 ersmn Gu t, which were accepted at the time by the Colonial Office and the India Office (. olonel Knox s recommendation was that steps should he taken to obtain the agreement of Ibn Saud and the Sheikh of Koweit firstly to the appointment of a Customs expert, preferably from India, to advise oil the reform of the Koweit Customs and on the shares of the Customs revenue to be apportioned to Nejd and Koweit respectively, and, secondly, to the appointment for five years ol an official to serve under the control of the loll.

The Akhwan raids on Iraq by keisal-al-Dawish and the Mutair tribe at the end of 1927 had, however, more important reactions on the Principality.§ At the request of the Sheikh His Majesty’s Government agreed to aerial reconnaissance over his territory; and, with his concurrence, it was later decided to withdraw the restrictions originally imposed by His Majesty’s Government on bombing in pursuit of raiders within Koweit territory. An Akhwan raid was successfully dealt with by Koweit forces at El Hiqai on 27th January 1928, | and whilst retiring into Nejd was pursued and successfully attacked by the Royal Air Force on two following days. A further raid occurred late in February, which was not opposed by ground forces, but was again successfully pursued by the Royal Air Force for two days. In view of the possibility of further serious developments, and of the recognised liability of His Majesty’s Govern ment under existing engagements for the “protection of Koweit” (a phrase the exact scope of which is open to argument^), further defence measures were now taken. A temporary air base (political objections to a permanent station being regarded as conclusive, cp. para. 47 below), was established in Koweit: a flight of aeroplanes and a detachment of armoured cars were despatched to the town for its protection : three vessels of the Persian Gulf squadron (later reduced to one) were stationed off Koweit itself, and a landing party disembarked and remained on shore until the crisis had passed. All action taken was taken with the concurrence of the Sheikh, who was, in addition, allowed to purchase from the Government of India a small supply of machine guns and Lewis guns. After some discussion His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India agreed that His Excellency might be allowed to purchase armoured motor cars, on the understanding that they would be used only for defence, and would not cross the borders of Koweit in repelling raids save with the concurrence of the Political Agent. The crisis, however, passed off without incident, and the special forces which had been despatched to Koweit were withdrawn during the late spring. For financial reasons the Sheikh abandoned the idea of purchasing armoured cars.** 41. Consequent on the breakdown of the negotiations with I bn Sand in the summer of 1928. and the possible danger of a revival of Akhwan activity on the Traq-Nejd border, the question of granting discretion to the Air Officer Commanding, Iraq, to carry out reconnaissances by air or car over Koweit territory was raised by the Air Ministry. 42. The “ very obvious and grave political objection ” to air recon naissance over Koweit was emphasised by Sir Gilbert Clayton. After considerable discussion between the Departments concerned, the Air Officer Commanding was finally authorised to carry out occasional reconnaissances both by air and car, at his discretion, on the understanding that the concurrence of the Sheikh should be obtained, through the Political Resident; that reconnaissance should be carried out as infrequently and in as unprovocative a manner as possible; that the Sheikh should be given “no grounds for supposing that the Royal Air Force have assumed responsibility for the defence of Koweit or that he himself has been relieved of his obligations in this respect ”; that save in case of real emergency reconnaissance should not be carried out within 25 miles of the Nejd-Koweit frontier nor in the immediate vicinity of the Nejd-IraqH i « * Desp. to C.O., 14, April 1928 P. 2696/28.

No information is available as to any subsequent developments. (2) Position of Koweit vis-d-vis Iraq. 4b. Under the engagement of 1914 between His Majesty s Government and the Sheikh of Koweit, the Principality of Koweit is recognised as an independent Principality and as entitled to the protection of His Majesty s Government, by whom, as stated in para. 35 above, the present Koweit-fiaq boundary was recognised in 1923. formally, therefoie, there is no question of its absorption by Iraq. r l he Political Resident in the Persian Gulf has, however, recently drawn attention (as the result of an incident in which an Iraq officer was alleged to have despatched an Iiuq police inspector to Koweit to arrest and bring back an offender fiom theie) to the danger of Koweit and Iraq becoming, in the minds of the native community, unified under British protection. Sir Lionel Haworth icmaiked that “ it must be an essential part of our policy that Koweit should be kept apart from Iraq—it is inevitable that it should be the tendency ol Iiaq gradually to assimilate .Koweit even if there is no conscious knouledge of the fact among the officials of the Iraq Government. Such tendencies result, not from direct action, but from psychological factors, from the dependence of the Sheikh of Koweit upon Iraq for assistance, from the appointment of Iraq officers to Koweit during the raids, and from the common interests of people, alike in race and religion, depending upon the same market centres and in constant daily communication. It is, indeed, perhaps the natural development that Koweit should draw close to Iraq while we are there, but we do not desire her to get so close that, with the development of time, she would be left there when we leave in spite of our wishes . . . It is for us to see . . . that such help as Koweit may require may be obtained from assistance from our Navy and the training of her people—and it would be better that such training should be given from India and not from Iraq. Koweit should be trained to look to His Majesty’s Government and India alone and not to a country under our Mandate. 47. The Political Resident had earlier in 1923 urged the undesirability from the point of view alike of the immediate situation and of our* future policy of linking Iraq and Koweit in the mind of Ibn Sand by establishing an air base against Akhwan raiders in Koweit territory. He reiterated his objections in connection with the proposals dealt with in paras. 40 and 41 above. On both occasions the Government of India expressed their general agreement in the view taken by him. (3) Relations with Persia. 48. No question affecting the relations between Koweit and Persia appears to have arisen in the period now under consideration, and it would be unnecessary to refer to the relationship between the two countries were it not for the information which has recently been received that a Persian instruction has been issued to the local Persian officials in the Gulf that the Persian Government can recognise no Arab rulers on the Arab coast of the Gulf, and that all persons belonging to and arriving from Koweit (as fro Muscat, Bahrein and the Trucial Sheikhdoms) are to be considered Persia subjects, and Persian passports to be issued to them. 49. It is impossible at the present stage to estimate the importance to be attached to the information quoted above. It may, however, be placed on record that no evidence has been traced of effective exercise in the past of Persian authority in Koweit. The tw’O incidents on which a Persian claim might possibly be based are—first, that Koweit was regarded in 1775 as a dependency of Basra, and that a claim might therefore be put forward in view of the fact that Persia had occupied that town from 1775 to 1779, even though Persian authority does not appear in the same period to have extended to Koweit. The second and more important incident is that of 1899. In om si an13 October of that year it was ascertained that the Sheikh of Koweit had undoubtedly applied through the Sheikh of Mohamtnerah to be taken under Persian protection. Mr. Lorimer suggests that this move, which the Sheikh, it is stated, took no pains to conceal, was perhaps contrived by His Excellency m&amp;rely with a view to testing the degree of interest taken in Koweit by His MBbsty’s Government. The Sheikh’s advances were, however, in any case rejected by the Shah. C.—Summary. 50. In conclusion, it may be remarked that, while the present Sheikh is far from an outstanding personality, internal conditions in Koweit at the present time show a marked improvement on the position on the death of Sheikh Salim in 1921. In August 1920f local feeling was reported to be + Tel. from c.c. to s. of s. running high against Sheikh Salim, owing to the loss of trade resulting from Au *‘ 29 1920 » his quarrel with Ibn Sand, to his general incapacity as a ruler and to his total lack of tact, and it would appear that a coup d'etat was more than a possibility:]: had not the Sheikh died at a critical period of the Koweit-Nejd j Cp. tel. from n.c., boundary negotiations on 23rd February 1921. Under the present Sheikh, j^ h i S p° 692 m L ' while the customs dispute with Nejd remains an open sore and the activity Major More’s Report : of the Akhwan a standing menace, matters may on the whole, be said quite AbduiiarTaT definitely to have improved. The boundary question has been settled and ‘ H ' a 1 ' a8 “ a ” ar ' on a basis not unsatisfactory from the point of view of Koweit; the question of British jurisdiction within the Principality has equally been regularised; internal conditions are not such as to call for serious animadversion and, while the Sheikh, as stated above, is not an outstanding personality, he is not only well disposed towards His Majesty’s Government but, from the point of view of internal administration, may be regarded as a not inefficient ruler Ma j or More &gt; s Report, when judged by Arab standards. passim. 51. On a broad view, the importance of Koweit is less great from the standpoint of His Majesty’s Government than that of Bahrein or of Muscat; but its absorption, or the establishment in it of a dominating influence, by Ibn Sand, could not but react injuriously on the position of His Majesty’s Government alike in Iraq and in Bahrein and along the Trucial Coast. Hitherto it has been possible to maintain British influence without substantial interference in the internal affairs of the Principality ; the recent activities of the Akhwan have led to formal appeals by the Sheikh to the guarantees of protection which he holds from His Majesty’s Government, and it is to be hoped that the standing threat to his independence constituted by his powerful neighbour in Nejd and the effective assistance given him against the Akhwan during the present year may help to continue to keep him generally amenable to British influence. The desirability, at the same time, of securing that the Sheikh shall not escape absorption by Ibn Sand only to end by absorption in an Iraq, no longer under British mandate, and the increased importance which his Principality, situated at the head of the Gulf, will assume as British control decreases in Iraq, cannot be overlooked in considering the general policy to be adopted in the Principality by His Majesty’s Government. D.—Points referred to Persian Gulf Sub-Committee. 52. The points in connection with Koweit which have been specifically mentioned in connection with the deliberations of the Persian Gulf Sub- Oommittee are :— (a) Whether the maintenance of the independence of Koweit (as of Muscat and the Trucial Chiefs) which is constantly threatened by Ibn Sand, is necessary for British purposes, and, if so, how is it to be secured ? (P.G. 3 viii, P.G. 0 (2) c. i.) (A) The position as between Iraq and Koweit—desirability of keeping Koweit clear from absorption in Iraq, or from coming under Iraq influence. (P.G. 0, 2 {b) (3).) (c) Extent to which His Majesty’s Government should increase or decrease the interest taken and the control exercised by them in Koweit.

In this connection the Government of India have expressed the view that the maintenance of the independence of Kovveit (as of Muscat, Bahrein, and the Trucial Chiefs) is necessary in British interests ; that the veiled protectorate at present exercised over them by His Majesty’s Govenin^sjt suffices against European encroachments; that so long as we do not alien-o.Ce- Arab opinion by attempting undue westernisation it suffices also against encroachments by Wahabi State, and that if need be, it can be more- explicitly asserted.
