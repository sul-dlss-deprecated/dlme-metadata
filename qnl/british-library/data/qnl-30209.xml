The map indicates: topography; hydrology, including salt water lakes; salt desert; human settlements, including Tehran, Samnan [Semnān] and Kashan; roads; railways; airfields and landing grounds. The key indicates that the portion of the map covered by the hatched area, south of Samnan, is probably the concession area covered by an 1880 royal Persian firman. The map was prepared by the Research Department of the Foreign Office in June 1945, and is part of a report on the Kavir-i-Khourian oil concession (ff 10-21).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><geographic>Kavir-i-Khourian</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100063578555.0x000004#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
