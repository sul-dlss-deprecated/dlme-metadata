Later the same day some 200 of the leading members of all communities in Bahrain were received by the Political Agent./ 2 , The Bahrain Petroleum Company Lira!ted (i) Labou r. On the 4th of January Mr. T;r ard P. Anderson the General Manager of the Bahrain Petroleum Company informed the,Political Agent that he had heard disquieting rumours which indicated that there was a possibility pf a 'strike of local labour at the Bahrain Petroleum Company. Careful enquiries were made but no confirmation whatsoever was obtained of,the intention oi the local employees of the Company to indulge in such co-ercive action. It was apparent that the transportation arrangements for the carriage of unskilled labour to and from their employment were unsatisfactory and the General Manager took such action as lay within his power to remedy defects in the system. Unfortunately the difficulty of obtaining spare parts and replacements for damaged material- has so far proved insuperable so that the position is not as satisfac tory qs could be desired. The difficulties of the Company's administration are at least in part understood by their labour and the management have been advised by the Political Agent to obtain sanction to bring into operation, should it become necessary, increases in the war allowance of the lower pay grades. This action will probably have the effect of prevent ing a disruption in the Company's work until April 1st when it is anticipated the Refinery construction programme will have advanced sufficiently to permit of the discharge of some 2,000 local employees and the return to the United States of America of approximately 300 men from the Berchtel McCone Corporation. The Company hope that the full programme for construction will be completed by the 1st of June. (ii) Drum Plant. i Some 600 Indian troops have recently arrived at Bahrain for * the purpose of dealing with the shipping of 100 octane drums at Sitrah. Bahrain Labour Committee ~ •* On the 11th a meeting of the Bahrain Labour Committee under the presidency of the Political Agent was held at'which it was confirmed that transportation would have to be provided between Muharraq and Manamah for labour employed at the Royal Air Force construction work on the latter^ island. It was also agreed that efficiency pay was reasonable provided it did not exceed an annual maximum increase in the daily rates beyond Annas eight. Tho Committee expressed their concern with regard to the scarcity of labour not only at the present time but also should further construction programmes have to be under taken later in the spring. 7. Iraqi artisans The Bahrain Petroleum Company have recruited approximately 280 artisans from Iraq for temporary work on the Refinery con struction. It is understood from the General Manager that the men have proved good workmen and no trouble of any description has been experienced. This happy state of affairs does not appear to have existed at the Arabian American Oil company's works at Dhahran for reports reaching the Political Agent indi cate that there have been a number of cases of misunderstanding between the management of the Company and the artisans they have recently recruited from Iraq. 8• Thefts of Royal Air Force ammunition at Muharraq Reference paragraph No.214 of Intelligence Summary No.23 of* i t Judicial proceedings taken by the Agency courts and the Bahrain courts against four receivers of ammunition stolen from '/the3. the Royal Air Force terminated in the conviction of the accused who received sentences ranging from six years to six months rigorous imprisonment. 9. weather Further rain during the period under review interrupted aerial activity both at Bahrain and at Sharjah. 10.

Later the same day the Political Agent drove via Falaii-ahl-Ali to Ras-al-Khaimah.^ On the 17th it had been intended to return to Sharjah via Dhaid but owing to heavy rains making the so called roads quite impassable the night of the 17th/13th was spent some lew miles inland irom Ras-al-Khaimah and the return to Sharjah was accomplished on the 18th with great difficulty.

Deacon. Mr. Skinner informed the Political Agent that a party of influential oilmen particularly closely connected with the com panies operating in Bahrain and Dhahran would be visiting this area towards the end of February. It, is understood that the party will consist of a- Director of the Texas Corporation, a Director of the California Standard Oil Company, the President/ of the Arabian American Oil Company, and possibly Lloyd N. Hamilton and Mr. E.A. Skinner himself. The purpose of the visit^has not so far been disclosed nor has Mr. Parker I. Hart, the Vice consul for the United States of America at Dhahran, received any information regarding all their intentions. (ii) On the 24th Mr. N.E. Baker and Mr. F.E. Wel*lings, geolo gists employed by the Iraq Petroleum Company, accompanied by Mr. E.V. Packer, M.B.E., the local manager of Messrs. Petroleum Concessions Limited, called on the Political Agent and informed him that Messrs. Petroleum Concessions Limited contemplated an extensive programme of geo-physical research on the Trucial coast commencing in the autumn of this year. It is apparently the intention of the geologists to commence operations about October and during the course qf the next two years not only do they hope to complete their survey of the Trucial Shaikhdoms but also they hope to be able to survey the eastern limits of Oman down to the neighbourhood of the South Arabian Coast in the neighbourhood of Masirah island. , (iii) Air Vice Marshal Robert George, C.B.E., M.C., visited Sharjah on the 25th and after spending the night there arrived in Bahrain on the 26th.

The Political Agent has been informed that the process of casting off of American labour employed on the Refinery construc tion project will commence in February when it is expected that a hundred men will return to the United States of America. They ^llbe followed by a further fifty early in March and a hundred anc - fifty about the end of March or beginning of April. (ii) Reference paragraph 7 of Intelligence Summary No.l of 1945. ^The Refinery construction work beingchead of schedule the Bahrain Petroleum Company are commencing to discharge all their Iraqi a.rtisans almost immediately and have cancelled recruitment orders which had been placed in India for additional Indian artisans. 15. Market conditions There is a general downward trend in the prices of some goods. This is probably due to the satisfactory news from the western Front which was followed by a fall in the exchange rate of the Sovereign from Rs.65/- to Rs.59/-. it remains to be seen . whether, as so cften has been the case in the past, this is merelyA r i \ 3. a temporary fall 'due to first reactions to the allied suc cesses being somewhat wild selling by gold speculators, 16. Anti-Locust Campaign on the Trucial Coast During the course of the Political Agent's recent tour on the Trucial Coast he met two members of the Anti-Locust Mission, one a Punjabi Mussulman and the other a Sikh from the Amritsar district, working in the interior. They appeared to be carrying on their work in difficult and strange sur roundings with great good humour and keenness. Some hatching is expected shortly from the Ras-al-Khaimah area, probably on much the same scale a*s occurred last year. The Anti-Locust officer has not been able to make a very wide survey of his area owing to lack of mechanical transport necessitating the use of camels with the consequent slowing up of the work. 17. Qatar Affairs Reference paragraph 22 of intelligence Summary No.24 of 1944. Recently the Shaikh of Qatar informed the Political Agent that it was his intention to replace his guards at Zubarah by three watchmen whose sole duty would be to look after the fit tings, &amp;c., of the fort. The difference between a watchman and a guard is it is feared too subtle to be detected by His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain. the period under review interrupted Bahrain and on the Trucial Coast. 18.

Royal Air Force (I) Bahrain During the period under review Air Commodore Oliver accom panied by rather more than twenty experts made a survey of the new Royal Air Force commitments on Muharraq Island and informed the Political Agent that it was probable that the personnel of the Royal Air Force at Muharraq would be increased by a further six hundred men'during the summer. The progress with the laying of pierced steel sheeting alongside the runways has been satisfactory and it is understood that very shortly a firm of Palestinian contractors will be commencing work on the laying of pierced steel sheeting on a bitumen and sand foundation on the main runways themselves. (ii) Sharjah The political Agent has been informed that it is proposed to double the present accommodation at Sharjah but no additional land will be required.2 . 25* Theft from U.S.A.T.G. Camp at Shar.jah On the night of the 18th/19th thieves of the Beni Qitab tribe broke into the U.S.A.f.C. sector of the Camp at Sharjah and stole a quantity of personal belongings from two tents adjacent to the hospital. Trackers were employed the next day to trace the thieves with the result that they were soon identified and at the instance of the Political Agent the Residency Agent addressed Shaikh Mohamed bin All bin Huwaidin of the Beni Qitab with a view to the‘property being recovered and the criminals punished. Action was taken promptly by the aforementioned Shaikh with the result that a quantity of^ the missing goods were returned and a fine of Ts. 500/- was paid by the sub-section of the tribe concerned. % 26. Fatal Motor Accident On the 8th a serious motor accident occurred between Awali and* Manama as a result of which five persons were killed and twelve others received injuries. The accident was due to a collision between two lorries, one loaded with coolies, at a narrow part of the road close to a heap of rubble which many years ago may have been a Shia mosque. The Shia qadis have persistently refused to permit the removal of .this and similar mounds and His Highness has hesitated to overrule their decisions as he is himself a Sunni. However it has now been decided to widen the road very considerably and to by-pass these ancient ruins. 27. Murder at Abu Dhabi On the night of 4th February Roopchand Parmanand a Hindu resident of Abu Dhabi was strangled and afterwards stabbed in his house at Abu Dhabi. It seems that ^he had been in residence for over fifty years in Abu Dhabi and besides dealing in pearls and grain had been in^the habit of purchasing stolen property. . Khamis Ibn al Noubi a slave of Ahmed bin Khalaf bin Ataiba conceived the idea that the^ Hindu was particularly wealthy and went to him one evening ostensibly to sell him a small quantity of gold and having persuaded the Hindu to dismiss his servant proceeded to kill him. The Shaikh of Abu Dhabi took immediate action which resulted in the apprehension and confession of the accused. The Shaikh has stated that he will take^ whatever action it is considered desirable by the political authorities. 28. American Missionary on the Trucial Coast Dr. Miss Hosman an independant American missionary being unable to extract title deeds from the Regent of Kalba for the house which had been placed at her disposal has decided .to return permanently to Saham in Muscat territory.

The accused Khamis bin Abdulla an-Nubi was adjudged guilty by the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi on the 9th March of the murder of Roopchand Permanand and was by the Shaikh's orders put to death in the same manner as he had killed his victim, 40. KAISER-I-HIND MEDAL . On the 4th the Hon’ble the political Resident in the Persian /Gulf- 2 - Gulf invested Mrs. Belgrave, wif£ of the Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, with the silver medal of the Kaiser-i-Hind at an evening reception specially held for the purpose. Mrs. Belgrave received the decoration for the work which she has done to encourage female education in Bahrain and for her services generally to the women of the state during the 20 years which she has resided in the Island#, in the Persian Gulf who was accompanied by the political Agent, Bahrain, and the BQ^adcasting Officer was met by the shaikh of Sharjah with whom were Captain M.P.O’C. Tandy, Political Officer, Trucial Coast, and Mr. jassim bin Mohammad, Residency Agent at Sharjah. After lunch the Kon'ble the Political Resident drove to Dubai where he inspected the site for the new hospital. The Shaikh of Sharjah gave a dinner party in the evening to which was invited in addition to the Hon’ble the'Political Resident and the political Agent, Bahrain, Shaikh Abdulla Al Jabir as Subah, the Director of Education from Kuwait who was passing through Sharjah en route to India. On the 7th the Hon'ble the political Resident drove to the inland village of Dhaid some 40 miles from Sharjah where he received the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah, the Shaikh of Ajman, the Shaikh of Sharjah, the Shaikh of Dubai, the Shaikh of umm al /the Regent Qawainland the paramount Shaikh of the Beni Qitab tribe. As of Kalba, all these gentlemen brought a number of relatives and followers with them the gathering was of considerable size. The Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and the Political Agent, Bahrain, discussed various matters of interest with the Shaikhs who had gathered and later they and their followers were entertained to lunch. As soon as lunch was over the Hon’ble the political Resident addressed the gathering and then returned to Sharjah, it is worthy of note that all the rulers of Trucial Oman were present at this gathering with the exception of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi who did not attend partly by reason of the fact that the launch which carried his invitation was wrecked and partly because of the distance it would have been necessary for him to travel had he received the invitation. The greatest amiability prevailed during the gathering and the Shaikhs appeared to be on very cordial terms with each other though with one excep tion they all appeared as is customary armed to the teeth. The exception was the most warlike of them all, Shaikh Mohammad bin Ali bin Huweidhan, the paramount Shaikh of the Beni Qitab, who out of courtesy to the Resident, arrived with his followers unarmed. 42.

Pelly, Esq., O.B.E., I.C.S., Political Agent, Bahrain, left in the P.C.L. launch 'Ghazal' for Qatar arriving there after a somewhat rough passage, on the morn ing of the 17th. During his stay the political Agent called on His Excellency Shaikh Abdullah bin Qassim A1 Thani, C.I.E., Ruler of Qatar, whose lively, almost mischievous, manner belies his frail appearance. The Shaikh 1 s.son, Hamad bin Abdullah bin Qasim in whose hands his father entrusts all state affairs, attended the political Agent on several occasions. He had ^ (in view of Qatar T s reputation for smuggling) the iJall to com plain that supplies were short. The Political Agent also met other Qatar notables. He returned to Bahrain on the 18th April.

(i) On the 19th April, Shaikh Salman bin Mohammed, fifth son of the senior uncle of the Ruler of Bahrain, left by air for Jerusalem to take up a course of judicial training. (ii) On the afternoon of April 21st Shaikh Rashid bin Abdulla, a. cousin of the Ruler, visited the Political Agent. On the next morning a carpenter working in the Agency was imprisoned. The incidents are connected because Shaikh Rashid came to complain that he was being exiled by the Ruler for drinking, and the carpenter was imprisoned for acting as the Shaikh's bootlegger. During his interview with the Political Agent, the Shaikh simulated weeping with a fair degree of success and his manner was vaguely offensive; he was, in fact, drunk. His lapse, and more particularly his punishment, was most welcome to his father since it was occasioned by, or perhaps merely the accompaniment, of his successful seduction of one of the latter’s mistresses. The story (worthy of the 'Arabian Nights') is being retailed locally with gleeful and Rabelaisian embellishments. 58. R.A.P.« SHARJAH . (i) On the night of lst/2nd at .about 2.30 a.m. one of the Royal Air Force lorries, driven by an unknown person, ran into and damaged several reed huts and reed sheds at the entrance of Dairah (Dubai) bazaar. The matter was reported by the Shaikh of Dubai to the Residency Agent who on his part brought it to the notice of the officer Commanding, Royal Air /Force— 2 ** Force, Sharjah, and asked him to institute the necessary T ^ e Residency Agent also went to Dubai and done. The Commanding officer replied that he had instituted a thorough investigation; but that $? nc ^ ete evidence to go upon, it was difficult to find the offender. He, however, promised to continue a ™? to let the Residency Agent know as soon as definite information has been obtained. Meanwhile the nnb?? n ^nri S of f iG ? r an&lt; J h ^ s Adjutant went to the Ruler of Duoa! and. apologised to him and assured him that if it was proved that R,A.F. personnel were responsible, severe disciplinary action would be taken against the offenders. &gt; t pon!^ ntlrae t 1 he R °y a;l . Air Force &gt; as a ^i^amaiy gesture, are sending a work party to repair the damaged places. (ii) On the 9th a local woman named Halimah bint Hamad Shaikh of Sharjah that while she was on her way from the garden to the town an Indian soldier tried to rape her and when she refused to give in, he beat her severely and tore up her clothes. The Shaikh at once took a tracker 7 and went himself with the woman to the place where the inci- J; . ha PP ena £ and then to the Army quarters following the footprintw of the offender. He then returned and reported t0 Residency Agent who at once communicated with the Commanding Officer and asked him to make the necessary investigations. The offender has not yet been discovered but enquiries are in progress. 59.. INDIAN FILM UNIT . An Indian Film Unit under the direction of the infor mation and Broadcasting Department of the Government of India arrived in Bahrain on the 1st of April, 1945, on a tour oi the Persian Gulf and Oman with a view to preparing ThPv C h^ nt ^ ry / i:U ? sh ° wlng the intQrest of India in this area. *he/ had previously stayed for three days at Shariah.

I Referenqe-paragraph 65(iii) above. Mr. Hudson Davies and Mr. English, who have been examining the personnel requirements from the United Kingdom of the Anglo- Iranian oil Company for 1946, are visiting Bahrain to discuss the difficulties which the Bahrain Petroleum Company are experiencing in recruiting staff for their enlarged Refinery. 68 . MID DLE EAST ANTI-LOCUST UNIT . Messrs. Vesey-FitzGerald and Thesiger of the Middle East Anti-Locust Unit visited Bahrain on May 8th and left the next day. They held consultations with the Political Agent regarding their proposed journeys in the Trucial Coast area. 69. ROYAL AIR FORCE. SHARJAH . (i) At about 0400 hrs. on the morning of the 19th fjlring broke out in the lines of No. 1261 Indian Pioneer Company. The M Alarm' was sounded and the body of a Hindu Sepoy was found shot through the head with service rifle by his side. There were rto other casualities although it was found that about 12 shots had been fired into the tent occupied by the Company V.C.Os, At first, it appeared that the Sepoy had run amok and had committed suicide after trying to murder his Indian officers. Further investigation however, revealed what appeared to be a plot by other members of the Company to murder the V.C.Os. and evidence to show that the Sepoy had been murdered. The motive for this attempt to kill the V.C.Os. of the Company is not known, nor is it known why. the Sepoy was murdered, unless it was to give inci dent the appearance of one man running, amok and then committing suicide. A Court of Inquiry was held and two N.C.O.s have been arrested and are awaiting trial by Court Martial on a charge of murder. The company has been disarmed and the British Officer Commanding it has been evacuated by air suffering from a complete mental breakdown. (ii) Reference paragraph 58(ii) of I.S. No. 8 of 1945. The Political Officer, Trucial coast, had reason to believe that,the enquiry into this alleged assault was not being conducted with due expediency and efficiency. He* therefore, after conferring with the Officer Commanding Station, took the woman concerned to the camp with a view to holding an identification parade. The Officer commanding the Company (No. 506 A.W.) informed the Political Officer that the feeling in the Indian camp was running high due to shooting incident in No. 1261 Company referred to in (i) above, and he was not in favour of holding a public identification parade until the extent of the disaffection (if any) was known and the situation had returned to normal. He agreed, however, to take all the men answering in any way to the description given by the woman in a lorry to a place outside the camp and there to hold an identifica tion parade. This was arranged, but on returning to his car, which was parked in the middle of the camp, the Political Officer was informed by the woman that she had already recognized the man who had attacked her. Most of the company at this time were engaged in striking tents and she pointed out the Sepoy, an elderly Sikh with grey hair. Summary of evidence proceedings against this Sepoy are still in progress, the result of which will be reported in due course. The evidence recorded up to date, however, establishes a strong alibi for the accused person and, as a result of this and the absence of any eye witnesses, it is not expected that the case will reach the stage of a Court Martial. 70. THE SHAIKHA AYESHA . On May 10th the Political Agent called (at the lady*s request) on the Shaikha Ayesha, the widow of the late Ruler of /Bahrain.,..Bahrain. She expressed the greatest curiosity to kno\v what had happened to Hitler. Indeed curiosity about most things seems to be the lady's most outstanding characteristic; she is, though, amazingly well-informed and intelligent,, 70L. LABOUR .' The Bahrain Government have informed the Political Agent that His Highness Shaikh Salman withdraws all objection to the employment of Italian or German prisoners on military works in Bahrain provided they are under proper military supervision. 72. PEARLING . Pearling is not expected to begin until some time late this month though a few boats have already begun operations. 73. INDIAN FILM UNIT. Reference paragraph 59 of I.S. No. 8 of 1945.

Ten ships (eight British and two American) called at Bahrain during the period under report. The imports consisted of 1,038 tons general cargo for Bahrain and l,08l£ tons for transhipment to the mainland. The exports were 57£- tons general cargo and 64,800 tons petroleum products. 76. MOVEMENTS OF OFFICIALS . On the 20th May, C.J. Pelly, Esquire, O.B.E., I.C.S., Political Agent, Bahrain, left by B.O.A.C. plane for Sharjah. He returned to Bahrain on the 23rd May. 77. THE TRUCIAL COAST . _ During his few days on the Trucial Coast the Political Agent renewed acquaintance with the Shaikhs of Sharjah, Dubai, Ajman and Has al Khaima and met for the first time Mohd. bin Ali bin Huwaithin, Chief of the Bani Qitab, one of the most powerful tribes of the hinterland. v The Chief was at a dinner given by the Shaikh of Dubai for the Political Agent. Also present was Mohd. as-Sulaiman of the Al Bu Shamis to whose protestations that he was his ''humble servant', King f Ibn Saud is said to have remarked 'and an humble friend, Shaikh, of the Sultan of Muscat'. Like all of his kind, he is an humble servant when it pays him to be one. 78. ROYAL AIR FORCE. SHARJAH . ' (i) Reference paragraph 69(i) of Bahrain intelligence Summary No. 9. ’Iraq The case was referred to South/Area Headquarters, P.A.I.C., who sent Special Investigation Bureau personnel to carry out further investigations. The result of these investi- - gations is not known as the Special investigation Bureau Officers apparently left Sharjah without reporting to the Station Commander. It appears, however, that the original investigation was inadequate and inefficiently carried out. ^ The two N.C.O.s are still under arrest and awaiting trial. The delay on the part of A.H.Q. in convening a Court Martial is presumably due to the incomplete evidence and the belief that other persons were involved in the shooting. There is no reason to apprehend further trouble breaking out in the Company. (ii) Reference paragraph 69(ii) of Bahrain Intelligence Summary No. 9. The case against the Sepoy has been dropped due to lack of evidence. The Political Officer, however, has reason to believe that many of the defence witnesses committed perjury, (iii) At about 10 a.m. on the 15th an R.A.F. truck crashed ' s into a reed hut in Sharjah and killed a sick man who was lying inside and then drove on without stopping. The Political Officer, Trucial Coast, went to the scene of the accident after calling upon the Royal Air Force authorities to take immediate steps to trace and apprehend the driver of the vehicle. Investi gations resulted in the tracing of the vehicle and the arrest of the driver who has been arrested and charged with man slaughter. /it•.•.- 2 - * It appears that the vehicle belonged to the R.A.F. Anti- Malaria Squad who, in the course of their duty, left it on the morning of the accident, outside the village in charge of an Aircraftsman who was not a qualified driver. For some unknown reason he attempted to drive the vehicle and entered the village where, from the track marks it is apparent that he lost control. He first collided with the parapet of a small well, swerved to avoid a fence, crashed through the reed hut, drove on a short distance, stopped, basked into another fence and then drove off. The deceased was a Persian working as a coolie in the R.A.F. camp and the question of paying compensation to his family is under consideration. . 79. PEARLING . Reference paragraph 72 of Bahrain intelligence Summary No. 9. Employment on Bahrain Petroleum Company and Service works still absorbs many divers, but high prices last year were an encouragement and pearlers are paying very good wages to divers who will work for them, often much.in excess of the Government rate. The price of a Jiwen (first quality) pearl at present is Rs. 180/- per CHAW*, and there is a strong demand.from Indian buyers. Ramzan has divided the pearling season in half. The first began on May 19th and v/ill continue until August 5th. The second half begins on September 10th and goes on to October 31st and will be a better time for diving in the calmer seas after the monsoon. 80. INDIAN FILM UNIT . Reference paragraph 73 of Bahrain intelligence Summary No. 9. The Indian Film Unit have been'held up in Bahrain awaiting the arrival of new film from India.

Most of these concerned petty incidents but the ‘ /leitmotif.... c XA/ic&lt;-Ut£Ur&lt;.* mm r A wmmmm - 2 - leitmotif was that the Shaikh of Qatar had not observed his side of the agreement reached last June. The agreement is so vague that it is extremely difficult to determine who is either breaking or keeping it. It did not, as Mr. Gandhi would say, result in any 'change of heart' and it is hard to believe that relations are really much improved. 89. SHAIKHA AYESHA . Referenco paragraph 70 of intelligence Summary No. 9 of 1945. The Political Agent returned the call of Shaikha Ayesha on June the 9th. 90. OIL . When the Manager of the Bahrain Petroleum Company recently visited His Highness the Shaikh, the latter told him that he was not,sleeping well. On the Manager’s enquiring the .reason and expressing sympathy, the Shaikh replied that there was far too much oil moving about under the ground where he slept and that more of it should be taken out. 91 - INDIAN FILM UNIT . Reference paragraph 80 of Bahrain intelligence Summary No. 10. The Indian Film Unit have been prevented from visiting the scene of the pearling operations so far, first by their unwillingness to go to sea in the launch provided for them,, and secondly by a strong 'shemal' wind which blew during the last few days of this period. They have filled in time filming Bahrain and hope to take a further set of photographs of Bapco and B.O.A.C. installations and personnel. On the 10th June, they visited Sharjah by R.A.F. plane and took shots of the B.O.A.C. Station there and planes alighting and leaving. 92. LIB TE QROL 0GI CAL.

Detection of the alleged theft appears to have been made possible by information given to the Police by a local taxi-driver to the effect that one of the accused had promised to sell him tyres. • it is rumoured that His Highness the sheikh will shortly marry his third wife, the daughter of one Abdulla al Zaid, an^ ex-pearl merchant, already related by marriage to the Al Khalifa. The bride is said to be beautiful and the marriage^to have none but the simplest motives. The wedding will be quiet. 98. TRUCIAL COAST . (i) On the 14th Shaikh Humaid bin Mohd. bin Salim of Ras al Khaimah left Sharjah for Ras al Khaimah with two of his men, one of whom was of the Huboos and the other of the Ghaflah tribes. On the way, between Jirri and Ras al Khaimah, the Ghafli bedouin killed the Hibsi who was armed, looted Shaikh Humaid 1 s money (estimated to be about Rs.800/-)^and his clothing and made a get away towards Dubai. Shaikh Humaid was unarmed except for his dagger. A pursuit party was sent after the culprit but he has not yet been apprehended. He is said to have 97. MARRIAGE OF THE RULER. /taken/ - 2 - taken refuge with Shaikh Muhammad bin Ali bin Huwaidin of the Beni Qitab. (ii) The one-year-old camel looting dispute between Muhammad bin Ali bin Rubayyi’, Chief of the Beni Qitab of the Aflaj, and the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi has reached a critical stage, and skirmishes between the parties are expected to take place at any moment. The Shaikh of Abu Dhabi considers himself strong enough to cope with situation and has sent supplies of rice and grain to his men at A1 ’Ain in Buraimi and has ordered the withdrawal of his camels for use in repulsing any raids by the Beni Qitab. It is only expected that raids will be made by the Beni Qitab in the Buraimi area. 99. THE INDIAN FILM UNIT . Reference paragraph 91 of Bahrain Intelligence Summary No. 11 of 1945. The Indian Film Unit left by launch for the scene of the pearling operations on the 24th and returned on the 26th June. They expect to leave for India the first week of July. 100. L ABOUR TROUBLES . The Municipal scavengers struck for higher wages on the, 26th instant. Messrs. Gray Mackenzie's stevedores and boatmen made similar demands on the 28th., and the taxi-drivers were contemplating making them at the same time. The 'Zeitgeist' explains these happenings but their immediate occasion seems to have been the action of a Palestinian contractor imported by the A.M.W.D. to engage and work labour for the new air-strip -at Muharraq aerodrome. This man broke, in the spirit at any rate, an unwritten (and very flexible) agreement between employers of labour .here, to pay the same wages for similar work. The results were a flow of labour to him, general unrest amongst all labour in the Island and the strikes and threats of striking just reported. The situation was met by his stopping recruit ment and dismissing a token number of coolies. The Bahrain Petroleum Company had not, fortunately, to face a strike but did lose temporarily, a number of their workmen. Two points were emphasised by these happenings. Firstly, the labour market here is a seller’s and not a buyer's market^ secondly, the island being such a compact unit, the labour as a whole is immediately sensitive to any changes made in the conditions of any section of it. The attitude of labour, and indeed lesser employees of all kinds, is an unattractive mixture of inde pendence and superficial servility. 101. METEOROLOGICAL.

C Intelligence Summary of the Political Agency, Bahrain, for the period 1st to 15th July, 1945 * Fourteen ships (7 British and 7 American) called at Bahrain during the period under report. The imports were 2,409-^ tons general cargo for Bahrain and 158 tons for transhipment to the mainland, while the exports consisted of 1,23,500 tons petroleum products. Two ships were still in port at the end of the period. 103. MOVEMENTS OF OFFICIALS. (i) On the 10th July Lieut-General Sir Arthur Smith, K.B.E., C.B., D.S.O., M.C., General Officer Commanding-in- Chief, Paiforce, accompanied by Brigadier J.W. Hinchgliffe, D.S.O., Group Captain Brake, Major R. Mytton, and Captain D. Myers, arrived by air from Shaiba. On the 11th July, accompanied by Lieut-Col. G.R. Hesketh, the Station Commander, the party left by air for Sharjah. On the 12th July the Station Commander returned to Bahrain and the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief and his party left by air for Masira. They returned to Bahrain on the 13th and left the next day for Basra. (ii) On the 15th July, the Political A'gent left by air for Sharjah. 104. THEFT AT BAHRAIN PETROLEUM COMPANY STORE. This was reported at paragraph 96 of these summaries. The trial in the Sessions Court of Edward Minnick (American) and Arthur Koch (Canadian) concluded on the 4th of July. Koch was acquitted and Minnick sentenced to one year's simple imprisonment under Section 381, Indian Penal Code. It is understood that he intends to appeal against his conviction. The general local opinion seems to be that he deserved this sentence and, indeed, that it was lenient. 105. RICE IMPORTS. A certain amount of rice has recently been imported into Bahrain privately from Persia. Efforts by the local Government to control its.sale resulted in the immediate stoppage of the imports and their diversion to Saudi Arabia where, presumably, the prices are not controlled. 106. QATAR . The agreement signed by the Shaikhs of Bahrain and Qatar in June, 1944, has not, unfortunately, terminated the illfeeling between the two States and this has easily found expression in conflicting interpretations - a very easy matter for both parties since it would not have been signed had it been first framed in any but the vaguest terms. These merely stated that conditions should revert to those persisting before the split occurred between the two States in 1936. The Shaikh of Bahrain has taken this to mean that the shaikh of Qatar's previous prohibition of the entrance of Bahrainis to the west coast of Qatar has been rescinded and tested his view by sending some of his subjects there to collect lime. They were promptly expelled having been ill-treated and this, with similar instances, has formed the subject of unfructuous correspondence between / the.....- 2 - * the Shaikhs of Bahrain and Qatar via the political Agent for several months past, 107 - R OYAL AIR FORCE, SHAHJAH . (1) Reference paragraph 78(i) of Bahrain Intelligence Summary No. 10. The two Indian N.C.Os. are still under close arrest awaiting trial by Court Martial. The reason for the delay in bringing these men to trial is- not known. (2) During the period under report the sum of Rs. 23,000/- was stolen from the safe in the Accounts Office of the R.A.F. H.Qo The key of the safe was kept in a smaller safe the key of which was held by the Accounts Officer. The key of the small safe was found to be missing and when a duplicate was obtained the theft was discovered. It is thought to be an 'inside job' involving only R.A.F. personnel. The stolen money was in Rs. 10 and Rs. 100 currency notes but no record of the numbers was kept. Notes of smaller denominations amounting to about Rs. 60,000 were untouched. The Assistant provost Marshal came to Sharjah from R.A.F. HQ. to investigate the theft but so far no arrests have been made nor has the money been traced. 108. U .SlA.T.C . . An American Survey party (Lieutenant Moore and 4 G.I.s) have arrived in Sharjah, The Political Officer, Trucial Coast, arranged for them to visit Abu Dhabi and the area west of Buraimi, They left for Abu Dhabi on the 27th June and arrived there on the 29th. They stayed one night in Abu Dhabi and left for Buraimi the next day. They are in daily wireless contact'with Sharjah. 109. RAS AL KHAIMAH . On the 24th June, Mr. B.H. Lermitte of Messrs. Petroleum Concessions Limited went to Sharjah by air and stayed at the B.O.A.C. Fort there. His visit was in connection with the Ras-al-Khaimah Oil Concession which was negotiated -during the Shaikh’s recent visit to Bahrain. The Shaikh, accompanied by Mr. S.B. Monteiro (Gray Mackenzie’s agent), visited Mr. Lermitte in the afternoon who paid him a sum of money in connection with the concession. The political Officer, Trucial Coast, was on tour at the time. Mr. Lermitte returned to Bahrain by air on the 25th June and the shaikh left for Ras al Khaimah. 110 • IHDIAN FILM UNIT . Reference paragraph 99 of Bahrain Intelligence Summary No. 12.

Birge has taken over as Vice-Consul of the United States of America at Dhahran from Mr. William L. Sands who, it is understood, has reverted to his post at Jedda. 115. PETROLEUM CONCESSIONS. LIMITED . Mr. Heseldin, Assistant Manager of the ’Iraq Petroleum Company, Haifa, and Mr. Dixon, the ox-engineer in charge of the Qatar Oil Field accompanied by Mr. w&amp;tts, who is a contractor for Indian labour, visited Bahrain on July the 23rd. The object of their visit was to concert measures which, if it is possible to bring them to fruition, will resulc in the re-working of the Qatar field. .16. QATAR AGAIN . Reference paragraph 106 of those summaries. For an hour and a half, after sitting with him in the Joint Court, the Political Agent listened to His Highness the Sheikh on the subject of his claims, rights, wrongs and griev ances in and concerning Qatar. Since the implication of most of the Sheikh's arguments was, as usual, that he had sovereign rights in part of Qatar territory (Zubarah) - rights which His Majesty’s Government have never admitted - the conversa tions resulted in little else but the exhaustion of the Political Agent. 117 • the weatjer alp the ELECTRICAL SUPPLY . The local people say that for ten years Bahrain has not had weather of the severity experienced within the period covered by this summary. For days and nights without inter mission the heat has been steamy and intense, and there has been no wind to relieve the continuous furnace-like atmosphere or ruffle the oily expanse of water in Manamah bay. It was during this ffxxxxx that fate decreed that the electrical system in Bahrain should sporadically cease to function for long hours at a time. The reasons for this are that the engines driving the generators are old, and more particularly (and more importantly) they have never been properly maintained. The present State Engineer received them as a somewhat grim legacy and during the last fortnight has been perhaps (and this issaying a good deal) the most harassed man in Bahrain. He has not spared himself in doing his best to make the stoppage as infrequent as possible; but he has had many difficulties to compete with. in the typically whimsical, fickle, inconstant and wholly damnable Arab way, workmen were taken away from him to build a house when they were in the middle of constructing a power-house for a new generator which, if it had been installed, would have avoided the stoppages. Forty to fifty R.A.F. personnel have been flown out of Bahrain as a result of heat exhaustion and severe 'prickly heat' - a skin disease which in its mildest form produces nervous irritation and when severe can be acutely poisonous - no European or Indian in Bahrain is now free from it. Many of the Arabs also suffer. There are 17 Indian Other Ranks in hospital with heat stroke. 118. THEFT IN BAPCO STORE . Reference paragraph 104 of Intelligence Summary No.13 of 1945. Minnick has now given notice of his intention to appeal against his sentence. 119. AMERICAN PLANE MISHAP . On the 29th July It was reported to the political Agent that an American plane travelling from Karachi to Abadan had been lost for the last two days. It had been last heard of east of Sharjah but had sent no distress signals. political Agents, Muscat and Kuwait, and the Residency Agent at Sharjah were informed.• On the same day the wreckage of this plane was discovered by Bedouin 13-J- miles south-east of Dubai, and reported to the Royal Air Force. Rescue parties were rushed to the spot and the bodies of three of the crew removed to Abadan by air for burial. The wreckage has been examined with a view to dis covering the cause of the crash but its results are not yet known here. 120. AMERICAN SURVEY PARTY . Reference paragraph 108 of Intelligence Summary No.13 of 1945. The American Survey Party returned to Sharjah from Buraimi and Abu Dhabi on the 7th after completing their work in those areas. On the 15th they left Sharjah by launch on a voyage along the coast up to Ras Dibah. 121. TRUCIAL COAST .

The announcement on the evening of the 15th August came as somewhat of an anti-climax to that of V-S Day three months previously. Celebrations were more reserved and the inevitable lassitude engendered by the month of Ramadhan undoubtedly played its part. Flags were flown on all public buildings but those on private houses and even barasti' huts were less conspi cuous than on V-E Day. The 16th, 17th, 19th and 20th August were observed as public holidays. On the 17th August, the Assistant Political Agent received local notables after sunset in the Agency garden and on the 20th August a reception was given for the British and American community. 135.

LABOUR TROUBLES - BAPCO . Some 30 South African employees of the Bahrain Petroleum Company submitted a demand in mid-August for increases in pay and a general rise in the rates payable to South Africans to bring them into line viith those of Canadian and - eventually - American employees of the Company. Attempts to negotiate with the employees indi vidually were met with a refusal to discuss terms except through representatives of the strikers. Eventually, some 20 South Africans, nearly all of whom were operators in the refinery, stayed away from work and on the 25th August the Company discharged them for cause. The employees refused to accept transportation and a large deputation waited on the Assistant Political Agent that day to air their grievances. After discussions lasting several hours with three representative spokesmen and also with Mr. ward Anderson, the Chief Local Represent ative, the strikers decided to accept transportation back to South Africa where they apparently intend taking legal advice to remedy their contention that discharge for cause was not warranted. So ended the first organised attempt in Bapco of non-American employees to obtain for themselves the same rates of pay as for American personnel. The problem is not new and the same difficulties have arisen from this question in other oil companies. The strike and dismissal of so many operators resulted in the shutting down of two crude stills and one reformer in the Refinery. 138. LABOUR TROUBLES - DHAHRAN . The strike of Italian workers in Aramco was no sooner settled than a general strike of Arab employees was declared. The American Vice-Consul in Dhahran, Mr. Birge, informed the Assistant political Agent that the strikers were ordered by His Majesty the King to return to work and delegates from the Oil Company, the strikers, and Saudi officials met to discuss their grievances. Mr. Birge anticipates the Company having to make some concessions in increases of rates of pay to their employees but the result of meetings of representatives is not known as yet. 139.

( a ) Traffic Offences . i The steady increase in traffic accidents which was noted in the Bahrain Government’s last annuaj. report has been unfortunately well maintained. This is largely due to the increase in the number of Service and Oil Company vehicles driven by locally recruited men many of whom would be unable properly to control a donkey much less a powerful motor lorry. In one case which attracted some attention it was thought at first that the driver was one of this type. Two Indians were knocked down and seriously injured by a vehicle which then drove on. Subsequently when the case was heard by the political Agent, sitting as District .Magistrate / it was established that the driver was an officer of the Royal Indian Navy. He was convicted of an offence under section 338 of the Indian penal Code and sentenced to six months' rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs.1,000/-. (b) Thefts . Both in Uanamah and Jiuharraq, there has, for some time past, been an epidemic of thieving. partly this is due to the lowering of what in the Bahraini passes for 'moral standards'; more particularly it seems to be due to the inadequacy of the police arrangements. At night these consist of 'Naturs' (watchmen) who are supposed to patrol the town. They are only paid Rs.25/- to Rs.30/- per month, and as most of them are married and (despite the demands of their calling) have children, it is impos sible for them to live on this amount. They are thought to have connived at, if not actually committed some of the thefts. Shaikh Khalifah bin Mohammed, the Super intendent of Police, seems to enjoy the pursuit of fish more than that of thieves. He is a keen deep sea angler. 152. I1ANAKAH TORN WATER SUPPLY . His Highness the shaikh sanctioned the expenditure for this scheme before the war; and it had got as far as calling for estimates for machinery, etc., when the war broke out. The State authorities have now again shown commendable activity in the matter and, at their instance, Mr. jonos of Holloway Brothers visited Bahrain during the /period....Iperiod under report in order to make a survey preliminary to the installation of the water supply plant by his firm. He anticipated no difficulty in the execution of the plan provided that materials (including piping and so on) could be obtained from the United Kingdom. Every effort will be made to do this as soon as possible. 153. R EMOVAL OF ' ,r AR?I.!E CONTROLS - SAUDI AKA3IA , The Saudi Arabs in Bahrain state that the Finance Ministry at Hasa has issued a notice by order of His Majesty the King, announcing that the restrictions on the Saudi export trade will be removed on the 26th Bil Qada 1364 (1.11.1945). 154. PETROLEUM CONCESSIONS, LIMITED . Petroleum Concessions, Limited, whose activities practically entirely ceased during the war, now hope to re-open their Qatar fields in 1946 and to send a small explo ratory party to the Trucial Coast in the coming cold weather. 155. S HAIKH OF oliARJAH , The Shaikh of Sharjah met and entertained Shaikh Abdulla bin Hamad A1 Khalifah, brother of the Ruler of Bahrain, when he arrived at Sharjah en route to Bahrain from India. Very typically, the Shaikh of Sharjah seized the opportunity to importune Shaikh Abdulla to help him in obtaining an export permit for motor cycles from Bahrain. Shaikh Abdulla promised that he would do so and, very typically, will do nothing about it. 156. METEOROLOGICAL.

T NEFT OF AI/FiaiNITI ON. 18,000 rounds of .303 ammunition have been stolen from the Bahrain Government store on Jida Island. This island is used as a jail as well as an arsenal and Shaikh Khalifah, the Superintendent of police, in his investigation of the theft has arrested the ten policemen and seven prisoners who formed its population. He is endeavouring to obtain evidence from them by methods so notoriously revived by the Gestapo and the Cheka. One source of information states that the N.C.O. in charge of the prison connived at the theft with the aid of t Tr o of the prisoners and subsequently sold the ammunition to Persians who have since left Bahrain for an unknown destina tion in Persia. 159o HOUSING SHORTAGE. Bahrain is sharing in the world housing shortage by reason of the influx to the Island during the war years which was not, due to the shortage of materials, followed by an increase in building. The.situation was temporarily met by the enforcing of a regulation prescribing maxima in rent increases and limiting very severely the landlord’s power either to evict or to terminate a lease. On the whole, landlords accepted these restrictions with a fairly good grace during the wars but, now r that it has ended, they seem to expect that the law of supply and demand should be allowed to operate without check. Neither the political Agent - who is responsible for the interests of the tenants most of whom are foreigners - nor His Highness the Shaikh can wholly accept this view. Modifications in the 'Law of Rents' do, however', appear to be necessary and a committee, with representatives from the Agency and the Bahrain Government, has been apuointed to report thereon. 160. N EW TELEPHONE SYSTEM ., The existing telephones in Bahrain are museum pieces equipped with small handles which need to be wound before the sleepy Arab operator can be induced to reply. The wiring of the system makes it possible to 'listen in' to the conversation of others. Telephoning ordinarily is, therefore, exhaustive of time and^patience; in the hot weather it results in states verging on insanity. All concerned are accordingly anxiously awaiting the installation of an automatic telephone system by Messrs. Cable &amp; Wireless, Limited, at the request of the Bahrain Government. Negotiations for an agreement between the two parties arc practically complete but the commencement of the installation is being held up by the difficulty being experienced by Messrs. Cable &amp; Wireless, Limited, in obtaining land for the new buildings required at a reasonable price and' at a suitable site. The political Agent has asked His Highness the Shaikh to help the company and he has promised to do so. 161. corrigendum . The officer referred to at paragraph 157 of Bahrain Intelligence Summary No. 18 should have been described as /'•temporary officer... o o'temporary officer of the Royal Indian Naval Reserve'. 162 * T H5 TRUCIAL COAST AND THE END OF THE FAR . During his visit reported at paragraph 157 above Po , lltical A S ent wa s enabled to observe the present state on ^De Trucial Coast. Allied, and because of their long connection with His Majesty’s Government, more particularly, British prestige, is higher amongst the Shaikhs than ever before. ^ At the same time this has its disadvantage because the prestige is the result of an imagined power - power .nich the Shaikhs expect to be exercised in providing them with unlimited food and as much arms and ammunition as they can 0 : tain from us. When they realise that these results cannot lollow, there may well be a re-action. Even if they are willing tney are entirely unable to appreciate that our resources are limited and that their own needs cannot be met without consideration of those of others. 163. U.S.A.T.C.

On the 30th October His Highness Shaikh Sir 3alman bin Hamad al Khalifah, K.C.I.E., Ruler of Bahrain, accompanied by his uncle Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa al Khalifah, called at the Agency on the Hon'ble Lieutenant Colonel A.C. Gallo r ay, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and on the Hon'ble Sir Geoffrey prior, K.C.I.E. The Hon'ble the Political Resident and the Hon'ble Sir Geoffrey Prior returned these calls the same day at His Highness' palace at Qodhaibiyeh. 163. DUBAI-ABU DHABI BOUNDARY DISPUTE . /Assistant During the night of the 17th of October Shaikh Rashid, son of the Shaikh of Dubai, occupied Khor Ghanadhah with about 300 armed men. Many of these were carried by sea and they brought with them large quantities of building material and showed every intention of building a fort which would command the Khor. ‘ As in the other frucial Coast States, the boundary between the sheikhdoms of Dubai and Abu Dhabi has never been defined and while negotiations between these two were nearing a conclusion in 1937 Ghanadhah was not included in the Shaikh of Dubai's most extreme claim. His son's act&gt;^therefore, apart from being a breach of the treaty with His Majesty's Government of 1853 - which forbade aggression by sea - was a Hitlerian attempt to present Government and the shaikh of Abu Dhabi with a fait accompli. The visits of the/political Agent and of the political Agent to the Trucial Coast recorded in the first paragraph of this summary wer :* made as a result of this move. The Assistant political Agent reported that the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi was preparing, by calling in his tribal supporters, to meet force with force, and it seemed^ not improbable that hostilities, perhaps ultimately involving every shaikhdom on the coast, were imminent. Acting on instructions from the Hon'ble the Political Resident the Political Agent demanded from the Shaikh of Dubai that hu withdraw his forces forthwith from Ghanadhah. This demand was complied with on the 29th of October and the status quo restored; at the same time a promise was extracted from the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi that he would not take any retaliatory \ /action..,.- 2 - action. The whole incident had for its causes the Shaikh of Dubai’s greed for more territory inspired by his belief in impending oil development, and the ability to exploit that greed which his recently acquired wealth - obtained by the war profiteering of his subjects - has afforded him. 169 - BAHRAIN STUDENTS FOR EGYPT . The Bahrain Government is sending sixteen students for a four years’ course of study in Egyptian schools. Thirteen of these left Bahrain by air on the 30th and 31st October and the remainder are due to leave on the 1st November. 170. AMERICAN SURVEY PARTY .

The pearling season was to close officially this year on the 31st October, but owing to the rough weather encountered during the last days of the season all the boats had returned to Bahrain by the 30th of this month. There were 121 boats engaged in pearl diving this year and a total of some 4,483 persons. The catch this year was small but this is offset to some extent by the high prices now being offered for pearls in the Bombay market. 172. SHIPPING. Nine ships (2 British, 4 American, and 3 Panamanian) called at the port of Bahrain during the period under report. They discharged 3,793 tons general cargo for Bahrain and 4|- tons for transhipment to the mainland. 71,000 torts of petroleum products were exported from Bahrain during the fortnight. (Sid. ) C.J.
