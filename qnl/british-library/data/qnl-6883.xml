I olitical Intelligence E)epaktment Eoreign Office, Special No. 10. MEMORANDUM ON SUPPLEMENTARY BRITISH COMMITMENTS TO THE IDRISI REGARDING THE FARSAN ISLANDS. THE Farsan Islands lie off the Idrisi’s coast, and are of considerable import ance tor the strategic command of the Red Sea. At one period beiore the war they were in the Idrisi s possession, but, like his mainland dominions, they were recognised by other Powers as being Ottoman territory, and betore the war the Idrisi haa been IOm r^ 0111 by the 0ttoman Government. W ith the outbreak of war between the Ottoman Government and His Majesty's Government, and the establishment of. the Keel bea blockade, lurkish control over the islands ceased and they lay at our mercy but the question of their disposal had already arisen over our negotiations with the Idrisi, which began in September 1914 (see “ Special No. 4 Memorandum on British Commitments to the Idrisi). After discussion between the Resident at Aden, the Government of India and the India Office, it was decided to make no promises regarding the islands to the Idrisi, but to occupy them navally ourselves. I he Idrisi forestalled us, however, by occupying them with his own forces on the 30th January, 1915. It might be held, therefore, that the Farsan Islands, as part of the Idrisi’s dominions, were implicitly included in the Agreement with the Idrisi which was signed on the 30th April and ratified by the Government of India on the 6th November, 1915; but there were various attempts from the British side to make the status of the islands more definite. Under Article 5 of the Agreement, His Majesty’s Government undertook “ to safeguard the Idrisi Saiyid’s territories from all attack on the seaboard from, any enemy who might molest him,” and “ to guarantee his independence in his own domain.' In virtue of this clause, the Resident at Aden wrote to the Idrisi (260663/16) on the 29th May, 1915. that it was understood that he had occupied Farsan, and sent him a British flag, suggesting that he might hoist it to make known to ships of any friendly Power that the islands were under our protection. On the 4th June, 1915, the India Office telegraphed to the Resident that the flag should be hoisted, but on the 16th June the Resident received a reply to his letter of the 29th May from the Idrisi in which the flag was not mentioned, and accordingly no action on the India Office telegram was taken. Again, on the 28th February, 1916, the Resident wrote to the Idrisi as follows (93494/15):— “ We think, O Friend, that there ought to be some understanding between us about the Farsan Islands, which we are aware are in your occupation. All that we want, and trust, is that you will not surrender the same to any Power nor admit any other Power to their precincts. Further, we ask you that if ever you are attacked there, you should call on us for assistance, which we shall readily give.” To this the Idrisi returned an extremely non-committal reply, dated the 4th March, 1916:— “ The Islands of Farsan are practically part and parcel of our territory in the past. As you intimate that you wish and trust that we should not sur render the islands or any portion thereof to any Power, we thank you for your feelings and your readiness to help and co-operate with us in case an attack is made on us.” Towards the end of the year 1916. however, the Italian Ambassador in London made several enquiries (260663/16) as to whether His Majesty s Government were in occupation of the Farsan Islands, and this led to a correspondence between the [785] B‘2 Foreign Office and the India Office. In a letter to the Foreign Office, dated the 23rd December, 1916, the India Office made the following proposals:— “ Mr. Chamberlain greatly regrets that it had not been noticed here that no report had been received from the Government of India as to action taken on his telegram of the 4th June, 1915, and that the orders ot His Majesty s Government have in fact not been carried out. The situation which results is ambiguous and dangerous, and 1 am to suggest^ that . . . . the Britis i nag should be hoisted at once on the islands and left there. Lieutenant-Co onel Jacob should at the same time explain to the Idrisi Saiyid that this action has been taken in his behalf, and an agreement with him should be executed with the least possible delay, as directed by His Majesty’s Government m June 1915 “ It would also seem desirable to inform the Italian Government that all the islands in the Red Sea formerly under Turkish sovereignty natural 1 y pass to the Arab State and are covered by the protection extended to that St^te by the Anglo-French Agreement. It might further be pointed out that the Far_an Islands are in the occupation of the Idrisi Saiyid, whose territories Majesty’s Government are bound by treaty to safeguard, and that the British flag has been hoisted on them for the duration of the war in token of that obligation.” The Foreign Office agreed with these proposals, except as regards the suggested immediate communication to the Italian Government, and, with their concurrence, the following instructions were telegraphed by the India Office to the v iceroy on the 27th December, 1916:— “ Jacob should interview Idrisi as soon as possible and explain to him that if it is found necessary to hoist British flag on Farsan Islands this will have been done in pursuance of Article 5 of Ireaty of the 30th April. He should also press Idrisi to execute agreement as directed in my telegram ot the 4th June, 1915.” Accordingly, on the 29th December, 1916, the Resident instructed the commander of the British naval patrol off the Idrisi coast to inform the Idrisi that in accordance with Article 5 of the original agreement, the British flag was to be hoisted on the islands and an infantry detachment landed there, “ without prejudice to the Idnsi s rights of occupation ” (183/17), and that Colonel Jacob was coming to interview th! Idrisi at Jizan. On the same day (1426/17) the British flag was hoisted on Farsan Kebir Island, but the sheikh of the other island—Farsan beghir—would not allow this to be done without the Idrisi's written orders, and when Lieutenant Nalder proceeded to Jizan, the Idrisi would give him neither the required letter nor an interview (3073/17), but only a letter of protest addressed to the Resident A 1 •U' On the 1st January, 1917, Colonel Jacob landed a detachment on Farsan (Kebir?), and found that a hundred Idrisi troops were permanently stationed in Farsan village (2109/17). On the 7th January he interviewed the Idnsi at Jizan (93494/17) and submitted to him a draft supplementary agreement. 4he Idrisi accepted this, with the addition of an article stipulating that ‘ the Idrisi flag would be hoisted and remain permanently flying on the Farsan Islands ; but n xt day he sent a message that he was unable to sign the document. On the 8th Colonel Jacob wrote, in answer to this, that he could not alter the terms of Article 3 of his draft, providing that “ the Idrisi Saiyid engages not to cede, mortgage or surrender the Farsan Islands, or the places situate on his seaboard, or any rights therein to any foreign Power, and to call upon His Majesty’s Government to defend him it his rights therein are challenged from without.” Colonel Jacob further intimated ta the British flag and detachment would not be removed until the dratt agreement had been signed by the Idrisi. On the 9th January, however, the Idrisi sent Colonel Jacob a counter-draft, in which Article 3 of Colonel Jacob’s draft was i-clnd-d and in view of this, Colonel Jacob reported, on the 10th January, to the Resident at Aden as follows (10083/17):— „ “Idrisi quite ready to conclude supplementary agreement as outlined by Secretary of State. Refers to our treaty of April 1915, and our letter to him * Copy in 93494/17.of the 2sth February last and his reply, which virtually embodies present require ments. lie says Farsan part and parcel of his seaboard, and expects Ifritish protection from all outside interference. He says Britieh flag, however, as repugnant at Farsan as would be at Jizan, and likely to draw Turkish vengeance as implying cession of island to us; further, will preclude future favour qua arms from France and Italy. I fully sympathise in both arguments, and believe presence of cur flag will place Farsan in the category of annexations subject to post helium, adjudication. Idrisi flag and his 100 armed men, now present and to be retained, constitute effective occupation which should be notified. Would have completed agreement and removed our garrison, but cannot remove flag planted by admiral without prior reference. Will return to Jizan from Jeddah to do needful and await your orders.” The Resident repeated this telegram to the India Office on the 11th January, adding that he considered the occupation of the islands by the Idrisi to be effective, and recommending that the British garrison and flag should be removed. After receiving this telegram, the India Office telegraphed the following instruc tions to the Viceroy on the 15th January (14829/17:)— “ Our guard may be withdrawn at once. Jacob should meet Idrisi on return from Jeddah and negotiate agreement with him, on execution of which British flag may be hauled down. If thought necessary, Idrisi may be informed at once that this will be done.' Meanwhile, on the 13th January, Sir R. Wingate had telegraphed to the Foreign Office (10726/17)* submitting that the British garrison should not be withdrawn from the islands before an assurance had been obtained from the Idrisi that the occupation of them by another Power would at no time be permitted by him ; and this was communicated to the India Office on the 16th January (10083/17), with the suggestion that instructions might be sent to Aden in this sense. Sir R. Wingate s desideratum was, of course, already satisfied in the Idrisi s counter-draft, and the India Office, in a letter to the Foreign Office, dated the 18th January (14820/17), referred to the Resident’s telegram of the 11th January and to their telegram to the Viceroy of the 15th January (both quoted above), with the suggestion that no further instructions were necessary. The negotiations which had been resumed between Colonel Jacob and the Idrisi were therefore allowed to proceed, and on the 25th January the Resident at Aden telegraphed (21457/17) that the agreement had been signed on the 22nd and the British troops and flag removed from the Farsan Islands on the 23rd. . . . On the 29th January Prince Borghese made fresh enquiries at the loreign Ottice in regard to the status of the islands (20353/17). “ Prince Borghese was informed that orders had been issued as long ago as June 1915 for the British flag to be hoisted in the Farsan Islands. Owing, however, to some misunderstanding, this order had only recently been executed. The British flag had been hoisted and a small guard landed. But this action had only been taken on behalf of the Idrisi, whose authority over the islands was ,recognised by His IHajesty s Government. The islands had almost immediately been° handed over to him, the British flag had been removed, and the guard withdrawn. . , “ The above explanation appeared to satisfy Prince Borghese, who said that he was glad that the matter had been cleared up.' A copy of the Agreement as signed, together with a memorandum by Colonel Jacob, was forwarded by the Resident at Aden to the Government of India on the 26th January, 1917, and on the 17th February the Viceroy telegraphed on the sub ject as follows (39128/17):— “We consider that supplementary agreement concluded by Colonel Jacob with Idrisi, though not altogether satisfactory either in substance or in form, is doubtless best that could be secured in the particular circumstances and adequately meets the case. We propose, therefore, to approve it. There is no reference in it to Kamaran.” * Followed up by another telegram dated 19th January (15494/17). [785] CThe text of the Agreement is printed as an appendix to the present memoran dum. There was a further exchange of telegrams between the India Office and the Resident as to the significance, in the Arabic version, of the word rendered “ sup port in Article 4 (45134/17), but the Resident was able to assure the India Office that it meant no more than “necessary maintenance while in exile.” Accordingly, on the 28th February the India Office submitted the text to the Foreign Office with the following observations (45134/17):— ' It will be seen that, in order to obtain from the Idrisi the undertaking regarding the Farsan Islands, to which His Majesty’s Government attached great importance, Colonel Jacob found himself obliged to accept counter pro posals of a somewhat far-reaching nature. It is true that the protection of His Majesty’s Government is limited to the islands and seaboard; but it extends not only to the Idrisi himself, but also to his family, kinsmen, heirs and suc cessors, and it would seem that, while His Majesty’s Government are precluded from interfering in his affairs, they are bound to use every endeavour to restore him to his former condition if some purely internal disturbance should lead to his ejection from Asir. On the other hand, Article IV. appears to secure the control of the Arms Traffic and to give His Majesty’s Government an option as regards economic concessions which may prove useful vis-a-vis of other Powers ; and there seems to be nothing in the treaty that can reasonably be inter preted as entitling the Idrisi to any greater measure of support against the King of the Hejaz than he can already claim under Article V. of the Treaty of the 30th April, 1915. ' Mr. Chamberlain does not like the Agreement, as on paper, at any rate, it places very' serious obligations on His Majesty’s Government without exacting the condition that the Idrisi shall follow the advice that may be given him. But as the agreement has been made, and certain desiderata have been secured thereby, it may be politic to ratify it in due course and to trust to an opportunity hereafter occurring which will enable our relations with him to be placed on a more satisfactory footing.” In their reply, dated the 5th March, the Foreign Office concurred in these views, and, in a telegram of the 8th March, the India Office informed the Viceroy that ratification of the Agreement was approved (51827/17). On the 16th March they further communicated to him the Foreign Office letter of the 5th March, and laid down certain lines of future policy (68234/17):— “ It seems to be certain that at the conclusion of the war His Majesty's Government will be called upon, under Article V. of the Treaty of the 30th April, 1915, to arbitrate between the Idrisi Saiyid and the Imam Yahya, and in any case our relations with these two chiefs will need to be carefully defined, with reference both to British interests and to the interests of the Arab State.’ It is, therefore, probable that an opportunity' will be afforded of revising and consolidating the two agreements with the Idrisi, and in that event I request that the criticisms contained in India Office letter of the 28th February may be borne in mind. I would also remark that though the Idrisi orally ‘ scouted the idea of dealing with any Power save Great Britain,’ and professed to look to His Majesty’s Government for every form of assistance, the wording of Article IV. of the supplementary agreement does not prevent him from obtain ing arms and ammunition from any source he pleases. “ 1 request that Your Excellency will submit to His Majesty’s Government any draft which, when the time comes, you may propose to put before the. Idrisi.” . 1 Me; T''; r ile ’, the 9‘f e, ; nrnent of India had acted on the India Office telegram vr u an ' ^ iaf instructed the Resident at Aden as follows on the 10th March (81886/17):— “ Agreement concluded on the 22nd January, 1017, with Idrisi is approved by Governor-General in Council. Idrisi may be so informed. Ordinary ratifica tion could not well be made on single Arabic version. There appears; however, to te no need for this formality. When the time comes please bear in mind con cluding portion of Secretary- of State’s telegram ”t Relation of ( omiTiiitments to the Idvisi, unaev the Sv.jyplemcntoyry A qveement, to British Desiderata. The drawbacks of this Agreement are fully brought out in the India Office letters to the Foreign Office and the Viceroy, quoted above, but they would appear to be greatly outweighed by the advantages of the status of the Farsan Islands having been defined, and the Idrisi s sovereignty over them having been formally proclaimed in a document which can be advanced against any claims by other Powers. 1 he nai lative of the negotiations shows that fear of such claims was the origin ol the Agreement, and a claim to occupy the harsan Islands has now in fact been put forward by the Italian Government, in a memorandum, dated the 30th October, 1918, containing that Government’s demands “in application of article 13 of the iieaty of London of 1915, which was communicated to Ilis Majesty s Government on the 2nd Deoember last:— “ Italy, being one ol the Mussulman Powers bordering on the Red Sea, cannot remain indifferent to the question of the equilibrium of power in the Red Sea, and of the political conditions of Arabia, which faces Eritrea. We ask, therefore, that no Power shall occupy Arabia, that commerce and commercial penetration be free, that the Holy Places of Islam in Hedjaz be in Mussulman hands, and that the Farsan Islands upon the coast of A1 Asir be occupied by Italy.” Lhe occupation of the Farsan Islands by Italy would gravelv prejudice the political and strategic interests of Great Britain both in the Red Sea and on the Arabian mainland. Italy is already in possession of the Dahlak Archipelago and the port of Massowah on the African coast facing the Idrisi’s dominions, and if she held the Farsan group as well, she would command, at this point, the Red Sea route to India; while, as regards the mainland, she would use the Farsan Islands (as she intends, no doubt, to use the Dodekannese in the case of Anatolia) as a base for commercial and political penetration. Considering her former relations with the Idrisi over the Arms Traffic, this penetration might have some initial success; but in view of Italy's record in dealing with semi-eiviiised peoples, it may be prophesied that it would result before long in a conflict from which the Italians would emerge with discredit. Both phases would violently disturb the already precarious political equilibrium of the Arabian Peninsula, and would embarrass the Arabian policy of His Majesty’s Government. The exclusion of the Italians from the Farsan Islands is thus an important British interest, and the supplementary agreement with the Idrisi has placed the means of defending this interest in our hands. Under Article 7 of the Anglo-Franco- Italian Agreement of the 18th August, 1917, Italy was included in the terms of Article 10 of the Anglo-French Agreement of the ibth May, 1916, which provided that the signatories “ will not fhemselves acquire and will not consent to a third ” (now read “fourth ') “Power acquiring territorial possessions in the Arabian Peninsula, nor consent to a third ” (now read “ fourth ”) “ ‘Power installing a naval base either on the east coast, or on the islands, of the Red Sea.” The Italian memorandum of the 30th October, 1918, is obviously drafted with the intention of conforming to the terms of the 1917 Agreement, since it merely demands that “no Power shall occupy Arabia,” and the question of naval bases is evaded by the repetition of the colourless word “occupy” in the case of the islands. The claim to receive the Farsan Islands accordingly rests on the implied contention that they are not part of “Arabia,” in the sense intended irv the agreements, and before the conclusion of our supplementary agreement with the Idrisi this contention might plausibly Have been maintained. Now, however, that we are pledged to regard the islands as “ part and parcel of the Idrisi s domains, in all of which his independence is assured,” and “ to protect these islands from all hostile action,” we can lay down the doctrine that agreements relating to the Arabian Peninsula apply to the insular as well as the continental dominions of Arabian States or rulers. In taking our stand on this, we should be on very strong ground, and since the doctrine is of equally great importance to us in other parts of Arabia (for example, in the case of the islands belonging to the Sheikh of Koweit), it might be convenient to enunciate it at an early stage of the negotiations regarding the Arabian settlement. The doctrine would work out in our interests in every case, since where islands belong to mainland rulers, these rulers are already in political relations with us, whilethe islands which are politically separate from the mainland, and therefore fall outside the scope of our Arabian Agreements with our Allies and King Husein, iiyre also under our control. The Kuria Muria Islands are a British possession; Socotra actually and Bahrein virtually are British protectorates; and Kamaran Island, which lies off the Yemen coast in a commanding position between Loheia and Hodeida, neither is nor has been under Arab rule, but is (Ottoman territory occu pied by British forces during the war. In disposing of this island, we shall be free either to recognise the claims (if put forward) of whatever independent Arab sovereign is established, as a result of the eviction of the Turks, on the opposite coast of the Yemen mainland; or, alternatively, we can maintain that the succession of such Arab ruler is to Ottoman territory on the mainland only, and can annex Kamaran Island to the Aden Protectorate, as Ottoman territory conquered by us in the war. T j • • In general, therefore, the supplementary agreement with the Idrisi, whatever its shortcomings when considered by itself, has strengthened our hand very opportunely in the Arabian Peninsula and the Red Sea. APPENDIX TEXT OF SUPPLEMENTARY TREATY OF 22nd JANUARY, 1917 X. Tins agreement in no way annuls the conditions of the Treaty already concluded between the aforesaid Parties and dated the 30th April, 1915, a.d., corresponding to 15th Jumad al Thani, 1333, ah. • XX. His Majesty's Government recognise that the Farasan Islands have l&gt;een captured by the Idrisi Saiyid from the hands of the Turks, and have become part and parcel of the Idrisi’s domains, in all of which his index)endence is assured. XII. The Idrisi Saiyid engages not to cede, mortgage or surrender these islands nor the places situate on his seaboard, including the interests connected therewith, to any foreign Power, and further to call on His Majesty’s Government for assistance if these places or the interests therein are assailed or threatened from without. XV. His Majesty’s Government undertake to protect these islands and the Idrisi seaboard from all hostile action, without any interference on their part with his affairs and independence ; and again, in return for his engagement to preclude the intervention of any foreign Power in his territory or with its interests, His Majesty’s Government engage to afford the Idriei Saiyid the requisite help qua the sinews of war, such as'arms and ammunition and the like, both now during the duration of this general war and afterwards ; and to facilitate the necessary avenues to the acquisition by him of such^benefits as regards a telephone system and various developments such as the prospecting for mines and the extension of commerce and similar benefits; and further will vouchsafe his convenience and that of his followers in the choice of a secure asylum in the event of a crisis arising in his country which God forbid—together with such support of government as shall assure his dignity and well being, and shall use every endeavour to restore him to his former condition without any diminution therein. . . . y. The Idrisi Saiyid engages to keep a body of his armed retainers in the I arasan Islands as a token of his independence and to maintain his effective occupation therein. VX. —The Idrisi flag shall fly permanently over the Farasan Islands and in his other territories as a sufficient sign-visual of itself to all ships of his occupation, and this without any other ancillary token. VII. —The rights and duties of the Idrisi Saiyid detailed shall be extended to include his family, kinsmen, heirs and successors. VIII. —This agreement is signed by the Idrisi Saiyid on the one hand, and on the other by Lieutenant-Colonel H. F.
