She describes the university while she was a student, and explains how she received her undergraduate degree through an arrangement under which she completed two years at the American College for Girls before two years of study at AUC. She tells of her graduate studies in the United States toward a doctorate from Bryn Mawr College, and receiving financial support from AUC in return for her coming back to teach at the university. She asserts that she was one of the first Egyptian women to study abroad unaccompanied. Upon receiving her PhD in 1951 she began to teach philosophy at AUC, continuing for the next three decades; Said is considered the first full-time female faculty member at AUC. The place of philosophy in the curriculum, required as part of the Freshman Tutorial but attracting few majors, is discussed, as is Said’s reputation as a strict grader. She also offers observations on her colleagues in the English Department, where as philosophy professor Said was typically placed. Said describes students at AUC in her teaching years, including their family background (generally coming from families who could pay high tuition fees) and educational background. Said’s position as supervisor of women students is mentioned, along with her role as the supervisor for President Gamal Abdel Nasser’s daughter Mona, and she comments on female students’ later adoption of headscarf veiling. Said also briefly touches on major events affecting the university like the 1952 revolution, the 1956 Suez Crisis and the 1967 War, as well as faculty compensation issues.</dc:description><dc:subject>American University in Cairo--History.</dc:subject><dc:publisher>Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:publisher><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:format>oral histories (document genres)</dc:format><dc:source>AUC Oral Histories; Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:source><dc:rights>Copyright 2017, American University in Cairo.
