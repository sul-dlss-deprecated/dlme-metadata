(Most Confidential.) and shipping in the Persian Gulf, I am directed by the Board of Trade to forward to you herewith, for the consideration of Sir E. Grey, copy of a Memorandum which they have caused to be prepared dealing with certain questions raised bv Colonel Cox’s / i o T'* o t' r o ^ (Confidential.) THE despatch of Consul-General Cox to the Foreign Office, dated the 23rd July 1911, and the enclosed report, by Mr. Vice-Consul Chick, deal with German commercial activity in the Persian Gulf region during the year ended October 1910; and in particular direct attention to certain points in regard to which it is suggested that action might, and, if possible should, be taken by His Majesty’s Government. Further suggestions are contained in recent telegrams from Colonel Cox to the Commercial Intelligence Branch, and in a letter dated the 1st October from Mr. Chick to Mr. Worthington. Copies of these documents are appended. The present memorandum deals solely with these various proposals and the matters to which they relate ; and does not attempt to consider in any detail the general problem of German competition in the Gulf region. In the despatch of Colonel Cox mentioned above, attention was drawn to the importance of Antwerp as a port of call for German ships on their way to the Gulf, and to the fact that since 1908 of the British lines trading to the Gulf, only the West Hartlepool line calls at Antwerp. It is stated that this line is believed to be acting under some agreement with the Hamburg-America line in this respect. The exact position with regard to the Gulf shipping is certainly not clear. Some two^ or three years ago we were informed by Mr. Strick that the three British lines trading to the Gulf—his own (the Anglo-Algerian line, BucknalTs, and the West Hartlepool—formed a combine whose policy he controlled. The Bucknall line was weak, and the West Hartlepool line was relatively unimportant. This British combine had an agreement with the Hamburg-America line. Subsequently the Bucknall line was acquired by Sir John Ellerman, but Mr. Strick stated that he was to have charge of the Ellerman interests in the Gulf. In September 1910, Mr. Strick informed the Foreign Office that for reasons with which he was unacquainted, the Hamburg-America line had terminated the agreement or understanding. But it is noteworthy that whereas some time earlier he had declared his inability to engage in a freight war with the German line without Government assistance, he then (September 1910) professed indifference to any action which the German lines might take. Since then the board have heard nothing as to any change in the position, but the facts stated in the papers now under consideration, and other facts gathered by the commercial intelligence branch, are suggestive. ' ^ Comparing the two years ended in October 1909 aud 1910 respectively, it appears I have, &amp;c. GEO. J. STANLEY. Enclosure in No. 1. Memorandum by the Board of Trade respecting the Commercial Position in the Persian Gulf. 1. Shipping. that the sailings of the Hamburg-America line to the Gulf increased from nine to [2253 p—2] B C-tty jo INDIA 22 DEC 1911■ 1 ^ ■ tit v,,- ^ 2 ten (this latter number is smaller than in 1907 or 1908), the sailings of the Anglo- Algerian line from thirteen to eighteen ; of the Bucknall line from seven to fifteen; and of the West Hartlepool line from four to ten. (This is the largest number recorded since 1906 for this line. See table on p. 2 of Colonel Cox’s despatch.) It appears that of the three lust-mentioned lines only the West Hartlepool calls at Antwerp. The# paid-up capital of the West Hartlepool line is 410,000/. ; 16,000 10/. shares are held by Mr. Julius Guthe, chairman and managing director, who is a naturalised British subject, and Messrs. T. P. Guthe and Julius Guthe, Junr., are two out of the other three directors. It may therefore be assumed that the elder Mr. Guthe has, directly or indirectly, a controlling interest. The company has paid no dividend since 1907. Its debentures stand at 70. In March last it had a debit balance of 23,000/. The sailings are from Middlesbrough, with calls always at Antwerp. From enquiries made by the commercial intelligence branch, it appears that the company has no connection with any other British lines, and is stated to be ignored by them. It seems obvious that, assuming the above statement correctly represents the facts, the West Hartlepool line cannot be going to Antwerp in competition with the Hamburg- America line, and there would appear to be at least a possibility that the opinion expressed by Colonel Cox and Mr. Chick as to an arrangement between the two lines may be correct. (The statement of the firm in their letter to the Foreign Office, of which copy was sent to the Board of Trade on the 31st October, does not necessarily conflict with this.) The situation certainly seems unsatisfactory, but it does not appear possible to get at the actual facts, without direct enquiry of Mr. Strick, and it may be doubted if he would be willing to give any definite information. In any event we know that as he had secured contracts in respect of general trade from England and sugar from Marseilles, and has now control of the Hormuz oxide deposits, he is satisfied with his position, and would only be willing to engage in a conflict with the Hamburg- America line, and an attack upon their continental trade, in return for a substantial subsidy, which it has already been decided could be defended only on political grounds. Light is thrown on Mr. Strick’s general attitude by his reply to the communications made to him by the Commercial Intelligence Branch, in consequence of the telegram from Colonel Cox of the 27th September, urging that an attempt should be made to induce Mr. Strick to cancel or suspend the recent increase of homeward freights for grain earned by the lines under his control, which is said to render the competition of British hrms with the German firm impossible. The reply is simply to the effect that the increase is perfectly reasonable, and cannot possibly have any harmful effect, and we do not appear to be in a position to controvert this, or to‘offer Mr. Strick any inducement to modify his policy. 2. The Sugar Trade. Colonel Cox and Mr. Chick draw attention to the efforts of the Germans to dominate the sugar trade in the Gulf, and to the fact that the exports of suo-ar to the Cult form an important part of the cargoes from Antwerp. The possibility of an attempt to capture any part of this trade by sending British ships to Antwerp—other t an the West Hartlepool line, which carries a large amount of sugar—has been dealt vut above; it is possible also that the Belgian refinery from which the sugar comes has ma e ong-penod contracts in respect of freight, in which case it would not be possible to divert the traffic. ^ regards the trade in sugar from Marseilles, as to which it is asserted (p. 6 of Colonel Cox s despatch) that the carriage will soon be in the hands of the Hamburg- menca me, i must be pointed out that the only Marseilles refinery shipping to the Gulf is under contract to ship only by the Anglo-Algerian and Bucknall lines, and cannot do otherwise for some time to come without breaking the contract. (Mr. Strick’s letter to Foreign Office, of the 10th August, 1911.) V With respect to the sugar trade generally, it may be remarked that the Board of tbpv- 6 ave ® ucce . e e 111 interesting Messrs. Tate in the matter, and understand that Th q y, lte r . e 1°! lm P? rtai ice. It is not apparent that anything else can be done. p ? U - les 111 16 that the Persian demand is mainly for loaves, which are not for hntl. ^ an ^ nAeq Kingdom refinery, though they are made by Belgian refineries maol • r ^ ome an export trades. The manufacture of loaves requires special the marniffl ^ 2 * * S ^ e( fr arran g em ents for drying, and is a considerably longer process than anufacture of tablets or cubes, and the Persian market alone is so small that there isvery little inducement fur British firms to take up this branch of the manufacture. Messrs. Tate, however, are hopeful of some success in their venture of pushino- the sale of their cubes. 3. Banking Facilities. In the letter of the 1st October, 1911, from the British consulate-general at Bush ire to Mr. Worthington, complaint is made of the difficulties experienced by British firms there in obtaining money from the local branch of the Imperial Bank of Persia. The exact nature of the difficulty is not quite clear. When a firm in an Eastern port desire to ship produce, they usually arrange with a Eondon bank for a credit available by drafts in sterling, the documents representing the shipments having to be sent to the bank. WTen a credit has been received by a firm, if they are not possessed of large means, they apply to the bank’s local branch or agent for an advance in local currency against deposit of the produce to be shipped in a warehouse in the bank’s name; when shipment is completed, the drafts are drawn under the credit at the rate of excnange previously arranged. If a number of such credits, or a large credit has been granted, it may make currency scarce locally, and the bank may find it necessary to raise the rate ot exchange to such a point as will give relief by enabling them to bring in fresh supplies. In such action the bank would doubtless always have in view the interests of all its local clients; they would all have to suffer in the rate of exchange, but, so far as the bank could arrange, they would all have supplies of currency; and a firm that could not obtain their usual supply (or at least a supply fully proportionate to their credits) because some other firm happened to have an unusually large credit on London, would have a legitimate cause for complaint. It may, however, be that in the present case the German firm made a contract with the bank for a large advance in krans in Bushire without reference to a sterling credit, such advance being either a specified amount or sufficient to cover the firm’s require ments. Though it is unlikely that the bank would make such a contract without taking precautions against possible difficulties arising therefrom, it may be that the contract was for a larger sum than was prudent, and that the bank found themselves unable to furnish the usual facilities to their other customers, who would consequently suffer not from unfair treatment, but from an error of judgment on the part of the bank. It would probably be possible to make confidential enquiries into the matter on this side, and, if necessary, to convey to the bank in the same manner a warning as to the undesirability of any suspicion as to the preferential treatment of foreign firms in the Persian trade. 4. Other matters. (a.) Trading Policy of the German Firm .—In the letter of the 1st October to Mr. Worthington, reference is made to the practice of the German firm’s agents at Bushire of making advances to the tribesmen, rprobably against growing crops or crops not even planted. This kind of proceeding is probably the main cause of the develop ment of Messrs. Wdnckhaus’s trade on the Gulf; it would undoubtedly give them great influence with the natives; but it is highly speculative, and the British firms would doubtless be unwilling to compete in this way with Messrs. Wonckhaus, nor could they be expected to do so. The British firms probably make some advances, but they would j not be prepared to make them on the extensive scale which appears to be adopted by their German competitors. (b.) Financial Resources of the German Firm .—It is understood that the state ments in the paragraphs on p. 9 of Colonel Cox’s despatch bearing on this subject are substantially correct, and that in 1910, Mr. Otto Beit, who had some connection with the Hamburg firm of Traun, Sturcken, and Co., did take the place of this firm as a “ commanditaire ” partner with Messrs. Wonckhaus. It is doubtful, however, if the Foreign Office or Board of Trade could take any action in this matter which would be likely to meet with any success. (c.) Tugs and River Craft .—There seems to be no information in the possession of the Board of Trade as to the alleged intention of the Germans to take tugs to the Gulf, and we have not heard anything recently of the schemes for dealing with lighterage at Bussorah. Should the Germans be allowed to use their own boats for the conveyance of railway material up the Tigris to Bagdad—which they might quite probably desire to do—it might be difficult to get them off the river when the railway is completed to Bagdad, or even afterwards when it has reached the Gulf; and this, [2253 p—2] B 2and still more the suggested transference of the Turkish boats to the Germans which, however, is now perhaps unlikely—would strengthen the German position and prestige there greatly. 5. Conclusions. * So far as the evidence in the papers now under consideration goes, it does little more than strengthen the conclusions reached in previous examinations of this problem, namely, that the efforts to build up German trade and shipping interests on the Gulf are being made, and are likely to continue, without very much regard for the immediate financial results, and are directed probably to the creation of apparent economic interests which can serve as the basis for political claims. It is apparent also that these efforts are meeting with some measure of success, and there is little likelihood that the unsound methods adopted—unsound when regarded from a purely commercial point of view— will, however large the resultant losses, drive German enterprises from the Gulf. It is also certain that the British firms will not compete with the Germans by adopting their methods; there is little evidence (except possibly in the present case of grain- buying) that they are feeling German competition at all keenly ; on commercial grounds British ship-owners will not enter into a conflict with the Hamburg-America line, nor is there any reason (from their point of view) why they should do so. Begarding the whole question from the commercial standpoint, however regrettable some of the facts may be, there is noj ^e shown for interven tion by His Majesty’s Government, even if some useful form of intervention - on purely’cbmmercial hnes~could be devised. From the political standpoint there may conceivably be serious reason for action by His Majesty’s Government, but the decision as to the need and nature of such action does not rest with the Board of Trade.

We understand that space by the Hamburg-America Company’s steamers is fully oo e up o ic end of the year, and, consequently, any alteration we might make inour rates of freight would have no effect on the quantities carried or the freights charged by the Hamburg-Am erica line steamers during that period.

Endeavour effect suspension Strick and Co.’s action till then.—Cox. (5.) Consulate-General, Bushire, to Board of Trade. (Confidential.) My dear Mr. Worthington, Bushire, October 1, 1911. I think we ought to keep you informed of the present state of German com petition here, which has lately begun to assail the British position in a way which -causes us some anxiety, and, with Colonel Cox’s approval, I place the following observations before you :— During 1909 and 1910 the position as far as Bushire and Mohammerah (Persian ports) were concerned, was that R. Wonckhaus and Co. had no permanent German representative at either port, and were doing practically no other business than land the Ham burg-America cargoes once a month. Robert Wonckhaus has dissolved partnership with his Hamburg friends, and was looking for support elsewhere ; unfortunately he found it in London, with Mr. Otto Beit {vide your letter dated the 17th August, 1910), and that development seems to have altered the whole aspect of affairs. As stated in the report on the German lines operations for October 1909-10 (No. 6, Commercial, of the 27th July, 1911), Wonckhaus and Co. opened large credits in the beginning of this year with several German banking firms and with Martin s Bank in London. There were usually favourable opportunities for buying grain here and at Mohammerah this year, and they at once started buying largely. Aided by the specially low rates of freight which they enjoy from the Hamburg— America line, which 1 have lately been told on the most reliable authority are always 5s‘. less than those quoted by the British lines, and with the above-mentioned credits at then disposal they have been able to ride roughshod over all other buyers. It is obvious that with such such a margin as 5s. per ton they can force prices up above the limit of Butish At the present there are about five British firms here buying for the London market; it is sufficient that a British firm has named its price for a parcel of wheat for the German agent to cap it immediately by as much as ^ kran per cwt. (approximately) or higher. The German agents (the firm has two men here now) simply pass down the whaif andbuy everything. They have always a crowd of tribesmen in the office, to whom they make advances ; the German also have a number of agents buying for them at the small district ports. Apart from the above-mentioned handicap to British firms, scarcity of current coin for purchases was beginning to affect the operations of all European firms ; thtJ0 w bank having an insufficient supply, while the German credits came to an end a few weeks ago. Aided by a British institution, the Imperial Bank of Persia, in London, the German firm, however, freed themselves from the difficulty by getting their London friends to open a new large credit for them in krans at Bushire. The result is that the branch of the bank here cannot now spare the British firms any money at all, until the German firm have been satisfied. No doubt the Imperial Bank in London were unaware, when they accepted this German business, of the unfortunate position in which it would place the British firms and its office here. We are now trying to get the firms money by other means. Thirdly, the British steamer companies choose the present moment to raise freights on wheat at Bushire by 2s. 6d., i.e., just sufficient to make purchases too risky for cautious British firms at the present “ German ” prices. Colonel Cox has already telegraphed for your assistance in preventing this from taking effect, and I now enclose copy of a letter of the 23rd September, which I wrote to the agents here (at the request of buyers). If freights are raised to 205., the Germans are likely to remain in possession of the field alone. The amount of our wheat business may seem small to you, but it is a large item in this part of the world. I give you the above details for you to judge of the effect of German competition. I doubt whether the British shipping companies quite understand the position. If the German firm by virtue of the 5s. rebate has the bulk of trade in the wheat export in its hands, it will mean that it will acquire this year a unique position in the eyes of the natives of the town and in the whole district, to the disparagement of British trade. . Some British firms (including Messrs. Gray, Paul, and Co.) are now talkino- of asking the Germans to form a combine to fix prices; the fact of half-a-dozen British firms, some of long standing, asking one German firm to come to terms with them is sufficient to show how British prestige is likely to suffer ; and. from what I know of German overtures m that direction at the beginning of the year, the Germans will hardly now be content with less than one-third or one-half of the wheat purchased and ull the barley. In either case, the British commercial position at Bushire vis-d-vis a single German firm is likely to suffer, and at the present juncture, when one does not know what is going to happen in Southern Persia, there seems to be a danger in having the Germans claiming that they have an important commercial interest in the district, as the result of subsidised competition. One of the most influential Persian merchants warned me this week that the German firm was adopting these tactics for the sole end of obtaining influence in the district for political purposes. I want to ask whether there is no possibility of Government intervening to assist our firms to compete effectively. &amp; Grain being an exceptional article in which a small difference in freight means a great deal, could not the Board of Trade see their way to recommend t\J the British thTnoBir^- 8 ^ 0 grant of , mone y&gt; {'} compensation for giving shipments to knerica line ? sd ° m fl '° m PerSla a reI:,ate Slmll ar to that allowed by the Hamburg- BritJh Tw/W ^ nothing to be done with Mr. Otto Beit-he is presumably a trade here J If be G 18 promoting an attack on the position of British Wbh'nrjl 5 f f P°f tlon to could he not be given a hint to do so ?

No applications for coin had been received from British houses, and as a matter of fact, it would have been impossible to send coin to Bushire owing to the state of the roads. Sir Thomas went on to say in confidence that had he been in London, he should have hesitated to comply with the application. When asked what Messrs Wonckhaus would have done, and whether, if he had placed difficulties in their way, it would not give an Impetus to the establish ment of a German bank in the Gulf, Sir T. Jackson re plied that it would undoubtedly do so, and added that when he was in Hong Kong, he had for many years prevent ed the establishment of a German bank there by always showing readiness to accomnodate German customers.

Chick, on German Trade and shipping for the fourth year of the Hamburg-Amerika Company’s sailings, ending October 1910. His last report was forwarded with my covering despatch No. 4-Commercial, dated 8th June 1910. Two main facts, in a great measure dependent upon one another, stand out prominently in the Report : — (i) The marked progress attending German efforts to capture and control the Sugar Trade to the Persian Gulf. (ii) The important factor in their success represented by the use of Antwerp as an export base. Presuming that when the Anglo-Persian Oil Company have their oil ready for shipment German steamers will no longer find it profitable to bring kerosene to the Gulf, the sugar trade will be their principal standby ; it \s consequently all important to us to devise means of offering effective competition in respect of this commodity, and the figures and facts furnished by Mr. Chick clearly indicate that the use of Antwerp by the British lines is greatly to be advocated, both in connection with the sugar trade and other items of continental export ; but as to what the precise position is at present among the companies inter se and how Jar it may now be feasible from their point of view to resume the call at the Belgian port I have no information. In the above connections I venture, with the highest respect, to suggest that the Board of Trade be asked to convene a small conference of shippers and ship-owners to discuss both questions and advise as to the possibilities and most effective means of improving our position. As regards Bahrain and Lingah it is still in our local opinion important that the Anglo-Algerian Company should arrange regular_ calls at each port. In spite of previous hints they have so far taken no steps in this direction in regard to Bahrain, and I can well believe that they have been deterred partly by the absence of satisfactory mail or telegraphic communication with the islands. If however, as there seems reason to hope, we shall before long see Bahrain connected with the other Gulf ports by wireless, this objection would disappear. Perhaps a knowledge of the intentions of Government in this direction would be encouraging to them. As regards Lingah I was glad at a recent visit to that port to gather that Messrs. Gray Paul and Company, who, stimulated by the appointment of a^ British Vice-Consul, at length decided to locate one of their European staff at this port, find that the measure is having satisfactory results.2 The news of the probably early commencement of the Baghdad-AIeppo Sec tion of the German Railway from the Baghdad end indicates a development of far-reaching importance, which will clearly be of the greatest advantage to the Hamburg-Amerika Line. As regards the point raised by Messrs. Lynch’s manager in respect to German rights of navigation on the Tigris it would seem unlikely that the Germans would forego the opportunity of placing their own vessels and employes on the Shat-al-Arab and Tigris for the transport of material • but, if the statement that the Turkish River Company is to be transferred to German management is correct, a position is likely to be created which could hardly be regarded by Messrs. Lynch and British interests in general with equanimity. Whereas this report deals with a period ending October 1910, I venture to explain that the material on which the statistics are based takes a considerable time to collate and necessitates correspondence with outside offices. Report on German Shipping and Trade in the Persian Gulf {for the period October iqoq to October 1910.) The period under report coincides with the fourth year of the sailings of the Hamburg-Amenka Line to the Persian Gulf, in competition with the British lines from the United Kingdom, which had previously held a practical monopoly of the Shipping trade to the Gulf ports and Shat-al-Arab. As compared with the regular British lines, the number of sailings to the Gulf by the German Shinoinpr company have been :— ^ — Oct. 1906-07 . 1907*08. 1908-09. 1909*10.

Importance of Antwerp as a port of Shipment for the Gulf. For some time past I have formed the opinion that the German Shipping t ‘ p rlenends more on the cargo which it ships from Antwerp to t e u same time that most in demand in the regions around the Gulf. I. '11 K» rprnllerted that previous to 1908 the Anglo- Algerian and Bucknall 'V'lL n rused frequenL -^11 in at Antwerp, though the export of Lu es to the Gull used q y British steamers for instance ^ iro ' “ d London. . . ., ,'n &gt;908 the Hamburg.Amerika e ^^t^rit^ c^fer- f rG h^l '“Urn calling at Antwerp, and I' ^ itertened a freight war. The German line, one of the most powerful further threatened a treig ^ the British lines&gt; receiving no financial sup- German lines, was State , contest and save way. Since then, port from the British f t 0 ^™^S 0 ol Company, w S hich disassociated them- Lt^tmThT Colhme^nd mTde,' 1 und JstanS special terms with the Hamburg-Amerika, have called at Antwerp at all regularly.

J We know also that out of a total 157,673 packages imported by the Ger man line to Basrah in 19m, 74,641 packages were loaf and crystal sugar from Antwerp to Basrah and 23,075 packages from Antwerp for Baghdad nearly 1 o,oqo tons in all. ^ ’ 3 The Basrah figures for British vessels would probably be still more striking but, added to the fact that none of the 3 British Companies send vessels to Bahrain, that Lingatys seldom visited, the Bushire figures are sufficient to show that these two British lines are now quite out of the running for Belgian sugar as compared with the German line. &amp; s * There remains the West Hartlepool Line, which loaded 21,657 packages Sugar at Antwerp, but this line is managed by an Anglo-German and I gather that they are under some agreement with the Hamburg-Amerika Line in this respect: so if they are only acting subsidiarily to the German Company’s per mission, the position is highly unsatisfactory. r j v As stated in the report on the 3rd year of sailings, it is a very great “ de sideratum ” for the British “ Shipping Lines to resume their calls to Antwerp for t Gulf cargo.’ It would be important as well as of great interest to learn from Lxovernment what is the exact position between the Hamburg-Amerika Line and Messrs Strict (the Anglo-Algerian Company, Ellermans and Bucknalls) as regards Antwerp. ' From information supplied to the Foreign Office by Messrs. Strict in Sen- ember 1910 it would appear that the German Company suddenly terminated the unwritten agreement under which they were working with him If there k np agreement, what is to prevent the steamers of Messrs. Strict and associated Companies resuming calls at Antwerp ? a ™ f S !f Ir ! g ^ neal £ a11 , M o an chester shippers are understood to be under contract to Messrs. Strick &amp; Co., and comparatively little besides sugar goes from London direct, it is presumed that Messrs. Strick &amp; Co. would be in as little danger from any retaliation by the German Company, as the German Company would be if Messrs. Strick sent their vessels to Hamburg. . \ { this is not the reason why Messrs. Strick &amp; Co. still abstain from send- »ng steamers to Antwerp, is it that the German line has a special agreement whh the Raffinene Tirlemontoise,” or such brokers of its sugar as th? Societe de 1 Exportation des Sucres, and that British vessels, even if they went there would obtain very little sugar ? ^ ere ’ questions put to Messrs Czarnikow’s broker and others I understand that they try if possible to arrange for shipments of Belgian sugar to the Persian 't \ 17 t Gulf to be sent to London for transhipment to the British lines : but in many eases owing to date of shipment required, and other reasons there is no alter native but to let the sugar go out in the German line. ' On account of the dimensions that the sugar trade is likely to assume in the near future up the valley of the Tigris and possibly the Karun—in 1910 the quantity to Basrah increased by 79,814 bags loaf = £138,573,—and owing to the fact that the “ Raffinerie Tirlemontoise ” is one of the very few refineries which keep up the special machinery for moulding the sugar-cones preferred in this region, I would attach a great importance to the British lines calling regularly at Antwerp. Later on Antwerp cargo may become of less comparative value to the German line, but it will never do in this early stage of competition in the Gulf trade for the British lines to be driven out of the Antwerp trade. Before leaving this subject I will briefly recapitulate the position of the Sugar trade in the Gulf, and German connection with it. Loaf-sugar is imported in very much larger quantities than crystal sugar. The principal refineries of loaf-sugar dealing with this part of the world have been: Raffinerie Tirle montoise in Belgium: Raffineries de St. Louis near Marseilles; the refinery of U. Z. J. sugar at Szerencs in Hungary. Up to 1906 nearly a)) the import into Southern Persia consisted of Marseil les sugar, |but in 1906 the Belgian sugar appeared on the market and owing to its cheapness and the employment of certain trade devices began to make headway round the Gulf littoral. For the past year or two the import of Marseilles sugar has dropped a great deal, and is destined chiefly for Central Persia, while the Hungarian refinery has, it would appear, ceased working. The British steamer companies have held for a number of years a contract with Marseilles Refineries for the shipment of all sugar to the Gulf, but this is, I believe, near expiry. It may be more than a coincidence that the Belgian Refinery began opera tions in the Gulf (which presumably meant the installation of special plant) in the same year that the Hamburg-Amerika started their sailings to the Gulf, and Messrs. Wonckhaus extended their agencies. A reference to Sir W. Ward’s letter to the Foreign Office of September 9th, 1907, shows from his summary of the Trade Report of the German Consul at Baghdad that the latter significantly remarked that; “a brisk export trade in Belgian sugar has already been opened between Antwerp (where the Hamburg-Amerika line steamers call on their out ward and homeward voyages) and the Persian Gulf: but the sugar export trade from Marseilles is likely to remain, at all events for some time to come, in the hands of the British steamship companies running to the Persian Gulf, as they have made contracts for some years in advance with the Marseilles sugar refineries for the transport of their products to those ports.” That was in 1907: the position now is that the Belgian refinery holds the principal position, the Marseilles refineries the second : the export of Belgian sugars is in the hands of the German line, and of a weak and doubtfully inde pendent British line: the brands of crystal and soft sugar preferred in this region are also exports from Hamburg. Now—lately—the Agent of Messrs. Wonckhaus in conversation with a Pe^in merchant is reported to have said that the contracts with the Marseilles Sugar Refineries would shcjjtly be taken over by the Hamburg-Amerika Company, and then all the Sugar Trade would be in German hands. (N. B. No less than 46,900 packages out of 75,512 packages total cargo brought by 25 steamers of the British lines to Bushire during the year were Marseilles sugar: whence the importance of these contracts). Further, on good authority it is stated that correspondence has passed in 1910 and 1911 between the German firm and Marseilles loaf-sugar exporters; and that in one of their last letters Messrs. Wonckhaus and Company wrote that if Marseilles will ship sugar exclusively by the German line, reduced freights will be granted and the firm will accept all responsibility for shortages. The evidence appears sufficiently strong to show that the Germans are making efforts to control the import of sugar to the Persian Gulf: and this canonly be prevented by all British interests concerned—Shipping companies, sugar brokers, the principal British firms in the Persian Gulf and friendly foreign refin eries uniting. I doubt if the first-named realize the increased activity of the Germans in this direction: and though perhaps a great deal ought to be done with British and Colonial refined sugar, some sort of system will need to be adopted to popularize it, and it cannot be expected in any case entirely to an swer the growing wants of these regions. Kerosene .—The import of Galician kerosene is unlikely to grow : and is in fact considerably less than in former years. I am informed that the Anglo- Persian Oil Company’s oil may be expected on the market about February next, and it is hoped that the oil will be sufficiently good to replace all foreign kerosene, at a much cheaper rate, and thus drive the Hungarian product out of the market, incidentally depriving the German line of 2,000—3,000 tons of import cargo per annum. ^ EXPORTS. Turning to exports from the Gulf during the period under review, the following are the results compared with those of previous years :— — 1906-7 1907-8 1908-9 1909-10 Packages Packages. Packages.

The average weight of cargo borne on the homeward voyage was thus 1^12 tons. The nett tonnage of 8 of the 11 Hamburg-Amerika vessels ranged between and 1,830 tons : a steamer of 2,095 tons made the remaining 3 voyages. The dead weight tonnage or carrying capacity—for these 11 ships may be put down at an average of 4,500 tons each. It is obvious therefore that the ships either went home more than half empty, or had to pick up cargo in ports outside the Gulf. Besides the one vessel that proceeded with dates to New York and met with an accident in the Atlantic, and an extra steamer of the Deutsche-Austral Line which took dates from Basrah to Australia, it is known that 2 of the vessels loaded on the Indian9 and Ceylon coast, and probably several others likewise: for it is reported that the Hamburg-Amerika line, after loading as much as possible in each steamer, go away to the Malabar coast, where they are said to be under an agreement with the Hansa line for alternate sailings. A high rate of freight is said to attract them, and by only partially filling their vessels they avoid the expense and delay of lighterage at the Bar. Produce for export was scarce in the Gulf from the autumn of 1909 up to July 1910 owing to the failure of previous harvests, and when the poor results of the first tfiree years’ sailings are borne in mind, it is evident that the German steamship Company do not mind running at a loss over an extended period, and are determined to maintain a regular connection, in order to be able to claim a vested interest in the Gulf of Shat-al-Arab trade, i.6. t for political reasons— 7 w hich presupposes that a subsidy exists. Otherwise ; what business-like Ship ping Company would maintain an expensive fleet,—even to the extent of pur chasing two larger vessels from Messrs. Strick &amp; Co.,—for a part of the world where Germany has had no vested interests, where there is not even a moderate quantity of import or export trade with Germany, where there is but a single German firm, their own protegd and, to all intents, the sole shipper by the line,— all for an average import cargo of 2,500 tons, and export cargo of 2,000 tons per voyage ? Messrs. R. Wonckhaus &amp; Co'.s business and connection with the Line.

Total 71,446 &gt;&gt; Incidentally also it may be mentioned that British firms, chiefly Hindu traders at Bandar Abbas, imported by the line not less than 17,284 packages: iron bars, matches and 3,350 bags Belgian sugar by Messrs. Ziegler formed the principal items. From February ig\o till after the end of the year under report, Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. remained without a German agent at Bushire, and little business was done: at Bandar Abbas also they have so far not established a German representative. Their financial business through the Imperial Bank of Persia at Mohammerah from April till December 1910 only amounted to 30,300 tomans (^5,509), and ^309 only in duties had been paid to the Persian Cus toms there. Mohammerah.—Messrs. Wonckhaus only began shipping exports and buying grain in Mohammerah from the end of September 1910 onwards: previously the steamers did not stop at that port on their downward voyage: from that month onwards they became very busy, buying at prices far above English limits, and taking advantage of the exceptional harvest of 1910. Bushire .—Mention was made in the previous report that Messrs. Won- ckhaus’ broker and the Persian Mirza of the German Consulate had been large importers of arms at Maskat for subsequent smuggling to Tangistan, and that the former had suffered financially from the blockade, and had been called upon to meet bills from Germany. During his tenure as representative of the German firm at Bushire, in September 1910, he sent 8,500 tomans (^1,545) of the firm’s money in coin in a native boat to buy grain a little distance along the coast. The boatmen afterwards stated that their craft had sunk, and the coin been lost, but suspicions were aroused that the broker was implicated in the disappearance of the coin. Mr. Brown, managing partner of the firm at Basrah, arrived to investigate the accounts and enquire into the affair, and the broker finding him self discredited and pressed for money absconded into the hinterland, saddling the German firm with a heavy loss. Ling ah. —Messrs. Wonckhaus’ methods at Lingah, as agents for the ship ping line, had been characterized for a long time by highhandedness towards the Persian Customs, and British shippers, while reliable reports received left it hardly open to doubt that they took advantage of their private bonded warehouse to smuggle when opportunity offered. Financial business of Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co .—On October 1st the Commanditaire partnership between Herr Wonckhaus and Herrn Traun, Sturcken &amp; Co. in Hamburg came to an end, and the business was then carried on by Herr Wonckhaus as sole partner with a capital of about ^20,000. Herr Wonck haus was reported to be seeking English capital, and Mr. Otto Beit’s name was very confidentially mentioned as willing to advance the firm £50,000 for 10 or 12 years. The Director of the Commercial Intelligence Branch also stated inthis connection that “ Messrs. Wonckhaus’ Persian Gulf business is said to have been very prosperous, and with additional financial facilities, the business is capable of greater development.” It is to be regretted if this firm, presumably merely a weapon of the Deutsche Bank, Hamburg-Amerika Line and German policy in connection with the Bagh dad railway terminus, is being financed from London. Though anticipating the report for October 1910-11 it is interesting to note, in connection with their financial arrangements, that the following credits were stated from Basrah to have been granted to Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. in January 1911 :— ^30,000 from the Deutsche Bank, Berlin ; ^'30,000 from the Deutsche Oriental Bank, Berlin Dresdner Bank, Berlin Ferdinand Jacobs, Hamburg ; £ 10,000 from the Martin’s Bank, London ; in drafts of 4 months’ usance, payable in London. Also in February 1911, Lorn German banks. Mohammerah and the Gulf ports are apparently largely financed from Basrah. This money is now (1911) being utilized in the purchase of grain, for which specially favourable conditions are prevailing up the Tigris and Karun, and dong the Persian littoral. The Germans are buying, at higher prices than British firms can afford, any and all grain, more particularly barley, put on the wharves, and their one preoccupation is to fill these German ships. The shipping hne is believed to allow them a rate of freight considerably reduced below the i^s. 6d. now charged by the British lines on wheat. German line and the Baghdad Railway.—k report that the Hamburg- Amerika steamers would soon be bringing out^ railway material to Baghdad having emanated from the German office in Bushire, enquiries were made from the Resident at Baghdad and Messrs. Lynch as to how the transport of this material would be effected, and how British shipping on the Tigns^ might be affected. Mr. Lorimer states that from a conversation which he had with Meiss ner Pasha at Aleppo,and subsequent information it would appear that, after the survey is made and 'the alignment approved, construction of the Aleppo-Baghdad section will begin from both ends simultaneously. According to Messrs. Lynch s own information the railway material will arrive at Basrah as soon as the pians are finally decided upon, but it is not known yet whether negociations have been opened with the Nahrieh as to its transport. Under the railway concession the German Company seem to have the privilege of bringing up the material on their own river craft. Messrs. Lynch’s manager raises the question whether recent chancres in the arrangements with the Turkish Government regarding the propos- ed Gulf section of the railway will have affected this privilege or not. It is obvious that the position of the Hamburg-Amenka Line will be strengthened by the acquisition of this heavy additional cargo : on the other hand the introduction of German craft on the Tigris, nominally for transport of railway material alone, may in the sequel conceivably prejudice both Messrs. Lynch s concessionary rights, and also aid the Germans, with their system of rebates of railway and sea-freights, to place German exported merchandize on the Baghdad and Western Persian markets cheaper than goods travelling by English ships. According to a statement made by one of Wonckhaus’ agents to His Majesty s Consul at Mohammerah the Germans are about to bring out 6 small tugs to the Gulf, but whether as river boats for the purpose indicated above, or for lighterage purposes is not yet known. A rather startling statement has however been made in the German office at Bushire and in the presence of a British shipping agent by the master ot the Hamburg-Amerika S. S. “ Nicomedia” to the effect that the Germans wou d be shortly taking over the Turkish River Company’s boats, and then there would be good openings for German masters in these craft.12 Statistics .—Details of Imports and Exports by the Line to the various ports are attached. No new types of goods are to be noticed. As regards German velvets it may be mentioned that the German samples were brought to the notice of Messrs. Ziegler and Co., Messrs. Elson and Neill of Manchester, and Messrs. Lister of Bradford during the summer of 1910: but it is doubted whether they will take any specific action to oust German goods. Beer. —Messrs. Allsoppand Messrs. Tennent have since the previous report interested themselves in the market, and there are English beers now in opposi tion to the German. Crystal Sugar .—The British sugar sent on trial to the Gulf market by Messrs. Henry Tate and Sons, as the result of arrangements between the Board of Trade, Messrs. F. C. Strick and Co. and themselves, had done well in the year under report and Messrs. Tate expressed themselves very satisfied. But the specially reduced shipping rates cannot be utilized for Bahrain, Kuwait and Lingah where Messrs. Strick’s vessel do not call: and the lower price of E. A. R. Austrain sugar often makes it difficult to obtain buyers for the British crystals. With some more organization, in which the Consulate-General would willingly assist, and an extension of shipping facilities to the other ports, Messrs. Tate ought to be able to build up a large trade. Iron Bars .—Besides Basrah, the import was nearly all for Bandar Abbas, shipped for Hindu firms by Messrs. Forbes, Forbes, Campbell and Co. of London and Karachi. I have asked this firm both verbally in London last year, and now again in writing if it is possible for them to avoid shipments by the German line and more especially if they can replace the Swedish iron from Antwerp by British iron. Matches .—The sulphur matches most in vogue in the Gulf are apparently manufactures of the Swedish Match Combine with which the Hamburg-Amerika Line has a special freight agreement at Antwerp. So far our efforts to discover a British sulphur match, or, failing that^ Swedish matches not in the hands of the Combine which could be introduced to compete, have been unsuccessful. Synthetic Indigo .—Indian indigo seems to be losing ground before the German article, of which 366 packages were imported to the Persian ports in the year under review, an increase on previous years. Indian exporters appear to take no steps to make arrangements with the principal importers of indigo, including such firms as Messrs. Ziegler and Co. and prices of the better quality Indian dyes are dearer than the German product.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Government.] V II»||| i..—. —l. .III. m-i...

Confidential.) Sir, Bushire, July 23, 1911. I HAVE the honour to submit a copy of the report of my commercial adviser and vice-consul, Mr. II. G. Chick, on German trade and shipping for the fourth year of the Hamhurg-Amerika Company’s sailings, ending October 1910. His last report was forwarded with my covering despatch No. 4, Commercial, dated the 8th June, 1910. Two main facts, in a great measure dependent upon one another, stand out prominently in the report:— 1. The marked progress attending German efforts to capture and control the sugar trade to the Persian Gulf. 2. The important factor in their success represented by the use of Antwerp as an export base. f Presuming that when the Anglo-Persian Oil Company have their oil ready for shipment German steamers will no longer find it profitable to bring kerosene to the Gulf, the sugar trade will be their principal standby; it is consequently all-important to us to devise means of offering effective competition in respect of this commodity, and the figures and facts furnished by Mr. Chick clearly indicate that the use of Antwerp by the British, lines is greatly to be advocated, both in connection with the sugar trade and other items of continental export; but as to what the precise position is at present among the companies inter se, and how far it may now be feasible from their point of view to resume the call at the Belgian port, I have no information. In the above connections I venture, with the highest respect, to suggest that the Board of Trade be asked to convene a small conference of shippers and ship-owners to discuss both questions and advise as to the possibilities and most effective means of improving our position. As regards Bahrein and Lingah, it is still, in our local opinion, important that the Anglo-Algerian Company should arrange regular calls at each port. In spite of previous hints, they have so far taken no steps in this direction in regard to Bahrein, and I can well believe that they have been deterred partly by the absence of satisfactory mail or telegraphic communication with the islands. If, however, as there seems reason to hope, we shall before long see Bahrein connected with the other Gulf ports by wireless, this objection would disappear. Perhaps a knowledge of the intentions of Government in this direction would be encouraging to them. As regards Lingah, I was glad at a recent visit to that port to gather that Messrs. Gray, Paul, and Co., who, stimulated by the appointment of a British vice-consul, at length decided to locate one of their European staff at this port, find that the measure is having satisfactory results. The news of the probably early commencement of the Bagdad-Aleppo section of i the German railway from the Bagdad end indicates a development of far-reaching importance, which will clearly be of the greatest advantage to the Hamburg-Amerika line. As regards the point raised by Messrs. Lynch’s manager in respect to German rights of navigation on the Tigris, it would seem unlikely that the Germans would forgo the opportunity of placing their own vessels and employes on the Shatt-el-Arab and Tigris for the transport of material; but, if the statement that the Turkish River \ Company is to be transferred to German management is correct, a position is likely to ‘ be created which could hardly be regarded by Messrs. Lynch and British interests in general with equanimity. [2141 o—4j B‘vT\;.; -X li ■ / , TT / \ Whereas this report deals with a period ending October 1910, I venture to explain that the material on which the statistics are based takes a considerable time to collate, and necessitates correspondence with outside offices.

During the year October 1909-10 the 33,350 packages general cargo to Persian and Arab ports consisted principally of:— Coffee .. Matches Iron bars Candles Arms, ammunition Macaroni, &amp;c. 6,758 bags. 5,347 cases. 8,277 bundles. 1,544 cases. 3,131 „ 3,575 ,, r 28,632 packages. The 38,836 packages general cargo to Bussorah consisted largely of Coffee .. Matches Ironware, &amp;c. Candles Liquors 2,816 bags. 5,658 cases. 9,883 packages. 5,836 cases, Ac. 4,107 cases. 28,300 packages. Tonnage of Import Cargoes. Taking six cases of loaf sugar, twelve bags of sugar, and twenty-three cases kerosene as the approximate number per freight ton, the two-thirds of import cargo made up of sugar and kerosene would weigh perhaps 9,733 tons for Bussorah and GUO t 0I J s hu Persian and Arab ports. Assimilating these two sets of figures we mav assume that roughly two-thirds of the number of packages carried by each of the eleven steamers during the year filled a cargo space of 1,500 tons. Ihe principal items of the remaining one-third (general cargo) enumerated above would account for a further 850 tons per steamer. The total import cargo to the Gulf waters by eacn steamer may therefore, I think, be assumed to be approximately 2 500 shipping tons. * ’ mi addit T ‘ he ® uH a 5, d Shatt-el-Arab ports, the Hambm-g-Amerika steamers on this run call at Port Said, Port Soudan, and Jibuti.

The Bussorah figures for British vessels would probably be still more striking, but added to the fact that none of the three British companies sends vessels to Bahrein, that Lingah is seldom visited, the Bushire figures are sufficient to show that these two British lines are now quite out of the running for Belgian sugar, as compared with the GrPrniciii line. There remains the West Hartlepool Line, which loaded 21,657 packages sugar at Antwerp, but this line is managed by an Angb-German, and I gather that they are under some agreement with the Hamburg-Amenka Line m this respect, so if t ey ar only acting subsidiarily to the German company’s permission the position is lug y 'fstam'in the report on the third year of sailings it is a very great desideratum for the British “ shipping lines to resume their calls to Antwerp for Gulf cargo, would be important, as well as of great interest to learn from A ‘„.i 0 the exact position between the Hamburg-Amenka Line and Messrs. Stnck (the Ang Algerian Company, Ellermans, and Bucknalls) as regards Antwerp. . g Fkm information supplied to the Foreign Office by Messrs. Strick in Septembm 1910, it would appear that the German company suddenly terminated the = tten agreement under which they were working with him. If there is no agreement, what is to prevent the steamers of Messrs. Strick and associated companies resuming ^Seefng'S nearly all Manchester shippers are understood to be under contract to Messrs. Sttick and Co., and comparatively little besides sugar goes from London tec^ it is presumed that Messrs. Strick and Co would be m as idtie danger iroj y retaliation by the German company as the German company would be if Mess s. sent their vessel to Hamburg. ^ [2141 o—4]6 i li this is not the reason why Messrs. Stnck and Co. still abstain from sending- steamers to Antwerp, is it that the German line has a special agreement with the Raffinerie Tirlemontoise, or such brokers of its sugar as the Societe de 1’Exportation des Sucres, and that British vessels, even if they went there, would obtain vei little sugar ? ^ From questions put to Messrs. Czarnikow’s broker and others, I understand that they try if possible to arrange for shipments of Belgian sugar to the Persian Gulf to be sent to London for transhipment to the British lines; but in many cases, owing to date of shipment required and other reasons, there is no alternative but ’to let the sugar go out in the German line. On account of the dimensions that the sugar trade is likely to assume in the near future up the valley of the Tigris and, possibly, the Karun—in 1910 the quantitv to Buss°rah increased by 79,814 bags ]oaf=138,5731.—and owing to the fact that the Kamnerie lirlemontoise is one of the very few refineries which keep up the special machinery for moulding the sugar-cones preferred in this region, I would attach a great importance to the British lines calling regularly at Antwerp. Later C Qn ? Antwerp cargo may become of less comparative value to the German line, but it will never do m this early stage of competition in the Gulf trade for the British lines to he driven out of the Antwerp trade. le i; v ™g this subject I will briefly recapitulate the position of the sugar trade in the Gulf, and German connection with it. Loaf sugar is imported in very much larger quantities than crystal sugar. The principal refineries of loaf sugar dealing with this part of the world have been : Raffinerie Tirlemontoise, in Belgium • Hungary 68 d&lt;3 8 L0U1S ’ MarSeilles ; the refin ery of IJ.Z.J. sugar at Szerencs in sumPbut PTqOfiThl R 1 , t - h6 imP ° rt int0 Sophern Persia consisted of Marseilles su 0 ai, but in 1906 the Belgian sugar appeared on the market, and, owing to its the Gulf I',? 11 f 16 ® mpl ° yment of certaiu trade devices, began to make headwaf round the Gulf littoral For the past year or two the import of Marseilles sugar has dronued a great deal and is destined chiefly for Central Persia, while the Hungarian refinery has, it would appear, ceased working.

I doubt if the first named realise the increased activity of the Germans in this direction; and ^though perhaps a great deal ought to be done with British and colonial refined sugar, ▼ some sort of system will need to be adopted to popularise it, and it cannot be expected in any case entirely to answer the growing wants of these regions. Kerosene. The import of Galician kerosene is unlikely to grow, and is in fact considerably less than in former years. I am informed that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s oil | may be expected on the market about February next, and it is hoped that the oil will be sufficiently good to replace all foreign kerosene, at a much cheaper rate, and thus drive the Hungarian product out of the market, incidentally depriving the German line of 2,000-3,000 tons of import cargo per annum. Exports. Turning to exports from the Gulf during the period under review, the following are the results compared with those of previous years :— ■ 1906-7. Bunder Abbas .. ..

Reckoning by the tonnage scale, this makes a total for eleven vessels of 1,443 tons of exported packages from Persian and Arab ports, together with 9,241 tons of packages exported from Bussorah, to which has to be added 10,344 tons grain from the Shatt-el-Arab. The average weight of cargo borne on the homeward voyage was thus 1,912 tons. The net tonnage of eight of the eleven Hamburg-Amerika vessels ranged between 1,765 and 1,830 tons ; a steamer of 2,093 tons made the remaining three voyages. The dead-weight tonnage, or carrying capacity, for these eleven ships may be put down at an average 4,500 tons each. It is obvious, therefore, that the ships either went home more than half empty or had to pick up cargo in ports outside the Gulf. Besides the one vessel that proceeded with dates to New York and met with an accident in the Atlantic and an extra steamer of the Deutsche-Austral line which took dates from Bussorah to Australia, it is known that two of the vessels loaded on the Indian and Ceylon coast, and probably several others likewise, for it is reported that the Hamburg-Amerika Line, after loading as much as possible in each steamer, go away to the Malabar coast, where they are said to be under an agreement with the Hansa Line for alternate sailings. A high rate of freight is said to attract them, and by only partially filling their vessels they avoid the expense and delay of lighterage at the bar. Produce for export was scarce in the Gulf from the autumn of 1909 up to July 1910, owing to the failure of previous harvests, and when the poor results of the first three years’ sailings are borne in mind, it is evident that the German steam-ship company do not mind running at a loss over an extended period and are determined to maintain a regular connection in order to be able to claim a vested interest in the Gulfor Shatt-el-Arab trade, i.e., for political reasons, which presupposes that a subsidy exists ; otherwise, what business-like shipping company would maintain an expensive fleet—even to the extent of purchasing two larger vessels from Messrs. Strick and Cq. —for a part of the world where Germany has had no vested interests, where there i£ not even a moderate quantity of import or export trade with Germany, where there is but a single German firm—their own protege, and, to all intents, the sole shipper by the line—all for an average import cargo of 2,500 tons, and export cargo of 2,000 tons per voyage ? Messrs. B. Wonckhaus and Co.'s Business and Connection with the Line. Out of cargoes imported to Gulf ports (but not Bussorah), the own property of the German firm, or goods consigned to them for their clients, amounted to :— In 1907-8 .. „ 1908-9 .. „ 1909-10.. 68,396 packages out of a total 125,863 packages. 73,682 „ „ 104,410 71,446 „ „ 123,236 The latter figures, derived from manifests, are composed as follows, though they are probably incomplete :— To all Gulf ports— Kerosene To Bunder Abbas- Loaf sugar Crystal sugar Iron bars Candles Matches Beer Colours Spirits ..

Bushire. —Mention was made in the previous report that Messrs. Wonckhaus’s broker and the Persian mirza of the German consrdate had been large importers of arms at Muscat for subsequent smuggling to Tangistan, and that the former had suffered financially from the blockade, and had been called upon to meet bills from Germany. During his tenure as representative of the German firm at Bushire in September 1910 he sent 8,500 tomans (1,545L) of the firm’s money in coin in a native boat to buy grain a little distance along the coast. The boatmen afterwards stated that their craft had sunk and the coin been lost, but suspicions were aroused that the broker was implicated in the disappearance of the coin. Mr. Brown, managing partner of the firm at Bussorah, arrived to investigate the accounts and enquire into the affair, and the broker, finding himself discredited and pressed for money, absconded into the hinterland, saddling the German firm with a heavy loss. Lingah. —Messrs. Wonckhaus’s methods at Lingah, as agents for the shipping line, had been characterised for a long time by high-handedness towards the Persian Customs and British shippers, while reliable reports received left it hardly open to doubt that they took advantage of their private bonded warehouse to smuggle when opportunity offered. Financial Business of Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co. On the 1st October the commanditaire partnership between Herr Wonckhaus and Herrn Traun, Sturcken, and Co., in Hamburg, came to an end, and the business was then carried on by Herr Wonckhaus as sole partner with a capital of about 20,COOL Herr Wonckhaus was reported to be seeking English capital, and Mr. Otto Beit’s name j was very confidentially mentioned as willing to advance the firm 50,000L for ten or ; twelve vears. The director of the Commercial Intelligence Branch also stated in this j connection that “ Messrs. Wonckhaus’s Persian Gulf business is said to have been very prosperous, and with additional financial facilities the business is capable of greater development.” It is to be regretted if this firm, presumably merely a weapon of the Deutsche Bank, Hamburg-Amerika Linie, and German policy in connection with the Bagdad Railway terminus, is being financed from London. Though anticipating the report for October 1910-11, it is interesting to note, m connection with their financial arrangements, that the following credits were stated from Bussorah to have been granted to Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co. in January 1911:— From the— Deutsche Bank, Berlin Deutsche Orient Bank, Berlin .. Dresdner Bank, Berlin.. Ferdinand Jacobs, Hamburg Martin’s Bank, London in drafts of four months’ usance, payable in London. n . Also, in February 1911, 40,000L from German banks. Mohammerah and the Gull ports are apparently largely financed from Bussorah. . This money is now (1911) being utilised in the purchase ^of gram, ioi vhicii specially favourable conditions are prevailing up the Tigris and Ivarun and along the Persian littoral. The Germans are buying, at higher prices than British firms can afford, any and all grain, more particularly barley, put on the wharves, and then one preoccupation is to fill these German ships. The shipping line is believed to allow them a rate of freight considerably reduced below the 17s. 6d. now charged by the British lines on wheat. German Line and the Bagdad Hallway. £ 30.000 | 30,000 10.000 A report that the Hamburg-Amerika steamers would soon be bringing out railway material to Bagdad having emanated from the German office in Busline, enquiries were made from the resident at Bagdad and Messrs. Lynch as to how the transport o this material would be effected, and how British shipping on the -Tigris might e affected. Mr. Lorimer states that, from a conversation which he had with Meissner Pasha at Aleppo and subsequent information, it would appear that, after the survey is made and the alignment approved, construction of the Aleppo-Bagdad section wi begin from both ends simultaneously. According to Messrs. Lynch s own information, [2141 o—4] Dthe railway material will arrive at Bussorah as soon as the plans are finally decided upon, but it is not known yet whether negotiations have been opened with the Nahrieh as to its transport. _ Under the railway concession the German company seem to have the privilege of bringing up the material on their own river craft. Messrs. Lynch’s manager raises the question whether recent changes in the arrangements with the Turkish Government regarding the proposed Gulf section of the railway will have affected this privilege or not. It is obvious that the position of the Hamburg-Amerika Line will be strengthened by the acquisition of this heavy additional cargo ; on the other hand, the introduction of German craft on the Tigris, nominally for transport of railway material alone, may m the sequel, conceivably prejudice both Messrs. Lynch’s concessionary rights and also aid the Germans, with their system of rebates of railway and sea freights? to place German exported merchandise on the Bagdad and Western Persian markets’ cheanpr than goods travelling by English ships. According to a statement made by one of Wonckhaus’s agents to His Majesty’s consul at Mohammerah, the Germans are about to bring out six small tugs to the Gulf but whether as river-boats for the purpose indicated above or for lighterage nurnoseq is not yet known. &amp; Imposes A rather startling statement has, however, been made in the German office at Bushire, and m the presence of a British shipping agent, by the master of the Hamburg-Amerika steam-ship “ Hi comedia,” to the effect that the Germans would be shortly taking over the Turkish River Company’s boats, and then there would be good openings for German masters in these craft. Statistics. Details of imports and exports by the line to the various ports are attached. Nc new types of goods are to be noticed.

No. 6-Coml. (Confidential), dated Bushire, the nth September 1910. From— Lieutenant-Colonel P. Z. Cox, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Right Honourable Sir Edward Grey, Bart, M.P., Hi? Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Foreign Office, London. I have the honour to report further on the position of the lighterage question in the Persian Gulf. Firstly, as regards the situation in Bushire, my last report on the subject was forwarded to you by His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Tehran under cover of his despatch No. 15-Commercial of April 20th, 1908. There is very little of a general character to add to the information contained in that despatch, but the following is a brief resume of subsequent events which haVe brought the problem to an acute stage during the present year. Towards the close of the year 1908 both the British India Steam Naviga tion Company and the Anglo-Algerian Steamship Company took up the question and proposed to make arrangements for lightering their cargoes independently of the “ Hammal-Bashi ” or landing contractor. The scheme fell through owing to lack of concerted action, the Bushire Agent of the latter Company warning his principals that such a forward step would only lead to disturbances with the local community. In February 1909, without th6 shadow of support from its fellow shipping companies and without consulting this Consulate-General as to the suitability of the juncture or assuring themselves of the neutrality of the local authorities, the British India announced to the general public that after four days’ time all cargo arriving by^ their steamers would be landed by the Company, who would collect expenses incurred before the goods could be cleared from the Customs House. This sudden announcement caused the truculent Bushire boatmen to adopt a threatening attitude^ which might easily have led to serious breaches of the peace j while the Persian merchants forthwith proceeded to boycott the Company’s ships. At the same time, one Saiyid Murteza Ahremi, who had now temporarily usurped to himself the control of the Customs and local government, sided with the boatmen, and as the result the new venture terminated abortively two months after its inception. From this moment, April 1909, it must have been clear to the minds of the Persian merchants that they had the power to coerce any one shipping company into any given course of action by simply transferring their custom bodily to a rival line. No more was heard locally of the lighterage question until April in the present year when the SS. ‘ Broadgarth, ’ chartered by the Anglo-Algerian Line, arrived in Bushire drawing 21 feet of water. There are in this port two anchorages, the outer being some 8 miles and the inner some 3 miles from thelanding-stage. The latter provides excellent holding ground for ships of 18 to 20 feet draught only. The ‘ Broadgarth ’ therefore anchored in the outer roads, the principal consignees having been duly notified to that effect four days pre viously. The Hammal-Bashi was advised by certain of the principal Persian merchants not to land her cargo unless the shipping agents engaged to indemnify him for the extra journey involved. The shipping agents had, I think, two excellent reasons for refusing to do this (i) according to the terms of the B/Lading the Ship’s responsibility ceases as soon as the cargo leaves her tackles, that is to say the Company is not concerned with the landing of the cargo unless it is at the same time a landing company, and (2) in the agreement drawn up in 1905 between the principal Bushire merchants, both native and foreign, and the then landing contractor, their Agent, it was expressly stipulated that the latter should not be entitled to extra fees for lighter ing cargo from the outer anchorage. This agreement, which was registered in this Consulate-General, was unfortunately good only for one year and was never renewed : but in the absence of a fresh agreement the last one should be the basis of argument and serves to point to the moral inadmissibility of the Hammal-Bashi’s demands. When the latter refused to lighter the SS. ‘ BroadgarthI at once made representations to the local authorities and boats were sent oft after a delay of 28 hours, for which a claim of ^32-11-o for demurrage has been formally pre ferred by the Anglo-Algerian SS. Co. to this Consulate-General for favour of recovery. In June the SS. ‘ Trentham Hall’ (Messrs. Bucknall Bros.), consigned to Messrs. Gray Paul &amp; Co., arrived in port, and, as Hammal-Bashi refused at first to lighter her from the outer anchorage, she attempted to come in nearer and ran aground. Shortly after, the ‘ Luristan ’ (Anglo-Algerian Liner) anchored in the outer roads. Some days before her arrival earnest attempts had been made to arrange for matters to pass off smoothly ; but the local authorities were power less before the firm attitude taken up by the merchants and their landing con tractor. I was myself compelled in the interests of Messrs. Strick to interview four of the principal Persian merchants who happened to be agents for well- known British firms, and to appeal to their obligations as such to induce them to modify their attitude. One of their number guaranteed for this particular occasion to square the Hammal-Bashi, that is to say, he undertook to pay what the Hammal-Bashi demanded. At the same time it was arranged that the British Chamber of Commerce should at once meet half a dozen members of the Persian Chamber and discuss the general question. Nothing came of the meeting however, and immediately after it the Persian merchants began to discuss amongst themselves the advisability of boycotting the anglo-Algerian SS. Co. By the personal efforts of myself and my Consular Assistant expended in endeavouring to talk over the ringleaders, the fulfilment of this was stayed off for a time, but eventually on July 13th some forty merchants signed a solemn agreement to cease all dealings with the Agents of the Anglo-Algerian SS. Co. in any capacity whatsoever. A few days previously another Bucknall Bros, steamer, the SS. ‘Anatolia/ consigned to Messrs. Gray Paul &amp; Co., arrived early on a certain morning. As the Hammal-Bashi had previously called upon the agents and asked for money which had been refused him, the former declined to send out boats to the ‘ Anatolia ’ which was in the outer anchorage. After 24 hours delay, however, she took the risk of grounding and managed to come safely into the inner roads on the flood tide, and boats at once went out to her. As the Captain of the vessel complained to the agents of this delay, it is extremely probable that in due course another claim for demurrage will be received. \ The boycott of the Anglo-Algerian SS. Line is still in force at the time of writing and shows no sign of weakening in spite of the fact that warning tele grams have been sent to three at least of the ringleaders by their respective principals in London. The Residency and Consulate-General has exhausted its efforts to induce them to change their uncompromising attitude.3 The action of the agent of the Anglo-Algerian SS. Co. has been approved by the Bushire British Chamber of Commerce and appears to me to be strictly correct. It is probably however true that in former times certain shipping agents have privately given the Hammal-Bashi presents of money in order to avoid ^ costly and vaxatious delays and undesirable quarrels with native merchants ; who are thus emboldened to state that their antagonism is directed solely against the Agent of the Anglo-Algerian SS. Co. personally, and in no wise against the British shipping companies in general. The hollowness of this pretext is however shown (i) by the short-lived boycott of last year against the British India Steam Navigation Company already referred to and (2) by the fact that a few days before the incident of the ‘ Broadgarth’ occurred, the Persian Chamber of Commerce had decided amongst themselves that if the firm of Messrs. Gray Paul &amp; Co. (Agents for B.I.S.N. Co. &amp; Bucknall Bros.’ Line) did not cease their interference with the landing arrangements (meaning their present practice of partially unloading their own cargo and collecting their charges before releasing the goods) they should be boycotted. It may be mentioned here as throwing a side-light on the attitude of Messrs. Sassoon’s agent. Haji Rais-ut-Tujjar, that the present Hammal-Bashi is a relative of his by marriage, so that Haji Rais’ reasons for supporting him are partly personal. In my opinion the boycott of the Anglo-Algerian Line can only be termi nated either by compromise between the Agent and the merchants, which would involve the abandonment locally of shipping laws recognised in all ports of the civilized world or (2) by the ringleaders being made clearly to understand by their British principals that they will assuredly lose their agencies by persisting in their present line of action. The moral of these incidents is clear. In the interest of British commerce in this port, it is imperative that the despotism of the unruly boatmen and their hopelessly incapable leader the Hammal-Bashi should cease and that a competent Lighterage Company under the control of British Shipping Companies take its place. The necessity for this and the danger, almost the certainty, that in the opposite event other foreign enterprise will do the work instead, have already been dwelt upon in my previous report on the subject and need only be alluded to in this place. At the present moment the chief obstacle to advance in the direction of the formation of a lighterage company by the British shipping companies seems to lie in the existence of a certain amount of suspicion of one another in the minds of the agents of the several companies, or even the companies themselves ; and, more particularly in the difficulty experienced in getting the Bombay and Persia Steam Navigation Company, to join the syndicate. Recent news from London, however, warrants the hope that this difficulty is tending towards solution. With regard to the number of lighters available in Bushire, my information is to the effect that ordinarily these number some 14 to 16. Recently, when boats were out of harbour fetching in grain from the district ports, only nine were to be had. One heavily laden vessel (such as a ship carrying oil) anchored in the outer roads may need anything from 9 to 12 lighters for herself alone. Complaints of the paucity of lighters are only heard when two steamers happen to be in port together—a phenomenon which however is already not rare and might easily occur pretty frequently. On such occasions one of the shipping agents sometimes offers a present of money to the boatmen to induce them to unload his vessel first. As has been previously reported, however, a good steam tug with some 8 lighters in good repair would probably suffice at present; the difficulty is that lightering from a distance of 3 to 8 miles off with sailing craft only is a very tardy business in adverse weather, which sometimes even compels the men to row the wffiole way. Naturally the provision of boats which could in case of need make a double journey would make possible some economy in the number of the boats needed. With regard to the ports of the Persian Gulf other than Bushire itself, I have to report that with the exception of Maskat, where lighterage is the mono-4 poly of His Highness the Sultan, the agent for each company undertakes his own lightering, which occupation indeed often brings him in more profit than the agency itself. In Maskat there is no lack of lighters ; in the other ports they are somewhat scarce as regards the individual wants of the several companies, * but would be more than sufficient if all were under the control of one man or A one company, who received due warning of the approaching arrival of all ships ^ and was enabled to make his arrangements accordingly. It is generally con sidered amongst the shipping agents that it would be impracticable to attempt to form one general lighterage syndicate for the whole of the Persian Gulf, but they agree that such a scheme for Bushire is essential to the progress and well being of the port. While the foregoing paragraphs were being faired for despatch the Under Secretary’s telegram of September ist, 1910 was received giving me discretion to inform the Persian agents of British firms that the protection hitherto accorded them in business matters would be suspended until they ceased their attitude of obstruction. As I had just addressed one of them again at length,, a letter which will doubtless be passed on to the others, I propose to wait a few days to see whether it has any effect before making the further communication now authorised.

[35750] Consul-General Cox to Sir Edward Grey.—[Received October 3.) (No. 6. Commercial. Confidential.) Sir, Bushire, September 11, 1910. I HA\ E the honour to report further on the position of the lighterage question in the Persian Gulf. Firstly, as regards the situation in Bushire, my last report on the subject was forwarded to you by His Majesty’s charge d’affaires at Tehran under cover of his despatch No. 15, Commercial, of the 20th April, 1908. There is very little of a general character to add to the information contained in that despatch, but the following is a brief resume of subsequent events which have brought the problem to an acute stage during the present year. Towards the close of the ^ear 1908 both the British India Steam Navigation Company and the Anglo-Algerian Steam-ship Company took up the question and proposed to make arrangements for lightering their cargoes independently of the “ hammal-bashi,” or landing contractor. The scheme fell through owing to lack of concerted action, the Bushire agent of the latter company warning his principals chat such a forward step would only lead to disturbances with the local community. In February 1909, without the shadow of support from its fellow shipping companies and without, consulting this consulate-general as to the suitability of the juncture or assuring themselves of the neutrality of the local authorities, the British India announced to the general public that after four days’ time all cargo arriving by their steamers would be landed by the company, who would collect expenses incurred before the goods could be cleared from the custom-house. This sudden announcement caused the truculent Bushire boatmen to adopt a threatening attitude, which might easily have led to serious breaches of the peace ; while the Persian merchants forthwith proceeded to boycott the company’s ships. At the same time, one Seyyid Murteza Ahremi, who had now temporarily usurped to himself the control of the customs and local government, sided with the boatmen, and as the result the new venture terminated abortively two months after its inception. From this moment, April 1909, it must have been clear to the minds of the Persian merchants that they had the power to coerce any one shipping company into any given course of action by simply transferring their custom bodily to a rival line. No more was beard locally of the lighterage question until April in the present year, when the steam-ship “ Broadgarth,” chartered by the Anglo-Algerian line, arrived in Bushire, drawing 21 feet of water. There are in this port two anchorages, the outer being some 8 miles and the inner some 3 miles from the landing-stage. The latter provides excellent holding ground for ships of 18 to 20 feet draught only. The “ Broadgarth ” therefore anchored in the outer roads, the principal consignees having been duly notified to that effect four days previously. The hammal-bashi was advised by certain of the principal Persian merchants not to land her cargo unless the shipping agents engaged to indemnify him for the extra journey involved. The shipping agents had, I think, two excellent reasons for refusing to do this : (1) according to the terms of the bill of lading the ship’s responsibility ceases as soon as the cargo leaves her tackles— that is to say, the company is not concerned with the landing of the cargo unless it is at the same time a landing company, and (2) in the agreement drawn up in 1905 between the principal Bushire merchants, both native and foreign, and the then landing contractor, their agent, it was expressly stipulated that the latter should not be entitled to extra fees for lightering cargo from the outer anchorage. This agreement, which was registered in this consulate-general, was unfortunately good only for one year, and was never renewed ; but in the absence of a fresh agreement the last one should be the basis of argument, and serves to point to the moral inadmissibility of the hammal- bashi’s demands. When the latter refused to lighter the steam-ship f( Broadgarth,” I at once made [2931 c—4*] JV 19 OCT 1910 [October 3.] Section 4. No. 1.representations to the local authorities, and boats were sent off after a delay of twenty- eight hours, for which a claim of 3‘2L 11 5 . for demurrage has been formally preferred by the Anglo-Algerian Steam-ship Company to this consulate-general for favour of recovery. In June the steam-ship “ Trentham Hall ” (Messrs. Bucknall Brothers), consigned to Messrs. Gray, Paul, and Co., arrived in port, and as hammal-bashi refused at first tof lighter her from the outer anchorage, she attempted to come in nearer and ran aground. Shortly after, the “ Luristan ’ (A nglo-Algerian liner) anchored in the outer roads. Some days before her arrival earnest attempts had been made to arrange for matters to pass oh smoothly, but the local authorities were powerless before the firm attitude taken up by the merchants and their landing contractor.

It may be mentioned here as throwing side-light on the attitude of Messrs. Sassoon’s agent, Haji Reis-ut-Tujjar, that the present hammal-bashi is a relative of his by marriage, so that Haji Beis’ reasons for supporting him are partly personal.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 2, Commercial, dated the 12th May, 1909, I have the honour to submit a copy of the report drawn up by Mr. Vice-Consul Chick upon the operations of the Hamburg-Amerika Company during the third year of their service to the Persian Gulf. The statistics furnished indicate that the freights obtained by the company were about 30 per cent, less than those of the preceding year (1907—8) ; but this is not surprising, for, while the depression which prevailed in shipping circles generally during the previous year extended also into this, the continued and aggravated chaos which prevailed in Southern Persia both depressed import and reduced the export trade, always meagre at the best of times, to the most exiguous proportions. Kerosene and sugar were the two commodities in which the company operated most profitably. _ In regard to the former, we hope that it will not be long before the Anglo-Persian Oil Company are in a position to drive them out of competition. The sugar problem is the chief and most lively difficulty. It will be seen, however, from the details of Mr. Chick’s report that both in regard to this product and in seeking other openings for the introduction of British goods local endeavours have not been wanting or altogether unsuccessful. Messrs. Strick’s operations, in spite of the depressing conditions generally prevailing, seem to be progressing very satisfactorily at the present time, if one may judge by the number of sailings they have lately been able to arrange. No doubt the requirements of the oil company have thrown a good deal of business in their way, and will continue to do so. A regular service, however, with a regular call at Bahrein, especially on the homeward voyage, is still the chief desideratum—that is, if we except the resumption of their call at Antwerp—a course which, however desirable from our local point of view, is one they would presumably adopt of their own accord if they thought it to their own ultimate advantage to do so. On the whole, I think that the present report indicates that British efforts to meet the German competition are beginning to make some progress. As regards the present position of Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co., outwardly they do not seem to be relaxing their activity in any way, except temporarily at Bushire, where, owing to the insecurity of the routes to the interior, there is practically no business for them to do. For the time being they have transferred their European representative to Lingah, where they still have things their own way; now, however, that we have a vice-consul there, and that Messrs. Gray, Paul are at last sending a European to represent them, it is to be hoped that the position will improve. As to their actual financial position, it is difficult to conjecture confidently. The same damaging rumours are still heard, and the firm report that Messrs. Traun, Sturken do not propose to renew their deed of partnership lends some colour to them. It is interesting, too, to note that there is reason to believe that the personnel of the Belgian Customs Administration, who, owing to the very strenuous official support given to the firm by the German Consulate and Legation, have hitherto found them selves obliged to tolerate a great deal of irregularity from them, have at last seen their way to assert themselves in some measure, and no longer treat Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co. as a semi-official German institution whose absolute good faith and purity of method must always be taken for granted and considered proof against impeachment. Consequently, while it is hardly open to doubt that unscrupulous representatives of the firm and the Persian associates in collusion with them have not hesitated in the recent past to take advantage of the facilities which exist for enterprise in the direction of contraband trade both in arms and other highly-taxed articles, there is reason to think that, owing to the bolder attitude now assumed by the Customs Administration as the [2824 d—l] B n L/result of mature experience of tire firm, the latter is becoming more circumspect in its methods of business. I have, &amp;c. P. Z. COX, Lieutenant-Colonel, British Resident in the Persian Gulf, and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General for Fars, &amp;c. Of the in ewi but this wa! Report by Vice-Consul Chick on German Shipping and Trade in the Persian Gulf for the period October 1908 to September 1909. THE third year of steamer sailings of the Hamburg-Amerika line to the Persian Gulf covers the period October 1908 to September 1909, during which eight steamers of the company in question and one steamer (of Danish nationality) chartered by the company visited the Gulf ports. In the two previous years the number of sailings had been thirteen and twelve respectively, and thus there is no doubt that the German line has felt, similarly to the British conference lines, the effect of the unsatisfactory condition of trade in Turkish Arabia and Southern Persia. The absence of grain for export from the Tigris, the absolute failure of the crops in the Karum valley, and the disturbed state of the markets for imported goods in Southern Persia have affected all shipping, particularly steamer lines running between the Gulf and Europe, and the following comparative figures represent the corresponding decrease in British shipping for the years :— * September-October. 1906-7. 1907-8. 1908-9.

Tables are appended to show the details of the merchandise impoited by the German steamers at the several ports of the Persian Gulf; there is little to add to the report on German trade for 1907-08, for the classes, qualities, and biands of the various articles are essentially the same. The German shipping line continues to rely largely upon sugar and kerosene lor its outward cargoes, and in fact the remarkable manner in which its hold over the carrying trade of sugar consigned for Gulf ports has been increased affoids ground for fearing lest Germany should acquire a monopoly of the sugar trade heie.

The German firm, Wonckhaus and Co., agents of the Hamburg-Amerika line, are interesting themselves actively in the sugar trade in all Gulf ports, and, as the German vessels alone at present maintain a direct connection between Hamburg and Antwerp and Gulf ports, they are necessarily profiting by their advantageous situation as regards this trade. Kerosene. The imports of Hungarian kerosene from Eiume, first introduced by Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co. in 1907, totalled for the year under review :— Muscat..

Other principal Imports. Besides sugar and kerosene, which account for 82,078 packages, the other chief imports, that go to make up the total of 104,410 imported packages, are:— Coffee— Lingah, Bahrein, and Muscat Wood for date boxes— Muscat and Mohammerah Matches Arms and ammunition— Muscat Candles.. Packages. 5,813 3,649 3,380 2,043 1,700 Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co. and the Hamburg-Amerika Compang. —As regards the interdependence of the Hamburg-Amerika service to the Gulf and the business of Messrs. Wdnckhaus and Co., it was shown in the report of 1907-8, that 68,396 packages out of a total of 125,863 imported to various ports were either the own property of Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co. or consigned to them for their clients.[2824 d —1] For the year 1908-9, out of a total of 104,410 packages the following may he similarly ascribed to Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co.:— To all Gulf ports To Bushire To Bahrein .. To Lingah (at least) To Bunder Abbas To Moharamerah Total .. 51,700 cases kerosene (Fiume). .. 1,200 „ loaf sugar (Antwerp). 10 „ „ (Hamburg). 1.500 bags crystal sugar (Hamburg). 390 cases window glass (Antwerp). 1,200 „ candles (Antwerp). 98 „ beer (Hamburg). 30 ,, matches (Hamburg). 2 „ cottons (Hamburg). 27 ,, various (Hamburg). .. 5,359 bags coffee (Hamburg). 1,200 cases loaf sugar (Antwerp). 2.500 bags crystal sugar (Hamburg). 267 „ coffee (Hamburg). 500 cases macaroni. .. 3,324 „ sugar (per Lydia). 50 „ beer. 42 „ various. 2,550 bags sugar (Hamburg). 1,260 cases loaf sugar (Antwerp). 184 „ beer (Hamburg). 100 „ window glass (Antwerp). 80 „ matches (Hamburg). 109 packages miscellaneous (Ham- burg). .. 73,682 Thus Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co.’s share of the total cargo imported to Gulf ports was considerably higher than that of 1907-8. It is satisfactory to note that British firms have, on the whole, made less useol tne line in 1908-9 than in 1907-8, when it was demonstrated that they had been responsible for giving 22,468 packages of freight to the German steamers. Messrs. Ziegler’s imports to Bushire were :— Bags of sugar .. Cases of sugar .. Cases matches .. Bales cottons ..

Ziegler's agent in May 1909 that he had written several times to Manchester most strongly on the subject of shipments by Hamburg Amerika steamers; further, that the Manchester firm had advised the Societe de 1 ’Exportation des Sucres that continued shipments by this line wou d prejudice their business with the societe. He assured me that the societe wouldhenceforth, no doubt, always try to ship sugar for Messrs. Ziegler and Co. by British steamers as far as contracts regarding time of shipment permitted, and no doubt the same position holds good regarding Messrs. Lynch Brothers. Provided therefore that the good-will of the societe and Messrs. Czarnikow are secured in this matter, and sailings by British steamers sufficiently frequent, the use of the German line by British firms^ should be still less in 1909-10 and subsequently. Further, as regards the imports by Messrs. Ziegler and Co. of Dutch cottons from Antwerp, only sixty bales were imported by German steamers in 1908-9, as against 323 bales in British steamers, wdiereas 283 bales were imported by German vessels in 1907-8. As far as the ports of the Persian Gulf (exclusive of Bussorah) are concerned, the principal patrons of the line were thus Wonckhaus and Co. and the above-mentioned British firms. The destination of the other 25,000 packages varies, and remains untraced. Assuming that the British firms will endeavour to restrict their use of the line to a minimum, there rests the question as to how far Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co.’s imports are so likely to be, or can be, curtailed as to starve the German line of a great deal of freight. Obviously the items in which competition is most needed as a method of attacking their position are kerosene and sugar. Regardmg Kerosene .—An enquiry was made of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s representatives at Mohammerah in the summer of 1909 whether, pending the opening of the Ahwaz oil to trade, the Burmah Oil Company would not put a British oil. on the Gulf market to compete with the Hungarian oil of Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co., and it appeared that the Burmah Oil Company were debarred by an agreement with the Asiatic Petroleum Company from selling oil in the Gulf sphere. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company were, however, good enough to stimulate the Asiatic Petroleum Company to send up one of their English staff in Bombay last autumn to spy out the land, and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company have arranged to try shipments with Asiatic oil in the Gulf ports till their own oil comes into use. The Asiatic Petroleum Company’s oil is not a British export, and the company probably will be unable or unwilling to compete in price ; but the managing agents of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company hope that “ it will not be long before Persian oil comes on the market, perhaps a year or so,” when no foreign brand should be able to find a place in the market of Southern Persia. In anticipation, the names of suitable agents have been given to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. It may therefore be reasonably expected that after another two years Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co. will be unable to do much business in kerosene, and the German shipping line will be the loser of so much outward freight. Sugar .—This is the product in which Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co. do the largest part of their business in the lower Gulf ports. The measures suggested in the report of 1907-8 for stimulating competition are still being followed up. The Board of Trade state that Messrs. Henry Tate and Co. have been induced to send a trial consignment of 40 tons of their English crystals for distribution in the Gulf ports ; the sale will be conducted by Messrs. Gray, Paul, and Co., and Messrs. F. C. Stride and Co. have granted a specially low rate of freight. His Majesty’s consuls and political agents all round the Gulf have been asked to encourage further purchases of these crystals amongst the native traders who come under their influence. The crystals sent in the trial shipment are likely to compete very favourably with the Austrian brands, E.A.R., Z.K.Z., and S.P., exported from Hamburg, which now hold the market. Transhipment charges in the Gulf militate at present against Bahrein and Koweit being able to make use of these British crystals, for the home lines by which the outward freight is conceded do not call at Bahrein and Koweit. Mauritius Crystal Sugar .—During the year under report only 250 bags had been consigned to lower Gulf ports by the Anglo-Ceylon and General Estates Company, who failed, however, to fill orders for a very much larger quantity offered to them by Messrs. Gray, Paul, and Co. It appears that the slowness of communication with Mauritius—nearly three months by letter—is the chief obstacle to trade with Mauritius sugar being pushed here, and telegraphic communication at 3 rs. 1 a. per word is prohibitive. Pending any steps which may be possible to obtain a reduction of this rate, this consulate-general has arranged with the sugar company in Mauritius for the latter to send telegraphic quotations to Bushire at stated intervals, to hold good for a stated period. These quotations will be immediately handed on to His Majesty’s consuls and political agents at the several ports, and by them communicated to Messrs. Gray, Paul, and Co.’s agencies.7 Loaf Sugar. No steps by Messrs. Tate and Sons or other firms in England seem to have as yet been taken to offer competition to the Belgian brands R.T. and U.T.O., which at present hold the public taste in Southern Persia, and are brought out direct from Antwerp in these German steamers calling at Bushire. 0 According to manifests of British steamers calling at Bushire in the period under review no operations direct with Antwerp are shown, but 650 cases of loaf sugar from Antwerp w T ere carried by vessels of the Anglo-Algerian Company on their London manifests, and must have been transhipped. Coffee. —The direct German service from Hamburg to Bahrein and Bussorah, which together import some 12,000 bags yearly by the Hamburg-Amerika steamers, undoubtedly puts Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co. in a stronger position as regards the price of freight than their English rivals. Figures showing the imports by Messrs. Gray, Paul, and Co. by British India Steam Navigation Company’s steamers for a corresponding period are not yet to hand. Periodical calls by steamers of the Anglo-Algerian and Bucknall lines at Bahrein with import cargo may also be expected to produce some substantial diminution in the number of bags carried by the Hamburg-Amerika steamers, and consigned to Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co. Wood for Date Boxes. —Correspondence between the agent to the Government of Mysore in the Forest Department and this consulate-general still continues on the subject of the practicability of utilising Mysore timber for the boxes, of which large quantities are brought every year from Sweden and Fiume to Bussorah, Mohammerah, and Muscat for packing dates. The principal reason likely to frustrate this project appears to be the lack of skilled labour in Mysore necessary to turn out the boxes in a finished state. Arms and Ammunition. —It is satisfactory to find the import by the Hamburg- Amerika line to Muscat reduced from 5,241 cases in 1907-8 to 2,043 cases in 1908-9. This must have reduced their takings in freight by nearly 19,000L, and as the arms trade in Muscat has suffered a serious setback this season through the close blockade by the East Indies squadron, arms imports by this line are likely to be still further reduced. Freight to this port has undoubtedly been a great standby for the German shipping line in its forced entrance to the Persian Gulf trade, fuither loss in freight on arms would no doubt not be without effect m making the line reconsider its P ° ' The Persian Mirza and Persian broker of Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co.’s Bushire office have been large importers of arms to Muscat for subsequent smuggling to Tangistan. The prolonged blockade has now put the broker in a serious plight, as he is called upon to meet bills drawn on him by arms exporters in Germany to the amount of several thousand pounds ; and as on the one hand the arms are delayed m Muscat for fear of capture, and on the other his Bushire clients are demanding the return of their deposits, his difficulties should teach German arms exporters a sharp ^'svnthstie Indigo.—The sale has prospered in the interior of Persia the total number of cases imported to Bushire, Bunder Abbas, Mohammerah, and Bahrein being 345. Messrs. Lynch Brothers have taken up the agency at Ispahan lor tne manufacturers—Muster, Lucius, and Browning. # ^ x • j Velvets and Plushes.—A British merchant m Ispahan has offered to provide me with a full range of patterns of the types of German and French velvets, and to give information as to the widths, qualities, selvedge, and shades required m the Ispa an market, in order that these points may be brought to the notice of English manufacturers ^ G , erman pii sener beer were landed in the year under review As a result of suggestions from the Board of Trade to Messrs. Allsopp and Sons and other English brewers, orders have lately been obtained for trial consignments of the former’s English lager beer to several Gulf ports amounting to some 1-0 cases. Competition of the British Shipping Lines. Rates of freight outward and homeward have remained steady throughout the Wind under report by both the German and British lines. General cargo to London y British steamers plid 20a. per schedule ton from March 1909 onwards, having been \ ^ in Tamiarv 1909 and 17s. 6 d. from October to December 1908. Freight by German steamers to Hamburg was about 256^, but on a different tonnage scale, and probably were adjusted to the fluctuations of the British lines.The position of trade between the United Kingdom and Lingah has undoubtedly been improved in 1909, as steamers of the Anglo-Algerian and Bucknall lines have paid several calls with import cargo, whereas in 1908 the German line alone maintained direct communication between Europe and Lingah. If Lingah continues to be made a regular port of all the British lines, imports by the German line should be reduced#' Messrs. Gray, Paul, and Co. also write that they have practically decided to post a European agent at Lingah ; these steps, coupled with Mr. New’s appointment as vice- consul, should strengthen the British trade position as against the German. The Anglo-Algerian Steam-ship Company having requested the recommendation of a native agent to represent them in Bahrein, the political agent there urged strongly that Messrs. Strick and Co.’s vessels should call direct at Bahrein, and stated that about 1,200 tons of export cargo could certainly be obtained for them each year. Up till this year the Anglo-Algerian and other British lines running from London have declared that it does not pay their vessels to make the detour and call at Bahrein; and the fact that the Hamburg-Amerika line has made regular monthly calls since the Gulf service was initiated, seems to prove either that the British lines are too exacting, or that the German line is especially subsidised to go to Bahrein. In any case some exports from London and Manchester are penalised in Bahrein in comparison with direct exports from Hamburg and Antwerp, and this would be adjusted by several vessels of the Anglo-Algerian and Bucknall lines calling at the island. The English crystal sugar, which has been introduced to compete with foreign sugar in the Gulf, has been landed at Lingah, Bushire, and the Shat-el-Arab ports ; it cannot be tried in Bahrein, as transhipment from one of the above ports to Bahrein adds at least Hd. per cwt. to the price of the sugar. This is one result of the direct British lines not calling at Bahrein, where English sugar could be well pushed. Messrs. Strick’s agent leads me to understand that they are favourably disposed towards the idea of some of their vessels going direct to Bahrein each year, when sufficient export cargo also offers, and perhaps this step will be taken during 1910. Messrs. Strick and Co.’s agents at Bushire have tendered for the local agency of the Societe de Tombac, which exports annually nearly 1,000 tons of Persian tobacco to Turkish, Red Sea, and Mediterranean ports, and 200 cwt. to Egypt; this contract expires in April 1910, and has been held hitherto by the Russian Steam-ship Agency. The Russian subsidised steam-ship line to the Gulf hold the contract for the shipping of the tobacco, and this expires in October 1910. Messrs. F. C. Strick and Co. have been put in possession of all the necessary details, but apparently find the present rates of the Russian company too low for competition, though the position of the Anglo-Algerian line would be strengthened, as regards exports from the Gulf, by obtaining the contract. The greatest desideratum, however, for the British shipping lines is the resumption of their calls to Antwerp for Gulf cargo. The British lines have suffered considerably in loss of freight from their agreement with the Hamburg-Amerika line not to call at Antwerp, on which port the German line relies for almost one-third of the cargo brought by them to the Gulf. The Anglo-Algerian and Bucknall lines will not apparently risk reprisals on the part of the Hamburg-Amerika Company. [Messrs. Wonckhaus and Cods Business. Reports as to the instability of the German firm continue to circulate, though perhaps biassed and exaggerated. Mr. Robert Wonckhaus is said to have dissolved partnership with Herr Traun and Sturcken, who have financed the business from Hamburg. Mr. Thomas Brown, the stormy petrel of German commercial activity, has been absent on leave during the year under review, and the Lingah branch of the firm has been hardly as successful as formerly, having made serious losses in trading with Lar and Bastak, where political disturbances spoilt business. Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co. have been represented by a German at Bushire since 1906, and it therefore gave rise to speculation when they withdrew their German agent without warning in February 1910, and closed their office, leaving a Persian broker to look after the shipping work. The broker in question is stated by a Persian in the German service to be indebted to the company for 27,000 rupees on account of sugar advanced on credit terms, and probably also on account of arms. From Mohammerah it is reported that they are losing too much money to remain sound for much longer, unless they are prepared to put their opeiations on a more businesslike basis.On the other hand, Mr. Brown, the present manager of the firm in the Gulf, when in Bunder Abbas, announced his intention of stationing a German agent there to promote their own interests, and take over the shipping agency. Reports also mention that the German agent will probably spend the summer in Kerman and do business q there. Hitherto there has been no European agent of any British firm iu Bunder Abbas, and it would be most unfortunate if the first step in this laudable direction were to come from a German firm, especially as both Bunder Abbas and Kerman fall within the British sphere of influence. Messrs. Gray, Paul, and Co. have been pressed locally to post a European agent at Bunder Abbas but seem most unwilling. The Government of India and Board of Trade have been advised of this probable development on the part of the German firm, and will doubtless judge of the advisability of pressing the point on Messrs. Gray, Dawes, and Co. in London. Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co. have at present ten Germans on their staff at the several Gulf ports, as against nine Englishmen representing Messrs. Gray, Paul, and Co., the premier British firm in the Gvdf. German Activity in the Gulf. On the 31st October, Herr Wassmuss, the acting German vice-consul at Bushire, was ordered by his Government to proceed to the Anglo-Persian oilfields at Ahwaz and report. He concealed his intentions from the oil company’s managing agents in Mohammerah, and, in consequence, was allowed to see very little on arrival at the oil fields. No red oxide of iron has been exported from Abu Musa to Hamburg during the year under review. It has been found impossible to procure a copy of the recommendations of Herr Kurt Zung, the commercial delegate from Constantinople, who travelled through Persia in 1908 for the improvement of German trade in Persia. From a note in the “ Indian Trade Journal ” of the 15th July, 1909, among the “means advocated for adoption by German traders appear to be the establishment of more mercantile houses in Persia ; the sending out of commercial travellers to study markets ; the establishment of banks and sample rooms in the principal commercial centres, and an increase in the number of consular representatives.” i Imports into Bushire.

My Lord, We have the honour to forward the accompanying copy of a letter from our Political Resident in the Persian No. 1230 , dated the 23 rd May 1909 , and enclosures. giving COVer to a report Compiled by Mr Vice-Consul Chick on German shipping and trade in the Persian Gulf region for the period September 1907 to October 1908. Major Cox comments on the progress made by the Hamburg-American Line and the menace to British interests which German competition, commercial and political, con stitutes in the Persian Gulf, and concludes that some form of State aid to British trade is imperative. 2. We are well aware of the grave difficulties which surround the question of the grant of State subsidies to British Shipping Companies, but, in view of the political issues involved in the maintenance of British trade in the Persian Gulf, we venture to support Major Cox in his advocacy of t e grant of some form of State assistance to British and Indian firms trading in this region. 3. In view of the fact that other than Indian interests are involved, we feel that we cannot usefully offer any advice as to the particular form which such assistance should take, but we venture to refer, for the consideration of His Majesty’s Government, a proposal which has been brought to our notice that subsidies should be paid to British shippers in the form of deferredV.-V:; -.V ' l ^ • i rebates, under some such system of supervision as that outlined in Volume I of the Report of the Royal Commission on Shipping Rings, dated the 18tb May 1909.

Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—S. H. Butler, Esq., C.S.I., C.I.E., Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. With reference to my letter No. 2473 of 27th November 1907, I have the honour to enclose copy of a further report prepared by Mr. Vice-Consul H. G. Chick on the subject of German trade and the Hamburg-American Company’s second year of sailings in the Persian Gulf, which I have despatched to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. A copy of my covering despatch to Sir Edward Grey is also appended. Confidential. His Britannic Majesty’s Consulate-General, Bushtre, May i2th ) igog. No. 2. Commercial. Sir, I have the honour to lay before you a report prepared by Mr. Vice-Consul Chick in touch with me, on the progress of German Shipping and Trade in the Persian Gulf for the second year of the Hamburg-Americaa Line’s operations, namely, the period September 1907 to October 1908. The first year was dealt with in the previous Report forwarded with my despatch No. 7-Commercial, dated 27th November 1907. The material collected for examination has been on the stocks since Feb ruary last and I regret that we have not been able to submit the complete report before; but it will be realized that the compilation has involved an immense deal of labour and application the leisure for which Mr. Chick has only been able to snatch at odd periods of respite from the constant interruptions of local routine cases, which ordinarily fill up his working day. For the last six weeks, moreover, the petty urgencies of the political situation here have absorbed the time of my self and staff almost entirely. Although the Hamburg-American Line have paid no dividends for the past year; although it may be the case that their position is still weak and those con cerned in the enterprise undecided as to whether the game is worth the candle ; although, too, the commercial credit of Messrs. Wonckhaus seems to be depre ciated in the view of our own merchants, and they are carrying on business on lines which our nationals cannot imitate. In spite of all these considerations, the statistics of this second year of the German campaign seem to me to indicate that they have no cause to be disappointed with their progress, rather that we are afforded material for urgent reflection and action. Thus it will be seen from the information now furnished that, notwithstand^ ing the fact that the period under report has been one of universal depression in shipping circles, the amount of outward cargo carried by the Hamburg-American vessels has been very nearly double what it was for the first twelve months, while their homeward freights remain almost at the same figure. Our own Companies, meanwhile, have had a very bad year. Messrs. Strick, I believe, complain that 6n their Gulf service they can only just make ends meet, and Messrs. Bucknall have been in difficulties and in any case wall be running on very modest lines. Our merchants on shore, while disinclined to admit on principle that they are not holding their own, complain as above stated that the German firm is working on lines on which they cannot compete unassisted.I can well understand the hesitation of His Majesty’s Government to embark on a system of subsidies properly so-called, the application of which, among other urgencies of imperial commercial policy, it may be difficult to limit to the Persian Gulf. But I must admit that if we intend to maintain our predominant interests and position in this region the adoption of a definitely constructive policy both in commerce and politics seems forced upon us, and how any policy is to be fully effective at present, which does not include some form of State aid to our trade I find it difficult to conceive. I think it will be conceded that our nationals have so far been most patient and most persevering under great*stress: indeed we know that more than one of the chief Manchester firms interested have of late been placed in great practical difficulties owing to the large amount of capital represented by goods and out standings absolutely tied up in Persia owing to the continuance of the chaotic order of things which has now endured for three years. Unless we come to their aid; enable them to cope on more equal terms with German enterprise, and take steps to provide security for their goods on the main trade routes, we surely cannot expect them to persevere much longer in the unequal and unprofitable struggle in which they have for so long been involved. As Mr. George Lloyd has represented, it need not be a question of providing State subsidies for long or indefinite periods, but rather for limited periods, on specific conditions, for the accomplishment of a specific purpose. I venture to urge that the reality of the menace, which the prospect of perma nent competition, commercial and political, by Germany in the Gulf signifies and the vital importance to us of killing it in its infancy if it be possible, cannot be gainsaid, and in forwarding the present Report 1 beg to express the earnest hope that the suggestions already made by Mr. Lloyd in the directions of State aid, now reiterated here, will be taken into lively consideration. I have the honour to be, with the highest respect, Sir, Your most obedient, humble servant, (Sd.) P. Z. COX, Major, British Resident m tJie Persian Gulf, and His Majesty’s Consul-General for Fars, etc., etc. The Right Honourable Sir Edward Grey, Bart, His Britannic Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, London. Report on German Shipping and Trade in the Persian Gulf Region for the period September igof to October 1908. all DoTt^ofllTp g r h the Carg ° es im P° r ‘ed to and exported from all ports of the Persian Gulf by the steamers of the Hamburg-American Line and durinrThe 5 ‘e ereb 7 PUt mt ? the hands ,. of Messrs - ''onckhaus and Company Sentem her BB f 1™ f wh ^h roughly embraces the period German 1 inp^ L° 6 60 ® ct0 ^ er 19 ° 8 - In this period 12 steamers of the German Line, and one steamer chartered by them, visited the Gulf ports. The report is for convenience divided into two parts, consisting of: Part /.—General observations applying to German operations as a whole. each^f nal&gt; r Sat: ° n 0 r and remarks HP° n German trade to and from samples of goods ionvlrded, 3 '' ^ t0Sether Wlth lnformat i°n regarding various r'I r ? 5 The monetary assistance, given to the Hamburg-American Line by the venture, whether by German capitalists or by the German Government directly, would seem to extend even to a subsidized interest in the firm of Wonckhaus and Company itself, though of this we have not yet been able to obtain a direct proof. A German member of the firm of Heinicke and Company of Shiraz stated only the other day in Bushire that Wonckhaus and Company were subsidized. The trade operations of the German firm at Lingah, Bahrein and Bushire Conduct of these businesses in 1907 - 08 . are reported, by those best aole to judge, to be of so reckless a nature that no British firm, relying on its own capital, could sustain the losses which Messrs. Wonckhaus and Company incur over the extravagaat commission offered on the purchase of shells, the credits given and the general nature of their terms at Lingah, and bad bargains made, e.g. t in their import of kerosene. t On the other hand, neither the efforts of the steamer line nor the trading Company seem to have met with the early success which was expected in Ger many. The last two years have been very lean for trade all over Persia—and, to some extent, Mesopotamia—and the year iqo 8 has seen great scarcity of money and such a poor harvest that the export of grain from Basrah practically ceased for several months, the German S S, Savoia having to go down in water- ballast to Bombay to find export cargo there. On the Arab coast also, the great slump in the price of pearls in the world’s market had a most deleterious effect on commerce. We learn moreover that Mr. Wonckhaus has quarrelled with his principal in Hamburg, Traun, Sturcken and Company, over the conduct of the business in the Persian Gulf, and he has for the last two years been absent in Germany, where he is reported to be engaged in enlisting further financial support. One cannot but conjecture that, at present, opinion in Germany is undecided Unprofitable results up till present. as whether the game is worth the candle, in view of the enormous expenses, which would devolve upon the Shipping Line before it would pay its way, and the need of a substantial subsidy from the German Government meanwhile. On the other hand, there is no doubt that the competition of the German Line But depressing influence on British Lines. 1,33 Considerably affected the British Ship- ping Companies. Rates have been cut to a fine margin. Cargo, e.g. t sugar, which was formerly carried in British, is now carried in German bottoms, and the subsidy granted to the German steamers is enabling them to monopolize direct 'trade from Europe to Bahrein and Lingah, which have been off the usual run of the British Lines on account of the heavy expenses involved by the deviation. The position in the Gulf has changed considerably for the worse since the A. illustrated by freights. report made in November 1907 for the intentions of German policy have become more apparent, and the benefit of lower rates of freight seems only temporary, i.tf., until the competition in rates between the British and German companies finishes.

Freights for Suez Canal and other ports remained open to a “ friendly competition.' This arrangement, however, has not been strictly adhered to by the German Line, who have frequently booked cargo from Bushire to London, nor as regards Canal ports. But it soon became clear that the agree ment concerned more especially outward freights from Hamburg and Antwerp to the Gulf ports, which were to be left to the German steamers. Since early in igoS, no British steamer appears to have brought cargo direct from Antwerp to Bushire. ^ The trial already given to the arrangement has, however, brought to light the Effect on British trac’e. damaging effect on British trade which its continuance would occasion. The import trade from Europe to the G^lf, cotton goods excepted, largely consists of articles which have a continental origin, or are re-exported from the United Kingdom, The important imports of Austrian crystal sugar to the Gulf, for instance,^have hitherto come chiefly from Hamburg, but, the trade being through British , firms established in Persia and there being no German line, it has all been shipped from English ports. Similarly with the still larger amounts of Belgian loaf su^ar t is had been previously to 1906 all brought from Antwerp in British bottoms Other secondary imports of this class are Belgian glassware, Swedish matches* and iron foreign earthenware, all of which have in the past been ordered from firms m England and brought out in British vessels. The result of the British Lines agreeing to leave Antwerp and Hamburg to be served by the German steamers alone, or their acquiescing in preferential rates being granted by the German line from these ports, has been to throw these classes of goods very largely into the hands of the German line and the German firm. ^ The last few German vessels in the period of this report, vts., after the agreement was signed brought to Bunder Abbas no less than 11,110 bundles of iron and steel bars and sheets: the trade in Swedish matches in Bushire is now confined to experts from Hamburg, and orders are mostly put through Wonck- aus and Company. As there will be no means of preventing preferential rates ^'if n 1Ve a r th i?

As far as we can judge here, this end might be assisted in three waysA.—By Subsidies. A financial incentive seems the only method of insuring that the Anglo- For all ports to be visited.

The second item, needing a financial stimulus, is the export of pearl and Export Of she:i9, oyster shells from Bahrein and Lingah in , , , •» T , T British ships. It was urged in Major Cox's despatch No. 205 ©. January 19th, 1908, that the British India Steam Navigation Company should be induced by the Government of India to grant a rate of freight [° U / h tra 1 n . shl P men t to London and Hamburg, which would enable the British firm shipping to take a larger share of the trade than the half, to which they are limited by th e 1&lt;?&lt; /reference rates accorded by the German line to their own agents, in addition to lower freight rates. The market for shells has only been transferred of recent years from London to Hamburg, and a preferential treatment accorded by a British Shipping Company, to shells shipped to Eng land might possibly conduce to th.ese being put on the foreign markets at cheaper rates than now. A third matter of great concern, in which purely commercial measures do import of sugar. not seem to altogether meet the situation A . , _ , . is the annually increasing import of Ger- man Austrian and Belgian sugars, as against the Mauritius and Marseilles sugar w ich until recently formed the bulk of the trade.

Out of the 98,033 cwts. oMoaf sugar imported to Bushire in 1907-08 only 35,038 cwts. were of French origin—a large fallmg off from the 41,097 and ,0 9&gt;753 cwts - Lorn France in 1905 and 1906-07—whilst 51,600 cwts. were reckon ed to be sugar exported from a Belgian refinery, and the balance was Hungarian sugar. The imports to Bunder Abbas, Bahrein and Lingah are altogether composed of Belgian and Hungarian sugars. Similarly, the import of crystal sugar to the Gulf is almost entirely confined to Austrian E. A. R. crys tals, which are exported from a depot in Hamburg, with the exception of a brand S. P.^ which has been introduced from Germany by Wonckhaus and Com pany. It will be remembered that the German Consul at Baghdad in his report for 1906 alluded to the tf brisk trade in Belgian sugar from Antwerp which had been opened with the Gulf perts.” There seem to be signs that the German steamer line is endeavouring to obtain the bulk of the carrying trade for continentalsugar (except French), and, should the rumour that the Austrian Lioyd intend to open up a connection with the Gulf prove true, the sugar business will be likely to slip still more from British hands. A report on the sugar trade in the Gulf was sent to the Foreign Office in April 190 , and it was hoped that with this information, Messrs. Tate and Son would see their way to send local shipments of their article to various Gulf ports. In May 1908, a European, named Guays, did present himself at Bushire on behalf of Messrs. Tate and enquired at the Consulate-General whether a mono poly could be granted for the import of their sugar to Koweit. This was hardlv a feasible project, and the Sheikh of Koweit refused to entertain it. Even if granted, it would not appear to be likely to assist the introduction of British sugar into the Persian ports where we want to see it. Messrs Tate’s representative strangely enough confined his enquiries to Bunder Abbas and Koweit, and we trust that his rather perfunctory visit will not be the sum total of their interest in this market. Under the circumstances, the Board of Trade might advisedly be asked to urge Messrs. Tate to do something in the matter : and, should the latter’s prices be too prohibitive to compete with continental sugar, as appears likely, further to consider whether some form of State interference would not be possible. Meantime, there is a large amount of continental sugar being brought out Failing into hands of German Line. t 0 the Gu'f in German steamers by British firms, which need not so be brought, if the British lines could be induced to call regularly both at Antwerp and Hamburg and also at the smaller Gulf ports. 5»°49 Mohammerah, 5.100 baps and 820 cases at Bushire, 6,655 ba g s soft and 1,307 bags of loaf sugar at Lingah, 1,497 ba gs and 500 cases at Bunder Abbas, 3,797 bags and ',460 cases at Bahrein, 1 S * 1 54 ba gs of crystal sugar and 27,841 cases and bags of loaf sugar at Basrah and Baghdad, representing a total of 69,200 packages, were brought by German steamers in the year under report, and of this the greater part are consignments brought out by the several British firms, which would have come in British bottoms, had there been British steamers to brinp them As regards crystal sugar, an article of larger consumption amongst the Arab Crystal 30 gar from Mauritius, than the Persian inhabitants of the Gulf, Government has already been informed of the attempt made from Bushire to assist the import of Mauritius sugar ail round the Gulf. The Mauritius Government has been approached twice, but so far only one firm in Mauritius has been moved to make a trial, the credit system of business in Persia being rather incomprehensible to Mauritius exporters. Altogether 150 bags have been consigned to Bushire, 100 to Dubai, 50 to Kow^eit, 50 to Lingah and 50 to Bahrein. I am informed that orders for 700 more have now been secured at Bahrein and 150 at Koweit. Mauritius sugar is handi capped in the Gulf market, even given its prices are no higher than those of continental production ; popular taste demands a w hiter, larger crystal like E. A. R. The only way of assisting it to recapture a fair share' of the trade seems to point to cheaper freights from Mauritius direct or rid Bombay. In March 1908) the freight by British India Steam Navigation Companv steamer direct was Rs. 1-4 =20 d. per 75 kilos—exorbitantly high. The desirability of encouraging the export of this sugar to the Gulf by tempting rates of freight is perhaps worthy of suggestion to the British India Steam Navigation Company: a rate of 8 or 10 annas per 75 kilos should be aimed at. Bombay is a central depot for the import of Mauritius sugar, and we have also tried to induce a British Indian firm in Bombay to try this sugar in Bushire, but without result as yet. A further measure likely to make it more convenient to merchants to import Mauritius sugar is a reduction of the telegraph rate to and from Mauritius to the Gulf, This at the present time is Rs. 3'i * o per w’ord, a prohibitive price for merchants telegraphing small orders. As there were no telegrams sent from Bushire to Mauritius in 1906 and 1907 and only 2 in 1908, a reouction should pot prove difficult or unreasonable.9 B.— By British firms not shipping in German Vessels. It has been shown that out of the total imports to all Gulf ports except Basrah, viz., 125,863 packages, some .67,570 were either the own property of Wonckhaus &amp; Co., or consigned to them for their clients. At Bushire the British firm, Ziegler &amp; Co., of Manchester, imported 4,70b bags of Russian crystal sugar by German Messrs. Zieglers’ shipments in German ships. ^ ^ ba | es of Dutch Cottons from Antwerp, and 24 bales from Marseilles, 28 cases Glassware from Antwerp, 16 from Hamburg, 55 cases Matches. Total 5,181 packages. Messrs. Gray Dawes &amp; Co. of London have purchased 36 crates and cases of Glassware in Germany for a client in And others. Bushire, and brought them out in German steamers, and they have imported to Bahrein by German steamers 2,196 bags crystal sugar (Hamburg). 250 cases Matches (Austria, Sweden). 125 „ Vermicelli (Marseilles). 21 „ Lampware (Hamburg). 2 35 » Sundries „ Total afiaj packages. ft I further observe 23 cases Cotton Silk Velvet, imported to Bushire by Haji Ali Akbar and Sons, Limited, of Manchester from Hamburg, and 11 cases Plush— Total 46 packages. At Bunder-Abbas, the consignees of the 14,368 bundles of iron and steel bars, etc., are, so His Majesty’s Consul states, exclusively Hindu firms from India, who imported them through firms in Karachi, e.g., Forbes, Forbes &amp; Co., and through Gray, Paul &amp; Co., at Bushire (Gray, Dawes &amp; Co., London). Thus a few British firms are responsible for giving 22,468 packages of freight to these German steamers, nearly all of foreign manufacture and origin. In the conviction that the presence of the German line and Company in the Gulf if continued, is likely to damage the trade hitherto done by British firms, might it not be advisable to approach privately the firms mentioned, and suggest their endeavouring to arrange their shipments by British vessels only, during a trial year or two ? Were the British cargo taken away next year and arrangements made for the calling of British ships at the smaller ports, the Hamburg-American line would find their import cargoes heavily reduced. C. By encouraging British goods to compete mth German goods of the same class on the market. The thi.d means of discouragement of the joint German enterprise is to try to obtain through the Board of Trade British articles of manufacture to oust Continental goods now in demand .in Persia, which afford cargo to the German vessels. To enable the Board of Trade to get the best possible idea of these, samples are being forwarded ; but these are several lines calling for special attention. Sugar has been mentioned. As will be seen from the statistics, Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. have imported from Fiume 35,550 cases to the As illustrated by Kerosene. G u lf ports last year, and 61,579 to Basrah. The trade-mark of this Hungarian oil is 3 stars. Each case contains 2 tins of about 65 lbs. weight each. The oil is believed to have been imported on a con tract price for one year. His Majesty’s Consul at Fiume writes that the rate of freight to the Gulf is is. to is. ad. per case, subject to special rebates, and the approximate price per case is 35. 6^. to 3s. 9^. At present, local prices in the Gulf are about 14 krans=at present rate of exchange, about 5s. This would not leave much profit to the importers, so that it is most probable that they have a sub stantial rebate.10 The only ^cthcr sources of importation of kerosene are the United States and {via, Odessa and Suez). The import of Russian oil has fallen off considerably of late years.

The agents of the American brand are Gray Paul &amp; Co and Stri h ^ pe n-i th m they W T' d have made better use of thei ^ agency for the S andard Oil Trust to drive the Hungarian oil out of the market.

But the German Agent at Bushire has already attempted in 1908 to obtain the tobacco for his ships. Herr Heinicke has this year been named Agent at Shiraz for the Societe flic# a British subject, and similarly at Mohammerah the agency has been lately transferred from Lynch Bros, to Ter Meulen, Gratama &amp; Co., a Dutch firm, who are shippers in German boats. In June last, the Bushire Agents of the Anglo-Algerian Line wrote to the Director of the Societe de Tombac at Constantinople asking for preference shipment by his steamers. The reply was a non-committal one. Of the various points brought forward and recommendations made in 1907 Desiderata put forward in .906-07 report. 0nl y N °-.

Some progress has been made at Bushire towards the establishment of a Lighterage Company at Bushire. Lighterage Company. _ The British India Company s agents received instructions at the end of 1908 to have 6 sailing lighters built, and, in February 1909, orders to undertake the lighterage of their own steamers at a rate of Rs. 2*8=3#. 4 ^- per ton, the other British Shipping Companies having apparently not yet joined them in the venture. The measure has created a little resentment amongst lightermen and merchants owing to the high rate charged and suddenness of the step, but this will die down. The sooner the Anglo’Algerian and Bombay— Persian Companies decide to join the movement, the easier will the position become, and it is again urged that a small steam tug-lighter will make all the difference, both for speed on the many windless days of the year, and for proving to the natives the superiority of the new scheme. Apart from the subjects discussed above, there were several other features other branches oi German actmty. ^ German interest in these regions during the year under review. This official was despatched in the capacity of Commercial delegate of the n £ „ ,~ , German Empire to make an exhaustive study of trade conditions in bouthern and Eastern Persia with the object of putting German commerce in direct relations with various Persian centres. He visited Yezd, Kerman, Bunder Abbas, Bahrein, Bushire and Shiraz in succession. At Bushire he inspected the bazaars, obtained statistics from the Customs, and interviewed the principal merchants; to one of them he announced his inten tion of seeing that on his return to Germany more inducement was offered to direct trade between Persian and German merchants by better credits being offered in Germany. While in Shiraz he manifested to Mr. Grahame particular interest in the con sumption oi sugar in the Shiraz district. In expressing his concurrence with the pessimistic views of the commercial outlook held by the German merchant in Shiraz, he regretted “ that he should yet be called upon to write in an optimistic vein.” The German Government were successful in obtaining for Messrs. Wonck- The export of red oxide from island of Abu haus and Company the accjuiescence of His Musa - Majesty’s Government on behalf of the Sheikh of Shargah to their removing the oxide accumulated previous to suspen sion of the disputed lease by the Sheikh of Shargah, and the S. S. Louise took away some 1,800 tons in 1908. The knowledge that German influence was also at work at Tehran with a view to securing rights in connection with the more valuable deposits on the island of Hormuz goes to prove that, apart from any political and strategic designs, the German element is bent on securing a portion, or the whole, of the red-oxide trade in order to provide a further stand-by for the business of both Wonckhaus and the Hamburg-American Line.The question of the supply of the demand for red-oxide seems likely to be complicated by the fact that many islands in the Gulf besides the two above mentioned contain deposits of the mineral, though of varying quality. The appointment of the German Agent of Wonckhaus &amp; Co. at Bushire as Norwegian Vice-Consul has no bona ^German Agent at Bushire, Norwegian Vice-Con- fife justification, for Norway has no imports or exports to and from Southern Persia.

Drugs and Chemicals.—\7\ cases of drugs, etc., were imported in German steamers in 1907-08 as against 120 cases in 1906-07. 37 cases, with a total value of 22,400 Krans, were exported from Hamburg by Koch and Reimers and forwarded to the Pharmacie Militaire in Tehran, His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Tehran has been asked whether this Military Pharmacy is under German management, and if not, it might be possible to introduce a British firm exporting chemist’s goods to the management of the •See Addenda. Pharmacie,* The other 140 cases were almost all consigned to chemists in Tehran, e.g. the German chemist, Schwerin, the French Maulion and the Armenian Carnick Dalguidjian. Firms exporting from Hamburg were Koch and Reimers and Blembel Gebruder, medicaments particularly mentioned being Chlorate of Potash and Vaseline (25 cases). An invoice of the Vaseline shipped by J. D. Riedel Aktiengesellschaft in Berlin for the German chemist in Tehran gives 3 cases 4 White ’ vaseline, 80 kilos weight, size centimetres 120 X 36 X 30. Each case holds 14 tins of 5 kilos each and costs with discount, Marks 60*20=^3-0-2. Another 3 cases contained each 130 tins of l kilo each, costing, with discount, Marks 66*95 = There is a flourishing trade for chemists in Tehran, and perhaps British exporters could be given good introductions there. Paper .—170 bales of paper were imported to Bushire from Germany in 1907-08 as against 186 bales in 1906-07, nearly all destined for Tehran, the market for papers in Persia. Of the former 29 cases printing paper were consign ed to the Imprimerio Pharos in Tehran by Fertsch and Lacisz of Hamburg, and 16 bales wrapping paper to the German chemist in Tehran by Koch and Reimers. An invoice for wrapping papers supplied by j. D. Riedel Aktiengesellschaft in Berlin to Tehran gives prices for 2 cases of 87 and 88 kilos each containing 730 sheets as Marks 70-10 = ^3-10-10 per 1460 sheets. Kahn and Kahn also exported 74 bales of paper, presumably for printing purposes, and we notice the name of James Spicer and Sons exporting 20 bales. There seems no reason why all the considerable amount of paper required annually in Tehran should not be English, instead of German. Perhaps British paper manufacturers and firms could be .put in direct touch with buyers in Tehran instead of applying to V19 Bushire where there is no market. * See addenda. 140 packages at least of the total went through without breaking bulk, so that samples are not available here.* Linseed and Turpentine .—Out of 97 drums Turpentine and Linseed import- ed, 53 were brought from Hamburg to the order of a British subject in Bushire. As regards Turpentine, the drums hold some 5 gallons, and some 10 gallons, and the value of the total 53 drums was ^‘41-17-0. They were for use on the Persian Customs launches. The present prices at which they were bought are 3s. 6^. per gallon, and the second quality 2s. 2d. per gallon c.i.f. Bushire. The British subject in question will probably require some 300 gallons during 1909 and would like to know English quotations. Glassware .—98 cases imported as against 28 in 1906*07. 16 cases of the former (with a total declared value of 6565 Krans) were procured by Messrs. Ziegler &amp; Co. to the order of the Ahdieh Company in Shiraz from Messrs. Vaircn &amp; Co. andTachakert &amp;Co. in Hamburg. Of these, His Majesty’s Consul at Shiraz informs us that 5 cases were tall glass candle-stands with elongated glass shades, each case containing 20 to 25 stands or shades : 3 cases contained coloured glass tumblers with saucers to match, for which there is some sale in Shiraz. Sample No. //.—‘Tumbler with saucer. Retail price 10 Krans. Two cases contained thick glass trays. Sample No. 12 .—Thick glass tray. Retail price in Shiraz 18 Krans each. (N. B —Both these samples bear the mark of the Compagnie des Cristalleries de Baccarat) 6 other cases contained large flower-holders, 2 feet and 1 foot high, sold in sets, but almost all still unsold. There is in ordinary years a certain sale for flower-stands and vases in Shiraz and Isfahan, and another British firm has been trying Bohemian-made glass this year in Shiraz. Some English glass making firms might be recommended to Messrs. Ziegler in this connection. 34 crates and cases of glassware, chiefly tumblers. Decanters (total value of ^100-9-3) were also brought by Messrs Gray Dawes &amp; Co. from Hamburg for a customer in Bushire. I much doubt if this order is likely to be repeated. Lampware .—9 cases went through to Tehran, bulk unbroken, value of the same being Krans 3,850. China and Earthenware .—Import of 75 cases. 39 of these were manifested as porcelain plates and 24 cases as crockery shipped by Alois Schweiger &amp; Co. of Hamburg, and Bills of Lading consigned to the Chartered Bank^ of India, Australia and China at Bombay, and forwarded to Shiraz. They were, it is under stood, a sort of desert or fruit plate with a portrait of the Shah in the centre. No samples available at Bushire. Antwerp Cargo. Cotton Goods .—368 bales imported in 1907-08 as against 171 bales in 1906-07. Of these, 323 bales were imports on consignment by Messrs. Ziegler &amp; Co. from G. J. van Heek &amp; Zonen of Enschede in Holland, with a total value of Krans 140,495 (^2,554), being drills and cambrics of Dutch manufacture, which have had a constant market in Isfahan for some years past. There is no sale for them in Bushire and Shiraz, and they do not break bulk. Sample No. /j.—Cambrics “Peacock” brand, 16 yards per piece, 44 inches wide, costing 45. \d. per piece ci.j. Sample No. 14 .—Cambrics ” Lion &amp; Sun” brand, 16 yards per piece, 44 inches wide, costing 45. \d. per piece c.i.f. Bushire.

Bushire.20 To the last prices has to be added 10^. per piece packing, for freight and insurance. Perhaps the Board of Trade would consider the possibility of either (i) putting some Manchester firm up to a trial of British drills and cambrics vying in quality and as cheap in price as these Dutch goods which ought not to have this constant market in Persia; or (ii) ascertaining whether Messrs. Ziegler would change their source of supply. (See also under Mohammerah). Of the remaining bales from Antwerp, 39 bales were shipped by the Holland Bombay Trading Company, Limited, to Shiraz, and have not yet been traced on the market. Candles .—Total imports to Gulf ports in 1906-07 was 1898 cases (Bushire 800 cases) and to Bushire in 1907-08, 1,100 cases. These are specially consigned by Traun Sturcken &amp; Co. of Hamburg, the principals of Waunckhaus &amp; Co. to the latter for sale. They are stearine candles from the Apollo manufactory at Schiedam in Holland, and are in 2 brands. Sample No. ij .—“ Paragon,” 30 packets of 6 candles per case. Wholesale price in Bushire, Krans 28. Sample No. 18. —“Excelsior,” 30 packets of 6 candles per case. Wholesale price, Bushire, Krans 26J. In January 1909, the retail price of the latter was Krans 25 per case, Customs duty lying with the local buyer (almost another 2 Krans). These Dutch stearine candles are more heavily priced than the Burma Oil Company’s wax candles to the extent of 3 or 4 Krans per case, but there is always a good sale for stearine candles for use in the Gulf in preference to wax candles on account of the susceptibility of the latter to the heat. Another point about this import of stearine candles is that they all seem to be made in Holland in Schiedam or Amsterdam, but bear the marks of different importing firms. Thus until lately Messrs. D. Sassoon &amp; Co. were large importers of a brand also made at the Apollo factory in Schiedam. The Customs statistics for the year March 1906-07 and March 1907-08 show cwts 1,221 and 1,473 respectively coming from Europe, valued at £2648 and ^3,488. If there are manufacturers of stearine candles in the United Kingdom, would the Board of Trade think it advisable to put them in communication with British firms trading in the Gulf, so as, if pos sible, to lessen the need of British firms going to Holland for the article ?

The 700 bags of raisins were exported by Herr Heinicke, the German trader in Shiraz, direct to New York, where he seems to have a small, but regular market. The rose-water and tobacco were for the Red Sea only. The opium and gum Tragacanth (largely) were exports for London, shipped by Persians, but it may be noted that Messrs. Ziegler exported some 130 chests of opium during 1907-08 from Isfahan to a German merchant in Darmstadt. Addenda. (Page 17) Vehets and Plushes. Sample No, 6-A.—Plush, 18 inches wide. Each 40 yards.

Taking the Hamburg American Co.’s freight for arms to be 120 Marks per case of arms and ammuni tion, this alone will have benefited them to the extent of some ^ 1,446. Any measures taken internationally as a result of the Arms Conference towards prohibiting the import into Maskat would therefore seriously damage any profits which the German Shipping Company make on their run up the Gulf, and materially aid us in the object in view, viz., the discouragement of that Company from competition with British Ships in the Persian Gulf. Cotton Goods .—551 bales of American sheeting were imported from Aden— where they had come from New York—as against 597 h a ^ es ' n I 9 0 ^' 0 7 * About 1,000—1,200 bales of this sheeting are said to be consigned annually from Aden to Maskat, almost always for sale on shippers’ account, the latter in 1907-08 being the Indian firm in Aden, Haji Alibhoy Jumma, Lalji and Co. 8 5 bales, and Monham Messa 436 bales. The freight per bale from Aden to Maskat is Rs. 1-8 to Rs. 3*8 by the British Lines and Rs. 1*8 to Rs. 3-8 by the German Lines, but weight depends onthe number shipped. Private arrangements are entered into with the Shipping Agents, and the British is generally higher than the German rate by 4 to 6 annas. The Political Resident at Aden has now been asked to use his good offices privately with the shippers in order to encourage them to give the British Lines calling at Aden the benefit of their shipments to Maskat. Apart from the question of discouraging shipments from Aden to Maskat by the German Line, there is the question of replacing these goods in Aden and Maskat by Manchester goods, which does not come into the scope of this report. For the information of the Board of Trade it is noted that these American Sheetings have been on the market in Maskat now for a number of years. There are about 10 to 15 different qualities imported, 25 pieces of 30 yards to to the bale.

Vermicelli. —There was an increase from 79 to 175 cases imported. The import from Marseilles to Rahrein and Maskat is quite considerable, and it would seem worth the while of the British Shipping Companies to induce the shippers to give up confining their consignments, or at any rate according a preference to the German Line. It was noted in last year’s report that according to rumour the Hamburg American Line had concluded a special arrangement with the exporters of Vermicelli from Marseilles. The Ochre ( u Wares”) brought to Maskat in these German ships is also transhipment from Aden to Maskat for sale on commission. In this case too if the consignment is made via Bombay or the Anglo Algerian Line, the freights are higher than the Germans’ by 8 or 4 annas per bag. Each bag contains about 225 lbs. to 350 lbs and prices ranges from is. od. to 2s. A,d. per lb. according as the stuff is mild or strong in colour. Included in the miscellaneous articles landed are 54 cases of presents to His Highness the Sultan of Maskat from East Africa valued at £2,000. 100 100 bags of crystalized sugar were imported by the French firm of Baijeot and Cie.J If ' 26 Bunder Abbas. Imports by the Hamburg-American Line rose from 5,247 to 17,685 pack ages. Of this no less than 14,368 were bundles of and 5/^/bars, and iron plates. I am informed that these were mostly shipped from Antwerp, and not Hamburg, to British Indian (Hindu) firms, who apparently obtained these goods by sending orders through British firms in Karachi, e. g., Forbes, Forbes &amp; Co., Macdonald &amp; Co., Volkart Bros, and E. D. Sassoon &amp; Co., and also Messrs. Gray Paul &amp; Co., Agency at Bushire. The names of the chief Hindu consignees in Bunder Abbas are :— Hukmatrai Mohandas. Hasanand Chetandas. Tharoomal Radha Kashin. Messrs. Gray Paul &amp; Co , at Bushire state that the stuff ordered through them by the first named Hindu was principally Swedish iron and Basic steel obtained from Messrs. R. W. Mc’Clellan &amp; Co., Limited, 108, Cannon Street, London. The invoiced prices of these (presumably f. o. b. Antwerp) are ;— £ i. d. Basic steel bars (flat) ... 526 pec ton. „ „ „ (square) ...

Local retail price, 2 Krans per man. These metals are used for building in Bunder Abbas, and the import is likely to be well maintained in succeeding years, the annual demand amounting to about 4,000 cwts. valued at nearly ^3,000. I was informed in January 1909 that other consignments, that had been ordered out, were coming by German steamers. The markets supplied are Yezd, Kerman, Sirjan, Lar, Darab and local. The Board of Trade will be able to judge of the possibility of putting English steel and iron on the market in Bunder Abbas, as cheap as the Belgian27 or Swedish article, in which case Messrs. Forbes Forbes, Macdonald &amp; Co., Messrs, Gray Dawes &amp; Co., the other firms and Hindu traders mentioned seem the best people to canvass* Almost all the 14 j 3^8 bundles mentioned were brought during the last &lt;-6 months of the period covered by this report, *.&lt;?., during the period the British Combine had made an agreement with the Hamburg-American Line to call at Antwerp and Hamburg. In the same space of time, no steamers of the British Combine landed any metals at Bunder Abbas, and only 143 bundles of iron were imported from British Steam India Navigation Company’s boats. This fact only serves to accentuate the undesirability, from the British point of view, of the English Lines concluding any rate or pool agreement with a foreign line by which the former are debarred from calling at such a port as Antwerp, for it gives foreign trade an opportunity for a foothold in Bunder Abbas. It has been observed that the tendency is for direct trade between the Gulf Ports and Europe to increase annually, and for trade with India to decrease or not advance. And so it is an anomaly to find Bunder Abbas, which is specially designated as being in the British sphere of influence, relying, for its direct trade with Europe in an article like iron, on ships of a foreign nation now carrying on an active competition against British trade. So far Messrs. Waunckhaus &amp; Co. have not established a regular Agency in Bunder Abbas, but there have been reports of their intention to send one of their assistants there, and it is expected that they will do so as soon as telegraphic communication is started with other ports. Messrs. Gray Paul &amp; Co. have been often urged to post one of their European staff in Bunder Abbas for some month each year, and, should Messrs. Waunckhaus &amp; Co. open business, this would become a matter of neces sity as far as our commercial interests in that port are concerned. In Lingah we are now experiencing much inconvenience from the German firm having had its position unchallenged and rather all its own way for the last six years. Enamel Ware .—No samples are available, all having gone forward to Yezd without breaking bulk. The importers in this latter place are the respectable Parsee firm of Jamshidian, whose name might be noted by British exporters of this ware. Sugar and Kerosene. —The import to Bunder Abbas is alluded to under the comments in Part 1 of this report. Exports .—Only 1 steamer of the British Combine called at this port for direct shipment to the United Kingdom during the 13 months September 1907— October 1908. This accounts for shipments to London of Gum Tragacanth, etc,, taking place in German steamers. At the samo time, it is a pity that British steamers cannot call more regularly.Bahrein. British trade is seriously handicapped in these islands by the fact that no steamers of the British lines importing goods direct from Europe call there, the reason given being that the deviation from the direct course from Maskat to Bushire, and the time spent in the anchorage at Bahrein, is too expensive in proportion to the freight obtained to make it worth their while under actual conditions. Before the advent of the German Company, this attitude did not inflict any special damage on British imports to the islands, for the British India Steam Navigation Company had practically the whole of the carrying trade, but now the very considerable amount of cargo brought direct from Europe each year is borne by German ships only. It is superfluous to dilate on the evil influence this has on the trade in goods of British origin, or on the undesirability of an Arab island under British protection having to rely for its intercourse with Great Britain on the regular monthly German steamers. If it cannot pay the English steamers to call, it presumably must be a dead loss for the Hamburg steamers to do so. The inference drawn is that the subsidy made to the German line alone permits it to undertake expenses attendant on calling regular ly at Bahrein, Bunder Abbas and Lingah. ^ It is hardly to be wondered at that the Agents of the German line lose no opportunity of hampering the operations of their rivals, when shipping or re- ceving consignments by the German steamers. According to a good source of information, the freight on shells exported by Waunckhaus and Company and their clients is allowed by the shipping line a rebate of is. per ton less than the freight accorded to the British firm, Gray Paul and Company and their clients. On one occasion in 1908 when the German steamer brought to Bahrein a large amount of sugar and other goods for both Gray Paul and Company and Waunckhaus and Company the latter’s cargo was landed and the British Company’s overcarried to Bushire under the pretext of stress of weather. This enabled the German firm to get their cargo on the market first, and involved the British Company in considerable loss. When the claim was made to the German steamer Agents in Bahrein, they declined to consider it, maintaining that under the Bill of Lading Messrs. Gray Paul and Company would have to fight their case in Hamburg. A second claim made by Gray Paul and Company with reference to bags of sugar certified to have been torn when taken from a German vessel was met by the German Agents with the same reply. Gray Paul and Company appear unable to compete in such an important line as piece-goods, although, according to the steamers’ manifests 94 bales of English cottons were imported direct by German steamers due to the large rebate of 55. per ton offered for English cotton goods sent to Hamburg for transhipment, only 2 bales of these were for Messrs. Gray Paul and Company. The upshot of the case in Bahrein is that the British firm find it irksome to have their import business from Europe direct in the hands of a German Ship ping Company whose Agents and proteges, Wauncknaus, are their own chief opponents. The writer recently saw a letter from Messrs. Gray Dawes and Company in reply to an enquiry by the Bahrein Agency whether they could arrange for shipments of sugar in other than German ships : they explained that they had no choice in the matter : the freight by British Steamer to India being 365'. per ton, by Austrian Lloyd transhipment in India and British India Steam Navigation Company 325. and by Hamburg American steamer only 26s. per ton. A regular call at Bahrein (Lingah and Bunder Abbas) by the Anglo Algerian and other companies directly serving the Gulf would solve most of these ques tions, and in connection with the recent endeavour of the Board of irade Commissioner to arrange for the establishment of sample rooms, at considerable cost to the Government, by which English goods would be pushed on the Gulf markets, it should be remembered that the scheme is likely to be nullified in Bahrein and Lingah, unless it can be arranged for such goods to come direct from Great Britain in British ships.ICM&amp;K'?** urn The following interesting table shows how German trade and Waunckhaus and Company benefit by their direct intercourse with Europe to the disadvantage of Gray Paul and Company Waunckhaus &amp; Co.

Crystal sugar.—As stated in the Bushire report on the import of sugar to the Gulf, the crystal par preference in this and other ports is E. A. R., an Austrian brand, shipped from a depot in Hamburg. Bahrein, like most Arab ports is more partial to Crystal than Loaf sugar, and more than anywhere else it offers the best prospects for reviving the import of British sugar from Mauritius. The Bahrein Agent of Messrs. Gray Paul and Company has been able to book orders for some 1,000 bags in the last few months, and writes that he hopes to be in a position to put through a fairly large business. But until they can turn out in Mauritius crystals of a larger size and whiter colour, more like the Austrian E. A. R., a large supply of this latter is certain to continue in demand in the various ports.

At Lingah the German position is stronger than in anv of the other ports and the situation of British trade there has become more serious during the last ) ear face of the continued predominant influence of Messrs. Waunckhaus &amp; Co. For this the British Combine is largely to blame, since, as in the case of Bahrein, their ships do not call at Lingah, and all direct intercourse with Europe is thus confined to the regular monthly arrivals of the Hamburo'-American steamers. It used to be thought that the needs of the smaller Gulf ports could best be supplied from India by the weekly steamers of the British India Steam Naviga tion Company and the Bombay-Persian line, and that it was unjustifiable expense for the Home-going English Lines to share in the carrying trade. This idea has been exploded by the operations of the German subsidized line, for it is plain that a great part of the trade has been deviated from India to Europe by the fact that many necessaries, sugar, etc., can be put on the market in Lingah as cheap ly as, sometimes _ cheaper than, goods imported India. The reason is not far to seek when it is considered how heavy the British India freight rates are from Bombay to Lingah. At Lingah, as at Bahrein, the German Agents of the Hamburg American Line have not been slow to use their monopoly of direct European trade to har- rass their English rivals, and it is at Lingah there appears to be a good oppor- tunity for the British firm to force Mauritius sugar, which is carried in English ships, on to the market, but unless some special arrangements for very low freight can be made with the British India Steam Navigation Company the difference in price C. 1 . F. between it and the Austrian E. A. R., which is the standard by reason of its white colour and the size of the crystals, is too small to enable it to capture more than a small portion of the trade. It is disquieting to hear such frequent reports both from natives and Euro peans of the manner in which the German firm now “ run ” Lingah, and the present situation may thus be summed up. Ltngah ceased to be an important port with the enforcement of the Persian Customs Tariff by the Belgian Administration, the trade having largely transfer red itself to Dubai on the Arab coast, but inasmuch as the insiitution of the German service has opened a direct trade between Europe and Lingah, (which Dubai has not got), business in Lingah has slightly recovered. There are how ever no native firms there with any reserve capital and up till lately only a native Agency of Gray Paul &amp; Co., Waunckhaus it Co., with a manager and two Ger man assistants, are thus left without any real competitors. It is interesting to note the remarks made on the latter’s methods of business by the Residency Agent (a very shrewd Arab and a trader himself):— (Translation) : “ Messrs. Waunckhaus &amp; Co., whenever they import any merchandize, and Lingah merchants have already got similar goods in stock, lower the price and sell it. No native merchant, who has thus imported goods will sell them at a loss as long as he is able to stand out; but, after having wait ed for some time he is obliged to, and sells at a loss, //e does not import thit merchandize a second time but buys those goods from Waunckhaus &amp; Co. But if a large firm were to take steps to import merchandize, Messrs. Waunckhaus &amp; Co. will be obliged to curtail their own business, since they know that such a large firm will not stop importing a particular line because it has once dropped money on a transaction.” He then gives an instance in point. In the first year of steamers’ sailings 5,772 cases arid bags of loaf sugar were imported, as will be seen in last year’s report. This year only 1,307. He induced David Sassoon &amp; Co., Limited to send a large consignment of sugar, the Germans lowered the prices, Messrs. Sassoon maintained theirs; the German sold at a loss, and finally closed their business in sugar for the time being. He concludes : — “ In my opinion, if a firm of good standing were to begin to bring merchan dize to Lingah, and shut their eyes to profits for one year, without doubt Waunckhaus &amp; Co. will have to close up their business altogether. Eventhough that firm were to suffer losses in the first year, yet in the second year they would make up for it.” These recommendations of his cannot be too strongly urged on the principals of such a firm as Gray Paul &amp; Co. (Gray Dawes &amp; Co.). After repeated representations from Major Cox during the last year they deputed to Lingah in the autumn a Eurasian from among the number of their subordinate staff, a man of mediocre capacity not equal to competition with the German representative. It is doubtful if there is sufficient trade in Lingah for two European firms, and the British firm might well consider the advisability of ousting the German firm out of the place by fighting the Germans on their own trade ground. At present this is hardly being attempted. When the Manchester partner of the firm of Haji Ali Akbar &amp; Sons Limited (of London &amp; Manchester) was making a tour early in 1908 in Southern Persia, in the course of which he had booked important orders during his journey from Bunder-Abbas via Lar to Lingah, he expressed, while in Bushire, a desire to open an Agency of his firm (which is a considerable exporter of Manchester cottons to Persia) in Lingah. At the spme time he urged the importance of expediting the appointment of a Consular Officer at Lingah, where he had gained the impression that British trade interests were at present inadequately represented. There in unfortunately a good deal of truth in this remark largely owing to the undesirable influence acquired in Lingah by Mr. Brown, the (Manager of Messrs. Waunckhaus &amp; Co.) and his anti-British tendencies. Mr. Brown, who is the son of Scotch parents born in Germany, will be remembered as taking a prominent part in the Abu Musa affair, in which his efforts have materially assisted the German case. During the existence of a local Majlis in Lingah Mr. Browm meddled openly in Persian politics and took part in the discussions with a view to displaying the German support of the constitutional movement. He has given credits of such liberality and in many cases so forgiven natives’ unpaid debts, that he has bound many Arab traders to support the German firm ex clusively, while at the same time these unbusinesslike transactions have streng thened the conviction of British firms in the Gulf, that Waunckhaus &amp; Co, must be covered by financial support in Germany in order to make these losses and yet contrive to do business on their present lines. While the writer was at Lingah in December 1908, Mr. Brown and his assistants had started on a short tour in the interior which, they gave out, was with the object of looking for mineral deposits in Bostane. He has been as siduous in creating a connection with Oman, especially Dubai, where he has an Agent, and he has not scrupled to employ smugglers. The method followed was to bring coffee and other goods to the warehouses of Waunckhaus &amp; Co. in Lingah and declare them for transhipment: to ship them in a native craft in his employ nominally to Dubai, but really to have them rejanded up a place 6 miles from Lingah, whither they would be brought back by night. It is hoped that if a Vice Consul be appointed and a firm like Messrs. Gray Paul and Company prevailed by Government to compete strenuously with the German Company in all their lines of business, the position of Messrs. Waunck- hous &amp; Co., would soon be shaken in Lingah. Imports for 1907-08. —19,514 packages imported as against 26,664 in 1906- 07 and 9,172 packages exported as against 6,031 in 1906-07, The decreased import of loaf sugar has been explained above, but the Residency Agent reports that for the last few months Messrs. Sassoon have ceased to forward it, and Messrs. Waunckhaus &amp; Co. are beginning to sell again. It is hoped that this British firm will not retire from the business. The brand imported by the German firm is Belgian, bearing the mark U. T. O., with the inscription of the name of Waunckhaus &amp; Co., Lingah, Bahrein and Bushire in Persian. The retail price of the case was 2J Krans (app. lid) per Lingah man of 6\ lbs. Crystal sugar. —6,655 t&gt; a § s as against 5,298 brought by the Hamburg- American line in 1906-07.

Kerosene. —The annual Lingah consumption of this oil is about 12,000 cases, half of which goes to the interior in Laristan and Jahrum, and the rest is used for Lingah, and the small ports of the Persian and Arab coasts. In 1907-08 7,050 cases were imported by the German firm from Fiume. Actually there are about 2,500—3,000 cases of the German oil on hand in Lingah, none of other kinds. Piece-goods. —202 bales imported by the German line. There is nothing to show what number, if any, of these were of British manufacture. In any case it is improbable that anything except British cottons would be imported, were the direct British steamers to call. It would certainly contribute to spoiling the Germans’ business. The following samples are forwarded, but I am informed that these goods are not now in demand, and the German firrn change their samples frequently.

Exports. Save for its first 5 ships at the close of 1907, the German firm has been unable, on account of the bad harvest, to purchase grain (just as British firms) at Basrah, Mohammerah, and the figures show a falling off of 3,000 tons of barley with an increase of 2,000 tons of wheat. The other exports are insignifi cant. The last 3 steamers passed down river homeward bound without calling at Mohammerah. It is to be noted however that Messrs. Waunckhaus and Company have purchased on an 8 years’ lease a site on the Karun bank for a wharf. G. C. B. P., Simla.—No. C45 F. D.—18*6 09 - 54-—E.A.D'S.1909 SIMLA. FOREIO- 3 ST DE^^KTMEJSrr* SECRET.

In the conviction that the presence of the German line and company in the Gulf, if continued, is likely to damage the trade hitherto done by British firms, might it not be advisable to approach privately the firms mentioned, and suggest their endeavouring to arrange their shiT ments by British vessels only, during a trial year or two ? Were the British cargo taken away next year, and arrangements made for the calling of British ships at the smaller ports, the Hamburg-Amerika line would find their import cargoes heavily reduced. J (C.) By encouraging British Goods to compete with German Goods of the same class on the market. The third means of discouragement of the joint German enterprise, is to try to obtain, through the Board of Trade, British articles of manufacture to oust continental goods now in demand in Persia, which afford cargo to the German vessels. To enable the Board of Trade to get the best possible idea of these, samples are being forwarded • but these are several lines calling for special attention. Sugar has been mentioned. As illustrated by Kerosene. —As will be seen from the statistics, Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co. have imported from Fiume 35,550 cases to the Gulf ports last year, and 61,579 to Bussorah. The trade-mark of this Hungarian oil is two stars. Each case contains two tins of about 65 lb. weight each. The oil is believed to have been imported on a contract price for one year. His Majesty’s consul at Fiume writes that the rate of freiofit to the Gulf is \s. to Is. 2d. per case, subject to special rebates, and the approximate price per case is 3s. 6d. to 3s. 9d. At present, local prices in the Gulf are about 14 krans, equal, at present rate of exchange, about 5s. This would not leave much profit to the importers, so that it is most probable that they have a substantial rebate. The only other sources of importation of kerosene are the United States and Russia (via Odessa and Suez). The import of Russian oil has fallen off considerably of late years. At Bushire, 8,000 cases in 1904, 18,000 cases in 1905, nil in 190i&gt;, 2,000 cases in 1907. The brand (“ Anchor”) is, however, preferred by local Persians to any other for its quality. The American oil (“ Monkey ” brand) has gained a bad name in Bushire on account of the smoky light it affords. It is imported every year or so direct from New York by chartered steamer. In 1906, 158,850 cases were imported—20,100 to Muscat, 30,250 to Bahrein, 35,500 to Bushire, 73,000 to Mohammerah and Bussorah. Prices of this oil ha\e been forced down by German competition in 1909 to 13 krans per case, but its inferiority to the German prevents it from keeping the latter out of the market, as it should. The agents of the American brand are Gray, Paul, and Co., and it was hoped that they would have made better use of their agency for the Standard Oil Trust to (hi\e the Hungarian oil out of the market. Should the Ahwaz oil scheme prove profitable, there is little probability of foreign oil competing locally, but, meantime, Gray, Paul, and Co. might use their agency as a handle with w'hich to beat the German impoiters. Apparently the Burma Oil Company cannot compete, owmo - to some under standing arrived at with the Standard Oil Trust. Import of Indigo. The import to the three ports, Bushire, Bunder Abbas, Mohammerah, declined from 378 cases m 1906-7 to 162 cases, despite the activity in Shiraz of German agents for the two manufactories importing. This result may be attributed partly to the had state of 1 trade generally and partly to the conservatism of the native population, but there is no doubt that the Indian natural article is seriously threatened. In 1908 reference was made from Bushire to the Government of India, with a view to ascertain if the synthetic dye of the Badische Anilin Fabrik ” ought not to be construed as coming within the prohibition of the Persian tariff against imports containing aniline in any form. As aniline does not necessarily occur in the synthesis of indigo, the Govern ment of India decided that a protest could not be maintained on the ground of the prohibition. . ^ In consequence, it only remains to attempt to keep good quality dyes on the market by introducing them to importers in Persia, and the Commercial Intelligence Department m India are being asked to endeavour to stimulate merchants in Madras to put themselves in touch with the Shiraz and Ispahan consulates. A member of the firm pf E-sai and Sarkis, in Ispahan, who passed through Bushire in 1908, made a specific complaint of the lack of good quality Indian dyes there, whereas he had made a successful trial with the German indigo. OBushire customs returns show :— 1 March 1906-7. March 1907-8. 1908-9 (niue months). India Cwts. 1,444 Cwts. 2,160 Cwts. 600 Germany .. 76 264 117 Export of Tobacco (Tombaku). Attention is drawn to the export of tobacco from Bush ire, now practically a monopoly in the bauds of the “ Societe de Tombac ” of Constantinople. In the Persian fiscal year 1907-8 this amounted to 19,506 bags, or 336,618 batmans—nearly 20,000 cwt. In addition to the Turkish monopoly the Egyptian monopoly export from Persia amounted in the same period to 2,240 bags = 2,108 cwts. The annual carriage of 1,100 tons freight is a matter of some interest to shipping companies. The agency of the “ societe ” at Bushire has been for some years past with the Russian steam-ship company’s agency, who retain the tobacco as far as possible for their vessels. At one period in 1908 it seemed as if the steam-ship service and agency would both be withdrawn altogether, but apparently the Russian Government subsidy has been again voted. In any case, a considerable amount of the tobacco has to be given by the Russian agents as freight to other lines, by reason of the paucity of their own sailings. The British combine has thus benefited largely from the friendly terms on which it has stood with the Russian steamer agents. But the German agent at Bushire has already attempted in 1908 to obtain the tobacco for his ships. Herr Heinicke has this year been named agent at Shiraz for the Societe ” vice a British subject, and similarly at Mohammerab the agency has been lately transferred from Lynch Brothers to Ter Meulen, Gratama, and Co., a Dutch firm, who are shippers in German boats. In June last the Bushire agents of the Anglo-Algerian line wrote to the director of the “ Societe de Tombac ” at Constantinople asking for preference shipment by his steamers. The reply was a non-committal one. Desiderata put forward in 1906-7 Deport. Of the various points brought forward and recommendations made in 1907 only No. 2 has been actively taken up as yet, viz., the lighterage from British steamers in British owned lighters. Lighterage Company at Bushire. Some progress has been made at Bushire towards the establishment of a lighterage company. The British India Company’s agents received instructions at the end of 1908 to have six sailing lighters built, and in February 1909 orders to undertake the lighter age of their own” steamers at a rate of 2 r. 8 a.^3s. 4t/. per ton, the other British shippinp’ companies having apparently not yet joined them in the venture. Hie measure has created a little resentment amongst lightermen and merchants owing to the high rate charged and suddenness of the step, but this will die down. The sooner the Ancdo-Algerian and Bombay-Persian companies decide to join the movement, the easier will the position become, and it is again urged that a small steam-tug lighter will make all the difference, both for speed on the many windless days of the year, and for proving to the natives the superiority of the new scheme. Other Branches of German Activity. Apart from the subjects discussed above, there were several other features of German interest in these regions during the year under review. Commercial Mission of Herr Kurt Jung. This official was dispatched in the capacity of commercial delegate of the German Empire to make an exhaustive study of trade conditions in Southern and Eastern [2306 9—19] D10 Persia with the object of putting German commerce in direct relations with various Persian centres. He visited Yezd, Kerman, Bunder Abbas, Bahrein, Bushire, and Shiraz in succession. At Bushire he inspected the bazaars, obtained statistics from the customs, anci interviewed the principal merchants; to one of them he announced his intention d seeing that on his return to Germany more inducement was offered to direct trade between Persian and German merchants by better credits being offered in Germany. While in Shiraz he manifested to Mr. Grahame particular interest in the consumption of sugar in the Shiraz district. In expressing his concurrence with the pessimistic views of the commercial outlook held by the German merchant in Shiraz he regretted “ that he should yet be called upon to write in an optimistic vein.” The Export of Red Oxide from Island of Abu Musa. The German Government were successful in obtaining for Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co. the acquiescence of His Majesty’s Government on behalf of the Sheikh of Shargah to their removing the oxide accumulated previous to suspension of the disputed lease by the Sheikh of Shargah, and the steam-ship “ Louise ” took away some 1,800 tons in 1908. The knowdedge that German influence w T as also at work at Tehran with a view to securing rights in connection with the more valuable deposits on the island of Hormuz goes to prove that, apart from any political and strategic designs, the German element is bent on securing a portion, or the whole, of the red oxide trade in order to provide a further stand by for the business of both Wonckhaus and the Hamburg- Amerika line. The question of the supply of the demand for red oxide seems likely to be complicated by the fact that many islands in the Gulf besides the two above mentioned contain deposits of the mineral, though of varying quality. German Agent at Bushire Norwegian Vice-Consul. The appointment of the German agent of Wonckhaus and Co. at Bushire as Norwegian vice-consul has no bond fide justification, for Norway has no imports or exports to and from Southern Persia. It is understood that there has been a similar German appointment at Tehran. At Bushire the measure would appear to be solely designed as a means of putting a German firm in a more advantageous position than English firms, while strengthening the hand of the German vice-consulate.

J In considering the increased import cargo—26,013 packages as against 10,808 packages in 1906-7—it will be noticed that 15,000 cases of these contained kerosene from Eiume, an item which may or may not reappear in subsequent years, as depends on the measures taken by other importers of oil. Similarly 5,100 bags of sugar from Hamburg are accounted for by an unwonted opportunity of placing Russian crystals on the Bushire market which is not likely to recur often.

Samples of these are at present unobtainable Irom Ispahan.* Loaf Sugar. —Import by German steamer increased from 720 to 820 cases, of which 800 were imported by the German agency. The brand is U. T.

The demand in this climate is only for beers of the lightest nature, but we should like to see the experiment tried of a light English beer of the nature of Wrexham lager, or even lighter, if the Commercial Intelligence Department can state where such a beer can be obtained. Sample No. 9— A specimen bottle of Wonckhaus’ light coloured Pilsener beer of the Pilsener-Urquell brand.

Betail price Bushire c.i.f. 22 rupees per case of four dozen (not sent). Drugs and Chemicals .—One hundred and seventy-one cases of drugs were imported in German steamers in 1907-8 as against 120 cases in 1906-7. Thirty-seven cases, with a total value of 22,400 krans, were exported from Hamburg by Koch and Berniers and forwarded to the “ Pharmacie Militaire ” in Tehran. _ His Majesty’s vice-consul at Tehran has been asked whether this military pharmacy is under German management, and if not, it might be possible to introduce a British firm exporting chemist’s goods to * See Addenda, p. 16. t Not reproduced. [2306 g —19] E14 the management of the “ Pharmacie.”* The other 140 cases were almost all consigned to chemists in Tehran, e.g., the German chemist Schwerin, the French Maulion, and the Armenian Carnick Dalguidjian. Firms exporting from Hamburg were Koch and Reimers, and Blembel Gebruder, medicaments particularly mentioned being chlorate oi potash and vaseline (twenty-five cases). An invoice of the vaseline shipped by J. D. Riedel, “ Aktiengesellschaft,” in Berlin for the German chemist in Tehran gives three cases “ white ” vaseline, 80 kilog. weight, size 120 X 36 X 30 centim. Each case holds fourteen tins of 5 kilog. each and costs, with discount, 60'20 marks = 3/. 0 s. 2d. Another three cases contained each 130 tinsof half a kilog. each, costing, with discount, 66'95 marks = 3/. 6.s. 9^d. There is a flourishing trade for chemists in Tehran, and perhaps British exporters could be given good introductions there. Paper. —One hundred and seventy bales of paper were imported to Bushire from Germany in 1907-8 as against 186 bales- in 1906-7, nearly all destined for Tehran, the market for papers in Persia. Of the former twenty-nine cases printing paper were consigned to the &lt;c Imprimerie Pharos” in Tehran by Fertsch and Laeisz, of Hamburg, and sixteen bales wrapping paper to the German chemist in Tehran by Koch and Reimers. An invoice for wrapping paper supplied by J. D. Riedel, “ Aktiengesellschaft,” in Berlin, to Tehran, gives prices for two cases of 87 and 88 kilog. each containing 730 sheets as 70TO marks = 3/. 10s. 10(7. per 1,460 sheets. Kahn and Kahn also exported seventy-four bales of paper, presumably for printing purposes, and we notice the name of James Spicer and Sons exporting twenty bales. There seems no reason why all the considerable amount of paper required annually in Tehran should not be English, instead of German. Perhaps British paper manufacturers and firms could be put in direct touch with buyers in Tehran instead of applying to Bushire, where there is no market; J 4o packages at least of the total went through without breaking bulk, so that samples are not available here.'f Linseed and Turpentine. —Out of 97 drums of turpentine and linseed imported 53 were brought from Hamburg to the order of a British subject in Bushire. As regards turpentine, the drums hold, some 5 gallons and some 10 gallons, and the value of the total 53 drums was 41/. 17s. They were for use on the Persian Customs launches. The present prices at which they were bought are 2s. 6d. per gallon, and the second quality 2.9. 2d. per gallon, c.i.fi, Bushire. The British subject in question will probably require some 200 gallons during 1909, and would like to know English quotations. Glassware. —Ninety-eight cases imported as against twenty-eight in 1906-7. Sixteen cases of the former (with a total declared value of 6,565 krans) were procured by Messrs. Ziegler and Co. to the order of the Ahdieh Company in Shiraz from i\J essrs. Yairon and Co. and Tschakert and Co. in Hamburg. Of these His Majesty’s consul at Shiraz informs us that five cases were tall glass candle-stands with elongated glass shades, each case containing twenty to twenty-five stands or shades; two cases contained coloured glass tumblers with saucers to match, for which there is some sale in Shiraz. Sample No. 11.—Tumbler with saucer. Retail price 10 krans. Two cases contained thick glass trays. Samp e No. 12.—Thick glass tray. Retail price in Shiraz 18 krans each. (N.B.—Both these samples bear the mark of the Compagnie des Cristalleries de Baccarat.) Six other cases contained large flower-holders 2 feet and 1 foot high, sold in sets, but almost all still unsold. There is in ordinary years a certain sale for flower- stands and vases in Shiraz and Ispahan, and another British firm has been trying Bohemian-made glass this year in Shiraz. Some English glass-making firms might be recommended to Messrs. Ziegler in this connection. Thirty-four crates and cases of glassware, chiefly tumblers, decanters (total value of 100/. 9.9. 3d.) were also brought by Messrs. Gray, Dawes, and Co. from Hamburg for a customer in Bushire. I much doubt if this order is likely to be repeated. Lampiuare .— Nine cases went through to Tehran, bulk unbroken, value of the same being 3,850 krans. China and earthenware .—Import of seventy-five cases. Thirty-nine of these were manifested as porcelain plates and twenty-four cases as crockery shipped by Alois Schweiger and. Co., of Hamburg, and bills of lading consigned to the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China at Bombay, and forwarded to Shiraz. They were, it is understood, a sort of desert or fruit plate, with a portrait of the Shah in the centre. No samples available at Bushire. * C See Addenda, p. 17. f Ibid., p. 17.* See Addenda, p. 17. Antwerp Cargo. » Cotton goods. —368 bales imported in 1907-8 as against 171 bales in 1906-7. Of w ^se 323 bales were imports on consignment by Messrs. Ziegler and Co. from G. J. van Heek and Zonen of Enschede in Holland, with a total value of 140,495 krans (2,554/.), being drills and cambrics of Dutch manufacture, which have had a constant market in Ispahan for some years past. There is no sale for them in Bushire and Shiraz, and they do not break bulk. Sample Ao. 13.—Cambrics “ Peacock” brand, 16 yards per piece, 44 inches wide, costing 4s. )d. per piece c.i.f. Sample No. 14, - Cambrics “ Lion and Sun” brand, 16 yards per piece, 44 inches wide, costing 4s. Id. per piece c.i.f. Bushire. Sample No. 15.—Black drills, 26 inches wide, 40 yards per piece, at 9s. 2d. per piece c.i.f. Bushire.* Sample No. 16.—Grey drills, 28 inches wide, 40 yards per piece, at 9s. per piece c.i.f. Bush ire. To the last prices has to be added lOrf. per piece, packing, for freight and insurance. Perhaps the Board of Trade would consider the possibility of either (l) putting some Manchester firm up to a trial of British drills and cambrics, vying in quality and as cheap in price as these Dutch goods, which ought not to have this constant market in Persia; or (2) ascertaining whether Messrs. Ziegler would change their source of supply. (See also under Mohammerah). Of the remaining bales from Antwerp, thirty-nine bales were shipped by the Holland Bombay Trading Company (Limited) to Shiraz, and have not yet been traced on the market. Candles—Total imports to Gulf ports in 1906-7 was 1,898 cases (Bushire 800 cases), and to Bushire in 1907-8. 1,100 cases. These are specially consigned by Traun, Strucken and Co., of Hamburg, the principals of Wonckhaus and Co., to the latter for sale. They are stearine candles from the Apollo manufactory at Schiedam, in Holland, and are in two brands. Sample No. 17.—“ Paragon,” thirty packets of six candles per case. Wholesale price in Bushire, 28 krans. . Sample No. 18 .— &lt;s Excelsior,” thirty packets of six candles per case. Wholesale price, Bushire, 26&lt;=r krans. In January 1909 the retail price of the latter was 25 krans per case, customs duty lying with the'local buyer (almost another 2 krans). These Dutch stearine candles are more heavily priced than the Burmah Oil Company’s wax candles to the extent of 3 or 4 krans per case, but there is always a good sale for stearme candles for use in the Gulf in preference to wax candles on account of the susceptibility of the latter to die heat. Another point about this import of stearine candles is that they all seen, to be made in Holland in Schiedam or Amsterdam, but bear the marks of different importing firms. Thus until lately Messrs. D. Sassoon and Co. were large importers of a brand also made at the Apollo factory in Schiedam. The Customs statistics for the year March 1906-7 and March 1907-8 show 1,221 and 1,473 cwts. respectively, coming from Europe valued at 2 648/ and 3 488/ If there are manufacturers of stearme candies m the United Kingdom, would the Board of Trade think it advisable to put them in communication with British firms trading in the Gulf, so as, if possible, to lessen the need of British firms going to Holland for the article ? , , r , , Window-glass —hollowing are figures lor the last two years by German steamers only :— Bushire ..

Call for no special mention, and are unimportant. The 700 bags of raisins were exported by Herr Heinicke, the German trader in Shiraz, direct to New York, -where he seems to have a small but regular market. The rose-water and tobacco were for the Red Sea only. The opium and gum tragacanth (largely) were exports for London shipped by Persians, but it may be noted that Messrs. Ziegler exported some 150 chests of opium during 1907-8 from Ispahan to a German merchant in Darmstadt. Addenda. Velvet and Plushes, p. 1 3. Sample No. 6, (a). Plush, 18 inches wide.

Taking the Hamburg-American Company’s freioht for arms to be 120 marks per case of arms and ammunition, this alone will have benefit^ them to the extent of some 31,446/. Any measures taken internationally as a resul of the Arms Conference towards prohibiting the import into Muscat would, therefore seriously damage any profits which the German Shipping Company make on their run up the Gulf, and materially aid us in the object in view, viz., the discouragement of that company from competition with British ships in the Persian Gulf. Cotton Goods. —Five hundred and fifty-one bales of American sheeting were imported from Aden—where they had come from New York—as against 597 bales in 1906-7. About 1,000 to 1,200 bales of this sheeting are said to be consigned annually from Aden to Muscat, almost always for sale on shippers’ account, the latter in 1907-8 being the Indian firm in Aden, Haji Alibhoy Jumma, Lalji and Co. 85 bales, and Menham Messa 436 bales. The freight per bale from Aden to Muscat is 1 r. 8 a. to 3 r. 8 a. by the British lines, and 1 r. 8 a. to 3 r. 4 a. by the German lines, but weight depends on the number shipped. Private arrangements are entered into with the shipping agents, and the British is generally higher than the German rate by 4 to 6 annas. The Political Resident at Aden has now been asked to use his good offices privately with the shippers in order to encourage them to give the British lines calling at Aden the benefit of their shipments to Muscat. Apart from the question of discouraging shipments from Aden to Muscat by the German line, there is the question of replacing these goods in Aden and Muscat by Manchester goods, which does not come into the scope of this report. For the informa tion of the Board of Trade, it is noted that these American sheetings have been on the market in Muscat now for a number of years. There are about ten to fifteen difierent qualities imported, twenty-five pieces of 30 yards to the bale.

Imports by the Hamburg-American line rose from 5,247 to 17,685 packages. Of this, no less than 14,368 were bundles of iron and steel bars and iron plates. I am informed that these were mostly shipped from Antwerp, and not Hamburg, to British Indian (Hindu) firms, who apparently obtained these goods by sending orders through British firms in Karachi, e.g., Forbes, Forbes and Co., Macdonald and Co., Volkart Brothers, and E. D. Sassoon and Co., and also Messrs. Gray, Paul and Co.’s agency at Bushire. The names of the chief Hindu consignees in Bunder Abbas are :— Hukmatrai Mohandas. Hasanand Chetandas. Tharoomal Badhakshin. Messrs. Gray, Paul, and Co. at Bushire state that the stuff ordered through them by the first-named Hindu was principally Swedish iron and basic steel, obtained fromMessrs. E. W. McClellan and Co. (Limited), 108, Cannon Street, London. The invoiced prices of these (presumably f.o.b.

These metals are used for building in Bunder Abbas, and the import is likely to be well maintained in succeeding years, the annual demand amounting to about 4,000 cwts. valued at nearly 3,000/. I was informed in January 1909 that other consignments, that had been ordered out, were coming by German steamers. The markets supplied are Yezd, Kerman, Sirjan, Lar, Darab, and local. The Board of Trade will be able to judge of the possibility of putting English steel and iron on the market in Bunder Abbas as cheap as the Belgian or Swedish article, in which case Messrs. Forbes, Forbes, Macdonald, and Co., Messrs. Gray, Dawes, and Co., the other firms and Hindu traders mentioned, seem the best people to canvass. Almost all the 14,368 bundles mentioned were brought during the last five or six months of the period covered by this report, i.e ., during the period the British combine had made an agreement with the Hamburg-American line to call at Antwerp and Hamburg. In the same space of time no steamers of the British combine landed any metals at Bunder Abbas, and only 143 bundles of iron were imported from British India Steam Navigation Company’s boats. This fact only serves to accentuate the undesira bility, from the British point of view, of the English lines concluding any rate or pool agreement with a foreign line by which the former are debarred from calling at such a port as Antwerp, for it gives foreign trade an opportunity for a foothold in Bunder Abbas. It has been observed that the tendency is for direct trade between the Gulf ports and Europe to increase annually, and for the trade with India to decrease or not advance. And so it is an anomaly to find Bunder Abbas, which is specially designated as being the British sphere of influence, relying for its direct trade with Europe in an article like iron, on ships of a foreign nation now carrying on an active competition against British trade. So far, Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co. have not established a regular agency in Bunder Abbas, but there have been reports of their intention to send one of their assistants there, and it is expected that they will do so as soon as telegraphic communication is started with other ports. Messrs. Gray, Paul, and Co. have been often urged to post one of their European staff in Bunder Abbas for some months each year, and should Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co. open business, this would become a matter of necessity as far as our commercial interests in that port are concerned. In Lingah we are now experiencing much incon-Imports. I British trade is seriously handicapped in these islands by the fact that no steamers / of the British lines importing goods direct from Europe call there, the reason giv^ being that the deviation from the direct course from Muscat to Bushire, and the tiJf spent in the anchorage at Bahrein, is too expensive in proportion to the freight obtained to make it worth their while under actual conditions. Before the advent of the German company this attitude did not inflict any special damage on British imports to the islands, for the British India Steam Navigation Company had practically the whole of the carrying trade, but now the very considerable amount of cargo brought direct from Europe each year is borne by German ships only. It is superfluous to dilate on the evil influence this has on the trade in goods of British origin, or on the undesirability of an Arab island under British protection having to rely for its intercourse with Great Britain on the regular monthly German steamers. If it cannot pay the English steamers to call, it presumably must be a dead loss for the Hamburg steamers to do so. The inference drawn is that the subsidy made to the German line alone permits it to undertake expenses attendant on calling regularly at Bahrein, Bunder Abbas, and Lingah. It is hardly to be wondered at that the agents of the German line lose no oppor- tunity of hampering the operations of their rivals, when shipping or receiving conshm- ments by the German steamers. According to a good source of information, the freight on shells exported by Wonckhaus and Co. and their clients, is allowed by the shipping line a rebate of Is. per ton less than the freight accorded to the British firm, Gray, Paul, and Co. and their clients. I 1. On one occasion in 1908, when the German steamer brought to Bahrein a laroe amount of sugar and other goods for both Gray, Paul, and Co. and Wonckhaus and Co., the latter s cargo was landed and the British company’s over-carried to Bushire, under the pretext of stress of weather. This enabled the German firm to get their cargo on the market first, and involved the British company in considerable loss. When the claim was made to the German steamer agents m Bahrein they declined to consider it, maintaining that under the bill of lading Messrs. Gray, Paul, and Co. would have to fight their case in Hamburg. xj. A second claim made by Gray, Paul, and Co. with reference to bags of sugar certified to have been torn when taken from a German vessel was met by the German agents with the same reply. 3. Giay, Paul, and Co. appear unable to compete in such an important line as piece goods, although, according to the steamer’s manifests, ninety-four bales of English cottons were imported direct by German steamers, due to the large rebate of 5s. per ton oflered for English cotton goods sent to Hamburg for transhipment. Only two hales of these were for Messrs. Gray, Paul, and Co. . V ie u P s J 10 ^.°f the case in Bahrein is that the British firm find it irksome to have leu import business from Europe direct in the hands of a German shipping company whose agents and proteges, Wonckhaus, are their own chief opponents. The writer recently saw a letter from Messrs: Gray, Dawes, and Co. in reply to an enquirv by the Bahrein agency whether they could arrange for shipments of sugar in other than ] Heiman ships. They explained that they had no choice in the matter : the freight bv British steamer to India being S6s. per ton, by Austrian Lloyd transhipment in India and British India Steam Navigation Company 326-., and by Hamburg American steamer only 26s. 6d. per ton. 6 A regular call at Bahrein (Lingah and Bunder Abbas) by the AnMo-Algerian and °t er companies directly serving the Gulf would solve most of these questions ; and in connection with the recent endeavour of the Board of Trade commissioner to arrange lor the establishment of sample rooms, at considerable cost to the Government, bv which nig is 1 goods would be pushed on the Gulf markets, it should be remembered that the sc erne is ikely to be nullified in Bahrein and Lingah unless it can be arranged for such goods to come direct from Great Britain in British ships.

One thousand to 1,500 packages is estimated to cover Bahrein’s import per month from Europe, and there would seem to be no reason why continental sugar, at any rate, should not be brought in British ships, provided there is no transhipment. Crystal Sugar. —As stated in the Bushire report on the import of sugar to the Gulf the crystal, par preference in this and other ports, is E. A. B., an Austrian brand, shipped from a depot in Hamburg. Bahrein, like most Arab ports, is more partial to crystal than loaf sugar, and more than anywhere else it offers the best prospects for reviving the import of British sugar from Mauritius. The Bahrein agent of Messrs. Gray, Paul, and Co. has been able to book orders for some 1,000 bags in the last few months, and writes that he hopes to be in a position to put through a fairly large business. But until they can turn out in Mauritius crystals of a larger size and whiter- colour, more like the Austrian E. A. It., a large supply of this latter is certain to continue in demand in the various ports.

Wonckhaus and Co. For this the British combine is largely to blame, since, as in the case of Bahrein, their ships do not call at Lingah, and all direct intercourse with Europe is thus confined to the regular monthly arrivals of the Hamburg American steamers. It used to be thought that the needs of the smaller Gulf ports could best be supplied from India by the weekly steamers of the British India Steam Navigation Company and the Bombay Persian line, and that it was unjustifiable expense for the home-going English lines to share in the carrying trade. This idea has been exploded by the operations of the German subsidized line, for it is plain that a great part of the trade has been deviated from India to Europe by the fact that many necessaries, e.g., sugai, &amp;c., can be put on the market in Lingah as cheaply as, sometimes cheaper than, goods imported via India. ^ The reason is not far to seek when it is considered how heavy the British India freight rates are from Bombay to Lingah. At Lingah, as at Bahrein, the German agents of the Hamburg American line have not been slow to use their monopoly of direct European trade to harass their English rivals, and it is at Lingah there appears to be a good opportunity for the British firm to force Mauritius sugar, which is carried in English ships, on to the market, but unless some special arrangements for very low freight can be made with the British India - Vlg ^T ! Jom P an T’ the difference in price c.i.f. between it and the Auscrian E.A.K., which is the standard by reason of its white colour and the size of the crystals, is too small to enable it to capture more than a small portion of the trade. It is disquieting to hear such frequent reports both from natives and Europeans of the manner m which the German firm now “ run ” Lingah, and the present situation may thus be summed up :— Lmgah ceased to be an important port with the enforcement of the Persian customs tariff by the Belgian administration, the trade having largely transferred itself to Dubai, on the Arab coast; but inasmuch as the institution of the German service has opened a direct trade between Europe and Lingah (which Dubai has not got) business m Lmgah has slightly recovered. There are, however, no native firms there with any reserve capital and up till lately on]y a native agency of Gray, Paul, and Co. W onckhaus and Go., with a manager and two German assistants, are thus left without any real competitors. It is interesting to note the remarks made on the latter s methods of business by the Besidency agent (a very shrewd Arab and a trader himself) :— (Translation.) “ Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co., whenever they import any merchandise, and Lmgah merchants have already got similar goods in stock, lower the price and sell it. No native merchant who has thus imported goods will sell them at a loss as long as he is able to stand out; but after having waited for some time he is obliged to, and sells at a loss. He does not import that merchandise a second time, but buys those goods fromWonckhaus and Co. But if a large firm were to take steps to import merchandise, Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co. will be obliged to curtail their own business, since they know that such a large firm will not stop importing a particular line because it has once dropped money on a transaction. ,, He then gives an instance in point : In the first year of steamers’sailings 5,772 cases and bags of loaf-sugar were imported, as will be seen in last year’s report ; this year 011 ly 1,307. He induced David Sassoon and Co. (Limited) to send a large consignment of sugar ; the Germans lowered the prices ; Messrs. Sassoon maintained theirs. The Germans sold at a loss, and finally closed their business in sugar for the time being. He concludes :— “ In my opinion, if a firm of good standing were to begin to bring merchandise to Lingah, and shut their eyes to profits for one year, without doubt Wonckhaus and Co. will have to close up their business altogether. Even though that firm were to suffer losses in the first year, yet in the second year they would make up for it.” These recommendations of his cannot be too strongly urged on the principals of such a firm as Gray, Paul, and Co. (Gray, Dawes, and Co). After repeated representa tions from Major Cox during the last year they deputed to Lingah in the autumn a Eurasian from among the number of their subordinate staff—a man of mediocre capacity not equal to competition with the German representative. It is doubtful if there is sufficient trade in Lingah for two European firms, and the British firm might well consider the advisability of ousting the German firm out of the place by fighting the Germans on their own trade ground. At present this is hardly being attempted. When the Manchester partner of the firm of Haji Ali Akbar and Sons (Limited) (of London and Manchester) was making a tour early in 1908 in Southern Persia, in the course of which he had booked important orders during his journey from Bunder Abbas via Lar to Lingah, he expressed, whde in Bushire, a desire to open an agency of his firm (which is a considerable exporter of Manchester cottons to Persia) in Lingah. At the same time he urged the importance of expediting the appointment of a consular officer at Lingah, where he had gained the impression that British trade interests were at present inadequately represented. There is unfortunately a good deal of truth in this remark largely owing to the undesirable influence acquired in Lingah by Mr. Brown (the manager of Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co.) and his anti-British tendencies. Mr. Brown, who is the son of Scotch parents born in Germany, will be remembered as taking a prominent part in the Abu Musa affair, in which his efforts have materially assisted the German case. During the existence of a local Medjliss in Lingah Mr. Brown meddled openly in Persian politics and took part in the discussions with a view to displaying the German support of the constitutional movement. He has given credits of such liberality, and in many cases so forgiven natives’ unpaid debts, that he has bound many Arab traders to support the German firm exclusively, while at the same time these unbusinesslike transactions have strengthened the conviction of British firms in the Gulf, that Wonckhaus and Co. must be covered by financial support in Germany in order to make these losses and yet contrive to do business on their present lines. While the writer was at Lingah in December 1908 Mr. Brown and his assistants had started on a short tour in the interior, which, they gave out, was with the object of looking for mineral deposits in Bostane. He has been assiduous in creating a connection with Oman, especially Dubai, where he has an agent, and he has not scrupled to employ smugglers. The method followed was to bring coffee and other goods to the warehouses of Wonckhaus and Co. in Lingah and declare them for transhipment, to ship them in a native craft in his employ nominally to Dubai, but really to have them re-landed up a place 6 miles from Lingah, whither they would be brought back by night. It is hoped that if a vice-consul be appointed, and a firm like Messrs. Gray, Paul and Co. can be prevailed by Government to compete strenuously with the German company in all their lines of business, the position of Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co. would soon be shaken in Lingah. Imp rts for 1907-08. Nineteen thousand five hundred and fourteen packages imported, as against 26,664 in 1906-7, and 9,172 packages exported, as against 6,031 in 1906-7. The decreased import of loaf sugar has been explained above, but the Residency [3206 g —19] I28 agent reports that for the last few months Messrs. Sassoon have ceased to forward it, and Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co. are beginning to sell again. It is hoped that this British firm will not retire from the business. The brand imported by the German firm is Belgian, bearing the mark “ U. T. 0.^ with the inscription of the name of Wonckhaus and Co., Lingah, Bahrein, and Bushi^ in Persian. The retail price of the case was 2J krans (approximately lid.) per Lingah nan of 6J- lbs. Crystal Suqar. —Six thousand six hundred and fifty-five bags, as against 5,293 brought by the Hamburg-American line in 1906-7. Of these a proportion belonged to Gray, Paul, and Co. Those imported by the German firm are of two kinds, each bag weighing 2 cwt. Sample No. 48 (not sent).—Costs 23 r. 8 a. per bag. Sample No. 49 (not sent).—Costs 22 rupees to 22 r. 8 a. per bag. Three-quarters of this sugar were forwarded for sale in Jahrum and Laristan, the remaining quarter to Shibkuh ports on the Persian coast, and to the Oman ports on the Arab coast. Kerosene .—The annual Lingah consumption of this oil is about 12,000 cases, half of which goes to the interior in Laristan and Jahrum, and the rest is used for Lingah and the small ports of the Persian and Arab coasts. In 1907-8 7,050 cases were imported by the German firm from Fiume. Actually there are about 2,500-3,000 cases of the German oil on hand in Lingah, none of other kinds. Piece Goods .—Two hundred and two bales imported by the German line. There is nothing to show what number, if any, of these were of British manufacture. In any case it is improbable that anything except British cottons would be imported, were the direct British steamers to call. It would certainly contribute to spoiling the Germans’ business. The following samples are forwarded, but l am informed that these goods are not now in demand, and the German firm change their samples frequently. Their principal business would appear to be in loin clock (“ langoute ” in Persian) which are always in demand. Sample No. 50.—“ Langoute,” loin cloth, red and black; price per twenty 15 rupees cash in Lingah. (Other types enclosed.) Sample No. 51.—“Langoute,” loin cloth, white; price ner twenty 6 rupees = 8.9. Sample No. 52.—(cr.)

All the cargo, except that to Aden, is Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co.’s own consignment, it is understood. The only matter calling for serious attention is the heavy extent to which the German export shells. \30 2. An increase in the bundles of wood for date boxes imported from 3,700 to 9,600. This wood was consigned to a Jew in Bussorah, who packs dates near Mohammerah, and as a rule is Swedish or from Fiume. The agent for the Government of Mysore Forest Department has made several inquiries of the consulate to know if he can place, Indian wood on the Gulf market, and the opportunity will now be taken to ascertai^ if he can produce any articles as cheap as the common white Swedish or Fiume pine wood, for which there is a very large demand every year in Bussorah during the date season. 3. An increase in the import of crystal and loaf sugar from 2,750 bags and 1,750 cases to 5,049 bags and 300 cases. Of this increased amount 2,000 bags were, I am informed, consigned to Ter Meulen Gratama and Co., the Dutch firm in Ahwaz ; 2,150 bags was crystal sugar ordered by Mohammerah native merchants from Hamburg. Cotton goods .—Quite 296 bales of piece goods and covers of the total amount imported were imported by the Dutch firm Ter Meulen and Gratama in Ahwaz, and are manufactures of Van Heek and Zonen, of Enschede in Holland. (See reference to cotton goods under Bushire heading.) Apparently their native agent in Ispahan used to sell them there, but they have lately, I am told, been debarred from competition with Ziegler’s for these Dutch goods. Tea. —This, curiously enough, is also an import by the Dutch firm from Holland, eighty-six chests being sent up to Ahwaz. Exports. Save for its first five ships at the close of 1907 the German firm has been unable on account of the bad harvest, to purchase grain (just as British firms), at Bussorah, Mohammerah, and the figures show a falling off of 3,000 tons of barley, with an increase of 2,000 tons of wheat. The other exports are insignificant. The last five steamers passed down river homeward bound without calling at Mohammerah. It is to be noted, however, that Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co. have purchased on an eight years’ lease a site on the Karun bank for a wharf. H. G. C. cCopy. (23691). 9, KING STREET, ST. JAMES'S, S.W., July 8th, 1908. Sir;- Some months have now elapsed since I first had the honour to direct the attention of His Majesty’s Government to some serious negotiations that were taking place between the Hamburg-Amerlcan Line and the British combined steamer Lines operating In the Persian Gulf. The direct object of these negotiations which, it may be remembered, were Instituted by the Hamburg- American Line and not by the British Lines, was the formation of a pool into which the interests of both parties should be merged for a certain period. The Indirect object of the Hamburg-American Line was, however, to obtain a truce from competition during a time of depression and financial stringency which, if but temporary, was being severely felt by them in the early part of this year, and was dictating Sir E. Grey, Bart., M.P., Sic., &lt;3tC., 8cC. eithereither a policy of withdrawal from those districts which were not yielding satisfactory returns, or the adoption of measures calculated to reassure their shareholders and obtain further subsidies from the German Government. The declaration that a rate agreement had been concluded with their most formidable competitors was obviously calculated to quiet critlcism,and was clearly the cause of the over tures made to the British Combine, Having brought to the notice of His Majesty’s Government the undesirability of concluding such an arrangement at such a time, I was authorised by letter to verbally express to the British Combine the concern with which His Majesty’s Government re garded the steps about to be taken, considering as they did such an arrangement to be detrimental to British interests in the Persian Gulf. Upon this, the British Combine ceased communication with the Hamburg-American Line until the matter should be fur ther considered. The impending agreement was success fully postponed more than once in consequence of the representationsrepresentations made, and when correspondence was event a ally resumed in the month of June between the two paroles, it was found that the Hamburg-American Line had altered their proposals for a pool to a proposal for a rate agreement. Although in theory the latter proposition was not likely to be so detrimental to our interests as the former, it was clearly shown both to His Majes ty s Government and the British Combine that a rate agreement contained elements that were likely to re act most favourably to the German export trade and most unfavourably to the British export trade. Notwithstanding this, an understanding has been recently arrived at in the nature of a rate agree ment,and this, whilst containing nothing of a bind ing or permanent character, will certainly re-act harmfully upon our commercial Interests in the Gulf. Whilst it may be argued that this result was more or less inevitable, it is well to point out that the first outcome of this arrangement has been to aug- — ment largely the outward rates of freight to the PersianPersian Gulf, and consequently to check to a certain extent the flow of exports from Great Britain to the Gulf, as also to curtail the distance to which Brit ish imports can profitably penetrate into the Per sian markets. Quits apart, then, from the more ser ious and indirect adverse Influence that such an agreement is likely to have in the future upon our general position in the Gulf, the immediate effects are to retard the free flow of imports into the Gulf and to strengthen our most formidable competitors at a moment when continued competition would have gone far wo vveaken their position against those respons ible for the British transport trade. The present condition ol affairs cannot, I sub mit, be considered as anything but extremely unsatis factory and regrettable, and constitutes a situation whose duration should be allowed to continue as short a time as possible. In view of the present situation, I venture to express ohe opinion that it is very necessary for His Majesty’s Government to take some active steps to assist the British Companies to carry on and main tainmaintain their lines of open commercial communica tion against the subsidised competition with which they are faced. This is necessary unless His Majes ty's Government is willing to see the line of Brit ish communications in the Gulf very seriously weak ened and possibly permanently impaired. A study of the economic situation in the Middle East and the Persian Gulf, however, yields conclu sions which are now impossible of application. Russia has a virtual monopoly in the trade of North ern Persia, and has recently acquired a preponderat ing influence over the important markets of Central Persia, and in view of this as well as the fact that she maintains and stimulates this trade by subsi dies and by the actual closure of the Trans-Caucasian transit trade to foreign nations, it would be natural to conclude that the maritime nations trading in the Persian Gulf, viz., England and Geraany, who are mainly responsible for the ingress of trade from the South, should form a close combination of interests againsu Russia with the object of energetically drivingdriving their trade inwards from the South to com pete with and to repel the subsidised trade from the North. This natural conclusion is, however, impos sible of application owing to a variety of circum stances, not the least of which are the grave dan gers and actual losses that are incurred by British Steamship Lines in any rate agreements concluded with Germany, and to the practically Indiscernible deceptions and lack of faith under such agreements which the system of internal subsidised transport and subsidised export in Gennany allows to its beneficiaries. There exist also other dangers which would inevitably threaten British trade as a result of rate agreements concluded with Germany at the present time, but which are perhaps unnecessary to describe herewith. If then British trade is being exterminated by Russian subsidies in Northern Persia, menaced by the same methods in Central Persia, and seriously imper illed by German subventloned trade in the Persian Gulf and Mesopotamian markets, and if it be further conceded% conceded that rate agreements with Gennany do serve no other purpose than to Increasingly facilitate the effective operation of the methods of subsidy at present employed in Germany, there can, I submit, be no other course for His Majesty's Government to pursue but to use and apply the same methods for the uia.ntenaace of our commercial position as are now being so effectively used to deprive us of that position by Genaany and Russia. is not suggested that subsidies should be y P* $ * granted for any long period; on the contrary it appears to he of prime importance that any subsidies granted should be given (a) for a very limited per iod; (b) in such a manner that the total value of the subsidy may be revocable at any time without giving the beneficiaries any cause of complaint upon the withdrawal of the subsidy. It is also natural to enquire what objects the proposed subsidies would be expected to fulfil to justify their grant. The first and most important object is to make sure of the present doubtful continuance of effect iveeffective British Steamship service to the Persian Gulf, and to safeguard our Companies against their being driven into such low water as to make them willing to sell their businesses to foreign hands. The second is scarcely less important and is to ensure the existence of reasonably low rates of freight to the Persian Gulf, upon which the whole volume and penetrative capacity of the British export trade depends. German exports start not only with the advantage of cheaper cost in production, but enjoy special low rates on their Home railways if destined for export. British goods enjoy no such advantages and may therefore be said to start to a certain extent handicapped in the commercial race* Doubly important therefore does it become that Brit ish goods should not be further penalised by exces sive rates of freight such as those which result from Ocean Combines, and Ocean Combines must inevit ably be the alternative if Government aid be with held. The third object is to secure a postal service toto many ports of the Persian Gulf, which already offer openings for commercial development, in which British political influence Is still supreme, and in which closer connection on our part with the natives who acknowledge our suzerainty and depend upon our support and protection, might he expected to achieve and perpetuate those objects for which England has consistently made sacrifices for more than two centuries. Such a policy as is herein advocated is ob viously open to many theoretical objections, but it is a policy of necessity, not dictated by British policy but by the policies of our trade competitors in the Persian Gulf markets, and it is to be hoped may only be found necessary for a limited period. There is, I suggest, every reason for this hope, in view of the present unsatisfactoiy condition of the Hamburg-American Company, who have not only had to reduce their dividend this year, but who have in curred heavy losses both in ships and in trade in the Persian Gulf. The result has been that the Hamburg-Hamburg-American Line has countermanded existing orders for Atlantic Liners, and has, in an unpre cedented manner, sought to make tenas with the British Shipping Companies. Rirther West the Deutsche Levante Linie, trading with Turkey and the Levant, show signs of considerable weakness, and declare in their last report a total loss of 2,800,000 marks. The present time, therefore, appears to be an exceptional opportunity to aim a blow at the systems of subventioned trade and transport which have done so much to injure British Commerce, and a most in auspicious time in which to see agreements concluded which may be sufficient to tide our competitors over their most difficult period. The evil effects of shipping Rings upon trade are too well known to need any further reiteration, and it may therefore suffice to point out that a material augmentation in the rates of freight to the Persian Gulf has already actually occurred since the conclusion of the agreement with the German line. In view ol these facts and the serious result^. both“both political and coonercial, which are only too likely to follow upon the present situation, I ven ture to express the hope that His Majesty*s Govern ment may realise the necessity of taking immediate steps to put an end to the present unsatisfactory condition of affairs and to safeguard the future of British mercantile communications in the Persian Gulf.

Different Customs directors, in 1904 and 1906 , asserted their paramount authority over the contractor, and their right to dismiss him, but for the last two years the Customs have dropped this argument, having seen the necessity of separating the functions of the contractor, and have taken up the position that the landing should properly be effected by the Companies, and that the latter are entitled to appoint any one they choose for the purpose. In 1903 an attempt was made by the agent of one of the Shipping Companies to form a combine among the agents of the four or five British Steam-ship Companies running to Bushire for the landing of cargo, with a capital of 5 , 000 /., but the proposal came to nothing. By 1904 so many complaints had arisen between the steamer agents and the Customs as to the landing of cargo that the former all addressed their several principals, the Shipping Companies recommending the formation by them of a Lighterage Company. In this connection the agents of the British India Steam Navigation Company and the Bucknall Steam-ship Lines wrote to the Consulate on the 19 th September, 1904 :— “ The whole matter has been referred home to the principals of the firms concerned, and we are unable to say at present whether they intend to endeavour to form a Landing or a Landing'and Delivery Company.” In 1905 the question of “ hamalage,” or landing, again became acute, and the united European houses drew up a one-year contract and a tariff with an Armenian, the rates being considerably raised to pronde for the better payment of the boatmen. But all along the hamal-bashis have been men of straw. Under the old Customs regime the Governors used to farm the contractorship out to Mahommedans for exorbitant sums, and the wholesale robbery and disappearance of goods from and in transit to the Customs was the consequent result. The Armenian contractor who followed was, perhaps, more honest, but possessed no means to carry on a work requiring considerable initial capital, and still less any power to control the impudent and unruly boatmen. Both before and after the expiry of his contract fresh disturbances arose, the boatmen refusing on several occasions to proceed to sea unless high rates were guaranteed or outstanding arrears paid up; this meant that the steam-ship agents were frequently compelled to pay the boatmen in advance, and led ultimately to another raising of the landing tariff at the end of the summer of 1907 . Heavy debts caused the dismissal of the Armenian contractor, and more recently a Mahommedan, upon whom his mantle descended, has been found to be implicated in several disappearances and thefts of merchandize from the Customs’ premises. The present state of affairs and the untrustworthiness of the merchants’ nominees has occasioned great annoyance, but it is most unlikely to find a remedy except in a radical change of method and management. There is no native of Bushire who has the capital to undertake the work and run it effectively, and at the same time on honest lines; the requirements of the Shipping Companies, the grasping and dictatorial attitude of the boatmen, and the difficulty in recovering landing charges from native traders render the post trying as hitherto constituted, if not distinctly unremunerative. Throughout this controversy the British Steamer Companies have persistently refused to interest themselves, and, in reply to the advice of their agents here, have held that the landing business did not concern them, and that if it were a profitable invest ment the agents themselves should undertake it. This, however, was an impossible step to expect from the agents, who might at any moment be deprived of their agencies, and the course suggested is open to many objections on other grounds. The question ot the Lighterage Company was last urged on the Shipping Companies by their agents in October 1906 and August 1907 , when, on the refusal of lightermen to go Oa to the steam-ship Tabaristan,” the agents of the Anglo-Algerian Line finally notified their principals:— It } ou do not accept our proposals, please do not bother yourselves in future bv asking us why this or that steamer was detained.” To &gt;uch a point had the hectoring attitude of the lightermen reached that on that occasion the ^ ice-Consul was appealed to by the captain of the ship, and compelled to go in person to the quay-side and ask the boatmen as a personal favour to proceed to sea, and thus save the steamer costlv demurrage. I he continued refusal of the Shipping Companies to intervene was in itself a matterfor considerable regret. A new factor has, however, altered the whole situation since 1907, and makes their further non-intervention in the lighterage question a danger not only to themselves, but also to English trade as a whole. I refer to the activity of the German Shipping Company, and its zeal for all kinds of doubtfully remunerative enterprise, supported by a State subsidy, as it undoubtedly is, in the hope of finding and utilizing weak spots in the present British trade stronghold. The existence of Messrs. Wonckhaus’ ill-will towards the hamal-bashi regime, accentuated as it was by the fact that it was managed by British firms and under British official influence, has already been noted elsewhere. The first move in what may well seem a directly threatening movement towards British commerce was taken the other day, when the agents of the Hamburg-Amerika Line notified the Director of Customs that in future they would have no dealings with the hamal-bashi, but would land their own cargo and put it in the custom-house themselves. There was no rule to force them to work through the landing contractor, and no valid objection could be raised. To my mind, hoAvever, this may prove an opening and a starting-point for a wide-spread attack on the British carrying trade—to England, at any rate. It would be only necessary for the Germans to bring out a small steam-lighter and have two or three native craft for them to offer to put cargo on board their own steamers and discharge it for a nominal sum (or even free for a short time), just in order to win the hearts of fickle Persian traders, and thus gradually attract to German vessels the custom now enjoyed by ourselves. As stated by Mr. G. A. Lloyd in his recent Report, it is already a significant fact that Manchester goods are brought out in German steamers. It would be easy, once a regular carrying business and clientele is established, to induce importers by low prices to try German cottons and prints instead of English ones. It is to be doubted whether the British Shipping Companies have in their previous refusals to combine to effect the lighterage ever contemplated this turn of affairs. More than once before the Anglo-Algerian Company have made costly mistakes in not taking heed of warnings as to competition, and the presence of the opposition steamers of Andrew Weir and Co. in the Gulf is a recent instance of the result. I consider it imperative, under present conditions, that there should be no break in the conveyance of cargo from British steamers to the Persian shore in British lighters ; it is obvious that a German-managed connecting link between the British ship and Persian trader might become a most inconvenient factor, which every effort should be made to get rid of. The difficulty in the past has always been to make the Shipping Companies them selves take interest in the project, Avhich has been strongly and repeatedly urged upon them by their agents and the captains of their vessels, and it will probably need considerable direct pressure by Government to induce them to abandon their uncom promising attitude. I Avill now endeavour to reply to the questions asked in your despatch under reply. Resources necessary for the Inauguration of a Lighterage Company. Under the former contract the Armenian landing contractor was bound to subsidize twelve native sailing lighters, each capable of holding some 200 bags of sugar, a stipu lation never kept to. Consensus of opinion seems to indicate that the purchase of some six to eight lighters, at an aggregate cost of 600/. to 800/. approximately, and if possible the provision of a small steam-tug or steam-lighter of sufficiently light draught to come into the shallow harbour should be the primary outlay, exclusive of the wages of boatmen, the salary of a superintendent and native tally-clerks. In 1906 the hamal-bashi’s receipts for landing and manipulation of cargo for ten months were handed in as 149,263 krans (approximately 2,714/.), and his expenses for boat hire alone for the same period were 30,618 krans (approximately 5o7/.). The hamal-bashi could not make the undertaking pay, but his losses were chiefly incurred in the Avork of manipulation and porterage, which would lie outside the piovince of any institution for lighterage purposes alone. • With the principal Shipping Companies interested in the Lighterage Company, it should not be difficult to arrange a system by which delivery orders on the Customs Avould only be issued to the consignees after payment of the landing charges, a procedure Avhich had to be adopted once before when a strike of the hamal-bashi s [2952 /—3] B 24 boatmen forced the steamer agents to hire boats themselves at the arbitrary rates of their owners, and which tends to do away with one of the chief causes of past inefficacy, i.e., indefinite delay by the native merchants in paying charges due to the contractor for work already done. The responsibility of a Lighterage Company would cease with delivery into the charge of the Customs, and it would remain for the consignees to arrange separately the delivery of their goods at their godowns. Attitude of Local Authorities. The local Persian authorities would have no call to interfere with the institution of a Lighterage Company. As far as we know, there is no indication of the Governor of Kalantar directly benefiting by the present system. Attitude of Local Merchants. The principal consideration with native merchants is cheapness, and, provided a British Lighterage Company did not deliver goods at dearer rates, or with more careless ness than at present, no objections could be raised. This would be especially so were the present Shipping Companies to combine to form a nucleus of capital and boats for lighterage. In fact, some of the Armenian community have been trying in the last month to promote a lighterage scheme to be run with native capital, but the unwilling ness of Persians to hazard any deposits of money, discord betw een the various native merchants and the financially crippled condition of Bushire are obstacles to the scheme coming to any good head. Moreover, it is problematic whether, on account of the notorious unscrupulousness and dishonesty attending native concerns, the Shipping Companies and agents would, or should ever, consent to land their cargo through such connections, and in any case it is certain, without the co-operation of the shipping agents, no Lighterage Company could pay its way. It might be advisable for the Shipping Companies participating in the Lighterage Company to secure the good-will—even to the extent of co-operation—of the two Persian agents of Messrs. Andrew eir and Co. and the Bombav-Persian line. Attitude of Local Customs. The local Director of Customs does not now claim to interfere with the landing of cargo ; indeed, he has for some time past maintained that the Shipping Company should Jana their own cargoes, and believes such an arrangement to be the true solution of the constant difficulties with the native hamal-bashis. Reasons for pressing for Change in present System. The general outline of the present chaotic state of the landing question have already been stated. The tariff is only so far fixed, as the boatmen are content to work at the present lates; there is no power and no contract now binding them to insure their obedience to instructions. In 1906 the tariff rates were raised 20 per cent, in the summer of 190 &lt; they were raised further. The eontractorship has gone from bad to worse, and at the present the shipping agents are perplexed to know what to do. The Persian Government has largely itself to blame for this state of affairs, and as it has never interfered to amehorale the situation, it can lay no shadow of a claim to put oiward objections to a purely trading establishment in no wav trespassin«- on its sovereign rights. - i » Likelihood of British Shipping Combine undertaking Work. It has already been seen that the Shipping Companies have been deaf in the past n ‘ eir a . gentS i , But * is P roba ble that, if they were specifically approached by Government, and the gravity of future possibilities and the present situation pointed out to them, they could be led or driven into taking action in the direction desired The Government of India might be prepared to bring influence and pressure to bear on the British India Steam Navigation Company to obtain theirThe Companies chiefly concerned are:— The Anglo-Algerian Steam-ship Company (Messrs. Strict and Co.), which mieht provide three lighters. The British India Steam Navigation Company (another three boats or more) The Bucknall bteam-ship Lines (one boat). There is little likelihood that the West Hartlepool Steam Navigation Company would contribute owing to the paucity of their sailings. It is for the Companies above named to decide whether they would ask the Bombay-Persian Steam Navigation Company to join them. ' &amp; ” 1 Entry of some outside British Firm. As s tat ed above, it ^ is eminently necessary that the lighterage service should be connected with the Shipping Companies, and until every means of inducement has failed it would be wise not to bring an alien British concern on to the scene. Government Guarantee. A guaranteed inteiest on the capital would certainly smooth the way for the Companies to undeitake the foimation of a Landing Company. Opinions are not unanimous as to the prospects of such a Company, some of the shipping agents holding that there would be at least a working profit on the yearly outlay ; another that there would be practically no profits, possibly a slight deficit. There is, in fact, so much difference of opinion, and the information on which to base anything like a reliable estimate, whether of profit or possible loss, is so inconclusive, that I am having statistics worked out showing the tonnage, the number of packages of each separate article of import landed during the year, the cost of landing calculated on the hamal-bashi’s present promiscuous tariff, and a scale per ton which would on the whole leave the average cost of landing consignments about the same as now. Until we get this, it is impossible to form a definite opinion as to what a guarantee on the part of the Government of India, either against loss or to insure a reasonable percentage to a Lighterage Company on their outlay, would involve. The completion of such statistics will take some little time, and I do not think it advisable that this communication should wait for them. I shall probably be able to telegraph the general result, if necessary, simultaneously with the arrival of the present post at Tehran. I have the honour, in conclusion, to append a copy of a letter recently addressed to me on the subject under report by the principal local agents for British lines plyino’ to the Gulf, and you will observe the views expressed therein generally bear out my statements. I am forwarding a copy of the correspondence to the Government of India. I have, &amp;e. (Signed) P. Z.

Letter addressed by British Shipping Agents at Bushire to Vice-Consul Chick. Bir, Bushire, March 10, 1908. IN reply to your inquiry as to the present influence of the hamal-bashi question on the lighterage on steamers at this port, we have the honour to give it as our opinion that the actual condition of affairs is detrimental in the extreme to our interests, besides causing us from time to time infinite trouble and annoyance, which ought not to be thrown upon ourselves as shipping agents, in inducing the boatmen to go out at all, and to forgo their constantly increasing demands for extra remuneration. There is no landing contractor honest enough for the post. We have in the past represented to our head offices that it would be in their own interests to combine to effect the landing of cargoes, and whether such business might be a profitable concern or net, we can only consider the possibilities of the German linetaking advantage of the present difficulties as very likely indeed. This would be no light matter to the interests of our principals. At present far too much of our time is wasted, without any remuneration to ourselves, with the troubles between the hamal- bashi and the boatmen, and the proper landing of cargo, and in disputes regarding packages which are alleged to have never been landed. This further tends to involve us in difficulties with native merchants, which is very undesirable. We have, &amp;c. (Signed) GRAY, PAUL, axd Co. A. and T. J. MALCOLM.Minute Paper.

Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey —(Received January 20, 1908.) (No. 21. Commercial.) Sir, _ . Tehran, December 31, 1907. I HAVE recently received copy of a despatch No. 7, Commercial of the 25th November last, addressed to you by His Majesty’s Consul-General at’ Bushire, forwarding a most able and carefully compiled Report by Mr. Chick on the operations of the Hamburg-Amerika Line in the Persian Gulf. I venture to draw your especial attention to the following of the tabulated con clusions at the end of Mr. Chick’s Report:— (1.) Reform in the local working of the Imperial Bank of Persia. I propose to take an early opportunity of bringing to the notice of the Chief Manager of the bank in Tehran the considerations set forth in the body of the Report, with a view to ascertain whether, in Mr. Rabino’s opinion, the bank would be able and willing to take any steps of the nature suggested. The matter seems to me one of considerable importance, more especially in view of German activity in southern Persia, and their evident determination to obtain a commercial and financial footing in this country, and I venture to suggest the advisability of approaching the Board of Directors in London on the subject, pointing- out to them the prejudice likely to result to their interests from the establishment of a rival banking establishment at Bushire—a contingency which must be reckoned with as a practical factor since the granting of a Concession for a German Bank by the Persian Government. (2.) Lighterage from British steamers in British-owned lighters. The danger of a lighter service being inaugurated by other than British enterprise, appears to me both real and grave. The Shipping Companies forming the British combine are no doubt aware of the desirability of instituting such a service, but it might not perhaps be amiss to draw' their attention to the danger of foreign competi tion in this respect. Moreover, it would appear that such a service w^ould be remunerative to its initiators, and, even if the British Shipping Companies are unwilling themselves to undertake it, other British firms might be attracted were the Board of Trade to give the necessary publicity to the requirements of the case. The knowledge- of the prosecution of the project in question would enjoy the support of His Majesty’s Government and of this Legation could hardly fail, did such a course commend itself to you, Sir, to serve as a substantial inducement. It might also be pointed out with advantage that an undertaking of this nature would, from its geographical position and from the fact that none of its operations would be conducted on land, be far less susceptible to the aggravating interference of the Persian authorities, by which the development of other foreign enterprises in this country has been so frequently hampered, and sometimes arrested. (3.) Greater regularity in the sailings of British vessels from Persian waters. A warning, it seems might usefully be conveyed in this connection to the manage ment of the Shipping Companies concerned ; for there is no apparent reason why British shipowners should be unable to give notice, at all events approximate, of their sailings, if foreign Companies are in a position to do so. (5) and (7) are subjects with which the Board of Trade would appear specially competent to deal, and I trust that their special attention may be invited to the points raised. (4) is a question which might involve the acquisition of a Concession from the Persian Government—a proposal which, in existing circumstances, and for reasons which it is unnecessary for me to recapitulate here, could not be entertained with any prospect on arriving at a satisfactory result. [2794 m— 19 ] [BJ PERSIA CONFIDENTIAL.(6.) This subject always occupies the vigilant attention of the Legation, and I shall not fail to furnish the earliest possible information of any German Concession scheme which may come to my knowledge. (8.) Confidential .—I understand from Major Knox that your Department has been kept informed of his efforts to arrange for direct shipments of Mauritius sugar from that island to the Persian Gulf. The desirability of securing a share for British merchants in this important branch of trade, now almost exclusively in non-British hands, is unquestionable, and I venture to hope that every legitimate encouragement ^ will be afforded by His Majesty’s Government in order to assure the success of the Uj experiment. I would, in conclusion, draw your attention to Mr. Chick’s remarks concerning the sample-room at the Bushire Consulate-General—an institution which, if fully taken advantage of, must prove of the greatest utility in familiarizing native merchants with British products and manufactures, and also in enabling British firms to gauge, with the minimum of risk and trouble, the nature and extent of the requirements of the local market. Were wider publicity among British firms to be given by the Board of Trade to its existence, its utility would undoubtedly be increased, with the most beneficial results to all parties concerned.

J Sir E Grey does not propose at present to take any action on Mr. Chick’s Report, except as regards the urgent question of providing an efficient lighterage service at Bushire (see p. 11 of Mr. Chick’s Report). You will notice that Mr. Marling considers the danger of the establishment of a foreign service to be both real and grave, and it is no doubt extremely desirable for British interests in the Gulf that this should be prevented. Sir E. Grey would be glad, therefore, if the Board of Trade would bring the matter to the notice of the steam-ship Companies named below, who appear to be those chiefly concerned, and induce them to give it their earnest consideration. If, after so doing, they declare themselves not prepared to undertake the service, it will be necessary to consider whether some other British firm should not be approached. It is probable that a satisfactory solution of the question would bring with it greater regularity in the sailings of British vessels, a point on which Mr. Chick rightly lays stress.

(5056). cm LONDON, February 19th 1908. ’ Sir:- I have the honour to inform you that certain pri vate investigations which I have been making into the trend of German Political and Commercial activity in the Persian Gulf resulted last week in my acquiring some information of an interesting nature respecting an attempt on the part of the Hamburg American Line to force their way into the British Shipping Combine now operating in the Persian Gulf Trade. The matter appeared to me so important that I im mediately made active and careful enquiries from the leading member of the combine, by name Mr. Strick, as to the truth of this report and having satisfied myself that such negotiations were already on foot and nearing conclusion, it seemed imperative to take all possible steps to obtain a postponement of an arrangement which I felt sure, if concluded, would come as a startling and unwelcome piece of news to His Majesty’s Government. Mr The Right Honourable Sir E. Grey, Bart.,to Mr. Stride informed me that negotiations were on foot between members of the British Combine and Herr Ballin who was then in London, and that it was probable that at a meeting to be held on Friday last an agree ment would be come to assenting in principle to the admission of the Hamburg American Line into the British Combine. Mr. Strick informed me that he had not intended to notify His Majesty’s Government of the impending agree ment, but that I was at liberty to do so if I wished, and that as he was aware that such an agreement involv ed grave issues of policy in the Persian Gulf he would be glad to know whether its conclusion would have the approval of His Majesty’s Government. As regards the negotiations instituted by the Ham burg American Line with the British Companies, it ap pears that Herr Ballin came to the combine and after discussing the present position of affairs informed them of his wish to be taken into partnership with the Brit ish lines in the Persian Gulf trade. He stated that the Combine must be aware that the Hamburg American Line had made considerable losses in their attempts to engage inin this trade and that he personally was also aware that his competition had made it practically impossible for the British lines to do more than pay their way if as much. He did not wish to threaten hut was desirous that it should he clearly understood that the German line had come to stay and that for 'certain and special rea- -sons' that line would continue its attempts to capture the trade even in the face of further losses and that if, moreover, no understanding were come to between the Hamburg American and the British lines, the former would commence calling at British Harbours and carry the war into the ports of London, Liverpool and South Wales. I enquired from Mr. Stride v/hat he proposed doing, and he replied that he was less anxious to admit the Germans into their combine than were his colleagues, but that whilst he was perfectly prepared to carry on a rate war against fair competition he did not see how the British Lines could hope to fight successfully against the power of the German Government, who, as Herr Ballin had practically admitted, were at the back of the Hamburg American Line. I pointed out to Mr. Strick what the admission of aa German line into partnership in our trade in the Gulf meant, and warned him that any temporary arrangement for cooperation in trade in the Gulf with the Hamburg American Line could not mean any real conclusion of hostilities hut only an armed truce from which if a five years 1 agreement were concluded the Germans would only emerge stronger and in a better position to fight at the end of it than they were before. And further, since Herr Ballin’s overtures might be taken as a proof that the Hamburg American Line were seriously feeling the ef- -fect oi British competition, did not the present finan cial crisis in Germany make this a particularly inaus picious moment for the conclusion of an agreement which would relieve Germany of all the stress of competition? Mr. Strick replied that he naturally disliked tak ing a German line into partnership especially when it was considered that the Germans would thereby after only two years experience of the Persian Gulf trade be sharing in a commerce which it had taken British enter prise and money something like a century to create. He did not shut his eyes to the fact that such a partner shipI -I I replied that I was not In a position to check the accuracy of his remarks respecting the profits or losses of the Comhlne, whereupon Mr. Strick said that he would he only too pleased to show me for my personal and private Information the summaries of his voyage accounts, which would Irrefutably demon strate the truth of his statement. After several and protracted interviews with Mr. Strick during last week, I obtained a pledge from Mr. Strick that he would have no dealings with Herr Bal- lin for the moment, and that he would keep me in formed as to the progress of affairs between now and Herr Ballin's next visit to England. Mr. Strick kept his word, and instead of attend ing the meeting on Friday last informed his col leagues that he did not propose even to meet Herr Ballin, and that he did not wish to resume negotia tions for the moment. I venture to submit that although my interviews with Messrs. Strick have been successful in staving offis by no means solved and will recur in an acute form in the course of three or four weeks, and un- ' , - less we are content to watch complacently the anni hilation of our trade in central and southern Persia and Mesopotaiiila hy exactly the same methods which have in the northern districts of the same country proved so fatal to British trade, something drastic must he done to place British trade on terns of equal competition with our foreign trade. I venture to submit that it must be borne in mind that the markets served by the Persian Gulf lines, whilst capable of expansion, are to a certain extent limited markets. That is to say that the margin of wealth of its inhabitants is low and that full scope cannot be given to even the wealth that exists owing to the poor credit enjoyed by those countries. The demand being for cheap goods, once Germany is allowed to enjoy partnership in tne valuable goodwill of the British names, it is prob able that a very large proportion of the trade that will be carried by the German lines will be done at thethe expense of the British trade and not merely an augmentation of the total trade. The country of origin of the goods will change hands together with the nationality of the transport service. It majr not he common knowledge that the British India Companies annually lose considerable sums in their Persian Gulf service, and it is interesting in this connection to note Sir James Mackey*s reply to my query as to why, if that were the case, the Brit ish India Company, continued their service. The re ply was that the continuation of that service was Imperative in the larger interesos of the Company, inasmuch as its abandonment would open the way for a foreign Company to take up the Persian Gulf trade and create interests that would seriously affect the position of the Companj' in the Indian coasting trade. I venture to say that this is a truth that applies forcibly to the question of German participation in the British trade ventures in the Gulf. Once admit the Hamburg American line into the British Combine and it will never again be possible to point with such force as before to the predominance of British commercialcommercial interests In the Gulf, and the Interests that the Germans would he enabled to create by their share in the British asset of 'goodwill' must be the stepping stone to further interference in Indian trade and Indian communications. British trade in Mesopotamia and Central Persia is being crushed to-day between the mill stones of foreign subsidised competition, by Russia in the north, by Germany and Russia in the South. What the effect has been in the North is well known, and has been publicly announced in defence of the Anglo Russian treaty. What has happened in the North is in a fair way to happen in the South unless some thing is done to place British enterprise upon equal terms with their foreign rivals. It is doubtless disputable what may be the wisest way to assist in maintaining British communi cations in the Gulf; it is however, I venture to / submit, indisputable that it can no longer be the way of the past. New circumstances demand new methods. Where foreign competition existed not atall. subsidised foreign compel* lb Ion has now sprung up, and a point has been reached where the actual existence of important British interests is serious ly threatened. In view of what has taken place therefore, I venture to suggest that it is important to consider the situation before the resumption of negotiations with Herr Ballin which is likely to take place at the beginning of April.

I was informed confidentially that Herr Ballin of the Hamburg toerican Line was in London at the present time endeavouring to come to some arrange ment with the British combine, which would result in the inclusion of his company with the British com bine. Herr Ballin has explained to the British ship ping companies that there is not the slightest pros pect of his line relinquishing their interest in the Persian Gulf transport trade whatever the losses that line may incur in getting a share in the commerce&gt; and ijHat ne concluded that oh is would he more readily appreciated when he stated that his company was 'bound for certain and special reasons' to continue Sir E. Grey, Bart., M.P., &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. theirtheir efforts towards acquiring for German shipping an Interest inthePersian Gulf Trade. Herr Ballln reiterated the threat that the Ham burg American Line, if It could not come to a working arrangement with the British direct lines would ex tend its competitive area to Include British ports. My Informant stated that no decision had yet been taken by the British combine as to what answer should be given to Herr Ballin's representations, but that he was to see Herr Ballln again on the subject on Wednesday the 12th instant. j Meanwhile realising as he did that their decision affected to a considerable extent many Important ques tions of British policy in the Persian Gulf, he would be glad to know in what light His Majesty's Government would view the acquisition by such an important German line of a more permanent foothold and share in the Brit ish trade of the Persian Gulf. Theie is no doubt that there are a good many na tive and other merchants in Manchester who would be only too glad to see another line, German or otherwise. startstart in competition to the British lines from Eng lish ports, as being likely to effect a further re duction in rates, utterly irrespective of what the ultimate effect would he upon British comnercial and other Interests in the Persian Gulf, hut this is i largely the result of a certain bitterness of feel ing that has resulted from the high rates of freight Imposed In the past by the British lines, it seems unlikely however that the British lines will In the future be able to make a recurrence to the old rates, I venture to call serious attention to the im portance of the Issue as well as to the fact that once the largest German line In the world Is taken into partnership with British lines in the Persian Gulf, it lianediately places German interests In those regions on a different footing and makes it difficult to point to the predominance of British commercial interests with the same force as before. That a German line of steamers should be able, in two years by means of imperial subsidies and rate cutting, to force us to share with it all the advan-advantages which it has taken us a century to create; and large yearly expenditure to maintain, is suffi ciently regrettable, and it becomes I submit a ques tion of urgency to consider whether no dispositions can be taken by His Majesty's Government which would, without giving the British combine a position such as would result in exorbitant rates being charged, put the British lines in a better position to continue the fight against the German line.

We should be relieved to learn that nego tiations with Herr Ballin had not resulted in an agreement. It is not unlikely in view of the constant losseslosses of the Hamburg .America Line in their trade to the Persian Gulf, that this is the last endeavour on the part of the German Line to force British ship ping to admit them to an alliance before retiring if they fail in their attempt.

Sir, Bushire, November 25, 1907. I HAVE the honour to submit for your consideration a copy of a very interesting and exhaustive Report, drawn up by Mr. Vice-Consul Chick on the operations of the Hamburg-Amerika Line in these waters during the first year of their venture, and bearing of the latter on the prospects of British commerce. I venture to hope that, as far as is considered possible, the attention of Chambers of Commerce may be directed to the salient conclusions arrived at. The Report is very thorough in itself, and my views being generally in accord with Mr. Chick’s, I do not think advantage would be gained by my delaying submission of the papers in order to discuss at length the various problems dealt with by him. The main fact is that it seems to be clearly demonstrated that if British Shipping Companies and British traders can only be induced to arouse themselves and look to the weak spots in their armour, there is as yet no reason for us to be seriously apprehensive of the effect of the German competition lately inaugurated. It may rather prove a useful corrective and stimulant. In this connection I would draw special attention to the summary of salient desiderata given at the conclusion of the Report. In regard to the several items which the exertions of this Consulate-General can assist in promoting locally, all that is possible is being done, but items 1, 3, 4, and 6 especially I respectfully commend to the sympathetic consideration of His Majesty’s Government, which will, I hope, indorse the view that, having regard to the existing political outlook, the early capture of prominent commercial points of vantage is likely to assist us materially in combating the evident efforts of Germany to create vested interests on which she may ultimately base a claim to be associated with the political as well as the commercial future of Southern Persia and the Gulf. I take the opportunity afforded me by the submission of the present Report to testify my thorough appreciation of the ability and great industiy which Mr. Chick, who has now held the post of Vice-Consul for a complete year, brings to bear upon all his work. I could not wish for a more satisfactory Lieutenant, and feel sure that British commercial interests in this neighbourhood could not be in better hands. I am forwarding a copy of the Report simultaneously to the Government of India and His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Tehran. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) P. Z. COX, Major. In closure 1 in No. 1 . Report on German Trade and the Hamburg-Amerika Line in the Persian Gulf, 1906-1907. (Confidential.) THE entry of the LLamburg-Amerika Line into the trade of the Persian Gulf in August 1906 came in nowise as a surprise, for already in 1896 Lord Salisbury had alluded in a despatch to Her Majesty’s Minister in Tehran to an announcement that “a direct line under the German flag between Hamburg and Bushire is in con templation. ’ ’ A full year having expired since the service was initiated, statistics are now appended to show the trend and effect of the operations of the German Steamship Company, more especially as far as regards Bushire and the nether waters of the Gulf. Statistics alone, however, hardly express the spirit of competition engendered by the visits of the Hamburg-Amerika steamers, for the fact that the German firm of Robert [2757 x — 2 ] BWonckhaus and Co. were given the agency of the steamship line, and have to a certain extent been able to make the steamers specially foster their own commercial develop ment, coupled with the keen interest taken for the success of the scheme by the German Government and financial institutions, has naturally aroused an antagonistic spirit among the important British commercial concerns in the Gulf ports. If anything, the attitude of Russian officials and the Russian Odessa Company has been one of even greater suspicion towards the German venture than has that of our own nationalists. The ultimate aim and orientation of the new undertaking in its politico-commercial sense, though earnestly sought for, has proved very difficult of ascertainment; and this very uncertainty has kept the European mercantile communities in a state of somewhat nervous anticipation. Overtures by the Deutsche-Orient Bank of Hamburg to native British traders in Bunder Abbas, ostentatious forward policy in Lingah, including, it appears, the flying of the German flag over two native boats, the endeavour 'to inaugurate relations with the Arab coast, as well as financial operations in Bushire, and many rumours of other forms of enterprise have added to the perplexity with which the future of German identification with the politics and commerce of Persia ia generally regarded. German institutions in Southern Persia and the Gulf consisted, in August 1906, when the Hamburg-Amerika Line commenced its sailings, of Heinicke and Co., in Shiraz, managed by Mr. Heinicke, erstwhile captain of the Persian gunboat “ Persepolis,” now a merchant exporting vegetal produce, chiefly gum, gum tragacanth, and raisins, and of Messrs. R. Wonckhaus and Co. The latter firm has extended its operations considerably in the past few years, enabled, no doubt, to do so through the financial support afforded by the dormant partners, Messrs. Traun, Sttircken and Co., of Hamburg, a member of whose firm toured the Gulf a year or so ago. Mr. Robert Wonckhaus first appeared in the Gulf as the employe of Messrs. Prins, otiiicken and Co., v r ho, not knowing whether the venture would prove successful, preferred not to involve their own name in the speculation, which, however, at the moment was lucrative enough. Business was first started at Lingah in or about 1896 entnely for the shell trade. In 1899 Mr. Wonckhaus opened out in Bahrein with a erman employe British firms having previously been represented in the islands by native agents. _ In 1904 Mr. Wonckhaus was induced to extend his operations to ifushire, and it is certain that at first his principals, still unable to decide whether the business should or should not be conducted in their own name, saw reason to regret the move. Knowledge of the intentions of the Hamburg-Amerika Line, however, changed ne aspect ot affairs for them, and further expansion to Mohammerah, Bussorah, and Bunder Abbas m 1904 and following years resulted. Ihe firm is at present represented in Bahrein and the Persian ports by— Herr Bahnsen, at Bahrein. Herr Brown, at Lingah. Herr Roever, ,, Herr Krumpeter, at Bushire. Haji Mushir-ut-Tujjar, at Mohammerah. Agha Ghulam Ali Ivhorassani, at Bunder Abbas. Freights. Ihefiist effect-a beneficial one of the incidence of German competition made nse elt m a rapid fall of freight rates to Europe. Previously the three British shipping lines forming the Conference, viz.: ( 1 ) The Anglo-Algerian Steam-ship mmpanj , ^ ) t e Bucknall Steam-ship Lines ; and (3) the West Hartlepool Steam Navigation Company had a fixed rate from Bushire to London of 30s. per 40 cubic feet, wit i a_ graduated scale for produce in bags or bulk. There were rumours before the arrival of the first German steamer that freights would be offered at 11 s., and London lates were reduced to a ^ 0 s. basis, but the initial German rate proved to be 18s. to 20s., soon ec ^ down at the last figure. There have been, however, substantial dmerences m the tonnage allotted to various produce by the Hamburg-Amerika as compared with the English steamers ; thus gum is reckoned per ton of 15 cwt. by the on erence, pei ton of 18 cwt. by the German line. The last-named line still shows lbt “. lct dpPosiBon to cut rates still finer by underquoting prices, in the hope of at ractmg the custom that does not come. With the prospect of a rate war, the Anglo- . Igeuan Line announced in the spring of 1907 its intention of making Hamburg a portLndonTndMLpW German Company has threatened to take cargo from regards exports^omTlip s °d ar as ^ known, falfilled its threat. But as proceed tn G f ’ Br A lt T h steamers . have standing orders, it is believed, to be booked. urg or ^ ntwer P provided a sufficient quantity of cargo can Service of Steamers. The monthly sailings were effected by the following steamers in the order given - Steam-ship “ Canadia.” Steam-ship “ Savoia,” 2,614 tons.

More than one of them has however, been stranded on the Bussorah bar ; the steam-ship “ Hungaria ” was reported aground four days m the Straits of Messina, was delayed on the bar in January by an escapade of her captain, who left his ship to go to the help of a dhow in distress the same captain was afterwards m command of the steam-ship “Teutonia,” which put into Port Sudan with her propeller broken, necessitating the charter of the British steamer Wmgrovc. Lastly on the homeward voyage the steam-ship “Teutonia” went ashore on Masoreh Island, m the dominions of the Sultan of Muscat, and seems likely to become a total wreck. Financial Aspects. These heavy losses alone must needs be written off against anv profits that may have accrued to the Company from freights. But it is highly improbable that any profit was made on any single sailing, and the master of one of the German vessels on e run vouchsafed the statement that each voyage resulted in a dead loss to the ompany of not less than 1,0001. Moreover, a scrutiny of the cargoes imported into the Gulf as given m the statistics hereto attached, goes far towards showing that the T P u 1 T dS y°' ld have 'f 1 , 1 , an y thm g kut. well-filled. An average of the cargo landed at ail the Gruit ports and Lussorah (exclusive of Bagdad through cargo) gives 14'016 packages per vessel per voyage, a much inferior quantity to that usually carried in British bottoms ; and further investigation shows that these packages are often light and small cargo, piece-goods and sugar being present in very small proportions A iurther factor, tending to indicate that the net result of the enterprise has been so far considerable loss whether to the Hamburg-Amerika Line or its agents—is the system adopted by the German steam-ship agents at .Bussorah and Mohammerah of tilling the ships with their own export cargo. I am assured by British merchants of ong experience m the Gulf that such a policy, save in exceptional times, has been proved before now to be the reverse of remunerative, if on steamer’s account and means certain losses to the agent in the contrary case. There is yet to be placed to the debit of the venture the facts that practically little cargo has been taken away from the Gulf ports other than Bussorah, Mohammerah, and Bagdad, that watchful competition by all the other Companies has reduced the German bookings of native cargo to a minimum, and lastly that, as exemplified in several cases in Bushire their agents are not always fitted by a knowledge of local conditions and of the race with wnom they deal, to make the necessary headway. • o* r ^^ ie ] P r °k a bl e sources of loss during the period under observation being thus indicated locally by circumstantial signs, the admission by the Company of its losses is worthy of mention. His Majesty’s Consul-General at Hamburg has in a confidential letter, written previous to the mishaps which attended the ill-fated steam-shin leutoma, mentioned that “according to their own statement of the HamburoG Amerika Line the steamer service which was started last year between Hamburo- and the Bersian Gulf ports (and other ports) was not attended by profits, but, on the contrarv was attended with considerable costs.” !t would be idle to conjecture the causes which have led the Hamburg-Amerika bteam-ship Company to undertake these costly sailings, and the probable limit to winch losses will be sustained without a modification of the present service A0 newsagent of the Consulate-General has, it is true, reported as a statement made by the German Consulate Munshi, that the steamship line is prepared to meet losses of 3 000 000 marks over a period of three years on expenditure incurred on the enterprise. ’ It is, however, stoutly maintained by the British steam-ship lines and the masters of vessels in the Gulf trade that the venture is financially supported by the German Government, despite repeated denials on the part of the latter. Notwithstanding the hope expressed by the Hamburg-Amerika Line that “ the out lay will in course of time prove to have been warranted by the beneficial results which will arise from the opening of this new steamer service for the general commercial and industrial interests of Germany,” prospects in the Persian portion of the Gulf seem to afford no special grounds for apprehending any marked impetus in the carrying trade of the Hamburg-Amerika vessels. The principal commodities in heavy demand in Persia are Manchester goods and sugar, both French and Belgian. The first are unlikely to be replaced in the popular estimation for a long period, and the contract for the freight of French sugar is at present held by an English steamer line, while the major part of the Belgian brand likewise falls to another English Company. As long as the British Companies maintain their present attitude towards any competitive movement, such as the cutting of rates by the German Company, and their option on the renewal of existing contracts, there would seem, in the absence of any German institutions set up or concessions obtained in the south-west of Persia, to be small probability of direct trade with the Persian ports warranting the continuance of visits on business grounds. Moreover it is expected that the statistics for the second year of the German Company’s visits will show a decrease, as the result of various measures by the British firms for the protection of their own trade against further encroachments. Though statistics for Bussorah of the import and export cargoes carried by the Hamburg-Amerika Line’s steamers have been obtained through the kindness of His Majesty’s Consul at Bussorah, those statistics do not cover the total period now under review, and the comparison between the trade with the various ports is therefore defective, and similarly as regards statistical information received from the political resident at Bagdad. So far as the comparison extends it is clear that the importations into Turkish territory are much in excess of those into the Persian ports, and the exports from Bushire cannot even be proportionately compared with the exports from Bussorah, which are, it is understood, very largely the shipments of the German agents. En resume, it would appear that the carrying trade of the Hamburg-Amerika steamers has lain even more with the Turkish ports than the normal predominance of Bussorah over Bushire would pre-suppose. Putting on one side times of abnormally advanced prices for grain in Europe, such as the present, the experience of steamer agents in Bussorah, who have bought cargo expressly to fill their own steamers, has been heavy loss. The maintenance of the existing costly and unprofitable service without a change from this unsound policy will go far towards showing whether the line is not in reality indemnified by its Government, or induced by the promise of further gain from the valley of the Euphrates and Tigris to persist in a doubtful speculation. Part I .—Imported Cargoes. Reference to Statistical Table No. 1 gives the exact numbers of packages landed at Muscat, Bahrein, Bunder Abbas, Lingah, Bushire, and Mohammerah. Ahwaz cargo is not given, as the imports are unimportant. In the majority of cases the ships’ manifests have been obtained from the local Customs for this information. In no case has it been communicated by the German agents. It has been thought desirable to assign values to the cargoes, but no figures for this purpose have been received from Muscat and Bahrein, and in the case of Bushire—probably of the other Persian ports also— the absence of supervision by the Persian Customs over the declarations made by local merchants in payment of duties renders it impossible to trace the declared value of the different items of cargoes. Calculations have been made, therefore, on the basis of the approximate values in the Bushire market, and except as regards piece-goods, which are rated far too high, probably the value of Bushire cargo is fairly accurate. Ports on Arab shore of Muskat Bahrein Gulf- Packages landed. 6,227 10,098 16,325Persian ports— Bunder Abbas Lingah Bushire Mohammerah Turkish ports— Bussorah (for seven months only is given as) Bagdad (for six months only is given as) 52,745 57,753 16 849 ]i Bowi is. jig-ini Bushire, The average cargo landed at Busliire was very small—only 900 packages per vessel. Owing to the extreme reticence of the German office it was not possible to obtain the exact valuation of the imported goods. The number of packages, chiefly o^oo’ ^ ^ a British steamer of the Conference Lines to Bushire averages o,000-9,000 packages, and the record cargo has exceeded 17,000 packages. It will not be out of place to hazard a forecast that the second year of the line’s sailings to the Gulf will not show an increase in cargo landed at Bushire. The first the second y ear have landed 934 packages in all—445 from Hamburg and 445 from Antwerp, making an average of 311 per vessel, or less than one-third the amount recorded for 1906-7. 404 packages of the Antwerp cargo brought in a treight ol^ oil. 15s. 5d., so the calls at Bushire cannot be highly remunerative. m n •Tonf '^ 6 remembered that the statistics of the Persian Customs for the year March 1906-7, though notoriously unreliable in their assignment of import to the respective countries of origin, showed that Germany’s import trade to Bushire had decreased from 26,264/. to 25,459/., of wdiich some 10,000/. was pnmd facie Belgian sugar, Swedish matches, and Dutch candles. The current year, of which only five months’ figures are yet to hand, shows that Germany s imports to Persia via Bushire have decreased still further from 11,686/. to 7,910/. as compared with last year. This is the more remarkable as both the total value of import and that assigned to the United Kingdom are largely in excess of 1906—7.

It is further seen that Hamburg cargo is more nondescript than that from Antwerp ; it would thus appear that in the event of a rate war breaking out the British Steamship Companies would be justified in making Antwerp, rather than Hamburg, a port of call. Indigo .—By far the most important article imported by the Hamburg-Amerika Line was synthetic indigo from the Badische Soda-Anilin Fabrik at Ludwigshafen, 358 cases being imported by 8 different vessels. Each case weighs net 136 lb., either 3 4 or 5 tins going to the case. A tin inspected (of a case containing 4 tins) measured 20 by 12 by 8 inches, and weighted 34 lb. gross. The tins, packed five to a case, weigh 27 lb. each. This article has, in a few months, made a large inroad in a field hitherto held by India, natural dyes. In 1905 indigo, to the value of 21,164/. was brought into Bushire from India, chiefly Madras and Khairpur; in 1906-7 the value fell to 15,833/., the quantity to cwt. P444, and there appeared an item of 824/. [2757 x —2] 06 from Germany. In the six months of the year 1907-8, which ^come within the purview of the present report, over 300 cases of the latter product have been imported with a Customs’ value between 4,000h-5,000L, and a local value at destination in excess of 6,000L Enquiry at Isfahan, the greatest dyeing centre in Persia, showed that the price of synthetic indigo was about 110 krans (21. 4s. approximately) per Shah man of 13 lb. The Indian article varied, according to quality, from 100-200 krans (21. to. 4k 8 s.) for the same weight. It is thought by His Majesty’s Consul-General at Isfahan that the artificial is destined to supplant the natural dye, as the former has been a great success at Isfahan and Sultanabad. Bushire is remote from the dyeing centres but it would appear that a larger demand for indigo has existed during the current year, for the Customs’ returns here give the Import of Indian indigo for the first five months as 134T08 lb. with a value of 16,549k The market is very probably overstocked, and in any case Indian exporters of the better-class dye will need to reduce their prices considerably to compete against the German article; there is nothing at present to show that the Indian exporter has realised the threat to his trade and taken steps to meet it. The largest importer is a certain Essa Sarkis, of Isfahan, and Messrs. Ziegler and Company also use it at Sultanabad. Matches .—These are all Swedish by origin; the Vulcan Tandstickor “Globe” brand, manufactured at Tidaholm in Sweden, a sulphur match. They are packed in cases containing 50 gross, and in boxes of about 75 each, If inches in length, but their chief merit is the low price of 140 krans ( 2 k 15s. Qd.) per 50 gross. Transhipment is effected at Hamburg, and the agents are Messrs. Vogler and Trummer, of 6 , Lloyds’ Avenue, London. In an overstocked market, this brand of matches—classified as “ German ” by the local Customs’ Administration—has carried all before it. It cannot be too much emphasized that the sulphur match is predominant in Persia by reason of the inability of the great portion of the peasant class to pay for a safety match. The lack of enterprise on the part of British manufacturers to attempt competition with Swedish, as also the fact that all those matches classified by the Customs as “ English ” exports are Swedish made, has already been noted in the Trade Report for 1906-7. Sugar^ Loaf .—A Belgian brand from the Raffinerie Tirlemontoise, in cones about 11 inches in height, wrapped in blue paper with a round black label in the centre with gold lettering. The use of this brand of sugar is practically confined to the coast districts of the Persian Gulf, the article meeting with little favour up-country on account of less insolubility, and lack of sweetness as compared with French sugar. As a rule, it is packed in cases, more rarely in bags for transport inland. In the littoral it holds the market, principally on account of its shorter price, the cones only weighing P70 kilog., though the same size as 2 kilog. cones—thirty-six cones go to the case. This sugar is usually carried by the Anglo-Algerian Company’s vessels, and it would appear that no strict contract existed as in the case of the St. Louis sugar. In view of the vogue attained^ by Belgian loaf-sugar both in Turkish Arabia and the Gulf, to the building up of which trade the German Consul at Bagdad has made reference, it might be to the advantage of the Anglo-Algerian Steam-ship Company to secure an exclusive contract; the agents here lack information as to the existing arrangements made by the Societe de 1 Exportation des Sucres ” with the above-mentioned and Hamburg lines. The opportunity is taken to make an appeal for a trial of manufacture for the Persian market by English refiners ; Messrs. Tate &amp; Co. have, it is believed, informed one English shipper that they could not turn out loaf-sugar cones at a price that would pay them. I hough owing to the cheapness of sugar the moment may be unpropitious, yet it is possible that at the instance of the Board of Trade and Chambers of Commerce, the English manufacturer would be prevailed on to put English cones on the market beside the Belgian, Austrian, and French. Samples of these latter would gladly be sent with full details as to packing. Sugat, soft. Ihe lirst marks granulated brand from Hamburg: a dirty- coloured sugar, which is only appreciated in the coast districts, and then only when there is a scarcity of Austrian crystals. ^ n . conne ction attention might be called to the fact that 1,250 bags of Mauritius sugar, the first import for some years, sold well in Bushire a few months ago, and much more business might have been done with a larger stock on hand. C ane sugar has a great advantage over beet, on the ground of greater purity, in the eyes oi bluah religionists^ here. The medium-sized crystals were slightly yellow- tinged, but the chief desideratum is a low contract price between Mauritius and Bushire il possible.Drugs. Are almost entirely imports from Hamburg by the German chemist in lehran. the shippers are manifested as Blembel Gebriider, and Koch and Reiners. Candles. Shipments from Antwerp of stearine candles manufactured by Roubaix, Oedenhoven and Co. Priced at 36 krans per case of thirty packets. Window-glass. All Belgian manufactured, shipped by Lemmens. Coloured and white. The panes measure 12 inches by 10 inches ; coloured glass is very generally used in Bushire and Shiraz lor doors and windows. Cases contain sixty panes ; more rarely cases of thirty panes 24 inches by 20 inches. Price in Bushire 20 krans per case of white; 30 krans per case of coloured. Glassware. Chiefly from Antwerp ; also manufactured by the “ Compagnie des Cristalleries de Baccarat. None has been disposed of here, so no samples are available, all being indents from up-country, but the item comprises such articles as lamps, chandeliers, lustres, glasses, candlesticks, &amp;c. Cotton Goods. All the Antwerp shipments were either white cambrics of Messrs. G. Z. van Heek and Zonen or cotton drills from Van Heek and Co., both of Enschede. None are for the Bushire or Shiraz markets, the cambrics going to Isfahan and Tehran, the drills to Isfahan. It is not new trade, and there have been previous consignments in past years. The German agents have constantly sent to Germany samples of Manchester goods for imitation. In some cases, at least, the manufacturer has declined to imitate, the market not being sufficiently attractive. German prints that have been introduced show a lack of knowledge of requirements, widths, for example, being 20 inches, not 27—28 inches. The stuffs are better woven and of better design than the English, but both cloth and price are too good for the market. Sewing-machines .—German manufacture, consigned to Bushire by Eugene Rudenberg, offered here at about 21. per machine, but probably still unsold, as there is little opening in Bushire town. Kerosene .—Was exported from Fiume. Only 752 cases were landed at Bushire, and mostly forwarded to Shiraz, but over 10,000 at Lingah, chiefly for re-export to Debai, on the Arab coast. The tins bear no mark as to the flashlight standard of the oil. American oil has in the last two years driven Russian petroleum off the Bushire markets, but the latter reaches the Shiraz bazaars from the north. American oil can probably hold its own with the European import in price. Miscellaneous .—A considerable number of samples have been brought for the German agents, and more will be said on their method of advertising. It is noticeable that firms in England and India have been regrettably inattentive to the announcement of the circulation of samples made by the Bushire Consulate-General some months ago, which was intended to afford facilities and encouragement to British trade, but has met with little response. Bushire.—Exported Cargoes. The produce taken from Bushire by the line during the twelve months was comprised and distributed as follows — Packages. Declared Value. £ Hamburg 4,540 7,939 London 1,019 10,035 New York .. 51 504 Antwerp 1,658 5,080 Marseilles 206 303 . Turkish and other ports 1,940 2,962 * Total 9,414 26,823 The value of almost all the exported produce is taken from the declarations made to the Customs, the balance calculated at current rates; for the rest, export declara tions are to a degree unreliable. The greater bulk of these exports w r ere made in the first six months. The seeds were nearly all Messrs. R. Wonckhaus’ own cargo ; the raisins and gum consignments by the German Heinicke in Shiraz for Hamburg and New York; gum tragacanth to London. The opium to London was consigned by Persian merchants. Twenty-four chests of that shipped were lost in the ill-fated steam-ship “ Teutonia. It is thus apparent that little support was accorded to the line by the native trade.8 Exports from Bushire to Germany were, according to the Customs statistics in— £ 1905 .. .. .. .. .. 10,565 1906-7 .. .. .. 24,228 (of which 21,800/. gum). It is significant to note that for the five months of the current year, statistics of which are available, the direct exports to Germany have decreased from 5 219Z to 768 Z. ' ’ Patronage, however, is eagerly sought by the German agents, terms are made accommodating. Support might be obtained if the British lines are not watchful of ' their interests. Quite recently, during the opium boom, a serious blunder was made when rates were raised without warning from 27s. 6d. to 40s. per chest by the manage ment of the British lines in London. The German line immediately lowered its own to 20s., and the London Companies were forced to climb down. The faith of the Persian merchant in the British Companies has been shaken for he now believes it was the German line which kept rates down when the British were trying to put them up. If the British Companies forfeit the goodwill of the native merchant, and the latter is shrewdly quick at playing off one competitor against another, a decided impetus would be given to the German position at Bushire. The experiments made by the firm of Wonckhaus and Company in shipping linseed, poppyseed, and other seeds to Europe is the more remarkable as the British firms and agencies in Bushire and Shiraz practically ignore the export of such produce. It is opined that the time has come for these exports to be pushed, and for British houses to institute a demand. The present scanty supply locally is largely the result of an absence of demand by prominent houses in Bushire. Castor-seeds can be obtained to the amount of, perhaps, 50 cwt. on the island of Bushire, and more in the neighbouring districts of Tangistan to a distance of some 25 miles, but a demand for even that quantity would at once induce cultivation. Linseed, poppyseed, lucern, gingelly, or sesame, are growing around Kazerun, on the main route 120 miles from Bushire; Behbehan, some 50 miles from the coast at Bunder Dilum and Shiraz, 180 miles from Bushire. The chief necessity for the fostering of exports to the United Kingdom lies in the lack of quick and speedy transport from the Ears centres of cultivation to Bushire. The attention of the British Government might profitably, now the Russian Agreement has been arrived at, be directed to the promotion by English capital of the improvement of transport. Slight deviations from the present route might even permit, to a certain extent, of wheeled traffic. The proper surveillance of the 200 miles by any Transport Company would conduce, it is believed, m a large degree to the greater security of merchandize on the roads. Ihe inherent lack of initiative by Persian merchants of the south, and mistrust of each other and their own Government, most emphatically debar foreign trade from waiting for the remedy to come from the native. There would seem to be no prospect of an improvement of existing caravan routes emanating from any third source save British or other foreign capital. The German Legation had already in 1906 directed its attention to the fact that no Concessions were held on the southern road ; the existence of a Transport Company, whether involving or not a Concession, would imply important commercial influence. A reference to the comparative Table of Exports shows the relative importance to the Hamburg-Amerika Line of the sources from which cargo was taken m 1906 - 7. Part II. — Ports other than Bushire. Muscat. The imports into Muscat are only remarkable for the 2,071 cases of arms and ammunition. Cases of arms average fifty pieces per case, and, as the ammunition is not estimated for but only rifles, the valuation may be somewhat excessive. The type of weapon imported is believed to be Mannlicher, which has lately begun to make its appearance in the Bushire district, for a large portion of the cargo has presumably been brought over to the Persian coast, where the traffic in arms has greatly increased of late, being carried on with impunity in the very neighbourhood of Bushire In this connection it is interesting to note that the Munshi of the German Consulate in Bushire is interested in the arms traffic, and has an agent at Muscat. • No information is to hand to show the nature or texture of the bales of piece-goods imported or their popularity vis-d-vis Manchester goods.

Gray Paul and Co. m Bahrein, on account of an Agreement made by the line to carry all their goods at a reduced freight of Is. per ton. ^ On the other hand, the German firm has only three regular clients, and most of the imported cargo has been brought on their own account • r 7 er rt l !‘Z~ T n e qU ,? nt i ty ported by Messrs.

Wonckhaus and Co. have imported a large quantity of late on their own account, but the quality of the Hamburg coffee is not liked so much as that from London, the former being artificially coloured. Two hundred and fifty bags have lately been advanced by the firm to masters of pearling boats on account of shehs to be supplied next year. Sugar. Nearly all the sugar imported belonged to the English firm. Pear/s.—Messrs. Wonckhaus intend, it is said, bringing out an expert in pearls next year, with a view to trading in them on their own account iSMs.—During the last year the Germans have purchased about the same quantity as the English firm, but have allowed their native agents 20 per cent, commission which it is doubtful if the price of shells can stand. inns! mitioi Hief 10168$ ofrf Bunder Abbas. But 5,247 packages were landed during the year, of which 2,270 have been sulphur matches, the orders for which have, it is believed, originated without exception from Messrs. Forbes, Forbes and Co. of Kurrachee. Only one vessel called on the return voyage, and His Majesty’s Consul remarked at the end of February that “ the German line has not at this port proved hitherto a formidable rival to British shippers.” He added that “ with the advent of the German ships, local merchants became the recipients of sundry letters from the Deutsche-Orient Bank, of Hamburg, offering their services and facilities in the matter of trade relations with Northern Europe,” but, so far as can be ascertained, these have had no other result except to create suspicion.’’ The trade of Bunder Abbas is largely in the hands of Hindu traders, who rely on Kurrachee and Bombay. There is no German agent of Messrs. R. Wonckhaus and Co. in Bunder Abbas. The value of imports from Germany to Bunder Abbas, as given in the Trade Reports, was:— In 1905 .. .. .. .. .. .. 14437 In 1906-7 .. .. .. .. .. .. 28,549 [2757 x —2 ] d f 14,137 28,549 D10 Lingah. Lingah trade has sunk rapidly since the Customs were taken over in 1902 by the Persian Department, and for inland trade there is practically no market beyond the small port itself. Lingah has lost its importance as a distributing centre for the coast of Oman, but the explanation of the large number of packages landed lies in the fact that the agency of Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co. has made use of Lingah as the port for discharge of cargo for transhipment to Debai, where trade is reported to be growing in volume. Debai import trade is almost entirely done wdth India, and it is probable that direct communication with Europe means lower prices in some articles. The imports represent orders obtained by the German agent of Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co., who is making considerable show and, according to reports, boasts of the headway German trade is making at Lingah. The firm has acquired the former Persian Customs premises, the best site on the quay, and has purchased two native craft to collect shells from the pearling-vessels. There is no doubt but that this unexpected development of German trade in Lingah is greatly due to supineness on the part of the Persian agent of Messrs. Gray, Paul and Co. The latter firm have so far recognized this that they propose to send a more energetic Anglo-Indian representative to Lingah shortly. It will be seen, as a sequel, whether the amount of sugar, macaroni, and coffee imported by the German agency has diminished or not next year. So far no attempt has been made by Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co. to establish a branch m Debai, where no European agent has yet resided. As regards exports, the trade in shells has been a monopoly for the German firm at Lingah. Ahwaz. u TT^k® n . um k? r °f P ac k a ges imported by the first seven vessels does not, as detailed by His Majesty s Consul at Mohammerah, exceed 600. Part III.— . There aie certain points in connection with a review of German trade in the Gulf, which seem to call for special observation. Perusal of the foregoing detailed information must render salient the fact that t e German fum of W(s.chhaJl^and_Cq. are utilizing the German line for the export of t eir own purchases of grain to Germany. It is doubtful both whether the pecuniary interests of the shipping line will be promoted by this restricted policy, and still more so whether the use made of the line by the native exporters is sufficient to benefit the commercial interests of Germany. ? j COntr n ary \ ^ wou ^ seem that the Shipping Company has been deliberately deputed, at considerable cost to itself, to afford facilities to a single German firm, to create an interest m fact. The establishment of a branch at Bussorah and the institution of the steamer service were to a degree chronological. There was, perhaps, an under- s ai + 1 , ( in § t . ^ rm m question should, on its part, maintain and expend its agencies on ; e Persian shore, two of which cannot under existing conditions pay their way. ® comparatively modest figure cut by the German line in Persia should not lull the British Companies to any undue sense of security. The latter are already at a disadvantage m two points. u ^ irregularity of sailing's needs alteration. Exporters at Bushire wishing to ma m, or examp e, eptember, October or November shipments can never be sure of an mghsh vessel being available, and the mere uncertainty has, to our knowledge, before now thrown cargo into the arms of the German office. The English Companies despite official representations made to Government—have not yet recognized the P 1 ^ ° ^f 11 i ng ^ notices ; it is a considerable impediment for exporters in i ll ® 1 ^ re 110 h ow 0 re last moment by what ship and on what date their cargo will e a en. is ignorance of the movements of the British vessels applies not only to traders, but to the very ships agents.

St 1 eam - shl P A geicy. The native agent of the 1 at Bussoiah refused however, to allow space for this cargo to Bushire and succeeded m carrying his point, thereby disappointing the Russian agents and rendering the cargo liable to capture by the German line. g 1 ,r y®t another shipping question for which the attention of Government is asked and action of the British Companies urgently needed, in the landing of cargo at Bushire. If the Trade Reports of Bushire for some y^ars past be referred to constant complaints at the unsatisfactory state of the “Hammal Bashi,” or landing contractor s arrangements will be noticed. Under the system hitherto existent a nativf Persian or Armenian has contracted with the principal merchants to effect the landing o merchandize at fixed rates, the contractor binding himself to hire a certain numbef of fighters for the purpose The work must be prompt to satisfy the exigencies of the Indian mail-boats and London steamers; must often be done in boisterous weather, and with an inner anchorage 3 miles and an outer 9 miles from the quay. The working of the system has lately become most unsatisfactory and more than once broken down, to the extreme detriment of trade, for the over-carriage of cargo to Bussorah results m the ultimate return of cargo in a usually damaged state. The causes for this failure are several, but chief amongst them is the inability of the contractor to provide the necessary number of lighters and the growing insolence and independence of the boatmen owning and working the same, who will at times refuse to put olf or to accept the Tariff rates. Phis spirit is, in the opinion of residents of the town, becoming more nefarious each year. It is directly due to the fact that, whereas formerly the Glovernors farmed the Customs and had an interest in suppressing any friction with commerce, nowadays they are so far opposed to the Administration as to be the chiefest abettors of smuggling on the coast, and whereas formerly the bastinado was freely applied and imprisonment inflicted on malcontents, now intrigue and the scourge of informers to whom the Assembly in Tehran ^ sometimes too easily gives ear, and the fear of the misrepresentation of acts of public order as acts of oppression have effectually paralyzed any influence to check the boatmen. ^ ere i s one most patent reform necessary in the interests of British shipping and British trade the Companies should jointly make a small outlay of 1,000/. to 2,000/. on the purchase of lighters. This has been again and again urged by agents of the lines, but the Companies have not seen fit to consider the matter. It is now, in support of the Shipping Companies own interests, most strongly urged that the acquisition of some six or eight lighters, involving an expenditure of perhaps 100/. each, and, if possible, a small tug is eminently desirable. Not only will the difficulty as regards hired boats be overcome, but another danger avoided. The German agents have felt the hampering influence of the present makeshift, and have openly spoken of instituting a lighter service as a commercial scheme of their own at Bushire, and their active promotion of German interests in the Gulf makes the forthcoming of the necessary outlay highly probable. The establishment of a German lighter service at Bushire opens up a vista of disastrous consequences to the British Companies, and the latter must be first in the field. There are for the rest no indications that the outlay would not be amply covered by receipts. Quite apart from German shipping and import trade, there exist considerations even more weighty in the guise of German institutions in the south of Persia. The attitude of their pioneers now trading in the Gulf may be characterized as a tenacious intention to create interests, even at a pecuniary loss. Their Consul at Bushire is announced to return from Tehran by the Karun route, professedly with a mandate to study the possibilities of irrigation. It may well be apprehended that the report issuing to his Legation will be of such a nature as to induce in Tehran a powerful German intrigue for the granting of concessions, which, in view of the British schemes already mooted, could only be regarded as distinctly unpalatable to British interests in that region.An equally imminent question is centred in the unsatisfactory and baleful inflnpn^ of the Imperial Bank of Persia at Bushire over local finance. ^ ^ ast few years there has been a general complaint against the local branch of the Bank from both European and Persian merchants. It may safely be said thaf trade in Bushire works with the Bank against its will. It has been stated that there is no room for s third bank (the German) in Tehran and it may be that the Imperial Bank of Persia is sure of its own commandino- nositinn’ It would be incorrect to say the same of its branch in Bushire. There is possibly no other town in Persia where it would be easier for the German Bank to obtain a surer footing, and such is the feeling in the town against the methods of business of the British Bank that another banking institution, foreign or not would be welcome. The causes are manifold. Primarily the management in London is at fault for a policy and rules drawn un Persia 7 unacquamted with tde requirements of modern commercial competition in The agency allotment at Bushire is quite inadequate for the amount of business passing through and transacted in the place : the agency itself is subordinate to that m bhiraz, an up-country town with an entirely distinct commercial atmosphere and unable to act independently. Sir George Mackenzie is said to have recognized the desirability of freeing Bushire from the trammels of Shiraz and allowing the former ranch to extend its operations to Bahrein : desirability has with time become a need r „ 1 T q dl d &gt;U ; ty i 11 P ro ? ur mg cover 18 recognized by all, but no adequate reason has been adduced to show the necessity for the Bank to refuse Shiraz paper sometimes or periods of several weeks.

Sir:- I have the honour to transmit herewith, with re ference to your Despatch No.9 Commercial (50521) of September 21st last, copy of a Memorandum prepared by Mr. Loraine on the subject of German shipping competl tion in the Persian Gulf.

The competition of the German Line in the Persian Gulf has so far, I believe, been distinctly healthy, if regarded from the point of view of the general inter ests of trade as opposed to the particular interests of individual Shipping Companies. The three British Steamship Companies operating in the Persian Gulf had formed a sort of combine which enabled them to maintain their rates of freight at whatever figure they pleased, the monopoly they until recently enjoyed giving them complete control. The result was that they attained considerable unpopularity and, on the advent of the Germans, there were - certainly in Basra and probably in other ports in the Gulf - plenty of firms who were only too ready to give the new-comers a trial. As reported by Sir William Ward, even the fear of outside competition. particularly in view of the reputation for commercial efficiency possessed by their rivals, brought about an immediateimmediate and sensible reduction in their rates. The British Companies have now had a good shak- ing up: they have seen efficiency and cheap rates reaping their due reward: if they meet the compe tition in the right spirit and make a serious effort to bring their service and their rates more into line with the requirements of the firms with whom they have to deal^ their novel experience will do them no end of good* It is perfectly true that the German Line is subsidized by its Government, though r I fancy that the extent of the subsidy is often ex aggerated. But there is in this no reason for sit- * ting down under their competition and persisting in tne old system which can, as the Germans have con clusively shown, be improved upon. The German ships have, it appears, no difficul ty whatever in getting cargoes for Europe: the dif- ficulty is to get an outgoing cargo, and in order to supply the want the Hamburg-America line has, so I was informed at Basra, been compelled, on more than one occasion, to purchase a cargo and sell in the Gulf on their own account and for what they couldget - naturally at a loss. That the Germans have effected a lodgment in the Gulf is undeniable: that they will maintain it is probable. If however the competition is met in the right way there is absolutely no reason why it should prove detrimental to British trade. (Signed) Percy L. Loraine. Tehran.

It nay perhaps, with regard to this subject, bo of interest to note the following remarks mode in Ml recently published Annual Report on Tr«de by the Gorman consul at Bagdad:- The German Consul at Bagdad observes that the establishment of this new service of tho 'Hamburg Art', rlcmAmerican Line* has been the cause of a change in the general conmercial situation in the Persian Gulf Ports and at Basra. Already in May 1906, the three British Steamship Companies running Steamers between the United Kinsiom and the Persian Gulf (viz: the •Bucknall Line*, the 'West Hartlepool Line*, and thethe Britleh Linos vditch have nc retiUlftr utofn con'nu- nicRtlon oX tlieir ovai with the United States.

The Representatives of the )In iburg Amcrlcrn Lino both at Bagdad and at Basra are German Pirns of good standing, which have for some years already boon en gaged in the Mesopotamian trade. The first of the German Line which arrived at Basra In 1906 brought an unexpectedly large cargo, and oho found at the same time so much homeward cargo awaiting her at that port, that there was no more room for the goods which were awaiting shipment at Prgdra. The two following steamers which arrived in October and November likewise fovind full cargoes at Boera; and the Utoaner arriving in Decortoor brought out a -tullcrrgO from and doubtlaae was fuJ.ly laden on if Jj-i. her homawsrd voyaj'o.

The German steamers of this line and dates of arrival are as follows:- 1906 August 31st, Canadia. October 4th, Sicilia. November 4th, Savoia.

It has thus been difficult to obtain the material required for these statistics. my figures are however compiled from the original German manifests and both Messrs Lynch Bros, and the Kamidieh Administration have been good enough to give me their returns for local and direct cargo, shipped from the German steamers to Bagdad. It is interesting to hote that the Minister for Foreign Affairs has instructed the Vali to communicate direct with the Agent of the Hamburg American line in the absence of any German Consular representative. I am informed that the Anglo Algerian, Bucknall Bros, and Westhartlepool combination has decided to run an extra steamer monthly to Basra in order to com- and I have no reason to believe that he wished to dis- pete■■ h 1 compete more efficiently with the German carrying trade. It is anticipated that these additional ves sels will leave the Germans little outward cargo at the Continental ports of call for the Persian Gulf. Mr. Wonckhaus volunteered the statement that, as the English would not leave the northern ports alone, the Germans were compelled to adopt a more aggressive policy than formerly. I hear that they have already made Manchester a port of call and it seems probable that an attempt will be made to cut freights. As Mr. i i v*&gt; Lf Cf 2-. No. 322 , dated 21 st August 1906 .

A., dated 1st October 1906, regarding the time-table and doings of the Ham burg-American Diner Ca/nadia on her opening voyage, I regret that there has^ been delay in submitting this report chiefly owing to slow communication with Lingah and delay in receipt of news from Bussorah. 2. Before the Qxmadias arrival I asked the Political Agent, Maskat, to Resident to Political Agent, Maskat, telegram P ut a confidential native agent on board her as a passenger if opportunity offered, with a view to being able to report details without delay, but this did not prove practicable. I now attach a time bill for her outward and homeward journeys between Aden and Bussorah. The distances may not be absolutely accurate, but sufficiently so, I think, to show that the vessel did not stray during her voyage. 3. As regards freights, I have the honour to explain that at all events in the case of the Sicilia and the first few sailings, the Bussorah rates of freight are the only ones which can be considered to furnish any satisfactory guide, for the steamers have arrived from Bussorah practically loaded up and anything which they take on their way down is in order to fill up and would be shipped at any special rate which it might suit them to accept. The Canadia took about 2,000 packages from Bushire (of which the moiety represented Mr. Wonckhaus* own shipment) at the rate of 25 shillings per ton of 18 cwts. Pormerly the direct British Steamers to Europe u ed to charge 37 shillings per ton of 15 cwts., but about August last reduced their rates considerably, and I believe that Messrs. Strick, Messrs. Bueknall and the West Hartlepool Line, have of late had an undertaking under which they have been booking:— Rs. Rs. (a) Solid cargo at (£) Measured cargo at 25 to 27 per ton of 17 cwts. 25 to 27 per ton of 40 cubic feet.

From Bussorah I learn that the Hamburg-American rates of freight Were lower than those formerly asked by direct British Steamers to Europe, but since the rates of the latter have been reduced, the British Steamer Companies underquote the Hamburg-American to all ports except Hamburg, to which port apparently one uniform rate has been agreed upon. His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul is keeping a record of details obtained regarding the successive shipments of the Hamburg-American Liners, and I will report anything of interest or significance which may transpire.

I HAVE the honour to lay before you a report prepared by Mr. vice-consul Chick, in touch with me, on the progress of German shipping and trade in the Persian Gulf for the second year of the Hamburg-Amerika Line’s operations, namely, the period September 1907 to October 1908. / (A The first year was dealt with in the previous report forwarded with my despatch ^ No. 7, Commercial, dated 27th November, 1907. The material collected for examination has been on the stocks since February last, and I regret that we have not been able to submit the complete report before ; but it will be realised that the compilation has involved an immense deal of labour and applica tion, the leisure for which Mr. Chick has only been able to snatch at odd periods of respite from the constant interruptions of local routine cases, which ordinarily fill up his working day. For the last six weeks moreover the petty urgencies of the political situation here have absorbed the time of myself and staft almost entirely. Although the Hamburg-Amerika line have paid no dividends for the past year , although it may be the case that their position is still weak, and those concerned m the enterprise undecided as to whether the game is worth the candle; although, too, t le commercial credit of Messrs. Wonckhaus seems to be depreciated in the view of om own merchants, and they are carrying on business on lines which our nationals cannot imitate ! In spite of all these considerations, the statistics of this second y ear °f German campaign, seems to me to indicate that they have no cause to he chsappomte with their progress, rather that we are afforded material for urgent reflection and Thus, it will he seen from the information now furnished, that notwithstanding the fact that the period under report has been one of universal depression in shipping circles, the amount of outward cargo carried by the Hamburg-Amerika vessels has been very nearly double what it was for the first twelve months, while their homeward freig its remain almost at the same figure. a , . T Our own companies meanwhile have had a very had year. Messrs, btric , believe, complain that on their Gulf service they can only just make ends meet, anti Messrs. Bucknall have been in difficulties, and in any case will be running on very modest lines. Our merchants on shore, while disinclined to admit on principle that t icy are not holding their own, complain, as above stated, that the German firm is wor nng on lines on which they cannot compete unassisted. I can well understand the hesitation of His Majesty’s Government to embark on a system of subsidies properly so-called, the application of which among other urgencies ot Imperial commercial policy it may be difficult to limit to the Persian Gulf. But I must admit that if we intend to maintain our predominant interests and position 111 . lls region, the adoption of a definitely constructive policy both m commerce and politics sefms forced upon us, and how any policy is to be fully effective at present, which does not include some form of State aid to our trade I find it difficult to conceive I think it will be conceded that our nationals have so far been most patient and most persevering under great stress. Indeed, we know that more than one of t ic c le Manchester firms interested have of late been placed in great practical difficul .es owmg to the large amount of capital represented by goods and outstandings absolute y ie up m Persia owing to the continuance of the chaotic order of things which has now endured for ’unle^we come to their aid, enable them to cope on more equal terms with German enterprise, and take steps to provide security for their goods on the mam trade routes, we surely cannot expect them to persevere much longer in t.ie unequa and unprofitable struggle in which they have for so long been involved As Mr. George Lloyd has represented, it need not be a question of providing [2306 g —19] Copy sent to Board of Trade for observations, June 14, 1909. B !h§ ' h State subsidies for long or indefinite periods, but rather for limited periods on specific conditions for the accomplishment of a specific purpose. I venture to urge that the reality of the menace which the prospect of permanent competition, commercial and political, by Germany in the Gulf signifies, and the vital importance to us of killing it in its infancy if it be possible, cannot be gainsaid, and u ^ forwarding the present report I beg to express the earnest hope that the suggestions already made by Mr. Lloyd in the directions of State aid, now reiterated here, will be taken into lively consideration.

Interdependence of interests of Ham,burg-Amerika Line and Wonckhaus and Co .—In commenting on the past year’s operations it is difficult to separate the interests of Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co. from those of the steamer line. They are clearly inter dependent. That is to say, a scrutiny of their joint operations for the period under review shows that, on the one hand, the Hamburg-Amerika line would have had little import cargo, and practically no export cargo from Persian ports, had it not been for Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co.’s shipments; and, on the other hand, Messrs. Wonckhaus could not have maintained their new establishment except at a loss had it not been for the assistance derived from their agency to the Hamburg-Amerika line. Reasons for this Presumption. —It will be remembered that, previous to the advent of the German line, Wonckhaus and Co. confined their business to Lingah and Bahrein. Their subsequent establishment of branches in the other ports offers a strong presumption therefore that the firm were given financial inducements by the steamer line to do so ; for the small amount of trade then in their hands did not otherwise justify the drafting- out of another half-dozen German assistants to the firm. As to financial inducements in the shape of lower freight rates than those granted4 to other traders, we hear on good authority that shipments of pearl shells by Wonckhaus and Co. from Bahrein are charged Is. per ton less than those of Gray, Paul, an The monetary assistance given to the Hamburg-Amerika line by the venture^ whether by German capitalists or by the German Government directly would seem t extend even to a subsidised interest in the firm of Wonckhaus and Co. itself, though of this we have not yet been able to obtain a direct proof A German member of the firm of Heinicke and Co., of Shiraz, stated only the other day in Bushire that Wonckhaus Conduct of these businesses in 1907-8.—The trade operations of the Ger an firm at Lino-ah, Bahrein, and Bushire are reported, by those best able to judge to be of so reckless a nature that no British firm, relying on its own capital, could sustain the losses which Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co. incur over the extravagant commission offered on the purchase of shells, the credits given and the general nature of their terms at Lmgah, and bad bargains made, e.g., in their import of kerosene. + j- On the other hand, neither the efforts of the steamer line nor the trading company seem to have met' with the early success which was expected in Germany, the last two years have been very lean for trade all over Persia—and to some extent Mesopotamia—and the year 1908 has seen great scarcity of money and such a poor harvest that the export of grain from Bussorah practically ceased for several months the German steam-ship “ Savoia ” having to go down in water ballast to Bombay to find export cargo there. On the Arab coast also the great slump m the price of pearls m the world’s market had a most deleterious effect on commerce We learn, moreover, that Mr. Wonckhaus has quarrelled with his principal in Hamburg, Iraun, Sturc ^en and Co. over the conduct of the business in the Persian Gulf, and he has lor the last two years been absent in Germany, where he is reported to be engaged m en istmg further financial support. . m 4 - + 4 . Unprofitabte Results up till Present.—One cannot but conjecture that at present opinion in Germany is undecided as to whether the game is worth the candle in view of the enormous expenses which would devolve upon the shipping line before it wou c pay its way, and the need of a substantial subsidy from ihe German Government But Depressing Influence on British Lines. —On^ the other hand there is no doubt that the competition of the German line has considerably afiected the British shipping companies. Bates have been cut to a fine margin. Cargo, e.g., sugai% which was formerly carried in British, is now carried in German bottoms, and the subsidy grante to the German steamers is enabling them to monopolise direct_ trade from Burope to Bahrein and Lingah, which has been ofi* the usual run of the British lines on account ot the heavy expenses involved by the deviation. f As Illustrated by Freights. —The position in the Gulf has changed considera y or the worse since the report made in November 1907, for the intentions of German policy have become more apparent, and the benefit of lower rates of freight seems only temporary, i.e., until the competition in rates between the British and German com panies finishes. For the last year export rates from the Gulf direct to Europe have been below what they should be.

Freights for Suez Canal and other ports remained open to a “ friendly competition.” This arrangement however has not been strictly adhered to by the German line, who have frequently booked cargo from Bushire to London, nor as regards Canal ports. But it soon became clear that the ag 1 ’ 661 ^ 611 concerned more especially outward freights from Hamburg and^ Antwerp to the *u ports, which were to be left to the Gerinan steamers. Since early in 1908 no Bn is steamer appears to have brought cargo direct from Antwerp to Bushire.Effect on British Trade. —The trial already given to the arrangement has however brought to light the damaging effect on British trade which its continuance would occasion. The^ import trade from Europe to the Gulf, cotton goods excepted, largely ^consists of articles which have a continental origin, or are re-exported from the United Kingdom. The important imports of Austrian crystal sugar to the Gulf, for instance, have hitherto come chiefly from Hamburg, but the trade being through British firms established in Persia, and there being no German line, it has all been shipped from English ports. Similarly with the still larger amounts of Belgian loaf sugar ; this had been previously to 1906 all brought from Antwerp in British bottoms. Other secondary imports of this class are Belgian glassware, Swedish matches and iron, foreign earthenware, all of which have in the past been ordered from firms in England, and brought out in British vessels. The result of the British lines agreeing to leave Antwerp and Hamburg to be served by the German steamers alone, or their acquiescing in preferential rates being granted by the German line from these ports, has been to throw these classes of goods very largely into the hands of the German line and the German firm. The last few German vessels in the period of this report, viz., after the agreement was signed, brought to Bunder Abbas no less than 11,110 bundles of iron and steel bars and sheets ; the trade in Swedish matches in Bushire is now confined to exports from Hamburg, and orders are mostly put through Wonckhaus and Co. As there will be no means of preventing preferential rates being given over the German railway system to such imports as originate in or are transhipped through the North Sea ports, there is every reason to fear that trade in such classes of goods, both for Persia and Mesopotamia, will eventually be captured altogether by German houses and manufac turers. t Present need of His Majesty’s Government’s Support. —As far as one can gauge the 1 actual results of the German pressure, it appears certain that His Majesty s Govern- | ment must afford temporary State-aid to the British lines, to enable them, while the German position is still weak, to stifle the German competition once and for all, failing which the British companies of themselves will not maintain the competition, but will follow the line of least resistance, and come to terms with the powerful German line. . . . , Especially at Present Juncture. —It is understood here that new negotiations will shortly be opened by the Hamburg-Amerika line, in order to force an agreement on the British lines still more favourable to German interests, and the attitude of the British companies in this respect is clearly a matter of great moment to Biitish trade. It is further understood that the agreement existing amongst the Biitish shipping companies, which have hitherto formed the combine, is just expiring, and everything points to the Anglo-Algerian Steamship Company being left to bear the brunt of German competition. It is submitted that every effort ought to be made to support it against the policy of its powerful German rival. There is no doubt that it is of great importance that we should make use ot the present epoch, when the German company and firm are apparently m an artificial and unsound position, to concentrate every possible resource in the endeavour to drive them off the field. . , . ,. . . . , , T How Support might he given. —As far as we can judge here, this end might be assisted in three ways— (A.) By Subsidies. For all Ports to he visited .—A financial incentive seems the ^onty method of insuring that the Anglo-Algerian Company (or other steamers running in agreement with company) should visit regularly and frequently all Gulf ports, Bahrein Bunder Abbas and Lingah included, should call at Antwerp (and Hamburg), and should be capable of maintaining a rate war for a time. ,. , j . The amount of financial assistance necessary for this can only be estimated in London, but it might be useful to note, in reckoning the extra consumption of coal, that the mileage from Muscat, via Bunder Abbas, to Lingah, Bahrein, and Bushire, is about 778 miles, as against 582 miles from Muscat to Bushire direct; an extra four days would have to be reckoned for. . , . , Exnort of Shells .—The second item needing a financial stimulus is the export ot pearl and oyster shells from Bahrein and Lingah in Biitish ships. It was urged m Maior Cox’s despatch No. 205 of the 19th January, 1908, that the British India Steam Navigation Company should be induced by the Government of India to grant a rate ot [2306 p— 19 ] 0freight for through transhipment to London and Hamburg, which would enable the British lirm shipping to take a larger share of the trade than the half, to which they are limited by the Is. preference rates accorded by the German line to their own agents, in addition to lower freight rates. The market for shells has only been transferred o r recent years from London to Hamburg, and a preferential treatment accorded by a British shipping company to shells shipped to England might possibly conduce to these being put on the foreign markets at cheaper rates than now. Import of Sugar .—A third matter of great concern, in which purely commercial measures do not seem to altogether meet the situation, is the annually increasmg import of German, Austrian, and Belgian sugars, as against the Mauritius and Marseilles sugar, which until recently formed the bulk of the trade. The following figures are the latest available:— Imported to— Loaf. Crystal. Bushire Bunder Abbas Bahrein Lingah Mohammerah Muscat Koweit Cwts. 98,033 37,255 962 7,233 28,405 20, 12, Cwts. 39,504 24,951 f 8,137 &lt; (average about [_ 18,000 cwt.) 12,829 24,204 400 378 Out of the 98,033 cwts. of loaf sugar imported to Bushire in 1907-8 only 35,038 cwts. were of French origin—a large falling-off from the 41,097 and 109,753 cwts. from France in 1905 and 1906-7, whilst 51,600 cwts. were reckoned to be sugar exported from a Belgian refinery, and the balance was Hungarian sugar. The imports to Bunder Abbas, Bahrein and Lingah are altogether composed of Belgian and Hun garian sugars. Similarly, the import of crystal sugar to the Gulf is almost entirely confined to Austrian E.A.R. crystals, which are exported from a depot in Hamburg, with the exception of a brand S.P., which has been introduced from Germany by Wonckhaus and Co. It will be remembered that the German consul at Bagdad, in his report for 1906, alluded to the “brisk trade in Belgian sugar from Antwerp which had been opened with the Gulf ports.” There seem to be signs that the German steamer line is endeavouring to obtain the bulk of the carrying trade for continental sugar (except French), and should the rumour that the Austrian Lloyd intend to open up a connection with the Gulf prove true, the sugar business will be likely to slip still more from British hands. A re port on the sugar trade in the Gulf was sent to the Foreign Office in April 1908, and it w T as hoped that with this information, Messrs. Tate and Son would see their way to send local shipments of their article to various Gulf ports. In May 1908 a European named Guays did present himself at Bushire on behalf of Messrs. Tate, and inquired at the consulate-general whether a monopoly could be granted for the import of their sugar to Koweit. This was hardly a feasible project, and the Sheikh of Koweit refused to entertain it. Even if granted it would not appear to be likely to assist the introduction of British sugar into the Persian ports where we want to see it. Messrs. Tate’s representative strangely enough confined his inquiries to Bunder Abbas and Koweit, and we trust that his rather perfunctory visit will not be the sum total of their interest in this market. Under the circumstances the Board of Trade might advisedly be asked to urge Messrs. Tate to do something in the matter, and should the latter’s prices be too prohibitive to compete with continental sugar, as appears likely, further to consider whether some form of State interference would not be possible. Falling irvo Hands of German Line. —Meantime, there is a large amount of continental sugar being brought out to the Gulf in German steamers by British firms, which need not so be brought if the British lines could be induced to call regularly both at Antwerp and Hamburg and also at the smaller Gulf ports ; 5,049 bags at Moham- merah, 5,100 bags and 820 cases at Bushire, 6,655 bags of soft and 1,307 bags of loaf sugar at Lingah, 1,497 bags and 500 cases at Bunder Abbas, 3,797 bags and 1,460 cases at Bahrein, 15,154 bags of crystal sugar and 27,841 cases and bags of loaf sugar at Bussorah and Bagdad, representing a total of 69,200 packages, were brought by Germansteamers in the year under report, and of this the greater part are consignments brought out by the several British tirms, which would have come in British bottoms had there been British steamers to bring them. Crystal Sugar fiom Mauritius. As regards crystal sugar, an article of larger consumption amongst the Arab than the Persian inhabitants of the Gulf, Government has alreac y been informed of the attempt made from Bushire to assist the import of Mauritius sugai all round the Gulf. r I he Mauritius Government has been approached twuce, but so far only one firm in Mauritius has been moved to make a trial, the credit system of business in Persia being rather incomprehensible to Mauritius exporters. Altogether 150 bags have been consigned to Bushire, 100 to Dubai, 50 to Koweit, 50 to JLmgah, and 50 to Bahrein. I am informed that orders for 700 more have now been secured at Bahrein and 150 at Koweit. Mauritius sugar is handicapped in the Gulf market, even given its prices are no higher than those of continental production ; popular taste demands a whiter, larger crystal like “E.A.R.” The only way of assisting it to recapture a fair share of the trade seems to point to cheaper freights from Mauritius direct or vi^ Bombay. In March 1908 the freight by British India Steam Navigation Company steamer direct was 1 rs. 4 a. per 75 kilog.—exorbitantly high. The desirability of encouraging the export of this sugar to the Gulf by tempting rates of freight is perhaps worthy of suggestion to the British India Steam Navigation Company ; a rate of 8 or 10 annas per 75 kilog should be aimed at. Bombay is a central depot for the import of Mauritius sugar, and we have also tried to induce a British Indian firm in Bombay to try this sugar in Bushire, but without result as yet. A further measure likely to make it more convenient to merchants to import Mauritius sugar is a reduction of the telegraph rate to and from Mauritius to the Gulf. This at the present time is 3 r. 11 a. per word, a prohibitive price for merchants telegraphing small orders. As there were no telegrams sent from Bushire to Mauritius in 1906 and 1907, and only two in 1908, a reduction should not prove difficult or unreasonable. (B.) By British Firms not Shipping in German Vessels. It has been shown that out of the total imports to all Gulf ports, except Bussorah, viz., 125,863 packages, some 68,396 were either the own property of Wonckhaus and Co., or consigned to them for their clients.

At Bunder Abbas the consignees of the 14,368 bundles of iron and steel bars, &amp;c., are, so His Majesty’s consul states, exclusively Hindu firms from India, who imported them through firms in Karachi, e.g., Forbes, Forbes, and Co., and through Gray, Paul, and Co., at Bushire (Gray, Dawes, and Co., London).
