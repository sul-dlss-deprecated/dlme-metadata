[17491] No ' L Mr. Rutherfoord Harris to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received April 21.) g^ r 28, Victoria Street, London, April 21, 1914. ’ IN reply to your letter of the 8th April, I have now the honour to furnish you with the enclosed documents, in original, and with authenticated translations attached (see schedule), on which I rely to support the validity of my claim that no monopoly of the navigation of the River Tigris should be granted to any one company (whether an internationally-formed company or otherwise), because such a grant would destroy the value of the concession legally granted in proper form by his late Excellency Nazim ^ ^ ^ draw attention to the fact that the rumoured grant of a monopoly to a new company, to be created with the approval of His Majesty s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, prevents me completing my plans for the formation of the Osmame Joint Stock Company for the Navigation of the Tigris, because those associated with me fear that the Essayie concession may be refused recognition, and 1 should be mos orateful if His Majesty’s Secretary^ of State for Foreign Affairs would, as far as possible, be good enough to give me some assurance, which I may show my friends that the vahdity of the Essayie concession is recognised by His Majesty s Government.

I beg, &amp;c. RUTHERFOORD HARRIS. [2098 x—3] QUY t'O LUiG--*- | -5 MAY 1914[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Government.] I AM directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st ultimo respecting the navigation of the River Tigris. It would appear from. Yacoub Essayie’s letter of the 11th November, 1911, to the Ottoman Minister of the Interior that what he originally held was not a concession, but merely an “ aete de permis ” for navigation on the River Tigris with two tugs and four barges ; and this definition of the rights claimed by him is in substance repeated in article 1 of the statutes of the proposed Ottoman company. . It would also appear from the document signed by Nazim Pasha on the 13th (26th) December, 1910, that Yacoub Essayie was expressly debarred from transferring his right to foreigners, which, in the circumstances stated in your letter of the 3rd April, 1914, appears nevertheless to have been done in bebruary 1912. _ Sir E. Grey is under the impression that all licences to navigate on the Tigris issued by the local authorities in the past—and they have been but few-have been reo-arded by the Ottoman Government as subject to cancellation ; it is true that the penultimate paragraph of the document signed by Nazim Pasha may seem to e in conflict with such a practice, but this is a matter of legal interpretation. Whether, m view of the statement contained in your letter of the 3rd April as to the purchase of Yacoub Essayie’s rights, the Ottoman Government would _ consider itself liable m damages to that individual, appears to Sir E. Grey problematical. If the Government were 'in fact liable, it would presumably only be to the extent of the value oi the property of the limited Ottoman company, which has apparently never been constituted; had the company been constituted, Sir E. Grey doubts whether the Ottoman Government would have agreed to the issue of bearer shares, as, in such a contingency, it would have been impracticable to ensure compliance with the essential condition that the rights granted should not be transferred to foreigners. Another factor which would weigh with the Government in estimating damages, if any should be payable, would be the actual extent to ^hich vessels might have navigated m pursuance of the permission granted some years ago. Sir E. Grey understands that such rights have been exercised little, if at all, though on this point he has no certain knowledge. In replv to your further enquiries I am to state, for your strictly confidential information^ that a concession has recently been granted to Lord Inchcape, who has been endeavouring to obtain one for many years, for the exclusive right of navigation on the Rivers Tigris and Euphrates, without prejudice to the rights long enjoyed and exercised by the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, who have accordingly come to a working agreement with Lord Inchcape. Under the terms of his concession Lord Inchcape will form an Ottoman company in which, according to present arrangements, half the shares will be held by British and half by Ottoman subjects ; a portion of the Ottoman shares may eventually be transferred to Oerman subjects I am to point out in this connection that a monopoly of navigation on the River Tigris has in fact existed for seventy years or more, and what has been effected by the recent arrangements is that there shall be a larger British participation therein than In the circumstances explained, Sir E. Grey regrets that it will not be possible foi His Majesty’s Government to support your claim. The documents you enclosed are returned herewith. I am, &amp;c. TURKEY.

[March 6.] Section 4 . [ 9987 ] No. 1. Mr. Slaughter to Mr. Parker.—(Received March 6.) Dear Mr. Parker, 18, Austin Friars, London, March 5, 1914. EUPHRATES and Tigris. I have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of to-day’s date, and agreeably/ with the request therein contained, write to let you know what, on behalf of Mr. Lynch, are my objections to the draft contract between Lord Inchcape and him received on the 2nd instant from Sir Henry Johnson :— (1.) The most important objection is that this draft contract is completely silent on a matter which is vital to Mr. Lynch. By Sir Edward Grey’s memorandum of the 19th May last, which Mr. Lynch has subscribed to, it is contemplated (clause 3) that a reasonable working agreement shall be arrived at between Mr. Lynch’s Company and the Ottoman Company. Lord Inchcape pointed out that that would be best carried out by the Ottoman Company chartering the vessels of the Lynch Company, and on the faith of your letter of the 3rd February last to Mr. Lynch that was agreed to. The position therefore was and is that Lynch vessels are to be chartered by the Ottoman Company, and that in default of tbat a working agreement is to be arrived at between the Ottoman Company and Mr. Lynch’s Company, and it is the absence of any provision of any kind about this in the draft contract which most concerns me. (2.) Second in importance is the point that the draft contract now introduces an entirely new condition by calling upon Mr. Lyncli to be responsible for half what Lord Inchcape is responsible to pay or to procure the Ottoman Bank to guarantee to the Ottoman Government if he exercises the power of carrying on the navigation under article 31 of the concession, that is, before the new Ottoman Company is formed. Whether the draughtsman means it or not I do not know, but the terms of the draft contract clearly involve Mr. Lynch being responsible for half this money or half of the guarantee by the Ottoman Bank (see the third Schedule to the concession). This was never contemplated by Mr. Lynch, and never suggested until the receipt of this draft contract, and is a term which I do not think Mr. Lynch ought to be asked to submit to. The foregoing are the two most important points on which agreement has not yet been reached. There are, however, others of minor importance, namely: (3.) The draft contract suggests that the management remuneration which had been previously agreed should now be subject to some alteration at the option of Lord Inchcape. I do not understand the extent of the alteration suggested, but I do understand that there is some departure contemplated from the basis previously agreed (4.) The draft contract proposes that whereas Mr. Lynch shall only be made a director of the Ottoman Company when that company is formed, Loi;d Inchcape is to be appointed a director of Mr. Lynch’s Company immediately. The appointments should synchronise. nrari .cm (5.) While Mr. Lynch is to rely on the votes and influence of Lord Inchcape lor his (Mr. Lynch’s) election and retention as a director of the Ottoman Company, the draft contract requires the articles of association of Mr. Lynch’s Company to be altered so as to preserve the directorship position in that company for Lord Inchcape and his successors. This is practically impossible to comply with. (6.) As indicated by Lord Inchcape to me at the Foreign Office meeting at the end of January, Lord inchcape wants certain business of Mr. Lynch’s Company outside the navigation of the Euphrates and Tigris to be included in the management contract. Personally, I am in sympathy with the suggestion if, as Lord Inchcape assures me, this outside business is quite insignificant, but Mr. Lynch did not agree to this, and it certainly was never a condition of the arrangement that the outside business should [2067 /—4] ( 19H ;•&gt; v &gt; 1 •• • Co py to f c /T - £* i ■ ' . ■ Oju. 2 .3 MA.11914 i ^4 f2 be included in tbe management contract. Assuming that this outside business is comparatively insignificant, I agree with Lord Inchcape in thinking that it will lead to endless complication if it is not included, and on the above assumption my influence will be used with Mr. Lynch to induce him to include it, but of course I cannot bind him. There are other small matters of difference which I prefer to believe are merely matters of draughting, but points JSos. 1 and 2 above are really vital for Mr. Lynch, and unless they are adjusted might seriously jeopardise the position. It is right to add that I have not had the advantage of seeing Mr. Lynch or Sir Henry Johnson on this draft, although the latter expressed a wish to see me upon it when he sent it to me. I have arranged with Mr. Barnes of the Board of Trade for the method whereby Mr. Lynch shall fulfil condition 1 of Sir Edward Grey’s memorandum of the 19th May last. I met Mr. Lynch and his co-directors to-day and agreed with them the terms of the chartering of his Company’s fleet to the Ottoman Company, and I have arranged to meet them on Monday to discuss the draft contract between Lord Inchcape and Mr. Lynch. I ought, therefore, to be able to return that draft to Sir Henry Johnson on the evening of that day, and if there should then be any difficulty in his accepting my modifications of his draft I venture to suggest that the most speedy way of arriving at a settlement will be for a meeting to be fixed at the Foreign Office for a round-table conference between the parties and their solicitors.

Sy' ^ S4FEB1SU 1 %'^ s iCONFIDENTIAL. (10377.) 1 r i CN i ■'•'T BETWEEN the Bagdad Railway Company— hereinafter referred to as B.R.C.—represented by Geheimer Baurat Dr. Otto Riese of Frankfort-on- the-Main, duly authorised for this purpose, on the one side, and the Right Honourable James Lyle, Baron Inchcape, of London, on the other side, the following arrangement has been agreed upon :— Article 1. The B.R.C. is at present under agreements with the Societe de Transports Fluviaux en Orient, of Brussels, and with the firm of Lynch Brothers, of London City, concerning the trans port of material necessary for the construction of the Bagdad railroad and its branches, on the River Tigris from Basra to Bagdad. It is intended to cancel the said agreements. Con ditionally on this cancellation the B.R.C. and Lord Inchcape enter into the following contract with the object of suitably arranging such transport of material for the Bagdad Railway construction on a new basis. Article 2. The B.R.C. agrees to entrust to Lord Inchcape, and the latter agrees to undertake, the transport on the River Tigris from Basra to Bagdad, of all material, machines and articles of any kind (hereinafter collectively called “ goods ”) neces sary for the construction and for the working of the Bagdad Railway and its branches, including the port of Bagdad and including further any other construction work to be executed by the B.R.C. or by the firm of Philipp Holzmann and Co. (Limited), of Frankfort-on-Main, as far as the B.R C. may decide to transport goods to Bagdad by water. The total weight of goods to be transported during the construction of the Bagdad Railway shall not be less than 100,000 tons of 1,016 kilog. each, but in this guaranteed quantity of 100,000 tons shall be included the total weight of all •[286] Bgoods already transported or to be transported to Bagdad before the present agreement becomes operative by the Societe de Transports Fluviaux and the firm of Lynch Brothers by order and for account of the B.R.C., amounting, on the 1st February, 1914, to about 10,000 tons. Article 3. Lord Inchcape agrees to transport from Basra to Bagdad, on craft provided by himself, all quantities of goods delivered to him by the B.R.C. up to a maximum of 3,500 tons of 1,016 kilog. each per month, and the B.R.C., on the other hand, agrees to provide not less than 2,500 tons of 1,016 kilog. each of goods per month until the said 100,000 tons has been entrusted to Lord Inchcape for such transport as aforesaid. The B.R.C. agrees to advise the representative of Lord Inchcape at Basra or Bagdad of the quantity to be shipped during any given month, two months in advance. On special desire of Lord Inchcape such information shall be given four months in advance, but shall then be considered as an estimate only, and not as binding the B.R.C. Quantities up to 500 tons per month beyond the quantities for the delivery of which the B.R.C. may have engaged itself, shall be transported without previous advice, but Lord Inchcape reserves to himself the right to allow or not to allow the maximum monthly quantity of 3,500 tons to be exceeded. The B.R.C. undertakes to make the necessary arrangements for the timely delivery at Basra of the quantities of goods as advised by it. Should any of the craft employed by Lord Inchcape for the transport of goods be detained at Basra or at Bagdad for more than four consecutive days by reason of goods not being provided by the B.R.C., or of any delay, neglect, failure, or default in the loading or discharging thereof, the B.R.C. shall pay Lord Inchcape by way of demurrage 41. for the fifth and each following day for each steamer, and 11 . for the fifth and each following day for each barge. Claims for demurrage must be presented to the representative of the B.R.C. in time to allow an examination of the respective claim. If the representatives of the parties to this contract disagree about the claim, the final decisionthereon shall rest at Basra with the British consul, at Bagdad with the German consul. To the extent to which Lord Inchcape may- find it convenient to employ the steamers and barges in other work, demurrage shall be reduced or not charged. The goods loaded into the barges shall, as far as possible, be taken under lead seal. Lord Inchcape agrees to issue orders to his staff to help and assist as much as possible the employes of the B.R.C. in stating the losses and filing the claims with the insurance companies. Article 4. The goods arriving at Basra by sea steamer and delivered by the latter “from the ships slings ” (“ sous palan ”) will be directly loaded into and properly stowed away in the barges by the B.R.C., but the B.R.C. has the right at any time to take part of the goods to its magazine at Basra, whence they will be loaded by the B.R.C. into the barges. Lord Inchcape undertakes (accidents excepted) to provide not less than five steamers and eighteen barges for service under this contract and to make every effort to place barges alongside the sea steamers, so that their discharge may be made into these barges with a view to avoid the necessity for landing goods at Basra. The B.R.C. undertakes to arrange that the stevedoring of the goods in the barges will be properly done, and that the instructions of the skippers of the river craft will be complied with. Any costs which should result from the non observation of this engagement will have to be defrayed by the B.R.C. The barges arriving at Bagdad will be discharged by the B.R.C. along side the landing place installed for that purpose. The representative of the B.R.C. has to decide the order in which the loaded barges are to be despatched from Basra to Bagdad. The bills of lading for the river service will have to be issued and handled in a similar way to that hitherto arranged with Messrs. Lynch Brothers. Article 5. The B.R.C. pays to Lord Inchcape for each ton of 1,016 kilog. loaded at Basra the general rate of 22|- (twenty-two and one half) shillings. This rate will also apply upon all goods shipped and4 to be shipped from Basra to Bagdad uudei the agreement referred to in article 1 hereof, by the Societe de Transports Fluviaux en Orient and Messrs. Lynch Brothers, up to the time t e present contract becomes operative. The freight is to be calculated upon the weight stated in the bill of lading of sea steamer. Should this method not be applicable—which may happen in a few instances when goods are taken into the barges from the magazine—the weight shall be fixed at Basra by a representative of the B.R.C. and a representative of Lord Inchcape. The representative of Lord Inchcape shall present not later than the 5th of each month a statement showing the shipments made during the preceding month. 1 he B.R.C., after examination of the statement, but not latei than the 15th of each month, shall make payment for the said shipments in London. Specifications of all the shipments made by the B.R.C. to Basra shall be rendered regularly by the B.R.C. to Lord Inchcape at his London office. Article 6. Lord Inchcape will keep a special account foi the steamers and barges engaged in the transport of the goods, crediting to same all receipts and debiting it with all expenses resulting from them, including a depreciation of 18f per cent, per annum, on the original cost of the craft purchased for the carrying of the goods, the charge for depreciation to cease when the craft has been written down to 25 per cent, of its original cost. If in any calendar year the special account shows a profit of more than 10 per cent, on the capital used for the purchase of all the necessary vessels actually in service, and accessories, the surplus shall be equally divided between Lord Inchcape and the B.R.C. If Lord Inchcape desires to employ the steamers and/or barges for the transport of goods other than those comprised in this contract, no objection will be raised, provided that the trans port of the Bagdad Railway material will in no way be interfered with. The receipts resulting from such other transports shall not be credited to the Special Account, whilst vice versa any expenses resulting from those other transports (over and above those which would have been incurred had no such other cargo been carried) shall not be debited to the Special Account.5 Article 7. The B.R.C. heretofore, has been compelled to enter into agreements with third parties for auxiliary transports to Bagdad, amounting to 3,000 tons for the year 1913 and 7,200 tons for the current year. The B.R.C. undertakes not to give any further goods for transport to any other owners of sailing vessels or other craft, provided however that, if Lord Inchcape should—in three consecutive months — transport less than his obligation under article 3 of this contract, the B.R.C. shall have the right to the extent of such deficiency to enter into contracts for shipments on sailing vessels, the amount so shipped to be deducted from the guaranteed minimum of 100,000 tons. Should Lord Inchcape fail to provide transport for 75 per cent, of the goods tendered for trans port according to article 3 hereof, in each of three consecutive months, then, unless that shall be due to any of the causes specified in articles 9 and 10 hereof, he shall refund to the B.R.C. 3 shillings for each ton so tendered and not carried during such period. Should Lord Inchcape fail to provide transport in each of six consecutive months for 50 per cent, of the goods tendered for shipment according to article 3, then, unless that shall be due to any of the causes specified in articles 9 and 10 hereof, the B.R.C. shall have the right to cancel the present contract without any compensation, and to exercise, in its discretion, in any other manner the right granted to it by article 9 of the Bagdad Convention of the 5th March, 1903. Article 8. This contract comes into force at the date of cancelling the agreements mentioned in article 1 of this contract and expires at the time of completion of the Bagdad Railway down to Basra. Should it be found at the expiration of this contract, that the total quantities shipped from Basra to Bagdad—with due con sideration of the terms of articles 2 and 7—fall below the minimum of 100,000 tons, the B.R.C. [ 286 ] Cc&gt; til agrees to pay to Lord Inchcape a compensation of 11 shillings and 3 pence for each ton less than 100,000 tons. Article 9. Lord Inchcape shall not be liable foi an^ loss of or damage whatsoever to goods, nor for any non-delivery or delay in the delivery thereot, however the same may be caused, and even though the same may be caused by an) act, neglect, or default of masters, mariners, or other agents or servants whatsoever of Lord Inchcape. Article 10. Lord Inchcape shall not be liable for any failure to carry out any of the terms of this contract if the same shall be due directly or indirectly to any of the following causes namely :— The act of God, perils of the seas and rivers, pirates, assailing thieves, arrest or restraint of princes rulers or peoples, seizure by authorities or legal process, enemies, thieves, fire, civil commotions, strikes or lock-outs, storm, fog, flood, shortage of water in the rivers, or any other cause beyond the control of Lord Inchcape. The B.R.C. shall not be liable for any failure to carry out any of the terms of this contract if the same shall be caused by civil commotions, strikes, or lock-outs occurring at Basra. C Article 11. Lord Inchcape has the right to transfer all his privileges and liabilities resulting from this contract to the Ottoman Navigation Company to be formed by him, and upon such transfer, Lord Inchcape shall be discharged from all personal liability hereunder. Article 12. If at any time either during or after the currency of this contract any dispute or difference whatsoever shall arise between theparties, the same shall except as provided in article 3 hereof he referred to the sole arbitration in London of Herr Richard von Khhlmann, C.V.O., or failing him of an arbitrator to be appointed by the Ambassador for the time being of His Imperial Majesty the German Emperor accredited to the Court of St. James, whose decision shall be final and binding upon the said parties. And the said Arbitrator shall have power to obtain, call for, receive and act upon any such oral or documentary evidence or information as he may think fit, and the costs of the reference and award shall be in the discretion of the said arbitrator, who may direct to or by whom and in what manner the same or any part thereof shall be paid and with power to assess the amount of costs so to be paid or any part thereof. This contract shall be construed according to English Law. London, February 23, 1914. Witness: R. VON KfjHLMANN. RIESE. INCHCAPE. Witness : Eyre A.

IN view of the negotiations which it is pro posed should take place during the first week of February with representatives of the Deutsche Bank and Bagdad Railway, I asked Lord Inch- cape, with his solicitors, to come to the Foreign Office this afternoon to meet Mr. Slaughter, as representing the Lynch interests. I said that it was important firstly that all the British elements should be in agreement before entering upon the negotiation with the Germans and, secondly, as time was short and it was desired if possible to ratify our agreements with Turkey before the 15th February, and these agreements were dependent largely upon a settlement between us and Germany, that a time table should be decided and the objects to be achieved in a settle ment with the Germans clearly laid down. It turned out that Lord Inchcape and Mr. Lynch were far from agreed on several points, and it took nearly three hours before the two interests could be reconciled, which was only done, subject to the confirmation of Mr. Lynch, in the end by the annexed memorandum being agreed, and by Lord Inchcape agreeing that the Management Company It was agreed that it was unnecessary to say anything about the arrangements for the Management Company to the Germans, as Lord Inchcape, under the wording of the concession, has such power as is required for making the necessary contracts for management or other matters. Mr. Slaughter then suggested that, on meeting the Germans on the 3rd February, we should say that they had now seen the concession, which was participation should take place in the proposed Ottoman Company, though that was a matter in London should be called “ Mackay and Lynch ” or “ Lynch and Mackay ” according to the arbitra ment of a coin. (“ 19FE81S14 the platform on which negotiations should be conducted, and we should be glad to learn what were their views, subject to the terms of the concession, as to the manner in which German B 20 FEB 1914 [2001 hk —3]which primarily concerned Turkey, out of whose share the German participation was to come. Herr von Kuehlmann had told me that the German interests objected to the system of voting in units, as it rendered the German director powerless, and the provision would provoke muc criticism in Germany. I told Lord Tnchcape and Mr. Slaughter that the German Ambassador had in writing agreed not to oppose any special arrangements as to voting which might be necessary to secure control for Lord Inchcape, and that we could hold the Germans to this, and say that- the concession could not possibly be modified. If the Germans remained obstinate, then we should propose to pass on to other points so as to discover how far we were in agreement, leaving this to the end. Then, as a great conces sion, Mr. Slaughter suggested that we should agree, so far as the Turhish side of the new Company were concerned, to the alteration of the unit system, retaining it for the British side, which would be an alteration of form merely, as the Turkish side would consist of four or three independent votes (of which one would be German) and the British side would consist of four or three votes in unison, controlled by Lord Inchcape. This would secure the independence of the German director, while not invalidating the control of Lord Inchcape over the whole Company. It depends on Turkish assent, and a clause wdll be ready drafted for Hakki to tele graph to Constantinople if necessary, but the intention is to close the interview on Tuesday with the Germans with the impression that the concession cannot possibly be modified. We then passed to the rights of the Bagdad Bailway Company under article 9 of the Con vention of 1903 for the conveyance of rail way material. I read to Lord Inchcape and Mr. Slaughter the British counter - draft of December 1913 of article 4 clause (c) and the new German counter-draft of the same clause. They are as follows, alterations being shown by italics and erased type :— Article 4 (c).—(i.) It is, nevertheless, under stood that nothing in this article shall be held to affect the rights conceded by article 9 of the Bagdad Bailway Convention of the 5th March, 1903, except in so far that His Britannic Majesty’s Government and the Imperial German Govern-3 ment hereby agree and declare, so far as concerns themselves, that they adhere to, and will use their best endeavours to secure the due execution of the following provisions of the arrangement referred to in article 2 of the present conven tion :— The Bagdad Bailway Company’s rights under article 9 of the aforesaid Convention of the 5th March, 1903, aet eeati&amp;ae to he e^ewhsedr after the hist laaeary? - 1919 , eeless it is shewa that ee e^hep satisfactory Breaas are available fer tie purposes speeiheh het the sail article 9 , a»h hi any ease they shall cease on the completion of the construction of the Bagdad Bailway to Basra. Article 4 (c).—(ii.) It is further agreed that if an arrangement to the satisfaction of the paities concerned can be made for the conveyance by river of the aforesaid materials through British er Ottoman ageoey, the Ottoman Company for river navigation, His Britannic Majesty s Government and the Imperial German Government will use their best endeavours to secure the conclusion of such an arrangement. It was agreed that, so far as the British interests are concerned, there appears to be no objection in the alteration in sub-clause (c) (ii) : it would merely mean that the Societe des Transports Fluviaux would be dissolved, and, subject to financial adjustment with the German interests, it would make no difference to Lord Inchcape and Mr. Lynch. Instead of the Management Company in London having to administer three companies, the new Ottoman Company, the Euphrates and Tigris, and the Fluviaux Company, it would only he concerned with the first two, the profits of the third, or Fluviaux, passing through the new Ottoman Company. As regards sub-clause (c) (i), I explained that His Majesty’s Government did attach great im portance to getting a specific time limit to the German rights of navigation derived under article 9 of the Bagdad Railway Convention, as otherwise, under one pretext or another, there would always be claims for the exercise of the said rights. It was generally agreed that this was desirable, even if an arrangement such as that referred to in sub-clause (c) (ii) were con cluded even before the signature of the Anglo- German convention. [2001 /i/i—3] B 2 'Personally I think we should stand out at first for 5 years, then agree to compromise at 6, and perhaps, but this should depend on the course of the negotiations, agree to the German drafting of sub-clause (c) (i) if we are hard pressed, but subject to the insertion of the words main line of” before “ the Bagdad Railway to Basra. I then said that Sir E. Grey wished the British interests in the river navigation to have the first refusal of the proposed British share in the ports of Bagdad and Basra. Lord Inchcape suggested that he and Mr. Lynch should each go halves, and Mr. Slaughter thought that this seemed fair, and said he would mention the matter to his client. It was agreed, however, that in the negotiation with the Germans the British interest should be dealt with as one whole, leaving the details as to the manner of carrying out that participation between the British parties in terested for later arrangement, subject to the understanding that the division between them should be half and half. There is a change in the wording of clause (b) article 2 of the new German draft, where the German Government now assume a negative instead of a positive obligation, presumably in order to correspond to the negative obligation His Majesty’s Government propose to assume with regard to the German participation in the river navigation. It will also be observed that the wording is altered with regard to British participation in contracts for construction and maintenance. Finally, it is matter for considera tion whether the wording of article 4 clause (b) in regard to further issues of capital should not be adopted in article 2 clause (b). Lord Inchcape, Mr. Lynch, Sir H. Johnson, Mr. Hotblack, and Mr. Slaughter are coming to the Foreign Office at 3T5 on the 3rd February, if, as is expected, the Germans can be present on that date, when it is proposed they should come to the Foreign Office at 3'45. It was agreed that it would be best to take the negotiations in the order enumerated above, leaving the Germans to introduce the question of ferries when they like. If the ferries proposed are merely hand ferries, and so manipulated as not to interfere with navigation, Lord Inchcape did not think we could reasonably object. He adheres to his objections to German ferries and launches at Samara and Mosul. A. P. Foreign Office, January 31, 1914.ANNEX. Draft of Memorandum to be exchanged by Lord Inchcape and Mr. J.

Mr. Parker to Lord Inchcape. My dear Lord Inchcape, Foreign Office, January 21, 1914. THANK you for your letter of the 21st January. As to working agreement, I know it is difficult to frame one at this stage even in outline, but it is a matter of vital importance to the Lynch interests, as being the weaker party to the settlement proposed ; it is specifically mentioned in the Foreign Office memorandum of the 19th May last; and we do attach great importance to it. As a general stipulation of importance, the proportion in which the cargo is to he divided between the two companies seems a matter which, in principle, even now might he included in a working agreement. I believe the Euphrates and Tigris Company now handle about half of the cargo and passenger traffic on the river. The other half is, 1 understand, dealt with by the Nahrieh Company. , . Our feeling is that this proportion should be maintained up to the maximum capacity of the Euphrates and Tigris Company. As the capacity of that Company is limited, and the maintenance of such a proportion would necessarily be confined to the maximum capacity, the new Ottoman Company would not be under any great disability in view of the great development of trade anticipated. As to customs, the Nahrieh Company under Turkish management, even with immunities, was not a severe competitor of the Euphrates and Tigris Company compared to what the new Ottoman Company will be under British management. There are two ways in which the disparity of customs treatment might be dealt with in the working agreement,—perhaps there are more. There might be a direct compensating allowance to the British Company, corresponding to the value of the customs immunity enjoyed by the new Ottoman Company. There might be a provision that the freight charges should be such that allowance would be made for the inevitably heavier working expenses of the Euphrates and Tigris Company, by reason of its customs burdens, and it might be agreed that the rates would not be cut so as to debar the said Company from making a reasonable profit. In default of some such arrangement the new Ottoman Company will obviously be in a position, in view of its customs immunities alone, to squeeze the British Company off the rivei, thus involving the disappearance of the British flag, to which we attach great political importance. I am not suggesting that this is even contemplated, but the matter is obviously vital for the Euphrates and Tigris Company. Hakki Pasha has just telephoned to me to say that he has received the statutes to-day, and I shall see him to-morrow afternoon when he has examined them. But I believe he is free to-morrow, in case your lawyers wish to make an appointment with him, and, as time presses, I send them a copy of this letter. I do not quite see how the management can be taken over by you until the concession becomes operative, i.e., until our agreements with Turkey can be ratified. Yours sincerely, ALWYN PARKER.

My Lord, Foreign Office, January 9^1914. I AM directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to transmit to yon the accompanying copy of a memorandum, communicated by the German Charge d’Affaires in a letter dated the 23rd December, 1913, respecting article 8 of the British revise of the proposed agreement between the Ottoman Government and the Bagdad Railway Company. A copy of article 8 of this agreement, as drawn up in consultation with your Lordship, is enclosed for facility of reference, and a copy of the German draft, as communicated to His Majesty’s Government on the 14th November, is also attached for purposes of comparison. T ^.. n t + k The memorandum now T communicated by Herr von Kuhlmann lays stress on tinee principal points :— 1. The desire of the Bagdad Railway Company to establish connection between the two banks of the River Tigris at Bagdad, Mosul, and Samara by means of services under its own control. . t + w 2. The need for a sure guarantee that satisfactory services will, m tact, be established by your Lordship’s company wherever else they may be required by the Bagdad Railway Company on conditions acceptable to the latter company. . 3. The need of reserving to the Bagdad Railway Company the right of establishing, by agreement with the Ottoman Government, ferry services, &amp;c., wherever they may be required. It is suggested that the examination of these questions would be facilitated if the draft concessions and statutes relating to your Lordship’s company were to be com municated confidentially to the German Government, “ so that the latter may be m a position to define their attitude towards them. . . , , As regards point 1, the right to establish cable ferry services is already conceded at Bagdad under the British revise ; as regards Mosul and Samara, as these places are both above Bagdad on portions of the river where traffic will presumably be relatively less heavy than below Bagdad, your Lordship may possibly not entertain serious objection to the desire of the Bagdad Railway Company. Sir E. Grey does not, however, wish to press the German demand should you be opposed to acceding to it; and, in such a contingency, he would propose to inform the German Government that your Lordship would be prepared to enter into a contract forthwith with the Bagdad Railway Company for the institution of the necessary services at Mosul and Samara but that His Majesty’s Government would not be prepared to acquiesce m the proposal of the German Government on this point, which goes beyond the terms of the Bagdad Railwav concession of 1903, is inconsistent with the Anglo-Turkish declaration of the 29th July, 1913, and is still more inconsistent with the basis of agreement suggested to His Majestv’s Government by the German Government on the 7th May, 1913, where it is laid down that “German subjects ^should make no claim to participate m the navigation of the Euphrates and ligris. n As regards point 2, Sir E. Grey would propose to dissent from the German contention that your Lordship’s concession was at first intended to be confined to navigation up aAd down stream, and did not extend to transport between the two banks^e , t p atj in ^ event 0 f disagreement between your^ Lordship’s company and the Bagdad Railway Company as to what constituted acceptable conditions,” provision should be made for reference to an independent arbitrator of foreign nationality, and, failing agreement as to the arbitrator, that the reference should be to The Hague Tribunal. [2001 i—1] \ 23JM'H9 , &lt;4 •1 J3 JAM 1914 lAs regards point 3, he would propose to decline categorically to accede to the German request for the same reasons which are adduced above against point 1, and for the additional reason that such ferries might seriously hamper the river navigation and thus render your Lordship’s concession nugatory. Sir E. Grey does not conceive that it is necessary for the German Government ti? be furnished with a copy of the concession, or of the draft statutes, at this stage, or in this connection; but it may shortly be necessary to furnish them with a copy of the concession when the details of German participation m the River Navigation Company are under discussion. He would, however prefer to postpone communication of the statutes to the German Government until they have been agreed to by the Ottoman Government and 1 am accordingly to enquire how far the negotiations between your solicitors and Hakki Pasha with reference to the statutes have progressed ^ I am to ask that a reply to this letter may be returned at your Lordship s early convenience.

CONFIDENTIAIj. i 9, [December 29.] Sect i ok 9. [58388] No. 1. Memorandum communicated by Herr von Kuhlmann, December 29, 1913. (Translation.) _ . , THE amendments suggested by the British Government m the proposed agreements between the Bagdad Railway Company and the Turkish Government _ have been carefully examined. The amendments in articles 1 to 7 are not indeed in all respects free from objection, but it may be taken for granted that regard will be had to the wishes expressed so far as this is compatible with the safeguarding o± German interests. On the other hand, the parties interested declare that they cannot agree to the wording proposed for article 8. . They point out that the establishment of efficient connection between the more important railway stations and the opposite shores of the Euphrates and ligns is a matter of life and death for the Bagdad Railway. The latter, as is well known follows the right bank of the Tigris, which has no proper hinterland. The principal traffic will come from the left bank of the Tigris. The construction of bridges is a cos y undertaking in view of the breadth of the rivers concerned. How far it is possible to establish efficient communication from one bank to the other without motor power it is impossible at present to say. If an understanding has first to be come to with Lor Inchcape’s company before connection operated by motor power can be estabJished between the two banks, this amounts to nothing less than the handing ovei the tra interests of the railway, so far as the latter follows the course of the divers, to t monopolistic company, the interests of which, as competitor of the Bagcffid Railway, lies not in facilitating the access of goods and passengers to the stations of the railway, but in rendering it more difficult. _ . . x o :+ aCk \t The Bagdad Railway must therefore continue to insist on establishing , with the employment of motor power so far as this is necessary, a connection je ween the two banks at the most important points at any rate. Phis connection nius p the railway company in a position to transport across the river both persons an 8 coming to the railway from the further shore, or arriving by railway and requiring to be conveved to the further shore. This right is safeguarded by the German wording of the first paragraph of article 8, but on the contrary it is withheld by the EnglisR wording of paragraphs 1 and 2 of article 8. • ^ -u The principal points at which the Bagdad Railway requires to have the right to establish its own service from shore to shore, with the employmen o mo or po , Bagdad, Samarra, and Mosul. , , As regards the remaning stations at which the need of connection by motor power might make itself felt, the Deutsche Bank are in pimcip e prepaiei ° . ,1 an arrangement with the river navigation company for tie es a ls j, ^ ^ i* p necessary service in the manner proposed in the concluding paragrap o •, text of article 8. The English proposal seems, however, to be incomplete, ^asmucli as it does not say what is to happen when such an arrangement e ween i-,. company and the river navigation company fails, owing to the a 1:a 8 „ which, on a reasonable estimate of the requirements of the needs of the Bagdad in G are not acceptable to the railway company. ^ Provision should a eas ® , submitting to an impartial decision the question of the conditions or e es c of such a connection in cases where differences of opinion arise. n e ev T?. i Inchcape’s company not wishing to establish such a connection on ese con . •’in Bagdad Company would have to be allowed the right to establish the ^ on ^ e T ctl ° h n ^ e , In view of these difficulties, the most natural solution would be or 01 q t r p am content himself with the far-reaching monopoly of navigation up and down stream which was intended to be the object of his concession, and no o c aim also the traffic from shore to shore. +n The concluding paragraph of article 8 in the English text could be “ ter g, e • mean that the Bagdad Railway Company renounces in favour o r , navigation company the estab 1 islunentr^ sway connection from s lore o with or without motor power, /^.n unequivoc&amp;l statement is also nee e ^ e 23 JflN1SM ) ^ ~ Dff i&amp;y ,y Cory V R 23 JAN 1914 U.2 that the Bagdad Railway Company preserves the right to obtain authorisation from the Turkish Government to set up cable ferries, &amp;c., everywhere where it appears to the company that this would be advantageous. ^ It would facilitate the examination of the question if the arrangements (draft concessions and statutes) which Lord Inchcape has concluded with the Turkish Government with respect to navigation on the Tigris could be communicated confidentially to the German Government so that the latter may be enabled, if necessary, to define their attitude towards them.

A LETTER came from Messrs. Slaughter and May (No. 50009 of the 11th December, 1913) to-day which showed that there were still two outstanding points in regard to which Lord Inchcape and the Lynch interests were not in agreement: after some consideration I asked Mr. Slaughter to call at 6 with Colonel Picot and Mr. John Lynch, and Lord Inchcape and his two solicitors to come at the same time. I inter viewed each party separately first, and said that I thought the remaining difficulties could be overcome more easily round a table than in correspondence. , Mr. Lynch, who was very agreeable, did not quite concur as regards this proposal, as he said all the recent negotiations had been in writing and it was not desirable to depart from this procedure. I said that Sir E. Grey attached great importance to an early understanding, as negotiations would shortly have to begin with the Germans respecting the Belgian Company, for the conveyance of railway material. I said however that I would make it quite clear that the conversations were to be non-committal and tentative. I accordingly did this : I said the difficulties were two, firstly what was to happen if the management of the Belgian Company w r as not transferred to the Joint Management Company in London, and secondly what was to happen in the unlikely event of Lord Inchcape and Mr. Lynch disagreeing on the management Company ? As regards the first point, I said that Messrs. Lynch had already assured us that they would use their best efforts to secure the transfer of the management of the Belgian Company as desired, and, as that management had been confided by the Germans exclusively to Messrs. Lynch, there seemed to be no objection to the transfer of it, but if it could not, which was almost incon ceivable, be effected, then Messrs. Lynch would have to pay a sum equivalent to the profits they derived from the management of the Belgian Company into the Joint Management Company, of which the profits were to be divided equally [1963 m—6] Cory to ;5tdla 1G JAN 19142 betwesn Lord Inchcape and the Lynch interests This was agreed As regards the second point, it was agreed that in practice Lord Inchcape’s view, as that of the director with most experience of shipping, would probably prevail ; but that, if disagreement arose, there should be a reference to a referee to be appointed by the president of the Law Society. It was then settled that Messrs. Waltons and Messrs. Slaughter and May should meet next week to draw up the articles of agreement, which were briefly enumerated forthwith. I then read to those present article 4 of the Anglo-German draft Convention relating to the navigation on the Rivers, in order to be quite clear as to the course to be adopted : it was agreed that Messrs. Lynch Brothers, with the assistance of Lord Inchcape’s solicitors, should enter into com munication with the Bagdad Railway Company on receiving an intimation from the foreign Office that the moment to do so had arrived, and I pointed out that this would not be for ten days or more, as we were only just sending our counter-draft to the Germans, and it would be necessary to allow a brief period for the contents to percolate to Herr von Gwinner. All the solicitors present insisted very strongly upon the necessity of a slight alteration in the wording of one clause of our draft agreement with Germany concerning the navigation, as otherwise the Germans might claim more than was intended. They wanted the following under lined words added to article 4, clause (b): “ His Britannic Majesty’s Government declare that they will not oppose the acquisition by the Bagdad Railway interests of 40 per cent, of the share capital to be allotted to Turkish interests in the first allotment and the right in respect thereof to subscribe for a rateable proportion of f urther issues of capital of the Ottoman company for river navigation, &amp;c ” They said His Majesty’s Government could not possibly object, as it was a restriction, but a very essential one, in the interests of the British element. I said I thought there could not be any objection, and I am sending a copy of this minute to the Board of Trade. At the conclusion of the interview both Lord Inchcape and Mr. Lynch thanked the Foreign3 S Office for having intervened, and they said they felt confident that all difficnlties as between them were now removed. Copies of the concession as signed to-day were commnnicated to Mr. Lynch. A PP£Ms BQcniKsnt is the Property of His Bril T u l It m ^ ! ! ^3 I x 'h ASIATIC TURKEY AND ARABIA. CONFIDENTIAL.

If you disagree with it m any way you might let me know, and I will alter it as you think right, but I hope you will regard my attitude as reasonable. You have managed things splendidly with Hakki. I hope you are not over-straining yourself. Messrs. Slaughter and Mays letter of the 3rd instant, and I feel sure it will lead to a friendly and lasting agreement for the working of the Tigris navigation. So far as I can judge, there are only two very minor points which now have to be settled. The Foreign Office letter of the 15th November stipulated that I should have a casting vote in the Management Company. Messrs. Slaughter and May suggest that if Mr. John Lynch and myself should have a difference of opinion which we cannot settle ourselves, the matter should be referred to a referee. To this I have no objection, provided that in the first instance ray view shall prevail. If then Mr. Lynch considers his interests are being prejudiced by my action, he can call in the referee. In conducting the ordinary work of a business, some one must have the last word until things come to a deadlock and the referee is appealed to. In this case it must be either Mr. Lynch or myself, and the Foreign Office, recognising this has stipulated that it shall be me, and naturally so, seeing that the new Ottoman Company will bring considerably more business to the Management Company than the Euphrates and Tigris and Iluvia Companies combined. I anticipate no divergence of opinion between Mr. John Lynch and myself where our interests will be identical, and I observe that this is also Messrs. Slaughter and May s view. As regards the Fluvia Company being managed by the Management- Company, I accept Messrs. Slaughter and May’s assurance that this will be brought in, but should Messrs. Lynch from any unforeseen reason be unable to carry out their intention, the payment of the 5,000Z. in that event would, of course, not be made, and some adjustment in the shares of the Management Company would have to be arranged, because the Ottoman Company with its potentialities will naturally be still much more valuable to the Management Company than the Euphrates and Tigris Company alone. I hope, however, there will be no occasion either to withhold the 5,0001. or to divide the Management Company in other proportions than 50 per cent, to Mr. Lynch and 50 per cent, to myself. As regards a seat on the board of the Ottoman Company for Mr. John Lynch, I am quite prepared if things are satisfactorily settled to invite him to be a colleague, and I shall be prepared to work with him and the Euphrates and Tigris Company in all harmony with the object of conserving British interests in Mesopotamia, developing the trade of that country, and at the same time serving the interests both of the Ottoman and the Euphrates and Tigris Companies in the prosperity of which our individual interests will be bound un.
