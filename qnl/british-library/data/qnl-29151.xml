The Central Electoral Supervisory Council has issued an election notice to the citizens of Tehran and its suburbs to poll between 11th and 17th January. Elections in most other parts of the country are expected to follow soon after, but, regard ing Azerbaij an, the Government has stated that Government officials must first take up their posts (and, presumably, replace the temporary military Government by the normal civil one), and, as for Ears, the Government has laid down as a necessary preliminary the surrender by the tribes of all the arms captured from the Government forces in the recent hostilities. Internal Security A zerhaijan 2. Since the arrival of the Government forces in the province, conditions have been gradually returning to normal. The civil Governor-General, Ali Mansur, has left to assume his post and various Governors have been appointed. The immediate problems facing the Adminis tration are, firstly, the disposal of the Barzani Kurds, who are now in the Naqadeh region, secondly, disarmament, and, thirdly, the restoration of the economic life of the province and the distribution of rationed cloth, tea and sugar. The press reports the despatch of quantities of wheat to the province from Tehran, and these together with the supplies available locally should be ade quate to last until the next harvest. The trials of captured emigres and of locals accused of crimes perpetrated under the late regime, will be carried out, it is under stood, by those same military tribunals which are at present sitting on the cases of deserter officers, 3. The military attache is submitting a separate report on his recent tour of the province, and a summary of events based on telegrams from His Majesty’s Consul- INTELLIGENCE SUMMARY No. 1 1946, to 5th January, 1947 of 8th January; Received \bth January) General is given below. Immediately after the reoccupation of the province by the army, martial law was declared in Tabriz and the major towns. “ Muhajirs ” and armed Democrats were rounded up and an end put to lynch law. Prior to this it was estimated that 200 to 300 “ Fidais ” and others who had outraged the locals by their brutality during the Democrat regime, were killed by infuriated mobs. Early arrests included Dr. Jawid, the Governor- General, Shabistari, President of the Provincial Council, and “ General ” Kabiri, chief of the “ Fidais.” The latter has been condemned to death by a military tribunal. Many leaders escaped to Russia, including “ General ” Panahian, Chief of Staff of the People’s Army, and Ghulam Yahya Daneshian, Commandant of the Gendarmerie. About 300 leading adherents of the party and twenty-two deserter army officers were arrested in the early days. Since then further arrests have been made as wanted characters have been discovered. However, in general, the Central Government’s policy has been one of clemency, and this to a degree which did not accord with the feelings of the populace, which gave vent to them by closing the Tabriz bazaar on 28th Decem ber as a protest against the number of party leaders who had been released from custody. On 30th December Brigadier Hashemi stated that approximately 1,000 Democrats were still in hiding in Tabriz alone, and that to round them up would be a difficult task as they were being actively assisted by the Russian Consul, and because he had inadequate forces at his disposal. He stated that the Russian Consul was continually making unfounded complaints of the molestation of Russian property in order to discredit him. In this they were apparently successful, because, although he was carrying out his duties very well, he was recalled to Tehran and succeeded by Brigadier Zarrabi on 3rd January. As a step to restoring public confidence, Pirnia, the Prime Minister’s2 » &lt; Deputy, visited Tabriz and other spots to assure the people of the Government’s goodwill if they worked well to restore conditions to normal. Pars 4. Mohammed Hussain Qashgai has been in Tehran, presumably discussing the surrender of the arms in the possession of the tribe. He expressed himself as being most apprehensive of the intentions of the army, and the Minister for War has con firmed the Shah’s statement referred to in paragraph 9 of Intelligence Summary No. 50 of 1946, by saying that the tribe will be disarmed completely with the advent of spring. 5. Amir Humayun, who had won a degree of local confidence, has been removed from the post of Governor- General, and the Qashgai regard the arrival of his successor, Fatemi, with some apprehension. There appears to have been some divergence of opinion about the policy to be adopted towards the tribe as military representatives have been acting, according to reports received from His Majesty’s Consul, with a blood thirstiness which does not have the sanction of the Governor- General. The Divisional Commander issued a proclamation (of which the Governor-General claims complete ignor ance) to the effect that the elections in Fars will not be held until the tribes surrender the arms captured by them recently, and a further one stating that rumours to the effect that the amnesty declared by the Prime Minister to the tribe is invalid are without foundation. 6 . The Prime Minister has had a political success in that the tribal leaders have dissolved the Fars National Move ment and have asked for admission to his party. 7. Reference Intelligence Summary No. 39, dated 6 th October, 1946, paragraph 6 . The reports which led to the assumption that the Persian garrison had been mas sacred at Bushire after it had surrendered to the Haiat Daudi tribesmen, have been proved to be false, and His Majesty’s Consul, Bushire, now states that no such massacre did, in fact, take place. Isfahan 8 . The Tudeh Party is in eclipse with Fidakar in the capital and many members deserting its ranks. In addition, a new trades union, sponsored by the Democrat Party, is gradually ousting the Tudeh. It does not now appear likely that the Tudeh will put up a serious candidate to contest the elections. K horassan 9. The Tudeh Party Headquarters were wrecked by members of the Iran Democrat Party on 23rd December, and since that date some leading Tudeh members are believed to have been arrested by the police. Kurdistan 10 . Mullah Mustafa Barzani and son^^ of his lieutenants are now T under surveil lance in Tehran, and it is understood that discussions are going on with regard to their ultimate disposal. Mohammed Qazi and other Kurdish leaders remain under arrest in Mahabad. Appointments A .—Civil 11 . Ali Mansur (Mansur-um-Mulk) C.B.E. (F.O. 88 ; M.A. 164) to be Governor- General of Azerbaijan.

In connexion with the Government’s seven-year national development scheme, a commission from the American firm, Morris and Khudsen, consulting engineers and contiactors, is coming to Persia at the request of the Persian Government to carry out a survey in connexion with the loan requested from the United States of 2 J million dollars to finance the scheme. Three members have arrived and the remainder are expected shortly. Gendarmerie 16. The nomenclature of “ Nigahbani, ,; which was adopted a few months ago, has been abandoned in favour of the former one of “ Gendarmerie.” Police 17. The press announces a general increase in pay for all ranks of 500 rials per month. Military 18. The military tribunals sitting in Tabriz and Mahabad (according to press notices) so far have passed the death sentence on six army officers, and this has been carried out in four cases. Three junior officers have been sentenced to life imprisonment and one to fifteen years. The trials of four others have been completed, but the sentences have not yet been promulgated. 19. The reorganisation of the Azer baijan Division has now come before the Ministry for War. The major problem is the appointment of an officer to perform this task who is sufficiently senior and competent. The Minister for War stated that General Yazdanpanah had been selec ted for this duty but did not wish to go, and that the original nominee, Brigadier Alavi Muqaddam, possessed neither the requisite competence nor seniority. A final selection has not yet been made. 20 . At the request of the General Staff a mobile cinema van of the British Embassy Information Department is tour ing Azerbaijan for a fortnight to provide entertainment for the troops stationed there.

The elections for the 15th Majlis are, naturally, in the forefront of the news. Polling ended in Tehran on 18th January and it is expected that the results will be announced by the end of the week. Though seventy booths had been set up in various parts of the city, attendances were poor. Elections are now in full swing or just about to start in most of the other consti tuencies except Azerbaijan and Ears. The constituency of Talish, Gilan, has already made its return and the Tehran radio announced that Haji Agha Reza Rafi, Qaimmaqam-ul-Mulk, has been elected. He won the same seat in the last elections. Some disturbances are reported from Arak (Sultanabad) and Yezd caused by local opposition to the nominees of the Iran Democrat Party. 2. On 14th January a group of about fifteen political opponents of the Prime Minister took “ bast ” in the Royal Palace as a protest against the allegedly unfair method of conducting the elections. The chief members were the hysterical and demented demagogue, Dr. Musaddiq; his ex-internee son-in-law, Dr. Matin Daftari; Seyyid Muhammad Sadiq Tabatabai, the president of the 14th Majlis but better known as ‘ £ seventeen misqals ’ ’ (the equivalent, in opium-smoking parlance, of a &lt;£ four bottle man ”). Their allegations of misconduct of the elections were, briefly, as follows :— (i) That the elections were not free so long as prominent politicians such as Seyyid Zia-ud-din and Sannan- daji were kept in custody. (ii) That the electoral supervisory com mittees were not impartial since they contained members of the Iran Democrat Party. (iii) That unlawful hindrances had been placed in the way of meetings, use of their headquarters, canvassing, &amp;c., by other political parties. (iv) That the Tehran radio was reserved exclusively for the propaganda of the Iran Democrat Party. (v) That undue pressure was being brought to bear upon workers in Tehran to cast their votes for the Iran Democrat Party. (vi) That instructions had been sent out to provincial Governors to secure the election of Iran Democrat Party’s nominees. No effort seems to have been made to prove these allegations but statements denying their truth have been made by the other side. The word “ bast ” in this connexion is usually translated as ‘ L sanctuary ’ ’ but this is only partially true and refers to a fugitive from justice taking sanctuary in a shrine, a foreign legation or consulate, a telegraph office or the Royal stables. The privilege can be claimed, as in this case, by a group not fleeing from justice but demanding it. The custom also requires the owner of the premises to see that justice is done. This placed the Shah in an awkward predicament. Were he to do nothing he would be denying an ancient privilege of his subjects. If he refused to listen to them he would lay himself open to accusations of supporting his Prime Minister in unconstitutional acts. Were he to accept the truth of their allegations he would precipitate a conflict between himself and Qawam-us-Saltaneh at a moment awkward for each of them and for Persia. The American Ambassador, when consulted by the Shah, appears to have tendered good advice and the “bast” takers finally consented to leave. Internal Security Azerbaijan and Kurdistan 3. No information has reached His Majesty’s Embassy from His Majesty’s Consul-General in Tabriz during the past week. Dr. Iqbal, the Minister for Health, on return from an extended tour of Azerbaijan, confirmed to the Chief of 86-380 2 the General Staff, the reports already heard by the British Military Attache of ever-growing disgust on the part of the populace with the resumption of bribery and corruption by the police and gen darmerie. 4. According to the Chief of the General Staff, no decision had been taken up to 14th January on the question of Mulla Mustafa Barzani’s future and, in conse quence, no operations to disarm his followers had as yet been undertaken. They are in the Ushnu and Naqadeh areas. According to the same source, the Iraqi Charge d’Affaires in Tehran appears to have given up his demand for Mulla Mustafa’s extradition and is now trying to get a guarantee out of the Persian Government that they will enforce a residence forcee on him at some safe distance from the Iraqi-Persian frontier. Khuzistan. 5. Some underground activity by the “ Tudeh ” Party in Abadan is reported by His Majesty’s Consul at Khorram^hahr. Some of their leaders are in hiding but are active in raising funds from the workers with the assurance that the party is biding its time in order to stage a come back. Secret meetings attended, on an average, by about thirty workers are held in private houses and the usual attacks against British imperialism and the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company are made. Security in Abadan is said to have improved but to have deteriorated in Khorramshahr. Persian Army 6 . There is clear evidence of growing tension between the Minister for War and the Chief of the General Staff and each has confided to the British Military Attache his mistrust of the other. The personalities of these two high ranking officers partially account for this enmity but, in order to gain a fuller understanding of the prime causes it is necessary to make a brief excursion into recent history. I he organisation of the Ministry of War follows, in the main, the Belgian model and Reza Shah, mindful of the means by which he came to power, was the last person to diminish the role played by the Sovereign in this set-up. He further tightened his control of the army by installing, as a matter of policy, in the Ministry of War a succession of reliable and submissive dolts who could be trusted to follow no policy other than his own. He then pro ceeded to deal direct on all matters, great or small, with the Chief of the General Staff. After his abdication, his successor was prevented for the first four years by a watchful and suspicious Cabinet, Majlis and press from any attempts to follow in his father’s footsteps. Increasing lawless ness on the part of the tribes, increasing pressure by the Tudeh and the ominoigi southward infiltration by the Azerbaijan Democrats gradually wrought a change and the army exchanged its role from that of oppressor for that rxf saviour. This glory was reflected in the person of its Royal commander-in-chief and the astute General Razmara was quick to exploit the advantages. He pleased the Shah by following his advice in the formulation of military plans for the advance into Azer baijan. He consulted him in matters of armament. He referred to him even the most trivial details of daily administration thereby flattering him into thinking himself a commander-in-chief in more than name. He presented to him daily reports of the situation and morale of the army. On the purely political front the Chief of the General Staff had the closest relations with the Prime Minister and thus the Minister for War finds himself relegated more and more to the background—a position General Ahmedi has no intention of occupying. In the coming struggle he will probably pierce his rival’s defences in the only weak spot, his lust for money. General Razmara’s peculations are making even the Persian army gasp and, if General Ahmedi can prove these, he may succeed in ousting his rival from the Shah’s favour. 7. Reference paragraph 11 of last Intelligence Summary, the Chief of the General Staff informed the British Military Attache on 14th January that the number of Persian army deserter officers who have been court-martialled and sen tenced to death and executed for having taken up arms against the State is as follows :— At Tabriz ... 19 At Ardebil 4 At Mahabad 14 Total 37 8 . When discussing a written request for vacancies for Persian officers at military schools of instruction in the United Kingdom, the Chief of the General Staff informed the British Military Attache that he hoped to obtain sufficient credits in next year’s budget—the financial year starts on 21st March, 1947—to send abroad up to one hundred officers divided equally among United Kingdom, United States, France and Russia.3 V —' 9. Sarks'hgar Hasan Arfa (F.O. 17; M.A. 37) has been released but there are restrictions imposed on his movements. He was arrested in April 1946 under Clause 5 of the Military Government Act, “ subversive actions against the State,” also on a second charge of having furnished arn;s and ammunition to “ sub versive elements ’ ’ A court-martial, assem- * bled to try him about three months ago, had little difficulty in finding him not guilty of the second charge. General Arfa was in possession of written authority from the Minister of War of that time (General Riazi) to furnish these arms. The Minister of War, in his turn, had received oral permission from the then Prime Minister (Hakimi). Apart from this defence, the “ subversive elements ” were by this time “ loyal partisans of Govern- 'jnent ” bravely resisting the infiltration of the Azerbaijan Democrat rebels from the Caspian Sea to Kurdistan. Trial on the first charge was delayed by lack of evidence, the traitorous knave, Muzaffar Firuz, having taken the relevant dossier away with him to Moscow on appointment as Ambassador there. The court-martial, a few weeks ago, finally stated that there was no case against General Arfa, a bold utterance under the circumstances, for which General Naqdi, the Judge Advocate- General, deserves credit. No Persian has any doubt that it was largely General Arfa’s bravery, patriotism and firmness which saved Tehran from invasion by “ Muhajirs ” and Azerbaijan Democrats or from a seizure of power by the “ Tudeh,” or from both, in the dark days of November 1945 after the Persian army column had been turned about from Qazvin with the greatest ignominy by the Russian army garrison at that place. That he should have remained the object of intense dislike by the Russians and by the Tudeh is, therefore, natural. Unfortunately for General Arfa, his impetuosity, his tactless ness and his spiteful nature also antago nised General Razmara and his clique. It is not likely that the continuance of the restrictions on General Arfa’s liberty is due to any fear of the “ Tudeh ” on the part of the Prime Minister since that body is, for the moment, effectively suppressed. It may or may not be due to a disinclina tion on the Prime Minister’s part to give the Russians further cause for annoyance. It is most probably a move on General Razmara’s part to keep under observation and control an implacable enemy and a dangerous rival. Persian Gendarmerie 10 . General Schwarzkopf informed the British Military Attache on 12 th January that the total strength of the gendarmerie was now 23.000 and that by the end of 1947 he hoped to reach the figure of 30,000. About 3.000 of the increase was due to the reconstitution of the force in Azerbaijan where it is proposed to locate four regi- ments—two at Tabriz, one at Khoi and one at Rezaieh. According to the Chief of the General Staff, the budget for the gendar merie now amounts to 75 million tomans, or exactly half the army budget. In view of the growing rivalry between the two services, described in the following para graph, the Chief of the General Staff’s statement may be an exaggeration and will require confirmation. 11 . It is evident that jealousy between the army and gendarmerie is increasing. The Minister for War and the Chief of the General Staff are sinking their personal differences in order to present a combined front and attempt to regain administrative control of the gendarmerie. If they do succeed in doing so it will be over the dead body of General Schwarzkopf, the American adviser to the latter force. After the entry of British and Russian troops into Persia in 1941 and the disinte gration of the Persian army and, to a lesser extent, of the gendarmerie (“ the events of Shahrivar ”) the gendarmerie was removed from the control of the Ministry of War and placed under the Ministry of the Interior. The politicians, in particular, with vivid memories of Reza Shah’s regime, were strongly averse to a reconstitution of the Persian army in its previous strength fearing lest it should become the paramount power in the country, either on its own, or as a tool in the hands of a Shah who, at some later date, might wish to become a despot like his father. To this end they worked and schemed crippling the army by refusing to vote money or by bringing it into disrepute by a ceaseless stream of vilification. At the same time they strove to build up the gendarmerie as a balance of power. The Prime Minister is well content to have under his orders an obedient force distri buted in small detachments throughout the country. General Schwarzkopf is delighted to have direct access to the head of the State and to obtain without depart mental delays the funds which he needs to expand and equip his force. The argu ments used by the Minister for War and the Chief of the General Staff are, briefly,that Persia cannot afford the cost of two armies and that a great saving m adminis- trati\ e costs could be affected by unified control. General Schwarzkopf’s argu ments are that the functions of the two services are not identical, the army’s task being the establishment of security while the maintenance of it is his. Moreover, he claims, his tasks are rarely those of a military nature. His men do the work of rural police, they arrest malefactors on behalf of the Ministry of Justice, they perform preventive duties on behalf of the Customs, they collect taxes on behalf of the Ministry of Finance, they carry out such tasks as are allotted to them by the Minis try of Agriculture and, in the light of such functions, are more properly placed under the Ministry of the Interior. If his force was under the Ministry of War he would receive as officers the leavings of the army. His hands would be tied in the matter of promotions and discipline and, finally, much of his budgetary allotment would adhere to the sticky fingers of the Ministry for War. As long as the present Prime Minister remains in office a change in administrative control is unlikely to occur.

THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT SECRET PERSIA February 3, 1947 Section 2 E 1107/17/34 Cofy No. 160 MILITARY ATTACHE’S INTELLIGENCE SUMMARY No. 4 Period 20th-26th January Communicated in Tehran Despatch No. 37 of 2Sth January; Received bth February Persian Affairs Political Some provincial election results have been published and a day-to-day statement of the state of the poll in Tehran has appeared in most papers. The Prime Minister’s Iran Democrat Party candi dates appear to be winning as was to be expected. 2. Now that the elections are under way and the assembly of the next Majlis within sight, more speculation is being heard about the Prime Minister’s future actions in regard to his undertaking to introduce a bill for a joint Russo-Persian oil com pany in northern Persia. Most educated Persians, without pausing to examine the possibility of introducing safeguards to prevent Russian political infiltration under the guise of oil prospecting, are so con vinced of their own ineptitude and weak ness. and so thoroughly alarmed at recent events in Azerbaijan that they deny the practicability of any safeguards devised by themselves or by any one else, and take the extreme view that the granting of this concession or, more accurately speaking, the setting up of this joint company, will result in Russian political domination of the whole of northern Persia from Lake Urumiyeh to the Afghan frontier. Internal Security Azerbaijan and Kurdistan 3. The General Officer Commanding. Azerbaijan Division, has given the Kurdish tribes in the Shahpur, Khoi and Maku districts until 25th January to hand in their rifles. All of these tribes have carried rifles for a century or more, and with what they received from the Russians and captured from the Persian army are probably better armed than ever before. Their habitat is difficult of access and they can, if hotly pursued, cross the frontier into Iraq with ease. It is not expected, therefore, that the Persian army will have much success in this undertaking. 4. Feridun Ibrahimi, the Chief Justice in the recent Democrat regime, has been sentenced to life imprisonment. 5. A press report states that Qazi Muhammad, the leader of the Kurdish independence movement, Sadr Qazi, his brother, the ex-Majlis Deputy, and Seif Qazi, a near relative, have all been sen tenced to death by the military tribunal at Mahabad. The report states that the sen tences will require confirmation. F ars 6 . Fatimi, the re-appointed Governor- General of Ears, in an interview with His Majesty’s Consul, expressed the opinion that the Government’s aims in Ears could be achieved by peaceful means and that he was strongly opposed to oppressive measures. The chief aim, of course, is the disarming of the tribes amongst whom the Qashgai, on account of their size, and the Boir Ahmedi, on account of their pre datory habits, loom the largest. The Governor-General stated that in discussing this matter Nasir Khan had shown a reasonable spirit, but that Khosro Khan, his younger brother, might not prove so tractable. The Shah flew to Shiraz on 17th January, and saw Nasir Khan during the brief stay he made. The meeting is said to have been cordial. Some of the Kuhgilu chiefs have visited Tehran during the past week. K horassan 7. His Majesty’s Consul-General at Meshed reports that the local press is voicing similar allegations about rigged elections as were summarised in para graph 2 of last Intelligence Summary. Polling was expected to start on 25th January. There are only four seats for Meshed town and all the candidates belong to the Prime Minister’s Iran Democrat Party. 8 . The local administration has, at last, taken measures to afford relief to the famine stricken areas of Qainat, but of the 5,000 kharwars (about 1,700 tons) of grain sent there only 10 per cent, is fit for human consumption. 80-622 Mekran 9. His Majesty’s Consul at Zahidan reports that three prominent local chief tains have been summoned to Tehran. They are Muhammad Amin the Narei Sardar of Zabul, Mir Abdi and Khan Sahib Idu Khan Reki, a Deputy in the last Ma jlis and the great rival of Arbab Mehdi, elected to the seat in the recent elections. The first two ha\e obeyed the summons but the third has not. It appears that Colonel Karimi, the former commanding officer of the local gendarmerie regiment, made a false report to the effect that these and other Baluchi chiefs had been supplied with arms by the British Government and were planning a rising. Khuzistan 10. A local reaction to the recent mani festo by the Central Committee of the Tudeh Party has occurred. A number of ex-Tudeh members have complained that they have been let down by the party and that their funds have been embezzled. They now intend to sever all connexion with the Tudeh and form an oil workers’ union which will conform with the labour law and publish its accounts. It is dis closed that the late treasurer of the Tudeh Party in Abadan purchased from party funds a motor car costing about £4,500. The Persian Army 11 . The Minister for War informed the British Military Attache on 20th January that he had obtained a credit of 18 million tomans (approximately £140,000) for the reconstitution of the 3rd (Azerbaijan) Division with a proposed strength of 10,000 of all ranks. The same source also stated that the cost of the recent operations in Khamseh, Azerbaijan. Kurdistan and Gilan had been met by a special grant from the Persian Government of 20 million tomans, or more than £150,000. 12 . Brigadier-General Grow, General Ridley’s successor as Chief of the Ameri can Military Mission to the Persian army, in conversation with the British Military Attache, confirmed the reports given in paragraphs 6 and 11 of last Intelligence Summary of tension between the Ministry of War and the General Staff and between the army and the gendarmerie. Brigadier- General Grow stated that negotiations were now in progress between the Persian Government and the State Department for a credit of 20 million dollars for military equipment. Though the War Department, he said, had a great deal of combat equip ment for sale, he felt, and the State Department had accepted his view, that by far the greater part of this credit should be expended on much needed equipment such as M.T., clothing and medical stores. In putting forward this view he was meeting with much opposition, especialhjL from the Shah, who had extravagant ide&lt;^* of buying, among other things, a large number of tanks of the largest possible size. Another matter, continued General Grow, was causing the State Department some anxiety. This was the incessant demands by the gendarmerie for more and more equipment of a purely combat type. The State Department had expressed doubts as to the wisdom of supplying this and had pertinently asked General Grow whether the Persian Government intended to maintain two armies, and, if it did, whether in supplying them both with war material the State Department might not unwittingly be providing the means for a conflict between them particularly in view of the widely held belief that the army was for the Shah, while the gendarmerie was the object of the Prime Minister’s special and favourable attention. 13. In the Persian army, as in most other armies, the cry goes up from com batant unit commanders that their officer strength is depleted in order to provide for the already swollen staffs of higher forma tions. In the Persian army the complaint would appear justified since a source reports that on 1st January, 1947, out of a total of 5,036 officers in Tehran, no less than 3,605 were holding staff appointments in the Ministry of War, the General Staff or in administrative services. 14. The special military tribunals assembled in Tabriz and Mahabad are still busy trying officers and n.c.o.s guilty of desertion to the rebel cause. During the past weeik a press report, based on a General Staff communique, states that a further batch of ten w.o.s and sergeants had been condemned to death and shot. Economic 15. The Supreme Labour Council has fixed 34 rials as the minimum daily wage for Tehran district. In view of the very high cost of living in Persia in general and in Tehran in particular, this sum, equivalent to 5s. 3d., hardly seems adequate especially since no effective action is now being taken by the Persian Government to lower prices. Appointments 16. Abbas Hishmati to be Governor of Hamadan. •I3 Releases 17. The following have been set free :— (i) Abbas Hishmati Deputy in the last Majlis for Mahallat. (ii) Jehanshah Khan Biakhtiari, son of Murteza Quli Khan, a former Gov ernor of Bakhtiari. After Murteza Quli Khan’s removal from office, Jehanshah Khan was, for a time, co-Governor with Abut Qasim Khan. Owing to the intrigues of the latter with Muziaffar Firuz, Jehanshah was imprisoned on account of complicity in the Bakhtiari plot. Afghan Interests 18. His Excellency Rahimullah Khan, the newly-appointed Afghan Ambassador to Persia, has arrived in Tehran. Turkish Interests 19. Four Turkish railway experts have arrived in Persia. It is believed that the object of their visit was to examine surplus rolling stock which the Persian Govern ment had for saJle.2 Mekran 9.

There has been no excitement over the elections as, with no competitors, the Government’s party candidates are having it their own way. Though the Prime Minister is known to be considering the nature of the safeguards which he should include in any oil agreement to be con cluded with the Soviet Government, speculation as to their nature in non- Government circles is less in evidence, the average Persian being content, apparently, to wait for the convening of the Majlis. 2. The Prime Minister has addressed identical letters to the British, American and Soviet Ambassadors in which he men tions the losses incurred by Persia at Germany’s hands during the war and asks for the admission of Persian representa tives at the forthcoming conference on the peace treaty with Germany so that they may present their country’s claims for reparations. 3. Military Government has been pro claimed in Gurgan, Mazanderan and Shahsevan. In Shahsevan the tribesmen are believed to have refused to surrender the arms which the Persian Government provided and to have taken the law into their own hands in dealing with their recent enemies, the Democrats. In Mazan deran and Gurgan the reason for this step is unknown unless it be for the speedier collection of the arms, caches of which were discovered in connexion with the recent plot to overthrow the Government and interrupt communications. The Court 4. Two rumours connected with the Court have been heard during the past week. The first was to the effect that preparations for the Shah’s coronation were being made. There appears to be no truth behind this. The second rumour was that the body of the late Reza Shah was to be brought from Egypt to Persia for re interment. There is some basis for this since announcements of the proposed date of arrival have appeared in the press and General Kerim Ogha Buzurjmehri, one of Reza Shah’s most trusted generals and intimates, is believed to have gone to Cairo to make the necessary arrangements. 5. A good deal of rather meretricious propaganda on behalf of the Persian Royal Family has appeared in the press of late. A long article urged Persians to welcome with fitting gratitude the return of Reza Shah’s mortal remains to the land which he loved so deeply and served so well. The bravery and resolution of the present Shah, as Commander-in-Chief of the Persian army, in reconquering the lost province of Azerbaijan is stressed. Describing the charitable activities of Princess Ashraf, an article, sickening in its fulsome praise, likens her to Florence Nightingale. Internal Security Pars 6 . His Majesty’s Consul at Shiraz reports that a big meeting of tribal chiefs was held at Kazerun on 23rd January, at which Nasir Khan Qashgai and Fathullah Hayat Daudi were present. The handing in of rifles has begun, but most of those surrendered so far appear to be very old specimens. The light tank captured from the Persian army garrison which surren dered at Kazerun has also been returned. K urdistan 7. According to the Chief of the General Staff, Mulla Mustafa Barzani left Tehran on 28th January for Naqadeh, where he is to confer with his followers. The Persian Government has given him till the end of the current Persian month (19th February)2 to choose one of the following courses of action :— (a) That all his followers should remain in Persia, accept Persian nationality and be settled in five villages in the Veramin-Khar district, about 30 miles south-east of Tehran, which are crown domains. The Persian Government would supply lorries to transport them thither and they would hand in their arms at Mianeh en route. The Persian Government would support them and set them up in agriculture for the first six months, after which they would have to support themselves. (b) That Mulla Mustafa and about 100 of the more prominent among his followers, who have been condemned to death or imprisonment in their absence by the Iraqi Government for their rebellious activities of two years ago, should remain in Persia under the conditions set out in (a) above and that the remainder should return to Iraq. {c) In the event of the Barzanis declining to accept either {a) or (b) the Persian Government would take steps to expel them from Persian territory but not to disarm them nor hand them over to the Iraqi Govern ment—tasks which would almost certainly lead to a resumption of hostilities and which the Persian Government would be loth to undertake with Kurdistan in its present highly armed and inflammable condition. Persian Army 8 . According to a Tehran radio announcement and a newspaper article the Soviet Government has agreed to hand back some lorries which the Azerbaijan rebels had driven across the frontiers at Julfa and Astara when they fled. The Minister for War informed the British Military Attache on 2nd February that strong representations had been made by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs to the Soviet Embassy demanding the return of these lorries and their contents, most of which were believed to consist of stolen arms and pillaged goods. If the Minister for War has been correctly informed, the reply allegedly given by the Soviet Embassy was naive, since they agreed to hand back the lorries but said that the contents belonged to them—a damaging admission of their complicity. The lorries, said to number about 120 , will have to be towed as the Soviet Embassy has stated that they are non-runners. 9. During the past week a military parade was held at which His Imperial Majesty the Shah met and presented decorations to certain tribal leaders of the Kurds, Shahsevans and Talish in recogni tion of their services to the country duriiyv the recent struggle against the Azerbaija** Democrat rebels. Persian Navy 10 . Permission has, at last, been received from the Admiralty for two Persian naval officers to proceed to the United Kingdom to discuss the rehabilitation of the Persian navy. They are expected to leave Tehran by air on 13th February. 11 . The Chief of the General Staff informed the British Military Attache on 1 st February that he had found a successful solution—if only a temporary one—of the financial difficulties with which the Minis try of War were faced in providing funds for the upkeep of the Persian navy even on its present limited scale. He had proved to the Ministry of Finance that the present activities of the navy were solely those of a preventive service on behalf of the Customs Department and that the cost should be borne by that department. To this the Minister of Finance had agreed and, at present, the maintenance and operating costs of such craft as the navy still possesses, the clothing, accommodation, feeding and pay of the officers and men are all being paid for by that Ministry. Communications 12 . In a communique to the press the Minister for Roads and Communications stated that the Ministry’s present budget of 110 million rials is totally inadequate for the efficient upkeep of 27,000 kilom. of roads and that, over and above the proposed tax of 50 dinars per litre of petrol which would only yield 50 million rials, his Minis try would require a further grant of 500 million rials if it was to carry out construc tional improvements and asphalting of the main routes. Referring to railways the Minister gave the following particulars concerning partially completed sections (i) Mianeh—Tabriz : 300 kilom.; 5 per cent, to 35 per cent, completed; earthwork nearly complete; cul verts, bridges, tunnels, buildings and rail-laying nil; estimated cost of completion 970 million rials. (ii) Shahrud-Meshed : 500 kilom; first 200 kilom. complete except for rail laying, remainder 5 per cent, to 55 per cent, complete; estimated cost of completion 200 million rials.(iii) Qum-Kashan : completed in every respect except rail-laying; esti mated cost of completion 24 million rials. To sum up, the Ministry’s requirements for roads amount to an annual grant of over £1 million sterling and a non-recurring grant of about £4 million sterling. For railway completion it requires £10 million sterling spread over a period of, say, four years.

All of them are members of the Democrat Party :— Ahmed Qawam (Qawam-us-Saltianeh). Dr. Ali Amini (F.O. 6 ). Khusro Hidayat. Dr. Jalal Abduh. Dr. Javad Ashtiani. Abdul Hussein Nikpur. Abul Hassan Sadiqi. Abbas Ma-sudi (F.O. 91). Sayyid Ali Behbehani. Malik-ush-Shuara Bahar (F.O. 25). Sayyid Hashim Vakil. Ali V^kili. Dr. Rozazadeh Shafaq. Dr. Shafaq will not get in if Qawam retains his deputyship. His intentions in this matter are not yet known, but a new interpretation of the Constitutional Law is being mooted whereby the Prime Minis ter does not count as a “ Minister ” in the sense of the ruling which excludes Ministers from election as Deputies. 2. In the provinces elections are con tinuing and some results have been published. These will be reported when sufficient candidates have been elected to provide the requisite quorum for convening the Majlis. 3. Despite officially inspired denials in the press there is some evidence of growing tension between the Shah and the Prime Minister. Ever since the successful re occupation of Azerbaijan a certain section of the press has been at pains to stress the outstanding part played by the Shah as father of his country and commander-in chief of its armed forces. Relations were further strained by the episode of the “ bast ” of Dr. Musaddiq (see paragraph 2 of Intelligence Summary No. 3). The growing rivalry between the army, popu larly supposed to be solid for the Shah, and the gendarmerie, universally believed to be the tool of the Prime Minister, has already been mentioned in paragraph 11 of Intef- ligence Summary No. 3. A Royalist pro paganda drive in the press was noticed in paragraph 5 of last Intelligence Summary. The Prime Minister is believed to be on bad terms with the Chief of the General Staff, whom he accuses of interfering in the elections and of abetting the Shah in his designs for more active interference in the administration of the army. Mr. Nikpay, the Prime Minister’s assistant, has now informed His Majesty’s Ambas sador that the army are taking the bit between the teeth in Azerbaijan and are obstructing the administration of Ali Mansur, the new Governor-General. Mr. Nikpay, in speaking of the elections, hinted broadly that the Shah was inter fering in various constituencies, e.g., Isfahan, where Nikpay himself is a candi date, to secure the election of persons who do not owe allegiance to the Prime Minis ter and his party. Lavish entertainment by the army of numerous visiting tribal chiefs is held by some to indicate a ganging-up with the tribes by the Shah and his army against the Prime Minister. Internal Security Tribal General 4. During the past fortnight a large number of tribal chiefs have been visiting Tehran as guests of the army. The Shahsavan, Talish, Kurds, Kuh-i-galu and Boir Ahmedi have been represented. They have been lavishly entertained and have visited military formations in Tehran. In some cases, e.g., the Shahsavan and Kurds, medals were presented to them by the Shah to mark the services they had rendered in recent hostilities against the Azerbaijan rebels, and all have received gifts in some form or another. (Four Kurds have had an audience with the Shah, who2 presented each with a diamond ring.) The object appears to be the dual one of impressing these tribal representatives with the strength of the armed forces in the capital and of the goodwill of the Government towards them. The recent visit of the Shah to Shiraz and a rumour of a forthcoming visit of Nasir Khan Qashgai to the capital lends colour to the view that the Government may at last be considering the adoption of a tribal policy, and may be endeavouring, by establishing friendly relations with the chiefs, to ensure at least a partial degree of disarmament without the necessity of having to resort to military operations. Fars 5. The press has reported that Nasir Khan Qashgai will be visiting Tehran shortly. While this may be nothing more than a return visit to that paid by the Shah recently to Shiraz, it may, on the other hand, be part of the general enter tainment of tribal chiefs which has been noticed in recent weeks. K huzistan 6 . Reference paragraph 10 of Intelli gence Summary No. 4 of 1947. His Majesty’s Consul, Khorramshahr, reports that the Oil Workers’ Union has made as yet little progress. Neither have they been officially registered nor have they estab lished a headquarters. Moreover, workers, recalling the recently revealed scandal of misappropriation of party funds by the Tudeh treasurer, are very suspicious of this new union. French Interests 7. The press published on 7th February the text of a financial agreement between France and Iran. The text is lengthy, con sisting of twelve articles and a protocol of three more. This is, however, only the pro posed treaty as passed by the Cabinet, and it has not yet been signed by the Govern ments concerned. British Interests 8 . An order has been placed by the Government for the re-equipment of the Tehran telephone system with the G.E.C. Company. The order is of a value of £1 million and includes four automatic exchanges. It is to be completed in two Russian Interests 9. His Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz, reports that the Soviet Consulate there, opened in August 1946, has now been closed.

The separate names of ranks for officers of the Police Force have been abolished, and they will in future be known by the ranks of equivalent officers of the army, e.g., a “ Pasyar ” will in future be known as a “ Sarhang ” (colonel), and a “ Yavar ” as a “ Sargurd ” (major).87-82 B ) THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT SECRET PERSIA March 6, 1947 Section 1 E 1934/17/34 Cofy No. 163 PERSIA: MILITARY ATTACHE’S iMfiLilOT^^lffUMMARY No. 7 Period 10th-23rd February, 1947 (Communicated in Tehran Despatch No. 66 of 26£A February; Received §th March) Persian Affairs Political Reference paragraph 2 of Intelligence Summary No. 5, the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs has addressed the following telegram to the Secretary-General of the Foreign Ministers’ Council in London :— “ On the instructions of my Govern ment, I beg to inform you of the request of the Iranian Government to partici pate in the German Peace Conference and its relevant committees. I therefore request you to submit my Government’s request to the Foreign Ministers’ Council and also to the Foreign Ministers’ Deputies now meeting in London. “ Iran declared war on Germany and is a signatory to the United Nations Charter. Iran also signed the Tripartite Agreement with Great Britain and the LT.S.S.R. and placed all its resources, from 1941 onwards, at the disposal of the Allies, and thus facilitated the ultimate common victory of the Allies. The Allied Governments, too, during the war, on various occasions showed a sympathetic attitude towards our subjects.” from the Provincial Supervisory Committee and, finally, the Majlis, after it has been convened, has to accept the credentials. A complete descriptive list of the Deputies will, therefore, be compiled only after the above formalities have been completed. In general, it may be said that all those elected so far are either members of the Prime Minister’s Iran Democrat Party or are on his list of approved candidates. His Majesty’s Consuls have reported on the con duct of the elections in their consular districts and the consensus of opinion is that little, if any, manipulation of the polls occurred, such as tampering with the ballot boxes, falsification of the count or intimi dation of voters, probably because there was no need to do so in view of the fact that the result was a foregone conclusion. The rigging of the elections consisted more of the preliminaries, such as the suppression of rival parties, incarceration of rival can didates, the issue of instructions to pro vincial officials as to the persons who were to be elected and. finally, the inclusion in the supervisory boards of members of the Prime Minister’s Party, and, in some cases, of the candidates themselves. The Elections 2 . The list of twelve Deputies elected for Tehran was given in paragraph 1 of last Intelligence Summary. A further list of fifty-seven provincial results, up to 22 nd February, is given in an appendix to this summary. Thus, exactly half the total number of Deputies has been elected. Elections are now in progress in Behbehan, Isfahan, Sabzevar and Kashan. They have not yet started in Azerbaijan, Ears, Kur distan, Hamadan and Khuzistan. One Deputy has also to be elected by each of the following communities : the northern Armenians, the southern Armenians, the Assyrians, the Zoroastrians and the Jews. It must be understood that the results are, so far, only provisional as, firstly, the elected Deputy has to signify his willing ness to accept the seat, the Ministry of the Interior has to issue his credentials after receipt of a “no objection ” certificate Internal Security Kurdistan 3. The Persian Chief of the General Staff informed the British Military Attache on 18th February that Mulla Mustafa Barzani had failed to persuade any of his followers or the Iraqi army deserters to accept the Persian Government’s offer of settlement near Tehran. The whole tribe, therefore, had started to return to Iraq. They were avoiding the main Rowanduz road and intended using devious and diffi cult mountain tracks between the road on the south and the junction of the inter national boundaries of Turkey, Persia and Iraq at Ulugh Dagh on the north. Two’ Persian army columns moving westwards from Ushnu and Rezaieh were shepherding them from a discreet distance in the rear to ensure that they did actually cross the frontier and that they provoked no local hostilities en route. The Chief of the2 i General Staff intends to send out a recon naissance sortie of the Persian Air Force in a few days’ time to locate their position. 4. Four columns based on Mahabad, Ushnu. Rezaieh and Khoi are moving west wards to continue disarming the Kurds but the presence of the Barzanis on Persian soil has delayed the start, as the General Staff did not wish to add to its difficulties by having a clash with the rear parties of this tribe now at last on its way back to Iraq. Friendly contact, both in Tehran and Azerbaijan, is being maintained as far as possible with the Kurdish chiefs in the hopes that they may be induced to sur render their arms without recourse to operations. Amar Khan Shakkak is reported to be on his way to Tehran for conversations in this respect. Azerbaijan 5. His Majesty’s Consul-General at Tabriz has produced evidence which refutes the accusation of supineness made by the Prime Minister’s assistant against Ali Mansur, the Governor-General of Azer baijan. No one acquainted with his character could make this accusation seriously and one reason for it almost cer tainly lies in his refusal to accept the Prime Minister’s Tehran carpet baggers in place of Azerbaijanis as candidates for the elections. Ali Mansur can get neither the money nor the honest and capable officials he requires. The re-erection of the govern mental machine in an area which, for all practical purposes, ceased to be a part of Persia for a year naturally takes time. About a third of his entire province is tribal territory now in process of being dis armed and in these areas, obviously, recon stitution of the civil power must wait upon the successful completion of military operations. To add to his difficulties a whispering campaign, of Russian origin, carried out by former supporters of the Azerbaijan Democrat regime, aims at undermining confidence in the Central Government and creating an atmosphere of mistrust. 6 . Accusations of corruption have been made against the army and are almost cer tainly well founded since the army is in no way behind other departments in this respect. General Zarrabi. according to His Majesty’s Consul-General, is not turning a blind eye to this and has sus pended four officers suspected of accepting bribes. With the notable and serious excep tion. referred to in paragraph 11 below, accusations of high-handed behaviour appear to be less well founded since His Majesty’s Consul-General reports that General Zarrabi, impatient at the law’s delays, himself investigated the cases pending against several persons suspected of complicity in the late regime and, in the course of one day, liberated fifty-five of them. 7. Reports reaching Tabriz say that the Russians are still detaining in a con centration camp near Nakhjawan those ^ “ Muhajirs,” Armenians and “ Fidais ” ’ who fled across the border when the inde pendence movement collapsed. They are said to be employed on forced labour and to be kept on a starvation diet. A report from the American Assistant Military Attache confirms this. While recently at Astara he saw an ex-sergeant of the Persian army who had deserted to the Azerbaijan People’s Army and had been promoted to captain in that force. After the fall of Astara he and his battalion of conscripts ( “ Kizilbashes ”) had crossed the frontier into Russia, been disarmed, moved by rail for two days and put into a concentration camp as prisoners of war at a place in the Caucasus unidentified but probably near Lankoran. When he and his companions remonstrated against such treatment at the hands of their erstwhile supporters the Russians told him he must be dreaming as they knew nothing of any Azerbaijan Democrat army and had never supported such a force in any way. The ex-sergeant escaped and, after making his way. partly by rail and partly on foot, suc ceeded in crossing the frontier at Astara, where he surrendered to the Persian com mander exclaiming that he was fully aware of the punishment which awaited him for desertion to the rebel cause but that he pre ferred being shot in Persia to being alive in a Russian concentration camp. Fars 8 . The Governor-General of Fars, accom panied by Nasir Khan Qashgai and Fathullah Hayat Daudi, has arrived in Tehran. The object of the journey, according to His Majesty’s Consul in Shiraz, is “ to effect a general reconciliation between the Central Government and the tribes of Fars.'’ In Tehran it is believed, however, that the visit, at any rate in so far as Nasir Khan and Fathullah are con cerned, is more probably connected with the Shah than with the Prime Minister (see last sentence of paragraph 3 of Last Intelli gence Summary) and that some sort of bar gain may be struck whereby, in return for securing the election in Fars of candidates favourable to the Shah, the southern tribes will be let down lightly when their turn comes to be disarmed. Another and obvious3 t purpose of the visit is to lay before the Persian Government the proposals of the “ Pars Society,” a rather pallid descendant of the Pars Autonomy Movement of last autumn. A petition, signed by prominent Farsis resident in the capital and in Pars, as been presented to the Prime Minister, t is a much-watered-down version of the “ demands ” made by Nasir Khan at the conclusion of last year’s hostilities (see paragraph 10 of Intelligence Summary No. 41 of 1946) and consists of “ requests ” of the reconstruction and rehabilitation of Pars within the framework of the Persian Government’s seven-year plan. It specially mentions the construction of docks at Bushire and Lingeh (a senseless project), the extension of the Iranian State Railway from Qum to Isfahan, Shiraz and Bushire (an utterly impracticable scheme which would cost £20 million) and “ the creation of an atmosphere in Pars in which people could pursue their legitimate occupations in peace and security.” This alone of the desiderata is in the realm of practical politics and could be realised speedily and at no cost if the Qashgai and other tribes would only permit it. Persian Army 9. A purchasing mission of twenty officers, headed by General Abdullah Hidayet, the Deputy Minister for War, is to leave for America shortly. Para graph 12 of Intelligence Summary No. 4 referred to a credit of 20 million dollars secured from the United States by the Persian Government. The outcome of the dispute between General Grow and the Shah as to the proportion of combat equip ment to be purchased is not yet known. 10 . General Amanullah Jehanbani has returned from his brief tour of military training establishments in the United Kingdom, France and Belgium. 11 . Reference was made in paragraph 3 of Intelligence Summary No. 6 to the allegations made by the Prime Minister against the high-handed actions of the military in Azerbaijan. The Ministry for War, on 18th February, issued a com munique denying the truth of these allega tions and saying that they were the work of malicious persons who were seeking to create disunity between the people and the army. Despite this denial, however, the Minister for War informed the British Military Attache on 17th February, in strict confidence, that one very serious incident had been reported to him from Ardebil. where Brigadier-General Bayen- dor, without waiting for the arrival of the military tribunal, had convened a drum head court-martial and shot eight former Democrat supporters out of hand. Economic 12 . The formation of an Economic Council for Persia in April 1946 was reported in paragraph 9 of Intelligence Summary No. 13 of 1946. Very little was heard of this body or of its deliberations till December 1946, when it announced a seven-year plan for the economic develop ment of Persia. Upon scrutiny, this docu ment turned out to be no plan at all but merely a long-winded statement as to why no such plan had worked in the past, the main reasons being given as the inefficiency and corruption of Government employees and the almost complete lack of liaison between the different Ministries concerned. Subsequently, it became obvious that no such plan could work without considerable financial assistance from outside, and the question of a loan of 250 million dollars for thirty years from the World Bank was raised. As it was clear that no loan could, or would, be granted without full informa tion as to how the money was to be spent, a technical mission of Americans under the leadership of Mr. Dunn, vice-president of Morrison Knudsen, was engaged. This mission, which, it is rumoured, will be expanded to sixty members, is now busy on a survey of Persia. Their task has been rendered more difficult by the lack of any reliable statistics or, indeed, any statistics at all, relating to Persian economics. Appointments 13. Lieutenant-Colonel Samii has suc ceeded Colonel Sarimi as Military Governor of Abadan. The Court 14. Princess Ashraf has proceeded on a charitable mission to Astara. 15. Princess Shams is to return to Persia shortly accompanied by her husband and son. She was divorced from Feridun Jam, son of Mahmud Jam, Persian Ambas sador in Cairo, some four years ago and her subsequent marriage to an obscure and penniless young man of the name of Mimbashian, a grandson of a Cossack bandmaster, so displeased the Shah that she was deprived of her title. Her return, it is rumoured, is at the request of her mother, who disapproves of the publicity b 2 87-824 hunting, political opinions and behaviour of Princess Ashraf, and fears the influence which she is believed to wield over her twin brother, the Shah, and believes that the firmer character of Princess Shams will off set this influence. Russian Interests 16. The Press Section of the Soviet Embassy has published a denial of the truth of a statement which appeared in a Tehran newspaper about a fortnight ago. This statement was to the effect that M. Molotov, in an interview with Muzaffar Firuz, the Persian Ambassador in Moscow, had stated that he did not approve of the Deputies so far elected to the 15th Majlis. American Interests 17. The contracts of the American Military Mission to the Persian Army have been extended for two and a quarter years with effect from 20th December, 1946. Indian Affairs 18. A Persian delegation, headed by Ali Asghar Hikmat, is leaving shortly for India. It is to study political, cultural and economic questions affecting the two countries and to make suggestions for the improvement of relations in these three spheres. It will, incidentally, represent Persia at the Inter-Asian Relations Con ference which has been convened by the Indian Institute of World Affairs. Ali Asghar Hikmat, a former Minister of Education and a prominent scholar and writer, is president of the Persian branch of the Indo-Iranian Cultural Society and headed a cultural mission to India some two years ago.

The Chief of tho General Staff informed tho British Military Attache on 2nd March that tho Barzanis (see paragraph 3 of last Intelligence Summary) had made very slow progross in their return trek to Iraq and were still in the Gshnu and Naqado He attributed this delay to the largo number of their to an acute shortage of animal transport, to the deep snow lying on tho passes which they intended to use a_hd to tho uncertain outcome of negotiations with the Pushtdari Kurds of Iraq concerning a safe passage through or, possibly, an asylum in their landsV The Chief of tho General Staff denied tho truth of newspaper reports of' clashes bc-twoon the Barzanis and the P rsian forces.

Nasir Khan Qashgai informed the British Military Attache at a private mooting that whereas he had found the Prime (D.2) Minister reasonable and sympathetic over his requests for economic and other reforms in Pars and over'the reasons which had led him to start his revolt of last autumn, he had found the Minister for War intractable and disinclined to agree to anything without complete disarmament as a necessary preliminary. Nasir Khan showed his usual mistrust of the Shah and of '’his Army” and predicted gloomily that all these purchases of war material could be for no other purpose than that cf waging war against the tribes.

Approximately 5 million dollars for Gendarnorio noods v/as included in this. Ton millions are to bo expended on combat equipment, twenty millions on clothing, stores and M*T. and ton millions are estimated as necessary for its packing, freight and delivery. The same source reports that the Prime Minis ter is opposed to the whole scheme as a waste of money which could bo spent more profitably on economic dovelopmon or social services and also because ho fears that this added strength will but encourage the Mhah and his army to a further trial of strength between than and him.

Internal Security Kurdistan 2. According to information given to the British Military Attache by the Chief of the General Staff on 8 th March, the dis arming operations against the branch of the Herki under Zero Beg are temporarily delayed by the presence of the Barzanis on the Morgawar Plain (see paragraph below). The Persian Army columns are now located as follows :— (i) Baranduz Chai : J-38 O-B 5437. (ii) Sangar : J-38 P-B 6742. (iii) Khanliar : J-38 P-B 7003 (to join column (ii)). (iv) Jildian : J-38 V-G 6883 (to move to Ushnuiyeh). (v) Khaneh: J-38 V-G 6663 (a sta tionary garrison). These columns have, thus, a dual role, firstly to prevent the Barzanis doubling on their tracks or heading in any direction other than the one in which they are now going and, secondly, of containing the Herki until the departure of the Barzanis will permit of the resumption of the operations without risk of the Barzanis or other Persian Kurdish tribes (e.g.&lt; the Shakkak or Jalali) from joining in the fray. 3. According to the Chief of the General Staff the main body of the Barzanis has now reached the Mergawar Plain (about 50 miles in length running, roughly, north and south midway between the Turco- ,Persian frontier and Lake Urumiyeh). From the direction of their movement and from sundry other reports the Chief of the General Staff thinks that they intend to cross the frontier into Turkey first before making for Iraq and he stated that this was the route they had followed when they entered Persia nearly three years ago after their defeat at the hands of the Iraqi Army. In the opinion of the Chief of the General Staff another month will elapse before the snow on the high passes will melt sufficiently to let them cross. Mazanderan 4. Military government has been lifted from Chalus, Shahi and Sari. Bakhtiari 5. The Chief of the General Staff in formed the British Military Attache on 8 th March that a band of Abul Qasim’s men had recently attacked the village of Katwand near Sari-Dasht, about 30 miles north-east of Dizful. The G.O.C. Khuzi- stan Division had been instructed to send out a column to drive off the robbers. The Chief of the General Staff sharply criti cised the Government's policy in appointing as Governor of Bakhtiari such a rogue as Abul Qasim and Muzaffar Firuz, in particular, for having procured, against the advice of the General Staff, a gift of 1,000 rifles for this unprincipled adventurer. Kerman 6 . His Majesty’s Consul at Kerman, while returning from Yezd by road, was held up by armed highwaymen near Rafsinjan on 28th February and robbed of his personal belongings. Khuzistan 7. On 27th February two employees of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and a British journalist (Richard Wyndham, of the News of the World) were held up by tribal robbers near Gach Saran and relieved of their money, clothes and bedding. They 101-52 JU were subsequently allowed to proceed in their car to Gach Saran. The assailants are believed to be Boir Ahmedis. The Persian Army 8 . Paragraph 16 of Intelligence Summary No. 2 of 1946 mentioned the setting up of a military court to try Brigadier-General Darakhshani, who was commanding the I abriz garrison at the time of its sur render to the Azerbaijan rebels in Novem ber 1945. No trial actually took place, ihe press now reports the convening of a fresh court for the same purpose. 9. There are some welcome signs that the American military mission, under Briga dier-General Grow, is extending its activi ties beyond the very limited scope which General Ridley had laid down. On the invitation of the Chief of the General Staff a course of lectures at the Staff College is to be given by American officers. At the suggestion of the Minister for War the mission is interesting itself in Persian military finance. In this field of enquiry it should not have a dull moment. 10 . About a month ago three German prisoners of war escaped from a camp in the Caucasus and, having crossed the Aras River and the Moghan steppe, arrived at Ardebil where they surrendered to the Persian military forces. Soon after their arrival at Ardebil the Russian frontier authorities notified the Persian frontier gendarmerie of their escape, but no formal demand was made for their extradition either by the frontier authorities or in Tehran. They were interrogated by the Persian General Staff and subsequently, by the courtesy of the Chief of the General Staff by the American and British Military Attaches. The Chief of the General Staff states that the Ministry for Foreign Affairs has decided to set them at liberty. The Court 11 . In paragraph 5 of Intelligence Sum mary No. 5, current reference was made to press articles on the subject of the re interment of Reza Shah's remains in Persia. According to the Minister for War, the question has been under discus sion in the Cabinet more or less ever since. The Prime Minister, from the outset, was opposed to the plan, saying that the return of the body would arouse much latent oppo sition to the dynasty. High words had passed between the Prime Minister and the Shah, who said that this was an insult to his dead father which he could not brook. Several complications have arisen. Accord ing to a Shi’ah custom a body which has been buried in a non-Shi’ah country should, if brought back to Persia for re-interment, lie in the precincts of an Imamzadeh. Meshed, the shrine of the eighth Imam, was turned down as soon as mooted by the Shah on the score that the ullema of that place would certainly refuse burial to the body of a man who had machine-gunned the shrj^® in 1936. Qum, the shrine of Fatima, the eighth Imam's sister, was opposed on the grounds that Reza Shah had insulted the custodians by entering the shrine with his boots on and by clubbing to death a mullah who had upbraided the Queen for removing her veil. Yet a further difficulty is said to lie in the attitude of the Egyptian Govern ment, who, piqued by the Shah's failure to regularise his matrimonial affairs with Queen Fauzieh, have refused to provide fitting reception and ceremonies for the mission which was to come to Egypt to remove the body. Labour 12. The following paragraph has been contributed by the Labour Attache to His Majesty's Embassy :— ' The Tudeh trade union movement, which, twelve months ago, claimed 300,000 members, held a monopoly position as representing workers, intimidated em ployers and forced the Government into granting concessions, is now a very dim shadow of its former self. The Govern ment, which had been waiting an oppor tunity to attack the political and anti national activities of the Tudeh Party, used the successful conclusion of the Azerbaijan campaign as the occasion for organising trade unions under the aegis of the Prime Minister’s Democrat Party. There was continuous friction, with incidents of physical violence, between the members of the two rival trade unions, and throughout the country there were allegations by the Tudeh unions that their premises and clubs had been invaded and seized by the Democrat union. “ In November 1946 the Central Com mittee of the Tudeh trade unions, which had previously obtained recognition by the W.F.T.U., sent a telegram to the W.F.T.U. complaining of victimisation of members and suspension of the right of free associa tion. Request was made for a delegation from the W.F.T.U. to visit Persia to inves tigate conditions. The Persian Govern ment at first strongly opposed the request, but subsequently decided to welcome a delegation and grant it full facilities. Messrs. Borisoff (Russian), Malfettes (French) and Harries (British) arrived on3 25th February and were given a warm welcome by the Government. El Aris (Syrian), leader of the delegation, should have arrived the same day but failed to arrive. It is rumoured that he has been unable to obtain a transit visa for Iraq. A few days before the delegation arrived, to^orkers who claimed that they were mem bers of the reformed Tudeh Union (see paragraph 2 of Intelligence Summary No. 2 of 12 th January, 1947) invaded the union’s headquarters in Tehran and elected a new executive committee to exclude Reza Rusta and others whose sympathies were clearly extreme left and who had laid themselves open to charges of embezzling the party’s funds. The delegation has commenced work, interviewing representatives of the rival trade unions and visiting factories. Rusta has been in close association with Borisoff and has produced lengthy verbal and written statements to show the oppressive action of the Government. It was pro posed that the delegation should leave Tehran on 8 th March to visit Abadan and other industrial centres in the country, but Borisoff at the last moment refused to agree to the programme on the grounds that he had spoken to Moscow by telephone and received instructions from the leader of the Russian trade union movement to the effect that El Aris would shortly arrive in Tehran and no further action had to be taken in the meantime. This is the culminating point in what Harries feels is a deliberate delaying action. It had already become apparent that Borisoff was unwilling to express views on the delegation's work, interviews which had been held or the pro posed programme, until after he had paid his daily visit (on the plea of medical treat ment) to the Russian Embassy. The longer the delegation remains in Tehran the stronger becomes Rusta’s position, and it is the strong conviction of Harries that Rusta and Borisoff spend much time in discussions together at the Russian Embassy. ‘The Government’s position in the inves tigation has been somewhat strengthened by the fact that trade union regulations permitting the full and free association of workers and giving trade unions a status in law were approved by the Council of Ministers on 3rd March.” Note by the British Military Attache From the above no false deduction should be made to the effect that the Tudeh Party, either in its original or reformed state, is dead. It is working actively underground in Abadan and in Tehran it is biding its time hoping, not unreasonably, that the general dissatisfaction with the existing state of affairs will pave the way for its return. A deterioration in security, the continued high cost of living, the Govern ment’s apathy in measures of economic, educational and health reform, the in creasing unemployment, the Prime Minister’s conduct of the elections, the universal corruption practised by a horde of unnecessary officials (either from a natural bent for peculation or from inade quacy of their emoluments) are all grist to the Tudeh mill.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT SECRET PERSIA March 27, 1947 Section 1 E 2656/17/34 Copy No PERSIA: MILITARY ATTACHE’S INTELLIGENCE SUMMARY No. 10 Period 10th-17th March, 1947 {Communicated in Tehran Despatch No. Persian Affairs Political There has been very little news to chronicle during the past week, and to an observer who were to cast a superficial glance at Persia it might well appear that seldom of recent years has the country been in such a tranquil state. Such an observer might adduce in proof that the elections, save in Azerbaijan, Ears and a few other constituencies, have been completed with out disorder, and have resulted in an over whelming and seemingly popular victory for the party led by the Prime Minister. The Tudeh Party is in eclipse. The Russians appear to be behaving well and waiting with exemplary patience for the convening of the Majlis to learn the fate of their oil concession Bill. The Persian tribes are quiet. Those uninvited and turbulent guests, the Barzanis, are in process of leaving. Disarmament opera tions in Kurdistan are progressing, if slowly. The papers are full of the enthusiasm with which the Azerbaijanis have acclaimed the resumption of authority by the Central Government. The press is equally full of references to sound labour legislation enacted by an enlightened and humane Government. Prospects of securing a large development loan from the World Bank are still bright. The army, ably commanded by its popular chief, the Shah, is outwardly in fine fettle and about to augment its equipment to the tune of 7 million pounds from an American credit. Except for the Soviet oil concession, there seems to be no major problem confronting Persia in her relations either with the Great Powers or with her neighbours, except, perhaps, with Egypt over which the Shah’s matrimonial relations with his Queen have cast a temporary cloud. If the same observer, however, were to put his ear to the ground he might detect some subterranean rumblings which indicate a general dissatisfaction^with the existing 89 of l&amp;th March ; Received 21th March) state of affairs. The cost of living is inordinately high, and for no valid '^economic reason. A handful of notorious racketeers are rapidly enriching themselves while the rest of the population are. according to their class, environment and opportunities, either starving, taking to a life of crime, peculating on a scale hitherto unknown even in Persia, living on their capital or. having realised their immov able property, leaving the country. The sweeping success of the Prime Minister’s party at the polls may yet turn out to be a Pyrrhic victory, since, firstly, by insisting on an absolute majority and by excluding totally any representation by any other party he has needlessly antagonised a great many people, and. secondly, not even such an astute politician as he is can hope to maintain for long in a state of discipline and cohesion a heterogeneous band of egoistic and dissident adventurers, who care not under whose banner they enter the Majlis as long as tjiey get inside. The Tudeh are by no means dead, and the inefficiency and corruption of the Adminis tration will provide them with ample ammunition for their future activities. In the army, behind its tinsel and bunting, there are cross-currents of mistrust which are eating away the foundations of discipline. The Shah mistrusts the Minister of War. The Minister of War- mistrusts the Chief of the General Staff. The Shah’s military adviser, General Yazdanpanah, mistrusts both. The tribes present a major problem which the Govern ment not only has not tried to solve but which it seems to ignore. Disarmament is only one step in this direction, and even this is likely to be only in token form. In Azerbaijan, as has been mentioned pre viously, the Government’s slowness in re-erecting the administrative machine is arousing adverse criticism from the inhabi tants, who have already begun to compare the present regime to the recent one. Some labour legislation has been enacted, but. 101-522 here too, according to popular belief, the Government is trying to gain control of the trade union movement by bringing it under the influence of its own Iran Demo crat Party. In the domain of public health and education little constructive work is being done. The Government seems loath to decentralise and to entrust any real authority for local government to the pro vincial councils, a sure sign of its lack of confidence in its own strength. Finally, an ominous sign, the Government is hyper sensitive to criticism in the Persian or foreign press. There is no need to take an alarmist view of the situation, but to many it appears that Qawan-us-Saltaneh has screwed down the safety valve and is sitting on it. The Elections 2 . The following further provincial results have come in :— Bijar and Garrus : Aurang. Lar (Pars) : Faramaizi (editor of Kaihan). 3. In Azerbaijan the elections are to take place between the 19th and 25th March. It is believed that the Shah and the Prime Minister have agreed to allow the elections to be free, and that Ali Mansur, the Governor-General, persuaded them to this course believing that local men of standing and influence would best serve the interests of the province. 4. For Fars it is believed that Nasir Khan Qashgai, during his recent visit, arranged with the Prime Minister for the election of himself and one of his brothers, probably Malik Mansur. Labour 5. On 22nd February the Persian Government passed a decree preventing the dismissal of surplus workers from any factory without the prior sanction of the Ministry of Labour. (The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company are excepted from this law.) Many factories, notably the Isfahan mills, have always been badly organised and now, for the first time, faced with competition from imported fabrics, are casting about for possible economies by the exercise of which the owners can still make the 100 per cent, profit regarded as a beggarly minimum by the average Persian business man. During the reign of terror of the Tudeh Party these owners were intimi dated into taking on to their payroll a large amount of extra labour. These surplus hands they are now trying to discharge. Qawam's Government, mindful of the weak foundation of temporary popularity on which they rest, do not wish for any aggravation of the unemployment problem with a resultant clamour for strong and immediate action by them to solve it. Hence the recent enactment. Internal Security Fars 6 . As the result of a conference attended by the Prime Minister, Minister of War, Chief of the General Staff, Governor- General of Fars and Nasir Qashgai in Tehran it has been decided, .according to Tehran radio, that the Qashgai will sur render one-third of the rifles in their possession when the tribe leaves for its summer quarters, and one-third when they start the downward migration to their winter quarters. The remaining third will be retained for the present provided that licences for these arms are obtained from the Government. This arrangement, in respect of the proportion to be retained, follows the agreement reached, according to the Chief of the General Staff, with the Kurds. Azerbaijan 7. His Majesty’s Consul-General reports that rumours are current in Tabriz to the effect that a large number of Caucasian immigrants have entered Azerbaijan sur reptitiously. These rumours have been repeated in the Tehran press during the past week. His Majesty’s Consul-General can find no evidence of their truth, and thinks that they may have been put about in order to create unrest and anxiety. Kurdistan 8 . The Chief of the General Staff informed the Iraqi Charge d’Affaires on 15th March that the main body of the Barzanis had now reached the village of Binar (J-38 O, B 3923) which is situated about five miles north-east of the junction of the Turkish, Iraqi and Persian frontiers. On 17th March the Minister of War, in the presence of the Chief of the General Staff, informed the British Military Attache that on 15th and 16th March, on the Tergawar plain (an exten sion northwards of the Mergawar plain), the Barzanis had turned upon the four Persian army columns to their north, north east, east and south (see paragraph 2 of last Intelligence Summary) and had started fighting. The Persian army’s casualties had, so far, amounted to an officer and six other ranks killed. The Barzanis, it was believed, had suffered more severely. Asked why the Barzanis had turned upon the Persian Government’s forces, the Minister3 of War replied that the latest information in his possession showed that the Barzanis regarded themselves as hunted fugitives against whom their own country, Iraq, had closed its gates, and that in desperation they had got into touch with the Russians some weeks ago through the Horki and Shakkak Kurds. In the Minister of War’s opinion they must have changed their course and decided to make for Russia, and, finding their way through the Rezaieh plain blocked by the Persian Government’s troops, they had attacked them. Bakhtiari 9. His Majesty’s Consul-General at Ahwaz reports that Abul Qasim Bakhtiari has sent an impertinent letter to the Governor-General which moved the latter to complain to Tehran of Abul Qasim’s insubordination. Abul Qasim was sum moned to Tehran, or, as the Persian press described it, has arrived in the capital for discussions with the Prime Minister. Despite the suspicions entertained of him by the General Staff and the detestation in which he is held by all the Bakhtiari Khans of both branches of the tribe, this rascal seems to enjoy the confidence of Qawam- us-Saltaneh. The Persian Army 10 . The Minister of War informed the British Military Attache on 17th March that the amount of the American credit had not yet been finally decided, but that it was hoped to fix it at 33 million dollars (see paragraph 11 of Intelligence Summary No. 8 ). If this sum were procured 10 million would be allotted for combat material and 10 million for non-combat equipment. Eight million were necessary for freight, packing and insurance. The remaining 5 million would be allotted to the gendarmerie. The purchasing mission is not proceeding at once but will await the final fixing of the sum. General Abdullah Hidayet, accompanied by another Persian officer and a member of the Ameri can military mission, were leaving at once to complete the negotiations. According to the Minister of War, if the money was forthcoming in the form of an interest- bearing loan, it could only be procured by Majlis sanction. Fearing hostile criticism of increased army expenditure (with every justification it may be added!), the army was reluctant to go to the Majlis and hence the negotiations for a credit instead of a loan. The Persian Ambassador in Wash ington had been unable to secure American acceptance of the terms under which the Persian Government proposed to pay, but it was hoped that General Hidayet would conclude a satisfactory bargain. 11 . The military tribunal convened to try Persian army officers charged with dereliction of duty at the time of the sur render of the Kazerun garrison in 1946 has acquitted all except a Colonel Yamani, who has been sentenced to imprisonment for life. 12 . General Hasan Arfa, the late Chief of the General Staff, has retired. The Persian Gendarmerie 13. The growing tension between the army and the gendarmerie has been men tioned more than once in these Intelligence Summaries. The American State Depart ment’s reluctance to supply large quanti ties of combat material to both forces has also been reported. The Persian Minister of Finance has now entered the fray by stating, in the plainest of language, that Persia neither requires nor can afford the luxury of two armies, and that their respec tive budgets, of approximately 12 and 6 million pounds, apart from supplementary credits, loans and other subterfuges for obtaining more money, are an excessive price to pay for the very inadequate degree of security which they at present provide. The immediate result of this protest, according to the Minister of WTar, has been the appointment of a commission, under the presidency of the Prime Minister, to examine the whole question. The Minister of War, the Chief of the General Staff and Brigadier-General Grow persuaded the Prime Minister to reduce the gendarmerie from its present strength of 23,000 to 15,000 by taking over the frontiers as an army responsibility (to include preventive services), and by relegating the gendar merie to road protection duties in the interior. General Schwarzkopf, who was planning for a total gendarmerie strength of 30,000, and who had ambitious plans for the creation of a truly national police force, agreed to this reduction, according to the Minister of War, with ill grace.

According to His Majesty’s Ambas sador at Bagdad a party of four French men, two self-styled members of the “ International Student Service ” and two journalists, recently entered Iraq in British military transport without com pleting the necessary formalities at the frontier. While in Iraq they appear to have contracted extreme Left-wing elements. The Iraqi Government has ordered them to leave the country. They state they are bound for Persia and Afghanistan, and left Bagdad for Kerman- shah on 13th March.*\Z~~ '■*L*J* / No.7^ 1.1/47, JJ .1 - ' r ‘ ; . ,♦ ^riitish Urnbaaay, .1' TEHRAN. 23rd March 1947.

A zerbaijan. 5, Re fore nee paragraph 7 of last Intelligence Summary an officer of the Persian General Staff Informed the British Military Attache on 21st March that the rumours of the arrival of Caucasian immigrants into Azerbaijan are not entirely devoid of truth. About 150 have entered Persia during the past ton days by the Julfa frontier. They were in possession of cither Persian or Russian passports with visas given by the Persian Consul at Baku which are suspected of being forgeries since that official, when asked why he had issued so many visas, replied to the effect that the number ho had granted was 'normal. Those immigrants are suspected of being recent supporters of the Azerbaijan Democrat regime who fled to Russia on its collapse and have now returned disillusioned by their treatment at the hands of their former supporters. They are being sent to Tehran and, after scroonihg, will be despatched to the Southern and Ban torn parts of Persia. They /appearappear to bo ponnllous, III-clad and half atarvod* Kurd j^an, 6 # The situation, as given to the British Military Attache by the Persian Chief of the General Staff on 21at March, was as follows:- Tho most Northerly of tho Persian Army columns hoard that the Barzania were still heading Northwards from tho TERGAWAR plain, i#c, further and further from tho Porso-Iraqi or Porso-Turkish frontier Thoy also received confirmation that the Barzanis had boon in touch with tho Russians both through tho Russian Consulate-Conoral Ih Tabriz and through tho Horki and hhakkak Kurds. It was a probability, therefore, that thoy'had changed thoir minds and v/cro now making for tho Russian frontier. To prevent this and also any junction between thorn and tho Kurds of tho Salmas, Tvhoi and Maku areas, this coTumn moved from REZAIEII via tho NAZLU CIIAI to MA7/ANA (J-38 0 , B 3862) where, on 16th March, it oncountcrod tho Barzanis. A at iff' skirmish ensued in which both sides lost about 50 killed and wounded. Tho'Barzania appear to have had, and made use of, three 76-?nm. Abukoff Mounts in”guns tho origin of which is still in doubt since tho Persians say they are not theirs but the Iraqis, while tho latter deny having mountain guns of this typo. Tho Barzanis rotroatod to SILWANA (J-38’0, 3 4245). Another Persian column is moving from REZAIEE Westwards along the BERDESUR CHAT in order to effect a junction with tho MAWANA column also moving South. When those join it is hoped to push tho Barzanis further South to tho IJSHNTjyiEII area (J-38 P, B 6402). A third c 6 litmn had, on 16th March, reached JAFRIAN on tho BARANDUZ CHAI (J-38 P, B 5840) and will join the other two. On tho same day on'which'tno MAWANA skirmish took place another group of tho Barzanis, ’ sullying out of USHNUYIEH, which important town was in thoir hands, attacked violently a small force of MANGUR and MAMISH tribes which had volun teered for service with tho Government troops. This affair took placo at SUFIAN {J-38 V, G 6988), This party of tho Barzanis also was in possess ion of throe 75-nm, Bofors mountain guns captured in 1945 from tho Persian Array. Casualties In this engagement are also said to number about fifty on each side. On 22nd March tho Chief of tho General Staff said that further fighting had occurred in both tho Northern and Southern sectors. The nearest Persian Army columns in the Southern sector are at KERNA (J-38 V, G 8389) and KHANHI (J-38 V, G 6663). Tho Per□ Ian' General Staff suggested that an Iraqi officer with a w/T sot ho sont as a liaison officer to tho lAraian forces - a vital stop if collaboration in frontier control is over to bo achieved between tho two countries and a step which tho British Military Attach^ has boon urging on tho Persian General Staff for'some yours. Tho offer was accepted but tho Persians failed to keep tho appointment at tho rendezvous.

The Shah’s speech was brief and followed the conventional pattern of exhortation to effort. That of the Prime Minister, on the other hand, lasted two hours and outlined a seven-year plan designed to effect the total regeneration of Persia. The plan was worked out in con siderable detail and covered every aspect of the life of the country. Total estimated expenditure involved is nearly 60,000 million rials, i.e., about £450 million or the equivalent of some 14 years annual ordinary revenue on the present basis. Some of the major items are as follows :— Million rials Health Services ... ... 17,305 Education ... ... ... 11,500 Railways ... ... ... 6,905 Army and Security Services 6,000 Housing ... ... ... 5,130 Industry ... ... ... 3,505 Irrigation ... ... ... 3,300 The Prime Minister said that heavy as the cost of his plan was, it was the minimum needed to ensure to this country her right ful place among the nations. All the money required could not be expected to come from foreign sources. Indeed, the larger part of it should come from the national capital. It was the duty of every one to hdp. There was no reference to the much discussed request for a loan from the International Bank or to any other foreign loan, nor was any specific amount men tioned. The broadcast ended with a few anodyne general remarks on foreign and domestic policy in which the Prime Minister emphasised his determination to resist all forms of interference from with out and to enforce an honest and vigorous policy at home. Internal Security A zerbaijan 2. The elections have started, but His Britannic Majesty’s Consul reports that the populace are displaying little active interest as they generally are disgusted at the way in which votes are being purchased. 3. The Chaldean Catholic Archbishop of Urumieh has expressed his apprehension in regard to the welfare of Christians of all sects in Western Azerbaijan, who are being persecuted by the Muslim population, he says, as a consequence of the former association of certain members of the com munity with the Azerbaijan Democrats. The 'Divisional Commander, on being approached about the matter, said that he had heard nothing of it and undertook to wire his colleague in the area asking him to stop without delay any direct action by Muslims against Christians. It has been difficult to ascertain how accurate is the complaint of the Archbishop or how much it may be exaggerated. 4. Reference paragraph 11 of last week’s Intelligence Summary. Local authorities have ordered the immigrants to prepare to move to Tehran prior to dis persal in southern areas of the country, and estimate that about 4,060 people are affected by this order. The immigrants protested to the Russian Consul-General, who informed them that, as they were Persian subjects, the matter was no concern of his. Kurdistan 5. The situation, as given to the Assis tant British Military Attache on 29th March by the Persian Chief of the General Staff, was as follows (reference J-inch maps J-38, O.P.U.V.) :— (a) In the northern sector, after counter attacking in the earlier part of the week, the Barzanis have been driven further south from Silvana (B 4245) through the Mergawa plain. The three Persian columns advancing through Mawana (B 3862), down the Berdeshur Chai ac^2 through Jafrian (B 5840) have now joined up as planned. A semi-continuous front is now as follows : from Razga (B 4535) through Nergi (B 4835) in the Mergawar plain to Mamkan (B 5436) and the general area of square B 63. This northern column is under the command of Sartip Faramarz Aslani. (b) In the southern sector, the columns based on Naqadeh (G 9094) under the com mand of Sartip Nadir Quli Beglari are operating as follows : Positions have been established at the northern end of the flank at Nanas (B 7919) and point 7064 (B 7822). On the 29th itself units operating west wards from Haidarabad (B 90) were attacking the hill feature point 7756 (B 7711) to point 7605 (B 7606). On the 28th another column, moving along the Naqadeh-Ushnuiyeh road, had driven the Barzanis out of the area of Ting contour 5361 (G 7999). On the extreme south the columns based on Kerna (G 8389) and Khaneh (G 6663) have occupied Shilla Darreh (G 7593), Jildian (G 6884) and Sufian (G 6988). (c) In these operations troops have been receiving close support from Hind aircraft operating from a temporary strip cleared for the purpose at Rezaiyeh, and this is said to have had a great effect on the morale of the Barzanis. (d) The Chief of the General Staff said that operations are progressing satisfac torily, but that, owing to the difficult nature of the country and to the necessity of adequate consolidation, he did not expect operations to be concluded for at least a month. The Barzanis are being hard pressed, he said, and the advances of the army had robbed them of their main sources of supply. The main object of the operations was now to drive them out of the country by the Gedar Chai (B 5300) and thence over the Berde Buk Pass into Iraq. With this aim in view the com mander of the southern sector had orders not to close this route to them. At least one gun that is in the possession of the Barzanis has been knocked out, but their artillery is still giving trouble as it is under the direction of Major Izzat Aziz, an Iraqi artillery officer of Kurdish descent who has joined the tribes. Quoting figures, the Chief of the General Staff stated that the losses to date had been, among Persian troops, 5 officers and 30 other ranks killed, and, among the Barzanis, about 100 killed. Fars 6. It is learned from His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz, that Naser Khan % Qashgai, who recently visited Tehran, has received a gift of 5 million rials ffrom the Shah for ‘ ‘ agricultural development ’ ’ in Abadeh and Firuzabad. 7. Fathullah Khan Hayat Baud has also visited Tehran and appears satisfied with the results of his meetings with the Sh^^j and military and civil leaders. How^cr^ he appears to have fallen out with Naser Khan, for he told His Britannic Majesty’s Consul that Naser had betrayed the true interests of Fars and the Qashgai to the Prime Minister in order to buy his own protection against the army. He also expressed doubts of Naser’s ability to get back from his own tribesmen the arms promised for return to the army. The Chief of the General Staff, in conversation with the Assistant British Military Attache, expressed his awareness of the fact that little reliance could be placed on the promises of Naser and said that the army were ready to take strong action if he failed to keep his word. He further stated that full plans had been made for the re-establishment of the military garrisons lost during the Qashgai revolt. Bakhtiari 8. Reference paragraph 9 of Intelligence Summary No. 10, dated 10th March. Abul Qasim had completed his discussions in Tehran by 22nd March and had returned to the south. Agha Khan Bakhtiari, his cousin and the new Deputy for Shahreza, stated that Abul Qasim had successfully dealt with complaints made against him and that he had once more ingratiated him self with the Prime Minister and the Chief of the General Staff. He has endeavoured to do the same with His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General, Ahwaz, whom he made a victim of his nefarious intrigues with Muzaffar Firuz (see Intelligence Summary No. 37, dated 22nd September, 1946). Meanwhile, the Government appointed “ Kalantars ” of the tribe are , complaining of Abul Qasim’s oppression and demanding his removal. He is expected to return to Tehran in about two weeks’ time. The Persian Army 9. A list of the officers promoted to the ranks of Sartip and Sarlashgar is given as an appendix to this summary. In addi tion to these promotions the following retired officers have been recalled to the active list :— Sipahbud Muhammad Shahbakhti (M A 38/262; F.O. 46/159).3 Sarlashgar Ahmad Agha Muini (M.A. 38/174; F.O. 44/140). Sarlashgar Iraj Matbui (M.A. 38/167). For the appointments they assume see paragraph 13. ^10- The Chief of the General Staff the area of the Barzani operations during the week. On his return he stated that the purpose of his visit had been to ascertain how far morale had been affected by the casualties incurred to date. He said that he found it high and he was most satis fied that officers and men were getting the battle experience which they needed in order to make them more proficient in their profession. The Persian Police 11. A series of decorations for the Police Force have been instituted and a long list of first recipients of awards at the Persian New Year (22nd March) has been announced. The decorations are as follows :— (a) The Order of Splendour (Nishan-i- Darakhsh), 3 classes, awarded to officers of the police in 'recognition of distinguished services rendered to the force. (b) The Police Order (Nishan-i-Pas), 3 classes, awarded to officers of the police for meritorious service and also to civilians who render out standing assistance to the police in the execution of their duty. (c) The Police Medal (Medal-i-Pas), as for (b) but awarded to other ranks of the police. (d) The Medal of Endeavour (Medal-i- Talash), 3 classes, awarded in recog nition of exemplary service to other ranks of the police. (e) Retired officers badge (Nishan-i-Baz- nishastigi). Awarded on retire ment to all officers for wear on the lapel of civilian clothes. The wearing of it is not obligatory. 12. Three police colonels have been pro moted to the rank of brigadier. It is understood that the Shah at first refused to sanction these promotions on the grounds that the Police Force only required one brigadier, but that he was afterwards over-persuaded by the Prime Minister and others. There are now five brigadiers in the force. Appointments: Military 13. {a) Sartip Abdul Husain Hejazi to be commander of the 7th (Kerman) Divi sion vice Sartip Ghulam Ali Qadar relieved. (b) Sartip Ahmad Vossuq to be head of the 3rd Bureau of the General Staff vice Sartip Hejazi. (c) Sipahbud Muhammad Shahbakhti to be Inspector of the Forces in Azerbaijan. (d) Sarlashgar Ahmad Agha Muini to be commander of the 6th (Fars) Division vice Sartip Saifullah Himmat, who remains as second-in-command. (e) Sarlashgar Iraj Matbui to be an inspector in the Ministry for War. Note. —(i) The Persian Chief of the General Staff stated that Qadar had been relieved as he was suffering from heart trouble; but there have been persistent reports of his extreme cor ruptness and from May 1945 to June 1946 he was held on the semi-retired list for this failing; and it was under stood that he was being now relieved for the same reason. (ii) The Chief of the General Staff stated that, although Himmat is an excellent officer with a thorough knowledge of the tribes of Fars, he lacks the personality to make a good commander (this in spite of the fact that he has been first a brigade com mander in the area and then divisional commander continuously since June 1942). He remains as second-in-com mand to give Muini the benefit of his local knowledge. Labour 14. The W.F.T.U. Delegation without the British member, Mr. Harries, who had visited the area prior to the arrival of the remainder of the party, visited Abadan, Agha Jari, Masjid-i-Suleiman and Bandar Mashur between 22nd and 29th March. Having previously agreed with the Minis ter of Labour that the delegation would travel without Tudeh escort, the President, El Aris, changed his mind at the last moment and insisted that Jodat and Nataki should accompany the delegation as “ interpreters.” The Governor-General, Khuzistan, tried unsuccessfully to persuade the Government to ban the entry into the south of Jodat and Nataki on the grounds that they had been so closely involved with the agitation and disorders of summer 1946 that their presence might revive disorder. The Governor-General kept close watch on the delegation’s activities in Abadan, and following statements made by Nataki to groups of workers to the effect that they should not be discouraged as the Tudeh was far from finished and was going to return in full strength, and in which he warned workers to have nothing to do withthe new Oil Workers’* Union, the Governor- General informed Nataki and Jodat that they had outstayed their welcome in Abadan. They returned to .Tehran on 24th March, leaving the delegation to con tinue its tour of Khuzistan and to return to Tehran on Monday, 31st March, having spent two days in-Isfahan.

PERSIA: MILITARY ATTACHE’S INTELLIGENCE SUMMARY No. 160 13 Period 31st March-7th April, 1947 (Communicated in Tehran Despatch No. 113 of 9th April; Received \§th April) Persian Affairs Political Rumours of a split in the Cabinet persist (see paragraph 1 of Intelligence Summary No. 11) and it is generally believed that the Prime Minister intends to make some ministerial changes. It is nothing so straightforward as a direct cleavage between cc reactionaries ” and “ progres sives ” as at first thought but a welter of personal jealousies, intrigues and quarrels over the distribution of the fruits of office. One Persian, commenting on this, stressed the unrivalled capacity of his countrymen for dissidence and dissolution and, when asked into how many groups the thirteen Cabinet Ministers were now divided, jokingly alluded to a well-known tradition of Muhammad’s prophesying the number of sects into which Islam would be split after his death and replied “ seventy-two.” 2. The Persian Ambassador in Moscow informed a press delegation that Persia Avas preparing a claim for reparations from Germany which would amount to approxi mately 250 million pounds sterling. A large part of this sum was due to the Iranian State Railway for having trans ported Aid-to-Russia material. This sum, the Persian Ambassador was at pains to point out, did not by any means cover Persia’s total war losses which, in propor tion to her total resources, had been heavier than those sustained by any other nation. The Ambassador did not mention that his Government has already claimed a sum of about £12 million from the Allies for the Iranian State Railway under the headings of freight, profit and depreciation. The Elections 3. The following provincial results have •come in —• Behbehan : Sultan Ali Sultani (also in the 13th and 14th Majlises for this constituency). Sari: Manuchihr Gulbadi; Sharifzadeh. Abadeh : Muhammad Husein Qashgai. Internal Security Pars 4. His Majesty’s Acting-Consul at Shiraz reports that the Governor-General and some other officials are displeased with the replacement of Sartip Himmat by Sarlashgar Muini (see paragraph 13 of last Intelligence Summary) as G.O.C. 6th (Pars) Division. Sartip Himmat is an old South Persian Rifles officer with a well-deserved reputation for honesty. His long career in Ears has given him a wide knowledge of tribes whom he treats firmly but kindly. 5. Khosro Khan Qashgai shares the opinions of Fathullah Hayat Daudi reported in paragraph 7 of last Intelligence Summary and heartily disapproves of the list of candidates for election to the Majlis from Ears which Nasir Khan drew up with the Prime Minister on his recent visit to Tehran and is accusing his eldest brother of having sold Ears and the Qashgai in order to further his own interests. He is trying to persuade the Governor-General to postpone the elections but this astute official, though willing enough to take bribes from both parties to the dispute, is unlikely to risk the Prime Minister’s dis pleasure either by upsetting the arrange ments already made or by delaying their completion. 6. The O.C. Gendarmerie in Ears informed the British Military Attache while in Shiraz that he had re-established his gendarmerie posts on the Shiraz- Bushire road as far as Kazerun but that the remaining portion was far from safe, each petty chieftain or village headman having posted his own armed retainers nominally to maintain security but in reality to levy toll on all passing traffic. Clashes between these musketmen at the junctions of their “ spheres of influence ” were of frequent occurrence. A zerhaijan 7. His Majesty’s Consul-General at Tabriz reports a further extension of the polling period. Local rumour gives as the 101-104reason the insufficiency of votes so far polled by the candidates nominated by the Government. 8. Ali Mansur, the Governor-General, according to the same source, is very displeased at the appointment of Sipahbud Shahbakhti as G.O.C.-in-C. of the Western Forces and, fearing interference in his sphere by so high-ranking an officer, is meditating resignation. Kurdistan 9. Qazi Muhammad, Sadr Qazi his brother, the ex-Deputy, and Saif Qazi hifc cousin, were all executed in Mahabad on 31st March (see paragraph 5 of Intelligence Summary No. 4). 10. The Chief of the General Staff gave the British Military Attache on 7th April the following situation regarding the Barzani operations :— During the past week comparatively heavy fighting has been in progress both in the Mergawar plain and around Ushnuyieh which the Persian army cap tured on 5th April. The total casualties of the Persian army in both sectors to date are fifteen officers and seventy-five other ranks killed and about three times that number wounded. Two officers and fifteen other ranks of the Fauzieh Cavalry Regi ment captured in the northern sector and three officers and thirty-five other ranks captured in the southern sector have been released by the Barzanis. After the capture of Ushnuyieh and an intensifica tion of air action the Barzanis retreated westwards from both sectors and joined up near Qaleh Zeva (J-38 P, B 4825). On 6th April they were last seen heading for Iraq and a few miles from the border at the Berde Buk Pass (J-38 P, B 4303). On that day they had sent a message to the Persian commander requesting cessation of air action in return for which they would hand over all their artillery (believed six mountain guns), the Iraqi army officer deserters would accept Persian nationality, the Armenian contingent would be dis missed and the Persian army deserter officers and men would be handed over. This request was ignored. The Chief of the General Staff is of the opinion that the Barzanis will not stand and fight again in Persia but will cross the border into Iraq. Economic 11. The Persian Government, by a Cabinet decree, has brought into force again the law of 1935 prohibiting the sale or purchase of foreign exchange except by permit and through an authorised bank. British Interests 12. It is believed that the firm of Sir Alexander Gibb &amp; Partners will secure the contract for the Kuhrang dam near Isfahan. This project was originally made in the reign of Shah Abbas and aimed at tunnelling through a watershed in order to divert part of the waters of the Karun river into the Zayendehrud river which flows past Isfahan.

PERSIAN AFFAIRS. Political. ^ In the political field there hs.s been nothing of interest to report during the past week. In connection with the rumoured ministerial ohanges names of an&lt; ^ replacements are new beginning to be heard. It is said that the Shah is loath to give the Prime I inis ter written authority to effect the changes tiH he knows the naijres of those whom it is proposed to exclude and include. There are still no indications that the Majlis will be convened in the immediate future. There.has been some criticism in the Persian press of the proposed loan from the International.Banko In general, the l 3 ft wing papers oppose it on the grounds that America will secure an economi- stranglehold on Persia while other papers predict gloomily that the money will net be spent on projects c*f benefit but will merely swell the profits of the racketeers. The Prime Minister may have been influenced by these criticisms. He may have realized that, in any case, the International Bmk does not possess the fifty million pounds which the seven year lanneis say they require. Be the reason what it may it is obvious that the Persian vernment is casting about for possible alternative sources of money. Their m aosa 01 in Moscow is ? present a modest bill for Genr.ui reparations for 250 million sterling. it is known that the Persian Government are keen to re-oben StltlTAZl yj h l B S^ Bh f0r a . sett “ — ti*. claims of th/fSanian . 0 C, {’ Yet anOohex source is apparently to be explored, according to the C an ca the - lnin g * Industrial Bank, who informed H.M's Ambassador that the froT^^r r ^ nt 13 ° 0 « sia ^in G tire possibility of a foreign lean to be' secured to fill theEnr ^ 8 paid , thD Anglo-Ira nan Oil Company.

Aerial bombardment of the BAIiZANTS will continue in the valley of GARDERI KICHKA (B 40).

PERSIAN- ARMY. The Minister for War has left Tehran on a tour of inspection of the Isfahan and Shiraz garrisons. THE PERSIAN NAVY. Referenf^e para 10 of Intelligence Sisamary JT 0.3 current, nothing has been heard of the results of the conversations in London between the Admiralty and the two Persian naval officers concerning the future of the Persian Navy. When questioned by the British Military Attache some three weeks ago, the Persian Chief of the General otaff replied that permission to stay in the U.K. for another month had been granted i;o the two officers for whom, according to their own statement, various visits to naval installations had been arranged. ? c ^ A salvage party of an officer and 1 6 ratings of the Royal Navy has arrived in Abadan. Their efforts to raise the Persian Navy gun boat 'PAIANG' (which was sunk at one of the A.I.O.C’s oil jetties by the Royal-Navy when British Military forces entered Persia in 1941) have so far proved unsuccessful as the vessel is lying on her sado. The salvage party now hope to tow the vessel down stream and beach her. This jee was undertaken at the request of the A. I.CyO. as the 'Palang f was an obstruction. The Persian Government have reguest eft that, on completion of the 'Palang' job, the salvage party will undertake the raising of the ’HOMAN (ex-Sheikh of Muhammerah's steam yacht 'PVT') used as a depot ship by the Persian Nr y which, disintegrating from ole age, sank in the Karun river last year after being handed back to the Persian Navy, a.hcy also request that the salvage party will .try to raise their other gun boat of the 'Palang's' type, the 'BABR 1 , which was sunk in the Karun river half a mile above the HGMiN by the British in 1941. Neither the ’HomrN nor the »Babr» constitute an obstruction to shipping in their present positions# According to^an official of the A.1.0,0. recently on a visit to Tehran the Company has been helping the Persian Navy to a considerable extent in refitting in tnoir dry dock one of the throe smaller gun boats recently returned by the Royal Indian Tvavy, On completion of the refit the, gunboat made a trial trip to Bushire. Nothing was heard from her for throe days and to allay the consternation caused in Persian /navalnaval circles the A.I.O.C. despatched a tug in sear anchor off Bushire the Captain having forgotten to arr^^Ml. (Thus does Haji Baba put to seal) v/as located at notify his safe LABOUR. 11. The W.P.T.U. delegation returned to Tehran on 7th April after visiting various factories in Mazanderan and the Russian Fisheries at Pahlevi. During the tour it became clear to Mi* Harries, the British Delegate, that HL ARIS is merely a figurehead as President and that little effort is made to conceal the fact that he takes his orders from M.Borisov, the Russian delegate* Despite Mr Harries’ protests the delegation only interviewed Tudeh party members or persons with a grievance against the Persian Government and, at Shahi, refused to receive a deputation from a crowd of six hundred persons who had assembled to testify to the excesses committed by the local Tudeh Trade Union when in pov/er. At Pahlevi the programme for the delegation was so arranged that their entire time was taken up by an impressive reception in the house of the Russian Manager of the Fisheries and they were given no opportunity for private discussions with the workers,for hearing complaints pr fo9 \ inspecting houses and welfare amenities. At Shahi HL ARIS alone visited the prison and talked with some hundred and tv/enty inmates who head been convicted of attacking and disarming Persian Military outposts last September. El Aris boasted of having served a five year term of imprisonment and promised that he would, on his return to Tehran, intervene with the Prime Minister to secure their release. These activities have led the Persian Ministry of Labour Representative attending on the delegation to make a formal protest against this misuse of his privileges by El Aris. C 01 'l.DN IC AT IONS. 12* The Persian Government intend to reopen landline telegraph communication with India via Zahedan in the near future and the automatic morse equipment now used to work Bushire will be utilized for the Zahedan circuit.

Under these circumstances the Bushire station of Messrs Cable &amp; Wireless Ltd., will decline in importance.yv ] o - 2 - A ? em&lt; ^ ial sorvioe, attended by II. I. U.

In the light of this there is an air of probability about a further story to the effect that the Russians are busy in buying the deputies most suspected of opposition to the proposed concesoion- 2.

According Lo hie Minister of War, he .ever ; a las - '* minute hitch has occurred in the form of r*newed opposition to reinterment i Meshed by the clergy in Meshed and, urged thereto by them, from the merchants of the Tehran bazaar. INTERNAL SECURITY. Kurdistan. 3* The situation regarding the Barzanis is as follows. The Iraqi Government lurectorate of Prop ganda anne meed on 19th April that up to that date 1930 Barzaj 1 men including Sheibh Ahmad, the religious leader of the tribe, 1686 women and 132 ° ph^ldren had sur.’cndered and had boon sent to reception areas. The number of Iraqi/oil icers who deserted to Mulla Mustafa was twelve of whom tv/o are now under arre in Baghdad. The Persian Chief of the General Staff informed the British Military Attache on 23rd April that he believed all the Barzanis to have left Persia. He did not knov# how many had surrendered to the Iraqi Government but was suprised at the smallness of the ffiguros quoted above as his information put the total strength of the tribe at four times that figu: j and he could only surmise that the remainder had e i trier perished in the blizzard of the I4th/l3th April or had not yet made contact with the Irr.qi authorities. His information was that Mulla Mustafa, with 300 armed retainers, si Persian Army deserter officers and the Iraqi Army deserter officers had left Persia heading for Barz&amp;n on 18th April. One Iraqi deserter officer had be n captured in the recent fighting and two Iraqi deserter NoC.Os had surrendered. They wore being brought to Tehran for interrogation. From His Majesty's Embassy, Baghdad comes a variant of this report giving the number of Mulla Mustafa's retainers as two hundred, his present whereabouts as ARGOSH, N.N.E. of Barzan. nus his situation as beiwg penned by the Iraqi forces with whom the Turkish force, are collaborating. Unless-therefo: e, ho succoedsin breaking back into Persia the 1 .rzavi affair ; :s so fur as it affoots Persia, would appear to bo finished. / 1/10 Now that those unv/elcome guests, the Barzanis, have taken their leave th^Persian Army can get on with its task of disarming Persian Turdistan with the Herid. as their first target. Aheir leader, Zero Beg, is still resisting near the Iraq border and is reported by His Majesty’s Consul-General at Tabriz as saying that he will only surrender on an amnesty being granted by the Bhah. The Persian Chief of the General Staff explained to the British Military Attache his plan and the sub division of the I.urdish tribal areas into ten military districts each in charge of a colonel. The Chief of the General Staff stressed the need for striking while the iron was h^t^and said that the casualties inflicted on the Barzanis and the vigour with which the derations had been carried out had impressed the Persian Hurd; provided no time was lost, ho did not anticipate any severe object.

General Grow advised that the Administrativa Depots located at Headquarters of Divisions should be taken out of the control of Divisional Commanders and be placed under th~ direct control of the Intendance Branch of the Ministry of War to which, and not to the General Staff, General Grow's mission is attached. At first sight this would appear to be a sensible suggestion and a procedure, moreover, which follows American military administration. General Razmara, the Chief of the General Staff, opposed this plan violently, seeing in its adoption a lessening of his authority and a diminution in his profits, Divisional Commanders being under the control of the General Staff. The Shah sided with the Chief of the General Staff and the Minister of War at an audience of the Shah tendered his resignation on the ground that his position would be impossible if powers of administrative spending were to be delegated to the General Staff while he, as a cabinet minister, were still to remain responsible to the Majlis for the conduct of the Army's business. A commission to discuss the dispute is to meet shortly. LABOUR. 6 .

During the past week correspondents in Tehran have been sending reports to London newspapers which suggested that serious trouble was being caused in Azer baijan by terrorist bands and immigrants from Soviet territory. Neither report was true. Some 300 people who had been thrown into prison by the populace as suspected of sympathy with the Democrat regime between the collapse of that move ment and the re-entry of the Government forces have recently been liberated and sent to Tehran. The number of immigrants who have arrived in Persia in ones and twos after escaping from Soviet territory has, according to the Chief of the General Staff been, at the most, 200 during the past six months. These also are under close observation. In answer to foreign corres pondents who asked for information on this subject the Minister of Propaganda replied that no such immigration was possible since “ the frontier was closed ”— not only an inaccurate statement but an unfortunate phrase of the usually accepted meaning of which he was presumably ignorant. In point of fact the frontier is very inadequately guarded, as the proposal to withdraw the gendarmerie or substitute military frontier guards has not yet been carried out. At the suggestion of the British military attache the Chief of the General Staff issued a communique and also made a broadcast statement on the Persian army’s radio transmission. It was worded as follows :— “ It has recently been observed that various reports have been published by the Persian press and by foreign agencies concerning the army and mili tary matters. The majority of these reports are absolutely without founda tion, and the Ministry of War takes this opportunity of requesting that all Persian journalists and foreign corres pondents in Persia will, in order to ensure the accuracy of their reports on military affairs confine themselves to statements made by the Army Informa tion Department. In this connexion the Ministry of War categorically denies the reports published by certain papers about the closing of frontiers, the entry of refugees and terrorist groups into Persia and the emigration of tribes, and declares them to be without foundation.” The Elections 2. Sezawar has been elected to the 15th Majlis for the constituency of Saveh, and Suleiman Zia Ibrahimi for Jiruft. External Security A zerhaijan 3. Ibrahimi, who was Prosecutor- General of Azerbaijan under the Democrat regime, was hanged in Tabriz on 23rd May. 4. His Majesty’s Consul-General,Tabriz, is of the opinion that the rumours of “Muhajir” infiltration and Russian mili tary concentrations on the frontier (see paragraph 1 above) have been put about by Soviet agents in order to keep Azerbaijan in a state of nerves. According to the same source, Jajarov and Ali Akbarov, two officials of the Soviet vice-consulate in Rezaieh. are active in inciting the Kurds and Assyrians of Western Azerbaijan against the Persian army. Bakhtiari 5. His Majesty’s acting consul at Isfahan reports increasing discontent among the Bakhtiari at Abul Qasim’s harsh and predatory rule. Disappointed in their efforts in Tehran with the Prime Minister to secure his removal, some of the khans are now talking of forceful measures and of installing Jehanshah Khan, son of Murteza Quli Khan, in his place. In high military circles in Tehran the view pre vails that one khan is as bad as another, and the rivalries between the two families of the Ilkhani and Haji Ilkhani are so great that no one candidate could be found who would be acceptable to both. Joint governorship has proved a failure and a solution must be found either in military 103-552 governorship or governorship by a non- Bakhtiari. Finance 6. The Persian press has had some sharp things to say about the failure, so far, on the part of the Soviet Government to repay to the Persian Government the 11 million odd grammes of gold which, by agreement with the National Bank of Persia, they were due to repay by 2nd March, 1946. 7. The negotiations between His Majesty’s Government and the Persian Government regarding the settlement of the Persian State Railway claims have not yet been concluded. Wide as was the gap between what the Persians claimed and His Majesty’s Government was prepared to pay, a compromise might have been effected but for an ill-timed pronouncement by the Persian Ministry of Propaganda to the effect that arbitration would be sought. As is usual, the Persian press had been free for months to make play with the amounts (some 20 million sterling) claimed by Persia and the populace had been led to expect this sum, and the Persian Government, in consequence, did not dare to court unpopu larity by accepting a smaller sum even though it represented an equitable settle ment. Arbitration, therefore, is a face saving device on the part of the Persian Government. The Court 8. His Imperial Majesty the Shah arrived in Tabriz on 25th May and has now left for the western side of Lake Urumiyeh on his tour of Azerbaijan. His Majesty’s consul-general at Tabriz reports that the welcome was spontaneous and enthusia^Tl Appointments 9.

The Chief of the General Staff informed the British military attach^ that it was unlikely that he would return. Following so soon after the departure of the Russian Ambassador, this event, trivial in itself, has caused widespread rumours to the effect that both have been recalled in disgrace.Ho.71/21/47. .-sS* a JU C R S T .

With His Imperial Majesty The Shah still absent on tour there has been little or no visible political activity but the cabinet has not been idle as it has to face several problems demanding action in the near future among which the budget is oj. some urgency. In the first place the Prime Minister has to decide whether the time has now come for him to request the Shell to convene the Majlis. i uch as Qawam-us-Saltaneh may dislike the prospect of facing that body it is difficult to see how oven such a skilled procrastinator as.ho is can avoid summoning it for much longer. Secondly there is much evidence to shew that the Treasury is embarrassingly short of money. Thirdly it is obvious that very soon Qawej.i-us-Salta.neh must do what is to any Persian a distasteful thing, namely to make up his mind as to the next step in the business of the Russian oil concession. 2, The Persian Government has made a formal request for the agremont j for Mohsin Rais as Persian Ambassador in London in succession to Taqizadeh. A note on the new ^Ambassador will be given in a latcrissue of this summary when His Majesty’s Government’s reply to the request is known, 3» It is learnt from several reliable sources in Tehran that Muzaffar Firus, the Persian .Ambassador in Moscow, has been granted one or two months leave of absence and that he and his wife intend to go to Prance cr Switzerland 4.

Many members had criticised Qawam’s management of his party and his conduct of governments affairs and Malik-us-Shuara Bahar, a former minister of education, in particular, had openly insulted him ana called upon him to resign from leadership both of the Government and 01 the party. The main charged levelled at Qawam was corruption and it semns that ho v/as unwise enough to admit collecting money by irregular moans bu he was careful to add that it was for the party's coffers and not ior himself, Whilo Qawam's detractors are as busy as ever spreading rumours of his precarious position and impending resignation, talk, which is less irre sponsible from many quarters on the subject of Cabinet changes is heard in increasing volume. 2.

Political. 1. On the 19th June the Government resigned and Qawam-us- Sultaneh, at the request of the Shah, formed a new one which assumed office on 21st. It is Qawam’s fifth cabinet and is composed as follows:- Prime Minister. Minister of the Interior. Minister for foreign Affairs. Minister for War. Minister for National Economy. Minister for Justice. Minister for Finance. Minister for agriculture. Minister for Health. Minister for Education. Minister for Gommunications. Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. Ahmad Qawam, (Qawam-us- Sultaneh).

Salman iiS^adi (F.0.19). Ministers without portfolio. Ali Asghar Hikmat fF.0.58). Akbar Musavizadeh (@). Muhammad Ali Humayunjah (F.0.60)(@). 2. The cause of this sudden change of cabinet was the charge -.of corruption made against the Qawam and his ministers by members of his own Democrat Party at party meetings. By this move he has rid himself of the more corrupt elements and has, at the same time, cast off some of the more-inert members. The change is not considered to indicate any. major change of policy.X*. - 2 - S) 3. The outstanding point of interest is the oreati ministry, that for National Economy, According to of ments published, it has been formed as the result of a reoommenda- r y r&gt; the High C i )unoil of banning.

The first indication that such a ^policy has been adopted at last is contained in a radio announce- “ment of the meeting of a ’’Commission for Welfare cf the Tribes”. This ia the first that has been heard of this body. To make a commission of this sort really effective it is also necessary to have a council of tribal leaders. A proposition passed by such a body would then be a proposal made officially on behalf of what is a considerable percentage of the total population of the country, instead of being what can be represented to be a self-interested ’’demand” by the leaders of/isolated tribe ' PERSIAN ARMY. 9. It is announced in the Press, and was confirmed in conversation with the Assistant Military Attache by the Minister for War, that the financial negotiations between the Army and the United States Government have been brought to a successful conclusion. The surm finally agreed uoon is given as 25 million dollars and the period of repayment as 12 years from 1951, the total bearing 2 to 3 per cent interest. It is referred to in the pr ss as a credit: but the Minister for War said in converstaion that the agreement would require ratification by the Majlis and that the Iranian Army commission were engaged on the selection of equipment so that it could lie shipped with the minimum of delay after the ratification. PERSIAN GENDARMERIE. 10. Brigadier Husian Mushiri left Tehran for the United States on 16th June to join General Schwartzkopf and assist him in the selection of the Gendarmerie share of the equipment being provided uhier the ’’credit” mentioned in the preceding paragraph. Brigadier Mushiri is Director of Ooerations and Colonel Asifi is acting for him in his absence, which he expects to last six months. 11. Brigadier Mushiri in conversation with the Assiefeant Military Attache before denarture gave the present strength of the Gendar merie as 24,000. This is far above the figure of 15,000 which was agreed to as the authorised strength in March (see paragraph 13 of Summary No*16) and Brigadier Mushiri was vague as to when the reduction would start. It appears that the decision was not as final as appeared to be the case at first. BRITISH INTERESTS. 12. On 18th June a contract was signed between Messrs. Alexander Gibbs and Company with the Kuh-i-Rang Company for the first part of the' project of taking water from the Karun River through into the Isfahan area. This first part, which represents a value of £500,000 comprised only the driving of a tunnel through the Kuh-i- Rang mountain.

Sarhang Sami’i had been successful and honest in his job and it is understood that he had quarelled with the divisional com mander, Sarhang Saqafi, for not having provided him with sufficient money. Pishdad has now been relieved in his turn by Sarhang Hasan Muinpur, who was until recently Iranian Military Attache in Bagdad. It is reported that Muinpur is a good friend of Saqafi, having worked under him in the general staff. The present Military Governor of Ahwaz is Sargurd Afshar. It is not known what has happened to Pishdad. “ It appears that Saqafi has been making money on a scale which far sur passes the normal, and further scandals have come to light in military circles in the discovery of the vast sums which the Chief Prosecutor of the Military Court in Abadan, Sargurd Na’ima, and the conscription officer, Sargurd Zinati, have been making, out of which they are alleged to have paid Sarhang Saqafi his due. If Muinpur is the friend he is said to be it is to be presumed that graft will be continued on a large scale.” Persian Army 8. Brisradier - General Darakhshani, O former commander of the 3rd (Azer baijan) Division, has been sentenced to life imprisonment by a military tri bunal which has been sitting for the past three months. He has appealed against the sentence. Colonel Zariv and Major Mustashari, respective commanders of the iVrdebil and Miandoab garrisons, were acquitted. It will be recalled that Brigadier-General Darakhshani was com manding in Tabriz at the time of the sur render of the Persian army garrison to the Azerbaijan Democrat rebels in Novem ber 1945. As stated at the time, Darakhshani would, at any rate before any British court, stand a very good chance of acquittal in the light of the incompre hensible orders which were sent to him by the General Staff on instructions from the Prime Minister of those days, Hakimi. They were to the effect that he should resist but avoid any clash with the Demo crat forces. Since the latter had beseiged his troops in their barracks and had pre vented the entry of food and water, it is difficult to see' how Darakhshani could have carried them out. Labour 9.

The Persian Government, it is reliably reported, are not in any way perturbed at the one-sided, pro-Tudeh nature of the report, and would welcome the opportunity to refer the matter to United Nations Organisations, and expose the questionable activities of and wilfully erroneous conclusions drawn by El Aris and his colleagues while in Persia. 10. The Persian delegation led by Habib Nafisi has arrived at the I.L.O. conference at Geneva. The workers’ delegates’ cre dentials have been accepted and the dele gation is taking full part in all discussions. Communications 11. A press report states that 50 kilom. of the Tehran-Qum road have been asphalted and that the remaining 90 kilom. will be completed early in October. 12. Asphalting of the Kerej-Qazvin road is proceeding rapidly and about 45 out of 65 miles have been completed. The work has been very badly done and no attempt has been made to smooth out the corrugations before laying the asphalt. 13. The portion between Hamadan and Assadabad on the Tehran-Baghdad road, laid by the British in the late war, has deteriorated sharply. No repairs are being done and after another winter’s snow and rain the pot holes will reduce speed of passenger vehicles to 15 m.p.h. The worst portion is on the Assadabad pass (marked, for some unknown reason, on British survey maps as the “ Shah ” pass). Appointments 14. —(i) His Majesty’s Government have now given their agreement to the appoint ment of Mohsin Rais as Persian Ambassa dor to London (see paragraph 2 of Intelli gence Summary No. 22). He is expected to arrive in London at the end of July. A note on him will be found in Foreign Office Personalities No. 143.

The past weuk or ten days has been remarkable for the growing volume and virulence of the criticism of the Prime Minister. There were some who thought that the chief cause of discontent lay in the dishonesty of Qawam—us—saltaneh* s supporters and yet the reshuffle oi the cabinet and the dropping of Aramish and Mikpay, alledgodly the most corrupt, has in no v/ay diminished the spate of criticism. There is good ground for believing that the Court is taking a hand. The success of the royal tour seems to have gone to the Shah 1 s head and, egged on by General Yazdanpanah, his Chief A.D.C* and Military adviser, he seems to be throwing his weight about in a manner in which he would not have dared to do a few weeks ago. The Prime Minister's political opponents, including many would- be Majlis deputies deprived of their seats by the manner in which the elections were carried out, rose up to attack him secure in the knowledge that Martial Law having been suspended they could^ arbitrarily incarcerated at his pleasure. The newspapers, too, free from the fear of suppro ad in, gave vent to their pent up feelings. As always, the Persians are more swayed by rhetoric than logic and they give Qawam—us-saltanch no credit for his achievements during his tenure of office. In the first flush of their freedom they gave full rein°to their undoubted capacity for invective mistaking freedom for indiscipline, liberty for licence. 2. The cabinet, at a meeting on 7th July, decided to reimpose martial law in Tehran. It is known that the Prime Minister was both incensed and alarmed at the recent press attacks upon him but he claimed, as justification for the rcimposition of martial law, knowledge that certain subversive elements had planned acts of violence for the 17th July, the day fixed for the opening of the Majlis. Accord ing to the Minister for War he and Ali Asghar Hikmat only out of the entire cabinet were opposed to the measure on the grounds that the capital was quiet and that during the past year martial law had been used, not to keep order in a disturbed area, but solely as a device to silence criticism, suppress hostile newspapers and to incarcerate political opponents against whom no charges were framed and who were detained at the Prime Minister's pleasure under a vague clause relating to subversive acts against the safety of the realm. The Minister for War finally signed the decree but later withdrew his signature on learning that the Shah's permission had not bo^n previously obtained* As Minister for War, he said, ho could not agree to the measure without the prior consent of the Shah as Commandcr-in-Chicf of Persia's forces. The Prime Minister considered this un necessary on the grounds that the Shaft*when consulted on this matter on 25 th Juno, had not vetoed such a decree but had only insisted that there should bo prior warning (see paragraph 1 of last Intelligence Summary). As the Minister for War persisted in his opposition he was called upon to resign. General Ahmedi refused to do so. The Prime Minister, late as the hour was, thereupon sought an audience with the Shah and secured the latter's approval to the issue of the decree and to General Ahmedi's dismissal, subsequently toned down to resignation tendered and accepted./12 53—wa f place his resignation in the hands of the Shah at the time of the cabinet re shuffle but that the Shah insisted on his remaining in office until the Hajlis be convened* Humours have been heard to the effect that after its convention on 17th July the Majlis v/ill be adjourned till the end of the summer. The heat at this season (unbearable to the Persian v/ho has lived in it all his lifel ) and the desire of the landowning deputies to visit their estates at harvest tine are given as the reasons. Constitutionally the Majlis takes legal shape when J + 1, i.c. 69 of the deputies’ credentials have been accepted. After this the Prime Minister tenders his resignation and a secret ballot is held to determine the Majlis’ choice of his successor. 5 . Three days of last week were devoted to the celebration of the second anniversary of the founding of the Prime Minister’s Iran Democrat Party. Meet ings were held. The Prime Minister gave a lengthy broadcast and on Friday a mass gathering of the party marched past him in the main square. Attendance was poor and it is said that as much as 5 /- a head was being paid to volunteers to ride in the bedecked lorries. INTERNAL SECURITY. Kerman. 6 .

He had been at large in disguise ever since the reoccupation of the province. 10. H.M’s Consul-General at Tabriz reports that the local newspaper’'Faryad' has been suspended by the Military Government for publishing untrue and alarmist accounts of Soviet-American relations. 11. H.M’s Consul-General also reports that a committee of enquiry sent by the General Staff has arrived from Tehran to investigate the circumstances in which Mulla Mustafa Barzani succeeded in eluding pursuit and making good his escape into Soviet territory. Some criticism of the Army in having allowed him to escape has appeared in the Press and the Chief of the General Staff is known to hold the view that the Army’s prestige has suffered. An unconfirmed but probably true report says that on account of their negligence over this affair General Humayuni, G.O.C* Kurdistan, has been deprived of a decoration and Colonel Nesari, commanding one of the co 3 iumns, has been compulsory retired.Numbers (i) and (iii)represented this constituency in the last Majlis* Number (ii) replaces Abdul Hamid Sanandaji, a local landowner and certain of election but wno was imprisoned by Qawan-us-saltanch as a political opponent* APPOINTilENTS» 13* (i) Dr Fakhr-ud-din Shadman to be Director of the Iran Insurance Company* He had been assistant to Fathullah Nuri Isfandiari when the latter was Persian Government Commissioner with the A*I*0*C* in London.

This may be true but it does not appear probable that the Prime Minister, with the country in its present state, his own position none too strong and the kaj 'as about to be convened in a day or two, would havo allowed the Army to embark co m operation which might prove costly in time, treasure and men. It seems more lamely ciiat this was an opening gambit by General Razmara to heighten Qashqai nervousness and to increase the bia they will make to him to avert disarmament (see paragraph 6 of Intelligence Summary No.25).

There are many laaiours current in Tehran concerning the impending action by the Persian Army against the Qashqai. So far there is no evidence to stultify the opinion expressed in the last sentence of paragraph 9 of Intellig ence Summary No.2?, The fears which the Prime Minister is believed to enter tain regarding General Razmara’s intention to start large scale disarmaiDBJl operations against the Qashqai appear, at least for the moment, to be exaggera ted. In conversation with the British Military Attache on 26th July General Razmara denied any reinforcement of the Pars forces over the figure of last year except for a slight increase due to the resumption of conscription, made possible by the ro-establishment of the various garrisons after the collapse of the Pars revolt of last autumn. General Razmara said that disarmament of the Khamsoh, Hunasari, and coastal tribes was proceeding slowly. Even those toug. customers the Boir Almiedi had handed in some rifles. He was confident that the Qashqai could also bo induced to do sowithout recourse to military operations provided their leaders were removed. The Army therefore, said Razmara, ha decided to order Nasir Khan and lOiosro abroad for a holiday. The former had already resigned his seat in the Majlis and the latter must do so too as the Army would not tolerate as a Majlis deputy a man who had brought about the death of Persian Army officers in action. Mal-k Mansur was already abroad on medical treatment and this would leave only Muhammad Husain of the four ^brothers to represent the tribe in Tehran. When questioned by the British Military Attache firstly as to the Prime Minister's possible reactions to a plan to reject the election crudenoials of a deputy who was believed to have subscribed heavily to the Party funds and secondly as to the apparent violation in the adoption of the Chief of + he General Staff’s plan of the general amnesty pro claimed after the collapse of the pars revolt of last autumn (paragraph 0 (X) of intelligence Summary No.U of 1946) the Chief of the General ^off replied thrt, though the Prime Minister was certain to shew opposition, the Shah cS adanaiifc on the question and considered that in the unseating and expulsion of Khosro Qashqai the Array's prestige was at stake.-if- 1 11 &lt;/ Persian ofiicer or to tamper vd.th his loyalty, the Russian' oonsul-gencral at Tabriz haa so abusea his position with the result that no less than twenty four ^ hi. 3 ofiicers ha.a joined the Azerbaijan rebel movement or the equally rcbill- ious cause of llulla Hustafa Barzani. History would seem to be repeating itself and, as in the days of Roza Shah, others suffer for Russian sins. li&amp;SIAN GEHDiJd jIIRIE . 11.

RUSSIAN INTERESTS, ^3* The Chief of the General Staff info.red the British Military Attache on 26th July that during the past month no less than fourteen fugitives from Soviet territory had entered Persia. The majority had crossed the frontier in the thickly wooded area near Astara. Six of them were serving soldiers,Only two of these were Azerbaijanis the remainder being natives of the Crimea and White Russia serving in the Caucasus. They gave as the reason for their desertion the inadequacy of their rations and the^polling conditions prevailing in the Red Army. They are at present under detention in the custody of the Military Police. The Russians had, according to the Chief of the General Staff, demanded their extradition but the Pensian Government had refused on the grounds that the Soviet Government, when asked by the Persian Government to extradite the Azerbai jan rebel fugitives and, more recently, Mulla Mustafa, had refused to do so. /One■S'?-5- aoserters m ifh^^v t0 t ^ f rs:L “ inter ™Ca tin 2 otlLfr by o»e-of the military ciosorters is haudly credible.

Political. 1. The credentials of some of the fourteen deputies enumerated in paragraph 1 of last Intelligence Summary have now been accepted by the Majlis but new objections have boon raised to others. In short, the Majlis has been having a wonderful time. In this, as in most Persian games, the rules are not very clear nor is too close an observance of them necessary. The first step is for a deputy to secure acceptance of his own credentials by intensive lobbying among his friends and the offer of his support for the future in return for theirs. Once his credentials are accepted the deputy has scored a 'base' from which un assailable position he can proceed to object vociferously to the credentials of others including those from whom he received support and to whom ho pledged his own. If the candidate objected to buys off the objectors several points are scored. If he ultimately wins his scat the objectors have at l.cast the satisfac tion of having held up the country 5 s parliamentary business for a week. 2# During the scrutiny of the credentials a most vielont attack was made on Hasan Taqizadeh, till recently Persian Ambassador in London. It was led by Abbas Iskandari, the Hamadan Deputy and a cousin of Iraj Iskandari, the Tudeh boss. The part which Taqizadeh was called upon to play as his country * 1 s^ representative in London during me Azjoreaajan crisis would account for his unpopularity with the Tuueh and their Russian masters, but equally violent oppos ition came from some of the right wing deputies who are members of the Prime Minister 1 s paarty and whose opposition, it is believed, was directed by the Prime Minister himself a.s a manoeuvre to prevent the subsequent elec cion of Ta.qiza.doh to the Presidentfcvlchair by procuring the rejection of his credentials. ii.s stp.tod in paragraph 2 of last Intelligence Summary the Prime Minister would prefer the pliability of Sardar Fukhir to the rugged independence of Taqizadeh. Among the many insultihg things sa,id about ham two rather quaint accusations were imdo. The first was that in the days of the Persian Revolution of 1905-06 Taqizadeh, as one of the leaders in the struggle for the constitution, had taicen refuge ('bast') in the British Legation. That he and several others did so and thereby saved themsoIvcs from the certain vengeance of the roactionary Muhammad Ali Shah is truo but Taqizadeh 5 s action was hailed as proof that ho was the paid agent of a Foreign Power. The second charge was that as Minister oi Finance ho had acceptou. a bribe of several millions of pounds in return for which he had renewed the A.I.O.C. concession in the days following its unilateral cancellation by Roza Shah. Documents purloined from the state archives wore said to afford proof of this but subsequent examination disclosed the fact that uhe sums were actually paid into the Persian treasury as royalties. The attack collapsed and Taqizadeh s credentials were finally accepted.A 3* From the activities of the Majlis during the past ten days it is clear that the Prime Minister’s authority over his Democrat Iran Party is weakening and some competent observers go so far as to say that the paity is threatened /**^*ith cisintegration* Some thirty or forty deputies arc in open revolt and ixjCQ prepared, if ordered to do so, to follow the Shah against the Prime Minister* This revolt may be attributed, in part, to the fractious mood engendered among the deputies in this, as in past Majlises, by the scrutiny of each others cred entials (sec paragraph 1 above) but much more to the Persian character which militates against cohesion and discipline* 4* It is learned on very good authority that at the end of July, Muzaffar Firuz telegraphed to h:i s Government on the subject of the oilagreement. It would appear, therefore, that, unless the communication was made privately, Muzaffar Firuz has not resigned, as stated in paragraph 3 of Intelligence Summary No.28, but on return from leave has resumed his appointment. An unreliable source informed the British Military Attach^ that the Prime Minister was determined to retain Aiizaffar Firuz in Moscow and had cancelled the appoint ment of Fathullah Pakravan as his successor. 5* The Prime Minister has issued a statement deploring the widespread corr uption in government departments and announcing the steps he is taking to erad icate it. Five investigating committees are to be sot up to work in the following ministries:- (a) The Ministry of Finance especially the Rationing and Income Tax Departments* 1 b) The Ministry of Agriculture especially the forest department, c) The Ministry of Roads and the Railway Department, d) The Ministry of National Economy and the Industrial Bank, e) The Tehran Municipality, 6- The Persian newspaper 'Kaihan', quoting a Brazzaville news broadcast, announces that Peshaveri has been killed and Ghulan Yahya seriously injured in a motor accident in Baku. (These two leaders of the Azerbaijan rebellion fled to Russia when the Government forces re-occupied Azerbaijan).

The coincidence of four days of holidays during the past week has resulted in a lowering of the Majlis tempo and tempers. Later in the week feelings again ran high, some deputies claiming that the election of the Presidental body of the Majlis should now be taken up while others insisted on the prior completion of the scrutiny of the remaining credentials (see paragraph 2 below). Both sides base their claim on the laws governing Majlis procedure which document, like the Persian Constitution, appears to have been drafted mainly with an eye to subsequent equivocation. 2.

Finally a compromise was reached and, at the session of 17th August, Reza Hikmat, Sardar Fakhir, was elected President by 73 votes out of 112. Taqizadeh received 36 votes. Voting on the remaining credentials was to be re sumed at the session of 19th August. 2. As predicted in paragraph 11 of last Intelligence Summary new developments have occurred in the Russian demand for an oil agreement, but the situation is not yet clear. It is learnt on good authority that the Soviet Ambassador demanded rati fication by the Majlis within three months of an agreement drafted by his Government on the lines of Qawam-us-Saltaneh’s under takings of April 1946. When the Prime Minister warned Mr. Sadtchikov that such a Bill would almost certainly be rejected by the Majlis and suggested further dis cussions to produce a Bill more likely to be acceptable to that body, Mr. Sadtchikov would not agree to put this suggestion to his Government. Thus, the only course open to Qawam-us-Saltaneh, once he has secured the election of a President, is to present the Bill and, by its rejection, to free himself and his country from the burden which had been pressing heavily on them for nearly two years. A careful choice of words will, of course, be necessary lest, on the one hand, he should subsequently be held personally responsible by the Russians for having failed to prevent its rejection and thus of having broken his pledges and, on the other, he should bring about his own fall from office by showing even mild sup port for an unpopular project. 3. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs has addressed a circular to all diplomatic missions in Tehran requesting them to refrain “ in accordance with Persian law from publishing in Persia newspapers and reviews.' The Persian text is no less ambiguous than the French press report as to the exact type of publication banned but it is understood that the daily news service put out by the Information Depart ment of His Majesty’s Embassy will not be affected. In private conversation with Persian officials the same excuse is trotted out as was invariably used in the days of Reza Shah, i.e., “it is the Russians whom we are really after but, of course we cannot discriminate.’' Internal Security Pars 4. (See paragraph 6 of last Intelligence Summary) General Muini, the General Officer Commanding Pars Division, on his return from Tehran to Shiraz announced that disarmament of the tribes would begin immediately. He referred to the general amnesty proclaimed by the Shah at the conclusion of the Fars revolt of last autumn and also said that the Government were taking steps to ameliorate the economic lot of the province by raising the standard of living and by lowering prices. Some indi cation that the Persian Government hope to induce the tribes to hand in their rifles without recourse to military operations is afforded by the recent visit to Tehran of some of the chiefs of the Darrehshuri, Farsimadan and Kashkuli sections of the Qashqai tribe who are known to be in opposition to Nasir Khan and his brothers on account of their unwise policy, dictatorial control and shameless self enrichment. Ker mans hah 5. His Majesty’s Consul reports a recrudescence of Tudeh Party activity. The local newspaper Bisitun once more acts as its organ. Some fifty of the A.I.O.C. 106-52 employees have enrolled themselves as members. The Russian cultural institution V.O.K.S. is said to be responsible for this revival. 6. Some rifles are being collected from the Babajani and Qubadi tribes. A Persian army battalion has been sent to the area but has not so far been called upon to use force. K urdistan 7. The Chief of the General Staff in formed the British military attache on 19th August that during the past week a band of Herki from Iraq had entered Persia and, after a clash with a Persian army column just south of the Mergawar plain had crossed into Turkish territory where another skirmish occurred between them and Turkish troops. The Court 8. H.R.H. Princess Ashraf has left Tehran for the United States on the invita tion of the American Red Cross. Finance 9. Abul Hasan Ibtihaj, Governor of the Banque-i-Milli, is proceeding to the United Kingdom for discussions regarding the International Monetary Fund and Persia’s sterling balances. Administration 10. The Department of Registration and Civil Status of the Ministry of the Interior has announced its intention to issue new identity cards for the population. These will be “ security ” printed. The decision, it is announced, was rendered necessary by the large number of unauthorised identity cards issued by the rebel Azerbaijan Demo crat Government while in power. In the course of the statement by the Ministry of the Interior in this connexion it is said that “ according to the statistics obtained in 1322 (1943-44) the population of Persia was estimated at 16.549,830 (8,309,349 males and 8,240,482 females) distributed among 107 cities, 1,062 towns and 41,521 villages.” It should be remembered that no complete census has ever been taken in Persia and that the above figures were based on statistics obtained for the purposes of the issue of ration cards in which, ob viously, it was in the interest of the com piling officers to return a population in excess of that actually existing. The Per sian Government has adhered to this fictitious figure ever since partly in order to secure larger quotas of controlled com modities from abroad and partly, for reasons of national pride, in order to refute the accusations of national decadence im plied in the estimates by foreign travellers of a population of 12 million in a land which is popularly supposed to have supported upwards of 20 million in the days ol the Safawi dynasty. Persian Army 11. Manoeuvres for the senior term at the Staff College were held during the past week and H.I.M. The Shah was present on the concluding day at Kerej, 25 miles west of Tehran. Foreign service attaches were not invited. General Razmara informed the British military attache that the manoeuvres were in reality little more than a route march to the Qaflan Kuh and back to test the endurance of the troops and of the staff college students and that they were not adjudged to be of sufficient interest to warrant the presence of foreign service attaches. In view of General Razmara’s recent xenophobic tendencies this information does not carry much con viction especially in view of the fact that, on the concluding day at Kerej, for the benefit of the Shah a formation of six of their newly acquired Hurricane aircraft carried out an attack with cannon on an enemy strong post on a hill side, a distinct advance on any aerial manoeuvres yet seen in Persia. Communications 12. —(i) The asphalting of the Tehran- Qazvin road has now been completed with the exception of the last 5 miles from Sharifabad to Qazvin. This portion re quires a new soling before it can be surfaced. (ii) A British traveller reports that, so far, only one-third of the asphalting of the Tehran-Qum road has been completed. Appointments 13. —(i) Sarlashgar Iraj Matbui (M.A. 106) and Sartip Munir Darakhshan (M.A. 55) to be Director and Deputy Director, respectively, of Army Purchase.'

Resignations 14. —(i) Mashayekhi from the post of Mayor of Tehran (press report requiring confirmation). The peculations of this rogue have been on a gigantic scale and have done much political damage to the re putation of the Prime Minister who has3 ^pp^upported him against attacks sustained over a long period. Mashayekhi’s un popularity is such that his credentials as a Majlis Deputy have also met with strong opposition. Salman Assadi from Minister of r and Propaganda (in the hope that this step may accelerate the acceptance by the Majlis of his credentials as a Deputy). Indian Interests 15. The Persian Prime Minister has sent messages of goodwill to the Governments of India and Pakistan.4 THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT SECRET _.t^8096/17/34 PERSIA: MILITARY ATTACHE’S INTELLIGENCE SUMMARY No. 33 Period ending 25th August, 1947 {Communicated in Tehran Despatch No. 330 of 21th August; Received 3rd September) PERSIA. September 3, 1947 Section 1 Copy *0*53 Persian Affairs Political No startling developments have occurred over the Russian demand for an oil agree ment since those reported in paragraph 2 of last Intelligence Summary, but neither the Russians nor the Persians have been idle. The Persian Prime Minister is believed on good authority to have instructed the Persian Ambassadors in London and Washington to inform the British and American Governments of the situation as seen in Tehran and, in so doing they have both enquired what the two Governments’ reactions would be to a direct intervention by Russia in the event of the oil agreement Bill being rejected by the Majlis. Activity on the Russian side consists chiefly of a war of nerves. Radio messages from Tass and other sources during the early part of the week spoke of ‘ ’ an agreement which is about to be signed in accordance with the Persian Govern ment’s undertaking of April 1946 ” and used other phrases which implied that the granting of the concession was a foregone conclusion. Later in the week the tone changed and, in an article in Pravda, the Persian Government was accused of delay ing tactics and, under pressure from ‘ ‘ reactionary elements ’ ’ and foreign powers, of attempting to evade its previous undertakings. Another feature of this war of nerves is the crop of rumours of large-scale Russian military reinforce ments on the Persian frontier, both in Azerbaijan and Khorasan. These are probably put about by the Russians them selves and are repeated with exaggerations by timid and credulous Persians. The Majlis 2. The scrutiny of the credentials of Mashayekhi, the ex-Mayor of Tehran, pro duced an acrimonious debate in the Majlis. So unpopular was this rogue that hostility 106-38 to him was almost universal and came both from his fellow members of the Prime Minister’s Iran Democrat Party and from the thirty Deputies comprising the Opposi tion. He silenced the first group by saying that whatever he had done as mayor he had done on the orders of the Prime Minister and by threatening to make more startling revelations. The second group he is reported to have bought up at 5,000 tomans apiece. The resulting expenditure (some £10,000) will make no appreciable hole in his profits. Thus baulked of its prey, the Majlis sought for a fresh victim and proceeded to reject the credentials of Kohbud, the wealthy mer chant elected from Saujbulagh. Having thus suitably demonstrated its powers it got on with the business in hand and, at its session of 24th August, elected the following as vice-presidents : Amir Husain Bakhtiari (son of the late Ilkhani, Sardar Zafar) and Hasan Nabavi. Four secre taries and three tellers were also elected. According to Persian parliamentary pro cedure elections for the presidential body take place twice yearly in October and April. 3. Husain Maki, Ghulam Husain Rahimian and Dr. Baqai, Majlis Deputies for Arak, Quchan and Kerman respectively, have resigned from the Par liamentary Fraction of the Prime Minis ter’s Iran Democrat Party. 4. The newspaper Ettelaat states that, as the result of charges brought by the editor of Mihan, the Public Prosecutor has issued orders for the prosecution of Muzaffar Firuz, lately Persian Ambassa dor to Moscow and still there, though his exact status is not known. Little importance need be attached to this state ment, owing to Muzaffar Firuz’s present whereabouts, the influence of his patron, the Prime Minister, and, most of all, to the appalling state of the Ministry of Justice, cynically compared by a Persian to a slot2 machine which absorbs not pennies but pounds without giving a sign that its interior mechanism is out of order. Internal Security Khorasan 5. His Majesty’s Consul-General at Meshed reports that, following on the dis continuance of the Russian air services in Persia, the Russian W/T station on the aerodrome at Meshed has been dismantled and moved to Tehran. 6. His Majesty’s Consul-General, quoting Persian sources, also refers to continued movement of Russian troops along the Persian border towards Afghanistan, but concludes that they are due to the coincidence of manoeuvres with reinforcement of Russian frontier posts. {See also paragraph 1 above.) Azerbaijan 7. Fourteen further executions have taken place in Sarab of persons convicted of complicity in the Democrat revolt of last year. Fars 8. General Muini, the General Officer Commanding, Ears Division, and the Tehran press are making great play with the amnesty recently proclaimed by the Shah. It is a vague document and makes no attempt to specify the acts for which pardon has been granted or the limits of time between which those acts were per petrated nor, indeed, to distinguish between acts of concerted tribal rebellion and ordinary crime unconnected with the disturbances. The Chief of the General Staff, when asked by the British Military Attache why a fresh amnesty was necessary when one had already been proclaimed last year as part of the agreement between Nasir Khan Qashqai and the Government, replied that the original amnesty was deemed to have lapsed since the tribes had not fulfilled their side of the bargain by handing in their arms. Persian Army 9. The Persian General Staff have at their disposal a reasonable budget pro vision to defray the cost of tuition for officers sent abroad to foreign military schools. Actually this sum is frittered away on expensive and fruitless “ joy rides ” for senior generals, e.g., General Firuz’s protracted tour of the United States and the United Kingdom, or on unnecessarily large purchasing missions, e.g., the recent mission to the United States which has been kicking its heels in America for the past three months. The General ^ Staff announced some months ago that it was willing to allow selected officers to attend foreign military schools at their N own charges. They would receive allowances but would draw ordinary at Persian rates. The selection of six officers to proceed to the United States under this scheme is announced in the press. Appointments “ T,” Civil 10— (i) Ali Akbar Rasuli to be Governor of Bijar. (ii) Dr. Khalatbari to be Mayor of Tehran, vice Mashayekhi resigned. Khalat bari will retain his appointment as technical assistant to the Minister of the Interior. £t R,” Military (i) Sartip Ghulam Husain Muqtadir (M.A. 126) resumes his previous appoint ment of Deputy Minister of War (Administration).

It is stated in the Persian press that he will be leaving for Cairo in the near future.

Addendum to paragraph 14 {ii) of last Intelligence Summary. 12. An additional reason for the resignation of Salman Assadi (F.O. 19) is his desire to retain his post of Governor of the Industrial and Mining Bank, an appointment which he can legally hold in conjunction with his seat in the Majlis but not in conjunction with a Cabinet post./5.

Political. 1* After the election of the Presidential body of the Majlis a delegation was cnosen, according to constitutional practice, to inform H.I.M*The Shah that the Majlis was legally constituted and ready to transact the country’s usiness. This was done on 27th August* The Prime Minister tendered his resignation on the same day and the Shah thereupon requested the Sneaker to ascertain the wishes of the Majlis in regard to a new Prime Minister. A secret session was held on 28th August at which no agreement was reached but another on 30th August, when 116 deputies were present, Qawam-us-Saltaneh was chosen by 78 votes. The aged and highly respected Husain Pirnia, Hutamin-ul- Mulk (F.0.126), received 34 votes. Husain Samii, Adib-us-Saltanoh (F.0.153) received one vote and there were three blank voting naoers. H.I.M. The Shah was informed of this and sent for Qawam-us-Saltaneh and instructed him to form his cabinet. 2. Some seventeen Majlis deputies, most of them from Azerbaijan constituencies have formed themselves into a political party known as the 'National Union Fraction . These deputies, together with nineteen others who find themselves m disagreement with the Prime Minister, v/ere those who supported Taqizadch's candidature for the speakership and, last week, were the only deputies to vote against the choice of Qawam-us-Saltaneh as the next Prime Minister. Till recently, at any rate, they had the support of the Shah. ■ D J' ir i n S the past week it became increasingly clear that Qawam-us-Saltanch would be re-elected. Opposition from the Court slackened when the Shah was persuaded^that premature efforts to dislodge Qawan might bring the sole respon sibility ior the subsequent handling of the Russian oil question to rest on himself. Inside the Majlis, Qawam could still count on a substantial majority from among the members of his own pairty. A widespread revolt has not yet begun and may not begin for a month or two till it is brought about by those dissident tenaencies inherent in Persians and by the realization by his support ers that they cannot all have all th- good jobs all the time. Actually there was little practical difference between the views of his supporters and those of his opponents. The former held the view that only Qawam was astute enough to extricate the country from its present predicament and the latter that as it was ho who had brought the country into its present predicament it was up to him to extricate it. 4* _ It is believed on good authority that the Persian Government has asked the Soviet Government for their agrement to the appointment of Hamid Sayyah (F.0.155) as Persian Ambassador to Moscow in place of Muzaffar Firuz.

Corruption is thought to be thp cause as General Schwarzkopf once remarked J'Aiitajy Attache that iO»t&gt;srodad “was tidop* «*g?.ftfzatfon that he should never be i.eft in a job for more than six months”!§ /14 11. On 27th August the Chief of the General Staff spoke at some length to the British Military Attache on the subject of Azerbaijan. He dismissed as malicious rumours probably put about by the Russians themselves the reports of the massing for offensive purposes of Russian Troops on the Persian border and of the assembling there of several thousand of armed 'nuhajirs', ex-Azorbaijan democrat rebels and of Barzani and other Kurds under the leadership of Mulla ^ Mustafa with a view to marching into Persia to secure by force an oil concession or,less directly, to secure it by a throat of entry for which a pretext could bo fomod in a state of r hellion in Azerbaijan which could be interpreted as a menace to the Soviet Union justifying armad intervention under a clause in the Fcrso-Soviot treaty of 1921. He evlso described as a vr.r of nerves the nocturnal activities of the Russian frontier posts who fired off rockets, carried out night firing with machine-guns 'nd night driving with tanks while, by day, their artillery directed range-finders at prominent targets on the Persian sido* There v;as, however, he said information, regarded by him as reliable, which showed that the Russian garrisons at Nakhjawan, Erivan and Ga»jeh on the Azerbaijan frontier and along the Khorasan frontier had been increased four fold during the past two months. This information had been obtained from Rod Army deserters (seo paragraph 15 of Intelligence Suvaary No. 29 ), observation of railway traffic on those portions of the line visible from Persian territory (c.g* on the ^.ras river in ^z^rbaijan and near Askabdd in Khorasan) and from othur sources. If,contary to his forecast, these activities really were a prelude to invasion, the Pens'.an *.ray could not do much about it. He was concerned more with the improvement of the situation in Azerbaijan. H 3 referred to the recent assumption by the Army of certain duties of frontier control formerly carried out by the Gendarmerie also to the necessity of tightening up the scrutiny of idzztijycards of Persians and residence permits of foreigners (sec paragraph 10 of Intelligence Summary No. 32). Only by these means could an effective check be kept on the movements of the large number of Caucasian immigrants residing in Azerbaijan before the democrat rebellion and still resident there as also upon the movements of the numerous Russian employees of such concerns as Iransovtrans, oil distribution, trade agencies as well as consular establishments. He proposed to screen these muhajirs and to send the p liticnlly dangerous to the island of Hormuz in the Persian Gulf and the politically unreliable to places in the centre and South East of Persia where they could earn a living in employment on public works. The remainder, i.e. chiefly those who had been settled on the land for a long period, could remain in Azerbaijan. To enable the Army to carry out these extra duties he had obtained a credit of ten million rials and had despatched an extra battalion of infantry to Azerbaijan. He also proposed to proclaim as prohibited zones most of the Turco-Persian and Russd-persian frontier areas as was done in Reza Shah’s tine. BALUCHISTAN (PERSIAN). 12. The Hindu and Sikh communities of Zahidan are nervous lest the communal tension in India may spread to this border town. They have asked the local governor to afford them police protection in the event of their being attached by Muslims either local or Indian. 13• The Persian press continues to give prominence to complaints by the inhabitants of Zabul district to the effect that the H'elnand river has been diverted by the Afghans and that, as a result, their crops will dio of drought. Burzoo Kalhur, the governor of Zabul, now in Tehran, in conversation with the British Military Attache’ tended to ridicule this accusation against the Afghans and explained the drying up of the Helmand as an annual phenomenon due to the ’’wind of 120 days” blowing at this season.No.7V35A7q British Embassy, TEHRAJ^. 9th September/ 1947* SEC R E T t MILITARY ATTACHE T s INTELLIGENCE SUIL'ARY No&gt; 3 b JMl PERIOD ENDED 9 th SEPTEJ/IBER 19L7, PERSIAN AFFAI RS.

PERSIAN AFFAIRS. Political. perhaps, to the strict measures now being taken in Azerbaijan y he military authorities, wild rumours of a Russian invasion of Persia have been less in evidence during the past week, but steady pressure is being main tained by the Russian Ambassador on the Prime Minister and by the Russian press on the public. The press bureau of the Soviet Embassy in Tehran published on st September a long article entitled 'the Soviet reply to the Persian Press'. I traced the history of the negotiations in Moscow in February and March of 1946 fof an oil agreement and reproduced the texts of the letters exchanged between Qavam-us-Saltaneh and k. Sadtchikov on 4th April, 1946, describing those negotiations as an 'agreement' and the subsequent exchange of letters as 'confirmation' of it. During the past week it has been persistently rumoured that Muzaffar ^iruz, accompanied by a high Soviet official, paid a flying visit to Tehran, held secret converse with the Prime Minister and departed as silently as he came. A parliamentary question as to the truth of this and also as to what Muzaffar Firuz was doing in Moscow after he had been relieved of his duties as ambassador drew an official denial from the Pars agency v/ho stated that Firuz had not returned to Persia since his departure from Russia. No one can be found who is prepared to testify as to where and when he saw Firuz or the method of locomotion used but. despite the denial, the rumour persists and certain dabblers in the occult and pedlars of mysteries describe the source of their information in their usual jargon either as 'usually well-informed' or 'highly placed'. THE MAJLIS. , No business of any great importance has been transacted during the past week. The debate on the credentials of Arsanjani continues. On 16th September, opening the debate on the Governments programme, Husain Maki demanded the abolition of martial law and severely criticised the Government for retaining a surplus of employees and fof the alleged maladministration of the Industrial and He was £ ollowed b Y Kishawarz Sadr. On 18th September an able and restrained reply for the Government was made by Hazhir, the Minister of Finance. Seventeen deputies, including the two mentioned above, have registered their names thr C ^ lnS at ^ ack . thc Government on its programme. To one unacquainted with th Persian character it may seem strange that some eight or nine of these deputies owe their seats entirely to the Prime Minister who imposed them upon constituencies in which, otherwise, they would not have secured a single votel On 21st September the attack against the Government was continued by Mamaghani th^onlt dCPUty + and D « ^ tGbar &gt; member for Burujird. The former maintained that 17 ° f th ? Kini ster were those who received remunerative ™ . Thc 111311 cost of high from no valid economic reason, and the frittering away of the country* s wealth to pay for luxury imports /wore- 2 - ,'icA) wore adduced as proof of the ineptitude of the idifinistratioi.

He reports that in these two towns anti-Russian sentiments predominate and that the Soviet consuls no longer appear to have much contact with the populace.

Polltjoal. 1. The dominant topic remains, of course, the Russian oil agreement# Except for some discussion in the Majlis (referred to in para 2 below) no new developments have occurred and what Qawam-us-Saltaneh intends to do remains a matter of pure conjecture# The following remarks, therefore, shed no fresh light on the matter but may serve as a rough survey of the various opinions hold# His opponents stoutly maintain that he has every intention of securing the agreement for the Russians and merely hesitates as to the best method of doing so# These opponents correctly predict, that the granting of this concession will result in the loss of Azerbaijan to Persia since no safeguards devised by the wit of man, lot alone a Persian, will be effective if one party lacks the moans with which to enforce them and the other party has, from ths outset, no intention of observing them# As to the method by which Qawam may secure the passing of the bill through the Majlis these opponents are less united and on loss sure ground in their predictions# Seme say, with absolute truth, that Persians are mercurial, that, though capable of spasmodic bravery, their courage soon oozes away, that they often tremble tomorrow at their temerity of yesterday, and that though not more than twenty deputies might now be found who are prepared to grant the oil •onocssion, this number might swell to a majority under Russian threats, Russian bribery or Russian propaganda to the effect that reliance on Anglo-Saxon ability to support Persia or upon U.N.O ! s capacity to defend her were vain# Others there are who say with less appearance of truth that Russia has realized that Qawam* s powers of procrastination and the hostility of tho Majlis are obstacles which they cannot overcome by legitimate means and that they will bring tho Central Government to its knees by staging a second Greece in Azerbaijan# Qawam’s supporters, on the contrary, say for American and British •onsumption that ho has no intention of giving Persia* s oil to the Russians, but is in doubt as to the course which he should pursue to achieve his objects which are five fold, viz;— to secure the rejection of the bill, to avoid an open breach with Russia, to keep the U.N#0# seized of the Persian question, to prevent any impeachment of himself for his past actions in connection with tho agreement and, lastly, to seoure his own retention of tho Premiership# These two last arc undoubtedly the most important in his eyes and retention of office is easily discernible as the motive underlying most of his actions during tho past nineteen months* If one ficcepts the contention that he is against tho agreement those must be tho reasons why?*!ias not already asked for a vote on the issue in the Majlis# They are certainly the reasons for tho continuance of the debate on his programme to the ten points of which no Majlis deputy could raise serious objections# What tho Majlis fears is that by giving Qawam a vote of confidence on his programme (in which there is no mention of oil) they will automatically thereby give their approval to all his previous actions during tho long period when his cabinet ruled by decree without a Majlis, and thus, in a sense, shew their readiness to ratify tho draft agreement drawn up between him and the Russian Ambassador# Tho Russians, for their part, in addition to the war of nerves on Persia 1 s frontier are insisting on Qawam 1 s signing the agreement - they refuse to admit that it was a draft - before presentation to the Majlis* In these circumstances Qawam 1 s reluctance to grasp the nettle is gliderstandable• In the handling of this complicated matter some Persian /newspapers # •- 2 - ^ newspapsers have talbcn the unexpected line of attacMng the A.I.O.C. and demanding a rigorous revision - in some papers the cancellation - of its concession* They are not all Tudeh papers and it is not thought that the suggestions are put forward out of malice or any renewed hostility to the Company but are prompted by a desire to strengthen the argument against granting a Russian concession by striMng a nationalistic attitude of 'Persian oil for the Persians and no concessions to any foreigner'* ry. KHE MAJLIS. f* £ e ' 2* The debate on the Gc.ernment 1 s programme continued throughout the past week* Much of the criticism covered points already raised by previous speakers but some new ground was wavered, namely the Governments failure to establish an honest and capable administration in Azerbaijan, the inadequacy of its programme for the development of public services, its failure to extract its dues from the Soviet and British ©overnnents on account of customs duties and railway charges respectively and its supine attitude in the matter of the Holmand water dispute (see also paragraph 9 below)* A lengthy attack was made by Dr* Matin Daftari (en cx-Prime Minister interned by the allies for his pro-Axis sympathies in the late war) who said that the Government f s foreign policy was wrong in placing reliance on U.N.0. , in opportunist wobbling between Russia and Groat Britain or in courting American sympathy by loans and advisers. The only proper policy for Persia to pursue, said Matin Daftari, was to proclaim herself a neutral country like Switzerland and to formulate a 'Monroe Doctrine' for Persia* The remainder of his speech was devoted to enumerating some of the forty one different ways in which, he alleged, Qawam-us-Saltanch had violated the Persian Constitution during his nineteen months tenure of the Premiership* At the session of 28th September, Abbas Kasudi (Opposition - Tehran) proposed the addition of the following as clause 11 of the Government’s programme 'Immediate steps will be taken by the Government to explore the natural resources of Persia, especially oil. The Government will entrust the exploitation of these resources only to Persian companies and capital on reasonable terms and these exploitation companies shall be empowered, in order to sell their products, to conclude the necessary agreements with foreign purchasers after approval by the Council of Ministers'. Abbas Masudi was followed by Ahmad Aheri (Opposition - Ahar) who insult ingly referred to the Prime Minister as 'Pishevari’s accomplice'. Pandemonieci then broke loose and the Prime Minister walked out of the Chamber* THE iJIMENIANS. 3» The statement in the Persian Press to the effect that the Russian Consulate in Tehran could accept no more Armenians for emigration to the U.S.S.R. (reported in paragraph 13 of Intelligence Summary’ no. 35) has caused quite a political stirr The Russian Tass agpncy came out with a spirited counter-attack blaming the Persian Government (rightly it would appear) for having placed obstacles in the way of Armenian emigration* An announcement by the Department of Press and Propaganda now states that emigration is entirely voluntary and no obstacle will be put in the way of any Armenian wishing to leave Persia for the U.S.S.R. On 22nd September, the Chief of the General Staff in an interview with the British Military Attach^ supplied some confidential background to the above. He said that such information as had leaked out of Russia in the very guarded letters written by previous emigrants to their families disclosed an appalling state of affairs* They had been stripped of their valuables and money and even their clothes on entering Russia. Technicians and artisans had been drafted to factories and the un skilled of both saxes and all ages had been set to work as coolies on road making. More recently some thirty of these Armenian, emigrants had succeeded /inV ? -3- 1 thei i Wry br ' ok to ?ersir '&gt; vie. Turkey.

P f° 0f ° f the Perslan Government's inhuman attitude towards its Aimenian subjects in thus preventing their emigration. The above °? hero 2 t “&gt;d as graphically narrated as all and to » iterances, is, after aU, a Persian's version of the affair and, to the B.L.A. at any rate, supplies the first recorded instance of any Persian solicitude for their Amenian subjects. 7 INTERNAL SECURITY* Pars, tLt l ? 00 6 .°l last Int :Suny:).

In rep^y to a Parliamentary question by ohe of the duputies for +Baluchistan the Minister of Agriculture made a lengthy but unconvincing statement. He traced the history of this ancient dispute from the Goldsmith arbitration of 1872 through the subsequent investigations by MacMahon in 1902 to the Perso-Afghan agreement signed fifteen years ago* This agreement, he stated, was itself the subject of six years further discussion and a final agreement was signed by both Governments nine years ago but its provisions were never carried out by the Afghans. A Persian proposal to send experts into Afghan territory to study the problems on the spot evoked a counter suggestion by the Afghans to send a delegation into Persian Soistan to decide how much water the Seistanis required. There the matter rests for the moment. The Persian Government is being urged by some to submit the dispute to U.N. 0. while the afiltor.. of H Hhnn M , in ebullient mood, demands a declaration of war on Afghanistan.

Indeed, from casual oonvorsato with Persians of all shades of opinion (except those of the Tudeh group), it appears that public opinion is in favour of the scheme. As is usual with Porsiana, the practicability of the plan has not received much consideration (i.o. the availability of Persians as technical exports): but it has gained favour more on political grounds as the best way out of the present impasse. Firstly it does not give the concession to the Russians; secondly it does not provoke them by giving it to a foreign concern, possibly contrary to the original agreement: and finally any accusation of a dog-in-the-manger attitude in failing to utilize the oil is thereby avoided. INTERNAL SECURITY, AZERBAIJAN. ^ _ Reforonoe para 5 of last Int:Sw: the Chief of the Persian General Staff informed the B.M.A. that their estimate of Soviet troops on the Azerbaijan frontier was:— (i) 2 regiments of infantry plus 2 batteries of 105 -m guns at PuJ.-i-Dasht (Araplar) (J-38.D.

The Fisheries also agreed to purchase certain commodities such as food and clothing, in bulk, and to sell these at a low price through a form of co-operative to the workers. A proces verbal embodying the decisions reached in agreement has been prepared, the Fisheries stipulating only that proces verbal should be worded to imply that the management of the Fisheries is already implementing these promises, or that it has decided of its own accord to grant these concessions; the proces verbal, in other words, is not to indicate that the Persian Ministry of Labour has imposed any orders on the Fisheries./ 8 . I 9 *' \ i A INTERNAL SECURITY. Tribal-general. 5» The Chief of the General Staff on 13th October gave the British Military Attache the following rough figures rega:'cling tribal disarmamentt- (a) Number of rifles, pistols and machine-guns collected from Kurdistan and Azerbaijan 60,000 out of which 60$ were Persian Army weapons»lost at the time of the surrender of the garrisons in those areas. (b) numbers of rifles collected from other tribal areas in Persia 11,000# (o) numbers estimated to be still in tribal hands 120,000 out of which 85 % were in Fare and Khuzistan (among the Bakhtiari, Qashqai, Kuhigilu, Mamassani and Boir Ahmedi). (d) numbers re-issued on licence for protection of crops and flocks, for purposes of sport or to approved tribal leaders for local protection, 12 , 000 # PARS 6 . On 13th October the Chief of the General Staff expressed to the British Military Attache his dissatisfaction over the Qashqai disarmament. Initially some progress had been made in weaning the tribal chiefs away from the baneful influence of Nasir Khan and his three brothers. This had been achieved by direct negotiation with the former and also by supplying rationed commodoties for the tribesmen direct to the headmen of the sub-tribes instead of allowing them, as hitherto, to pass through the sticky fingers of the four brothers. The Chief of the General Staff also mentioned with gratitude the sound advice given to Nasir Khan by H.M. ’s Consul at Shiraz reported by him to the G.0.C and Governor General and, in turn, by the G.O.C. to the General Staff. Nasir Khan’s arrival in Tehran, said the C.G.S, augured well for a peaceful rendition of the arms but, to his annoyance, Nasir Khan had since gone back on his word and was once more in recalcitrant mood and was being sustained in this mood by no less a person that the Prime Minister v/ho;liad made it known to the Minister for War that he would not sanction any military operations in Pars against the Qashqai and that he saw no reason for sending Nasir Khan on a protracted holiday abroad. The situation therefore, said the Chief of the General Staff despondently, was back where it had been six months ago. AZERBAIJAN. 7* The Chief of the General Staff informed the Assistant British Military Attaohe on 8 th October that the additional Soviet troops referred to in paragraph 3 of last Intelligence Summary were withdrawn from the frontier on or about 4th October and that the Soviet frontier garrisons were now back at their former strength. (The Chief of the General Staff* s estinuate of the increase was four times the normal'* vide Intelligence Summary No.34 paragraph ll). On 13th October the Chief of the Gen. ral Staff informed the British Military Attache that observations of railway traffic in Ru? sia on the Aras valley line shewed that about 75% of the departures had been towards Baku and not towards Erivan. The two days prior to their departure had been devoted to manoeuvres visible from Persian territory. Possibly connected with these movements may be a report dated 6 th October from H.M ; s Consul-General Meshed who quotes Persian sources as stating that heavy movements of Russian troops from East to West had been observed on that portion of the Russo-Persian border.LABOUR. Habib Nafisi stated that he had been instructed by the Prime Minister on 8 th October to prepare a draft decree to establish an independent Labour Ministry. APPOINTMENTS.

He began to read the report at 6-30pm and Ali Asghar Hikmat, Minister without Portfolio^ took up the running at /-30pm and completed his task by 1-40pm. Thereupon Dr Rezazadeh Shafaq (Democrat — Tehran) presented a draft bill of a single article which, receiving 'double.urgency” procedure, was passed there and then by 102 votus to 2. The Prime Minister, after its first reading, had asked the deputies to remember the grave importance of the occasion and the need for reflection before taking a decision. He opposed the adoption of ‘’double urgency” procedure and declared that in his opinion the denunciation of the notes exchanged by him with the Soviet Ambassador in such a manner as to close the road to further negotiations with the Soviet Government was not in the interests of the country. (The position of Qaward s tongue in relation to his cheek while making this appeal is, unhappily, net recorded). The translation of the best Persian text so far obtained runs as follows SINGLE ARTICLE. (a) Whereas the Prime Minister in good faith, and as a result of an interpretation of the meaning of the second Article of the Law of December 2nd 1944, undertook discussions for the drawing up of tne agreement dated April 4'fch, 1946, regarding the creation of a mixed Perso-Sovict Oil Company; and whereas the Persian Majlis do not regard this interpretation as being consistent with the real.purport and meaning of the afore-mentioned law, they consider the above discussions and agreement to be without effect and null and void. The third paragraph of the communiqxi of the 4th April, 1946, is also null and void. (b) The Government shall make arrangements for a technical and scientiiic survey with a view to the discovery of oil deposits and shall, within a period of 3 years, draw and prepare complete /technical .~2~ J L '** h 'lace*. teoluij.oaj. and scientific maps of the oil*-bearing areas of the country so tnat the Majlis shall be able^ with full knowledge and information of the existence of oil in sufficient quantities, to mako^ arrangements for the commercial exploitation of this national wealth by passing the necessary laws. (c) Ihe grant of any kind of concession to foreigners for the extract ion of the oil and its by-products of the country and the creation of any kind oi Company for this purpose in which foreigners are in any manner shareholders f is absolutely forbidden. (d) If, after the technical survey mentioned in para (b), it is est^ i lisned that oil exists in commercial quantities in the Noibhuir. aruas of Persia, the Government are authorised to enter into negotiations with the Soviet Government for the sale to that Government of the products of this oil and to inform the Majlis of the results. (e) The Government are charged in all instances v/here the rights of the People of Persia in the sources of the country * s wealth, whether below or above the ground, have been impaired, especially lei-c. ^i.ag one oil in the South, to undertake the necessary negotia tion;-: and measures with a view to redeeming the rights of the nation, and they shall inform the Majlis of the results. NQTE_by_ M. A.:- The last sentence of para (a) refers to article (iii) of the agreement between the Prime Minister and the Soviet Government. The whole agreement (reported in para 1 of Intelligence Summary No. 13 of 1 92.6^ ran as follows:- ^ ' hi i The Russian military forces will evacuate Persia in the space of a month and a half from 2nd March, 1946: ' i^v ' k 0 e -S T,eemGn t to create a Russo-Persian oil company and the conditions pertaining thereto will be proposed to tho 15th majli.s after electron within a period of 7 months from 24 th March: (m; Concerning Azerbaijan, this being a Persian internal question peace.*- u-l. a 3T c Giants will be sought between the Persian Government and the populace of Azerbaijan to achieve : eoforns in accord with existing legislation and in a spirit ox ouGersbanding of tho people’s point of view. suit e hiKh Th i- ot'filti i “ a b i r °’? flrst to ^ ot » displayed statesmanship of 1 f ’ P1 ' 00 aoni ° a and his stock has soar/ed as the res' G 3113 doterm “ lat ' lon to roach a decision and of his tactics in portraying himself as tno saviour of his country.

After repeating the 80 Uxton USUQ ^ ' cna ‘t the Persian Government liad agreed to sign an oil /agreono nt. . . .^C\ -3- 1 ] o i y agreement it goes on to accuse the Government of presenting its report to the Majlis in a form clearly inaicating its disapproval of the agreement and in a Qawam*s policy is labelled as ma nner calculated to secure its rejection* • Dr Tabah, a Majlis deputy and nephew by marriage to the Prime Minister, informed the B.M.A. on 23rd October that three or four days previously in a Moscow broadcast the Soviet Government had announced its intention of postponing for a year further talks with the Persian Government concerning the oil agreement. No confirmation of this can be secured from any other source. It is possible that the Soviet Government had at last realized the futility of their hopeo of the measure being passed by the Majlis and had made the announcement as a face saving device» It is obvious that no announcement made after 22nd October could achieve that object. y' Apart from possible fucure Russian reactions the only remaining point of interest lies in para (e) and the degree of seriousness which need be attached to -ut. .That a strongly nationalistic feeling about her oil resources has arisen in Persia is a tenable theory* That Persia, woefully short of money, especially in view of her development schemes, is casting about for new sources of revenue is a fact. The theory most widely accepted is that she may have hoped to forestall Russian resentment by this announcement of her intention to secure a modification m her favour of the terms of the A.I.O.C. concession. 5 ' . the closing stages of the Majlis debate Abbas Iskandari (fiamadan - nrmnaliy Demo.rat, but alraost certainly still of the Tudeh faith) insisted on the adaxtion of another clause to Dr Shafaq's bill demanding the rendition of Bahrein to Persia.

TEHRAN. SECRET. 4th November, 1947* MILITARY ATTACHE'S INTELLIGENCE SUMMARY No. 43 FOR THE PERIOD ENLED 4th NOVEMBER, 1947. PERSIAN AFFAIRS. Political. In P ara 2 last Intelligence Summary it was stated that Qawam-us- Saltaneh*s prestige had soared as the result of his handling of the Russian oil question. From that, however, no deduction should be made to the effect that added prestige implies continuance in office in a country governed, not by policy but by personal intrigue, and among a people swayed more by rhetoric than logic. There are many reasons for which Qawam might fall, far-fetched as they will seem to anyone unacquainted with the illogicality of the Persians. Firstly, he has been successful - brilliantly and unexpectedly successful - and success it self in a land so accustomed to failure becomes at once the object of envy. Secondly, this success, in general, and his clever portrayal of himself as Persia*s saviour, in particular, will increase the jealousy and suspicion which the Court party is known to harbour towards him. Thirdly, it must be realized that the overwhelming majority (of 102 to 2) which the Majlis gave him was not given in respect of his past achievements, his present policy or his promises for the future, but was given for the sole purpose of dealing a swift and decisive blow to the Russian oil demand. To a Persian there would be nothing illogical in declaring null and void the past undertakings of a Prime Minister and subsequently proceeding to impeach him in respect of those under takings. . Fourthly, and this may well prove to be the chief cause, the Persians are much given to change for the sake of change, even if the change be one for the worst and, in their opinion, twentyone months of office and of the enjoyment of the fruits of office constitute a fair innings. Lastly, an idea seems to prevail that v/hile the astute Qawam may have been the ideal leader of the country during its recent crisis over an external affair, he is too old, too conservative and too much implicated in the malpractices of his supporters to give a fearless and vigorous lead to the solution of the chief problem remaining one of internal reform of every branch of governmental activity. In the mean*- while his opponents are busy spreading rumours that he is sick and would be only too glad to lay aside the burden of office. The Majlis. 2 * . The incidence of three Persian holidays during last week has resulted in less work but more intrigue. An innocent bill to provide funds for the official charitable institution, 'The Red Lion and Sun Society”, by levying a surcharge on registered mail, telegrams and parcels was introduced by e Minister for Posts, Telegraphs and Telephones, but encountered considerable opposition at its second reading, opposition directed, it is thought, not against the bill as such but against the continuance in office of the Prime Minister.

Political. 1♦ There is but little evidence on which to reassess the strength of the Prime Minister's position in comparison to the previous week. The activities of Reza Hikmat, Saroar Fakhir, the President of the Majlis, have increased but it is too early to say whether he has succeeded in obtaining sufficient support to enable him to stand as a successor to Qawam for the premiershipo He has shewn himself to be a skilful manipulator of the Majlis but he lacks moral principles and is, moreover, in the pocket of the Qashqai as his estates lie at their mercy. Virulent and scurrilous press attacks against Qawam continue. Most Persians believe that these are instigated by the Court and their effect has been opposite to that intended. They do not attract support for Qawam as a person who is being unjustly slandered but they do alarm many people who see in them increasing evidence of an intention on the part of the Shah to discredit Qawam, his cabinet, the Majlis and the existing form of government in general* The Majlis. 2 * ^ _ At its session on 9th November the Majlis passed the credentials ol Hasan Mukarram elected for Darajaz, and on 16th November those of Abbas I azili and Muhammad Herat! from Yezd. A budget bill received its first reading and was sent to the Finance Sub-Committee. A bill for the exemption of agricultural machinery from customs duty was also introduced and a private members bill for the better control of the Press. The Prime Minister expressed himself as ready to reply to the interpclla.tion of Rahiniyan but this was not pressed as the author had absented himself on tho pretext of sickness. During the week a notable speech was made by Hasan Taqizadeh, lately Persian Ambassador in London, bis first public utterance since his return. He made trenchant criticisms of the unwieldy size of the various government departments; the.hordes of unnecessary officialsj tho prevalence of corruption duo, largely, to inadequate salaries; nepotism; the venality of the ruling classes; the glaring inequalities in the distribution of the country's wealth and the unjust incidence of a form of taxation which fell upon essential commodities* It was a courageous speech and full of good sense but it will not further his chances of attaining to the Premiership or even the Speakership. It was not sufficientiy leftish to gain him the good graces of the Russians or the Tudeh who would re quire.much more than that to cause them to overlook his recent opposition to their.oil demands and his diplomatic associations with 'reactionaries and imperialists'. The right, on ./hose support Taqizadeh must roly for election to either of those high offices, will be shaking in their shoes at his references to their venality and their preponderant wealth and will see in him an avatar of Dr Millspaugh — that evil minded man who had the temerity to propose that wealthy Persians should pay income tax. /INTERNAL SECURITY2- * / . '' .i /■ . ; » •; kmtf* INTERN AL SE CURITY . General. 3* During the past week H.M f s Consuls at Shiraz, Kermanshah and Tabriz have v een informed by the local Persian authorities that certain restrictions have been placed on the residence and movement of foreigners. In para 11 of Int: Sumy: No*34 reference was made to the Chief of the General Staff’s intention to lay down prohibited i^ones along the Iraqi-Persian and Turcc-persian frontiers. In conversation with the C.G. S on 12th November the B.M.A. learned that in fact a prohibited belt has been proclaimed encircling the whole country.. The places through which it runs are as follows:-* Khci, Marand, Tabriz, Eostanabad, Sarab, Pahlevi, Gurgan, Gunbad-i~Qabus, Bujnurd, Quchan, Meshed. Turbat-i-Sheikh Jam, Neh, Zahidan, Sirjan, Jahrum, Eazerun, Pahliyan, Behbehan, Ahwaz, Khurramabad, Shahabad, Sennendaj, Saqqiz, Mahabad, Reza.ieh, and so back to the starting point at Khoi. The area lying between this line and the frontier constitutes the prohibited belt. The C.G.S. assured the B.M.A* that the convenience of the A.I.O.C. had been considered and that for travexlers entering Persia by road, the ordinary entry visa on their passport would suffice for a pass to traverse the prohibited zone.. The O.C.S. went on to justify the measure by describing the improper activities of the Russian Vice-Consul at Maku in contacting the local tribes arid gave the well-worn assurance that it was not directed against the British e,nd that only the need for strict impartiality had forced him to extend the belt around the whole country. If. said the C.G.S., there were any suggestions which the B.M.A. had to make he would be very pleased to amend the instructions. The B.M.A. mf.de the following observations;— (a) That if the Russian consul had misbehaved himself the more sensible course would have been for the Persian Government to ask for his removal and, if the offence was repeated by his successor, to ask that the consulate bo closed. To permit the existence of a foreign consulate and then to restrict the consul’s movements to a stone's throw from his residence appeared illogical. A taste for exploration, an interest in antiquities, a desire to get to know his district and the type of life led in it, sport, the return of social calls on prominoi. personalities, wore all legitimate reasons for a. consul’s journeysc ji was not where ho wont but what he did was the important factor: (b) That the putting into effect of this order by provincial military authorities before foreign diplomatic missions had been informed of its issue by the HP.A. was both incorrect and discourteous: (c) That only after careful perusal of the text could H.M's Embassy make their observations on it. J .ill; « 4‘ _ The C.G.S. informed the B.M.A. on 12th November that, as the camp at Badrabad in Luristan v/as full, further rounding up of the Azerbaijan 'muhajirs” had ceased. A commission had been assembled in Khuzistan under the Presidency of the Governor-General to examine the possibilities of settling the muhajirs on some vacant - c -nd near Hindian (South of Behoehan). /BAKHTIARI ,.-3- ^ t ^ report which emanates from ^ Bakhtiari Khan in bitter enmity to Afcul Qasim and which, therefore, should not be regarded as entirely reliable, states that several of Abul Qasim*s enemies, enraged at his reappointment as Governor, have assembled near Behbehan and armed their followers to a total of two or three thousand with a view to opposing Abul Qasim's return.

Political* The Persian Government in a note dated 24th November replied to the Soviet Ambassador's note of 20th November (see para 1 of last IntiSumyi)• ^ set cut to refute the arguments used in the Russian nrte by making three main points. Firstly, Qawam-us-Saltaneh had net evaded his undertakings in presenting his report to the Majlis for he was in duty bound to report all his negotiations to that body before they could have the semblance of legality. Secondly the delay was no fault of his. The Majlis could not come into being till the elections were completed and the elections could not be begun till order and tranquillity were restored to the country (a nicely veiled allusion to the Russian sponsored rebellion in Azerbaijan). Thirdly, the charge of discrimination could not bo upheld against the Persian Government since, according to the law just passed, they proposed to sell their oil to the Russians and to forbid all future foreign concessions, thus dispelling any Russian fears of a foreign concession near her frontier. 2 . The Prime Minister's position has not improved. Evidence cf the growing hostility of the Majlis is afforded by the obstruction shewn by the deputies, excepting a hard core of his supporters from among his Democrat Iran party numbering some 45* ®ny Q^d every moasure brought forward by the Government. The refusal to vote money is, naturally, the most crippling blow to the Government. The .Hostility of the Court party to the Prime Minister is as Implacable as ever. More recently Sardar Fakhir, the Speaker, interviewed by journalists representing papers hostile to the Prime Minister, not only allowed criticism *f the P.M. and his party, to the Chairmanship of which he has just been elected, to remain un answered but actually promised to take independent action to redress their grievances# He is reported to have gathered round him some thirty disgruntled members rf the party v/ho, together with some thirty 'independents” and others in opposition may amount to sixty odd — a number large enough to ensure an opposition majority powerful enough to bring all Government business to a stand still and force the Prime Minister to resign.

The Finance Minister had failed to secure support for the passing of the budget as a whole as, in the opinion of the deputies, this would have been interpreted as a blanket sanction for all the extra expenditure incurred by the Government as a result of the financial effect of the numerous decrees issiXJd by it during the period when no Majlis was in being. Some other proposals were made and then withdrawn and finally, after much discussion, the Majlis passed a purely stop*-gap measure authorizing the payment of ordinary and extraordinary expenditure and the salaries of Government officials up till 22nd December on the basis of the expenditure incurred during the period 24th September - 23rd October of this year. /internal security-2- V4G r lA&amp;) ivy INTERNAL SECURITY, Azerbaijan* , , + „ .

The proposed speech was, however, delivered by the P.M. in the form of a broadcast* 3* The Prime Minister’s broadcast of 30th November was a lengthy one. He covered most of the ground covered in his previous speeches but dwelt on the necessity for national unity in the present crisis. He was at pains to disprove any hostility on the part of the Persian Government, towards the Soviet Government either in their recent actions or in their present policy. The most interesting points v/ere his references to the A.I.O.C. concession and Bahrein. Regarding the former he actually stated that talks in respect of the concession were in progress and in respect of Bahrein he said that it was an inalienable part of Persian territory and that he would make every effort to restore it to the motherland. His reference to the concession was a mis-statement* No talks on a revision of the concession are in progress though more than one member of the recent cabinet has let it be known that the Persian Government v/ould welcome some financially helpful gesture on the part of the Company. The P.M’s reference to Bat-rein is also strange in that on a previous occasion he had personally intervened, in order to eliminate a reference to this subject in the single article bill passed by the Mtajlis when rejecting the proposal for a joint Russo-Persian oil company.

' &lt;© M ILI TAR Y A TTACHEis ETTEL LIGEKCE SUMMARY PERS IA N O, 50, Por_ pe rio d ending 23rd^ Dec ember^ 1947 , POLITICAL. 1 . Persia is still without a government# On 15th December Sardar Hekmat was summoned by H#I#M# The Shah, as a result'of the voting in the Majlis reported in para 3 of my last summary, and was told to form a now cabinet. After apparently agreeing to form a cabinet and giving considerable time and thought to its composition, Sardar Hokmat changed his mind and on the evening of 18th December informed the Shah that ho had boon unable to form a government. The Maj lis therefore had to reconsider the question of prime minis tor. After several mootings a vote for choice of P.M. was taken in the Maj lis on the evening of 21st December, This resulted in 54 votos in favour of Mr Ibrahim Eakimi and 53 in favour of Dr Mossadegh, Mr Hakimi is therefore now attempting to form a government. 2 , Hakimi (F.0.55) is now 77 years of age. He hold the appointments of Minister of Finance and Minister of Education several times between 1910 and 1920. He was twice prime minister for very brief periods in 1945. 3 # There appear to bo more than one reason for the hesitation and ultimate refusal of Sardar Hoknat to form a government. The 1306 (1927) Act forbids members of the Majlis to take up a government appointment earlier than'three months after resigning from the Majlis. Sardar Hoknat, therefore, as President of the Majlis, was not by lav/ eligible for the post of ^imo hinirftor. Various ways of getting round the law, or amending it, are believed to have been considered by th:; Majlis and others, but it may well bo that Sardar Hokmat did not wish to start as prime minister open to the accusation of having boon instrumental in bonding the law for his own purpose. A further, and very probable reason advanced for his refusal is that whon ho got down to the task of selecting his cabinet ho found it oxtromoly difficult and mot with considerable opposition. It nay havo bocono apparent to him that ho was not assured of a good majority in tho Majlis and that his government might ho short-lived. In that event ho would bo throwing away the substance of his present excellent position as President of tho Majlis for the shadow of a brief period as prime minister. For ho would have to give up not only —is position as President, in order to become prime minister, but also his seat m tho Majlis, and if his government foil ho would bo left with no position* 4 Qavam was to havo left tho country by air for owitzerland on 20th Deoember, but his departure has boon delayed as .o wants to travel on a diplomatic passport, to which he is difficult as it has to ho approved by a council of Ministers and thoro are no Ministers at presenti It is believed that Qavan will undergo medical treatment in /Switzerland .r tJ v&gt; TO s .

Hakimi (Hakim-e1-Molk) the new Premier, after somewhat lengthy deliberations, during which he retired to the residence of a friend to be free from lobbying and interruptions, presented his Cabinet to the Shah on 28th December. The .composition of the Cabinet is given below:- Dr Sajjadi - Minister of National Economy Mr Mostafa Adi - Minister without Portfolio Mr Ali Mo 1 tamedi - Minister of Roads Dr Sa 1 id Malek - Minister rf Health Mr Mohd Soruri - Minister of Justice Dr Ali Akbar Siyasi - Minister of Education Mr Abul Qasem Najm - Minister of Finance General Yazdan Panah - Minister of War Major-General Aqevli - Minister of the Interior Mohd Ali Varasteh - Minister of Posts &amp; Telegraphs The Ministers of Foreign Affairs and Agriculture will be appointed later. Final decision does not appear to have been reached regarding the Ministry of Labour but it appears that the Minister ef National Economy will for the present be answerable to the Majlis for Labour affairs. 2. The Government programme. Hakimi read out the 10 point programme of a meeting of the Majlis on the evening *f 28th December. The programme, which will later be debated in the Majlis, contains nothing of outstanding interest or originality. In connection with the promise of a strengthening and reform of the security forces of the country it is, perhaps, interesting to note that a soldier has been appointed Minister of the Interior. The programme gives no indication of the line the Government intends to take with regard to the question of the purchase of armaments and the proposed American credit. 3* Qavam 1 s de parture . today(30th December)# Qavam, the ex-Premier, left Iran by air for Switzerland MILITARY. X 4* Renewal of military missicn agreement with U.S.A. N .Jr / Statements emanating from various foreign sources on the renewal of the military missicn agreement botweenPersia and U.S.A. have attracted considerable attention in the Press and resulted in various rumours and incorrect reports. The agreement has been referred t« as a 'military pact' concluded by Qavam with the object of favouring America,- Certain papers said that the pact was against the constitution and that the Majlis should reject it. The general impression given was that some new agreement had been concluded. The Persian Ministry of War then issued a statement to the effect that that it was merely a routine renewal of the agreement already existing. /5/Note • • « 5* Press p-ttaok on C»G-»S« There have recently been some attacks in a section of the Press An Army authorities. This was followed by the suppression of T ATBSH / ^Xinunique issued by the Tehran military governor stating that certain articles wox^-.contrary to public order and security. The paper f TEHRAN AHROUZ’ (appearing for ‘ATESH’) then attacked General Razmara, the C.G.S. , making various allegations against him and describing him as 'more dangercus than Qavam'*. This resulted m the suppression of that paper also. In a declaration issued by newspaper editors rn 22nd December the new cabinet is urged to abolish military government. 6 . The new Minister for War. General Yazdan Panah is about 56 years of age, speaks Russian and has a Russian wife.

Reference para 5 of IntiSumy* No.50 the British Consul Ahwaz ^ reports that the authorities are •bliging farmers of Luristan to employ some of the 'muhajirs” released from Badrabad camp. The Governor-General, states the Consul is unhappy about the release of these 'muhajirs' and their wide dispersal as it will be difficult to keep an adequate check or control on their activities, and they may be made use of by Russian agents to cause trouble. All those ^ released from Badrabad, however, are supposed to have been screened as whice-. It can, moreover, be argued with some logic that a wide dispersal of possi le . trouble-makers may greatly diminish the chance of any concerted subversive action, particularly if, as is intended, the active subversive elements are kept confinee. 8 . Azerbaijan. There is nothing to report on Azerbaijan. The C.G-.S. told the B.M.A. on 30th December that the situation remains quiet. INDIAN &amp; PAKISTAN INTERESTS. 9* Jinnah 1 s birthday . A reception was given by the Pakistan Embassy «n 26th December in honour of Jinnah’s birthday.

Owing to the absence of the M.A. on tour, this is the first of his intelligence summaries to be issued this year. It therefore covers briefly the more important matters which have occurred in Persian affairs since the beginning uf this year. POLITICAL. 'I • Vote of confidence in P.M. On January 7th the Majlis gave a vote of confidence to the new P.M. by 76 votes out of 92. One vote was cast against him and there were 15 abstentions. 2. Provisional budget. The next matter of importance to come before the Majlis was a short law authorising expenditure for the last 3 months of the year (i.e. up to 21 st March) to be continued at the present rate* At the same time everything possible was to be done to economise. The debate on this measure took over a week and provided members with an opportunity to range over a wide field in their speeches and to criticise almost every activity of the administration. Finally, after considerable pressure from the G-overnment, and amid scenes of disorder, it was passed by a big majority (94 votes out of 100 ). It appears that it is the G-overnment’s intention to work new, in collaboration with the Finance Committee of the Majlis, on the preparation of a new budget for the forthcoming year (1327) and to try to got this passed by the Majlis before the expiry of the authority for the expenditure given by the law referred to above. 3• Bahrein and the A.I&gt;0.0. As was to be expected, frequent references were made during the debate on the provisional budget, to Persian claims to sovereignty over Bahrein and to the alleged iniquities of the terms of the existing concession of the A.1.0.0. The replies made from the Government benches were generally evasive and did not gc beyond assurance that the Government had these matters under careful consideration. Meanwhile discussion of the Bahrein question in the local press has been stimulated by the arrival in Toluan cf a man named Abdullah Zirah who is posing as the accredited representative of all 'Bahreinis' in Persia and the champion cf the return of their lost island to the bosom of the Mother Country.

Mr Anthony Eden arrived in Tehran by air on the afternoon of 1st January, an^xftcr staying two days with the British Ambassador departed for Abadan. As thb guest of the A.I.O.C. he made a tour of the oil fields and installations in South Persia and after a visit to Arabia and Bahrein finally left Persia on 17th January* His arrival in this country gave rise to a flood of speculation and comment in the Press, there being considerable competition as to who could attribute the most fanciful mo+ive for his visit. The prize perhaps is due to the member of the press who suggested that Mr Eden might fill the vacant post of Foreign Minister in the Persian Cabinet. 21. Visit of Admiral Palliser. Admiral Sir Arthur Fassel Palliser visited Tehran from 14th to 16th January. APPOINTMENTS. 22* Civil.

Y 7 ith the object of promoting •ooperation between members of the Majlis and Cabinet, the Prime Minister has decided to meet the Deputies once a week for friendly discussion. The first of these meetings on 7th February was attended by only some Deputies. This poor attendance may be a sign of declining support for Hakimi’s Government. 5* Cabinet posts.

His assailfnt, as far as is known, has not yet been found in sprte of oonsxderablo popular oiamour for immediate action on the part of the Government and police. yassoud had been violently opposed to Qavam's government and at one time offered 20 million rials for the former Premier's head. His paper was thereupon suppressed and liassoud went into hiding, but emerged again on the fall of Qavam. Hassoud's paper was extremely critical and outspoken and it is prob that he had many enemies. His murder caused considerable excitement and hysterical outbursts in the Press, all sections of which are agreed that it had a political motive, though a number of different theories have been advan.-d as to exactly what that motive was. Expressions such as ’’political terrorism , 'enemies of freedom', 'dictatorship”, figured largely in articles on the assassina tion. In its final edition Massoud's own paper suggested the murder was the result of a recently published article by him strongly opposing the re-introduc- tion of the veil# 2 * Interpellation of the Governraent. The government has been interpellated on the murder of Fassoud and general insecurity. In accordance with normal procedure, after the Prime iinistor has given the Government reply, a vote of confidence is called for. interesting to knew whether the opposition in the 1 ajlis has yet grown strong enough to defeat the Government. 3 . Acquittal of Ali Soheilli. Ali Soheilli, a former Prime Minister, whose trial opened in the Criminal Court on 16th February, has now been acquitted of the charges brought against him. These charges were interference in the elections, illegal purcha.se of Government property and suppression of the Press.

On 17th February the Majlis, by 79 votes to 6 , approved the bill for the 10 million dollar American loan and purchase of a.rms from the U.S.A. Russian opposition to the bill has given it more importance than it would otherwise have had. The leftist press, particularly the Tudeh party organ, has voiced s rong criticism of the Majlis in passing this bill which it is said plaoos Persia the Anglo-Saxon camp.•2- jX 5 * Additional troops at Oaspian ports* /I Certain troops additional to the normal garrison are believed to have been sent to the southern shore of the Caspian recently with the object of preventing infiltration of Russian sponsored emigres by way of Russian ships. This may connect with the move of two infantry battalions from Ahwaz referred to in J-f* J , 0 W S ^ ar y No. 2. The Persian C.C.S. confirmed to the M.A. on 3rd Fo&gt;^uary that detachments of troops had been posted at those places on the Caspian eoast where the Russians are in the habit of landing fish, to see that no one is illegally put ashore and that other regulations are not contravened. 6 * Conviction of General Darakshani. General Darakshani, ex commander of the 3rd Persian Division, who surrendered to Pishivari's puppet government in Azerbaijan 2 years a*o. has been sentenced to 13 years hard labour by a military court. g INTERNAL SECURITY. 7* Fire at RESHT. -, 4 . 0r ! 4 , th f ebruary a firc brote out in Denocratic party HQ at Rosht, undcr^ontrol 1 WhlCh &amp; nuBbor of 3 ho P s warc destroyed before the fire was brought .

(Reference para 2 of M.A’s Simmary No.3) Following the debate in the Majlis on the interpellation of the G-overnment, the Prime Minister on 26th February made a brief statement and asked for a vote of confidence. The results of the voting were as follows:-' Votes for the Government 53 Votes against the Government 4 Abstentions 43 In accordance with Persian law, to obtain a majority more than half the votes of the total members present are necessary (i.o. a minimum of 52 votes was necessary in this case). The voting therefore gave the Government an extremely narrow majority. There is no doubt that the position of the Government is shaky. Though it has often been somewhat violently criticised in the Press, mainly on account of weakness, a few influential papers continue staunchly to support Hakimi and there have recently been signs of some rallying of support in his favour amongst various parliamentary fractions in the Majlis. It is possible that instead of the fall of the Government, which many appear to expect in the near future, some changes in the Cabinet may be made. 2. The Majlis. On 2nd March there was an unseemly brawl in the Majlis following angry words on the subject of the validity of the credentials of Mr Kohbcd, deputy for Shahriar. Several members attacked and injured Batman Qalitoh, deputy for Ardebil, and the Speaker was una.ble to restore order. 3* Re-action to events in Czechoslovakia. Considerable interest has naturally been aroused in Persian circles by recent^events in Czechoslovakia, the importance of which appear to have been appreciated as much in this as in other countries. A number of Persians in influential spheres seem, not illogically, to think that when matters have been settled with Finland Russia may turn her maih. attention to Persia in her effort to complete her ring of satellites. Referring to this, in conversation with the M.A. recently, the Persian C.G.S. said that he did not expect Russia to resort to an armed invasion of Persia but to attempt to stir up trouble amongst the tribes and to increase the underground activity of the Tudeh party, following this up, when the time was ripe, by large scale infiltration. MILITARY. 4* Ashouradeh islands. At the beginning of this year there were various rumours current in the press regarding Ashouradeh island, it being suggested that it was occupied by /Russian/of. , DO - 2 - Russian troops. There is actually a chain of 3 small islands across the openin K of Astorabad Bay into the South East corner of the Caspian Sea. According to the Perc n C.&amp;.S. there has been a garrison of one platoon of the Persian Amy on the biggest of these islands for the last few months. This is in keepina with the os ablishing of small military^posts (usually also with a eustoms officer) along the Southern coast of the Caspian Sea, referred to in para 5 of M.A's Sunnarv No t on^L isSnd ' 80 8 fi3hinS P ° St ° f ^ RU3Sian 0OntrOlled Caspian fishing^cSnpany ^’ 5* Amnesty.
