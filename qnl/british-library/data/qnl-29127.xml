Notwithstanding this fact it would appear that in practice the subjects of these Sheikhdoms are treated as British protected persons - i.e. they come within the jurisdiction of the Order (see Sir T. Fowled d.o. letter 116-S dated 13th February 1936). Theory, therefore, seems to be at variance with practice, and it is for consideration if some amendment is called for. (this seems to be the Koweit situation in reverse). Law to be applied 1. Article 11(2) does not specify any particular adaptations or modifications to the application of the Indian Merchant Shipping Act 1923, the Indian Christian Marriage Act 1872 and the Births Deaths and Marriages Registration Act 1886. 2. The Schedule makes specific mention of the Provincial Solvency Act 1920, and adopts a slightly different formula in referring to the Indian Merchant Shipping Act 1923. These features are peculiar to the Muscat Order in Council and result from amendments suggested by the Government of India in 1939. It is for consideration whether they should not also be incorporated in the revised Orders for the other Arab Sheikhdoms. Article 29(iv) (Trucial States Order Article 27(4).) The words n or as a libel on such Court or the Judges thereof, or the administration of justice therein^ P2 (i-3 &lt;*0 /3'7 itnvjrI %i7 /3^ 1»4 ury)? which appear in the corresponding Articles of all the other Persian Gulf Orders have been omitted from the Muscat Order. These words were dropped during the revision of 1939 on the ground that 'they seem to involve a somewhat unnecessary and unwise extension of the carefully limited powers of summary punishment for content, and do not relate to anything which Indian Law recognises as punishable if done in relation to a High Court in British India”. Presumably this argument still holds good, and it is, therefore, for consideration whether this , amendment should not now be incorporated in the other Persian Gulf Orders.No. E 175/175/910 i FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l. 30th January, 1940. My dear Roche, The other day you told me that the attention of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs had been drawn to the Muscat Order in Council of the 25th July, 1939, and that it seemed to the Ministry that by this Order in Council His Majesty’s Government had incorporated, or purported to incorporate, the territory of the Sultan of Muscat in the Indian Empire, 2, I write to assure you that nothing was further from the intentions of His Majesty’s Government in issuing this Order in Council, which is only meant, as I explained to you at the time, to lay down the manner in which the extra-territorial rights enjoyed by The King in the territory of the Sultan shall be exercised on His Majesty’s behalf. There is no essential difference between the new/ Monsieur Louis Roche.new Order in council and the Muscat order in council of the 3rd February, 1915, of which I attach a copy for convenience, and the words which you quoted to me from the preamble ('whereas by treaty, capitulation, grant, 'usage, sufferance and other lawful means His Majesty 'has Jurisdiction within the territories of the Sultan 'of Muscat and Oman') are common to all extra-territorial Orders in Council. 3. The new Order in Council has been made necessary by the conclusion on the 5th February, 1939, of a new Anglo-Muscat Treaty of Commerce and Navigation (Cmd.6037). The 1939 Treaty differed substantially from the previous Treaty of the 18th March 1891 by its fuller recognition of the Sultan's sovereign rights, and did so in two ways - (a) the Sultan's financial autonomy was admitted by the substitution of 'most-favoured nation' privileges for the previous specific limitation on the Muscat customs tariff (Article 5); and (b) in place of the complete extra-territorial rights/rights previously enjoyed provision was made for the application hy His Majesty’s Consul to British subjects of all Muscat laws and regulations which it is desirable to apply to them (Article 15). The changes of detail rendered necessary by the new Treaty in the procedure laid down in the 1915 Order in Council were effected by the issue of the Order in Council which has come to the notice of the French Government* 4* In the opinion of His Majesty’s Government the international status of Muscat remains entirely unchanged by the Treaty of the 5th February, 1939, and the Order in Council of the 25th July, 1939.

Roche, of the French Fmbasey, told me today that the French Embassy har' received s despatch from ^aria which said in effect that it hod been brought to the notice of the Quai d’Orsay th^t an Order-in-Council had recently been issued which incorporated the territory of Muscat in the Indian Empire. 2* I gatherer th&lt; t the attltu e of the French Government was that they did not 'ecessarily believe that this was true, but th» t If it were true the^r feeling was one of sorrow rather than anger. They were willing, in view of the closeness of their relati ns with His Majesty’s Government to assist them in any way they could in consolidating their position in Muscat. But having regard to the interest they had always displayed in this question in the past, they felt thst His Majesty’s Government might hrve consulted them beforehand. 5. I told M. Roche th’t there must be some mistake. We hod ex-territorial rights in Muscat, and from time to time Orrers-in-Council were Issued giving directions ns to the manner in which these rights should be exercised. But I was positive that nothing had been done which in any way altered Muscat's international position. 4. M. Roche said that he too felt sure there had been some mistake.

The views of the local authorities are desired on the Question of retaining the Article in whole or part. It may be that para (a) is still of value. when the .article was proposed in 1013 it was stated by the 'o-’itical Resident (vice enclosure to Government of India Foreign Department despatch No. 108 of the 16th October 1913) to embody the provisions of Muscat King’s Regulation Nr. l of 1903 ”which have worked satisfactorily for the past ten years and which have served materially to reduce litigation regarding land or household property, by providing for an effective system of registration of changes in ownership thereof. ,r If the retention of para (a) is desirable it might be retained and para, (b) simply omitted, as in the draft? 16 and 82. Some doubt has been felt as to the necessity for retaining these articles, since both the Political Resident and the Political .wgent have consular authority (and this will i esumaDiy remain true in the event of the transfo: of the Residency to Bahrain) and therefore already have the powers referred to in these .Articles. -Liiis is suoject to scrutiny by the Government of India.

Printed by His Majesty's Stationery Office Press, Pocock Street, S.E.i.(2)/ unsatisfactory, and I would suggest going a good deal further than is done in paragraph 2 of the draft towards a decision to abandon it. So far as the first alternative is concerned (theSecretary of State, or the Governor-General with his previous sanction), I can see no point or advantage whatever, granted that the matter in question has got to be referred to the Secretary of State, of. gi-rittg TPV aa. alternative as—to the authority who is in form to record the decision. So far as that alternative is concerned the obvious course seems to me to adopt either the Secretary of State or the Governor—General according to the nature of the matter. As regards the alternative of the Governor- General with the Secretary of State's subsequent assent, I suggest that this might well give rise to serious legal difficulties as to what is to happen in the case of an Order passed by the Governor-General, and acted upon, which the Secretary of State subsequently refuses to assent to. In such a case, to make the matter watertight, there ou^it I suggest to be a provision on the lines of that included at the end of paragraph 85(1), but nowhere else. I can see no merits in this arrangement at all, and if the conditions are such that Orders frequently have to be passed by the Government of India without time for previous reference to the Secretary of State, then I suggest that the obvious course is to empower the Governor-General to pass them without qualification.Minute Paper.

The first 2j lines seem to me very obscure. ”Notwithstanding” presumably means 'Notwithstanding anything in the previous provisions of the sub-paragraph'. There X, is nothing in Chapters XVI to XXIII of the Indian Penal Code which specifies what cases are triable by what classes of magistrate: presumably the Cf sense intended is in any case which, under the provisions of the Second Schedule to the Indian Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, is triable by a magistrate of the second or third class. 11 In the seventh line of the same sub- paragraph (page ll) the word 'suits' seems inappropriate with reference to criminal complaints and trials. ( 5 ) Paragraph 20 . The second sub-paragraph seems to follow oddly on the first, and almost to require running on with it as part of the same paragraph. ( 4 ) Paragraph 23(1) . 'authority in that behalf being hereby given to him' seems an unusual form for the conferment of specific power. (5) Paragraph 26(1) . Is there any particular point in requiring the Court to pass the particular Order referred to in this sub-paragraph 'under its seal'? There seems to be no other similar requirement in the Order. (6) Paragraph 30(l)(iv) . I doubt whether the words 'or as a libel on such Court or the Judges thereof' relate to anything which Indian law recognises as punishable if done in relation to a Hig£t Court in British India. 9/38 A.&amp;E.W.Ltd. Gp.685Minute Paper. Legal Adviser’s Department. I agree that the proposed amendment of Art«18(l) will bring the article into accord with what is intended. In the second paragraph of Art.l8(l), if the somewhat obscure word ”notwithstanding' is to be elaborated in the manner suggested by Sir V.Dawson, I would add the further words which I have inserted in pencil. There are, it must be admitted, various passages in the draft order open to criticism in point of draftsman ship, and I agree with the remarks already made in this connection. As to Art.23(l) I think it should be altered to read somewhat as follows 'Where an offender imprisonment, and the P.R. considers it expedient that the sentence should be carried into effect elsewhere than within the limits of this Order, the offender shall be sent for imprisonment to such place in the Province of Bombay or in some other part of His Majesty’s dominions, protectorates, protected States or mandated territories^ the Government whereof consents that offenders may be sent thither under this Article^ as the P.R. may determine under Sec.7 of the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1890'. As to the clause in Art.30(l) (iv) to which Sir V.Dawson draws attention, this seems to me to involve a sanewhat unnecessary and unwise extension of the carefully limited power of summary punishment for contempt. An act may well be punishable under S.500 of the Indian Penal Code without/without constituting a ground for contempt proceedings* I would add, finally, a small point with reference to Art*17(7), viz* that the exact expression ’’regulations made by the P.A*’’ does not in fact appear either in (6) or in (8)*Present THE KING’S MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTY IN COUNCIL Whereas by Treaty, capitulation, grant, usage, sufferance, and other lawful means His Majesty the King has jurisdiction within the territories of the Sultan of Muscat and Oman: NOW, THEREFORE, His Majesty, by virtue and in exercise of the powers in this behalf by the Foreign Jurisdiction Acts, 1890 and igi3( a ), or otherwise in His Majesty vested, is pleased, by and with the advice of His Privy Council, to order, and it is hereby ordered, as follows: — Part I.—Preliminary and General. 1 .

Throughout the Draft Treaty the worda 'His Highness’' before the word 'Sultan' are omitted. This omission was made of course by the express desire of the Sultan himself and to bring the wording of the new Order in Council as far as possible into conformity with that of the Draft treaty presumably It would be pre ferable to omit throughout the Order the words 'His Highness'• 3. Article 4 of the present Order in Council will be modified as follows*- ?or ease of reference X have numbered the headings of the words and expressions in paragraph 4 of the Order coinnencing with die word 'Administration'' and ending with the word 'Will' from 1 to 25 and have re ferred to them aatoieflnitions' 'ausoa t 4 Aeierence Jeflnltlo^ o.S Delete and substitute*-'Muscat subject' means a national of the ouitan of Muscat and Oman* Heference PsfiniUon Uq. a.

Hot£. A point arises as to shsther ths follow ing words from Article 16 of the Draft Treaty should be added to the above draft of Article of the Order in Council after the words 'His Majesty' i- 'i rovided that if any such person should be charged with a crime the Consul will allow the caarge to be tried by the authorities of the Sultan'.Cg) &lt;s&gt; It appears to we that the addition ia unnecessary sinoe the same effeot it brought about by the second portion of Article 6(2) as found in the existing Order in Council. Keferenoe Article 0(3). Jgote # No doubt this clause will hare to remain though I anticipate trouble with the Sultan if A ever it has to be excercised since f as he has often stated to ae, he does not and will not recognise British jurisdiction in Kusoat over the nationals of any foreign country in the absence of his specific consent in spite of the faot that as the clause provides prior agreement would of course have been made between the Government of the country concerned and His i^&amp;je sty's Government. It is a point for con sideration as to whether it would not be advlsabi* psrmps by exchange of letters to clear up the question with the Sultan. Reference Article 8(4) and (5). I thinx both these clauses can stand in view of Article 16 of the Draft Treaty, iieferenoe Article 44(2) *art V. Delete the words from 'and that he does submit' up to end of paragraph. ftpte . The word suggested to be deleted are puxxllng because they would seem to confer on the Political Agent certain powers (ta icing of Court Fees* cost of a case and damages) on Musoa t e ubject. It is the oustom in the Agency Court not to levy Court Fees on cases filed by h&amp;so&amp;ti versus British and no example of costs or dtumae.or dasages being taken from a Kuscat subject complainant in a case can be traced from the records. Whatever the proper procedure in tnis respect under tbe 1891 Treat/ 1 am con* fident that the Sultan would nerer consent to the exercise of such power oyer his subjects by the Political Agent as would appear to be assumed by the words in question and for this reason 1 suggest they be omitted from the Article in the new Order in Council. If this suggestion is approved the first portion of Ihe sentence of clause 44(2) will require modifying and this might then read as follows t - •Provided that the Muscat subject or person not subject to this order* if so required by the Court* first obtains and filss in ths propsr of lice of the Court the consent* in writing* of the competent authority (if any) on btnaif of his own nation to his submitting his case*. *ef«r«nc« Artlcl. *4U). Delete the words 'who is a subject either of the Sultan or of some other non-Christian power not represented by a Consular Official in Kusc&amp;t”. Rote (a ). Cases against all persona not subject to the Order under the new Treaty would be triable solely by the Muscat Court hence the words to be deleted become redundant.

The consul will post a copy of the law or regulation in his office and the law or regulation shall become applicable to nationals of His Majesty one month after the date on which it is posted. It is, however, understood that at the request of the Sultan in case of urgency a shorter period shall be adopted. 2. (i) In the case of legislation imposing taxes or duties and of municipal or police regulations, the consul will always post the laws or regulations within two weeks of the receipt of the request from the sultan ( or within a shorter period in special cases of urgency) unless the laws or regulations are in conflict with Articles 2, 3, 4, 5, 8 or 1C of the present Treaty. (ii) In the case of legislation imposing customs duties, unless the law or regulation is in conflict with Articles 3, 5 or 6 of the present Treaty, the consul will post the law or regulation immediately upon receipt of the request from the Sultan and the law or regulation shall become applicable to nationals of His Majesty within such period as the Sultan may direct. (iii) The same procedure as in sub-paragraph (l) above will apply in the case of all other lav/s and regulations, unless in any particular case the consul of His Majesty submits to the Sultan serious reasons for the modification/modification of the laws or regulations to render them suitable for apijlication to nationals of Kis Majesty or reasons why such application is unnecessary. In the event of the consul submitting such reasons the Sultan will consider the matter ? and, if he does not see fit to accept the suggestions of the consul, will request that the question of the application of the law or regulation in question should be immediately referred to His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom.f Draft Paper.

Letter from Foreign Office, dated 6th May, ) Sheikhs concerned until the oil 1938.) concessions have been secured; but this need not delay consideration of the terms of the necessary draft Order-in-Council and we suggest that if no objection is seen, a comprehensive draft Order should now be prepared by the Government of India, in consultation with the local Political Authorities, and forwarded to this office for consideration by His Majesty's Government. With reference to the last paragraph of Foreign Office letter of 6th May we agree that consideration should now be given to the question of amending the Bahrein Order-in- Council to bring it up to date, while, as regards Muscat, a new Order-in-Council will in any case be necessary when the new Treaty comes into force. We should therefore be glad if, after consultation with the local Political Authorities, you would let us have your suggestions for bringing the Bahrein Order-in-Council up to date and for the necessary new Muscat Order-in-Council. I am sending a copy of this letter (and enclosures) to Fowle. Sir A. Metcalfe. KCIE., CSI.,MV0., External Affairs Department, Government of India. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) R. PEEL.P.

My dear Gibson, With reference to your letter P.Z.2365/38 of the 25th April we agree that the approach to the Trucial Sheiks on the matter of jurisdiction can be left until the oil concessions are out of the way. As regards the preparation of a draft Order-in-Council for the Trucial Coast we agree that this might now be prepared for consideration, and there seems no reason why there should not be only one for all the Trucial Sheikhdoms. Although any possible simplification in its terms will be welcome we doubt whether in fact much simplification will be practicable, and we think that the Koweit and Qatar Orders will have to be taK.en as a basis. In the meantime our view is that new Muscat and Bahrein Orders-in-Council are more urgent and we venture to express the hope that efforts will first be concentrated on producing these. Yours ever, (Sgd.)
