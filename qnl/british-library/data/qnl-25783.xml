Hy dear Lord Linlithgow, 1 thank Your Excellency for your personal letter of September 16th, on the subject of the employment of military forces on the Frontier during the present War. 2. I accept the Instruction as it stands. It is of great importance, I feel, that the G-overnment of India have recognized that a purely static defence would only defeat its own object. Yours sincerely, Sd. A.E.B. Parsons His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General of India. f' 4 ' IXc €&gt;vAy\&gt;-Y. ‘ '“ll H-\ 10EXTRACT from private le Zetland da 14. I have had a great deal of discussion with the Chief, ■s v and also with Caroe, as to the role of our forces, whether Regular or Irregular, on the Frontier during war time; ana it is pretty clear in the light of our discussion that there is a case for an Instruction from the Government of India to define the position more precisely than at present. I have, in the light of our talks, reached agreement with the Chief and Caroe on the draft of which I am sending you a copy separately and which I have now referred for their comments to Parsons and to Metcalfe.truction s regardinK the employment of Regular and Irregular l 1 ore es on tne North-West Frontie r. ihe Government or India nave nad under their consideration the general and normal military policy to be adopted in dealing with trouble which may arise in tribal areas under our influence on the Frontier in view of the outbreak of war and the existing situation on the Frontier vis-a-vis of Afghanistan. They have approved in the outcome after discussion with the Governor of the North-West Frontier Province and the A.G.G. Baluchistan the following general and normal military policy. That policy will apply to the Regular forces under the control of His Excellency the Conxnander-in-Chief as well as to Irregular forces under the control of H.E. the Governor of the N-W.F.F. and the A.G.G. Baluchistan. A. Hostile_action_bY_Qur own tribes directed against us . (a) The role of all owe forces allotted to Frontier defence will be to maintain our existing positions vis-a-vis our own tribes. (b) The role of these forces will therefore be a defensive one in the main, with the exception that in Waziristan minor offensive action, of a strictly limited nature, may continue to be undertaken if necessary to deal with local hostile action endanger ing our posta and conmunications. B. Hostile action bv our own tribes directed against (a) Any hostile act of contemplated act by our tribesmen against Afghanistan will normally be dealt with by such air action as is suitable to meet the particular situation. (b) The role of all land forces will continue to be a defensive one as in A above, but depending on the circumstances of the case, military assistance may be necessary to enforce political pressure,e.g. by the institution of a blockade or some simialr measure. 2. The Government of India desire in issuing these instructions to make it clear that it is not in any sense their intention that the injunction contained in the preceding paragraph in favour of a general and normal defensive military policy should be construed as an instruction that tegular and irregular forces should abandon the initiative in the normal day to day duties of watch and ward or in dealing with local affairs and affrays.That is in no sense the intention of the Government of India and they desire to make that clear beyond any question whatever.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000466.0x0002b8_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/309</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000466.0x0002b8</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/309</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>PZ 6162/39 'Policy to be adopted during war time in regard to the employment of regular and irregular forces on the Frontier'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1939/1939</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-07-01T22:09:54</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (10 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence for this description commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 12; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>This file contains two copies of a policy to be adopted during war time in regard to the employment of regular and irregular forces on the North West Frontier Province in response to any hostile action directed at the British in tribal areas under their influence.
