These should be absolutely forbidden, in all the schools except schools of the First Stage (Infants' schools). The use of pencils leads to slovenly work, bad handwriting, and waste of money. Ink will be found to be far cheaper. Pencils are unknown in European schools, except for Drawing : the youngest of the children are taught to write with ink from the start. I suggest that your Highness should rule that the use of pencils in all Second Stage and Final Stage schools is strictly forbidden.52 The question of School Discipline. ^ Several of the headmasters spoke to me on the subject of corporal punishment, telling me that there was a strong move, outside the schools, for its total abolition, and giving me their reasons for opposing any such suggestion. I am bound to say that I found myself in complete agreement with their view, which was that if corporal punishment were totally abolished it would soon become almost impossible to preserve in the schools that high degree of discipline without which the best work cannot be expected, either from boys or from masters. In those Middle Eastern educational systems where corporal punishment is absolutely forbidden, the effect upon the less amenable of the pupils is deplorable. They become lazy, defiant, and disobedient, and therefore unteachable. I once asked a high education official why the boys in his schools were not allowed to be touched. He said that the boys were ' too noble to be beaten '. My reply was: ' But not too noble, it seems, to lie, to cheat, and to be insolent to those who are trying to teach them.' I think that if we are to avoid a similar state of affairs in the schools of Bahrain, at any rate on the part of the less tractable of the pupils, we must preserve the one form of deterrent punishment which boys really respect, and that is corporal punishment. Everyone knows that while beating is a most unsuitable, and even a dangerous way of punishing a certain type of boy, there are others for whom it is the best, the most beneficial, and sometimes the only possible form of correction. A good schoolmaster knows instinctively to which category each of his boys belongs, and provided that we institute suitable safeguards I see no objection to the continuance in the schools of Bahrain of this method of maintaining discipline. The safeguards which I suggest are as follows : (1) No teacher except a headmaster shall strike a boy, under any circumstances. (2) The striking of boys with the open hand on the head or on the face—a highly dangerous practice, which may result in injury to the hearing or to the eyesight—shall be absolutely forbidden, to schoolmasters of any rank. (3) No boy shall ever be beaten for any fault arising out of lack of intelligence or lack of ability. (4) Every headmaster shall keep a Punishment Book, and shall enter in it, on the same day, the date, the name of the boy beaten, and details of his offence. (5) It shall be clearly understood, by headmasters and assistant masters alike, that disobedience of the rules about corporal punishment may be considered by the Education Department sufficient ground for instant dismissal. I recommend that your Highness should refuse to agree to any request for the abolition of corporal punishment, but should order that it may only be administered strictly in accordance with the above rules.53 We now come to the very important question of School Books. It will be remembered that the absence of suffioient text-books was mentioned earlier in this Report as being one of the seven causes of inefficiency in the schools. I do not know whether it is realised by the Education Department that owing to the rule which requires that books shall be paid for by the pupils themselves, the vast majority of the boys use no books at all, from the beginning of the year to its end, and that even those parents who can afford to provide their children with books neglect to do so. The head master of Hedd School told me that the few boys whose parents buy them books bring to school with them one Arabic reading-book, one English reading-book, and nothing else. In his own words: 'All other subjects are taught without the use of books at all. The teachers dictate.' This is a truly lamentable state of affairs. How can we seriously call these institutions government schools, where there are not even books for the pupils ? One hardly dares to commit oneself to paper on the subject of an Inspector who could allow the schools for which he was responsible to be so conducted. I believe I did hear something about books occasionally being given put free to very poor boys, but if this has happened at all we may be quite sure that it has been only at Manamah and Muharraq, the two show schools. But even if all the poor boys in all the schools were given books free of charge, and if all the richer parents were perfect people, a system under which some boys are able to buy their own books, while others are forced to accept them as charitable gifts, is a most undesirable one, for any school, and I suggest that your Highness should give instruc tions for the present chaotic state of affairs to be brought to an end as soon as possible. I want to suggest that in future all the books needed in all First Stage and Second Stage schools should be bought by the Education Department, and should become the property of the schools, who would be responsible for them, and who would lend them out, free of charge, for the use of the boys during school hours alone. This means that the boys would noit be allowed to take them away from the school premises. Boys can, w th a little training, be persuaded to take great care of printed books, and if my suggestion is adopted the same books will serve the same classes year after year. Generation after generation of boys will use them, and it will be found that very little loss through damage is suffered by the Education Department. I suggest to your Highness that all school books needed by boys of the Final Stage shall be paid for, either by the parents, or, in the case of poor boys, out of their scholarship grants, by the Government.no 54 Before we leave the question of school books, a few words ought to be said on the subject of Translations. The supply of good school books in the Arabic language is very limited, especially as regards books for the very young, and books on mathematics. It is therefore necessary, if we are to get the best results from our schools, to fall back upon translations into Arabic of good English text-books. Those of the Bahrain schoolmasters who are competent to produce really good translations for use in the schools should be en couraged to do so, and should be paid for their work. I suggest to your Highness that instructions should be given to the new Inspector, when he is going into the whole question of school books, to bear in mind the fact that it is far better to use a local translation of a first-class foreign text-book than to rely upon a second-rate book which happens to be already available in the Arabic language. As regards mathematics especially, it would be wise for the Inspector to set about having a translation made immediately, and the English text-book which I recommend for this purpose is Borchardt's School Arithmetic—not the whole of it, but certain suitable sections.55 The Local Printing Press. Now that Bahrain possesses a modern printing-press, the fullest use should be made of it by the Education Department in connection with the supply of books and stationery to the schools. Its resources should be steadily developed until eventually it has become their sole supplier of exercise-books, paper, ink, etc. and the printer of all translations made in Bahrain for school use. It should also print the attendance-sheets, the mark-books, the certificates of education, and other necessary school literature ; and it might in time become the Department's agent for the supply of all school equipment ordered. All this should result in much saving to the Education Department, and it would in any case keep Bahrain money in Bahrain. I suggest that your Highness should invite the attention of the Education Department to the many possibilities of the local printing-press.56 There is one remaining matter of school routine to be dealt with, the matter of the Final Examinations, that is to say, examinations for Educa tion Department certificates. I have carefully studied the examination-papers set for the senior boys last June, and I find, as indeed I half expected to find, that many of the questions, especially those set in the English papers, are childish in standard, and in some cases not tests of language at all, but merely memory-tests, designed, apparently, to find out whether the boys would be able to remem ber quite unimportant details in the stories which they had been reading during the past year. Many of the questions were quite unworthy of a place in any serious examination, other than one set for mere infants. Bahrain is not alone in this matter of unworthy examinations. In some of the other Arab states, schoolmasters who are afraid of seeing their boys fail in the final examinations are giving them, year by year, only the simplest questions, of the kind which they will be quite sure to be able to answer successfully. And side by side with this dishonesty goes a gross overmarking of the answers, designed to ensure that all the candidates shall pass, at whatever cost. In some States this has been going on for so long, and so consistently, that whenever it happens that an honest teacher sets a reasonable examination-paper we have the ridiculous spec tacle of the whole mass of the candidates walking out of the examina tion-room and going in a body to complain to the Ministry of Education that the questions are too hard ! The order then goes forth, either that a new examination shall be held, containing easier questions, or that the correctors shall pass all the candidates. Such a state of affairs of course only brings these educational systems into ridicule and contempt, for it clearly shows that the educational authorities, who frequently refer to them selves as experts, have no real conception of education at all. Worse still, that this sort of thing is going on in the East is quite well known in Europe, and in consequence the great universities of England and France refuse to recognise certificates of education issued by some of the Arab states. This means that an Arab student from any of these states who wishes to enter a good European university is unable to do so until he has successfully submitted himself for a fresh examination in Europe. And so, in the end, it is the student who suffers, for the shortcomings of his seniors. It is much to be hoped that the Education Department will take energetic steps to see that a similar state of affairs does not arise in Bahrain. Whoever is selected to be the new controller of education will have to put up a manful fight against unworthy examinations, and Headmasters, assistant masters, and boys will have to be made to realise that only harm and ridicule can result from the setting of childish examinations by school masters. Elsewhere in this Eeport I have suggested to your Highness that, in the absence of a British director of education, an examiner from outside Bahrain should be engaged each year, and that all the final examina tions should be conducted by him, during a short visit to the Island. If for any reason this suggestion does not find favour with your Highaess, then I suggest that, since the issue to a boy of a Government certificate of education is a guarantee by the Education Department that he has been properly educated, it follows that all the arrangements for certificate examinations ought to be in the hands of the Education Department. I therefore suggest to your Highness that the papers which the boys are to take should be submitted to the Education Department for approval before they are given to the candidates; that the examinations themselves should be conducted by the Education Department, away from the schools ; that57 the invigilators at the examinations should be persons not connected with education ; and finally, that the boys' answers, after being marked, should be scrutinised by the Education Department before any certificates are awarded. If these things are done, we shall have honest examinations, and certificates which are worth possessing.58 The question of Scouting. I am not very much impressed with tha value of Scouting for boys who are already attending a good school. The founder of the Scout Movement has himself told us that he invented the system for the special benefit of poor boys who had no access to organised school games, and no chance of receiving any training in character, either at home or at school. Scouting aims at developing in boys certain definite characteristics, notably self- reliance, physical endurance, powers of observation, the habit of being always prepared for any emergency, and the virtue of helping others, with out reward, on every possible occasion. But all these highly praiseworthy things can equally well be taught by any good school: boys need not put on uniforms to learn them, nor need schoolmasters become scoutmasters in order to teach them. Earlier in this Report I have suggested a very com prehensive scheme of character-training for the Bahrain schools, and if this is adopted I feel that it will make the continuance of Scouting in the schools hardly worth while, since Scouting would then be superfluous. There are, moveover, two serious objections to Scouting as an adjunct to school education. The first is that, owing to the cost of uniform and the necessary equipment, Scouting favours the sons of the well-to-do and puts itself beyond the reach of the very poor, which is, from an educational point of view, an odious state of affairs ; and the second is the ease with which Scouting can be twisted out of its intended course, or original purpose, and made to serve political or even more sinister ends. We have all witnessed, during the past ten or twelve years, and notably in Germany and Italy, the sad sight of perfectly harmless children's organisations being turned into definitely military units. Something of the same sort is going on in at least one of the Arab states to-day. There may be no danger of a similar kind in Bahrain, but, generally speaking, the less we see of uniforms in the schools, the better, especially when uniforms are quite unnecessary. Although I do not hold very strong views on the subject, I rather think that it might be a good thing to abolish scouting in Bahrain altogether, and to rely entirely upon character-training and physical drill. If your Highness considers this to be a good suggestion, I recommend that the Inspector should be instructed to introduce daily physical training into all the schools as soon as possible. The first twenty minutes or half-hour ol each day's routine should be devoted to it, all the year round : but it is of the utmost importance that physical instruction should be given only by those who know how to teach it scientifically, for otherwise the exercises will be of little value. The Inspector should try to obtain for all his physi cal training teachers simple handbooks of instruction, of which many are to be had, in most languages.59 The matter of the School Buildings and Equipment. I understand that there is some public dissatisfaction with the age and condition of the buildings in which some of the schools are at present housed, and that the erection of new and up-to-date schools, with modern equipment, is being asked for. It is too often forgotten by those who demand extensive reforms from governments that reforms cost money, and that money is not unlimited. People are apt to forget, also, how much the Government has already done. I do not advise your Highness to spend money on erecting imposing school buildings, or in the purchase of elaborate equipment. Far more import ant than the outside of a school is what goes on inside it. Education can be imparted in the very humblest surroundings. -There have been many instances, in past times in England, of education of the highest class being given by poor teachers, to equally poor pupils, in stables and cellars. If there is any spare money to be spent on the schools of Bahrain, let it be spent in securing better teaching and modern books, rather than on bricks and mortar, which can do nothing towards raising the standard of education. The building of the three infants' schools, however, I regard as being an absolutely necessary expense—one which will have to be incurred if the standard of education in Bahrain is to be raised, and if the present over crowding of the three town schools is to be remedied. I also think that water should be laid on to Muharraq School, and, if possible, electric light.60 I understand that various people interested in education in Bahrain are asking for the provision by the Government cf School Motor Coaches, to be used for the purpose of carrying the children between their homes and the schools. I consider that the provision of school motor coaches would be a sheer luxury, and therefore a waste of money. Such a step would also go far towards further lowering the already low standard of health among the young people of Bahrain. In England many thousands of young village children walk several miles to school, and back again, every day, and this practice has always been regarded, by parents, schoolmasters, and docto rs alike, as being of the utmost benefit to the health of the children, who in this way obtain plenty of outdoor exercise, without which the instruction given in the classroom could not be properly assimilated. In these days, there is too much riding about in motor-cars by young people, who would derive far greater benefit from their journeys if they made them on foot. For these reasons, I strongly advise your Highness not to consent to the expenditure of any public money on the provision of school motor coaches.61 The Technical School. One of the brightest spots in the Bahrain educational scene was the Technical School at Manamah, which is certainly the most satisfactory school in the Island. Its classes are small, its teachers are experts, and it is providing its pupils with just that kind of training which their future employers will hope to find in them. When I paid a surprise visit to the school, I found everyone busily engaged, and everythiog going with that cheerful swing which betokens the efficient and well-conducted institution. For these reasons I was all the more sorry to hear that only a very small extension of this side of Bahrain education is at present contemplated by the Education Department. In view of the rapidly increasing technical developments which are taking place in Bahrain, I feel sure that this is a mistake. The Oil Company is employing at good rates of pay hundreds of foreigners, whose places could, and would, be taken by Bahrainis, if only the latter possessed the same technical qualifications as the former. I understand that one of the principal grievances of those who are dissatisfied relates to this very matter, and if this grievance is a genuine one, is not the correct answer to it an immediate and substantial increase in the local facilities for technical training ? Quite apart from the Oil Company, there are many local openings of which Bahrain schoolboys could take advantage, if only they possessed the requisite training. The building, plumbing, carpentering, forging, fitting, engineering, and electrical trades of Bahrain are at present in the hands of foreigners, and the entrance to all of them, for local boys, is through the portals of a technical school. I know that many Bahrain schoolboys consider it more genteel to work with a pen in an office, than to work with their hands at a bench or beside a machine. A boy who thinks like this is of course a fool, but his folly is not so much his own fault as that of his school, which has allowed him to develop such unworthy ideas. 1 also know that, owing to shortsightedness of outlook, very few Bahraini schoolboys can be persuaded to ' waste ' a couple of years at a technical school—although the ultimate rewards are high—unless they are paid by the Government to do so. Here again, the schools are to blame, and not the boys. There is something very wrong with our system of education when some of the schoolboys have to be bribed by the Government to undergo training which after a couple of years will secure them high wages, and when others consider that any kind, of manual work is degrading. What is wrong is a lack of unity and mutual assistance on the part of the various schools of Bahrain, and a limited conception of their proper functions on the part of the schoolmasters. We cannot expect to have a plentiful supply of willing pupils for a technical school unless there has previously been an active propaganda in favour of it in all the other schools, designed to bring home to the boys' minds the enormous advantage of the properly trained man over the unskilled labourer. Nor can we expect a right sense of values in schoolboys unless there has been a right lead from the schoolmasters. The proper work of a schoolmaster is not confined to the mechanical teaching of boys from printed books: there are other branches of his craft, such as the firing of youthful imagi nations, the stimulation of youthful ambition, and the fostering of right ways of thought. The schoolmasters of Bahrain might, for example, have described to their boys how in all the great countries of Europe the sons of the rich submit themselves for years to technical training as ordinary mechanics in great engineering works, in order eventually to become skilled engineers; and how the sons of the poor, who have been working all day in humble employment, go at night with their money to the evening schools to buy themselves the technical training which will enable them62 to earn high wages as skilled mechanics. The boys of Bahrain might have been told by the schoolmasters how the builders of the world's great bridges, famous railways, giant liners, and so on, all started their careers in the overalls of simple workmen, and how, even after they had become famous engineers, they were not ashamed to work, side by side with their own employees, with their hands. If only our schoolmasters would speak to their boys on these lines, we should have no shortage of applicants for places at the Technical School. And side by side with this kind of instruc tion should go repeated warniugs and reminders to the boys that it is no part of the duty of the Government to provide boys with employment after they leave school, and that the vacancies in Government offices are strictly limited. I suggest that your Highness should issue instructions for a definite propaganda in favour of the Technical School to be instituted in all the other schools without delay, and also for all the schoolmasters to combine in trying to bring about, by means of quiet talks, a wiser frame of mind in those of their pupils who consider manual work as being beneath their dignity, and a little more foresight in those who are too eager to earn immediate wages as soon as they leave school. I further suggest to your Highness that the whole question of the expansion of technical training in Bahrain should be reconsidered. (There is one serious impediment to the fullest success of the Technical School, and that is the very poor knowledge of mathematics found in the boys who enter it from the other schools. The improvement of the mathemati cal standard in the schools of Bahrain has already been discussed, but I mention the matter again here in order to emphasise its urgent necessity.) f63 A few words ought to be said about the Education of Girls. I found, during my visit to Bahrain, that a personal inspection of the two girL' schools would not be possible, and as I did not think it wise to ba?e any official report upon the unsupported evidence of the teachers, I made no investigation of female education in Bahrain. I was, however, shown some beautiful examples of handwork of various kitids, done by the schoolgirls, and I was much impressed by the high standard of artistry and skill which these displayed. I was also told that much attention is being paid in the girls' schools to the domestic subjects, such as cooking, sewing, and other branches of housekeeping, which is an excellent and most sensible arrangement, and one which ought to be continued. There does just exist, however, a danger of neglecting the literary side of a girl's education, in favour of the domestic side, to such an extent as to damage her chances of marriage later on; for it is being found in those Arab countries which are educating their youth on a wide scale that the young men are showing an increasing distaste for marriage with girls whose education is much inferior to their own. I therefore suggest to your Highness that while the domestic side of female education in Bahrain is of the utmost importance, and should be fully developed, a careful watch should be kept to see that the literary side is not too much neglected.64 Extra-Mural Education. A conception of education which limits itself to the four walls of a classroom and to the subjects of school text-books is a somewhat narrow one. The scope of education is much wider than this, and an alert director of education will find many other opportunities of disseminat ing knowledge. His first duty, of course, will be to the schoolchildren; but an informed youth and an ignorant adult population leads to compli cations which a wider view of public instruction would do much to prevent. There are a number of channels through which knowledge can be conveyed to those who are no longer of school age, but the one which comes first to mind in the case of Bahrain is that of the Police. Your Highness has collected what appears to be a fine body of intelligent and well-disciplined policemen, and the greatest use could be made of them in the education of the more backward of the people in matters of health, hygiene, and sanitation, as well as in civic and other matters; for the highest possible advantage is obtained from a police-force only when its members, besides being the controllers of the public, are also its counsellors, guides, and educators. But policemen cannot be used as educators unless they are themselves educated, and for this reason I suggest to your Highness that educational facilities should be freely extended to the Police by the Education Department, which should never be allowed to consider that its proper functions are confined to the classrooms of the regular schools. Your Highness's British Adviser, under whose tutelage and care the Police have been brought to so high a pitch of efficiency, would be quite the best person to formulate the exact educational requirements of the Police, and it would then be for Education to provide the appropriate teachers and the necessary facilities. I imagine that elementary classes in the English language, for example, would be of the utmost value to the Police of Bahrain, in view of the many English-speaking residents and visitors with whom they now have to deal.65 Next, there are the possibilities of Open-Air Instruction. A great deal could be done, especially in the distant villages, by means of quiet, informal talks to the local people, given by the schoolmasters. It is not a very satisfactory state of affairs when the children are educated and the parents completely ignorant, and nothing but good can result from occasional semi-educational meetiogs between parents and schoolmasters. Such talks should be held in public places, at times when the older people can conveniently attend them. The subjects of discussion can range over a very wide field, from purely local matters, such as health, child welfare, harmful superstitions, better forms of agriculture, etc., to matters of wider interest, such as world history and geography, famous people, and foreign news. No subject likely to raise the general level of knowledge amongst the humbler people of the Island should be disdained by the speakers, who should remember that many matters which may seem commonplace to themselves will be of absorbing interest to their less sophisticated hearers. I suggest to your Highness that the Inspector should be asked to bear in mind the possibilities of open-air instruction for adults, and to try to arrange for occasional public talks by the schoolmasters, especially in the distant villages.17^ 66 Next, there is the Public Cinema. In all the Western countries the Cinema is now being widely used as an adjunct to education, and special educational films are being produced in great quantity and great variety of subject. These can be hired more cheaply than any other kind of film. Now that Manamah possesses a public cinema, there are two ways in which it might be used to great advantage by the Government in furtherance of public instruction. For adult education, the Government might require the owners to include in their programmes a certain fixed proportion of educational films, the choice of subjects to be made by the Education Department; and for child educa tion, the Government might require the owners to arrange occasional matinee performances, solely for children, at which only educational and juvenile films would be shown, and the schoolchildren might be sent to these occasional performances, at very cheap rates, at the Education Department's expense. The installation of the Manamah Cinema seems to me to present the Government with a timely and an excellent opportunity of disseminating knowledge over a wide area at very small cost, and I suggest to your High ness that full advantage should be taken of it without delay. The fullest information about educational and children's films could quite easily be obtained by the Inspector, from London.67 Finally, there is the Local Newspaper. The Press is, of course, one of the most powerful of all educational agencies, and the fullest use should be made by the Education Department of the local newspaper, not only as a means of keeping the public in formed on local educational matters, but also as a vehicle for the spreading of education itself. The Inspector and the schoolmasters should be en couraged to become frequent contributors of informative articles, especially upon such subjects as health, hygiene, sanitation, Bahrain history, and matters of topical interest, both local and foreign. The newspapers of some capitals contain what are called Students' Corners, sections in which all matters of interest to schoolboys are dealt with, usually by a local school master, and this might be a very good thing to introduce into Bahrain. I suggest that your Highness should ask the Education Department to make the fullest use of the local newspaper, both for the purpose of inform ing the public of its views and intentions regarding education, and for the purpose of spreading education itself.68 The question of Educational Finance is not one which comes properly within the scope of this Report, since the purpose of my visit to Bahrain was to examine the educational position only. While I was in the Island, however, a number of people urged upon me the desirability of having the whole of the finances of the Education Department placed under the direct control of the Adviserate. It is not for me to venture to advise your Highness in this matter, as I have not been asked to do so. I feel it my duty, however, simply to bring to your Highness's notice the fact that there is dissatisfaction in Bahrain with the way in which the financial side of Education is at present being managed.69 This brings me to the end of my Keporb, and on reading it over for the last time I find myself wondering whether, in my efforts to give a faithful account of the many present weaknesses of Bahrain education, I have too much neglected the other side, and so presented your Highness with too gloomy a picture of the whole. If I have done this, it has baen very far from my intention, for it must be clear to anyone who goes round the schools that a great deal has already been done for education in Bahrain. While I was making my inspection I noted many pleasing points, made the acquaiutance of many pleasant masters and pupils, and was most favourably impressed by a number of minor but by no means unimportant features, amongst which I might perhaps have mentioned the cleanliness of the boys' clothes, the alertness and intelligence of their looks, the neatness of their Arabic handwriting, the heartiness and tunefulness of their singing, their good manners and courteous bearing when spoken to or questioned, their lack of any kind of shyness or fear, and the general air of quiet order and discipline which prevailed in all the classrooms. I have no doubt whatever that boys of this type can be educated up to a high standard, if only they can be kept healthy, and the right methods are applied. Your Highness was, I think, unfortunate in the choice of the late controller of education—and upon the controller nearly everything depends. I also feel that there might have been a higher degree of success in Bahrain education if the teaching-staff had been able to take a wider view of its duties and responsibilities than that which limits them to the mere imparting of book-knowledge in the classrooms. If we can now supply Bahrain education with a really capable, conscientious, and high-minded controller, willing to adopt the methods outlined in this Keport, and strong enough to carry his teaching-staff with him, it should be well within his powers very considerably to raise the whole standard of education in your Highness's State. But, as this Eeport indicates, there are first of all many adjustments and innovations to be made, and quick results cannot be expected. Several years must elapse before the full benefit of all the proposed changes can possibly be felt, but the improvement, when it comes, will be so striking that I am quite sure everyone concerned will agree that any trouble or dislocation involved by the change-over from the old order to the new was well worth while. In conclusion, I should like to express to your Highness my thanks for the courtesy, hospitality, and generosity extended to me in connection with my visit to Bahrain. I should also like to acknowledge the never-failing interest shown in my work by your Highness's British Adviser, and the assistance given to me by him, in order to enable me to carry it out effectively. I have the honour to be Your Highness's humble and obedient servant, C. K. L. ADMAN-VALLANCE. Baghdad, 1st September, 1939.VX1 Telegram Q. From Political Agent, Bahrain.

S* Although the Council ^feel confident that we may rely upon the money being available in future years' it is a little disconcerting at this stage to find that actual sanction exists only for a single payment of £ 500/-. It is true that previous correspondence from the India Office and the Council does not in so many words promise a recurring grant, but references to the provision of 'a sum of £ 500/- in a full year certainly do not indicate that a single grant was contemplated. The terms of your telegram No. T/385 dated the 21st October 1939 made it sufficiently evident that our object was to obtain Vallance for Bahrain for a period of years and that the Bahrain Government proposed to engage him on the understanding that the British Council would provide a subsidy of £ 500/- per annum . Surely that was the time to warn us that we had misunderstood the situa tion and that the Council could only promise us a single grant. As it is the Bahrain Government have entered into a contract with Mr. Vallance for a period of five years and may claim that in doing so they have been grievously i misled by us. Of course the contract is terminable on short notice but that does not really make our position any the more comfortable. In view of the optimistic forecast in The Hontble Lieut-Colonel C. G.

I now enclose a copy of a report which he has just produced. It is an interesting report and I dare say it will be very useful in due course; but you will see that his ideas are rather too large for Bahrain, and I do not think that Bahrain can possibly absorb as many as 50 trained technical students a year. If this report were followed literally, the State would be involved in non-recurring expenditure of close on Rs. ij lakhs and recurring expendi ture not very far short of Rs. 50,000 annually. These figures are far beyond what can and ought to be soent here. 3. Frankly I am not quite sure yet how the State can best use this report. But as a preliminary I propose to present a copy of it to Thornburg and to invite his Company to make a gift of the equipment listed. The success of this move of course depends largely on the ability of His Majesty's Government to make up their minds about the con cession and the political agreement for the Unallotted Area.

Conelu si on^ 4 ^ 14 f YOUR HIGHNESS, I have the honour to submit my Report on Technical Educat on in Bahrain, together with proposals for the developm nt of a system of technical training which would conf :?m with the economic needs of the State and with tie scheme of education lately intro duced into the I land* I understand that what is desired in Bahrain is a fuller part oipation by your Highness*s subjects in the growing i dustrial life of the State ? end their enjoyment of a 1 ;rger share of the material prosperity which is at pres nt almost the monopoly of foreigners.. I am i: complete agreement with your High ness 1 s conviction that aji early and considerable ex tension of techn cal training is the best means of realising this aiibition, and having lately completed my examination, o. the relevant aspects of industry and education in Bahrain, I am able to lay before your Highness the following considerations and proposals-\(,1&gt; - 6 - rroUS IHlAL INFLUENCES m BAHRAIN . During the past two decades the social and economic life of the countries of the Middle East has been subjected to far -reaching changes, brought about by the introduction of new amenities, new sources of power, and new industrial processes• These changes have, on the whole, been highly beneficial, but they have come about so rapidly that the people of the countries concerned have been unable to acquire a thorough knowledge of the new forces which have so profoundly influenced their livesj and lacking such knowledge, the native peoples of the Middle East have played only a minor part in the new industries and commercial enterprises established in their midst« This condition of things is nowhere more evident than in Bahrain where in recent years the development of building and public works, the introduc tion of mechanical trades into the markets, and above all, the vast activities of the Oil Company, have created a demand for service which could not be met by the untrained and inexperienced local population. Remunerative employment in skilled occupations or in executive posts has therefore been given almost entirely to foreigners who have come to the Island in large numbers, leaving only the unskilled and poorly paid work to the native Bahrain!So If in the future Bahrain subjects are to play an im portant part in modern industrial activity, their training will have to be undertaken without delay, for training takes time, and meanwhile the recruitment of foreigners into industry is con tinuing unchecked. There are various skilled occupations for which the demand is considerable and increasing, and for which the means of training are within the reach of the Education Department of your Highness 1 s Government through the medium of the proposed Technical School. If attention is first given to the careful preparation of Bahrain boys for service as skilled workmen in the mechanical, electrical, woodworking and building trades, their advancement to higher posts in industry ana the Government Departments will follow later as a matter of course,. The problem of providing higher technical training for executive and administrative posts in industry will be easily 1 . provided that elementary industrial training is first established on a sound basis in the State • It is satisfactory that the matter of ' training has already received some attention in Bahrain and that tne small Technical School at Manama has met with a measure 01 success. The scheme of training in this school was conceived generally on the right lines, though various factors m the instruction and organisation have arrested its The results of this initial experiment have enabled me to recom mend the adoption of a considerable extension of tne scheme, fully confident that it could be carried to a successful issue^- 6 the present technical school 4. t ^ b ® eilce of a proper Principal the Technical School at Manama has to some extent come under the supervision of the government ^ngmeer who ? in the limited time at his disposal. has J r ?^ d ^ equipment for the workshops and super vised the praotxeal instruction of the pupils. Due lar-elv to ^rk^nd^ve thu^hp 3 ^*£requ.vntly engaged on actual'industrial v^ork and have thUvS been obtaining the kind of experience they need m the practice of their various trades. It is to the credit of e ve; i?ycme concerned that the Technical School has not wasted much of the time of its pupils on tasks which have little instructional value and which result in the production of quite useless articles* This may account in some measure for the hard work and enthusiasm displayed by the majority of the boys in the schools They appear to realise the usefulness of their work, which they carry out with zest in spite of the numerous difficulties m the way of comfort and inadequacy of equipment, ihe course of training occupies two years, new pupils being admitted at any came of the year, a small number of boys have already completed their courses and appear to be giving satisfaction to their employers. The school is^staffed with three instructors STAFF AND of Syrian nationality, one being responsible for THE TEACHING the metalwork and mechanical side and the other OF HANDWORK, two for the woodv/orking trades. They appear to possess good knowledge of trade practice, but they do not have that method and orderliness which characterises the best crafts men and which is such a valuable element in workshop instruction. Like so many skilled workmen in the east, they ignore the menial tasks connected with the workshops and do not encourage their pupils in habits of cleanliness and order. The absence of serv ants or labourers should not be made an excuse for dirt and un tidiness, especially in places for training young people, The standard of craftsmanship in the school is quite good, considering that the boys do not have well graded exex^cises. This shows at least that the instructors work conscientiously and that the Arab boys in Bahrain, as elsewhere, have a capacity for skilled work. The mechanical engineering instructor includes in his depart ment the whole of the metalworking crafts — forging, fitting, turning, etc* At the present time he has only a small number of boys in his charge 9 but if the school is enlarged he should con fine his activities to one branch only, whichever he is best qualified to take. With a larger number of pupils in the school it should be possible to employ a works instructor for each speci alised trade. In the case of the two woodwork instructors also it would be better if their work were divided so that one became responsible for the furniture trade (cabinet making) and one for building work (carpentry and Joinery), I have elsewhere mentioned the desirability of appointing a third and senior woodwork instruc tor specially qualified to teach beginners and to give proper lessons in woodwork technology and drawing. Some time is devoted in the school to mechanical^ DRAWING, Rawing. The results are poor, mainly because there is not a properly graded course of exercises. The pupils are exxDec- ted to make sketches and scale drawings of complicated machine Parts before, they have any idea of the fundamental principles of geometry- 7 - in teomotry and. projectrion. In these circmns'tajices tiie v/ork can have very little meaning to them, a good knowledge of drawing is absolutely essential to the modern industrial artisan. For this reasoni and in consideration of the fact that the Arab peoples generally have little aptitude for the graphic arts, Instruction in any kind of drawing should be in the hands of an expert teac-her. In the craft work as wall as in the drawing NEGLECT OF there is a tendency to negleot the elementary exer- FOUTOATION oises which require aacuracy in a few aimpi* opera- WORK, tions. Eastern teachers invariably despise element ary work, thinking that advanced exercises, however badly done, indicate a high standard of teaching. Actually it is because of their ooutempt for simple groundwork that so little success attends the efforts of these teachers to give advanced instruction. This has been ably stated by the writer of the Report on Education in Bahrain in connection with academic studies, and what he says applies with double force to the teaching of craft work. PracticaUy the whole of the present school SCHOOli building consists of workshops. The rooms are rather BUIIDING. too small for practical work, particularly woodwork. The woodwork class is congested and confused, not only on account of the lack of space, but also because there are no proper work benches. The only space available for a classroom is a small cubicle intended for use as a store or a masters office. There is as yet no lavatory accommodation in or near the building. I have suggested elsewhere in this Report that the present building could be better used as a line of classrooms and offices, the work shops being transferred to new buildings more suitably proportioned. The tools and machinery used in the school E^UIPMfflT. are of a suitable kind for instructional purposed and trade practice.. They are inadequate, however, even for the present small number of pupils. There is, for example, only one lathe in the engineering workshop and no other machine tools of a suitable type. Although workshop equipment is very costly, the cost per pupil is much less when a large number are undergoing training at the same time. Thus- twenty boys taking a oourse of engineering workshop practice (fitting and machinists 1 work) require very little more equipment than ten boys undergoing the same course, the extra requirements being mainly benches and small tools5 the machines and heavy equipment are nearly the same in both cases. Moreover^ if there are forty boys to be -taught, there could be two classes of twenty working at alternate times and using exactly the same equipment. This consideration does not, of course, apply in the same way to trades in which only hand tools are used, and the scheme of alternate classes cannot be fully operative in a school where more than half the time is devoted to workshop instruction. There is no proper accommodation in the present CLASSROOM Technical School for'class instruction. If subjects INSTRUCTION. su ch as English, arithmetic, and drawing are to be properly taught, there should be suitable classrooms away from the noise of the workshops. Lack of accommodation may be partly re sponsible for the low standard of class teaching in the school, out there is also evidence of school subjects not having been taken seriously, on account of the low educational standard of the ^ys admitted to the school. It is everywhere acknowledged that J^lish and elementary mathematics at least should be studied by 'oys undergoing industrial training, especially those who anticipate employmentwould^not be as hig^a^tha^attalned 0 ^^ 116 &gt; 1 7i tan ? arci aimed at ordinary education, there is no ^^^L ? ^inal Sta^e' of caralesa inatructi^n aa loll FUTURE DBVELOPMJilNT OP ®iB TECHMTCAL vSGHOOL.

CONDITIONS IN There is an important reason for separating THE OIL COMPANY the requirements of the oil industry from those of the Government Services and the market trades» The Oil Company em- Ploys a large staff of technical experts from America and Europe who are able to supervise closely the local employees and give a good deal of attention to the matter of U»ainii^; them in various kinds of specialioed work* In the case of the skilled trades the Company is able to provide its own form of higher apprentice train ing. For most branches of their work the Company need boys with some general education, a knowledge of English.^ and only sufficient work top experience to form a foundation for the specialised training they will receive in the Company^s works v The pre-employment train- lug of suqIi boys should make them resourceful and adaptable rather than highly skilled in one particular branch of a trade. The case of bovs taking up skilled occupa- MARKET INDUSTRIES tions outside the Oil Company is rather differ- AND PUBLIC SERVICES* er it. The public services and the market are not 80 generously staffed with experts and skilled workers able to attend to^ L ^ thelr work6 - Th is means that the Teshnlcal School must do more for these boys, either before they ffTfoH wn^Vmo^ 0 |l during the early part of their employment as skilled workmen. It must at afty rate prepare them as far as possible to work independently. Of course, no technical school can turn out experienced craftsmen and mechanics. Only years of practice under industrial conditions can make a man master of hi trade. The best school can only teach principles and methods, and provide its soudents with a certain amount of valuable prac tice? io cannot give more than a very limited range of real trade experience, xhis is especially the ease where, as in Bahrain, the urgent cieiiiand^for orained youths makes it necessary to cut down bhe period Ox their schooling to a minimum* There is, however an efiective^ method or dealing with this deficiency in teclinical school training, as the suggestions set down in the following paragraph vail show. INDUSTRIAL SXPEEIENCE FOR STUDENTS, The requirements of both the Oil Company and outside industry could be met by a basic two year course in the Technical Schcolo In the case of boys entering the service of the Oil Company as trade apprentices or probationary workmen, the School would take no further part in their training# For those entering the government Service or taking up employment in private concerns, the School would provide at least another year of supervision» This does not meau that the boys concerned would necessarily spend another year in the school itself. In most cases they would be employed on building works or in workshops outside, side by side with other skilled men? but their progress would be followed by the Technical School staff and provision would be made for them to attend the school at certain times for special instruction. Such an arrangement is actually a modification of the present system of sending out Technical School pupils to work in the Government Departments during the period of their two-year course. As school grows there should be little difficulty in extending this system of co-operation to private industries. The advantages of delaying the outside works experience until the third year of apprenticeship are, first, that the two-year school course would not be interrupted by the irregular withdrawal of pupils from the classes, and second, that outside industry would not be burdened with the care of quite immature workers* By delaying their entry into outside works boys would be better able to give useful service in return for the wages paid to them as probationary skilled work men. THE PHOPOSSD SCHEME OP TRAINING In a technical school giving a two-year course for TRADE ooys between the ages of 13 and 16 it would be quite un- GROUPS, desirable, if not impossible, to give training in the specialised work of each of the twenty or more trades listed in the previous section of this Report. These trades fall naturally into five groups according to the materials, tools and processes which they 'employ, and the scientific principles underlying their Practice.

The total time devoted to workshop instruction HOURS OF I would depend to some extent on the customary hours WORKSHOP and seasons of school work in Bahrain, It Is, however, INSTRUCTION,, quite reasonable to have longer hours in a technical school than is usual in other schools, for workshop practice provides considerable freedom and physical activity, and also in craft work thought is less constrained than is the case during ordinary school lessons. During the greater part of the school year it should be possible to maintain in the Technical School a working week of 36 flours, 8 to 12 of which would be devoted to class lessons. It might e argued that the total of some 2,000 hours of workshop training wlucix each pupil would receive during his two-year course is a poor suostitute for the type of trade apprenticeship carried out by boys in the western industrial countries, where something l ike five or six jjnes this total period is considered necessary in the mechanical pade3 0 In answer to this argument it may be pointed out that in a pcnnical school the pupils are either under instruction or careful Fservation during practically the whole of their workshop time, pereas in a factory the apprentices spend a great portion of their va? 18 on Production work, much of which has very little instructioal ^lue. Thus, a school training is more intensive than the tradition- P- urade apprenticeship and, moreover, is likely to cover a greater S 0 of work in a thorough and systematic manner» There now comes the question of the kind of work WORKSHOP of is cione ^ the pupils during their periods EXERCISES. : workshop instruction. The basis of training in most the trades should be a series of graded exercises, each of which | ould have clearly defined aims.

In the engineering trades particularly, the making of tools affords plenty of scope in the way of practice at the bench and the machines. In woodwork it is easy to devise useful articles which will provide all the practice that is necessary in making joints and carrying out the various forms of construction. In addition to the regular series of training COFIHACT WORK exercises, every department of the school workshops IN THE SCHOOL, should undertake a reasonable amount of contract work, carried out on a commercial basis. Participation in actual trade Jobs makes boys aware of their responsibility as skilled workers and helps to break down the distinction in their minds between 'mere school 1 and ^eal work 1 . It should be an easy matter to keep the wood- (a) WOODWORK working shop supplied with useful contract worki. TRADHIS, The manufacture of furniture for Government offices, schools and residences, and joinery for the Publio Works Department, might form a regular part of the work of the Technical School. Cabinet making and joinery involve processes that could usefully employ beginners and older students alike, and on much of the con tract work in these branches valuable co-operation could be effected* ^ . (b) SNGIHEERIHG Engineering students are not likely to have TRADES♦ the same opportunities for frequent participation in contract work. The repair and overhaul of engines and machinery is work that can only employ a few people at a time, and requires a good deal of experience. The making of new machine parts will not occur often enough to provide a steady stream of work, and usually this work also demands such a degree of skill that beginners can do , little more than watch the process. Nevertheless, the engineering shops need never be idle, and given good equipment and enterprising- instructors this department would attract a great deal of instruetve work if only because the standard of mechanical engineering else- wnere in the market is so low. Although the Oil Company have first ^ate workshops of their own, they may occasionally find it conveni*- , J?* Place work with the Tecimical Schools The manufacture of ^antitles of simple fittings, for example, may at certain times prove uneconomical in their workshops, but might form suitable work lor the Technical School students. The officers of the Company fould no doubt encourage the school in this way if they felt that l t was seriously aiming at high standards of workmanship. , . In view of the many specialised branches of the engineering u-ade open to Technical School pupils, the mechanical trades course should be particularly broad and general* The boys in this group snouid. be taught both bench and machine work* A boy who is ultimate- y to become a turner will be better able to follow his specialised fining if he has a fair knowledge of fitters work and conversely, wiose who are to become fitters should be well acquainted with ^ohine practice.- 14 - I nf The practical work of the Building Trades (c) BUILDING Group Will have to take place to a great extent TRADE PRACTICE away from the school premises and of necessity will have to consist of the erection of actual buildings. Stone and concrete as working materials have an embarrassing bulk and perman ence which preclude _ their use as materials for mere exercises or architectural experiments. Therefore instruction in building will invariably be associated v ;ith useful works^ from simple boundary walls to vaulted roofs or reinforced concrete galleries. This will require close co-operation between the School and the Public V /orics Qepartrnent which, in the early days of the project at leasts should provide most of the work. Building trade students should not only be taught the properties and uses of the different kinds of stone, and the methods of stone and concrete construction^ they should also be given a sound knowledge of drawing, measurement and setting out, cind the principles of carpentry as applied to the forming of stone and concrete structures. The aesthetic side of building work should be given some attention, for in Bahrain much work is carried out by stonemasons without the guidance of an architect^ so that matters of . form and proportion in local buildings depend on the taste of the skilled workmen who erect thenu For the Electrical Trade Group also much of (d) SLSGTHICAL the trade practice will have to be carried out on TRADES, contract works outside the school, and entirely so in the case of electrical installation work in buildings. It should be remarked in connection with the electrical trades course that the students will need some knowledge of the scientific theory -wiucK forms the basis of their trade. In fact, success as an electrician clepends rather more on theoretical knowledge than on manipulative skill. Due regard must be given to this point when choosing the type of boy to follow the electrical course. There is a danger that when a school opens the doors of it^s^ workshops to contract v /ork it will have to accept many tasks which are valueless from the point of view of instruction, or which demand a great deal of attention from the instructors and provide very little work for the pupils, T^ safeguard the training scheme against disturbance from this cause a small number of ex-students of the school should TSMPORAHY EMPLOYMENT be employed as paid workmen, assisting in OF EX^STJDENTS IN THE the normal activities of the shops, but SCHOOL WORKSHOPS* ready to execute work outside the range of ordinary training 'oractice. It is not suggested that these men con stitute part of the permanent staff of the school. On the contrary, they should be held in temporary employment only between the time of completing their two~year training course and their uransxer inuo suitable posts in industry. In this connection it should be borne in mind that however great the demand for skilled labour in industry, it is never an easy matter to place some 40 or 50 boys in suitable employment all at once on the completion of their school course. Vacancies occur in industrial concerns only at irregular intervals5 find to prevent trained boys drifting into unprofitable occupations the school would do well to retain them in paid service until proper outlets were open. The maintenance of a reservoir of skilled labour would not only benefit the individual students. It would enable the s chool to conduct its workshops more nearly on industrial lines by accepting a large amount of contract v/ork ot a high standard.- 16 - ns' snmarl. 0?! , .l§§..sssig- mq outiiinb syllabuses of instrugtiom iR t Ye ox* PRSLMIHi^Y CO U RSE (13 wefeks) Ail new students to be divided into two temporary classes for Sngllsiif Ma thematic s &amp;nd Brawjjig^ and into xour teniporary workshop groups^ all engaged on parallel courses as follows ; U Glass Work i« English (4 periods per week) -*• V/ords and sentences, oonvereation, reading and writing*. ii„ Mathematics (3 periods per week) »«•&gt; The use of European numerals^ Exercised in the four primary rules- of arithmetic with examples based on workshop practice• iii Drawing (2 double periods per week) The use of drawing instruments.

Trade Practice It is unnecessary to give in this Report the five syllabuses of trade practice&lt;&gt; Some of the more import*- ant aspects of trade instruction have been discussed in the foregoing pages. To each course there are 'ftree distinct branches of training, namely : A Graded workshop exercises. Trade technology, Employment on production work. Generally the exercises would receive more attention in the early part of the courses and contract work the later part/The instructional value of production work varies, and cannot be foreseen. Therefore the exercises should be arranged so as to cover as many as possible of the processes and manual operations essential to the practice of the respective trades. They should be numer ous, carefully graded, and not too long and laborious. The building trade, as already indicated, is exceptional in its limited scope for exercise work. Trade technology should consist of short lessons on tools, materials/processes, etc. ^ They could be given in the classrooms or at convenient times in the workshops• Each student should keep a trade note book containing the subject matter of the lessons together with note's and sketches of his own« SPECIAL II-T3TRUCT I0I Provision may have to be made for special day or evening classes for students who have completed their two-year course and- 17 - Ill and are employed in industry or in the soliool workshops* I'he deniand xor such classes is more likely to oome from the ^tu^ dents themselves than f^roni their employers* Voluntary classes are always worthy of great care and^ attention on th^ part of technical school authorities. It may be found desirable in some ^ tradesp or in the case of certain groups of students5 to institute compulsory part-time clashes for hoys who have com* pie ted the normal course. In addition to organising classes for aotual instruction, should this be desirable, every effort should be made by the Principal and staff of the school to maintain contact with ex-students • There should be an offid- ial system of visiting, boys at their work during their first year of outside employment and of obtaining reports on their progress« Employers and overseers v/ould no doubt welcome such a system and could be expected to make constructive suggestions as to the school training• Tn cmiQAL SCHOOL STUDSNTS i Every effort should be made to raise the stan- EDUCATIONAL dard of the Technical School by admitting only in- STANDARD ON telligent boys who have reached a satisfactory ENTRY a standard of general education^ and at the age of 13 or 14 years e These conditions may seem very, hard, and at first it will be difficult to find boys with such qualifications who ara at all willing to take up mechanical trades for their living. It will probably be found in Bahrain^ as in most other parts of the Blast;) that boys who have had any success at all in education look upon manual work as something unworthy of their attention. Neverthelessj by producing examples of successful careers in technical work and by active propaganda in the schools this idea must be gradually destroyed 9 for the Technical School will never fulfil its function properly so long as it has to recruit boys of low educational standard,, It is siill quite commonly supposed that un- AG&amp; OF PUPILS intelligent boys are likely to prove skilful with AMD STANDARD OF their hands, and that really clever boys are was- INTEILIGSNCS. ted if they are put to manual work of any kindo Such views are quite contrary to the experience ot practical peoplej especially those who are engaged in teclinical educa-xlon# To such people it is well known that skilled work^is done best by intelligent and resourceful persons who are quick to learn 9 fruit** tul in ideas, and capable of building up experience. It is a mis- take^ even out of charity, to attempt the training of du-1 and backward boys in the major skilled trades, and almost as unprofit^ ^ble to accept any but quite young boys in any form of trade apprenticeship. Older youths are difficult to teach, and do not usually enter with enthusiasm upon routine work or the less pleasant tasks which constitute so large a part of the daily activities of ^ost skilled workers* Technical education is the most expensive of all forms of education, a fact which alone should determine its strict preservation for pupils of a high standard of mental fitness* Many of the present diffioultles in the TECHNICAL SCHOOL raoruitment of suitable boys for the Bahrain IN RSLAiION TO Technic^ School will be overcome when the new THE SCHEME OF scheme of general education becomes fully oper- EDUCATION . atlve. Under this scheme a considerable of boys at about tlie a^e of 13 or 14 will oe released each year the 1 second stage^ of general education with no prospect of continuing- 18 - ns oontinuingtheir school studies in the very limited 'third stage* schcol. Most of those who leave at about 14 years of age will'be boys of 4° all-round ability, having passed successfully year by year ■through a general school course. At that stage they will be able to read and write Arabic and will have some knowledge of Sngliah. They should have also a foundation of arithmetic and general xrnowleclge« As time goes on tlie^e will be a. leirger number of boys available at ^ 'this sta ^e^ so that it will be possible to select ior the rechnical School candidates with real aptitude fov manual training. Under the existing conditions of life and work MAINTSNANCS in Bahrain it would not be possible for the State OF STODfflTS. to discontinue its contribution towards the support of students undergoing technical training. If re~ niuneration or its equivalent were withdrawn, a l^rge number of otherwise eligible students would be una.ble to enter the Technical Sciiool, and would drift into unskilled labour or raenial work in the shops and offices of the market. The payment of students in money, representing apprentices' wages^ is simple and convenient from the point of view of the Administration^ but it has few other advantages. The only satisfactory method of dealing with the economic problem of industrial training for boys in Bahrain is to have a boarding school with compulsory residence 6 The first great advantage of a boarding ADVANTAGES OP THE school is that excellent discipline and BOARDING 3YSTKM. punctuality can be maintained. Secondly $ without the boarding system technical education would be practical ly confined to boys in Manama and its near neighbourhood«~ Thirdly, the physical welfare and recreation of the boys would receive proper attentiono It should be noted also that the cost of maintaining a boarding house in Bahrain would hot be high*. I venture to place these considerations SUCGSSS OF THS before your Highness because I can speak from BOARDING SYSTEM experience of the great success of the board- IN ^RAQ, ing system in the 'Iraq Government Technical School in Baghdad, where the problem of industrial training is in many respects similar to that in Bahrain. The success and reputation of the Baghdad Technical School is due mainly to the regularity of the students* life and 'training in an environment free from the evils of either poverty or luxury and from the mischievous influences which ordinarily beset the lives of middle and lower class i^rab boys* Discipline is of the highest importance in DISCIPLINiiJe technical, education^ The officials of the Bahrain yil Company gave me many instances of their disciplinary problems in connection with local employees^ Many of their men are un~ Punetual in their attendance and devoid of any sense of responsi bility in the discharge of their duties• They are unaccustomed to the acceptance or exercise of authority, and in many cases ^ould give up their posts rather than submit to the regularity of industrial conditions* These troubles would rarely arise among ^n and youths who had received 'training under rigorous conditions in a boarding school, where punctuality becomes second nature, w here misconduct is readily checked, and where authority and re sponsibility are distributed down, a scale from the head of the establishment to the latest newcomer Only by means of the boarding system STUDENTS OUTSIDE Cou -ld technical education be extended to boys MANAMA. ll m all parts of Bahrain,. It may be argued ^at Manama alone could provide more than sufficient boys for the ^clinical School, and that after all the vocational problem is more19 - n'l mors acute in the town than in the country districts^ There are^ however5 two important points to consider. The first is that the nrot&gt;o3ed improvements in education in the villages should be accompanied by incentives to the village boys, one of which would be admission to technical training. The second point is that v illage boys are likely to prove on the whole more apt for indus trial training than those from the tovtfu The Oil Company have spoken in favour of country men and boys as being more adaptable to certain kinds of labour, though their experience in this matter relates mainly to employees in unskilled and semi-skilled occupa tions/ Certainly, a good technical school would not be giving full and fair service to 'the State unless its doors were open to boys from all parts, regardless of all else but their eduoational qualifications and their suitability for the courses of training* I noted with interest during my visit to Bahrain that two students were to be sent from Kuwait for 'training in the Technical School. ,/itii a larger and more efficient school, Bahrain may be asked to extend this kind of service, but it will only be possible to acknowledge the compliment worthily if the technical training is accompanied by proper boarding facilities. Given the necessary building accommodation COST OF BOARDING, and equipment, the cost of maintaining all the Technical School students in a boarding house would not be high. In Baghdad the cost of food, clothing, laundry, depreciation of equipment, boarding house servants and various small items of expenditure, amounts to about £18 per student, per annum. The malority of the students come from poor families and fma one standard of living in the school relatively high. A boarding house for ICQ students in Bahrain would require one resident master ana an assistant. The latter might be an ex-student working as a junior instructor in the school workshops. The boarding no use would need a dispensary and the regular attendance of'dhe&amp;lt _ _ official. A cook and two or three servants would ^1'- domestic staff5 the students themselves taking part m the domestic work. Although Arab boys have strong-family e adapt themselves vary well to corporate life in a boarding hous , and even look upon compulsory residence as a privilege* When selecting, entrants to the Technical School special interest might be talcen_in boys ARAB STUDEMTb. coming from families with a craft tradition,, . . q , Arab workmen of the artisan class are h^ dw orking, patiant and frugal, and these qualities may reasonably be expected in their children. It is, of course, most usual £or an Arab craftsman hia- self to train one or more of his sons from early childhood in practice of his trade, this being an essential feature in the economy of working-class family life. But it may often happen that a boy from sSch a family displays a and advancement, in which case elemen ^y. sCh00 H^^° iS' technical training would produce excellent ^ ^ ultimately for the community. Officials in ^e Bahrain Oil Company reported very favourably on the aptitude of loc . ^ certain classes of training.

Cimical education should not foster ente^rise, confidence and originality in students of eastern countries with the same successful results as in the west. It w . lII be clear from a study of the scheme PROGRAMME OP proposed jcor the Technical School SMROMENT AND that 'ohe enro^jneny of students at irregular LEAVING, intervals aurizi^c the year would caus© serious disturbances in the courses of study and training. Classes should be forrnea ai, the Deginning of the school year ? and only in excep tional circuits unices ^should newcomers be admitted after th.e first two or three wee^is ox the session^ The only advantage attaching to irregular enro-Lrnent is that students finish their course at various times ot the year* and the school authority is not faced with the problem of placing^ a large number of boys in industrial pesos all ag one time 0 It is obvious that vacancies isi industrial works occur o.al\ a t scattered intervals during the year and cannot always be kept open until particular candidates have completed their set period of schooling&lt;&gt; Under tha regular course system the placing of boys in suit able employment need lot5 however, give serious difficulty 0 If the schoo.- year ends on June 30th and examinations or tests have to be carried out ? these could be given early in May.

With a school of nominally 100 students carrying out a two- year course5 60 boys would be enrolled at the beginning of each school yeare Under a scheme providing, as suggested, for the temporary employment of ex-students, and for part-time continua tion classes of boys already in industry5 the maximum accommoda tion of the school'would have to be for 130 to 140 boyso the maxi- oiufli attendance would obtain between October and December, that ±3 when the temporary ex, )loyment period coincided with the season of continuation classes« Numbers would fall to a minimum of perhaps 80 by the end of June , when, say 5 20 of the second year students would already have been transferred to permanent employmento ■; IS SCHOOL' PRINCIPAL The success of the Technical School will depend almost entire on the ability and personality of the Principal.

In Bahrain the Technical School cannot be conceived on exactly the same lines as nv existing modelo It must develop as something quite individual, ssociated with a set of conditions which are nowhere else to toe fnimd in the same combination* Although the project is not at L* s eHt a very large one 3 the pioneer work of building up such a Lhool cAuld only be done successfully by a tnan with exceptional vision and enterprise in addition to good professional experience. In my opinion the following qualifications are essential to the principal of the School# 1.

Thus^ in some of the shops there wi3-l be as many as 24 students working together for this length of time. In these circumstances the senior instructors should have competent assistance, a condition which has been borne in mind in compiling the table of staff shown below.

Syria, or Palestine, it is practically certain that the selection of candidates would be based on the number of 'their educational certificates, regardless of personal qualities. There would also be no safeguard against the recruitment of mere adventurers in search of comfortable posts abroad. If these coun tries are to^be a source of supply of technical teachers I would strongly advise your Highness to seek the help of resident British officials and education authorities in selecting the candidates. At the time of writing this Report I am not able to add detailed suggestions as to how this could best be done, and I would not make further enquiries into the matter on your Highness 1 s behalf until I know what general principle will be adopted in making the staff appointments« EXTENSION OF THE SCHOOL BUILDINGS The first step in the re-organisation of URGENT NEED technical education in Bahrain should be art K)R EXTENSION, immediate and considerable extension of the school building accommodation* By preparing first a full range modern buildings your Highness 5 a Government will ensure the effect iveness of the work of the new Principal and staff Immediately on their arrlval« It would be a mistake to wait for new students to arrive before taking steps to extend the buildings, for this would only lead to confusiono Moreover, students of the desired type would probably not respond to the appeal of the new scheme unless they realised that the Government had seriously taken in hand the provision of proper accommodation and equipment for the training courses. The method of adding to existing buildings piecemeal as accommodation becomes overcrowded is much to be deprecated and is unlikely to inspire public confidence in the project. Of course, in all building schemes of this sort allowance must be made for further extension from time to time, but there is a minimum size school inwhich a really effective start can. be made. I take this minimum to be a school for 100 pupils, as already suggested 1T i previous sections of this Report. This school should comprise workshops, classrooms, offices, and a boarding house, T &lt;7ith such a scheme in mind it would be desirable PLANS. many points of view to commence an entirely new range of buildings. As, however, it is desired to incorporate the listing school building in the scheme, I have acted accordingly in preparing the accompanying plans.- 25 - 1^7 I suggest that the existing building be re- SCHOOL produced sj^inmetrically on the south-west side of BIHLDlNX-s a new central archway, both blocks of building to lie in the ss^e straight line parallel to the road. The new arch- way is 3.ntenu.eu. to xorm the main entrance to the school preini36Sa The new block is to coiuprise three classrooms, a drawing office/ and a recreation rooni e The existing building, being rather unsuit able for its present purpose as workshops, should be converted into offices, staxf room, library, and one other classroom, as these buildings Q.re narrow, ax. eternal corridor would make the rooms too small* For access to each room, and generally for the protection ox the rooms from the morning sun, I suggest the build ing of a substantial verandah along the whole length of the two blocks of building, opening to the school grounds. The workshops shown in the proposed plan WORKSHOPS» lie parallel to an existing low wall forming the eastern boundary of the site. If this plan is adopted the wall could be increased in height and a road made between it and the workshops building, a sketch is given showing a simple form of construction for the workshops building. The departments could be separated by cross walls or partitions 12 to 15 feet high with large sliding doors for communication. The latter should be arranged so that there is a central gangway not less than 6 feet wide running through the whole length of the works. Each depart ment of the workshops should communicate separately with the' out side, also by means of large sliding doors» Space should be pro-r vided near the building workshop for a spacious builders 1 yard. Access from the public road for traffic to and from the works should be by a special gate at the north corner of the site, and not by the main archway. BOARDING The boarding house is shown on the plan HOUSK. occupying the angles at the south and west sides of the site, covering part of the area which is marked on the Is2600 State Map as a football ground- I suggest for the boarding house a building with ground floor only, having a central corridor throughout its length and a verandah open to the school grounds. The plan shows 10 dormitories, each 48*0' x 17*0', a mess, kitchen, various small rooms, and domestic offices, Each dormitory would accommodate the beds and cupboards of 12 students in two rows of six. No special bath house or recreation rooms are shown on the plan as there is room for these temporarily in the boarding house,which has more than sufficient accommodation for the requirements of the next two years, A vacant portion of the site between the school extension and the boarding house could later be used for building a common room, baths and rooms for the boarding masters. EQUIPMENT OF THE TECHNICAL SCHOOL The purchase of school and workshop equipment is just as important a step in the scheme of re-organisation as the extension the buildings, and almost as urgent. Under the two-year- system I* 'training, 60 new students would enrol at the beginning of the Urst year of re-organisation. Sufficient equipment should there fore be installed in the first instance to enable these boys to go through their first year of training. The remainder of the equipment% h ■ equipment should be ready in the early part of the following yeae when the full complement of 100 students will have 'been reached. At the present time machinery, tools and other workshop equipment are increasing in' price and are WORKSHOPS subject to considerable delay in delivery. I would EQUIPMENT, therefore advise the fitting out of the new work shops at the earliest possible moment, even if some of the equip ment will not be needed irnnediately. a stock of modern tools and machines would have a considerable value to the State apart from its use in technical training, for there are no other Government workshops in the Island where engineering and constructional work could be carried out on the scale that the public services may demand in the near future o The figures against the following items of works equipment needed during the next two years are based on the most recent prices of machinery and tools in Great Britain and they include estimates of the cost of delivery in Bahraino They are at best, however, only an approximation, and the individual figures have little meaning when studied without reference to the detailed specifications of the items in question^ They are given as a guide to the total expenditure likely to be required. All the machines in the following lists are reckoned to be fitted with self-contained electric motor drive.

For the drawing office specially made furniture is required and, and -.drawing instruments, models and other apparatus must be imported,, Some office and general furniture will be needed at the beginning of the re-organisation, but this could be augmented and improved upon as the work proceeds The furnishing and equipment of the boarding house will be an expensive item, the inclusive cost being reckoned at about £5 10s. per place for a boarding house of 100 students, with an additional £4 per place above this number.

Certain preparations could be put in hand at once, but the work of completing the necessary buildings, purchasing the equipment, and collecting together 'the additional teachers required, will be the work of many months» Moreover, much of this work should not be undertaken without the help and advice of the new Principal, whose own appointment will take some time to negotiate., I would strongly advise your Highness to seek a well qualified and capable man at once for this post in order that his services may be available during the difficult period of transition through which the Technical School will shortly have to pass- Having made this important appointment your Highness's Government could embark on the scheme of re-organisation with confidence and free from the responsibility of dealing with matters which properly come within the province of a specialists In concluding my Report I would like to acknowledge the kindness shown to me by your Highness* s Adviser and other members of the Government Staff during my visit to Bahrain, and the ready help which I received, both from them and from the Manager and officers of the Oil Company, while carrying out my investigations. I have the honour to be Your Highness's humble and obedient servant, Geoffrey S. Hutellings. Baghdad, ^st, March 1940»No.C/418 - 4/16. Political Agency, Bahrain, the 15th Kay 1940. BUSH1RE RESIDENCY. No Date From cor^ FlDiSlilL liconos H.Weightman, Esquire, I.C.S., Political Agent, Bahrain To The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire Sub.iect Bahrain Education Sir, I have the honour to forward herewith a report dated the 9th May 1940 submitted by Mr. Vallance, the Director of Education in Bahrain, on the progress made so far towards the reform of the educational system of this State. 2. /hen handing this report to me the Adviser to the Bahrain Government remarked that he feared I might think that the reforms instituted so far were somewhat meagre. In actual fact I am far from holding this opinion. When Kr. Vallance arrived to take up his duties in Bahrain I was particularly insistent that he should take time to assimilate the atmosphere of Bahrain, to obtain a clearer view of the needs and possibilities of the place, and to begin by attempting to lead public opinion gently towards a more reasonable perspective of the uses of education and the means by which its maximum benefits could be assured. Bearing these considerations in mind view is that a most excellent beginning has been made. 3. The early part of Mr. Yallance 1 s report deals with what ciay be desci?ibed as the overhaul of the machinery of the department- 2 - department» v /ith the possible exception of the regulations about bhe use of Arab dress, to which I attach no vast signifi cance, the reforms instituted were all urgently required and were a necessary preliminary to any advance, Cn page 3 Me.- Vallance refers to the propaganda work that has been done in the press, aad. I might mention here my general impression, based on an all-round improvement in the public attitude towards the department, that the public in Bahrain is well satisfied with uhe efforts that are being made* Cn page 4 and in the post script Mr. Vallance mentions the question of health measures taken or to be taken in the schools. While I fear that Dr. Snow, who has only just arrived in Bahrain, may find some difficulty in carrying out his self-imposed programme of visits to the schools, nevertheless I look forward to a vast improve ment in the care of the health of the school children since Dr. Snow has already impressed everyone in Bahrain by his energy and obvious determination. The arrangement made with the American Mission Hospital for the training of boys from the Government Schools in hospital work is admirable; while the results of the experiment at Hedd, Budeyah and Rafa'a are of profound interest and provide valuable data for the extension of activities elsewhere. So far as the two other existing village schools, Sitra and Suq al Khamis, are concerned (cf. page 9 of the report) my own view is that no further time should be wasted in searching for trained Shia 1 teachers and that Sunnis should be appointed immediately. Shia 1 susceptibi lities in these groups of villages will be sufficiently met by the retention of Shia* religious teachers in their schools. I have expressed these views both to the Mviser and to the Director of Education and they are in agreement with me. 4. I come now to the inter-related problems of improving the two large schools in Manama and Muharraq, the creation of a single Final Stage School and the opening of a teachers 1 Training /-Its' - 3 - Training School. Education in Bahrain is now divided into three stages, the Infant Stage, the Intermediate Stage and the Final Stage, each with three classes. It was originally intended to have Final Stage classes in the Manama, Muharraq and Hedd schools, but it is already evident that, for the time being, there will be insufficient pupils to warrant the enter tainment of staff for Final Stage classes in three different centres. Indeed it seems likely that in the next year or two there will be no more than 40 to 60 boys in the whole of the Government Schools in Bahrain fit for Final Stage tuition. This is mainly due to the inadequacies of the teaching staff employed so far in the various schools, and it has long been recognised that little improvement can be made until a proper Training School for teachers is opened here in Bahrain. Un fortunately it has been found that there is no one among the present senior teaching staff capable of training junior school-masters, and indeed there is no one really capable of teaching in a Final Stage school. Thus the immediate essential is to introduce from outside three or four thoroughly well qualified teachers who can not only take the Final Stage school in Manama but can in addition run the teachers Training School in the evenings. Mr. Vallance informs me that he hopes to get in touch with three or possibly four men whom he knows personally, who have the requisite qualifications and who are sound politically- They will be expensive, for they will require salaries of Es 300/- per mensem or possibly more, but I am in full agreement with him that until teachers of this type have been recruited no real efficiency can be introduced into the Final Stage tuition. This position is accepted by the Bahrain Government who are prepared to find the funds required and who, as the result of the concentration of Final Stage tuition in Manama, are at least relieved for the time being of providing for this stage at three different centres. There /-lu Cjo - 4 - There will, it is true, be some small incidental expense; a few of the poorer boys of Hedd and even of Muharraq reaching the Final Stage must be enabled to travel free to and from Manama, but the total expenditure will only amount to a few rupees a month. 5. It will be seen that there must be some further delay- before real improvement can be expected in the Manama and Muharraq Intermediate Schools, but I think this need cause no misgiving i.or the plan now adopted has been worked out on intelligent lines and offers promise for the future• Before leaving this section of my report I should note that the Bahrain Government have accepted the principle that fees should be charged for education in Final Stage. The exact amount of fee to be charged and the exact arrangements to b e made to enable the children of poor parents to obtain a com plete course of education remain to b e settled. It may also be noted that tuition in the Final Stage will b e mainly in English. This I think is desirable though it certainly involves some preliminary teaching of English in the Intermediate Stage. Provided however that this is restricted to the teaching of Roman characters in the second class of the Intermediate Stage With elementary reading and writing in the third class, it need not interfere with the accepted principle that Arabic should be the teaching medium for the Intermediate Stage. 6. Finally there remains the question of the Technical School. I have already forwarded a copy of Mr. Hutchings 1 Report and have pointed out that it sets forth a scheme which is far beyond the needs and capacity of Bahrain. The question of reducing that scheme to more manageable proportions has been examined and I have had some discussion with the Adviser and the Director of Education. It is accepted that technical education is probably the chief essential in Bahrain, and there can /-- 5 - it} if § f can oe little doubt, that if it is to b e adequate and effective it will involve heavy charges against the State's Budget, costing probably between Rs 30,000 and 40,000 annually apart from non-recurring expenditure on buildings and equipment. It is intended that Mr. Vallance should discuss this matter again with Mr* Hatchings with a view to framing a scheme which, while capable of producing the results required, will keep expenditure at the lowest possible limit. This particular matter will be the subject of a further report in due course. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant Political Agent, Bahrain. \rill 9: The Education Office, bahrain. 9 May 1940. To ; C. Dalrymple Belgrave, Esq., C.B.E. Adviser to the Bahrain Government Sir, I have the honour to submit, as requested, a short report on progress in Education since I became responsible for the Department at the end of November last year. The page-numbers in brackets are refer ences to my Report on Government Education in Bahrain, dated September 1st, 1939. The first step taken was to rationalise the working hours of both masters and boys, in all the schools (P.39). The teaching hours of assistant masters were reduced from 36 per week to 28, and those of head- fflasters to 18. Boys of the Intermediate and Final Stages now do 28 periods in the classroom each week, and those in the Infants 1 Stage do 24 Sanction was then obtained from the Government to regularise the Pay and conditions of teachers at the three large schools of Man am ah, toharraq, and Hidd (PP.40 &amp; 41). Grades of teachers were defined ; per manent rates of pay for each grade were fixed ; annual increments^up to Ce rtain maxima, were established ; and participation in the Government Evident Fund scheme was made compulsory. The minimum commencing salary an assistant master at one of these three schools is now 50 rupees per l0n th, and the minimum annual increment, per month, is 5.1' 70o The above measures have given the greatest satisfaction, and the jtaffs of three schools have expressed in writing their gratitude to Ihe Government and their determination to spare no effort towards improv- the standard of education in Bahrain. The rule making participation In the Provident Fund scheme compulsory was looked upon as a privilege, rather than as a burden : in the past, only those teachers whose monthly jay amounted to 50 rupees or over were eligible for membership. All stocks of books, stationery, and other equipment were then coll- jcted from the individual schools, and a central store#, maintained at the Iducation Office, has been created. Books and stationery are now supplied free to all boys except those of the Mnal Stage (P.53). The rule about Arab dress for all masters and all boys, at all schools ixcept the Technical School (PP.25 &amp; 42)^ was introduced, and it has been n 1 Tery well received by all concerned. The admission of boys below the age of 6 has been forbidden (PP. 6,29) &lt; In spite of this, as is shewn later, the numbers in the schools have risen Mnsiderably. t The use of the Quran as a first reading-book has been forbidden, and Proper infants 1 reading-books have been supplied to all the schools (P. 47) Copy-books, for the proper teaching of handwriting, have been intro- feed into all the schools (P.48). Ink has been introduced into all the schools, and the use of pencils, •xcept by boys of the Infants 1 Stage, has been forbidden (P.51). The ^cation Department is manufacturing its own ink, from powder, and this Willi Prove a great saving financially. Daily physical drill has been introduced into five of the seven school*!; I Scouting has not been abolished, as it appears to be dying a natu- . | fi l death.to\ &lt;?- 1 The vexed question of beating in the schools was thoroughly examined, and the exercise of corporal punishnient has now been strictly regularised, on the lines laid down in the September Report, p.52. A series of short articles, supplied by the Education Office, was printed in the local Arabic newspaper early this year (P«67)« The articles tere designed (1) To bring home to the public and to the schooliaasters anc schoolboys the exact nature of the deficiencies in thfrfcr system of education, (2) To define the appropriate remedies, and to ask for the . help and support of all concerned, in putting them into operation# (3) To point out to the schoolboys the great opportunities (chiefly in the service of oil companies) awaiting those of them who would submit themselves to a short course of technical training ; to stress the equal nobility of manual work with any other kind of work ; and to ask Government schoolboys not to be too proud to join the Technical School. The articles were well received by the public, and there was an imm- 'liiate response from the boys, in the form of a number of applications for Places in the Technical School. i fire ex-students of the Carpentry Section of the Technical School,who M completed their training, were engaged by the Education Office as Welling carpenters, and are still engaged in going round the schools ^Pairing the desks, doors, windows, etc., which, owing to long neglect, ^ in a state of very great delapidation (P#ll). The whole of Manamah School, which was very dark inside, has been ^ghtened, by the method of whitewashing all the walls and ceilings of the ^Brooms, and the same plan is to be carried out at all the other schools.- 4 - toz- The health measures advocated on P. 15 of the September Report are iradually being introduced into all the schools. The absence of local ^ dispensaries at some of the Tillages in which schools are situated makes proper attention to the health of the schoolboys very difficult. However the idea of responsibility for the health of their charges is sinking into the Kinds of the schoolmasters, who now very frequently send boys by ♦bus Into Man am ah, to report at the Education Office, with a view to their beii lent by us to one of the local hospitals. This is an expensive method, lince we have invariably to defray the costs of travelling between the Tillages and Man am ah ; it is therefore much to be hoped that before long additional dispensaries will be opened in the villages. The weakness of the present system is that the (Indian) doctors visit the villages only jnce a week, which is of course quite inadequate ; in every case where I sent a boy for medical attention to a Man am ah doctor or hospital, they have insisted that he returns for treatment either every other day 5r every third day. This clearly shews that a single weekly visit by a ioctor is inadequate. A lO-days* propaganda in favour of vaccination was carried out in the Tillages, amongst both parents and children, with the gratifying re sult that although it was frequently stated by us that no boy would be Vaccinated if his parents objected, not a single objection was received, in any village, and no boy absented himself on the day when the opera tions were to be performed. Unfortunately, the actual results were very poor, the successful cases in one school being less than 20%, and we are therefore faced with the necessity of re-vaccination. In my opinion, ^ failures are due to the perfunctory way in which the work is done, a nd the complete absence of previous medical instruction of the boys v the operating doctors. The undesirable ascendancy of Syrian masters over Bahraini masters l^.26&amp; 38) has been effectively dealt with, and it is now well under wood by all concerned that the ultimate object of the Education Depart-I ^ - p - qi gn t is the appointment of Bahrain! headmasters in every school, and of sistant staffs which are 100^ Bahraini. Educational facilities have been offered to the Police (P.64), and {he offer was welcomed by them ; but for various reasons connected with yet iheir war-time duties they have not^been able to find the necessary time fit the classes into their daily time-table. An evening school for members of the Ruling Pamily was opened in tril, and eighteen Shaikhs entered themselves for the classes, which include Arabic, Arithmetic, and English. About half of the students are Itudying all three subjects, and most of the others are studying two. most popular subject is English. The classes are taught by the Hrector, the Education Office secretary, and the headmaster of Man am ah chool. Op to the present, the attendance of the Shaikhs has been good, »nd they are working well. Afi arrangement has been entered into with the American Mission Hos- fital in Manamah, under which half-a-dozen boys from the Oovernment school^ lave begun a two-year course of training in hospital work, including nursing, compounding, and X-ray work. The Hospital has undertaken to pay the boys a monthly wage throughout their training, and the Education apartment has made itself responsible for the continuance of their gen ial education, by means of evening classes. It is understood that there *r8 now well-paid openings for boys with some training, in hospitals run Various oil companies in the Gulf, but that it has hitherto been found ^possible to find trained applicants. r A large building, formerly the premises of the Eastern Bank in Bah- has been rented, to be opened as a Pinal Stage school in October, jlhe building provides three very large classrooms on the ground floor, Asides headmaster's and masters' rooms, and a small library. Above, ther e is boarding accomodation for six masters. The sixty double desks204- - 6 - required for this school have been made by the Carpentry Section of the lechnical School, and the masters 1 rooms are now to be furnished in the game way. The school is intended to accomodate, next October, the pick of all the boys at present in the four top classes of Manamah, Muharraq, and Hidd schools, and after it is opened there will be no Pinal Stage accomodation at all at any of the other schools, which will become Inter- nediate and Infants* Stage schools only, until such time as the Infants are removed to separate schools, when they will become Intelrmediate Schools solely* The new Pinal Stage school will be staffed by new masters entire ly, obtained from abroad* | The neglected state of the village schools (P.ll) is being steadily remedied. Great support has been given to Hidd School, which has been generously supplied with books, stationery, and equipment, end with some of the masters formerly working at Manamah or Muharraq. A football field has been laid out, and the games-master who formerly served Manamah and Kuharraq alone now spends one—third of each week at Hidd School# In every lay the school is now being treated as the equal of Manamah and Muharraq, and the numbers have risen from about 140 to over 250, most of whom axe regular attendants until the beginning of the pearling season, when the nuisbers go down very considerably. This exodus from the school for the pearling has already begun, but an interesting feature of it this year is that not a single boy from the two top classes, which now have competent Waters, is leaving# Budayyi* School has been the subject of some interesting and informa tive experiments. At the beginning of the year the school contained no ^oolcs of any kind, and the staff consisted of two mullas, able to read but tot to write. The curriculum consisted solely of readings from the quran ^ lessons in the practice of religion - how to wash before praying, how pray, and so on. We supplied the school with books, stationery, equip- ^nt, footballs, etc., without any effect at all# The numbers remained atzo&lt; about 18, and the curriculum remained the same, since the mullas were ^uite incapable of making use of the new books. After some preliminary propaga 11 ^ 9, in the district served by the school, one of the best teachers from Man am ah was sent to Budayyi* as headmaster, the mullas being retained for religious teaching alone. The following day eleven new boys arrived at the school in a body, and by the end of the month the number of regular attendants had reached a total of 52. It was then suggested, both to the and to the boys, parents^ that in future only one hour each day should be devoted to Quran and to Religion, and that the rest of the time should be given to Reading, friting, and Arithmetic, and we offered, if this were agreed to, to supply a second good teacher. No single objection was raised, the mullas them- selyes saying that they were well aware of their own limitations, and that they would welcome the arrival of efficient teachers. Accordingly, a second good teacher was sent out from Man am ah, and the numbers again increased freia 52 to over 60. They have now reached 74, and it has been necessary to close the school - which consisted of a single long room - and to commence uilding a considerable extension. The erection of two large additional classrooms is being carried out entirely by local labour, supplied by the three villages served by the school, and the headmaster is himself super- Intending the building operations. The school is expected to re-open in ibout a week's time. The experience gained at Budayyi♦ School makes it clear that what is needed in the village schools above everything else is efficient teaching, that the local people are far more alive to general situations thaii one light be inclined to suppose - as witness their indifference towards mere |Uip»ent, and their immediate response to the supply of efficient instruct- ,r8 * It also suggests that they are less bigoted in religious matters than is conffiionly claimed, as shewn by their ready agreement to the reduction of fean teaching to a single hour a day, when for years it had been the sole 'toject of instruction in the village schools. At the same time, I should '«the first to agree that it is useless to try to spring changes on these totyle without careful preliminary propaganda, reasoning, and clear explana-lOb ' 8 ' lot? Hon of what is proposed. The story of Budayyi* is being repeated at Rufa* School, which until about three weeks ago was in the hands of an elderly Mull a and his son, both of whom could write as well as read, but who were otherwise not very far above the average of the other school aiullas as regards education, three weeks ago, the best teacher at Muharraq School was sent to Rufa 1 as headmaster, again with the willing agreement of the mullas, who declared that they would welcome the'arrival of an efficient instructor, even though he would take precedence over themselves, by becoming headmaster# When the new headmaster arrived the numbers were about 30. More than 20 new boys arrived in the first week, and now, at the end of three weeks of the new regime, the numbers have reached 104. It has now become necessary to supply the school with a second good master, and this is almost sure to lead to a further increase in the numbers. In any case, Rufa* School is now too small for the number of boys who have become regular attendants, and we shall have either to build, or to turn away some of the boys. An interesting feature of Rufa 1 School is the presence in it of a number of girls. About a couple of months ago, while I was visiting the school, the Mulla apologised to me for the presence of one girl, his own daughter. I told him that there was no need to apologise, as the education of girls was a very good thing. I said no more than this, but in a few time there were ten girls in the school, and there are now 25. Their range from about 7 to 11. It is incredible that all these girls are attending the boys 1 school without the approval of their parents, which is a strong commentary upon our too easily accepted view that such a thing as toced education simply could not happen amongst the Arabs. As it happens, 1 aa now removing the girls from the school to quarters of their own, but is solely in order to make room for the greatly increased numbers of the boys, and not from any other consideration. It is very much to be ho Ped that it may be possible to open a regular girls 1 school at Rufa' next October, under women teachers.Ck t© - I regret to say that it has not yet been possible to do very much for the two remaining village schools, Sitrah and Suq AL-Khamis. The difficul ty here is that the villages in which these schools are situated are very strongly - in the case of Sitrah, exclusively - Shi*!, and that it has been impossible to find in Bahrain any Shi*! teacher of sufficient education and ability to go to either of the two schools as headmaster. We have supplied gitrah and Suq AL-Khamis generously with books and equipment, and we are supporting the schools by frequent visits, etc., but, as I have pointed out It Is not equipment which is needed, but good teaching. The numbers at Suq jfl-Khamis remain at about 40, and at Sitrah, the worst school in the Island about 25. At the latter school practically nothing is being taught beyond Seligion and Quran. We are continuing our search for competent Shi ! i mast- irs for these schools, and. if by the end of the school year they cannot be * found we shall try the effect of calling a meeting of the head men of the tillage and suggesting the appointment of Sunni headmasters next year, side by side with the retention of the mullas for the classes in Religion and (tiran. Nor has very much been done, so far, for the two large schools of tenajnah and Muharraq. The exaggerated importance accorded to these two ichools in the past, and the ascendancy which they had gained over all the Ither schools, suggested the wisdom of giving attention and support to the lesser schools first, especially as very little can be dome for Man am ah and toharraq until new and efficient masters have been engaged, and this cannot before the beginning of the new school year. This is not to say that the two large schools have been entirely neglected : they are certainly *ore efficient to-day than they were six months ago. With better teachers ftey should become highly efficient schools. I am glad to be able to report that the reforms carried out in the j^ious schools have not, so far, necessitated the dismissal of any teacher. A great deal of propaganda has been carried o^it, in various ways, in- 10 taTour of the Technical School, especially amongst the boys of the other jchools (P.61). The result has been a steady flow of applications, both for the Carpentry and the Engineering sides. We have, moreover, been able to place 8 trained or partially-trained lechnical School boys in posts at the Oil Camp, some of them as learner- lelders at a commencing wage of 30 rupees a month, others as Machine Shop apprentices at 60 rupees a month, and one as an Air Conditioning apprent ice, also at 60 rupees per month. These salaries are higher than those ,eing received by a number of the masters in the Government schools, and Ms practical demonstration of the financial value of a little technical raining has confirmed the claims which we made in the newspaper articles referred to above, and has greatly assisted our propaganda in favour of he Technical School, which now contains 30 students, a record number, so far. Good reports have been received from the Oil Company of the work and conduct of the boys we have sent them from the Technical School. In December last the Government was aslced to reconsider the question it a substantial enlargement of the small existing school, and sanation was iHained for the engagement of an expert, to examine and report on the (lestion of extension - in the light of local conditions - not only of the nhool premises, but also of the curriculum itself ; he was also to draw up rtusl plans for building. Mr. G. B. Hutchings, Principal of the Baghdad Wmical School, agreed to visit Bahrein for this purpose, and he has since P* us a most excellent Report, which is now under serious consideration. Ihe Technical School has been the means of enabling a start to be made ■ the idea of Bahrain becoming the educational centre of the Persian P (P.28). Three boys from Kuwait have recently joined the school as Ments, two of them with bursaries provided by the Kuwait Oil Company, and 'third privately. All three boys axe taking the full two-year course, ,f which they axe paying fees, at the rate of 30 rupees per month. They f 1 US that other b oys f rom Kuwait will be applying for places at our Tech- i 5 nical School. ■ ■- 11 - A large number of leaflets, boolclets, and other publications, supp lied by the Agency and by the British Council, have been distributed in the schools. Those printed in Arabic are eagerly read, but those printed jn English are practically useless. The reasons for this will be given in the special report on the subject, which you have asked me to write. In conclusion I am glad to be able to say that five months* actual ixperience of Bahrain schoolboys has confirmed the impression recorded on page 69 of the September Report, to the effect that Bahrain boys are of an intelligent type, capable of being educated up to a high standard. Their ■ lanners, bearing, and general behaviour are good, they are obedient and anxious to learn, and I have no doubt at all that if only we can secure a MBber of really competent masters to teach them, we shall soon be turning out boys who will compare favourably, as regards their general education, ilth those of any other Arab State. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your obedient and humble servant, « ♦ » * Director of Education. 4 Since writing this Report I have had a conversation with the recently- appointed State Medical Officer, on the subject of school health in Bahrain. ^ Snow expressed his complete agreement with me as to the inadequacy of N # kly visits to schools by medical officers, and told me that he intended ^ visit every village school three times a weelc, and to treat the boys him- ,el ^ This will be a splendid contribution towards solving the educational Ifoblea in Bahrain, which is closely connected with the problem of health.Telegram From To Ho.

I was unfortunately away on the Trucial Coast at the time of Vallance's all too brief visit to Bahrain and so have had no opportunity of discussing his ideas with hinu I .but I have had talks with Belgrave (hence the delay in sendii^ this on to you), and the views expressed in Belgrave's letter oi the 20th July, of which. I also enclose a copy represent some of the conclusions to which we ourselves have come, j-nere are, of course, aspects of this question on which it is more convenient for me to comment than for him. 3. Taking a broad view, &amp; scheme for a British-inspired college providing higher education in Bahrain for the Arab States of the Gulf, and open to 5audi Arabia, the Hadramaut and possibly even as far as the Yemen is enormously attract ive. And no one could seriously contest Vallance's exposition of the dangers involved in a policy of laissez- xaire. I do not propose to labour these points — for they are self-evident — but to concentrate on certain practical aspects of the project. 4 * 5:Lnc '- propo sal is to locate the College at Bahrain, the first question must relate to Bahrain's needs cnci capacity for absorption of finished students; for it is above Honourable all/ Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Trenchard Fowle, KCIE., CHE., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. f sf6./ &gt; - 2 - all things essential that higher education in these parts should be strictly utilitarian, and v/e must avoid like the p lague the c reation of an unemployable intelligentsia. I agree with Belgrave that it would be unsafe to anticipate that Bahrain could provide permanent employment — in viovernment institutions and in commercial firms —for more than a dozen educated young men annually. This as a steady average. Assuming that the College course will last three years this means en enrolment of 36 Bahrain boys at any one time ('taking,of course, three years to work up to this j.igure;. And probably this figure represents fairly closely the number of parents who — at any one time — could afford and would want to pay, say Rs.30/~ permensem for higher e ucaoion j-or their children* Add two or three young men oi Shaikhly families and we get a maximum figure of 40. These would all be day-students. Bahrain parents would demand this, and uhere are many reasons — building coats, water, lighting, proximity to the technical school and so on — why the College should be built within close range of Manama. o. it is more difficult to estimate the number of boys &lt;■111 rti'imui nwaattfn' wmn m ^■no aigtit eone iivcn. other bulf States. From Vallence 1 s post-script it appears that Kuwait has about 25 boys being educated now in Iraq and Syria; and Kuwait might therefore send 20 in future to Bahrain. Muscat and the Trucial Coast might produce 10 between them. Of audi Arabia I feel quite hopeful, and I do not think it would be unreasonably optimist ic to expect that in the third year from its foundation the j^ ahrain College would be appr oaching a total enrolment of 60 j?oreign boys. For their future employment Bahrain wob M of course accept no responsibility, but for their training as decent citizens a very heavy r esponsibility would devolve on Bahrain.- 3 - 3 6* Now it seems evident enough that if the Vallance scheme is to be a success we must most definitely avoid a 'bits and pieces' construction. .ithout considerable foreign enrolment ? a College in Bahrain would be an absurdity, or at least a top- heavy and rather perilous affair. At the same time, if we are to expect Hulers of other States to send boys to the Bahrain College for education, we must be in a position to send out a really attractive 'prospectus' right from the start — with photographs of impressive buildings and details of an impressive teaching staff. I am convinced in my own mind that none of these ulers will send their youths to a half-fledged College being built — both materially and scholastically — above the boys 1 heads. While, therefore, it would be reasonable to enquire at this stage from other States whether they would support a College in Bahrain, it would be essential to take encouraging replies at their face value, to build at once for the expected total enrolment, and not to attempt any half-hearted policy involving adjustment of the pace of construction to the pace of recruitment. 7* As you will see from Belgrave 1 s letter we think that a College building for ICQ students, a hostel, teacher's hous es, playing grounds etcetera might be constructed for about £■10,000 . I do not feel altogether easy about this estimate, but it will serve as a preliminary figure# Recurring costs will include the pay of an Snglish headmaster, ans^ English Hostel Manager (an essential, in my opinion) and four Asiatic teachers, an allotment at 5 % of capital cost for the maintenance of buildings, and a considerable sum for contingencies. (Hostel commisariat charges will of course be covered by boarding fees and need not be taken into account here). At a rough estimate I shouir, put annuel cl.ar^es at about Its.50,000/- to lis.55,000/- wh en the total enrolment of 100 is reached^ and income will -- at a/- 4 - a school fee of Es.270/- per school-year for Bahrainis and Rs»315/- for foreigners — amount to Rs.30j000/- odd. I doubt if higher fees could be charged, for obviously the coni- bined school and hostel charges to foreign boys must be competitive. In the first 2 or 3 years while the College is working up to its full enrolment, receipts from fees will of course be considerably less, while charges for salaries to school-staff and for maintenance of buildings would also be smaller — though not d reportionately so. I should estimate the net deficit in the beginning at .s.27,000/-, possibly declining later to 8 .20,000/-. And this makes no allowance for loss of interest on capital expenditure. In the light of these figures I think I should repeat my firm conviction that unless the College makes an impressive start, on however uneconomical a basis, there can be little hope of achieving its ultimate objective. 8. How, then,jan such a project be financed ? Bahrain is admittedly wealthy in these days but in a comparative sense only, and we must not forget (a) that it has to support an expensive ruling family who take one third of its income (plus bits) and (b) that we want the Bahrain Government to save .cs.16 lakhs — or another third — for many years to come in order to build up an adequate Reserve Fund. In effect, therefore, one must divide the Bahrain income by 3 when considering her resources for Fev. Projects. That third is ample for current administration, for many much-needed improve ments, even for commercial or economic development (on which, as you know, I have large views), but it is not sufficient to finance in to to any scheme from which Bahrain would not derive the sole and entire benefit. And Vallance 1 s scheme, while of immense benelit (under firm control) to Bahrain, has far vider objects — advantages for the British limp ire and advantages for other Arab States. Politically I feel it is impossible to advocate such a scheme unless we can tell the Shaikh and,his family/Family Advisers that we are willing to contribute or to guarantee contributions towards initial and recurring costs equivalent roughly to the value of the benefits which His Majesty's Government and its other clients or friends might derive from the Vallance scheme. (I hope this is not obscure — I am trying to be brief)• 9 # I submit, therefore, the definite proposal that .His Majesty's Government should be invited to contribute £5,000/- to the initial cost of building, and that the British Council be approached to provide at the Council 1 s expense an English ^ _ ■ ' .r.^^AWS.--- Headmaster. I feel it should not be difficult to convince His Majesty^ Government that £5,000/- is a small price to pay for the advantages they might expect to gain from the establishment of such a College in Bahrain, and the project appears to be one pre-eminently deserving the support and aid of the British Council. 10. Vallance has declare ! that the Bahrain Oil Company ought to be invited to subscribe. Personally I am not very greatly in favour of asking them for a cash subscription; they might aid with a jift of some of the steel-work and its welding, and they might perhaps contribute a couple of scholar ships. But their main contribution should be in providing mechanical and instructional aid in the Technical School which will form so important a feature of the College curriculum. 11. For the rest, if His Highness would make a private donation to help the College tide over its expected heavy deficit in the first two years, I think it would be reasonable to expect the Bahrain Government to defray half the capital cost, and to expend Rs.10,000/- to Hs.15,000/- annually on Higher Education. I am convinced His Highness and his Government ,ould willingly do so, for apart from the direct benefits/benefits to be gained, the prestige that would accmie go . .cShPciin has lor them an inifiiense attraction* Yours sincerely, \/f \Bahrain, July 20th 1939. Dear nightman, ^ I am sending you Vallance 1 s letter describing the scheme v.hich he discussed v, ith me here and which he had been thinking about for some Mme, for makin^ Bahrain the educational centre of the gulf.

It is questionable ofLBa hrain wi t her. fev^er bogs are goia Iriaia.

If tte'^'scKe^lvas''a success, and a thinE it would be, it would add to the irroortance and prestige of Bahrain, I should like to see Bahrain both the redical and educational centre of the Persian Gulf. 4. -there is a real desire in Bahrain for more advanced education than anything which the Government now provides, if this was available I believe people would pay for it. They want education, as a1lance says, not for its on sake but because they believe it will enable them to earn more money. It is the townsoeiole wh&amp; are askins for it and also, now a days, some of the young Shaikhs who have ' begun to be ashamed of being less well educated than shop keepers sons. The townspeople need to earn money, the young Shaikhs do not but I am sure that sc. e of the Shaikhs would willingly nav for thpir sons being educated here. 5., If the institution which Vallance describes came into existence there is certainly no better place for it thari Bahrain 3S^£jOlitical value of the scheme depends much on the suonort 'which W ! a3ht obti.in from neighbouring states, especially, in'mv oninion Arabia. Ibn Saud when he was Kefr spMe'of the danger of ' ' sending boys to be educated in Iraq but I think he would have no objection to sending them to Bahrein. It is very difficult however to estimate how many foreign boys would come here, until the collecrp had been running for some time I dont suppose many i/ould come. 6. Apart from financial and practical questions the most important point.to be considered is the number of men wHo can be absorbed into jobs in Bahrain/ There is now such a 'e of educated young men that the Government ifitself has fco\ I employ - 2 - foreigners, Indians and Syrians, in may positions which could be filled by local Arabs if they were sufficiently well educated. In the schools all senior teachers are foreigners and there are non technical posts in P.V/ # D. ? Electric Department and Medical Dept which could be filled by local men though in some of these cases the men would need a special course a fter completing education here, for example surveyonrs and draftsmen. The same condition exists in the Bapco and to a lesser extent in the case of other commerical firms. It is difficult to give a precise estimate of the number of men who would find employment but I think that for several years to come about half a dozen educated yound men will be needed in Government departments alone for clerical work. I think it could be assumed that the Sapco and other firms would absorb another half dozen men every year. 7. The initial cost of building a college and equigping it would^be Heavy. llance &amp; :vocr c. bo- ^ f-chool' out' in the country, 'chis would cost more and I do not think it is s very prac' ic-jbl-j suj :estion. I won Id' suggest' that fSe' coll eg F'should be near ehougfi' €6 Lianamaor Miiharraq, for the boys to work at the Technical School, v/hich in any case is to be enlarged this year. A building to accommodate 100 boys, allowing for future development, with a hostel for 60 boys, and quarters for teaching staff could I think be built and equipped for, gay £10,000, Hs«1 ^30 ^000/-, provided that it was not built on reclaimed Tam^wEich 'increases the cost of building considerably as in the ca e of the Law Courts, Hospital and Customs Eouse. Local boys would be day scholars and foreign students would live in the hostel. 8. It is difficult to estimate the runnifin coat of the college. On the basis of 40 students with one English head aster ana Tour' Asiatic teachers with twenty boarding boys and twenty day boys I calculate roughly that the c ost per ann^,..wQj^,X v &lt;i^be about' Hs. 30, 000A If the students ^t Jhe s\ te of c. /- 1 .1 . xor^Iay r jo ; 3 and jls. i'o■ • or ^ oulTT)e a^oou t'' ts . 14,060 per school ycar.

An efficient Syrian school inspector costs not less ■than .3.4200 per annum. In addition to this the Government would stop sending boys to Beyrout for education which costs now about .slOOO/' for a school year. There are two young shaikhs now at Beyrout, 9. The scheme on the whole appears to me to have great p^s bibiiii&gt;ae's rtT _ oul ! be useful for laKrain and I be^eye' ; :cl-' .acal'^'. ^ae - ^hrain' •lovermem'v/ould satisfy 'tTie~puBlic demand'Tor' n'igHer education and would ensure a supply of educated men uncontaminated by foreign influence and there would no longer be the need to send young en to Beyrout, which is expensive, or to Iraq and India. From the wider political point of view the presence c students from other states is essential, I believe they would come. I see no reason why the states concerned should not be sounded on the subject. I believe the scheme has has great political value, such value that in order to facilitate its political object Bahrain might reasonably expect financial help fro outside to carry it through. If substantial assistance was • forthcoming I should be strongly in favour of carrying it out but Without this assistance I think 4the burden which would be placed on Bahrain is too heavy.

There is, however, one of Vallance•s suggestions which both you and Galloway can consider now* For both Bahrain and Kuwait Yallance made the sound criticism that the boys knew nothing of the history of their own State. f? I With regard to Bahrain in paragraph 14 of his report of 26th June he wrote as follows, (Yallance did not number the paragraphs of his Bahrain Report, but I have done so for him# Paragraph 2 begins w As you know I have seen eto.% and the last paragraph is Ho♦17)# 'At neither place (i.e.Bahrain or Kuwait) had anyone made it his business to provide the schools with a local History, or a History of the Gulf; with the result that while Gulf boys know nothing whatever about their own long history, or about our 150 years* protection of their shores and their' liberties, they know (from Damascus history-books) all about the struggles for freedom of the various / oppressed Wieightman Ssquire, ICS., Political Agent, Bahrain, ; n c/o Postmaster, Ziarat#-2- 11 oppressed and ill-used Arab States• 11 In regard to Kuwait, in paragraph 10 of his report of 28th June he wrote: 'The next thing I ought to mention is the necessity of cultivating in the school-children a proper feeling of patriotism, and by this I isean a patriotic feeling for Kuwait, rather than for the Arab world as a whole* I was sorry to find many of the boys, at all the four schools, using exercise books which bore on their covers the portrait of a foreign ruler and the name of a foreign State. This should be absolutely forbidden and if any portrait is to be placed on the school exercise books it should be that of the Shaikh of Kuwait. I was glad to find that there is a National Song, composed by a Kuwaiti, and learnt and sung in the schoolss but there is no History of Kuwait in use there, and this defect ought to be remedied at once. A commission should be given to some competent person to write, for an agreed fee, a school history-book, dealing only with the history of Kuwait before they begin to learn any other history? for this reason the book should be written in an extremely simple style, suitable for the lowest classes in the schools. We cannot expect to find the full measure of patriotism in our subjects unless we have taken some steps to foster patriotism in them while they are still children at school. 11 3. ^(^.Galloway in paragraph 4 of hi a letter of loth July 1939, Uo.0/273, (not sent to you), aaid that he had asked Vallanoe if he would write the Kuwait History, and Vallance agreed / provided/ 6. -3- provided he were paid £ ICO/- for higher aod lower grade History, to include Arabic translations# The figure appeared to Galloway reasonable, as it does to uae, and I am of opinion that Yallance is the obvious authority to produce such a History both for Kuwait and Bahrain. The payment to Vallance for a History of Bahrain would presumably be the same as for a History of Kuwait, I quite agree with Yallance that such Histories would have an excellent affect. 4* The payment for these Histories in each case would be made by the Bahrain and Kuwait GoTermaents on whom also would fall the cost of printing. If you see no objection please write to Vallance and ask him if he is willing to write a similar History for Bahrain as for Kuwait and for the same payment,i.e. £ 100/-, and if the reply is in the affirmative, ^hich I imagine it will be, please approach the Bahrain Govern- ment. Galloway should ask the Shaikh of Kuwait whether he is prepared to pay the £ 100/- to Vallance for the Kuwait History, and if the reply is in the affirmative, which I think it will be, since it will appeal to the local patriotism of the Shaikh and his Council, Yallance can be informed accordingly. 5. Both the Histories of Bahrain and Kuwait will have to be vetted by us before being issued, as in their later Chapters they will touch on foreign affairs and our connection with these States. This should be explained to Vallance, and he should be asked to be good enough to let us have copies of the Histories in English before he begins the Arabic translation. Ittien these have been approved of by us, after consultation with the India Office and the Government of India, drafts in Arabic can be submitted to the Shaikhs of Bahrain and Kuwait for their approval.-4- 6. In addition to the above two Histories there should certainly in my opinion be a third ones that of our henefioent connection with the Arab States referred to by Vallanoe, coyering not only Kuwait and Bahrain but also the Trucial Coast and Muscat. This History would be taught in both the Kuwait and Bahrain schools, to whoiD copies would be supplied free, Copies could also be sent to the Trucial Coast, which is now taking an interest in education, and to Muscat for use there• It would not need to be a lengthy production* It would be prepared by us, in consultation with the India Office and the Gorernraent of India, and we would have to make arrangements for its translation. I do not think that we can expect the Shaikhs to pay for its translation and print ing, and His Majesty*© Government should bear the cost, which, as a means of efficacious Publicity, would be money well worth spent# In fact I cannot imagine a better form of Publicity or one that would have a more lasting effect, ?• There are thus 3 Historiess (a) Of Kuwait, to be prepared by Yallanoe and paid for by the Kuwait Governosent. (b) Of Bahrain, to be prepared under similar arrangements. ; (c) Of the British connection with the Arab States of the Persian Gulf, to be prepared by us, and paid for by His Majesty's Government. I am sending a copy of this letter to Caroe, Peel and Galloway. #sent fender Printed letter ifo.C/357 of the 15th August, 1939•1 discussed the question of the 'Gulf College rt at Bahrain with Mr, Dundas this morning and showed him Mr• Vallanee•s proposals. 1 pointed out that the Bahrain proposals were not altogether clear, and that the figures were doubtful, e.g. the £ 10,000/- mentioned for building purposes would obviously be exceeded. Mr. Dundas agreed and added that the deficit on annual running costs would be higher too, as he doubted whether a College for so few boys could be run at a cost for boarders less than £ 120/- per capita ^ 2. I proposed that Mr.Yallance should be offered to Bahrain as an Snglish teacher, the subsidy of £ 500/- earmarked for Kuwait being diverted to Bahrain for this purpose so that he could raise their High School in the interval and improve its standard. During the course of the year Bahrain could supply us with more definite proposals and with accurate figures in consultation with Mr. Vallance, and we could then put up concrete sugges- there would be no difficulty in transferring the subsidy for the Snglish teacher from Kuwait to Bahrain, provided we gave notice of the proposal. 1 said that 1 would discuss the question of the transfer of the subsidy from Kuwait to Bahrain with Major Galloway, and added that 1 was under the impression that no reference to the subsidy had yet been made to the Kuwait Governmait. It was thought that Kuwait was perhaps scarcely ready to accept a full-time European teacher at this stage of its evolution, but that Bahrain should be asked in return for the subsidy to allow him to come to Jluwait from time to time to advise them on educational matters. tions to the B-ahroin QovGrnmsnt.

I* Vallance would be full-time Bahrain Government servant &gt;ut it is hoped that in consideration of British Council subsidy Bahrain would allow him to visit Kuwait without expense to Bahrain government and advise Shaikh upon educational matters, inspect their / schools (Signature) {Designation)-2- achools and also give facilities for training of Kuwait teachers in Bahraiijuntil they were a^le to make satisfactory educational arrangements for theraselTes^ The maximum amount of time to be deroted to Kuwait could be laid domu I understand from Bundas that in order to qualify for this particular grant Tallance would hare to be actively engaged in teaching English, This I believe is what Bahrain Government desire and would not be incompatible with his running High School on improved lines and advising Bahrain Government generally upon education. 5. Dundas has seen this Express Letter and though a reference to British Council will be necessary he considers proposals are in line with their policy and will be acceptable to them# 6# Please telegraph whether Bahrain Government wish to engage Vallance on above terms.

I am sorry that the draft contract went to you in such a mess, but I received it only just in time to enclose it in last week's mail. V 3. I suggest the following amendments in the draft contract, which Belgrave accepts on behalf of the Bahrain Government. Paragraph 1 For six months notice read three months notice, insert a comma after 'side 11 in line 5 and the word 'and' before 'renewable'. Paragraph 2 Insert the words 'in English' after 'instruction' in line 4. Paragraph 6/- e Honourable Major C.G. Prior, C.I.S., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf Kuwait-2- 5/- Paragraph 6 Delete 'Furlough' in the heading and insert 'Leave'. In line 1 of this paragraph substitute 'with' for 'to'. Paragraph 7 Re-draft as follows: (a) A first class passage by rail and sea from his present residence to Bahrain will be granted to Mr, Adrian Vallance on his first joining his post, (b) A first class ioe^CHvy passage to the United Kingdom by sea and rail will be granted to the Superintendent of Education on the final termination of his contract* (c) A first class return passage on leave by sea and rail to the United Kingdom will be granted on the completion of each two years of approved service. 4. I think this will be sufficiently clear. The trouble in the first instance was that Belgrave 1 s own contract, for the drafting of which we were apparently responsible, was taken as a model. I have had to use in paragraph 7(a) the words 'his present residence' because I am not sure where Vallance is now though T suspect he is in Basra. If this is so the draft could be amended accordingly.UO -3- 5. As now drafted the agreement provides for a free return passage home every other year during the summer vacation. This is in point of fact cheaper to the Bahrain Government than Belgrave 1 s original draft proposal, while I think it is quite sufficiently generous.

The materials upon which the Report is based are as follows:— (1) A personal inspection of all the Government schools for boys in Bahrain. (2) A personal scrutiny of the exercise-books used by the boys during the school year, and of the examinatioa-papera set for them at the end of the year. (3) Conversations with headmasters, assistant masters, and boys, at the schools concerned. I was frankly informed, on my arrival in Bahrain, that there had been a certain amount of dissatisfaction in the Island with the existing state of affairs in education, and that there were a number of people who were pressing for various kinds of reform. I asked your Highness's British Adviser whether it would be possible for me to meet some of these people and to hear their views, and his reply was that I was completely at liberty to consult anybody I liked, and he offered to provide me with a list of those persons in the Island who, though not themselves connected with education, were the most interested in its improvement. Later, however, I decided that it would be better for me to form my own opinioQs , entirely, rather than to take them at second hand from other people, and I was therefore careful, during the whole of my stay in Bahrain, not to see anyone except those who were actually working in the schools. To this rule I made two exceptions, and interviewed the Employment Officer of the Oil Company and the Manager of the Eastern Bank, in order to ascertain beyond any doubt the views and opinions of employers of labour with actual experience of Bahrain schoolboys as eoaployees.2 When we are coDsidering the question of public instruction it is well to keep clearly in our minds the four main ideas upon which any rational scheme of education must be built up. Those four ideas are : Purpose, Policy, Control, and Method. We must know what is our purpose in provid ing education at all ; we must select some policy which is likely to achieve that purpose ; we must furnish some kind of control ; and a choice must be made among the various methods of instruction. The purpose of education can be decided only by the authority which is providing it ; the policy to be pursued may well form the subject of suggestions by an adviser ; the control of the scheme should be put into the hands of some sort of supervisor ; and to him should be left the duty of deciding upon and instituting the exact methods of instruction which are to be emplo} ed in the schools for which he is responsible. My first step, therefore, was to seek an interview with the Education Department, in order to ask them what was their purpose in providing public instruction in Bahrain. The reply which I received was as follows : 'The purpose of the Government is to provide the State with loyal and useful subjects, and to provide those subjects with something of value to them selves.' The purpose having been thus clearly defined, I was able to begin my inspection of the schools, with a view to forming an opinion about policy, control, and method.During the next five days, I inspected the large town schools of Manamah and Muharraq, the intermediate school at Hedd, and the four village schools of Suq-al-Khamis, Eufa'a, Budaya, and Sitra. I also paid a surprise visit to the Technical School at Manaraah. The Technical School, for which there can be nothing but praise, is dis cussed later in this Report. As to the other seven, I found that there were enor mous differences in usefulness and efliciency between the individual schools. Summing them up very briefly, I may say that the two most disappoint ing were Budaya and Sitra, which are moribund and practically useless. Rufa'a was a very bright spot, chiefly because the boys at that school are healthy, and are therefore able to work properly, and because the headmaster has the real schoolmaster spirit and has been able, in spite of all his difficulties, to establish a proper school atmosphere in his tiny building. Suq-al-Kbamis was well-conducted, and would have been another bright spot, but for the low standard of health throughout the school, which nullifies the best efforts of the headmaster and his assistants. Hedd impressed me very much. Taking into account the many obstacles with which the headmaster has to contend, I am inclined to think that Hedd is the best of the seven schools. Manamah and Muharraq are in a class by themselves, possessing all the well-qualified teachers and a more advanced curriculum than the other schools. But having said this much about the individual schools, let me hasten to add that no blame for the sad state of affairs at Budaya and Sitra can be apportioned to the headmasters of those schools, since they have never received the slightest help, advice, or even encouragement, from the late Inspector, from the headmasters of the town schools, or from anyone else * nor can any praise be given to the superiority of Manamah and Muharraq since that superiority has been achieved at the direct expense of the other five schools of Bahrain. I shall refer to the callous neglect of these five schools later in this Report. My more immediate object is to examine the charge, which I under stand is made by a certain section of the public, that Bahrain education is inefficient. To some extent, I am afraid, that charge is true—employers of Bahrain schoolboys would certainly subscribe to it : but it is too severe for some of the schools are doing a great deal of good work. Perhaps it would be more accurate to say that the Government schools of Bahrain are far from being as efficient as they might be, and as they ought to be. That, I think, is the true position. Who is to blame for this state of affairs? Not the Government en tirely, or even largely, for if public instruction is to be a success, there must be close co-operation between all three partners in the venture, the Govern ment, the executive, and the public, and in my opinion the Government has fu ly played its part. We shall see how far the other two partners have co-operated. Apart from the question of ill-healtb, which is very fully discussed later m this Report, there are, in my opinion, seven main causes contributing towards the inefficiency of the schools o{ Bahrain, and I propose to examine these one by one, suggesting a remedy for each.The first cause of inefficiency is Irregular Attendance. There can be no successful education of children if they are to be present in class one day and absent the next. The children of Bahrain attend school irregularly for three reasons : the first is illness, the second is seasonal employment, and the third is parental neglect. Illness is discussed afc some length later in this Eeport ; absence through temporary or seasonal employment we cannot at present prevent ; and as for absence through parental neglect, there are two separate remedies. If we wish children to attend school regularly, we must (apart from keeping them healthy) do two things : we must educate parents and children in the importance of regularity, and we must supervise attendance. It is not sufficient merely to mark crosses day by day on pieces of paper to signify that certain pupils have not come to school. We must follow up, each day, each case of absence. The child may be ili, or for some other reason pre vented by its parents from attending, or it may be absenting itself without the parents' knowledge. Obviously neither the headmasters nor the assist ant masters of the schools have the necessary time at their disposal for the making of close enquiries about absences, and consequently we are obliged to employ officials, called attendance officers, to do the work. The duty of an attendance officer is to go each day to the houses of all the missing children, to ascertain beyond doubt the causes of their absence, and to communicate them to the headmaster of the school. The further duty of such officers, in Bahrain, would be to act as liaison officers between the sick children and the local dispensaries. I recommend that your Highness should give orders for the immediate appointment of attendance officers, at least in the three schools of Manamah, Muharraq, and Hedd. At the other schools such duties could perhaps be undertaken by the headmasters, but this is not entirely satisfac tory, and a regular attendance officer in each school, if it can be afforded, would be far better. As to the education of both parents and children in the matter of attendance, this is the proper work of the schools themselves. I therefore advise your Highness to issue instructions to the Inspector, making it a definite part of the duty of the schoolmasters to address parents and children, at frequent intervals, on the importance of regular attendance. Children are always open to reason, and parents are sometimes, and I am sure that if the schools will take this matter of attendance under their care, there will soon be an improvement.The second cause of inefficiency is Premature Leaving. Boys are quitting the schools before their education has been completed, and the lure is usually a well-paid post with the Oil Company. For this state of affairs neither the Government nor the schools are to blame : the fault, if any, is with the short-sighted policy of those parents who allow their children to leave but this brings us back again to the question of poverty, which is only too often the cause of short-sightedness in education. The remedy for premature leaving is three-fold. First, we must ask the Oil CJompany, and other employers, to co-operate with ug, and to refuse to take into their service any schoolboy who cannot produce a government certificate to the effect that his education is sufficient. (This arrangement has, in fact, already been made with the Oil Com pany, who agreed that a higher standard of education amongst their recruits would be to the advantage of all, and who showed the utmost willingness to help towards the improvement of edacation in Bahrain, by falling inwith the suggested certificate scheme. The various certificates of education which it is proposed that the Government should issue to schoolboys are discussed later in this Keport.) Next, we must improve education (in various ways which are fully discussed later) to such an extent that in future a Bahrain boy of 15 will have attained the same educational standard as he would have attained, under the old system, at 17 or 18. If we can do this, early leaving will cease to be premature leaving. Finally, we must educate both parents and children in the importance of completion of schooling, whatever may be the inducements towards cutt ing it short. This education of parents and children should be carried out by the schoolmasters themselves. I suggest that your Highness should approve of the scheme for Govern ment certificates of education which is described in detail later in this Report, and should order the Inspector to arrange for talks by the schoolmasters to both parents and children on the importance of completion of education.6 The third cause of inefficiency is Overcrowded Classes. The classes in most of the schools are far too large. It is impossible adequately to teach 40 boys in a single class—especially when those boys are very young. Yet some of the classes regularly contain more than twice that number. At Muharraq School, for example, there are actually 140 infants on the register of the lowest class, aud between 80 and 90 of them are regular attendants. How can the instruction of a class of this size be anything but a farce ? The chief cause of overcrowding in the classes is to be found in the large numbers of Atfal, or infants, attending the schools. These babies, many of them too young to be at school at all, and sent there simply for the convenience of their parents, usually take up the two lowest classes, and the whole of the rest of the pupils have thus to be crammed into the remaining four—I am speaking now of the three larger schools, Manamah, Muharraq, and Hedd. In some of the village schools the conditions are worse : at Sitra, for example, where the school consists of a single room, there are again 140 names on the register 1 Later in this Report, and as a remedy for a different evil, I am recom mending your Highness completely to remove the Atfal from the schools of Manamah, Muharraq, and Hedd, and to house them in entirely separate Infants' Schools. If this is done, the overcrowding of the classes in three of the schools (Manamah. Muharraq, and Hedd) will be solved, for after the removal of the infants, who now occupy the two bottom classes at each school, it will be possible to distribute the rest of the boys over six classes instead of four. As to the other four schools, I am recommending later in this Report that they be enlarged.7 The fourth cause of inefficiency is the Lack of Sufficient Text Books, a matter which is separately discussed at a later stage in this Eeport.8 The fifth cause of inefficiency is Antiquated Methods of Teaching. These are employed in some of the subjects, by some of the teachers, in some of the schools. So inconsistent a state of affairs could exist only where there had been an almost complete absence of supervision of the teaching. Later in this Report I shall give a few examples of the anti quated methods that are being employed in the schools of Bahrain, and I shall describe the modern methods which ought to replace them. The remedy for antiquated methods of teaching is of course a proper supervision by the Mufettish, or Inspector. I recommend that your Highness should order the new Mufettish, as soon as he is appointed, to give his early attention to the introduction of modern methods of teaching into all the schools. Constant watchfulness by the Mufettish is essential in this matter, for it is not to be expected that a teacher who has consistently used certain methods over a number of years will readily give them up in favour of others with which he is less familiar.9 The sixth cause of inefficiency is the lack, by all the students, in all the schools, of a Sound Grounding, or Educational Foundation. It has long been realised in the European countries that the babies' classes of any school are of far greater importance than the top classes, and that only the very best teachers are capable of properly teaching infants. It has long been realised that unless a child has been given a sound founda tion durnig the first few years of his school life, all future efforts of educate him properly will prove unavailing. It is during the first two or three years of his school life that a student is made or marred, for it is then, and only then, that he is likely to learn the educational virtues of neatness, order, method, logical thought, effort, con centration, and the like. These things cannot be taught later on ; and unless a student possesses this foundation, for his later teachers to build upon^ his case is hopeless. For this reason the European educational systems lavish the utmost care upon the education of the Infants, considering them to be of far greater importance than any other students. In the East the prevailing practice is exactly the opposite. Here we always find the best teachers being given to the highestr classes, and the young, inexperienced, poorly-qualified teachers being considered quite good enough for the babies. No greater mistake in education could possibly be made, and the making of this mistake is one of the chief reasons why the educational standard of the Arab countries is so low, when compared with that of the countries of Europe. The present system in Bahrain is to herd together in small rooms, for hours on end, large numbers of infants, under the care of young and inex perienced teachers, and then to be surprised, later on, to find that the educational standard in Bahrain is low. These little boys are given no books from which to study, nor are they provided with any kind of manual occupation, so important in the early education of children. They are ex pected to sit, hour after hour, morning and afternoon, watching each other's efforts with a piece of chalk on a blackboard which only a few of them can see. At other times they spend long hours copying from printed books words or sentences of which they do not even know the meanings. The amount of education imparted by these methods is practically nil—in fact this is not education at all, and such a curriculum can only succeed in implanting in a child's mind a deep hatred of school and study, and all connected with it. Infants at school need special teaching, special equipment, special hours, much handwork, much play, and individual surroundings. These things cannot be obtained in schools which are designed for the education of boys up to the ages of 17 and 18. Quite apart from this, it is undesirable that infants should frequent the same schools as youths of twice or three times their age. And it is utterly undesirable that they should be made to work the same number of hours. If there is to be any real improvement in Bahrain education, that improvement must begin at the bottom, and it cannot come from the top. I want to press upon your Highness the urgent necessity of ordering a com plete reversal of the present policy regarding the education of Atfal in Bahrain. Absolutely separate schools should be built for them, as soon as possible, at Manamah, Muharraq, and Hedd. They should be provided with10 the best teachers that the Education Department can find ; they should become the special care of the Mufettish ; and they should be looked upon by all concerned as being the most important of all the students in the State schools. If these things are done, we shall see in a few years' time an enormous improvement in the middle and upper classes of the schools. If they are left undone, there will be little chance of any really substantial improvement in the standard of education in Bahrain. (As regards the education of the infants at the four village schools, I shall make suggestions later in this Eeport.)11 The seventh cause of inefficiency is The Utter Neglect of the Village Schools. The schools at Hedd, Suq al-Khamis, Rufa'a, Sitra, and Badaya are between them responsible for the education of 582 boys. This, at any rate, is the number of boys whose names appear on the registers compiled at the beginning of the school year. When I arrived at the school of Budaya, which has a registered total of 80, I found only 8 very young boys present; and at Sitra, which has a registered total of 140, I found two infants of about six years of age, and a sick youth of about 16, who was obviously making use of the place merely as a club. At neither of these schools could I find any books, of any kind. In each there was a blackboard, but there was no chalk. The interior of the buildings and the few tables or desks were dilapidated and dirty. Both schools w 7 ere practically dead. The headmasters told me that no one in authority ever came near them, and that they had found it impossible to obtain any sort of equipment or supplies, although they had frequently asked for them. They struck me as being earnest but defeated men, reduced to a state of helplessness and inaction by the callous neglect of those w 7 hose duty it was to support and encourage them. At Eufa'a things were better, but only because the headmaster and his son, in spite of all the difficulties confronting them, had somehow been able to organise some semblance of a school. But there were only 19 boys being taught, out of a registered total of 70, and I was surprised that the headmaster had been able to persuade so many to attend. At Suq al-Khamis there were 27 sickly-looking boys, out of a registered total of 92; and at Hedd there were 39, out of 200, The story of the head masters in these two schools was the same. They said that they never re ceived the slightest help or encouragement from anyone, from the beginning of the school year to its end. They had found it impossible to obtain any of the well-qualified teachers—who were always alloted to Manamah or Muharraq— or the necessary equipment and books for the bare instruction of their pupils. Neither the Inspector nor any of the Syrian teachers ever came near them. Under such circumstances as the=!e, surely the highest praise is due to the headmasters of Hedd, Suq al-Khamis, and Rufa'a for the courage and the sense of duty which alone can have enabled them to carry on. In my opinion, they have done well to have been able to persuade even a small number of boys to come to their schools as regular attendants. It is impossible to condemn too severely an Inspector of Education who could allow such a state of affairs as I have described to exist j nor can his Syrian subordinates be entirely^ absolved from blame. After all, these men come to Bahrain purporting to be of superior education, and to be capable of showing the less-educated Bahrainis how things should be done One frequently hears the Syrians describing themselves as ' the educators of the East.' But even the most elementary knowledge of education should be enough to show an Inspector of Education the shamefulness of cramming the whole of his best teaching talent into a couple of 'show schools', at the. direct expense of all the others under his care. Also the shamefulness of arranging for the youngest of the teachers from his own country a salary which is five times larger than that which is paid to a Bahraini teacher ofmore than twice the age and experience of the other. Yet these are some of the things that have been happening. I found that every single Syrian teacher engaged by the Education Department had been allotted either to Manamah or to Muharraq. These two schools have been liberally supplied with all that they have asked for, in the way of books and equipment: the other five schools have received next to nothing, or literally nothing. A young Syrian at Muharraq School, aged 24, and teaching only physical drill, is being paid five times the monthly salary of a Bahraini teacher in the same school, whose age is 55, and who teaches for 36 hours a week in the classroom. The headmaster of Hedd, who has been teaching for 13 years, who has 200 boys on his register, and who is responsible for the entire conduct of the school, is receiving only 80 rupees per month in return for his services to the State. And the headmaster of Kufa'a is receving only 40. There is no point in dwelling upon these matters, especially as the Inspector in question has now resigned his post. I will therefore simply sum up by saying that the utter neglect of the village schools has been one of the chief causes of educational inefificiency in Bahrain. The remedy, of course, is a new Inspector, with a sense of justice and an appreciation of the true meaning of education. He is bound to have an uphill fight, at first, in his efforts to undo all the harm that has been done to education in the villages. Later in this Report I shall make suggestions for the regenera tion of the village schools; and in that section of it which deals with control, I shall urge your Highness to appoint a new Inspector without delay.13 Having discussed the seven causes of inefficiency, let us consider what necessary school features are completely absent from the present system of education in Bahrain. In my opinion, there are three serious deficiencies, and the first and chief of these relates to the Care of Health. I hope I do not speak too strongly when I say that the health arrauge- ments in the schools of Bahrain, or rather, the lack of them, would be a reproach to any educational system in the world. There is, in fact, no care of school health at all—and this in a State where several kinds of serious disease are particularly prevalent, and where the most elaborate health provisions are being made in other directions. I am putting it mildly when I say that I was shocked at what I saw in the schools—and no doubt the children who were present during my visit were only the healthier ones. There were numbers of quite young boys who had lost, or were losing, one eye, and there were many who would inevitably lose both. The condition of some of these children was such that they were not even able to open their eyes to the light. Not one of those whom I questioned had received any medical attention at all. In all the schools, practically the only boys who were free from dental decay were tbe boys of African origin. There was no school dental service, and no school instruction in dental knowledge : the idea seemed to be quite unknown. In some of the schools about half of the boys present were heavily marked with smallpox, and of course I saw only the survivors. Malaria is very prevalent in some of the school districts, and it plays havoc with the health of children ; yet I could hear of no school organisa tion of any kind for combating it, or of any school instruction about it. Under-nourishment was rife in every school, and any doctor would be able to advise the Government of all the evils which under-nourishment brings in its train. When I expressed my astonishment at this state of affairs, all the headmasters assured me that it had never been made a part of their duty to concern themselves with their pupils' health. Two of them, however, told me that they occasionally gave quinine tablets to boys whom they noticed to be suffering from malaria in the classrooms : but these acts of kindness emanated from their own hearts, and not from any organised plan of attack upon school disease. The headmaster of Hedd School had a small store of medicines, which he had obtained at his own expense, for the use of those of his pupils who showed obvious signs of illness while actually sitting in their desks. That was all. I learned that no school rules had ever been made about the isolation of the sick from the healthy, and that there was no liaison of any kind between the schQols and the dispensaries. In a report on school health in Bahrain, which has just been sent to me by post, I find the sentence : 'Children requiring treatment for any condition are sent to the nearest government clinic.' However true this may be in theory, I am quite satisfied, from what I was told at the schools and from what I have seen for myself, that it does not happen in practice.' Are there for example, any government clinics at all at Budaya, Eufa'a, or bitra—all of which contain schools ? And if not, in what manner arelo 14 sick children ' sent to the nearest government clinic ' ? Do they, in their sick condition, walk the many miles which lie between their villages and the nearest clinic, or are vehicles provided ? And by whom are the sick children ''sent' ? Certainly not by the schoolmasters, on their own show ing ; nor by the parents, whom the same report describes as being ' very apathetic towards illness.' And how can children be 'sent' at all, if they are really ill ? And finally, are the government clinics equipped in such a way as to be able to provide treatment for 'any condition '? I think that an investigation would show that the sentence which I have quoted is absolutely incorrect. In my opinion, there is no official care at all of the health of schoolchildren in Bahrain. Who is to blame for this state of affairs, and what is the remedy for it? We cannot blame the Government, except perhaps indirectly, through the officials to whom it has entrusted the conduct of education. The Grovern- ment cannot be expected to devote its time to the supervision of the school- children's health. It has provided certain health facilities, notably the local dispenparies, and it was for the school authorities to take the fullest advantage of them. As a first step towards this ihey should have instituted definite health instruction amongst the children, and definite health pro paganda amongst the parents. And they ought in those districts where there are local dispensaries to have created liaisons between dispensary and school. It is no valid excuse for a schoolmaster to plead that parents are ignorant and that children are afraid of doctors. What is a school for, if not to remove, by education, ignorance and superstition ? How can a man call himself an efficient educator and at the same time ignore the fact that education is dependent upon health ? It is not by mere chance that the best schools in Bahrain are those which are situated in the healthier dis tricts : there is a relationship which every schoolmaster must be fully aware of. There is no doubt whatever that the late Inspector and the staffs of the schools are very largely responsible for the wretched state of affairs which I have described. As to remedy, I am afraid I have not much faith in 'weekly inspections' of the schools by a doctor. They will be of little value, in practice ; for the more distant schools are sure to be neglected, like the more distant fields of any farm, and once again Manamah and Muharraq will get most of the attention. In any case, the inspecting doctor, when he arrives at the schools, will be welcomed only by the healthy, or the fairly healthy, since the really sick will all be at home in bed. And even if it were arranged that he should attend them in their homes, it would hardly be reasonable to expect sick children to wait five or six days for the weekly visit of the doctor. In my opinion, the problem of school health in Bahrain will never be satisfactorily solved until the Government decides to appoint a regular, full- time, European doctor—preferably a woman—with Eastern experience and with special qualifications in the treatment of diseases of the eye, one whose sole occupation would be work amongst children, and not only amongst those children who attend bchool, for many juvenile diseases are highly infectious, and we shall not be safeguarding the health of our schoolchildren if at the same time we are neglecting the health of their non-attending companions. Such a doctor as I have described would be able to work out her own scheme for the care of the health of the children of Bahrain—the men and women of tomorrow. I have seen the splendid State Hospital which the Government is erecting at Manamah. It is a venture which would do credit to any State. But one of the cardinal rules of medicine is early treatment, and it seems to me to be illogical and inconsistent for the15 Government to be lavishing so much care and so much money upon the treatment of advanced disease, while doing so little to arrest disease at its source. I am certain that a children's doctor would be a sound invest ment in the end, and I advise your Highness to consider the appointment of one. But if a children's doctor cannot be afforded, or until one can be afforded, a very great deal could be done by the school authorities, working in conjunction with the local dispensaries, always provided that additional dispensaries were built in those villages which have schools but no medical services. I suggest that your Highness should issue firm instructions to the new Inspector, to institute without delay, in all the schools, and himself carefully supervise, a complete and well-thought-out scheme of health supervision—one which will include the keeping by headmasters of the individual health records of every child on their registers, and a routine which will ensure with positive certainty that every child who is absent from school through sickness shall receive medical attention daily until its return. In an earlier part of this Report I have advocated the creation of school-attendance officers, and, in a later part, a certain amount of free time during school hours for headmasters, and these two innovations, if made, would contribute greatly towards the success of the health supervision scheme which I am now urging. Finally, I suggest that, in order to keep the principle of school health clearly and permanently in the minds of schoolmasters and children alike, there should be displayed prominently on the walls of every classroom, in all the schools, a notice to the effect that 'There can be no sound education without sound healt h.'16 The Second serious deficiency of the Bahrain schools is the absence from the curriculum of any kind of Training of Character, as a definite part of the pupil's education. This, again, is a weakness not of your Highness's schools alone, but of schools all over the Middle East. The common conception of education in the Middle East seems to be that the duty of a school is to cram temporarily into the minds of its pupils just enough book-knowledge to enable them to pass some final examination, which will lead, in its turn, to some form of lucrative employment. This is a very low view of education, and one which does not exist any where in England. The duty of a school, in our view, is to prepare children, not for examinations, but for life itself. Life is supposed by us to be a sort of battle, and our aim is to equip our children for it with Character, without which we believe that the battle cannot be fought successfully. In English schools, therefore, the instilling of knowledge from books is a matter of secondary importance—most English parents, indeed, consider it to be a matter of only third importance, since what they demand of the schools is health and character first, and book-knowledge only afterwards. In all branches of English life character is more esteemed than clever ness. When, for example, some important or responsible post is to be filled, those who are making the appointment do not consider very carefully what examinations the candidates may have passed, or what university degrees they may have obtained: they are more concerned to inquire into each man's personal character, and especially into the character which he bore when he was a boy at school; for it is according to character that men behave, and not according to education. Another English belief is that the formation of a boy's character is practically completed by the time he reaches the age of 13 or 14—that after that age character does not change very much. Indeed, one of our greatest poets, of a hundred years ago, has written that ' the child is father to the man What a boy is at 14, he will probably be at 40. It is for this reason that in England we exercise eo much care over the education of our younger pupils. But in the Middle Eastern Schools the case is different. There, it seems to have been forgotten that one who is a liar in his youth will remain a liar in his age ; that he who will cheat in the classroom when he is a boy at school, will cheat in the King's treasury, or in the Customs House, when he is a man. If this is true, your Highness will readily understand why the English schools attach far more importance to the formation of character than to the filling of the mind with knowledge from books. The qualities which are perhaps the most prized in England are : clean liness, sportsmanship, and manners ; truthfulness and honesty ; loyalty ; obedience and discipline ; courage and endurance ; modesty ; fairness and broadmindedness; kindness, generosity, and unselfishness; independence and self-reliance; commonsense; and self-control. These virtues are taught to boys at school in various ways, but chiefly by precept, environment, example, religion, history, literature, and games. In the firm belief that there is no hope, and no future, for those Arab countries which are to-day filling the minds of their young people17 with great quantities of book-learning, without any training of character, I strongly urge upon your Highness the desirability of introducing into the schools of Bahrain definite character-training, as a regular part of their duty and of their routine. I do not mean by this that your Highness's schools should necessarily try to inculcate in the boys all those virtues which I have enumerated above, or that we should try to turn Eastern boys into Western boys. It may be that in Bahrain other and different qualities are preferred or needed. In that case it should be a simple matter for the Edacation authorities, perhaps after consultation with some of the public themselves, to draw up a list of those positive virtues which they would like to see taught in the schools and which they would like to find in the youth of Bahrain after it has finished with school. I suggest that your Highness should ask the Education Department to draw up in writing a definite objective, as regards character-training, which could be supplied to all those who are to be entrusted with the work ; for the great thing is to know exactly what kind of character we wish to form, before we begin to try to form it. The new Inspector, if he is a man of any ability in his profession, will know all about the large literature which is now to be obtained, in many languages, and in the form of school text-books, for the special purpose of training character. These books should be used in the Bahrain schools. If they are not to be found in Arabic, they should be translated into Arabic by the Inspector, for the use of the schools. (The translation of foreign text books into Arabic, for use in Bahrain, will be discussed later in this Eeportj. But books are not enough. There must also be continual precept and continuous example, and these can come only from the teachers themselves. It is therefore of the utmost importance that your Highness should en deavour to engage only such teachers as are of the highest moral character, and who are suitable in every way to serve as examples to the boys under their care.14- 18 The third serious deficiency of the schools of Bahrain is the absence from the curriculum of any kind of Training in Patriotism. One of the objects of the Government in supplying public educa tion is, as we have seen, to provide the State with loyal subjects. But we cannot expect to find loyalty in people unless they have been taught it while they were still childien. Nor do boys' minds become imbued with feelings of loyalty simply because they are attending school. Loyalty and patriotism are virtues which, like any others, have to be first taught and then fostered ; and this involves a conscious effort on the part of the schools, and of the individual schoolmasters. Not only is there a complete abspnce, in the Bahrain schools, of any patriotic influence: there is a definite danger of the loyalties of the children being diverted away from the Island and in the direction of other states. I was astonished to find that the School Song was no other than the national anthem of Syria, and that a number of the exercise-books which were being used by the children bore upon their covers the picture of a foreign ruler, instead of that of the Shaikh of Bahrain. But even more astonishing was the fact that no History of Bahrain for school use had ever been prepared, and that none of the schoolboys had any idea of the shape or the extent of his own Island. No maps of Bahrain were to be seen in the schools, nor was the flag of Bahrain anywhere displayed. I could find on the school walls no photograph of the Island's Ruler, or any provision in the time-table for any.activity designed to lead to the inculcation of loyalty or patriotism. This is a state of affairs which, fortunately, can easily be remedied, for loyalty and patriotism can be taught at school in a number of ways, of which the following would probably be the most successful in Bahrain : (1) A knowledge of the history of Bahrain. (2) A familiarity with the geography of the Island, and some interest in its natural history. (3) Definite instruction about loyalty and patriotism, by means of regular school talks. (4) Reverence for the national flag. (5) The use of pictures of the Ruler. (6) The singing of school and national songs. (7) The wearing of traditional clothes. (8) The removal from the schools of any factor calculated to lead to a feeling of inferiority on the part of Bahrainis as opposed to foreigners. (9) A consciousness of national independence. (10) The stimulation of national ambition. Let us take these ten points one by one.A History of Bahrain. I suggest that your Highness should ask the Education Department to arrange, as soon as possible, for some competent person to write a School History of Bahrain, to be produced in two forms, one suitable as a first reading-book for infants, and the other designed for older boys in the higher classes of the Bahrain schools. Such a history as I have in mind would nob be written on the usual lines of the school his tories prepared in recent years by the educational authorities in some of the Arab states. These so-called histories are without any historical value at all. They consist of long, rambling accounts of legendary exploits, attributed to half-mythical heroes of antiquity, and provide little information about the recent past or the vital present, beyond grossly exaggerated or wholly inaccu rate statements, always redounding to the national glory or the racial credit. Such a history leaves the whole youth of a nation completely in the dark as to the real facts of its past, and does incalculable harm from every point of view. Our History of Bahrain should be a sober and reliable account of the Island's long story, its difficulties and dangers, joys and sorrows, failures and successes. The keynote of the story should be truth, and the scope of the book should extend from the earliest known times down to the present day. It should be written in such a way as to impress its youthful readers with a strong consciousness of the fact that the Bahrainis are a separate, independent, and sovereign people, able to hold their own, as regards anti quity and race-integrity, with any nation in the world. The patriotic idea should be strongly interwoven with the text throughout, and the book should read mure like an interesting tale than like a series of lessons designed for the classroom. The cost of such a work, if it is to be properly done, would certainly not be less than 1,000, and it might be as much as 1,500 rupees. But this expense, I am convinced, is one which would repay itself many times over, in the shape of an informed patriotism and an intelligent loyalty. Nor would the book, of course, be read by the schoolchildren alone : the knowledge contained in it would in due course spread itself all over the Island, and the result of this, to the State, could be nothing but good.20 The Geography of the Island. I suggest that your Highness should ask the Education Department to arrange also for the preparation of large- scale school maps of Bahrain, suitable for hanging on the classroom walls ; and that your Highness should ^ive instructions to the Inspector, as soon as the maps are ready, to iostitute the teaching of local geography, and some natural history, in all the schools for which he is responsible. He should also arrange for occasional school excursions to be made to various parts of the Island, in order to familiarise the boys with the physical nature of their own State.Definite Instruction in Loyalty and Patriotism. This should be provided in the schools by the setting aside in the time-table of one short period each week for the purpose. A definite period is important, since school matters for which there is no specially appointed time are apt to be neglected altogether. During this weekly period the boys should be addressed by the headmaster, or by one of the other masters, on some aspect of loyalty or patriotism—not crudely, or too directly, since this method would probably defeat its own object, but rather with the aim of trying to give the boys some real understanding of the meaning of loyalty and patriotism, and to show them why such virtues are necessary, and how they can be exercised in Bahrain. The period need not be monotonously devoted to drumming into the boys' ears the same ideas, week after week. The time can sometimes be spent in talks about Character, explanations of Island laws and Government decrees, discussions about local or topical matters, etc.—but always with the bias towards national duty and responsibility, national service, national ambition, and national pride. The boys of Bahrain should be made to feel that they are to some extent being taken into the Government's confidence, by being told what the Government is trying to do in the Island, why it is trying to do it, and what are the hoped-for results. Through the schoolmasters as liaison officers, they should also be made to feel that they are being invited by the Government to co-operate, as far as possible, in its efforts to raise the reputation and the prestige of Bahrain ; and once this idea has taken root in their minds they will quickly pass to the next stage, which is a realisation that they themselves have definite parts to play in the national life, entailing duties and responsibilities to the State, and feelings of personal loyalty towards its Ruler. Nor need the speakers always be schoolmasters. Suitable persons from outside the schools should occasionally be invited to give inspirational talks, or to address the boys on some subject connected with Bahrain history, geography, natural history, folk-lore, and so on. But past history, upon which the Arab loves to draw, should not be the sole, or even the chief, source of inspiration : on the contrary, the idea should be impressed upon the boys that no nation can live permanently upon its past, and that national reputation and prestige are things which are connected almost entirely with the living facts of the present. The response of the boys to the kind of treatment which I am sugges t- ing is a foregone conclusion, for youth is always generous, and always anxious to serve : but youth must be given a lead, and must be shown what it can do to help. I therefore suggest that your Highness should order to be instituted in the schools the definite instruction in loyalty and patriotism which I have tried to describe.22 Reverence for the National Flag. I suggest that your Highness should give instructions that the flag of Bahrain should be prominentlv displayed in all the schools, and that the schoolmasters should make an effort to bring about in the minds of the boys a feeling of reverence for it as a symbol of loyalty, patriotism, and national pride. The best effect Irom the display of the national flag will be obtained if at the same time there could be shown, by means of coloured charts, or some other form of illustration, the national flags of other countries. This will induce m the boys' minds the feeling that Bahrain, in this respect, is on an absolute equality with the other nations.23 The Use of Pictures of the Kuler. I suggest that your Highness should be so kind as to present to the schools suitable photographs of the Ruler of Bahrain, of convenient size and suitably framed, for display on the school walls. Also that your Highness should ask the Education Department to arrange for your Highness's likeness to be printed on the covers of all the exercise-books used in the schools of Bahrain.24 The SiDging of School and National Songs. I do not know whether any of the folk-songs of Bahrain have ever been set to music and printed, or whether there is any existing song, of a patriotic nature, well known all over the Island, which would be suitable as a national anthem for Bahrain. If there is such a song, it would be a good thing to have it properly set to music and_ introduced into the schools at once: if not perhaps someone could be induced to write a national anthem, chiefly for school use. In any case, I suggest that your Highness should absolutely forbid the use of the Syrian National Authem in the schools of Bahrain. The singing of folk-songs is a powerful influence towards patriotism, but, quite apart from this, it would be an excellent thing if the many folk-songs of Bahrain, some of which can be heard sung on the pearling- boats, could be collected by some competent person, set to the correct music, and printed. They could thus be permanently preserved, before it is too late, and such a collection would be of the utmost national, historical, and ethnological value. I wonder whether your Highness would consider asking the Education Department to try to appoint a small committee of knowledgeable persons to examine the whole question of the traditional songs of Bahrain, both from the national point of view and from that of the need for a song-book in the schools.25 The Wearing of Traditional Clothes. It was a great pleasure to find that Bahrain schoolboys still wear the national dress, and that no one has so far suggested that this should be given up in favour of foreign clothes. The Arab dress, unchanged for many centuries, has been found by long experience to be the most suitable form of clothing for the climates in which the Arabs live, and the wearing of traditional clothes has always been one of the strongest incentives to patriotism and national pride. The boys of Bahrain should therefore on no account be allowed to fall into the prevailing error of despising their ancestral dress, but should be taught to reverence it, to keep it spotlessly clean, and to wear it with dignity, grace, and pride. I strongly advise your Highness to oppose any suggestion that may be made in favour of discontinuing the wearing by Bahrain schoolboys of the traditional clothes.26 Inferiority Complex. Among the various methods of fostering patriot ism listed above is mentioned the removal from the schools of any factor likely to lead to a feeling of inferiority on the part of Bahrainis, as opposed to foreigners. This was included because in the course of my visits to the schools I could not fail to notice a number of small but unmis takable indications of the fact that the Syrian teachers have somehow or other managed to establish a most undesirable ascendancy over the Bahraini teachers. The latter were quite overshadowed by the former, and, I thought, overawed by them : at all events, the Bahrainis were given no chance, while I was there, of expressing their views, or of asserting themselves in nny way. I do not wish to say much about this matter, except that steps ought to be taken by the new Inspector to bring it to an end as soon as possible; for a feeling of inferiority on the part of the Bahraini masters cannot fail to communicate itself to the Bahraini boys, and this must militate against the very thing which we are trying to bring about, a consciousness of national pride, which is one of the foundations of patriotism. It goes almost without saying that there should at the very least be complete equality between Bahraini masters and Syrian masters, and if the suggestions which I am making later in this Eeport (about better pay and further education for the Bahraini masters) are adopted, they should go far towards facilitating this feeling of complete equality. I suggest that your Highness should direct the Education Department to ask the new Inspector to keep a vigilant eye on the whole matter of Bahraini and Syrian equality in the schools.27 Consciousness of National Independence. It is absolutely essential, if patriotism in the boys is to be developed to the fullest degree, that they should be given a strong consciousness of national independence. This consciousness cannot exist side by side with a slavish imitation of the methods and institutions of other countries. Again and again, while I was visiting the schools, and especially whenever I had cause to point out somp fault or weakness in the educational system, I was met with the rejoinder : 'But this is what is done in ' Iraq.' But ' Iraq is one of the youngest of the nations, still experimenting with her new-found liberty, while Bahrain has behind her a long history of freedom and independence, and it is therefore not fitting that the older State should be continually looking to the younger for guidance and for example. I think there is no doubt whatever that this dependent attitude has been imported into the Bahrain schools by the Syrian teachers, and unless we put an early stop to it we cannot expect to find, or to be able to develop, an independent outlook on bhe part of the boys. Quite apart from this, since our aim is to establish in Bahrain a superior type of education, there can be little in the educational systems of neighbouring countries which would be worth copying. I suggest that firm instructions should be given by your Highness that the new Inspector shall do his utmost to stamp out in the schools this wholly undesirable tendency to look to and to lean upon neighbouring states, in matters which are the concern of Bahrain alone. The boys should be taught that Bahrain is fully capable of standing on her own feet, and of planning and conducting her own institutions in her own way. Their minds should be impressed with a strong consciousness of national independence and national self-reliance, and if this can be done, we shall be a long way on the road towards the fullest degree of patriotism.28 The Stimulation of National Ambition. I think that if we could hold up before the schoolboys of Bahrain some national ambition, one which they could readily understand, and in which they could personally co operate, we should be able to bring about in them the highest degree of patriotism. Is there any ideal picture, or future goal, which would capture their imaginations, fire their enthusiasm, and enlist their e^ger suport ? I believe there is such a picture. It is the picture of their Island as the cul tural, educational, medical, architectural, and commercial centre of the Persian Gulf—the picture of Bahrain as the unquestioned leader of all the Gulf States, their exemplar and guide, foremost in development, and para mount in prestige. This is an ambition which every schoolboy would be able to understand, and one in which no schoolboy would feel himself too young or too insignificant to play his part. It is not for me to suggest national ambitions for Bahrain : but something of the sort there must be, if we are to have the highest degree of patriotism in our young people, and the ambition which I have described is the one which comes most readily to mind : for it seems to me that all the necessary factors are present, all the conditions are conducive, the moment is ripe, and the stars are propitious, for such a move by Bahrain. To make herself undisputed leader of the Gulf States, instead of to remain a junior member of a more scattered combina tion with which she has so little in common, is a task well within her powers, and if she would adopt it as a national ambition she would provide her youth with something to work for and to live for, and we should find no lack of patriotism in the schools.29 Having considered the only serious deficiencies in the present school curriculum, we m^y now turn to the question of Policy. What subjects shall we teach our boys, and within what framework shall the teaching be given ? As to the framework, most fortunately the policy which I wish to recommend does not entail any extensive alteration of the existing scheme, except, of course, the building of three entirely separate infants' schools, an innovation which I regard as a sine qua non to any substantial improve ment in the standard of education at Bahrain. What I propose to your Highness is as follows : We make 9 years the full educational life of a boy in a Government school, and we divide up those 9 years into three equal periods, or Stages, of 3 years each. We call these the First, or Infants' Stage; the Second, or Intermediate Stage; and the Third, or Final Stage. We allot one Class to each year of education. The lowest Class in an Infants' School is the First Class, and the highest Class in a Final Stage School is the Ninth Class. We make the existing schools at Manamah, Muharraq, and Hedd into Intermediate and Final schools (containing, therefore. Classes 4 to 9), and we make the existing schools at Suq-al-Khamis, Kufa'a, Budaya, and Sitra into Infants' and Intermediate schools (containing, therefore, Classes 1 to 6). This leaves us with no Infants' accomodation at Manamah, Muharraq, and Hedd, and no Final Stage accomodation at the four village schools. To correct this, we build First Stage, or Infants' schools at Manamah, Muharraq, and Hedd, and if there are any boys at any of the four village schools who seem worth educating into the Final Stage we transfer them, for the last three years of their education, to one or other of the Final Stage schools, under a scheme which I shall outline later. We bear in mind, as a first principle, that no time, money, or effort is to be wasted in trying to educate boys who are not educable. With this in view, we lay down the following rules: We refuse to allow any boy, under any circumstances whatsoever, to enter a First Stage, or Infants' school until he has reached the age of 6. We refuse to allow any boy in an Infants' school to spend more than four years in completing its 3-year course. W T e refuse to allow any boy to enter a Second Stage, or Intermediate school unless he has passed the Final Examination of the First Sta^e, or Infants' school. (This means that any infant who is weak or backward at the end of his third year, and so fails in his final examination, will be given one further chance; but it also means that if he is so weak or so backward as to be unable to pass the final examination at the end of the fourth year, his education is finished, and he ceases to be an expense to the State or a drag on the work of the schools.-) We refuse to allow any boy in a Second Stage, or Intermediate school to spend more than four years in completing its 3-year course. We refuse to allow any boy to enter a Third Stage, or Final school— even if he has passed the final examination of the Stage below—unless we consider him to be really worth higher education. In other words, only the pick of all the boys in the Island will be allowed by us to enter a Third30 Stage, or Final school at all. All the others finish their education and leave school at the end of three (or, at the most, four) years in the Second Stage. Under this scheme, the total school life of a really dull or really backward boy could not possibly last more than four years (age 6—10), and the school life of a not very bright boy could not possibly last more than 8 years (age 6—14). The boy of only average intelligence would finish hia education in six years (age 6—12), since he would get through each of the first two Stages in three years. The really bright boys would finish their education in nine years (age 6—15), since, although they would be al lowed to proceed to the Final Stage, they would get through each of the three Stages in three years. And if 15 seems to be too tender an age at which education should finish, it should be borne in mind that if these and all the other suggestions which I am making are adopted, the future really bright Bahrain boy will be much better educated at the age of 15 than the present really bright Bahrain boy can be, under the present system, at 17 or 18. Furthermore, the future really bright Bahrain boy will be able to leave school at the age of 15 without it being felt by anyone concerned that he has left too soon. We make all First Stage and all Second Stage education free education, and we require that all Final Stage education shall be paid for, either by the parents, or, in the case of deserving poor boys, by the Government. That is to say, poor boys who show exceptional promise at the end of the Second Stage are awarded Government scholarships, which carry them through the remaining three years of their education, at a Final Stage school. We institute Final Examinations, to be held at the end of each year, for all boys who have reached the end of their Stage, and we issue Govern ment certificates to those who pass them. We also issue Certificates of Sufficient Education to every boy who, through final failure in a Final Examination, is unable to obtain from the Government any further education. This certificate states that there is no objection, on educa tional grounds, to its holder being employed immediately. (Such certificates will be necessary in view of the agreement with the Oil Company, which undertakes not to employ any schoolboy who cannot produce a certificate of sufficient education). We enlarge all of the four village schools, in such a way that each one contains six distinct and separate classrooms, each capable of holding comfortably a maximum of 30 boys (though this is really too many for a Class), and we draft into each of the village schools properly qualified masters, capable of taking the boys to the end of the Second Stage (6th Class). If it is in any way possible, we build headmasters' houses, adjoining or attached to the schools themselves. If this is not possible, we require the headmasters at least to reside in the villages in which their schools are situated. We standardise the teaching curricula of all the schools of Bahrain, so that the standard of the Second Stage, Class 5, at Sitra, for example, will be exactly the same as that of the corresponding Class at, for example, Manamah or Hedd. We use exactly the same books in every school, irrespective of locality. We cease to pay higher salaries to those who teach in town schools and lower salaries to those who teach in the country: if any distinction is to be made, we make it in favour of those schoolmasters who are prepared to isolate themselves in the distant villages, rather than to cling to the comforts of the town.■31 So much for the framework. What subjects shall we teach ? The educational problem in Bahrain is not a normal one. The discovery of oil, and tho advent of the Oil Company, have raised problems which are peculiar to Bahrain. The Government's purpose in supplying the public with free education is, as we have seen, 'to provide the State with loyal and useful subjects, and to provide those subjects with something of value to them selves'. The aim of the public, in making use of what is supplied, is not on quite so high a plane. I could not find, anywhere in the Island, any sign whatsoever of a desire for education for its own sake. The point of view of everyone with whom I talked—even that of the schoolmasters- seemed to bo that education is required in Bahrain solely as a means to an end the end being a lucrative post with the Oil Company. And when one considers the conditions of grinding poverty under which the majority of the people are living, this is a view of education which cannot be too hastily condemned. To the Island has come great and unexpected wealth, and it is perhaps only reasonable that the people of the Island should be looking for their fair share of it. Such is the view of the public, and it is this view which guides their strictly utilitarian attitude towards education. But governments have obligations towards peoples, and are not bound always to fall in with the popular view. I think that what we should aim at, in Bahrain, is a com promise between the higher purpose of the G-overnment and the lower requirements of the public. I think we should try to equip our boys physically and mentally for the posts which they covet, while at the same time giving them something of higher value in addition, something which will stand them in good stead all their lives, whether they happen to be in employment or not. What form of education is likely to accomplish all this, in the comparatively short time at our disposal ? I think the great principles to keep in mind are that a few branches of knowledge, properly mastered, are far better than twice as many only half digested, and that character is as valuable in life as learning. There has, I know, been much talk in Bahrain about the need for 'secondary education'. A great deal was said to me on the subject while I was visiting the schools, by the schoolmasters. They spoke of the desirabil ity of establishing 'secondary classes' in the existing schools, of the need for a 'secondary school' in Manamah, and of the need for 'evening second ary education'. I did not, and still do not, understand what was meant by all this talk of secondary education in Bahrain, for secondary education already exists there, in at least three of the schools. Primary education means the teaching of children to reid, to write, to add, to multiply, to divide, and to subtract, and nothing else. Anything beyond this is secondary education. The learning of foreign languages is most certainly secondary education, and a foreign language (English) is taught to all the boys at the schools of Manamah, Muharraq, and Hedd, except in the very lowest classes, and even in these the infants are taught the English letters of the alphabet, side by side with the Arabic. The boys in the schools which I have mentioned are being taught other subjects also which are far from being primary subjects. I feel that those who are agitating for ' secondary education ' are allowing themselves to be mesmer ised by words, rather than being guided by facts.32 Bnt if, wben they ask for ' secondary education', these people mean that they want the boys of Bahrain to be taught all of the twelve, thirteen, or fourteen subjects which the 'secondary schools' of some of the Arab states endeavour to cram into their schoolboys, no greater mistake could possibly be made. I have seen a good deal of this kind of ' educa tion ', and I can assure those who are asking for the same sort of thing in Bahrain that its results are deplorable. What happens is this : While the European boy is studyiner seven, or at most eight, subjects at his secondary school, the Arab boy of the same age, in some of these Middle Eastern schools, is proudly ' studying ' as many as fourteen. He calls it studying, but no boy in the world can properly study fourteen subjects together, and the Arab boy, in reality, is only learning by heart, and cramming into an uncomprehending mind, a great mass of isolated facts, which he thinks may be of use to him in some future examination. When these two boys eventually leave school, the European boy knows his few subjects really well, while the Arab boy is left with a mere smattering of a large number of subjects which he has never properly grasped. I myself know of an Arab State in whose highest 'secondary school' the subject of Chemistry has actually been 'studied' for two years without apparatus of any kind, and •without any chemicals. The only form of equipment was a Chemistry book. Such a state of affairs would be laughable, were it not almost tragic. Again, in Europe a boy's education is made to fib his future career, and after he has reached the a^e of about fourteen his school studies include only such subjects as are likely to be of future use to him ; whereas in the East every boy in these strange ' secondary schools' is made to study every subject on the programme, even though not one student out of ten will ever find an opportunity of making use of such knowledge after he has left school. There is no reason why Bahrain should make the same mistakes as are being made elsewhere, by slavishly following what is being done in other countries. Especially should Bahrain beware of taking as examples the educational systems which are now in vogue in the Middle East, for these systems are very far from being fuccessful, or even satisfactory. The results, as I have said, are often deplorable. Let us plan for Bahrain an educational policy to suit Bahrain, and pay no attention at all to what our neighbours are doing. Bearing in mind all the relevant factors, I consider the following pro gramme of education to be the most suitable for the Government schools of your Highness's State, and I recommend your Highness to adopt it: The child begins his educational life at the age of 6, by entering one of the First Stage, or Infants' schools. There he receives Religious Instruc tion and Training in Character, and learns to read and to write Arabic. He learns Arabic Arithmetic—the Four Rules only. He is given a great deal of Manual Occupation, of the Kindergarten kind, and he is taught Drawing. He receives Health Instruction and he undergoes Physical Drill. He takes part in Class Singing. He is taught nothing else whatsoever, but he picks up indirectly an elementary knowledge of the History and the Geography of his Island, through one of his reading-books—the Infants' Version of the History of Bahrain, which has already been discussed. His course in the First Stage lasts three years (extensible to four), and the Classes in which he sits are Nos. 1, 2, and 3. The Second, or Intermediate Stage of school life (the final Stage for all but the re illy bright boys) is spent in the three lower classes of the regular boys' schools, in the case of Manamah, Muharraq, or Hedd, or inthe three higher classes in the case of the village schools. The boy con tinues to receive Religious Instruction and Character Training. He begins to study Arabic as a language, not merely as a mediam of reading or writing. As soon as he enters the Stage he starts to learn one foreign language, English. He passes to higher branches of Arithmetic, parti cularly the arithmetic of Money, and he masters the various currencies in use in Bahrain. He studies elementary World History and World Geography. He gives up manual occupations of the kindergarten kind, but continues his Drawing, and he makes a closer study of Sanitation and Health. He receives an increased amount of Physical Training. Singing is still included. He studies the History of Bahrain in much fuller detail. The classes in which he sits are Nos. 4, 5, and 6. At the end of his time in a Second Stage school the boy's age is either 12, 18, or 14, according to the degree of intelligence which he has displayed in that and the previous Stage. Unless he is one of the really bright boys, he now leaves school finally, having obtained a sound general education up to a limited (but not very limited) standard. He will be able to speak, read, and write, in good and fluent Arabic, and will know how to manage his money affairs without being cheated. He will have a working know ledge of English. He will know well the history of his Island, and will have quite a fair idea of the history and the geography of the world. He will be able to draw. He will know a good deal about sanitation and health, and will have undergone at least six years' physical training. He will also have received at last six years' religious instruction and six years' character-training. We can give him when he leaves a Lower Certificate of General Education. The curriculum of Final Stage education carries to higher levels the general education of the Second Stage, but includes additions. It is definitely designed and adapted to fit boys for responsible posts in Govern ment offices, with the Oil Company, and in banks and business houses, but it must also be suitable for those boys who wish to proceed to higher education in colleges or universities abroad, or in Bahrain itself, if at some later date a Higher College or University should be established there. In his Third, or Final Stage, the study of the Qur'an and the Training of Character continues. Much attention is now devoted to the study of English, but on no account is this allowed to prejudice the study of Arabic (an important matter, which is discussed later in this Report). Simplified versions of the English classics are read, and the boys are prepared for a foreign examina tion in English, such as the examination for the Cambridge Certificate of Proficiency in English. To Arithmetic are now added elementary Algebra and Geometry, and very elementary Science—chiefly Physics. World History and World Geography are studied in greater detail. There is now instruction in Civics, and there is a class for Bookkeeping. To the student's previous knowledge of Sanitation and Health we add a little simple Biology. Physical Training continues. The curriculum of the Final Stage should, however, be anything but a rigid one : on the contrary, the Inspector should from time to time alter and adapt it, by the introduction of any subject or subjects which he finds have been made necessary by the demands of employers, or by the nature of the various forms of employment which seem to be opening themselves out to pupils from the schools: and other subjects, which he finds impractical or unnecessary he should omit; for, above all, education at Bahrain must have its practical side, suited to the needs of the Island, and of the boys who are being educated. At the end of the Final Stage, we can give the pupil a Higher Certificate of General Education.34 It is much to be hoped that at some time in the near future the Government may be able to see its way clear for the establishment in Bahrain of a Higher College, or University. But it cannot be too strongly emphasised that an absolutely necessary first step to such a scheme is a substantial improvement in the standard of the education given in the existing schools. Without that, our Higher College or University would be almost useless, since Higher Education can only be built upon a sound foundation of Lower Education.35 We now come to the important question of Control. Since the departure of the late Inspector, there has been no central control of the schools of Bahrain, and where there is no central control there can of course be no unity of purpose and no uniformity of practice. Furthermore, the many radical changes which are necessary in all the schools except the Technical School, and the many improvements and innovations which I am suggpsting, through this Eeport, that your Highness should make, can hardly be carried out at all except by some central authority, and one which is capable of exercising constant supervision. I therefore consider it to be of the highest importance that Bahrain education should be supplied at the earliest possible moment with efficient central control. What form should this control take ? In my opinion, the ideal would be for your Highness to appoint a British director of education, with an Asiatic assistant, or mufettish, to work with him. But a British director would be an expensive appointment, and if it is one that cannot be afforded, then the next best thing would be to appoint a new mufettish alone, as soon as possible. This man should be well-educated and broadminded, with good educational qualifications, really interested in education and possessed of some experience of European education, or, failing that, of American education. A Lebanese or a Palestinian would probably suit Bahrain better than a Syrian, and the best choice of all would be a man who has all or most of the above qualifications, but who has in addition a lively appreciation of all the shams and absurdities of some of the Middle Eastern systems of educa tion : for such a man would know what to avoid in Bahrain, and would certainly find himself in agreement with most of the educational ideas formulated in this Keport. The kind of man whom we do not want is one who would come to the Island in a spirit of superiority, or one who would look upon his post merely as an opportunity of providing his friends with lucrative posts. What we need is an earnest-minded man, who will come prepared to subscribe to the policy of Bahrain for the Bahrainis, and who will plan things in such a way that after a few years it will be possible to recruit the whole of the teaching staff for the schools from the Island itself. Such a man as I have described could hardly be secured at a salary of less than about 500 rupees per month. I should suggest that he be given a four-year or five-year contract, with small yearly increases in salary, but that his contract should be strictly terminable at short notice if it were found by the Government that the necessary reforms were not being instituted, or maintained, or that the educational standard did not improve, or that the Mufettish himself proved to be not strong enough in personal character to control his subordinates and to put an end to that most undesirable ascendancy of foreign teachers over native teachers, to which I have already referred. I respectfully advise your Highness to appoint as soon as possible either a British director of education and a new mufettish, or else a new mufettish alone. And if your Highness's choice falls upon a new mufettish alone, I further advise that the Education Department be asked to employ at the end of each school year the services of a competent outside examiner, whose duty it would be to set, or at any rate to approve, all the examination questions to be answered by the boys in the final examinations of each Stage, and also to correct, or at any rate to supervise the correction36 of all the papers returned by them. This Examiner would also conduct all the final examinations in person, and would therefore need to spend about a fortnight in the Island. The appointment of an outside examiner is, in my opinion, the only way of making impossible the setting of childish examination-questions by teachers who are afraid of seeing their pupils fail, and the gross overmark- ing of the candidates' answers by teachers, for the same reason. After all, our educational scheme is almost wholly dependent upon honest examina tions, and honest examinations are the only sure means we possess of testing the ability of the teachers as well as that of the taught. Finally, without honest examinations our certificates of education, about which we are going to take so much trouble, will be worthless.I was told when I was in Bahrain that a number of people were pressing for the formation of an Educational Committee, to consist of the new Mufettish, the headmasters of the schools, some of the parents, and a number of people interested in education, though not actually connected with it. The suggestion was that all important educational matters should be brought before this Committee, for discussion and for decision, and that all the actions of the Mufettish should be subject to its approval. I am quite definitely against any such arrangement. I know that such committees are to be found in the educational systems of most of the Arab countries, and I regard them as one of the curses of Eastern education. In this matter of responsibility. Eastern and Western practices are at opposite poles. In the Eastern world we find the responsible official looking always for the help and the support of others, in every step which he takes ; fearing to stand alone, or to act upon his own judgement ; fearing above all to make an unpopular decision. In the West, when once we have chosen a man to become a responsible public servant, and have told him what we want him to do, we leave him alone to carry out his work in his own way. It may happen that, later on, we find that we have made a mistake, and have chosen the wrong man. In that case we dismiss him quickly, and choose another. But so long as we employ him, we trust him; we leave the whole of the matter in his hands; and we refrain from interfering with him. This system is a source of strength to any State which employs it, for it brings out in public officials the quality of self- reliance, and forces them to think, instead of merely to obey. It leads to singleness of aim, to uniformity of practice, and to quickness and certainty of decision, and all these things make for bold government. But committees are a source of weakness. They lead to diversity of aim, and to vacillation of policy. Committees breed weak officials. Committees mean much talk and little action. What is the use of employing a Mufettish, if he is to become im mediately answerable to a committee, some of whose members are his own subordinates ? A Mufettish is in the same position as the captain of a ship. He is steering the educational vessel towards the appointed port. A ship's captain is not subject to a committee : he is absolute master of the craft in which he sails, free to make any decision which he considers need ful, and answerable only to those who are paying him his wages. And so it should be with your Highness's Mufettish. I advise your Highness not to consent to the appointment of the proposed Committee.38 Having dealt with the question of control, we can now turn to matters relating to the Teaching Staff. The first point is about the Necessity for a Teachers' Training School. It is highly desirable, fronQ many points of view, that Bahraini boya should be taught exclusively by Bahraini masters. Unfortunately such s change cannot be made immediately, since there are at present not enough sufficiently-educated Bahraini teachers to fill all the posts at the schools. But what can be made immediately is a beginning. We can start at once to train some of the brightest and best-conducted of the boys at our schools to become schoolmasters, and we can also start at once to give some of the present Bahraini teachers at the schools a higher education than that which they now possess. There is nothing to be gained by sending the young men who are to be trained as schoolmasters to any of the neighbouring Arab states, for in Bahrain we are aiming at something superior to anything that exists in those states. The other alternatives are Europe, India, and Bahrain itself. Europa would be very expensive, and India has disadvantages, though the education there is pretty good : from all points of view I am strongly in favour of training Bahrain teachers in Bahrain itself. What we need is a very small Teachers' Training School, run under the personal direction of the Inspector, and staffed by the best of the teach ers at the other schools. The school should be an evening school exclusively, since such an arrangement would make it possible for some of the present Bahraini masters to attend it as pupils, and for some of the present S&gt;rian masters to attend it as teachers. But we are going to find it impossible to persuade Bahrain schoolboys to offer themselves as trainees at such a school unless we are prepared to make a teaching career in Bahrain an attractive one financially. Nor are we going to be able to persuade Bahraini masters to undergo further educa tion at the hands of their Syrian colleagues unless we are prepared to hold out to them a concrete, financial attraction in the form of an increase in salary for those who improve their present education to such an extent as to become definitely more efficient schoolmasters, and therefore more useful public servants, than they were before. I suggest that your Highness should ask the Education Department to work out as soon as possible a simple scheme for an evening teachers' training school, on the above lines. The sooner this is done, the nearer we shall be to the desired day when the teaching staffs at all the Bahrain schools will be one hundred per cent Bahraini.39 The next point to be noted is that the Teaching Hours—at any rate in the three town schools—are far too long. It is quite impossible for any schoolmaster to give efficient service if he is expected to teach large classes for 36 hours a week. For headmasters especially, such an arrangement is quite absurd, since it leaves them no time for essential school work which is unconnected with the classroom. I have never heard of any other educa tional system where such long hours of work are demanded of the teachers. In Egypt and Iraq, for example, the weekly average is 24 hours, with 26 as an exceptional maximum. I do not know who is responsible for the present arrangement in Bahrain, but it ought to be rectified at once, for such a programme can only lead ultimately to inefficiency on the part of the teachers and to utter boredom on the part of the taught. I recommend that your Highness should issue an order to the effect that no assistant master in a Governmeut school shall be required to teach for more than 28 periods (not hours) in any week, and that no headmaster shall be required to teach for more than 18 periods in any week, and that if the needs of education demand that any master shall teach beyond these limits, his extra services shall be utilised only in the evening, with his own consent, and on the understanding that he receives extra pay for his work, at rates to be determined by the Education Department.40 The next point is with regard to Salaries. Earlier in this Report I have alluded to the great discrepancifs with exist between the salaries paid to the Syrian teachers, and those paid to the local men. In my opinion, there is no justification for this state of affairs: and it has undoubtedly contributed towards the feeling of inferiority amongst the Bahraini teachers. I am not forgetting that the Syrian teachers are holders of universit) 7 degrees, and that the Bahrainis are not : but teaching ability does not depend upon the possession of a university degree. A Bahraini who has never been out of the Island may be just as good n. teacher, and therefore just as useful a public servant, as a foreigner who has obtained academic qualifications at two universities. I do not suggest that the salaries of the Syrian teachers should be lowered—thpy are not very high, compared with those paid in neighbouring states - or that the salaries of the Bahrainis should be raised to exactly the same level as those of the Syrians. The Syrians have certain expenses to meet which do not apply to local men : they have to travel, and their boarding expenses in Bahrain must of necessity be higher than those of the teachers who are living in their own homes. What I do suggest to your Highness is that the salaries of the local men should be brought appreciably nearer to those of the foreign teachers, not only from the point of view of justice, but also in the interests of a proper feeling of national pride on the part of the Bahrainis. Furthermore, it is highly desirable that the Education Department, with the assistance of the Inspector, should draw up a regular fixed scale of salaries for all the schools in Bahrain. The present state of affairs as regards salaries, as far as I was able to understand it, is a completely chaotic one, and one which is full of anomalies and injustices. It is not for me to suggest what salaries should be paid to individual teachers, but the common practice of most professions seems to demand that to some extent they should be proportionate to length of service, and to degree of responsibility carried. It ought to go without saying that headmasters, for example, should receive more than assistant masters, yet a glance at the salary-list will show that this is far from being the practice in Bahrain. I strongly advise your Highness to have a regular and equitable scale of salaries for teachers drawn up and instituted at an early date. In addition to, and quite apart from, the smaller question of the anomalies which exist between the salaries of Bahrainis and Syrians, between headmasters and assistant masters, and between public servants of long standing and those who are just beginning their public service, the whole question of the adequacy or otherwise of teachers' salaries in Bahrain ought to be looked into. The salaries paid to teachers in Bahrain are very low, and the question arises as to whether we shall ever be able to achieve the maximum improvement in Bahrain education unless we decide to raise the whole standard and prestige of the teaching profession in the Island, by improving upon the present basis of payment. Earlier in this Report I have suggested a scheme under which, in a few years' time, the teaching staffs of the Bahrain schools will have become a hundred per cent Bahraini: but this can hardly happen so long as the present salary basis persists, for unless we are prepared to pay our teachers properly we shall never be able to persuade the best of the Bahrain schoolboys to consider taking up teaching as a career. The rival attractions will be, financially, too strong. I therefore further advise your Highness to ask the Education Department to consider at an early date the wider question of the adequacy or otherwise of all the payments at present being made to schoolmasters in Bahrain. Just by way of a guide in any such enquiry, it may be mentioned here that while the headmaster^7 41 of a village school draws a monthly salary of 40 rupees, any one of his own quite young pupils can walk out of the school and obtain an unskilled Oil Company post at a commencing salary of 35.42 riiB next point refers to the Clothes to be Worn by Foreign Teachers in talnp fn Bahr r; Elsewhere in this Eeport I have discussed the JwTi P^pos® 8 of fostering patriotism, of the wearing of traditional all tvf' If 6 s . u 8g estetl 'bat Arab clothes should be worn in school by all the boys except those at the Technical School. But the full benefit y be eDdan g ered if we permit the anomaly of boys being required to wear Arab dress, while masters are going about n European dress. J therefore recommend that your Highness should include the teachers in the rule about the wearing of traditional clothes43 The next point is about Secret Eeports. By these I mean accusations or complaints, written by superiors about their subordinates, and sent without their knowledge to higher authority. The secret report, which flourishes in all the Arab educational systems, is from every point of view an odious and unworthy institution. It does harm to the characters of all concerned, for it breeds servility and hypocrisy in subordinates, and fosters partiality, vindictiveness, and injustice in superiors. I want to suggest that your Highness should adopt in the schools of Bahrain the English system of open reports. This system requires that if a subordinate is to be complained about verbally, he must himself be present when the complaint is made, and he has the right, then and there, to make his defence ; and that if he is to be complained about in writing, he must be shown all that has been written about him, and he has the right, if he disagrees with what has been said, to add, on the same sheet of paper, his own version of the matter. In any case, he must be required to add his signature at the foot of the report, as evidence that it has been shown to him. In the interests of fair and just administration, it would be a wise act for your Highness to issue an order to the effect that no verbal complaint shall be heard by the Education Department, or by the Inspector, unless the person complained about is present, and that any written complaint which reaches those authorities without bearing upon it the signature of the subordinate concerned shall be put into the waste-paper-basket unread. If this is done, we shall very quickly witness a franker and more healthy atmosphere amongst the teaching staff, and a more satisfactory relationship between the teaching staff and the Inspector. For reasons which I have already discussed, this innovation would be of special help and benefit to hose of the teachers who are Bahrainis.44 A word must be said about the need for a Teacher of Hebrew. There are at Manamah School about 40 Jewish boys, and no provision has been made for their instruction in Hebrew. It is highly desirable, both on grounds of justice, and on cultural grounds, that this should be remedied. I suggest that your Highness should give instructions for a full-time or part-time teacher of Hebrew to be engaged as soon as possible for Manamah School, and that facilities should be given for any Jewish boys at Muharraq or Hedd to be transferred, if their parents wish it, to Manamah. It would be an advantage if the teacher engaged were a well-educated Jew already resident in Bahrain.45 The final point is about the Future Recruitment of Teachers, so long as it remains necessary to recruit teachers for Bahrain from abroad. As far as I was able, when I was visiting the schools, I observed very carefully the men who are now employed, and a few days later I had an opportunity of comparing them with the teachers who are employed in the schools of Kuwait. In my opinion, some of the teachers employed in Bahrain are very much too young, and therefore inexperienced. Such men must of necessity be merely experimenting with education, at the expense of their pupils. To make matters worse, the less experienced of the teachers have in general been allotted to the more junior classes, which, as I have already shown, are the most important classes in the whole system. This could never have happened if experienced teachers alone had been engaged. There is a further danger of engaging for our boys teachers who have themselves been educated, or who have obtained their teaching experience, under the wrong methods I mean in Middle Eastern schools not run on European lines. Such teachers cannot fail to pass on to their pupils the mistaken ideas upon which their own education has been based. Then there is the danger of importing into Bahrain teachers who may attempt to ^ engage in political activities, side by side with their school duties. This is from all points of view utterly undesirable. Finally, we have seen the damage which is done by the foreigner who adopts an attitude of superiority towards the natives of the country to which he comes as a teacher. Taking all these things into consideration, I think that your Highness's Education Department would be wise, when foreign teachers are being engaged in the future, to proceed according to the following rules : (1) Never engage a teacher who is very young, or who has little teaching experience. (2) Never engage a teacher who has himself been educated, or whose sole teaching experience has been gained, in government schools in Egypt or in Iraq, since the education systems of those countries, and the methods employed, are unsuitable for Bahrain. (3) Endeavour, by making careful enquiries before appointment, to avoid engaging the kind of teacher who will dabble in politics or adopt a superior attitude towards the natives after he gets to Bahrain. The above rules are merely negative. We can add two positive ones : (4) If Syria is to be drawn upon at all, try to engage a Lebanese rather than a true Syrian, since the former will probably be46 the more cultured, the better educated, and the less politically minded—especially if he has been educated in a European- type school. (5) Bear in mind that probably the best foreign teacher of all, for Bahrain's purposes, would be the Palestinian Arab who could satisfy the following conditions : {a) He has himself been educated at a British-conducted school in Palestine, i.e. either a government school or one of the British-owned private schools. (Jb) He has had a few years' teaching experience in a school of the type described in (a). (c) He has never taught in any school outside Palestine. (d) He can be recommended to the Bahrain Adviserate, by the Palestine Secretariat, as being a suitable teacher, both as regards abstention from politics, and probable outlook after he reaches Bahrain.47 I do not intend to write much in this Report about Methods of Teaching, since method, as we have already seen, comes within the province of the Director of Education, or, if there is no director of education, within the province of the Inspector. But some of the methods which I saw being used in the schools of Bahrain were so crude, or so mistaken, that I feel it my duty to mention them, in order that their future use may be forbidden. It is much to be hoped that the new controller, whoever he may be, will make it one of his first duties to carry out a thorough examination of the methods of teaching now in use in Bahrain, and that he will ruthlessly abolish all antiquated methods in favour of modern ones. First about the Teaching of Reading. I saw at some of the schools numbers of little boys, who had barely mastered their letters, being taught to read from the Qur'an. But the Qur'an was not written as a reading-book for little boys. It is not scientifically arranged as a school reader, starting with simple syllables and easy words, and gradually, page by page, employing more difficult words, to suit the increasing knowledge and ability of the pupil. To use a Qur'an as a means of teaching a child to read is like trying to make him run before he can walk. The fact that this method of teaching reading has been used in the Arab countries for many centuries does not make it the right one, or even a successful one : educationally it is quite absurd. There are published, in all languages, scientifically-designed and properly-graded reading-books for children, and if we are to have progress at the proper rate in the schools of Bahrain it is essential that such books should be used. I recommend that your Highness should abso lutely forbid the use of the Qur'an as a method of teaching children to read, and should order that proper reading-books be used. If this is done, it will be found that the children will derive more benefit in one hour from a scientifically-designed reader than they could obtain in a week from a book which was designed for reading by adults.48 As to the Teaching of Handwriting. The Arabic handwriting of nearly all the boys was very beautifully done, and was, indeed, one of the most pleasing features of the Bahrain schools, especially in these days, when it is considered by students in some of the Arab countries that to write badly is a sign of cleverness and superior education. No complaint can be made about the Arabic handwriting in the schools of Bahrain: the English handwriting', however, was very bad indeed, and this is unfortunate, because bad handwriting in the young is considered by English people to be a sure sign of poor education, and this may make it difficult for Bahrain boys to obtain posts with English or American business companies, or in banks. The English handwriting at the schools is bad because it is learned in a curious way. It seems that the boys of Bahrain learn to write English by copying what is written by their masters on the blackboard, and since no two masters have the same handwriting, the results are disastrous. Proper copy-books, which had apparently never been heard of in the schools, are essential if English handwriting is to be properly mastered. I suggest that your Highness should ask the Education Department to see that these are ordered, and that they are regularly used in all the classes where English is taught. The best copy-books, for use in Bahrain, would be those of the ' Vere Foster Series,' in the ' Medium ' style of writing. Books 1—10. Copy-book writing, very frequently for the juniors and less frequently for the seniors, should be done in all the English classes, and not in the junior classes only.49 Now about Arithmetic. The standard of Arithmetic at all the Bahrain schools is very low—it is probably the weakest subject of all. Serious steps will have to be taken to improve the teaching of this subject in the near future, if Bahrain boys are going to be considered by employers of labour to be worth employing. I was shown by the headmasters of the Manamah and Muharraq schools a number of question-papers in Mathematics which they told me had been set to their pupils at the end of the year. The questions were of a high standard, and although I was not shown any of the answers I was assured that the boys were well able to cope with them : but these assurances do not at all agree with what I was told by people who have bad actual experience of Bahrain schoolboys as employees. The Employment Officer of the Bahrain Oil Company and the Manager of the Eastern Bank both told me that, much as they would like to do so, it is almost impossible to offer Bahrain schoolboys any of the better posts—in the case of the Bank, any post at all—owing to their invariable inability to carry out accurately the simplest mathematical calculations. I am satis fied that these statements are correct, for such complaints are not confined to Bahrain, but are made by European employers of labour all over the Middle East. In Persia, for example, the standard of education—especially mathematical education-is so low that oil companies there have been ob liged to establish their own schools, in order to ensure that their youthful employees thall be properly educated ; and in one of the neighbouring Arab states, where large sums of money are spent on education, it is rare to find a post-office official who can give one his correct change without first making a laborious calculation with pencil and paper. The reason why the standard of mathematical ability in the Middle East is so low, while it is so high in India, is that in the Middle East boys are taught to learn by heart and to imitate, but never to think for themselves. The Arab student can solve quite successfully the mathematical problems which he finds in his school text-book, because all those problems follow closely some regular model which he has learned by heart how to solve. But confront him with a mathematical problem from real life—one which does not take ex actly the same form as those given in his school Arithmetic book—and he is hopelessly lost, and unable even to attempt it. We shall see no improvement in the standard of mathematics in the Bahrain schools until we alter our methods of teaching and train boys to think, rather than to learn by heart and to imitate. This question of the mathematical teaching is one to which the new controller will have to give his early and earnest attention, if we are to be able to satisfy employers of labour that our boys are worth appointing to any of the better posts. He may find it necessary to advise the Education Depart ment to engage abler teachers of this subject. If this is done, it misht be a good plan to look to India for teachers of mathematics, rather than to any of the Arab countries. I suggest that your Highness should instruct the new controller to prepare a special report for the Education Department on the question of the teaching of mathematics.10 b 50 The Teaching of Arabic. I was sorry to find nearly all the masters at the schools pressing for an increase in the teaching of English, at the expense of the teaching of Arabic. This is an utterly wrong and utterly mistaken idea. Everywhere I went, I heard the same demand for more English, and I was surprised to find that even the youngest babies in the infants' classes were being taught the English letters, alongside the Arabic letters. Many reasons were given to me in support of this demand. Some of them were as follows : ' English is the international language of the world.'—'English is the language of commerce.'—'English is the official language of Bahrain.'—' Bahrain is becoming a cosmopolitan state, and most of the foreigners who come here know English : we cannot communicate with them unless we know English too.'- ' Ninety per cent of the schools' past students are earning their living through their knowledge of English.'—' We cannot obtain the good posts in the Oil Company unless we know English.' All the above statements may be trne, and it is also true that while there are 200,000,000 people who speak the EngliBh tongue, only about one- fifth of this number speak some form of Arabic. Nevertheless, it is utterly wrong that the same importance should be given in the Bahrain schools to English as to Arabic. In the first place, a student's first linguistic duty is to his own native tongue. No Arab can consider himself an educated or a cultured person until he can speak and write Arabic fluently and correctly. Secondly, the function of a school is to impart true education, and not to provide its pupils with jobs. Finally, it is not possible for any Arab to learn English well until he knows Arabic well, and he cannot know Arabic well without a long and painstaking study of Arabic grammar and composition. Show me a student who is good at Arabic, and I will show you one who will later be good at English. In my opinion, it is much to be regretted that in some of the Arab countries the study of Arabic is becoming more and more neglected. In these countries the education authorities think it better to provide their students with a miscellaneous fund of almost valueless facts, taken from semi- scientific American summaries, rather than to equip them with a sound know ledge of their own noble language. One of the curious results of this policy is that in the great universities of Europe, where there are Schools of Oriental Languages, it is nearly always the Arabs who fail in the Arabic papers, and the Europeans who pass. Surely this is a shameful state of affairs, when a great language is not properly known by its own people. Let us not make the same mistake in Bahrain, or listen to those who ask that greater importance shall be given in the schools to a foreign language than to the native tongue. I am not in any way opposed to the teaching, in the Bahrain schools, of English to a high standard ; but it is absolutely essential, if success in English is to be expected, that the first place, and the most time, should be given to the study of Arabic. The teaching of the English letters to the babies can do no harm, and it could be allowed to continue : but they should on no accouut be allowed to go beyond that in English, or to learn any English at all until they arrive at the Second Stage. I recommend that your Highness should issue firm instructions that Arabic is to be regarded as being of first importance as a subject of study in the schools of Bahrain.I mm</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00015a_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/1/373</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00015a</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/1/373</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 19/248 I (C 78) Education at Bahrain'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1939/1940</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2013-11-26T11:06:31</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 volume (245 folios)</extent><extent>File is arranged in chronological order, from earliest at beginning of the file to most recent at end.Index numbers corresponding with the index at the back run through the volume; these numbers are written using red crayon and are circled.</extent><extent>A bound correspondence volume.
