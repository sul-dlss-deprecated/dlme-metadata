Concrete and sana-bag protection of the main wells ha£e been completed, motor bicycles have arrived and the police are being trained to ride them, search-lights for the Refinery Perimeter are due to-day (5th December), explosives have been removed to Jidda Island, and already experience has shown where tne original plan can be modified in orcer to save personnel and material. hitherto in the absence of specific instructions or^any special Defence Officer we have nad to run this dex^nce business through a sort of triumvirate consist ing of the Political Agent, the Adviser and the Chief Docal representative of the Bahrain Petroleum Company, ihis foorks well enough but is obviously an inefficient way ox doing things. The Company are eager to see the whole scheme of protection put in charge of the special lexnee Ollicer (presumably to be Hr. Ranee) and with their point of view I entirely agree. I acknowledge that the Defence Officer is not solely for Bahrain but also is, avS the Air Officer Commanding puts it, 'to co-orainate defence schemes' elsewhere, but the fact remains that _.ost of his time will be spent in Bahrain because Bahrain nas the greatest number oi Luropeans (and Americans ?) wno can be accepted in a local Volunteer Defence Force. While the organisation and care of that Volunteer Force will be his main task, I see no good reason why he should not at the same timebe C*0* of the joint forces used for the protection of the Oil Company^ premises. Though I no longer contemplate that members of the Volunteer Defence should take an active part in Field and Refinery Defence, i*e. in its day-to-day anti-sabotage disposi tions, nevertheless the organisation of tne force and the organisation of anti-sabotage protection are features of a single plan for the protection of Bahrain and of its one vittlLiy important industry. I would suggest that steps be taken at once to have this pro position clearly recognised. 3. At present the personnel employed on the Field and Refinery Defence is found from police and naturs provided by the Bahrain Government and a limited number of British employees of the Oil Company. These British employees nave been taken off their normal tasks and allocated for whole time duty on defence. I cannot say that all of them are the best possible men for the task and none of them of coure has had * vious training to fit them for it. The Company have now suggested that British personnel should be recruit ed specially for this task. From enquiries which they have made in Lngland they are satisfied that men can be so enlisted through organisations such as the of Frontiersmen. They suggest that such men snouid be recruited either by the Agency or by the Bahrain Government thougn the Company will meet all expenses, travil^ing, pay, accommodation, food and so on. Their argument is that if the men are recruit ed by us or the Bahrain Government they are likely to be more amenable to discipline in performing duties under the orders of the Defence Officer; and for this argument /-argument tnere is a gooa deal to oe said. On the whole I would recommend that the proposal should be accepted, on condition, of course, tnat the whole agreement is reduced to writing. 4. I come now to the contribution in personnel made by the Bahrain Government. Experience has shown that the Bahrain police are baa. They have never before had to perform regular duties under semi-service conditions; their N.C.Os are for the most part pitiful; their dis cipline is poor and in fact they cannot function when removed from the personal care of the Adviser* The above is a rather sweeping condemnation of the whole «» police Force and I readily admit tnat there are exceptions both among fl.C.Os and the men, but the trouble is that these are exceptions. One result of being called on to perform regular duties nas been a great number of requests for discharge from men wno have completed four years’ service and are unwilling to re-eniist* At the same time good men are not coming forward as recruits as nobody likes the routine of defence. I have proposed separately that we should arrange to loan Mr. Hallows to the State for two months to endeavour to work out e re-organisation scheme for the police; and I think, we should now contem plate advising the state very definitely to separate their normal standing police requirements'from their speical war-rtime needs. In other words I consider that Bahrain would be well advised to enlist specially about 50 Baiucnis as a 'war force r to be employed solely on protect ive duties. This would eliminate a great many difficulties, particularly the complication that would arise as a result of different standards of discipline likely to be exacted by Mr. Ranee as Defence Officer and Mr. 'elgrave as Commandant of the State Police. The special force could oe solely/--i 4&lt; solely i^nd wholely under the disciplinary control of the lei'cncc Oxiicur. I an av.are that the Bahrain Government do not liice Balucriis and tentative su^iestions nu 3 &lt;io 30 far to the above effect have produced no result; but I consider that we shoulu be well advised now to insist on it and if you agree I should like if possible to get this matter settled while you are in Bahrain. 5th December IGob.(imERAL TT73TRTTCTICKS C5) A Tha organization is set up solely for the purpose of reducing the niniiaum possibilities of sabotage and for creating a state of alertness throughout the whole concession area and avoid delay in operations arising from any interference or fire hazards during the present war.

There are certain points in our conversation yes terday about Field Defence on which I think I should write to you. In the first place although in the initial stages of our defence arrangements there were only 19 wells f, desig- nated M for visits by the patrol cars^ I understood from you yesterday that there are now 65 on the list. This seems to indicate a considerable change of policy on the part of the Company and the reason for it is not altogether apparent to me. I may be wrong but I do not think tdat there are 65 producing wells in the whole Field and I cannot quite see the object of visiting non-producers. 2. If the Company feol it is essential that patrols should now visit a greater number of wells I v/ould suggest that it is at least desirable to draw a distinction between those wells which are valuable producers and whose d istruc- tion might cause serious interference with the Company’s output and might also damage the Field in general, and those other wells which owing to their low pressure or flow are not of the same importance and could, if sabotaged, be brought under control with reasonable ease. (Would it not be correct to say that the former category lie towards the centre of the Field while the latter are more on the cir cumference ?) The former category could then be subjected to intensive patrolling and the latter receive only the amount of attention which their value really warrants. J.S.Black, Ksq., 3. Though/- Chief Local Representative, Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited, Bahrain.Though it is true that tests have been /nade to ascertain how long concrete protection would delay saboteurs an*-; no/, long i$ would take a gang of men to remove sand bags y i am not sure that the resulting ’’delay period” ascertained is really a true indication. I understand that the curb of the well which was opened up was not reinforced and that had there been reinforcement the task of removing the con crete slab would have been very much more difficult, similarly i imagine that the well from which the sand bags were removed was one in which the mrster-valve was somewhat close to the surface. It seems evident that the delay inter val depends very much on the depth from the surface at which the master-valve is located and it is possible that there are several wells where this is so deep down that a party of sa boteurs would not reach it for days. I suggested to you yesterday that information should be obtained as to the actual depth oi the master-valve in each well so that a clearer es timate can be obtained of the ’’delay period” in each particular case. I believe that this information may greatly affect the final decision about the frequency of visits to each well of either category and consequently the routeing of the visiting patrols. i 4. I suggest that information on the above lines should be collated by the Production Depart, ent as soon as possible and that Ranee and perhaps Bush should then have a preliminary discussion about future arrangements for Field protection: after which we can take a final decision.

Deputy Secretaryl-LCUE'I D.O. No. C/7‘J0-l.a/4S Dated the ICth October 1940. n As I nave mentioned to you in a yrivito letter, L-ajor Rose, tf.S.O. IX, -ir Mead .u; rteis, Mabbaniyeh, visited Bahrain towards the end of last week. I had made i yti-sonal request to hii: to come before. I left as I v;r $ far from satisfied with the way things v.r re ^oing in re^-rd to Bahrain Defence generally. As you arc a*.are there has been considerable.’ trouble with the so- called 'Refinery Guards' ^ho had been recruited by the Company / ^/o3 Z as lorecest in my telegram No. ^2 dated the 15th January 1940. These men, v.-ho cere bound only by the terms of their civil contract, knew that they were not under military discipline under Major Byurct and being very much of the 'old soldier' type ~pent vouch of tneir energies in playing err the Company anu Byard. The great delay tin t occurred in securing the appointment of a Defence Officer hue the inevit* hie effect on &amp;ii-round co-operation; the delay in obtaining the Iraqi Bevy Officer oi course set back the training of the Special Police; and generally specking the fnti-sabotage defence plan was not working at more than 10^ efficiency. 2. As a result of Rose’s visit he? has accepted the view \ held very strongly not only by myself but by ^yard and the Company tnat tne Company’s own 'Refinery Guards' must be replaced by men enlisted as members of His Majesty’s Forces. They must come under proper discipline and must be under unitary control. In this connection you may like to consult the following correspondence — Air Ministry telegram No. 683 dated the 13th January 1940; your telegram No. 45 dated the /- The Hon’ble hieut-Colonel C. G. Prior, C. X. I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.- 2 - L the 15th January .nd Ey telegram iio. u&lt; ted tha 16th January. V ;e hatpin effect tried out a plan which we knew would not work but had to adopt in the absence of anything better; f.nc experience nes only proved our belief. Hose will re-oeon the question as from the Air Officer Commanding to the Air Ministry, (for after all they are now responsible), and I have asked him to make it plain that if the Air Ministry turn down the proposal we night gust as well abandon all pretence at a really effective rorm of- protection. The Company have given us in writing an undertaking to pry for 10 men at a rate of £ 25/” p.m., to transport them, f ed and house them sne to repatriate them at the end of the v.-ar. Actually only 3 men will he required; and the balance of the funds which the Company undertake to pay will prohabi; be used for otner purposes. I did not telegraph to you since jour views were plain from the correspondence quoted above. 2. Before Bose came I had asked Byard to let me know definitely the total number of Special Police that he would require. At the moment he has his dispose! 50 Special Police plus 5a iiaturs and again experience has shown that the local personnel put into the defence pool by the Bahrain uovernment must belong to a single unit and ce under uniu^rj discipline. Byard had given me the figure 116 which was -o include a small reserve for sickness, leave and training and I had already written to Belgrave asking him to appro\e ol number and to issue the necessary instructions tjhaiith Khalifah to recruit the balance of Special Police required, either from the foaturs or otherwise. Hose however was of the opinion, and I could not combat it , that the men were being asked to do too much night work and must have longer periods of leisure. This involves an increase in their numbers and Byard /-Byard is at the moment engaged in working out revised figures. I have little doubt that the Bahrain Government rill, however reluctantly, put in the. extra men since their stake is the Oil Field, which represents capital amounting possibly to as much as one hundred million rupees# 4. There were various other minor problems to clean up, such as transport for patrol work, ani these were fully dealt with. b. The object I have been aiming at is for the Political /.sent to stay in the picture only as an adviser and as a greaser of wheels, though it is difficult not to get dragged in a good aeal more. It is of course arguable tnat it is a waste of time and effort to go anything for. the protection of the Field and definery though I cannot bring myself to this point of view particularly in vie?- of possible deve lopments in Egypt and the Ifiddle Bast generally. On the other hand it must be recognised that without unitary control and discipline the scheme will not vork and I h ve b.^-n trying to ensure so f'r as I can that ail personnel employed is pro perly organised and disciplined. 6. There is a more rosy side to the picture. The Iraqi Levy Officer is excellent and the Special Police under him are beginning to come into shape very nicely. There is, of course, r long-term obyecyive here. 7. We discuspea •iso the Local Volunteer Terence Force, enrolment to which has teen very slow. Our local Britishers in the Oil Company are an argumentative crowd and have thought out an amazing number of reasons for not joining the Volunteer Force, which last week stood at 5r. I had arranged a meeting of a dozen of the better men in order to get them to encourage tneir associates and fellow shift-workers to join. This meeting/-mooting took place actually while Rose was here- It se&lt; nied to be a success and the 12 representatives assured me that as a result of certain explanations and exhortations which I made they would be able to bring in 2 3 L*e--1 many more- I think too that the cooler rcather will serve to encourage enrolment• 3. 7 t felt that th;re should be an Indian ' T ing to the Volunteer Defence Force; indeed I nave thought this for some considerable time tut it depends on the billty of *!r Head quarters to ‘ educe the i.rmy in India to send an ad itional instructor- Rose will do his best in t is respect on nis arrival back at dabbaniyah.

H.B.M’s Political Resident, BAHRAIN, Persian Gulf. Dear Sir, From the Company’s standpoint the need for local defence has been considered in four groups. 1, (a) Pro-enemy propaganda by employees vhile on duty. (b) Sabotage by employees while on duty. 2. (a) Pro-enemy propaganda by employees off duty. (b) Sabotage by employees, ex-employees and others. 3 # (a) Local risings which might entail at acks on the Com any’s property. (b) Sneray landing parties, arriving by air or sea. 4. Bombardment from sea or air. 1 (a) and 2 (a) Pro-enemy propaganda It is believed that all our disaffected personnel have been discovered and discharged as occasion warranted. 1 (b) Internal sabotage. The Company maintains a considerable force of naturs who guard the gates and constantly tour the Company’s fenced- in areas. In the Refinery areas and in the shops and stores this is supplemented by the constant presence of white men who work in these places. It is believed that the effect of any sabotage would be very slight as the saboteur would be apprehended before he could do much damage. 2 (b) Sabotage by persons who shoul d not be on the the Company’s premises. The details of this defence scheme are in Major Byard’s Plan. Very briefly, this Plan calls for a foice of white and native guards whose duty it is to watch all the Company's areas outside the wired enclosures. Variations of this plan have been in practice since the outbreak of war but all have caused an enormous amount of troublen» i CON-658 - 2 - 25th October. 1940. It is agreed that such a plan will only be efficient^ if the v/hite guards are enlisted men and the native guards avail able in sufficient numbers. It goes without saying that the officer in charge of this groups should be efficient. liajor Rose, from Air H.Q., visited Bahrein recently and had same suggestions to make about this plan. /«/i In an endeavour to meet these the Company made certain offers which were sent to the Political Agent on Octpbcr 13th under cover of letter CON-650. — /&gt; ?( t &lt; These offers presumed that enlisted men will be used as | white guards and that the whole plan will have the approval of A ir H. .. So far, it is not known whether enlisted men mill be used for this purpose. This point ought to be cleared up as soon as possible. The present position is not satisfactory, especially as the white guards now on duty do not work well with Major Byard. If it is decided that enlisted men shall not be used here the Company will probably contend that no useful purpose will be served by continuing an unsatisfactory scheme, and will discharge its white guards. No new men will be hired to replace them. 3 (a) Local Risings &amp; (b) Enemy landing parties. To repel these, or to engage them until reinforcements of regular troups arrive, all the forces in Bahrein will pre sumably be used - Belgrave’s Police, Byard’s Guards and the Volunteer Defence Force. Of the latter force about 90$ are Company employees. Major Byard is the Conilanding Officer. The Company has no direct interest in the Force but it does provide free quarters and messing for the Sergeant Instructor. In an emergency of short duration the Company could not object if all its British employees were used against the enemy, but for reasons given in a letter to Major Byard (CON-656 of Oct. 23rd) it cannot willingly allow its employees to be used regularly or permanently for ordinary defence purpose. 4. Bombardment from sea or air. It cannot be admitted that it is the duty of the Company or its employees to provide active defence against such attacks. The company 1 s duty seems to end when it has provided passive defence, such as shelters and a black-out, and civilian measures such as fire fighters and a casualty clearance service. If the authorities consider it necessary to supply active defence against air attack they should be completely res ponsible for it and its personnel. )?VCON-6 58 25th October. 1940 - 3 The company will co-operate as much as it can in the matter of landing armaments and building emplacements and so on. Further, the Company will if necessary provide shelters of some sort for gun crews at each gun site, ^ and rill put a of quarters, together with kitchens and bathing facilities, for the relief gunners at the disposal of the authorities. The quarters most likely to be suitable are of concrete, brand new, and on the Rafa hill behind the Refinery. Their draw back is their proximity to the native quarters. It is recognised that early warning of the approach of enemy aircraft is one of the essentials of successful defence. The Company have taken certain steps in this matter. All the CASOC outstations are equipped with wireless sets and if aircraft are heard in any of these areas a wireless message will be sent to their headquarters, whence a wireless alarm will be transmitted to ^-wali. This is a 24-hour service. We consider advance notice from this source as one of the most essential features for protec tion of our families as well as our Refinery Operators, in the event planes are in the vicinity. Since the last raid the Company has maintained a night watch for aircraft, and the Company v/ill try to continue this as long as men are available. In order to avoid misunderstandings such as have arisen in the past, this is not to be construed as willingness to equip and man listening posts all over the place. Major Byard is Defence Officer for the Gulf and draws his authority from Air H.Q. Iraq. H e is concerned in the anti sabotage plan, the Volunteer Defence Force and, presumably, the air defence scheme. It must be difficult for him to draw a line between these activities but the Company*s obligations in each is so different that frequent misunderstandings have arisen between him and the Company. His keenness is not in question and he is excellent with his native guards, but he has the unhappy knack of failing to get co-operation from white people, whether they are guards or Company Department Heads. The idea that he will be in charge of anti-aircraft defence does not inspire confidence. Outstanding unanswered questions are:- To what extent, if any, should the Volunteer Defence Force be used for routine guard duties, manning gun posts, etc? wm enlisted men be available to serve as guards in the anti-sabotage scheme? If so, how soon will they arrive here? If not, is it worth while continuing with the scheme at all? *(L“ , r.&gt;&gt; t&gt; 2&gt; 3. 4.GM 6 . 7. 8 . 9, 10 . 11 . 12 . 13. 14. 15. If the amti-sabotage scheme continues will it be independent of any plan for anti-aircraft defence? Yfill crews and reliefs be supplied for the A.A. guns? Will they be white or native? Under whose command? Till the Company be asked to do more for them than is already offered? i.e. transportation, medical services, recreational facilities. If searchlights and other A.A. equipment are sent will the Company be asked to do for their personnel what it is doing for the gun crews? Where does responsibility for the defence of Bahrein really lie? T '1iat should be the relationship, for defence purposes and as far as the Company is concerned, between the P.A. , the S.K.O., the A.L.O., the De fenc e Officer and the Company? It has been stated that His Majesty^ Government is more concerned with the safety of the oil field than the safety of the Refinery. Is this authentic? To whom should information likely to be of use to Intelligence be given; the P.A. or the A.L.O.? In the past there have been instances of lack of co-operation between these persons in the matter of 'information received**. will the holders of various offices under H.y.G. and the Forces abate their idea that the Company is a sort of rich godmother who will foot the bill for all their pet schemes?No - C/387 of 1940.

I appreciate that enemy plan may be to cause diversion of forces but some air defence measures are essential as there is uneasiness among local population and grave risk of precipitating evacuation of American oil personnel with consequent loss of production. 3.

Six men per gun are apparently required end each gun should have a relief cre\.# In other woras 3C men are required of whom only six ccn be provided by the Navy# These men will obviously have to remain at their posts throughout the day and night and to expect the Company to give their highly ^uid and trained staff for this purpose is, in my view, most unreasonable# The Company’s st.ff has been depleted to some extent by the exodus of Americans (some ten are expected to leave it) and as a large number of 1 nr rleans are leaving the Oil Company •'t Dhar&amp;n they will no longer be able to call on reserves from the California Ar hi an bh ncn.rd Oil Company# It is probable therefore that shortly :he Bahrain Petroleum Company will be running with the minimum of personnel and without reserves# b* paragraph 5 of the Military Appreciation of the Defence of Bahrain states that the question of air attack or of attack by sea need not be considered and that the Appreciation deals only with a possible tribal attack and sabotage# It was there fore to ccul with these that tho Volunteer Defence Force was established ana it w s not intended that the Defence Force of part of it should remain permanently mobilised, m 4. It is therefore, in my opinion, entirely up to the Air Officer Comaionding, Iraq, to provide permanent and trained personnel for these guns.2 - 5 * As regards (fc&gt;) it is first to be decided whether the V.B. guns are to be retained in position after trie H*A. suns have been mounted# This is a decision for the lei'ence Officer and Air Officer Commanding to make but it seems clear that there is the possibility of these guns being attacked during an air raid by low-flying aircraft ana that therefore the V.B. guns will also be required co os permanently maimed. d. The Chief bocal liepresentetive, the Bahrain Petroleum Company, is coming down this aiming to discuss tnese points with the political Resident and &lt;after this I suggest a discussion T.'itn the benlor Naval Officer. The latter informed me yesterday in course of conversation that the Commander-in-Chief hao asked Army Headquarters, Indxa, for gunners but nad been tola that they V\oulo not be available. (I do not understand why this should nave emanated irom the Commander-in-Chief and not from the .*ir OXiicer commanding, Iraq, who is responsible for the Defence of the oulf against air attack). , 7* A further point is that tne management of the Company seem at the moment to be inclined to be panicky and continuous and unreasonable demands on their personnel will not in any way help in reducing this inclination. 24/10/40 P.

Then other preoccupations allow, on general issue we are inclined to recommend that political back ground, against which defence needs have to be viewed, should be filled in by visit of Prior to Cairo, possibly reinforced by officer from this department. 3. Defence of Bahrain. Apart from American oil interests and British prestige in Gulf our treaty obliga tions probable reactions of Moslem opinion particularly at time of pilgrimage and Iranian claim to Bahrain suggest urgent need for practical reassurance by measures on lines advocated by Prior.

To The Chief Local Representative, The Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited, Bahrain Dear Sir, Will you kindly refer to your letter Tto. CON-658 dated the 25th October 1940, a copy of which was sent to me, regarding local defence ? The matters mentioned therein were dealt with at the meeting held on the 26th October, but it may be convenient to the Company to have some record of the discussions and this is given in the form of replies to the questions raised in your letter. 2. The Honourable the Political Resident desires me to say that (l) the employment oi the Local Defence Force is governed by the terms of their recruitment which provide that they may be called upon to perform military service in the event (a) of a local civil disturbance of such a nature as cannot be dealt with by local Civil Forces (b) an attempted landing or invasion by hostile forces. If, however, in the present crisis it is possible for them to give any help without impeding the operations of the Company it would be welcome. (jc) This is very doubolulj in fact, owing to legal and other diificulties it is most unlikely that such men will be forthcoming.(3) See reply to (2) above* (4) It was decided at the meeting that the best plan would be to dismiss the existing guards and endeavour to obtain European police ser ;eants from India. The Air Officer Commanding has agreed to this and an application is now being made to the Government of India. (5) Yes. (6) It is hoped so. (7) It is not possible to say. (8) It is hoped that they will have their own officer, but as Defence personnel they will be under the general control of the Defence Officer. (9) It is hoped not. (10) It is not possible to answer this question in advance. (11) The Air Officer Commanding, Iraq. (12) The Deience Officer is in charge, but refers matters of policy to the Political Agent. The Senior Naval Officer and the Air Liaison Officer are only indirectly concerned. (13) No. (14) This was not discussed at the meeting, if the point is explained verbally, it can no doubt be cleared up. (15) The Honourable the Political Resident would not normally receive a letter couched in these terms. The Company have, however, afforded many facilities, for which we are grateful and it is hoped to reduce further demands to a minimum. 3. The Senior Naval Officer has suggested that the question of protection from shell splinters should be taken up by the Company, it is understood that this is under consideration.

My letter of 8/11 leaving here today fully explains situation. Local Defence Volunteers are intended to be used for defence against air attack as well as ground attack. Unlikely these will be simultaneous. Personnel to man searchlight must be found from local resources. Searchlight is of little use during periods of bright moonlight and at other times consider it suffi cient if crew sleep near light, instruct Defence Officer Persian Gulf to arrange in consultation with S.N.O.P.G.

The Air Liaison Officer Manama, Bahrein Dear Sir I have consulted the Management about the tonics you raised during our conversation yesterday. The Management’s opinion about leuting Company employees form gun and searchlight crews has already been expressed in memoranda and letters and at the Political Resident’s meeting. The Management feel that they should take no further steps in the matter until they are accurately informed about the extent and duration of your need. If you can give them this information they would be in a position to make such arrangements and dispositions as lie in their power; but I must stress that any assistance in manpower that they do or will offer is temporary and raay have to be frequently adjusted to meet the Company's own requirements. However, because offensive equioment is already available, but men to use them are not, the Management has re-arranged its defence and fire fighting programme so as to free some men for your use during an air raid. The following men will not be needed by the Company at the beginning of a raid, but the/ may be needed as soon as a raid is over. If you can arrange v/ith these men to volunteer for duty on guns or lights and can transport them to the sites, the Company will not call for their services untilthe raiders have passed. Messrs. Cornell, Cole, Gray, Tommey, Thompson, W.R.Walker, T.G.Brown, Pyrah, Garlick, Sinclair, Clifford, Simoson, E. Turner. The following are on night telephone duty but on any night five at least will be available for you in i the same way as above. Messrs. Wild de Carteret J. Wright Mouatt Marsh McGregor Sutton-Wright Barry I desire to make it clear that all the men you use are only to be M on call ' and are not to be asked to do regular duty or to sleep elsewhere than in Awali.

I agree as to importance of political considerations relevant to Persian Gulf Area being adequately appreciated by Middle East and that at some future suitable opportunity it may be useful to pursue your suggestion of a personal visit by the Political Resident (the present is hardly a suitable time for such visit in view of other weighty preoccupations of G.o.C. in Chief.) The recent personal contacts which Prior has had with A.O.C. ana S.N.O. should I hope be of consideraibe advantage generally, as well as in respect of Bahrain. I note from Political Resident’s teiegram of November 1st No.T/516 that certain concrete proposals have emerged from tneir discussions and I trust these will result in improvement in position in Bahrain. Your proposal to depute Chief in spector of Explosives to work out scheme for passive defence should also be useful. We have urged on Air Ministry the importance of ooang whatever is possible to strengthen local defences, and they are asking A.O.C. to report.

Also the smaller islands of i UHARRAQ»SITRA,UMMNAASA,and NUBI- SALEH.For the purpose of this appreciation only the islands of BAHREIN f aiUHARRAQ and SITKA are considered, BAHREIN island is mostly flat and low.The native population of the island * is approximately 120,000, of whom about three quarters are Shia Mahommedans and mainly agricultural.The remainder including the ruling family are Sunnis. The chief town is MAN/UAH,at the North Eas— tern corner of the island,with a population of 25,000# Immediately oppsite UAHAMAH is the town of /UHARRAQ on the island of OTHARAQ# A Causeway along which runs a road stretches out to connect these town ; and islands ,but there is at present a gap of 130 yards in the causeway which has to be crobissed by boat. It is anticipated that by about the end of 1939,this gap will be reduced ir width and will be spanned by a swing bridge. 2. BAHREIN is ruled by a Shaikh who isAjtreaty re lations with the Britsh Government .In brief the Shaikh agrees to alienate no part of his territory except to the British ,to conform to British policy and to accept no help pecuniary or otherwise from any foreign power# The Shaikh has a Brittish Advisor and there is a British Political Agent • Air Headquarters,British Forces in 'Iraq also have an Air Liaison Officer in MANAMAH# 3# BAHREIN has always been of great importance to Great Britain in view of its controlling position in the Persian Gulf • In recent years the finding of oil,the formation of an oil company ( The BAHREIN Petroleum CompanyLtd) and the erection of a refinery has greatly increased this importance# Moreover in view of possible trouble in the Anglo Iranian Oil Fields in the ev.nt of war, the oil fiels of BAHREIN and Arabian Coast might become of vital importance in the maintenance of the Empire oil fuel supplies# 4# The main reasons why the defence of BAHREIN must be undertaken are:- (a) The valuable oil fields and Refinery. (b) The existence of the Jafair naval shore establi shments. (c) Its importance as a landing ground and alighting^t 4 W^^. 0 U the main Empire air route. (d) The fact that it has been decided to station a R.A.F. flight on the island of MUHARRAQ. (e) The fact that it has been selected aa the future location of the Persian Gulf Residency. (f) The partial guarantee of protection given by the British Government. 5# It has been ruled that the question of air attack or attack by sea need not be considered and this appre ciation only deals with possible tribal attack and sabotage.7. The Shaikh of BAHREIN and the bulk of the population are pro-British and contented • In HANAMAH and MUHAKRAQ towns there are large Indian and Persian communities and a number of foreign Arabs. Some of these are in touch with foreign Political organisations. In an emergency attempts might be made to organise raids or to carry out extensive sabotage at the oil fields and vital points ; or at any time attempts might be made'Jstir up labour troubles # particularly among the Oil Company*8 employees • It is extremely unlikely that the natives in the interior of the island could be worked up to carry out any tribal raids • The problem therefore is entirly one of internal security.PrtMPt w«r«t Th# rolltleal Agant Tha Advlaar to tha Bahrain Ctovaraiaant ilia Dafanca offlcar Tha Air Llalaon Officer end Captain homae who has come down from Iraq to aaalat in tha praparatlon of dafanca plan* tha diacuaaion h^gan with tha different eventnalitlea ^hlch alight heve to be guarded a alnat* Tha moat likely of Uiaaa w#ra conalderacl to he t (a) Sabotage* either by internal or by external aganta or by both combined.

It seemed possible that enemy agents had on some occasions in the past been able to obtain information of happenings in Bahrain and that they could still do so without being detected. Something more comprehensive in the way of intelligence service seem to be required. The Adviser has ^course 4§ the best means of obtaining information. The Air Liaison Officer also has some agents. It seems to me take that the Agency requires an officer who can toot* on intelli gence work and organise some system whereby he can obtain intelligence from all strata of the population. The person who might do this is perhaps the Publicity Officer if he can spare the time and he should also be provided with sufficient funds to carry on the work. If this were done he would be able to organise an efficient network extending to adjacent territories and possibly to other parts of the Persian Gulf. The Air Liaison OCficer is quite right when he says that more information is needed and it seems to me that the only satis factory solution is the above which is indeed the general practice elsewhere where in each area you have one officer responsible for intelligence work. 5th December 1940,BRITISH OVERSEAS AIRWAYS CC^RPORATION.

Captain THOMAS is to remain at BAHREIN until the Scheme is completed. After agreement by the 1VA. and the General Manager of the Oil Coy., the Scheme is to be submitted to A.H.Q. tor final approval. ^ Mr. LIPP said that whilst the details of the Defence Theme were bei.g worked out, Mr. McCONNEL would be r vailable for ^ing d^ect advice in matters concerning the protection of the lilnelds area, and Mr. ANDRES SON for the Refinery area.

The Oil Coy. should oe cskod to give what assistance they can. Covering authority for any expenses involved will be given later by ii.Ii.Q. Additional Indian troops from ADEN have been asked for to man this s-earen- livht.

Hao.. post is to have a fixed mounting, and is to be protected by sandbag walls. Posts are to be manned by personnel working in the refinery. Such personnel will be limited as the majority of British and American personnel are engaged on 'key 1 * duties, 'personnel for this duty need not necesarily be members of the Volunteer Porce. The Light Machine Guns and ammunition required are to be retained permanently at the refinery. The D.O. is to work out some system whereby they can be adequately safeguarded and at the same time be ready for use at short notice. Owing to the nature of their duties it will not be possible for men working in the refinery to man these guns until after warning has been received. In addition 5 or 6 similar posts (making 9 in all) are to be constructed outside the refinery. These latter posts are to be manned by Volunteers from AV/ALI Gamp, in the event of sufficient warning being obtained. At present, the Light Machine Guns available for A.A. defence at the refinery are borrowed temporarily from the BAHREIN Government. INDIA have been asked to provide nine Light Machine Guns (Vickers Berthier) for issue to the Voiui eors. These guns have not yet arrived owing to the units in IITDI . receiving preference. Major Rose said he would find ou' on return, if 4 Lewis Guns and connected equipment v/ere ava' In at HABBANIYA for issue to the D.O. as a temporary measure. s ^ .'.0 is requested to investigate this possibility). 16. Air Raid Warning System. - The D.O. is to ensure miau i adequate system of Air Raid warnings exists for the refinery ree Details are to be included in the Defence Scheme. 17. Natoors* Camp. - The temporary camp occupied by the Natoors in the vicinity of the perimeter fence is to be evacuated, and the Natoors moved to the native camp about half a mile away* DEFENCE OF OILFIELDS AREA. 18. 3.A.3.0. pointed out, and Mr, LIPP agreed, that, in the case of the Oilfields area, it was impossible to ensure 100% security. A large area is involved which contains some 60 well heads, and to provide complete protection against sabotage wouldnrsquire a large body of trained troops, which are not available. What is wanted is the maximum possible security consistent with the resources available. Present local re sources are limited to the Special Defence Police Force. as the number of Police and Natoors available is comparatively small it is all the more important that they should be well trained, and used to the best possible advantage. 19. By Day. Oil personnel are constantly moving over ti- area by day, and one lookout post is considered sufficient to give warning of any unusual occurrence. The best site for this post appears to be on the hill near the water tower. The man an duty should have a telephone with which to communicate with AV/ALI CAMP. The D.O. is to work out the number of reliefs required. Probably two men will be sufficient, one man being on duty at a time. 20. By Night. The best means of protection is by means of active patrolling. The oilfields area can be divided into 3 sub-areas, A, B and C, each sub-area containing about 20 wells. A further sub-division of these areas is undesirable as this would require more men for patrolling than are available. (Continued/ Each area5 \\ /This man could be Para. 20 (Cont/d.). Each area should have one patrol working in it throughout the entire night. Each patrol should consist of* tv/o men, working in pairs. They should be taken to their area by '’pick-up 1 * and dropped at a previously selected point, to be picked up later at another point. Each patrol should be able to work for four hours without relief, and during this time should visit certain selected wells. In order to check the action of patrols it will be an advantage if they can be supplied each with a time clock (the Oil Coy. has three such clocks) and if asparate keys could be fixed to each well-head. Hr. Me CO Iff EL thought it might be possible to arrange this*. space of time and during one of these 'blackout” periods the patrol should be dropped or picked up. Driving up and down with headlights on is useless. If sufficient men are available it will be an advantage if one man can accompany the s driver of each car and remain in the car throughout its tour./ \ The lookout post on the Jebel should be maintained by night in order to see Very Lights Signals. Each patrol should carry a Very pistol and several cartridges to give warning of any unusual occurrence. advantage by night, and this post could possibly be used as a Headquarters for certain patrols which would not then require M.T. to take them to their areas. closed ones and require guarding at night. Tv/o men should be sufficient. In order to ensure that these guards remain : wake it would be an advantage if a telephone could be installed at each open wellhead. Any stragglers found by the Defence Police should be apprehended and later handed over to the Civil Police. USE 0? RESERVES. 21. In the event of any unusual occurrence at the refinery or in the Oilfields area a small mobile force, moving in M.T., will be necessary to investigate and to deal with the situation, if any. A suitable Central Headquarters for the Mobile Force would appear to be the Native Camp near the refinery. The pick-up allotted to the refinery area might be used to augment other available transport in the event of this reserve having to move to the oilfields area.

The men should take with them full equipment (less anti-gas respirator) and bedding. It is advisable for the senior to be given the acting rank of Sergeant on arrival (as 2nd-in-command to the Arab Officer). The remaining three should be made acting Corporals. These acting ranks need not affect the question of pay. The F, Advsr. has agreed that the men should receive their present rates of pay, plus 2S^, free accommodation and rations (.Action by S.P.3.0, and O.C., ’Iraq Levies). NECESSITY FOR EXTRA POLICE FOR THE BAHREIN DEPENCE POLICE, 24. At present, only 50 of the police are ’’regulars 1 ’. 50 or 60 are natoors who have been employed for some time with the force and about 50 are natoors who have been employed only recently. The final numbers actually required for this force can only be judged after experience. It will probably be between 120 - 150. In the meantime, ^regulars” should be increased to 110 men. These should be given uniform, and specially trained. The balance required*up to the present total numbers employed*may be found from natoors, the best of which can be enlisted in the force later, v/hen the establish ment is increased. The Political advisor agreed but pointed out the difficulties of obtaining suitable uniform locally. He promised to do what he could to ensure that the force of 110 Defence Police was given uniform, including some form of warn clothing for wear during the winter months. He agreed that it was desirable for the D.0. to control enlistments and dis charges in this force. It was agreed that in order to avoiu. confusion and to discriminate between this force and the ’’metropolitan police”, the sx^ocial police force might be called, in future, the ’’BAHREIN DEPENCE POLICE FORCE”. The D.O. is to consider whether this is the most suitable title, and to inform A. H. Q. of the final decision reached, in due course. BLACIvOUT ARRANGEMENTS. r » MANAMA AND LfJilARRAK. £ ^ ~ /I'l 25. The main object at the present time is to avoid an excessive glow in the sky, and also to gradually educate the townspeople in Blackout measures. 3.A.3.0. said he was satis fied with the existing degree of preparation against the present degree of risk and thought that the blackout might be intensi fied gradually in the light of experience gained, and increased later if the risk became enhanced. The day to day danger of the Blackout to life and limb was mentioned. The D.O. is to advise the Local civil authorities concerned on the general measures to be adopted from time to time and is to refer questions of policy to Air Headquarters for decision.

The four pick-ups are used almost exclusively by the Special Defence Police (strength 150) for the defence of the oilfield and Refinery, under the orders of tire Defence Officer who commands these special Defence Police. They are used for patrol duty (which by night is continuous), for daily reliefs of uuru and posts, and for supervisory duties. In addition they are required in emergency for carrying rtLcrvo, to any threatened point. There would appear to be no difficulty about sending these ;eim-.nce, daily, providing that vehicles in for mail: they are released bp the Oil Company’s workshops within a short period. Owing to the need for the strictest economy, the provision of additional transport -port by the R.a.F. for the defence of the oilfield at Bahrein is not contemplated at the present time. The Defence Officer is to review the situation after a further period of two months, and report, in writing, to this Headquarters. In the meantime, when the new Defence Scheme has begun to function Satisfactorily, it may be possible to approach one or other of the Oil Company, the Bahrein Government or the sheikh with a view to the loan of any additional transport required, Thile H.k.G, is inter sted in the defence of the oilfield from the point of view of potential oil reserves and on account of treaty obligations, all the jother three parties are interested from a financial point of view. In particular it is suggested that the Sheikh might be approached at some favourable opportunity, after this possibility ha. jeen discussed with the political a p.nt and the British adviser* (S.E.S.O. , C.A, )Paje 4, (d) Provision o C Drivers: Po.yment for ono driver :as already been a seeond driver ) (to drive the hi) } and that ex- ) ..li .nt of the second 1/12/40).

(15) Rifle and Ilaokine dun Range ; It is noted that the existing range is owned and maintained by the Bahrein State, and that it is lent to mid used by the Local Defence Volunteers* As the State pays for all targets, etc., the question is under consideration at this Headquarters of making a annual grant to the State to assist in the upkeep of th small the range.

Transfer of Dynamite, the Proper ty of the Oil Company, to the Royal Naval Base at Juiair : It is agreed tnatthewo tons of dynamite whicli belong to the Oil Oompany (under trie control of die British Adviser) should be transferred to the Royal Naval Base at Jufair, for use in emergency by the Royal Navy, The Defence Officer is to take up this matter direct with the S.N.O.P.G., British Adviser and the General Kanager of the Oil Company.

Visit of Defenc e Officer to ^atar, Sharjah and Kuwait : It is noted that~~thV Defence Officer intends to visit Qatar shortly. Visits to' Qatar and Sharjah are to be made once every six months, and to Kuwait once every twelve months. Instructions regarding transport facilities for the first visit to Sharjah and Kuwait' respectively will be issued later. In the meantime, visits to these latter two places will be held in abeyance. Qlerk for Defence Officer: It is noted that a suitable clerk has now been found for the Defence Officer, and it is presumed that his wages will not be in excess of the amount previously authorised. IVith regard to the recommendation that the former clerk s :ould now be retained to deal with the Arabic work in connection with the Special Defence Police Porce, this would appear to be a matter for the concurrence of the British Adviser. It is considered that, as the Special Defence Police are a charge against the Bahrein Government, administrative personnel required in connection with this force should also be paid by the Bahrein Government. The necessity for an additional clerk in this connection is fully appreciated and if there is any difficulty over his being employed and paid by the Bahrein Government, an application for him to be paid out of service funds should be put up separately to this Headquarters, accompanied by a detailed statement of the C cloo • (S.P.S.O., G.A.)

His Majesty*s G-overnment has recorded the importance of refining and shipping oil products from Bahrein. the defense of the Field and Refinery against sabotage, which was considered to be the only menace to production. Until October 1940 air raids on Bahrein were considered unlikely in the extreme. defend the Refinery from aerial attack. It is admitted on all sides that these steps were designed more to give a sense of security than to be an active menace to an enemy; presumably be cause further air attack was still thought to be improbable. Now that attacks launched on Bahrein from the air have passed from the extremely unlikely to the extremely probable, and the importance of Bahrein oils has been enhanced by recent events in Iraq, is it not time for His Majesty’s Government to make serious attempts to give adequate anti-aircraft defense to this Island?

Damage inflicted by enemy action. 2. Damage to or demolition of our property by military authorities with the acquiescence of the Bahrein author ities . 3. The possibility that the Bahrein Government might insist upon sacrificing our property in order to protect their int erests.

Persian Gulf, 26th May, 1941. His Britannic Majesty's Political Agent, Bahrein Island. Dear Sir, On several occasions staff employees have asked us to clarify their position with the Company regarding compensation in case of injury or death from causes over which the Company have no control. As a company, we consider ourselves liable to our employees for any negligence on our part. Our staff employees are covered by insurance and receive compensation in accordance with the Compensation Act of the State of California, U.S.A. Our Indian and other native foreign employees are protected in accordance with the Compensation Laws of India. Our Bahreini employees are protected by the local courts. May we have your comments on the following points: - (1) - The Company cannot assume liability for any British, Indian, Iragtij Bahreini or other local employees who are injured or killed by enemy action, or by action arising during or from the defence of property against enemy action, or by other acts of war, or by the destruction of property by the Bahrein Government or H.M.G. We would like to know who will assume responsibility for claims by employees arising from such aAion. 77ill the Bahrein Government or H.M.G. entertain such claims? (2) - The Company admits no responsibility or liability for accidents or deaths involving employees belonging to the Local Defence Force while training, while protecting the Sheikh's property or when called upon for defensive action by H.M.G.- 2 - 26th May, 1941 The Bahrein Petroleum Company %111 not he liable for damage to personal or household effects of any employee living in Company quarters when such damage is the result of enemy action, or for damage arising from any cause other than negligence on our part during regular routine operations. The Company will not he responsible for members of employees* families who may be injured or killed by enemy action, or by action arising during or from the defence of property of the Bahrein Petroleum Company. Pamilies have been given notice by the Company that they are staying in Company quarters at their own risk. In this case, as in (1) above, who will assume the responsibility for claims arising from these circumstances. Will they be entertained by the Bahrein Government or H.M.G.?

The Company also wish to know whether the Government War Hisk insurance scheme can be extended to cover their interests in Bahrain* 3. The Bahrain State and His Majesty^ Government are taking all measures within their power at the present moment to protect the Island and the various interests therein* 4. As regards possible losses it would appear prima facie that damage by the enemy should be covered by insurance if the War Risk Insurance scheme can be extended to Bahrain* Damage by the Military Authorities would presumably be paid for by His Majesty’s Government and likewise damage by the Bahrain State would be paid for by it* _ ^ 5. In letter No. Cott-821 the Company deny their liability to compensate their employees for injury or loss arising from causes due to the war and request a ruling as to whether His Majesty’s Government or the Bahrain State will entertain such claims. a) /-- 2 \ (1) Claims on account of death or injury to employees as a result of the wart presumably these c la ins would be covered by War Risks Insurance t while claims due to action by His Maj esty* s (iovernment or the Bahrain State would be entertained by the Governnant responsible* (2) Claims on account of death or injury to members of the Local Volunteer Defence Force, while on military duty, would presumably be entertained by His Majesty^ Govern ment or the Bahrain State as the case may be* (3) Claims on account of damage to personal or household effects of amployeea; and (4) Claims on account of death or injury to members? of employees* families: These should presumably be covered by War Risks Insurance scheme. 6.

Hop er l&gt;. auction cir» Little enthusiasm has been shewn by sufficient numbers to attend a section leaders oourae, so tliat the holding of an examination of these volunteers is considered as of no value. It is now being tried as an experiment for Platoon Leaders to select their own Section Leaders, and generally to supervise the organization of their platoons. o. ■•eaaoa Trai:.lni--, Individual and collective practises have been held on the range. These have been fairly well attended. The results of Collective practises have tended to prove in some oases that Platoon and Section Leaders would prefer to fire a rifle or L.A. gun to actually oo^imand their units. This has been explained to them and an improve ment in this is expected in the future. a.

Sanction for local purchase of aim hands has been applied for. Signal dated 16th May to A*H. i* These are, it Is considered, necessary should the occasion arise for the volunteers to be embodied. f. Training of Aineurjoaas As there are very few Americans now in Bahrain other than key men, the necessity for arranging for training of these men may be shelved. g. Although there is a pro^iortion of volunteers who are keen in the extreme, it cannot be said that the foroe as a whole shows the enthusiasm that is required to make for efficiency. A fair number will turn, up on the range to shoot, but very few will trouble to attend parades for instruction in weapon or other training. It is of course difficult for many men who are on Shift duties to attend all or many parades. This is receiving attention. It is felt that were an emergency to arise the attendance would be 100$ but largely of untrained volunteers. It is ceing triec. to work up enthusiasm through platoon lancers, and It is thought that perixaps the arrival of an assistant instructor isay help in dividing up classes so that recruits will not be holding back more experienced volunteers. 4. Authority has been received for the purchase of two new Two Ton Trucks locally. One has been delivered and the seconc is almost ready. The Station Waggon, and the Three Ton Truck ore both immobile, (iiisnal to A.H. i. dated 17th May).

This position visualises that in certain circumstances employees might be called upon to take up anas to assist in the defence of Company property, and for some time to fire Light Machine Guns in the Refinery. To make Volunteers efficient for such action, and also not to be a danger to themselves or others, a certain amount of training is necessary I would request therefore, before going into the matter further with Volunteers, that a ruling be given as to whether an employee would be debarred from Company benefits, payable for death or disablement, as the result of an accident, not attri butable directly to enemy action should such an accident occur during the abovenentioned training. It is considered that the chances of such an accident are extremely remote. I would again emphasise that it is clearly understood that Volunteers who take on Military duties, other than those in assisting in the defence of Company property, are debarred from receiving the benefits and bonuses granted by the Company. Yours very truly, (signed) H. T. Hewitt. Major. Defence Officer, Persian Gulf.Awali, 3th July, 1941. Major H. Hewitt, Defence Officer Persian Gulf. BAHREIN. Dear Sir, / A Please refer to your letter Def/Air/S/ll of ilAw F 1 ’ 1941 on the subject of payment of disability benefit to our employees engaged in defence operations. 1) . fle wish to point out that the payment of a benefit to employees disabled or killed as a direct result of war action is' a voluntary and ex gratia proposition on the part of the Company and may be modified or cancelled at ?iny time. The Company does net admit any liability in this regard amanating from the xact that it is making such a voluntary offer. Further, in denying this benefit to employees disabled or killed due to war action, no tiling has been taken away from than timt they aid not already have under their contracts. 2) . The Company does not feel willing to pay benefits to err^ployees disabled or killed during off duty hours whiie engaged in training or other defence organization activities not under the direct charge of the Company. 3) . The Company is not willine to pay benefits to employees disabled or killed while engaged in aexending or patrolling non-Company properties. 4). The Company will, subject to modification, pay benefits to employees disabled or killed as a direct result of war action while engaged in defending Company property If such is done during their regular tour Oj. duty in the Company operations. If, on the other hand, our employees are called out by the defence Officer and acting under his orders are disabled or killed while defending company properties, the Company may not pay such benefits. The Company is awaiting further instructions from our b^incipals ind ^hc ©ntdre bsnsfjJt schom© and th© abov© instructions are subject to modification.

The Awali Camp, which is surrounde/^fd by a wire fence, is to all purposes already a restricted area. Company guards are stationed on the three gates and all persons passing through the gates on foot or in cars are scutinized. Members of the public, apart from Europeans, are not allowed free access to the Camp. In fact the entrance of people into the Awali Camp area is more strictly controlled than in the case of some other prohibited areas, such as the oil field. I see no objection to the Camp area being officially declared a Prohibited Area. Regarding the entrance of undesirables into the Camp, the prevention of persons of this type from passing through the gates has in the past rested in the hands of the Bapco authorities. The Bahrain Government is willing to co-operate in this matter and has lately been enforcing an old Municipal rule which forbids taxi drivers to carry prostitutes but the Police have no authority to stop and search private cars which may be used for this sort of traffic.Confidential No. C/118-28/1-K.

(2) Any such division shall not affect the provisions contained in sub clause (3) of clause 22 but, so long as the member to whom the pension is originally awarded continues to be alive and eligible, if any member receiving one of the divided portions of the pension dies or ceases to be eligible, his share shall be added to the amount distributable to the member or members still surviving and eligible. (3) A division under this clause shall not ordinarily be made at the instance of children in receipt of children’s allowances, but the Claims Officer may even in such a case at his discretion make a division of the family pension to avert special hardship. nTHE GAZETTE OF INDIA EXTRAORDINARY, JANUARY 1, 1942 39 25.

He replied that as things stand at present his Company could only pay wlaatever might be fo-nd to be due under the Indian foreman’s Compensation Act. He w*.s willing, however, to recommend to his Principals the acce rtance of further liabili ties if similar concerns in the Middle last and India, such as the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the Attoc’&lt;c Oil Company, etc., had accepted s ich liabilities. 5. I presume that employers in India are not liable to pay compensation to their employees for injuries received In the course of their employment as the result or' enemy action, but should be grateful for a ruling on this point. So far as the Anglo-Persian Oil Company are concerned it appears from paragraph ^fv Cr '-J—g) j p. 2 (f fvh t 1 &lt;7 — 2 of m ehran tel gram No.44 of 26th February 1942 that they have as yet made no special arr&gt; ngements for their Indian employ* ^ and no infoirretion is available regarding their proposal so far as their Persian employees are concerned.

In the preceding paragr^ £he I have considered only the question of the payment of oo mpensation to the employees of the Bahrain Petroleum Company for war injuries received whilo they are serving on the Company’s premises.

Healdantial area and coolie caiaps* (a) Air raid shelters have been built to accommodate all personnel. The specifications and design of the shelters have been approved by O.H.Q. INDIA. (b) Instruction In first »id measures la given to the employees. (c) First aid equipment is provided by the Coy and earmarked for all areas. 3. Fields area. (a) Personnel, only X men live in the fields area, these men should be provided for %*ith slit trenches. £ (b) Wells. The eight most important wells have sub-surface rotectlon. e remaining working wells have sand bag and reinforced concrete protection st the well heads. Automatic excsss velocity shut down valves are provided in 58 of the walls. These valves shut off the flow of oil in the evjnt of any damage securing at the well head. (o) Tank batteries have pot been protected, they are not considered to be a worth while target for air attack and are not aaaentlal to the running of the plant. 4. Tha refinery and tank farm. (a) This ares Is very compact having been designed for operation by the minimum number of personnel operating under peace time conditions. The construction of adequate P.A.D. measures is difficult for reasons given in para 5 below. (b) Two reinforced concrete shelters and 12 open sand bagged shelters have been provided. The high sub soil water level in this area precludes the construction of slit trenches. The Company agree to construct a third reinforced concrete Shelter in the area between the crocking and acid plants. They also agreed to re-construct all sand bag shelters. (c) Fire fighting appliances are being dealt with in a special report by Cept. Bradford. The following is a brief resume of the chief points brought out. The existing appliances are adaquate for paace time operation but not for operation under war conditions. There is s 6* water main throughout tha fields area but fire hydrants are only 1} inch. The Coy agreed to replacing the existing pipes with 4' Fisers and two 2 &gt; hydrants to serve the tank batteries. 80.000 lbs of foam powder la now available, more has been ordered and tha coy wish to procure at least 160,000 Ibi Two foam towers exist and two more are being made. The intention is to have one foam tower at ZSL1AQ one at 3ITRA and TWO in the main tank farm.An lnor«aa« In th* number of mobile water pumps for fire fighting was considered. It was suggested that three and if possible five 330 +oQQ trailer pumps should be made available* Slr.Fifer chief engineer of the Oil Coy who has recently returned from India understands that there is a shipment of 0000 trailer pumps on route to India froai the C.3.A# The fire fighting appliances at the deep sea wharf are not designed to compete with an oil tanker fire* A blast wall is to be built round the emergency fire pump house In the refinery. (d) Five walls in the tank farm area varying from 4ft 6 Ins to 7 ft have been constructed. Drains have also been made to take off oil from damaged or burst tanks to areas where it can burn with safety. It wsa recommended and the Coy agreed to double the width of the existing drains. (e) Pipe lines. The London Petroleum Board recommend that all pipe lines should be buried and covered to e minimum depth of £’6 rt with earth. This is not considered practicable in BaHRAIK owing to the extreme corrosive qualities of the soil. Pipe lines that were originally buried have had to be replaced or raised above ground level to avoid corrosion. Pipe lines in the refinery area are now laid in trenches and protected by aide walls wherever poealbls* The main difficulties in the construction of adequate P.A.D. measures may be sumnerieed as unden ts) Lack of materials. In order to comply with the specifications laid down hythe London Petroleum Board the following is an estimate of the total materials required for concrete construction. Cement Sand Hock Steel Tons to' CU' y&lt;*v Tons 23,000 35,000 66,500 500 Of the above materials sand is available but is 13 miles from the refinery. Hock is available but outrope are scatter ed and have to be quarried. Steel and cement are IfOT avail able locally ond would have to be imported. A certain amount of timber would also have to be imported. The existing rock crushing and cement mixing machinery Is very limited* additional machinery would have to be imported. The capacity of the present existing machinery is f- Bock crusher 40 cu yds per 34 hour day Cement mixers 96 cu yds per 34 hour day. In addition there are two P.H. cranes for loading trucks. Twelve dump trucks each 5 cu yds capacity, these are normally used for coking operations. (b) Labour * The American and British staff now available is sufficient only for normal operations. Tbs Coy may be called on and have made preliminary preparations to double their present output of refined products* This increased output will amount to approximately 8000 tons per day. It is estimated that from the redeipt of the final order to increase output it will take 30 days to complete the change over of the process units to complete with the Increased output Few extra personnel are required for this increase.(c) Native labour up to approximately 6000 coolies could be recruited. This labour would require a supervising staff which is &amp;&amp; available locally. It ie estimated that there would be a time lag of 3 - 4 months before full scale constructional operations could be realised. The Coy estimate that to complete all tank sheathing end blast wall construction recommended by the London petroleum board, would take 12-16 months from the date of avsliability of the necessary materials. This estimate is baaed on having equipment to handle 280 cu yds of concrete per day after reaching maximum output. vork of this type can normally be put out to contract. Thare are no such contractors at Ba t HAJW 0 (d* Blast walls round equipment that now has only head cover will restrict the escape of fumes and will increase eonaldarsbly the temperature under which personnel have to work. (e) There is no brick available on the Island. Assuming th«t reinforced concrete construction# can not be carried out owing to non evaliability of materials the following suggestions are put forward - (a; Blast walls of the local rock and gypsum mortar ba construe ted round buildings containing vital equipment . e.g. power house, SOgplant etc., and petrol tanks. &lt;b) Products with a high volatility be stored in tanks which, if hit, can xsoat readily be emptied without danger to surrounding tanks or plant. (c) Suggestion (b&gt; above involves changing over from ttUok oil tanka to white oil tanks and the reconstruction of a numbar of pipe lines. The Coy point out that this la not practicable from their point of view. They have agreed as an interim measure to construct extra drains and five walla from tanka containing petrol. Protection against possible sabotage and fifth column elements. (a) The Befinery including power house «nd «*ln tank farm, tank batteries, MALI Camp and pumping stations at KHLLA'1' and SITrtA are enclosed in steel wire fences; s proportion of the personnel are permanently on duty, all exlta and entrances are guarded by special armed police who are undet the oowiand of th«a Defence Officer Persian 3ulf. No one without a special oil Coy peas la allowed to enter unless accompanied by &amp;n official of the Oil Coy. (b) The fields area is patrolled by armed guards in ft.?, fro© 1800 hr a to 0700 hr a, during which period every well and tank battery is visited four times. A special method of clock punches ensures an accurate check on the work of the patrols. By day state police mounted on camels c-n be made available to patrol the area» In addition Coy personnel are constantly visiting the wells and tank batteries in the normal course of their duties. (c) A mobile force of special defence police can be turned out at vary abort notice by day or night to reinforce anv threatened area. This force is under the command of the Defence Officer Persian Gulf and consists of - Officer 1 (IRAQI)© (fe Officer Other ranks Mnm Tpt Cers Lorries 2 ton Lorries 3 ton Ford pick ups 1 (IRAQI) 160 BAHRAINIS Rifles and bayonets 1 2 1 4 (provided by oil Coy) 5 In addition there are 4 Police Sgts specially seconded frcsi the Indian Police to assist the (d) Co-oporetion with the BAfPiAIH (Jovt is good and any persoj caught trespeeeing is adequately dealt with. (e) the above measures are considered adequate against any existing threat of sabotage, but would not be sufficient to deal with trained saboteurs in the event of the eneny being able to lend any on the Island. Camouflage and deception. (a) Air photographs of the refinery and camp area taken from 10,000 ft have been studied r«nd jaeasuree to disguise the acre obvious installations are now in hand. (b) Those measures Include the oiling of all roofs of buildinj and tanks also large areas of the surrounding ground so that it will be difficult to pick out buildings from high bombing level. An area at least tv#ic« the else of the refinery will be so treated. (o) A similar eree of ground is to be oiled to represent a dummy refinery, gas pipe llnee will be led to this area end small light jets lit to duplicate those of the refinery proper, Reserves of oil and high pressure gas can be made avail able st the dtoftoy refinery to start fires in the event of bombing. (d) The present pipe lines from the refinery to the loading wharf will be sprayed with s mud solution to tone in with the background. Lines from the dunny refinery can be represented by lines of thick oil or pitch. (e) The Coy request that an expert be esnt to BAHMIW to give theca advice on camouflage. P.A.D. measures for local inhabitants ere practically not existent. (a) A few trenches have ben dug in the area of the Police barracks and schools. These trenches are straight, have no traverses and are too wide. It is not possible to dig deep slit trenches owing to the high eub soil water level. (b) No air raid shelters have yet been constructed, it is considered that this is a responsibility of the BAHRAIN Govt. (c) In the event of enemy bombing it is probable th$t a large proportion of the civil population would take to the sea in dhows. 3•mir* 10* Oba*rv&lt;sr pasta do not axlat, nor la It to alta any oxcept on tba 3AHRAXK ISLANDS# Little If any warning am therefore he prior to enei^y air action# Sirens exist at the| and AWALI Cmv t it is understood that one has also been ordered for the STOW Aharf in connection with iaine welching. 11. 1 understand that the coat of P.A.D* measures already undertaken by the Oil Coy. amounts to between C 40f0CC — f o0 f 000. 12* The CouTipany were most helpful end co-operative in every way.

PROTECT I Oil OF BAHREIN OIL FIELD Dear Sir, The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited in the near future contemplates starting a program of well •orotection designed entirely to reduce^the amount of work involved, and hence the time required, to assure adequate preservation of petroleum resources in the event of the island falling temporarily into enemy hands. all reasonable steps to protect the wells from sabotage and aerial bombing and the program suggested here will give an extra measure of protection. which the enemy could not produce oil from it or sabotage the reservoir upon being driven out again, and thus 1°^® for ever the oil resources, several months of work would be required. This is due to the nature of the reservoir, / the Bahrein field consisting of flowing wells under several hundred pounds pressure. 7/e believe therefore it is highly desirable to proceed with a program of doing a certain amount of this work at this time to reduce the amount of work necessary to be done in case the military situation deteriorates. Y/ill you please inform the Bahrein G-overnment to this effect and let'us have your reaction to our proposal. The company feels that it has already taken In order to place the field in a condition in The proposed program consists of placing a cement CHIEF LOCAL REPRESENTATIVE.Confidential No. C/407 Political Agency, Bahrain, the 3rd April, 1942.

Request urgent orders on important defence issue raised by BAPCO in regard to oil field. 2. Adequate steps have already been taken to protect wells from damage by sabotage or aerial bombing. Company now propose work programme to block wells in such a manner that hostile forces in temporary occupation of Bahrain could neither make use of nor destroy for ever resources of oil field. 3. There are two methods of blocking flowing wells under pressure. First or Protective Method involves insertion in well of cement plug for 100 feet above oil level. Second or Sabotage Method involves blocking whole well solid with cement. 4. Treatment by Protective Method takes between two and three days per well. To drill through cement plug and re-open well thus treated would take three weeks assuming drilling equipment s. 6. MFP—1200 8&amp;P —(M-1723)—4-2-38—200,000* WSPS /-were available. 5. By Sabotage Method three wells per day could be treated. Wells thus treated would not in practice be re opened since it would be cheaper and quicker to drill new wells. 6. Company now propose programme as follows. (Note.- The following figures are approximate only). There are seventy producing wells. Eighty two per cent of oil now produced comes from thirty wells in centre of field. Eighteen per cent comes from forty wells in outer portion of field. Company propose to undertake immediately Protective treatment of forty wells in outer portion of field. Completion of this programme would take between three and four months. If emergency arose before completion of programme of Protective treatment Sabotage Method would be applied. If Protective programme were c ompleted without emergency arising position would be satisfactory as remaining thirty wells could be treated by Protective Method in 2£ months or if necessary by Sabotage Method in period of ten days. 7. This programme does not seriously affect production. Present production is 18000 barrels per day. Optimum pro duction is 20000 barrels. Maximum production is 25000. A a programme of Protective treatment proceeds on outer wells production from centre wells will be increased. Ultimately, when Protective programme is completed, present production of 18000 barrels per day will be maintained from centre wells with maximum figure 20000 instead of 25000. Any demand for increased oil supplies can be met by CASOC. 8. Have not approached Bahrain Government but expect favourable reaction from Shaikh. Time is essential factor and earliest orders are therefore solicited.From Ambassador, I To Political Agent, Bahrain, /o^ ' ^*^7 Dated 10th received 11th April 1942. ^ IMMEDIATE. Telegram S.

The Bahrain Petroleum Company have the same double objective as ourselves i.e. to deny the use of Bahraini oil resources to the enemy and at the same time to ensure their preservation. The Bahrain Petroleum Company do not ask for advice as to the best method of achieving this objective. They ask for per mission to put in hand at once the work of well protection, and I recommend that this permission be granted immediately. As soon as permission is granted I will ensure that work on the wells starts without delay in accordance with whichever programme the Company may by then have decided upon.

The meeting opened with Brigadier Ilinnis giving a brief summary of the discussions arrived at by informal consulta 1 tion with the Oil Coy Representatives or CO Apr A2. Discussion had. revealed the fact that Defence projects could not he executed within reasonable time in steel and concrete because of the shortage of material‘and plant... ■ It was therefore agreed that the work must he executed in Eric!:. It had been ascertained that bridles were avail a' le in Prc and could-^e shipped in sufficient quantities to Bahrein and that by adopting this policy a' sufficient flow of all essential materials could be maintained to lie op pace with planned construction without affecting the priority, or date of completion, of other projects. 2 . : ' Col. -Early stated that the first shipment of material could' commence on the 5th Fay and it was agreed that this first ship load of brichs, cement, etc. to start the scheme should be despatched, 3. Art E.E. Officer (rajor Hills) was now beinf sent to Bohrein by the r.G.B.E. Tenth Army to prepare a detailed estimate of requirements and cofcts on the snot but the firs': despatch of material would not be delayed on that account as essential worh must be started ivr/.ediately. 4. It was agreed that the estimate of costs as required by Troopers (Signal No ,76349/HOG dated 14 Mar 42) and J {ideas t (oignal No.0/76207 dated 23 Mar 42) must await Major Hills’ report which would be available, it was hoped, in about ten days time. Mr. Bowlby, B* ihdad Petroleum Board considered that it was better to await a reasonably firm estimate before framing a reply to the foreign Office.As a very rough guess it was thought that the total scherae for protection would prooahly cost about £500,000 hut that the essential work which could he carried out within the next six months, which would provide protection for vital points only, would prohahly cost about £150,000, ^ The limiting factor was the transportation of material to Bahrein, rather than the availability of material and labour. 5* The scheme lor the protection of oil installations as ? re ju: rec ^ a 'k Bahrein was examined and accepted subject to the following modifications:- u (a) Brick to be substituted for steel and cement. (b) The time given for completion of the scheme as suggested by B.A.P.C.0. must depend on such uncertain ^ Cu ^ s , as availability of shipping. It was therefore unreliable as a guide. (c) The use of oricxs would obviate the necessity for crushing plant^ etc, and the fullest use would have to oe made o± xoc* _ resources for transport. w ^ s noted that the protection of loading linpq iq o a Ually extended in accordance with an ordered priority. protection 1 ^ to , a ^ ieve a certain measure of on as early dS Possiale ana the ultimate scheme involved:- (a) hTLtTl?

Your comments would be appreciated before the attached letter is answered. Yours very truly, THE BAHREIN PETROLEUM COMPANY, LTD. , WPAiSW CHIEF LOCAL REPRESENTATIVE Attach: 1CONFIDENTIAL Medioal Stores, April 14th, 1942. The General Manager, Bahrein Petroleum Co. Ltd., Awali. Sir, Permit me to express my gratitude to my employers for the grant of a War allowance to C.T. Employees. I assure you that all my efforts will always directed in the best interests of my employers as I have done during past 5 years of my service in this concern. It will be highly appreciated if the Company would declare her policy towards the C.T. (Indian) employees and their families in Bahrein in the event of a possible blockade of sea passages, air raids, enemy attack or local disturbances* as to what course the Company would adopt tfien for their and their families safety, evacuation and supply of food stuff. In the event of a death of a C.T(Indian) employee due to enemy action will the dependents of the employee receive any compensation from the Company and be evacuated to another safer zone by Air? It is a fact that the Indian employees will be in same plight what the other imported employees of the Company would be in then, and they would need as much help of their employers as would be granted to others. Hope to be favoured with an early reply so as to relieve anxiety of the Indian C.T. employees. Thanking you I remain, Sir, Yours respectfully, (signed) B. 5.

No.C/565. 7%^ Political Agency, Bahrain, the 30th April 1942• To The Chief Local Representative, Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited, Awali. Dear Sir, Please refer to your letter No•CON-9 dated 15th April 1942. 2. In the second paragraph of his letter Mr.Madhok enquires what policy the Company would pursue towards its C.T. Indian Employees in the event of certain grave con tingencies arising. The answer is, presumably, that the Company is doing, and will continue to do, everything in its power to ensure the safety and protect the interests .. of its employees. The action that they will take in time at that time of crisis will depend upon the circumstances existing^and cannot be determined in advance; but the Company's employees can be assured that the best possible arrangements will be made for their security. 3. In regard to the question of compensation raised in the third paragraph of Mr. Madhok*s letter, the position is as follows. At a discussion held at Awali in March 1942 Colonel Hay asked Mr. Lipp what compensation the Company would pay for Indian or Bahraini subjects killed or disabled as a result of war action. Mr. Lipp replied that, as things stand at present, the Company could only pay whatever might be found to be due under the Indian Workman* s Compensation Act. He was willing, however, to recommend to his Principals the acceptance of further liabilities if similar concerns in / the-2- o the Middle East and India, such as the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company, the Attock Oil Company etc M had accepted such liabilities. 4. The Political Resident is finding out what liabil ities in this respect have been accepted by Companies such as those mentioned above, and you will be informed in due course of the result of those inquiries. Meanwhile, Mr.Madhok might, I suggest, be informed that the question of compensation in respect of death cuased to an Indian employee of the Company as a result of enemy action has been taken up with me.

H.Q. , 10th Array. brflll/'ti 23th April, 1942 SUBJECT: P.A.D. - Bahrein Potroleim Cocop^ny Limited I - C&amp;Ui&amp;UL. 1) • At the meeting he tween members or the Petroleum Committee and the 10th Army held in HD on April 21 and 22, it was agreed in principle that additional P.A.^). measures should be undertaken, the target being the ratTiTwiCT protection possible in the shortest time, taking into account stores available. 2) . I have made a reco' naisance of the Company's property; and in order to present a clear picture of the problem it is necessary briefly to conaent on a) layout of the property b) P.A.D. proposals already put forward c) time factor d) P.A.D. works existing or under construction e) possible additional P.A.D. works Finally, a recommended scheme is considered in detail. ii - mmi; The Bahrein Petroleum Company possess oilfields; Refinery; and storage and shipping tankage at two outlyinr sites. The whole have been laid out and developed with a view to efficient peace-time production; and consequently there is not the dispersion desirable for war-time requirements.F&amp;ee 2\ Bahrein and. isade P.A-D. propoaala, some of which have been put in force hy the Company. Some of these proposals were made apparently without due consideration of the peculiar existing conditions - vis. congestion of plant and tanks, extreme climate, etc. - which preclude the adoption of the ideal scale of protection as set out hy the Petroleum Board, London, in their Mamorandua dated 19th July, 1941. and in view of the fluid nature of the war it has been agreed unwise to embark on a long term program. v - Kmcx^QY OF ^ohking m:r hot m Any P.A.D. works which seriously interfere with the efficient working of the Company should be avoided; it being of vital importance to the war effort that production is not impeded. a) «ight important wells are equipped with packers which prevent flow of oil up annular space between casing and tubing; and excess velocity chokes in tubing itself, which prevent flow of oil in event of damage to surface connections. Concrete walls and a concrete slab 8* thick protect wells at surface. b) All other important wells (about 50) are protected by concrete walls round head, cellar filled, with sand bags and a reinforced concrete slab. Wells are equipped with excess velocity chokers o) 2 or 3 small wells are not protected. d) The 5 tank batteries - a difficult target - are not protected. Kven if 2 were out of action the production of the field could continue e) Air raid shelters for personnel. f) Adequate fire fighting equipment is being installed. g) Oiling, for camouflage purposes, is in haul. To effect complete protection would take very many months VI - mSTIHO ?.0T.:C7iyL WQBK3. i) Fields:Rage 3- ■^Cjo TwWi a) Concrete shelters, with sand hag “blast walls. h) Sand bag and steel protection to certain vital points. c) Individual tanks each surrounded with earth bank to prevent spread of oil in case of rupture. d) emergency drains, to carry away oil from Refinery. e) aoofs of buildings, tanks, pipe lines, roads and area surrounuing refinery have been oiled for camouflage purposes. f) Fire fighting equipment exists equal to any peace time requirements. ill) SUra: The same, generally, as for Refinery, iv) The same, generally as for Refinery. n&amp;TRCTiin; ^orks • The following additional works have beon proposed at different times, or are recossaendod in the Petroleum Board Memorandum• Commonts on each proposal are made* (It should be noted that owing to the rocky nature of uaost of the ground, deep penetration by bombs appears to be unlikely; and in consequence there will be an unusually large amount of lateral blast). 1) . Development of existing works - shelters, drainage, firo fighting equipment, oiling, etc. This is recommended and the Company are continuing to develop the existing program. 2) . Blast walls in Operating Squipoent. It woul&lt; be possible to erect some blast walls, thereby isolating large blocks of plant. This is NOT recommended. a) the useful effect of such walls would be small. b) owin: to climatic conditions it Is absolutely essential t*iat as much free circulating air as possible is maintained, both for personnel &amp;r#i working plant; and walls would seriously interfere with this. o) the efficient working of the Refinery would be greatly reduced.VIII u Page Z). Construction of IXrangy itefinary. Nfo suitable site exists nearer than about 5 miles, which might be too far to be effectiye. Con siderable expense would be entailed; much labour needed which might bo ’nore profitably used on other works; and a large amount of cement or gutoh would hare to be imported. Taking into account, also, the somewhat doubtful value of a dummy refinery, it is recomaended that the project be shelved for the time being. 4) . Fire Fighting .QUiimont to be increased. It la reeooEianded that Fire Fighting :quii*ient be increased as suggested in the Bahrein Petroleum Company's Itemorandum dated 21st April, 1942; and it Is understood the Company hare this matter in hand. 5) . Sheathing of Process and Storage Tanks* This is recommended. It is suggested that all tanks be sheathed to an agreed height as soon as possible; and that an increased height of sheathing be then given to tanks containing the more volatile products if the state of war then existing, warrants it. The Company's engineers agree that this course is preferable to the complete sheathing of some tanks first, leaving others entirely un protected. The tanks number approximately 80 E The Company request covering sanction for works already carried out and now in hand; and are prepared to start on the tank shea tiling scheme as soon as approval is obtained. It is understood that they require this approval to be given throui^i the medium of The Political Agent, Bahrein. 3. Illllfl. Major, JUS. Bahrein; 23th April, 1942.AJ^^K ’A' 1) . The only local materials available In any quantity arc sand and rock. The latter Is not suitable for sails of the required height, and in any case the use of rock would entail using a large quantity of cement. The rock will be crushed and used as aggregate. 2) . It is understood that the use of concrete is to be kept as low as possible, owing to cement shortage; and that bricks will be used. It is proposed to erect sheath walls of brickwork built in cement mortar (1 : 3), on reinforced concrete foundations (1:2:4). 3) . The possibility of losing certain local materials which are obtainable in small quantities is being investigated, 'iflit for tha purposes of estimating requirements it must be assumed that all necessary bricks, cement and steel will have to be imported 1) . At the Refinery» i»a. for 90t of tho work, rock exists close to the ground level. Concrete foundations 2*O'* wide, average depth 2*6*, reinforced with i* rods are proposed - see attached blueprint. 2) . At Sitra and Sellaq the ground Is soft and it will be necessary to spread the weight, with a consequent increase in concrete and reinforcement. Bearing tests are being carried out by the Company smii 1) . The first stage will consists of a brickwall, 18' tiJLck, 10•0' high to each tank. As the foundations product 1 •6' above ground, this will give protection to 11 *6'*. 2) . It is rocomended that tho final total height of wall shall be SO'O*. By limiting the height to this figure the thickness of wall at base need not exceed 18'. If 30*0' Is over to bo exceeded, a wall thicker at the base will have to bo constructed NOW; thereby increasing the time to give this initial protection by approximately 20$. The tanks vary in height from 25'0' to 46*0*', but are seldom full; and it is reasonable to assume that a 30*0* sheath will to all intents and purposes give complete protection. . The complete 30*0' shaath will be as follows - up to I'd' 2 f 6' of concrete 1*6* to 14*0' 18* brickwork 14’0' to 25*0' 13*' do. 25*0' to 30*0' 9 M do. 3)1J. The value of the protective work is largely dependent on the time token to complete. Provided that IL the x^ouired plant and transport is available, and that necessary stores are delivered to schedule, yl it is estimated that protection to all tanks will he ooBjplete as follows 1st stage - 11 # 6* 2nd stage - 20* 0' 3rd stage - 30* 0' 3 months from start of work, additional 45 days, additional 45 days. - a total of 6 raontlis for complete protection to 30* 0*. 2). It is proposed that plant and transport shall he worked 16 hours per day, ? days a week; arkl that personnel shall work 6 days a week*1) . The Ccc^pany hare following plant available i- a) 1 Bock crusher - output 40 ^.yaixls per 24 liours. h) armll concrete tnizer: total output 4-5 c.y&amp;a. per hour. o) 3 caterpillar tractors. d) 14 rook busters; and air compressor. 2) . The following additional plant is required : - a) 4 concrete mixers, large as possible (2 coming on first shipment, 2 more required). b) 2 stone crushers.

The object of the pro gramme put forward is to provide against the contingency of hostile occupation of Bahrain. 2. On the morning of 6th April I discussed this programme in detail with officials of the Bahrain Petroleum Company. The following were present at the discussion:- The Political Resident, the Political Agent, tMr.Ward Anderson, Mr.Crow and Mr.Godfrey. In the course of the discussion the following facts and figures were given which it may be useful to have on record. 3. The Bahrain oilfield is oval in shape. The best producing wells are in the centre and production diminishes as the oil lake becomes shallower towards the edges. The oil must be drawn up evenly and not at too fast a rate or 'coning” develops i.e. the stratum of water below the oil lake is forced towards the surface. J-t would be physically possible to produce * &lt;*' no » * i * 150.000 barrels a day from the Bahrain oilfield but this would result in the ruin of the field in a very short period. Present production at the field is 18.000 barrels per day, optimum production is 20.000 barrels per day, maximum production is 25.000 barrels per day. 4. There are at present 72 producing wells in the field. Of these 30 are in the central area and are the best producers, while 42 are in the outer area and are less prolific. The local management have not yet agreed with their New York Principals in regard to the particular wells which, according to the programme now proposed, will be blocked with cement by the Protective Method. The local manage ment propose however that the 42 outside wells should be blocked now by the Protective Method while the remaining 30 wells in the centre of the field should remain in production. 5. The wells to be plugged produce only 17.5% of the total output. It is proposed to distribute this percentage amongst the remaining 30 wells in the centre. 6. There are 2 methods of blocking wells,iThe first method may be described as the Protective Method. This involves filling with cement to a height of 100 feet above the oil level the tube of the well and its lu-wIb where at present there are P ^vide sketch belowj CLckifi. f ft - $ t sfat ^ c trb ■- uitL I** (oo n it takes between two and three days to plug a well by the Protective Method. To drill out the plug and reopen the well would take about 3 weeks assum-that, were available* ?• The second, or Sabotage Method^of blocking a well is to pump cement both into the tube and down the sides, t'he tube is thus cemented in and the whole well is blocked solidly* This method wrecks the well but, of course, pre serves the oil below. Wells can be blocked by the Sabot age Method at the rate of‘three wells pet day. A well blocked by the Sabotage Method would not in practice be re-opened since it would be cheaper and quicker to drill a new well. 8. In the Bahrain oilfield there is a pressure of 400 to 500 pounds per square inch* If, therefore, a single well were left unblocked the whole of the oil reservoir would dis charge itself through this opening. This is particularly the case if the open well were near the centre of the field* 9. The question of loading facilities was a Iso discussed. At Sitra there are berths for two tankers and it is possible to load two tankers every 24 hours. To keep exports of oil at their maximum tankers must come at regular intervals as otherwise storage in tanks is not sufficient. This makes the convoy system in regard to tankers impracticable - or at least wasteful of time - in respect of Bahrain oil. 10. Seven barrels of oil are roughly equivalent to c one ton Mr. Anderson said that of the oil at present exported from Bahrain 60 per cent comes from the Island and 40 per cent from the mainland. 8/4/42.I have had a further conversation with Mr. »iard Anderson on the subject of oil well pro tection. He informed me that if a well in the r centre of the field were drilled out after being plugged and were then set alight the whole of the oil lake ,would probably be destroy-r ed. if, however, a well on the perimeter of the field were treated in this way the results would not be nearly so serious. 2.Mr.Ward Anderson said that if all wells were treated by the Sabotage Method the oil field would probably be out of commission for as much as two years. With reference to his statement that it would take 3 weeks to reopen a well treated by the Protective Method Mr.An derson explained that this was on the assumption that drilling equipment and drilling records were available. J-f drilling records were not available it might take months to reopen a single well successfully. The techhical difficulties of such a process were very great. He added that the originals of all drilling re cords had been sent for. safety to America. Copies kept in Bahrain would, of course, be destroyed in case of emergency. 11/4/42. 11/4/42. 2-</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000036_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/661</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000036</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/661</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>‘File 28/1 K I Defence of oil field and refinery’</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1939/1942</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2015-08-26T21:04:59</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (340 folios)</extent><extent>The file’s contents are arranged in approximate chronological order, from the earliest item at the front to the latest at the end.
