                           Bon Voisinage Agreement and Exchanges of Notes between the United Kingdom and Italy, agreed in Rome on 16 April 1938. The booklet is labelled Treaty Series No. 31 (1938), and published by His Majesty’s Stationery Office, London, 1938. A cover slip (folio 2) indicates that the booklet was sent by the Secretary of the Political Department in the India Office, and that copies were also sent to India, Bushire, Koweit [Kuwait], and Muscat.Annex 3 is the one most pertinent to British officials in the Gulf, in that it relates to certain areas of the Middle East, namely: Saudi Arabia and Yemen. It concerns an agreement not to interfere in each other’s affairs and possessions in the Red Sea; those islands in the Red Sea to which Turkey had renounced its rights to; and Britain’s Aden protectorate. Other regions and places covered by the annexes include: the Mediterranean, the Suez Canal, East Africa, and Lake Tsana [Tana] in Ethiopia. It also covers the exchange of military information between the two countries, the use of propaganda, and Italian assurances on Spain and her possessions.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><geographic>Suez Canal</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Yemen</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Mediterranean Sea</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Saudi Arabia</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Red Sea</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Anglo-Italian Agreements (1938)</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000020#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000020#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
