Dear Renaei, Please refer to Ryan's letter to Warner Ho. 1898/81/118 of the 25th June last, concerning e possible oil concession in 'Aslr. The Indian Vice-Consul was re conversation by luleyaan Ofcbil (No.40(1) in Jedd© Personalities) that one of the subjects discussed by f'uad Hamsa with the Italians during his late visit to Poae was that of an oil concession in the Parsan Islands. The reference was brief and consisted principally of a speculation as to Fuad's motives (i.e. of personal gain) in pursuing this question with the Italians. It la, I think, interesting in view of Suleyman a&amp;bil's intimacy with Amir Feyssl, from whom this information might have been picked up. The information might, on the other hand, though less probably, it seems to me, heve been gleaned in Syria, whence Suleyman Gabil has recently returned from a four months’ stay. Yours ever, (Sgci.)

Laithwaite, Esq., India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l.Dear Warner, .i enclose herewith a brief note of a talk X had recently with Jansen, who was sent on to me by Parrer, regarding the possibility ol an oil concession in Asir* On the receipt of Foreign Office printed letter jZ/Xf of the 15th July, 1933 (E. 3804/487/26), I wrote to Cadman who informed me that arrangements had been made for Longrigg to see Fuad as Ryan suggested* But I gather irom a recent inquiry I made of Fraser that nothing very definite has happened up to the present* I was careful not to give Jansen any indication of what line H.M. Government might take if we were asked to support the Eastern A General Syndicate. He merely seemed anxious to keep himself right with u% by letting us know what is going on* C. F* A. Varner, Foreign Office, Downing Street, S # 4 1 • F.sq:I .aay mention, although I did not record it in the A notC' of the interview, that Jane«n appeared to wish to justify the Syndicate in what they had done in regard to Bahrein and the other Gulf areas where at one time they held some kind of coneeaeions. He stated that they had done what they could to interest the Anglo-Pereian Oil Company, and said that at one period (about 1925) the Anglo-Persian Oil Company had taken an option from the Syndicate in regard to certain of the areas. He inquired whether I would be interested to have a prfecis of the correspondence, etc. I replied that if he cared to send it to me I would put it on record. Subsequently he rang me up to say that he had found on reference to his files that the Angl^-Persian Oil Company had not in fact entered into any definite arrangement, which is what I understood to be the case. He again offered to send me a note, and I thanked him. But nothing has so far reached me. This is to sorae extent wrapped up with the activities of the Arabian Development Syndicate in the Neutral Zone, and— —z &lt;g&gt; -* 3- one of these days we may have to let Ryan have our views on the Eastern A General Syndicate and their friends in relation to their activities in Saudi Arabia. I merely pass this information on now for your own use, and am sending copies of this letter to Laithwaite and Seal. Yours sincerely, 8a. :Note of Interview Mr* E* W. Jansen, of the Eastern * General Syndicate, had an interview with Ur* Starling on fray 18th, 1954, and said that the Syndicate were taking an interest in the question of obtaining oil concessions on the yestem side of Arabia and had been told by Ibn Saud that he would be preoared to grant the Syndicate a concession in respect of Asir* He believed that the Standard Oil of California were also interesting themselves in the matter, and unless something was done quickly by a British Company, the Standard Company was likely to take up this concession* He had seen the questions raised in Parliament recently about Bahrein, and it might be inferred from these that the Syndicate was in some way responsible for that concession going to the Americans* He thought, therefore, that he ought to let the Petroleum Denartment know about the Asir proposition. MI** Starling said that Ibn Baud's territory was in a different position from that of the Sheikhdoms on the Eastern coast of Arabia, where the British Government had to be consulted in connection with the grant of concessions. The British Government were naturally desirous that British oil companies should take up oil concessions wherever prospects seemed at all favourable, but frr. Starling said that he could not do more than take note of what r. Jansen had told him.Minute Paper. Department. (3) The Farsan Islands and Asir Interert in these Islands and/or the mainland of ’“sir, from the point of view of petroleum potentialities, seems to date from before the Great iar. Operations were actually started on one of the islands by the Red Sea Petroleum Company, a subsidiary of the Shell Group in 1926 or early in 1927, but drilling operations were subsequently abandoned as unsuccessful. (7) Farsan Islands« now also a part of Saudi Arabia . K.G.S* would appear to have obtained some sort of a concession for the Farsans (and possibly the mainland of Asir) from Hasan al-Idrisi in 1926. It is not clear what became of this concession, if the grant was coraplete, but it was superseded by a concession for the Farsans given by the Idrisi on September 25th, 1926, to a Mr. Cooper, who marketed it to the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company (Foyal Dutch Ghell Group). The latter formed the Red Gea Petroleum Company to work it. This company started operations of some importance at Zifaf Island. The Idrisi, acting it was thought at the time, under Italian influence, but more probably under that of Ibn Saud, made difficulties in the summer of 1927. After abortive efforts by the Company to overcome them, Ibn Saud came forward ostensibly in the role of honest broker between the Idrisi* now his vassal, and the Company. A conference held atWizan in December, 1927, under his auspices between representatives of the Company and the Idriei was again abortive. Ibn Saud eventually intimated ”a decision in y l\sQ t1712n 5000 3/33 (T Minute Paper. Department.

He &amp; ^88 e 'Stec that the Company should send a reDresentative to dedoa^to negotiate the revised concession. On his persisting in this attitude the Company decided to withdraw from the Islands and in September, 1928, th^y r^oved all material under the auspices of 'Dahlia**. It must be assumed that this terminated any rigirre under the Cooper concession. The Shell Company has recently stated that it is not interested to reopen operations in the Farsan Islands. (2^ A sir. Ibn Baud in June, 1925, intimated that he would be prepared to consider offers for a concession xrom ritish Companies. The matter was referred by the Petroleum Department to the I.P.C. within whose sphere of influence heir fell and who were the only company with any British interests who were likely to be prepared, to consider the matter. The I.P.C. have intimated t at they are prepared to send out geologists to mace an examination if they can secure the necessary rights withpayment during the exploratory period. (6) Farsan Islands.

The Farsan Islands have been investigated by the Shell Group (Fed Sea Petroleum Company), who at one time obtained a concession there and super seded the Eastern and General Syndicate. The Shell Company drilled without success and abandoned operations in 1930. A reply has now been received from the Shell stating that they are not interested in the matter. The Anglo-Persian Oil Compan.. have replied that th- 3 ; are not interested in any concession over the Farsan Islands and they understand that the question of a potential concession in Asir will shortly be considered by the Iraq Petroleum company# The Iraq Petroleum Company have intimated that they would like to have an opportunity of considering the matter in so far as Asir is concerned, and a reply has been received from them stating that, on account of the various issues involved, they regret that It is not possible to send an early reply as requested.

King has been approached in this connexion by an Italian group. Faithful to his constant policy of collaboration with His Majesty’s Government which was reaffirmed by Saudi Mission last year he would prefer to deal with British interests. He asks whether any British group would interest it self in Asir and Farsan Islands. Scheme is urgent and he requests very early reply. Fuad said that Italians were acting through an intermediary in Egypt. In reply to question by me he said there was no present activity in connexion with oil in North Hedjaz.[This Document is the Pr operty of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should be returned to the Foreign Office if not required for official use.] Representative of I 0 PoCe left at a moment's notice for London on May 24th.
