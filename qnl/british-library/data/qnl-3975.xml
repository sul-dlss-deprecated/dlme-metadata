I MUCH regret to Lave to report that the recent progress of the negotiations for the purchase of the islands in the Persian Gulf off Bunder Abbas have been most unsatisfactory in their results, which is especially disheartening seeing that the proposal, when first submitted to the late Minister for Foreign Affairs, Yossuk-ed- Dowleh, to the present Prime Minister, Mustaufi-ul-Mamalek, and to the present Minister for Foreign Affairs, Ala-es-Sultaneh, appeared to meet with a much more favourable reception than I had anticipated would be the case. Upon receipt of your telegram No. 252 of the 7th ultimo, I presented a memorandum in French to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, of which I have the honour to enclose a copy, setting forth the very favourable conditions upon which His Majesty’s Government was prepared to negotiate for the purchase of the said islands. Nothing in the manner in which Ala-es-Sultaneh received the memorandum led me to suppose that there was any change in his Highness’s attitude towards the proposal, and I was promised an early answer, for which I pressed in consequence of fhe urgent nature of certain financial arrangements which the Persian Government found itself called upon to make in order to avoid a disaster. No answer having been returned to the memorandum, I sought an interview with the. Prime Minister, at which 1 requested the presence also of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Finance, for the purpose of examining the financial situation with a view to seeing whether or not the gendarmerie could be maintained ; in order to discuss the proposal made by the Persian Government respecting the revenues of the southern customs and a new advance from the British and Russian Governments, which forms the subject of an accompanying despatch; and to ascertain definitely the views of the Cabinet respecting the sale of the islands. 1 pointed out that you, Sir, could not fail to be disappointed, if not seriously annoyed, at the attitude adopted by the Government in ignoring our proposal to provide money in return for something tangible in the place of the usual shadowy promises that have been accepted in the past, and in -making instead a most unreason able proposal without, on this occasion, even attempting to hint at any security for the suggested advance. As it was evident that the Minister of Finance was at the back of the group in the Cabinet that is hostile to the purchase proposal, I turned my attention more especially to that notoriously corrupt official, and told him in very plain language that as long as a Minister of his calibre remained at the head of the financial administration, Persia need not expect that any money would be forthcoming from either Great Britain or Russia. I let Mohtesham-es-Sultaneh know clearly that I am. fully conversant with the intrigues of himself and his secretary-general, by means of which they hope to sow discord among their Belgian employes and so to get a larger control of the finances of the country into their own hands, the road from which to their pockets is a short one. I then turned to the Prime Minister and told his Highness that I could not submit this fresh unreasonable proposal for financial assistance to you, Sir, unless I could add at the same time that the Cabinet was considering in a favourable spirit the proposal I had submitted for the purchase of the islands. Mustaufi-ul-Mamalek, after some hesitation, which was not unnatural seeing that the proposal had previously been well entertained by him, said that the scheme was one that was of such vital importance to Persia, since it concerned the sale of a portion of her territory, that the Government could not deal with it without the presence of the Medjliss, which would meet in a very short time. I then pressed the Prime Minister to give me an assurance that the measure would be laid before the Medjliss as soon as it assembled and would receive the strong support of the Cabinet. Mustaufi-ul-Mamalek would not commit himself to this, and said that he must consult his colleagues, two of the most important of whom were [2318 o—4]r r . ■*&lt; J y lis (el 4 ) Enclosure 2 in No. 1.

For this object the iersian Government were obliged to undertake heavy expenses in despatching lorces to different parts of the country. His Excellency is also well acquainted with the o lei difficulties which the Persian Government had to meet. When the 1 ersian Government were free of these difficulties, they tried to put the security of the country on a him basis. The gendarmerie was created and a large sum of money was spent tor that purpose. The good result of the gendarmerie cannot be denied. Secondly the grave commercial crisis in Persia is due to the present var unfortunately’ raging in Europe. This has greatly affected the Customs revenues one of the important resources of the country, and it is feared that the Government may not be able to meet its liabilities out of the Customs revenues, which are the security for the recent loans and advances. In view^ of these facts, the attention ot the British Minister was drawn, in the note above mentioned, to the financial crisis, l is E xcellency no doubt concurs with me that the contents of his memorandum must have surprised and grieved the Persian Government. The Minister for Foreign Affairs feels sure that the British Government, who have on more difficult occasions given their sincere support to Persia, would not take advantage of the Persian financial difficulties and make such proposals which the Persian Government would be unable to accept, and, if accepted, would bring her face to face with a more serious crisis. It is true that after the opening of the Medjliss the Government is obliged, with the approval of the Chamber, to find new r resources to meet the budget deficiencies as well as the necessary expenses, but for the immediate and necessaiy expenses it looks to His Britannic Majesty’s Government for substantial support. The Ala-es-Sultaneh feels confident that after careful consideration of the difficulties of the Persian Government the British Minister will bring the facts to the notice of his Government, and will not fail to take energetic measures with a view to obtaining the sincere support of the British Government m removing the present crisis in this country.

In reply to the unsigned memorandum of His Excellency the British Minister addressed to the Persian Foreign Office on October 12th the Minister for Foreign Affairs has the honour to refer His Excellency to the various verbal communications recently made respecting the present financial difficulties of the Persian Government. As pointed out by the Foreign Office in its note of October 27th the Persian Government expected the British Minister who is well aware of their present financial difficulties to draw the attention of the British Government to the unsatisfactory condition of the Persian Government and give personal support to the views of the latter. The British Minister is well aware that the present financial straits of the Persian Government are due firstly to the recent years of trouble in the country, the natural result of the change of the old system, and to the expenses incurred in the restoration of order for the good of foreign and internal trade.For this object the Persian Government were obliged to V undertake heavy expenses in despatching forces to differ ent parts of the country. His Excellency is also well acquainted with the other difficulties which the Persian Government had to meet. Vvhen the Persian Government were free of these difficulties, they tried to put the security of the country on a firm basis. The Gendarmerie was created and a large sum of money was spent for that purpose. The good result of the Gendarmerie cannot be denied. Secondly, the grave commercial crisis in Persia is due to the present war unfortunately raging in Europe. This has greatly affected the Customs revenues, one of the important resources of the country, and it is feared that the Government may not be able to meet its liabili ties out of the Customs revenues which are the security for the recent loans and advances. In view of these facts the attention of the British Minister was drawn, in the note above mentioned, to the financial crisis. His Excellency no doubt concurs with me that the contents of his memorandum must have surprised and grieved the Persian Government. The Minister for Foreign Affairs feels sure thatthat the British Government, who have on more difficult occasions given their sincere support to Persia, w&amp;uld not take advantage of the Persian financial difficulties and make such proposals which the Persian Government would he unable to accept and if accepted would bring her face to face with a more serious crisis.

After conversation with Minister for Foreign Affairs on Wednesday I requested to see Ain-ed-Dowleh and the President of the Council together yesterday. We had conversation °of over two hours, at which Minister of Finance was present. I represented that, unless money was at once forthcoming and reliable assurances given forthe future regular payment of gendarmerie, Swedish officers had decided at once to present their resignations. I made a communication m the sense of your above- mentioned telegranp and pointed out that, instead of answering my memorandum embodying the proposals of His Majesty’s Government for the purchase of certain inlands 5 in Persian Gulf, Minister for Foreign Affairs had addressed me officially, asking that all payments on southern customs should be suspended for one year and a joint advance^/3,000,000 tomans (about 500,0001.) should be made to Persia by Great Britain and Russia. A pious hope that things may mend is the only security offered for the future repayment of advance and for resumption of payments due from the sou icr customs.^ ^ at l refuse( j t0 submit such a proposal unless I received some satisfactory assurance that sale of islands would be carried through. President of the Council put ffi S a sentimental pleading on the grounds that Great Britain has always helped Persia, whr, Vioq nnhodv but her to rely on. I refused to listen to such arguments. President of Council then said that question of sale of the islands could not be treated until the Medjliss assembled in a few days, and after much discussion that he would to-morrow lay the question before the Cabinet and let me know i Ministers would undertake to press its conclusion upon the Medjhss as soon as it meets I answered that until I received his reply I would not submit quite unacceptable request for a further advance to your consideration.

M. Mornard has supplied me with a copy of the document he drew up on the spot which I have the honour to transmit to you, Sir, herewith. The proposal to sell portions of the country was acclaimed with horror at first, but I have reason to believe that the idea appears less repugnant at the present moment. Even such flippant politicians as the Persians are beginning to realise that the conditions prevailing to-day are impossible, and that something radical must be done to put the country on a more solid basis than can be achieved by means of short advances or doles, which can even no longer be counted upon for certain. The question naturally arises : What can be done ? A popular outcry against a sale is still too much feared to admit of the immediate adoption of such a drastic method; but the idea is sinking in, and there are thoughtful people who are asking themselves whether Persia could not shake herself free from all her troubles at the cost of the sacrifice. If it were possible to make a bargain with Russia, it would be made to include a public recognition of the fact that foreigners cannot hold or lease landed property in Persia and the withdrawal of all the Russian troops. It may be argued that with the help of the money that Persia would get from such a deal she could both free herself from her more irksome foreign liabilities and still have enough money to carry out herself many urgently needed internal public works, such as short railways that would pay. It is also recognised that the territory it is proposed to alienate in the north has already passed for ever out of Persian control, whilst the southern islands are of little value to Persia, whatever their importance may be to Great Britain. I had previously discussed with M. Mornard the possibility of obtaining money by means of territorial cessions to the neighbouring Powers, but I had no idea that he would submit such a suggestion to the Council of Ministers, and 1 think that he can only have done so at a moment of great irritation when he found himself attacked bitterly for a situation which he had repeatedly warned the Cabinet was inevitable unless serious steps were taken to put a stop to a multitude of abuses. The idea of a loan is not very popular, because much fear is expressed of the powers that the foreign Commission of Control that would be inevitable would demand. A clean sale implying free money is more attractive to many. I have, Ac. WALTER TOWNLEY. Enclosure in No. I. M. Mornard to Kawam-es-Sultaneh. Excellence, Teheran, le 7 juillet, 1914. J’AI I’honneur d’exposer a votre Excellence que depuis plus de trois mois le Tresorier a en quelque sorte suspendu le service des payements, a cause du manque de fonds disponibles. Les payements que le Tresorier a effectues depuis le Nourouz ont ete tres irregu- lierement faits, pour le motif qu’ils etaient subordonnes aux encaissements d’impots tres pen importants a cette epoque de I’annee et aux quelqnes avances de fonds que la Banque Imperiale et la Banque d’Escompte ont bien voulu faire a la Tresorerie. [2251 h —4] v to Imiiu Co j M 16 OCT 1914 j[47400] No- !• Sir U'. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received September 8.) (No. 224. Very Confidential.) gi r Tehran, August 3, 1914. IN my despatch No. 212 of the 25th ultimo, I had the honour to submit to you a copy of a financial statement laid before the Cabinet by the Treasurer-General, in which a suggestion was made that a solution of the present financial embarrassments might be ISund in the sale of certain territories to Great Britain and Russia respectively. . , I was surprised, in the course of a long conversation which 1 had on the 26th ultimo with the Prime Minister, to see that the suggestion put forward by M. Mornard has had a favourable reception in Ministerial circles. _ Ala-us-Sultaneh explained that people are in despair, and are so heartily sick of the situation that has been created by Russia’s steady encroachments upon Persia’s prerogatives that they are prepared to jump at any solution, however heroic, that might offer a chance of reaching a clear understanding. His Highness said that the manner in which Russia has laid hands upon the collection of revenue in the north from her subjects and protected persons, who are becoming countless, and is insidiously taking possession of the administration of the country through her consuls, has become so intolerable that he believes that a Medjliss would welcome even such a drastic solution as a sale of territory, provided that such conditions were attached to such a sale as would safeguard Persia from a continuance of Russian intervention in her internal affairs, and would guarantee her liberty of action in her own house. I would respectfully venture to submit that the scheme appears to me to offer a possible solution of the Persian question, which, without some such radical step which will clearly define the true position and intentions of all parties, seems to me destined, sooner or later, to lead to serious differences between the British and Russian Govern ments. It may injustice be said that the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907, in so far as it concerned Persia, has done a great work. It lias undoubtedly preserved Persia from total disruption, but it has done its work, and if persevered in, will eventually prove a failure. If it be granted that both Governments were genuinely imbued with a desire to maintain the integrity and independence of Persia at the time of the signature of the convention, it cannot, I think, be gainsaid that circumstances have caused Russia to in a measure, at least, overlook the underlying principle of the convention, and that the recent action of the Russian legation and consuls has been of a nature to endanger the continued existence of Persia as a sovereign independent kingdom. As co-signatory of the convention of 1907, Great Britain would appear bound to use her best endeavours to remind Russia of her undertaking under the said convention ; but constant reminders of this nature are likely to produce friction, and it may, perhaps, be rightly held that the protection of Persia’s rights under the joint guarantee of the two Governments is not of sufficient importance to risk jeopardising the good relations which it is of the first importance to maintain. There is, however, another side to the picture which cannot be lost sight of: the steady encroachment of Russia by means of the leasing of properties, and the intervention of Russian consuls which that entails, is rapidly spreading southwards from Ispahan into the neutral zone, in which, under the letter of the convention, Russia has equal rights with ourselves. It would appear to me inevitable that some day —and that day is not far distant at the present rate of progress—Russian interests will clash with old-established British rights in South Persia, and a quarrel may ensue. Already, I understand, at Ispahan the British and Russian residents pass each other as strangers. Under such conditions, would it not, I venture to suggest, be well to take under careful consideration the question whether or no the scheme of zones of influence has been proved sufficiently successful to justify its continued maintenance ? It appears to me to threaten to-day dangerous complications. Russia’s aspirations in the north have been so far satisfied that either she or zealous consuls who are seeking their own self- advancement are looking for fresh fields in which to make her influence felt. It is hard [2251 h —9] ’ -i n MM2 to see how this tendency can be checked, unless the zones are delimitated afresh m such a manner as to give almost the entire neutral zone to Great Britain. It is improbable that Russian public opinion would accept such an arrangement Were the Persian Government to propose to the two Powers a sale ol certain territories as sketched in M. Mornard’s memorandum a condition would doubtless be attached that the system of zones should be abolished, in order that Persia might have \ complete liberty of action in what remained to her, all due assurances being ot course given for the proper protection of the British and Russian interests already established. I am of opinion that such an arrangement would be greatly to our advantage as things stand to-day. We could easily make our own terms to protect our various interests and we should no longer feel that the steady ^ Russian pressure from the north is ieopardising our rights which under the convention are very vulnerable. Our position in the Gulf would be rendered unassailable by our possession of the islands, quite apart from the possible future value they may have as oil-producing units or for purposes of storage. . . . J -x- i • j I presume that His Majesty's Government are of opinion that Biitish interests aio best served by a Persia sufficiently strong to act as a buffer between Great Britain and Russia in the Middle East. Such a Persia can never, it has been clearly demonstrated, be created under the'Id07 convention. Half the country is directly under Russian influence, a portion is undecided, and the insignificant remainder from the point of view of Tehran politics, owns British allegiance. Meanwhile, the Central Government has no authority and never can have any authority so long as its hands are tied by the necessity of considering the wishes of one or other Power, or of both. A frank protectorate would afford the country a better chance of making progress than the present most unsatisfactory system. __ ^ ^ j i e If Russian aspirations in Azerbaijan or elsewhere could be satisfied by a sale of territory, Persia could be rendered free to look after her own affairs; she would have money with which to pay her most pressing creditors, and she would ^ still have money over with which to carry out public works and maintain a sufficient force to guarantee law and order. Given a chance to manage their own affairs themselves, there are plenty of men in Persia to-day capable of doing so, and I feel convinced that, if she were given a fair start, Persia could not only rise again, but she could become a much more 'enlightened and useful State than she has ever been before. The position at Ispahan could be settled with a stroke of the pen. If the arrangement made between the Zil-es-Sultan and the manager of the Russian Bank were cancelled, the situation would become normal again as far as the interference ot the Russian consul-general in the administration of the province is concerned. This question of Ispahan is one that is likely to be fruitful ot much trouble for our interests if the Russians are to be.allowed to maintain the paramount position they have acquired there. The Bakhtiaris are closely identified with Ispahan. For the last four or five years the Governor-General has been a Bakhtiari. Should a Russian nominee, other than a Bakhtiari, be appointed, it is more than probable that the chiefs of this fickle and monev-loving tribe would make up their minds to come to terms with the Russians much in the same way as the Zil-es-Sultan has done. All Persians are prone to side with the stronger, more especially if pecuniary advantage is likely to result therefrom. We have seen from recent reports from Ispahan that there is good reason to believe that the present Russian consul-general, inspired doubtless by the manager of the bank, who knows the local conditions thoroughly, has made overtures to the Bakhtiaris through the representative at Ispahan ot the Haji ilkhani family, whose hdelitv to British interests is perhaps kss well assured than that of the ilkhani family. At the same time certain of the khans residing at Tehran have warned me that, if it is seen that the British Government means to abandon Ispahan to the Russians, we shall lose their allegiance. This would mean that the important Ahwaz—Ispahan trade route would pass under a foreign influence inimical to the penetration of British commerce into Central Persia, and that a hostile wedge would be driven down into Arabistan. We should, moreover, lose an invaluable link in the chain of that rampart of protection by local levies which seems to me essential fur the protection of the British oil interests now established along the Gulf littoral. Ever since I have been at Tehran 1 have been at great pains to maintain the cordial relations I found existing between this legation and the Bakhtiari khans. I think that I have had some measure of personal success, but I feel that the position is ephemeral and that for that rea c on it is most desirable that some means should be found of forging a stronger and more durable chain binding together our own and Bakhtiari interests, Much might be done by the presence of British officers asadvisers among the Bakhtiars, but it is probable that such a step would arouse resent ment at St. Petersburgh, more especially if, as would appear to be the case from the policy of the ftussian consul-general, reported from Ispahan, it is intended to endeavour to alienate the khans from their tacit allegiance to us. Again, the situation that must be created in Luristan, if the British railway enterprise, to which His Majesty's Government and that ot India appeal to attach^ great importance, is to be carried through successfully, may well be productive of friction between Great Britain and llussia in the future. In order to succeed, not only in the execution of that undertaking but in its subsequent smooth working, it will be essential to create a pro-British atmosphere. A start has already been made in that direction by enlisting the sympathies of the Yali of Pusht-i-Kuh, but there is small doubt that the Russians are watching developments, and are likely to favour any move that may be calculated to render the railway scheme abortive, This was clearly evident when Nizam-us-Sultaneh was in Tehran. Fur the above reasons, and for others of a more remote nature that will only mature if our aims in Luristan and Bakhtiaristan are frustrated, it would appear to me highly desirable that a limit should be set to Russian penetration into the neutral zone.^ A^total abolition of the same could, in my opinion, only be effected at a_ sacrifice of interests of great value to us, and would also entail the eventual partition of the Kingdom. Under the purchase scheme, if Russia could be induced to boy under certain essential conditions what she has already acquired, Russian penetration south might be effectively checked. It is possible that the best means of inducing Russia to adopt the idea of purchase would be for His Majesty’s Government to carry through the purchase cf the islands m the Gulf first. Russia would then piobabl} demand a quid pro quo in the north, and the desired result would have been achieved. ^ It may possibly seem that the procedure suggested has a “ tricky appearance among friends, but I would venture to point out that despite reiterated assurances, Russia’s policy in Persia, more especially in the matter of the Ispahan arrangement and Kermanshah, has not been marked with whole-hearted sincerity towards a friend who has loyally carried carried out the terms of the bargain made in 190/. It is of course by no means certain that any Persian statesman would be found sufficiently courageous to take a step which would involve the alienation of a portion of the national territory, but the brusqueness of recent Russian action has awakened the semi-somnolent Persian to a realisation of the fact that certain parts of what is y ti 1 called Persia have already passed into Russian hands never to be returned, and thap if a halt is not called to the present insidious policy of grab on Russia’s part, Great Britain, whom the majority of Persians still look upon as a friend, whose good intentions towards Persia are inspired by the greatest ot incentives, self-interest, will find herself forced in sheer self-defence to adopt a similar policy, in order to preserve her interests and position. Nothing can stop the development of what is in full swing to-day but the adoption of a scheme which would not only enable Persia to treat for freedom m the manao-ement of her own affairs, but would also put her in possession of funds with which to put her house in order and make a start upon a programme of public works which will immensely improve the economic situation of the country. I have, &amp;c.

No. 57745 regarding the possibility that the Per sian Government may be unable to meet the November coupon of the public loan of Idll. The Marquess of Crewe agrees that, *j the easons given by the Imperial Bank, it is very desirable to avert this contingency; and though as a separate trans action the proposal that H.M.G. should make good, any deficit would doubtless be open to objection, he would be prepared to agree to it as part oj the scheme Jor purchasing the islands. If, as seems likely, the Per sian Government shovj a disposition to bargain over the offer made in Sir E. Grey's telegram No.252 of the 5th inst. to H.M. Minister, Tehran, His Lordship would suggest that before inc reusing it by the proposal of an annuity, N.M.Government should offer to make them selves responsible for finding the balance of the November coupon. The sum, though not large in itself, is worth considerably more than its cash value to the Persian Government if it saves their credit. At the sarnie time the fact that by selling the islands in the man ner proposed any fiture difficulty in meeting the coupons will be diminished -- since all prior charges on the Southern Customs will be removed -- might he used as an argument to induce the Persian Government to The Under Secretary of State, close FOREIGN OFFICE.I am to close with the offer. If Sir E. Grey approves this course, suggest that Sir W. Townley should he instructed to proceed with the least possible delay* Lord Crewe is disposed to think that it would he well to earn, the Imperial Bank confidentially of the proposal to cancel the Persian debts to H.M. Government and the Government of India, as it may considerably affect their arrangements.

(September 25, 9*30 p.m.) I COMMUNICATED to Minister for Foreign Affairs yesterday the contents of your telegram No. 231 of 22nd September. His Highness, who, in spite of reiterated warnings, has always assured both the last and the present Cabinets that His Majesty’s Government would never desert Persia in her hour of dire financial need, was prostrated. He said that the Cabinet must resign, and that no one would be found to take their places. His Highness considered that sale of Crown jewels would be insufficient to-day, as they could not be sent abroad, and probably no purchaser would be forthcoming. He said that he would talk over the question of the islands with Cabinet, and seemed to think it a possible way of raising money if the British offers were made more attractive than that submitted to his predecessor, but said that it would have to be sanctioned by the Medjliss. . Prime Minister, to whom I spoke on the subject some days ago, replied in the same sense. Road robberies on a larger scale are recommencing, and, if disorders ensue upon the disbandment of the gendarmerie, it is probable that Russian troops will have to be called in to preserve peace. At the same time it is impossible to recommend upon economic grounds that more money should be lent, and I cannot conscientiously say that I feel sure that if lent it would not be wasted. . . . Conditions attached to loan of 300,000 tomans, to which allusion is made ^ m Petrograd telegram No. 437 of 22nd September, entail Persian Government taking over a debt of 2,000,000 tomans due to Russian Bank.

ADMIRALTY, July 16th, 1914. Sir:- In reply to your communication of the 7th instant, no.30268, relative to the proposed lease of islands in the Persian Gulf, I am comanded by My Lords Commission ers of the Admiralty to request you to inform the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that in their opinion it is most important, in view of the recent discussions concerning the agreement with the Anglo- Persian Oil Company, that the lease of these islands should be secured. My Lords would not feel justified at the present time in committing themselves to a definite limit for the rent to be offered for such a lease. It may however be material to remark that the latest geological reports are very favourable, and that boring plant has been sent to Kishim for testing the various sites for oil. I am to add that My Lords concur in the reply which Sir The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office.Sir E. Grey proposes to give to Messrs. Strick respect ing their proposed application for a concession (your letter of the 8th instant No.29499) but they observe that the firm's proposal appears to relate to mineral rights on the mainland as well as on the islands. I am, &amp;c., (Signed) 0. Murray./ 2nd Sept. 1914. Dear Oliphant, i l I enclose two copies of a memorandum on nossible methods of purchasing or leasing the JL Persian Gulf islands.

If it should be decided to 'purchase the full ownership and sovereignty of the islands, and this cannot be acquired for less than 2,000,000L, the Government of India are prepared to share in the cost. (2,000,000L down would be equivalent at 4 per cent, compound interest to an annuity of about 82,000L a year for 99 years).

But since, of the outstanding claims on Persia, a sum of 296,478?. represents a loan (plus interest charges) made by India alone, the Treasury should pay half that sum (148,239?.) to us before the remainder of the purchase price is divided.

An alternative form of purchase would be as follows :— (1) England and India to pay down, between them, 300,000?. (2) Persia’s debts to India and England, amounting to about 790,000?., to be cancelled. (3) England and India to pay Persia an annuity of x pounds sterling for 99 years, the first payment to take place 12 months after the payment of the 300,000?. (4) In view of the fact that about 296,500?. of the outstanding loans to Persia has been advanced by the Government of India alone, it would be necessary to make a special adjustment with the Foreign Office to equalise matters. This could be done either by the Foreign Office paying practically the whole of the lump sum payment of 300,000?., or by the Foreign Office bearing a larger share than India of the annuity. - 1,209,814 0 0—WM. ■■■■ih i The annuity to Ijg GntGred. in (3) would depend, on ulietliei pnicliase basis is 2,000,000Z. gross or something less.

If the gross sum were less—for instance, 1,836,390/.—the annuity, on the same interest basis, would be approximately 30,480?. If it weie 1,500,000/. the annuity would be approximately 16, &lt;40/. Scheme II.—Various forms of lease. 1. The Government of India are prepared to share in a lease for 99 years at an annual rental of 100,000/., cost to be equally divided between India Office and Treasury. Three years’rent (300,000/.), would be advanced m equal shares by the Indian and Imperial Governments. I he Government of India do not combine with this proposal any suggestion for the extinction of Persia’s existing debts to the Indian and Imperial Governments. Put a calculation has since been made that if Persia s existing debts were cancelled and an advance of 300,000/. made, a reduction of the rental from 100,000/. to about 55,450/. a vear could be claimed in return for these concessions. Of this the Treasury would pay about 30,500/. and the India Office about 24,500/. But the Treasury might pay in some other way their share of India’s separate loan (296,478/.), which figures in the debts to be extinguished. 2. If a rental of 100,000/. is thought excessive, the Persian Government might be prepared to accept 50,000/. a year^ for a 99 years’ lease on condition of receiving an advance of six years’ rent (300,000/.). It would hardly be practicable to combine this with any proposal for the extinction of Persia’s debts, as the rental left to be paid after such concessions would be only about 5,475/. a year. 3. If this offer is thought too low, 75,000/. a year might be offered for a 99 years’ lease, with advance of four years’ rent (300,000/.). Hie offer in a modified form might include the extinction of existing debt and an advance of 300,000/. A calculation has been made that in that case a rental of about 34,470/. would remain payable. The Treasury might adjust their share of India’s separate loan (296,478/.) either (a) by finding practically the whole of the advance of 300,000/., i.e., half the advance = 150,000/. — half the separate loan - 148,239/.; or (6) by bearing a larger share than India of the remaining rental of 30,000/. rCclorhfl Knox to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received July 30, 5'40 p.m.) Bushire, July 30. 1914.

I am greatly inclined to favour proposal, hut I regret the omission of Hormuz. If it is not possible to include Hormuz, I would suggest a clause in lease ensuring that if ?U? will not be leased to any other power and that/mining or other concession relating to Hormuz he given without our consent which should he previously obtained. In my opinion the greatest importance attaches to closing line of paragraph one of Tehran telegram No.10 7 , by which I understand exclusion during period for ^hich lease is given of all administrative control by Persian Government including customs. With reference to terms of lease, I am of opinion that it should be granted for 99 years at rent of 100,000 pounds a year. Should an objection be put forward the rent, though high, was insufficient for present needs of Persian Government, I submit that Persia could raise loan of two million on security of rent which amount should enable her to tide over the two-year period, vide Toymlev’s despatch No.238, dated October 29th, 1913, addressed to Foreign Office, London.

SECRETARY Sir Edward Grey has for some time been engaged in strong- representations to the Persian Government that they should cancel an extensive mining concession on the mainland and islands in the vicinity of Bunder Abbas, at present irregularly held by the Moin-ut-lujjar, an exceeding!} wealthy 1 eisian, w 10 in the past has been a bitter opponent of British interests in the Persian Gulf. It is unnecessary to explain the details of this long and complicated question, beyond observing that the Moin’s wealth gives him great influence with the individual members of the Persian Government, while on the other hand Sir E. Grey would be reluctant to use active pressure to secure acceptance of the demands of His Majesty s Government, fully justified though he believes them to be. ^ A possible solution has, however, been mooted by the Persian Minister loi roreign Affairs, namely, that certain of the islands should be leased by the Persian Government to His Majesty’s Government for a term of years, and I am directed to transmit to you herewith, to be laid before the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty s treasury, paraphrases of telegrams from His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, and of letters from the India Office and Admiralty on the subject.* . The correspondence shows that there is a consensus of opinion in tavour ot renting the islands not only on commercial grounds, but more especially m view of the grave political and strategical considerations involved. The Government of India have expressed the opinion—which the Marquess ot Crewe shares—that the acquisition of the five islands on lease for 25,000L per annum would be reasonable, and that it would be worth the payment of even oU,UUUb il necessary ; and the Secretary of State for India in Council is prepared to accept half the annual rent as a charge on Indian revenues. , ., The Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, moreover, considei that the oif royalties and other revenues derivable from the islands would in all piobability alone suffice to cover the whole outlay on rent. i , -r In view of these facts, and having regard to the probability that if the lersian Government become aware of the potentiality of oil exploitation on Ivishm island the price would at once be raised, Sir E Grey has instructed Sir W. Townley m a telegram, of which a copy is enclosed herein,! to open discussions with the Persian Government on the subject. . . „ , T • i I am in these circumstances to express the hope that, m view ot the Imperial interests involved and the favourable opportunity offered, their Lordships will sanction as a charge on Imperial funds the expenditure required to meet a moiety of the rent which it may be necessary to pay for the lease of the islands up to a maximum ot 50,000Z per annum. # ^ £ t In view of the urgency of the question, I am to request the favour of an early reply.

I am to say that Lord Crewe finds it difficult to suggest a maximum figure for the terms to be offered to the Persian Government for a long lease of the islands. The dominant consideration is their strategical value for naval and military purposes, and the most competent judge of this value is the Admiralty, who have now a direct interest in the islands on account of their potential oil resources and by reason of the recently concluded arrangement with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. If Sir Edward Grey sees no objection on grounds of general policy to acquiring territorial rights in the Persian Gulf, and the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury will consent to increase, if necessary, the amount to be offered by His Majesty’s Government as annual rent to the Persian Government to 50,000L or even to 75,COOL, Lord Crewe will advise his Council to sanction a contribution from Indian revenues of a moiety of the sum actually agreed on. It is understood that if oil is raised in the islands by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, royalty would be payable to His Majesty’s Government as lessee instead of to the Persian Government, and that the Indian Government, if a all such receipts. The Persian Government should be able to raise a large loan, possible as much as 1,000,000Z. on the security of an annual rent of 50,000Z. for ninety-nine years. It might ISLANDS in Persian Gulf. With reference to paragraph 7 of my telegram of 22nd ultimo, a fresh investigation has been made confidentially, from which it appears, as reported by the Resident, Bushire, that the estimated net annual profit which the Muin formerly derived from his original concession, granted in 1904, works out approximately at 20,000Z.

His Excellency’s face fell, and he exclaimed that this would mean little more than the islands produce at present, and that he believed that an offer of 1,000,0006. to buy Hormuz alone from a British syndicate had already been refused. I replied that the syndicate would have lost money, since I understood that oxide mines only produced about 11,0006. a year, of which 75 per cent, goes to the Persian Government, and that the supply is probably not inexhaustible. n It is not clear from the telegram from Governnment of India what value is placed on the islands, but it appears to me evident that nothing under 100,0006. per annum would tempt the Persian Government.

All are agreed that no new proposals shall be discussed before the coronation. I do not think that a proposal based upon commercial considerations would^meet with any approval. Such a scheme as the one suggested could only succeed if the Government could thereby see a way to raising a large sum of money, at least 1,000,0001., upon the security of the rent paid by His Majesty’s Government. Any attempt to add other conditions would certainly jeopardize the negotiations.

I did not know, I added, if the money would be forthcoming even under such conditions. Minister for Foreign Affairs then asked whether I had had any reply about the question of leasing the islands in the Gulf. I replied in the affirmative, and said that the most His Majesty’s Government could offer would be 25,0001. for Kishm, Henjam, Larak, Hormuz, and Sheeshuaib. His Excellency’s face fell, and he exclaimed that this would mean little more than the islands produce at present, and that he believed that an offer of 1,000,000L to buy Hormuz alone from a British syndicate had already been refused. I replied that the syndicate would have lost money, since I understood that oxide mines only produced about 11,000£. a year, of which 75 per cent, goes to the Persian Government, and that the supply is probably not inexhaustible. It is not clear from the telegram from Governnment of India what value is placed on the islands, but it appears to me evident that nothing under 100,000Z. per annum would tempt the Persian Government. Minister for Foreign Affairs said he would submit the matter to his colleagues, but felt convinced that the proposal would not be listened to. He seemed to be [? very] disappointed.

If the Swedish Government persist in their intention to recall the military mission lent to Persia for the purpose of organising a gendarmerie, we shall find ourselves here in a precarious and almost desperate situation at a moment when the young Shah is about to ascend the throne. I had yesterday most satisfactory proofs that the Shah and some of the more enlightened of his entourage are fully conscious of the onerous duties which await His Majesty, and that he and his younger advisers, amongst the ablest of whom is a son of the late Mozaffereddin Shah, have been discussing seriously and intelligently the qualities of the various public men best suited to form a Cabinet after the Coronation. I was not aware till yesterday that the Shah was taking such a serious interest in the future of his country. Persons who have been brought into contact with him lately, including my wife on her return from Europe, have been struck with the marked advance m him from a fat shy boy to a thinking youth. He also now speaks French fluently, and does not require the services of an interpreter. I gathered that Shah does not mean to be swayed by the advice of men like Kamran Mirza and the old reactionary party. It w~ould be hard if a boy sovereign who shows promise should be confronted by such a situation as would be created by the withdrawal of the Swedes. Who, and what, is to take their place, and how are the 7,000 gendarmes who would be left without officers to be controlled ? British officers would certainly be as distasteful to Persia as Russians, and, I am convinced, that they could only be imposed on Persia by some drastic measure such as an ultimatum or a bribe in the shape of money to finance the administration. Treasurer- General has often told me that he would go if the Swedes do, as his administration could no more w r ork with British officers than with Russians. I would beg once more to place on record my firm conviction that the Swedes can yet succeed if a fair chance is given them, and if they are genuinely supported. They have faults but they have done good yeoman work. All impartial persons capable of judging the situation are unanimous in their praise of the result achieved when viewed as a whole. The only alternative, unless it is proposed to let Persia again make a trial of governing herself by her old methods, is British officers in the south and Russians in the north. Such an arrangement would lead to partition in some form which in addition to many other drawbacks would eventually prove much more costly to British taxpayer than a few hundred thousand pounds advanced to Persia at a remunerative rate of interest.Immediate and C+ijidential.

The first four of these islands are situated off the coast of Persia in the deep indentation between long. 55° and 57° opposite the Musandim promontory of Oman. The island of Kishm is 68 miles in length and varies between 10 and 20 miles in breadth. It has a population of over 12,000, nearly all Arabs from Trucial Oman. Several shows of oil occur there which *- Admiral Slade believes to be of great value'; other wise the island has no economic importance, though date cultivation would doubtless be extended if it were properly administered. At the N.W. extremity is the British station of Basidu, now practically disused, except for the purpose of flying the British flag. Hen,jam lies to the S. of Kishm. It is 5i miles in length and 2 in breadth, and has an Arab popula tion of a few hundreds. It has no economic value; but on it His Majesty’s Government hold a telegraph concession, where wireless telegraphy will shortly be installed, and a coaling station has recently been established there. It possesses a valuable anchorage and is much used by native vessels. Larak lies to the E. of Kishm, 20 miles S.E. of Bunder Abbas. It has 200 inhabitants, and is of no economic value. Hormuz lies to the N.E, of Kishm, 11 miles E.B.K. of Bunder Abbas. It is absolutely barren, but Y909. 1.517. lOOO.—3/1910. [724/09.] haS . - „ — . -has valuable deposits of red oxide, at present worked for the Persian Government by the Muin-ut-Tujjar, under an agreement for 10 years from 22nd tiarch 1910. The group of islands taken together are, polit ically and strategically, the key to the I ersian Gulf They command Bunder Abbas which His Majesty’s Govern ment have laid down must be the point at which the Trans-Persian railway mMHiiiiiiMi touches the sea; and between them they form the best -if not the only- anchorage for men- of-war near the mouth of the Gulf. The tendency of recent events has been to increase the competition which British supremacy has to face in the Persian Gulf. Hitherto a British mare claus um it is tending to become an international thoroughfare. By the expenditure of large sums on lighting, buoying, and policing its waters; by an agreement with Turkey consolidating our position at Koweit and removing causes of friction on the Arab coast; and by the maintenance of most friendly rela tions with the Sheikh of Mohamrnera, His Majesty’s Government are seeking to secure British supremacy. But the advent of the Bagdad Railway to Basra; the determined and successful efforts of the subsidized Hamburg-Amerika line to secure a footing for German trade; the renewal of its subsidy to a Russian line from Odessa; the revival of interest shown by a French line; and the appearance even of Italy on the scene - all these are indications that our supremacy will not be maintained without effort. The establish ment of British administration on these islands would at once put it beyond reach of probable attack and render the success of such attack a matter of much less importance. Moreover, if anything v/ere to happen to the integrity of Persia, the possession of the islands would be a matter of almost vital concern to us. InIn itself this might be held to be a sufficient return for the expenditure proposed. But there are other advantages. (1) As has been mentioned, the island of Kishm has very promising shows of oil. It is covered by the concession of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in which his Majesty's Government are about to invest £2,200,000. It would add greatly to the value of their holding if important wells were in what would virtually be British territory. Moreover, Sir E. Slade is of opinion that the royalty which would be payable to His Majesty's Govern ment under the concession (16% of the net annual profits) would more than cover the rent. (2) Henjam, under British administration, would probably soon aevelop into the principal depot of our trade in that part of the Gulf - a circumstance which would doubt less tend to increase our trade, and strengthen our relations, with the Trucial coast. (3) Established at the mouth of the Gulf we should be in a much better position to protect the pearl fisheries, and prevent the intrusion of foreign influences and methods. (4) The presence of British administration on the islands would undoubtedly have a tranquillising effect on the Persian mainland opposite. None of these considerations apply to Sheikh Shuaib. We want to build a lighthouse on this island for the convenience of commerce in the Gulf. It is an impor- /iMl. tant link m the chain of light^/, but the Persian Govern ment have refused to allow it except on impossible terms.

Sir, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to forward-with reference to your letter No. 16885 of the 21st April- copy of a tele gram that has been received from the G-ovt. of India regarding the possible acquisition by F.M.G. oj^k a long leabe of the islands of Larak, Henjam, Kishm, Hormuz and Sheikh Shuaib. The importance, for political and strategical reasons, of secur ing the entrance of the Persian Gulf has long been a commonplace of British policy, and it is unnecess ary to elaborate that point. The discovery of oil on an island covered by the concession held by a Company in which H.M.G. have a very large financial interest, and the development of Henjam as the prin cipal depot of British and Indian trade in that part of the Gulf, which would naturally follow if the islands were under British adminis- tration, introduce economic factors of scarcely less importance. On these grounds, therefore, the Marquess of Crewe strongly sup ports the Govt, of India's recora- mendations. He agrees that Sheikh Shaaib and Hormuz should if possible be included in the transaction forreasons given by them, existing rights in the latter island being of course respected. He understands that it is proposed that H.M.G. should take the place of the Persian Govt, as the recipient of royalties in respect of both oil and oxide, and that being so, the terms suggested by the G-ovt. of India appear to him rea sonable, and he would be prepared to admit half the annual rent ac a charge on Indian revenues. He would suggest that Sir W. Townley should have a free hand in negotiating on that basis, within the limits of £12,000 and £B&amp;,000 m the first instance 9 ^ Us fcd /•{ frl.fy. c^fO'OTO f If it were possible also to UlCI/ICCaa^ secure any of the points enumerated in Sir P.

I am to suggest that, if Sir E. Grey approves these proposals, the question should be opened with the Persian Govt., and the transaction completed, with the least possible delay, since it is likely that if they become aware of the potentiality of oil exploitation on Kishm, they will raise their price. ^It is possible that an arrangement, on these lines may be criticised by the Russian Govt. But it does not appear to Lord Irewe that it in any way infringes the integrity of Persia; and. the existence of a Russian cantonment at Gumbad-i-Kabus (for which no rent is paid, so far as His Lord- ship is aware) might be pointed to as a precedent.be brought /'rom Viceroy, '22nd May 1914.

Our reason for recommending inclusion of Sheikh Shuaib Island is merely that its acquisition would enable us to complete our lighting scheme.

WITH reference to your telegram No. 361’ of the 20th November, I have the honour to transmit herewith copy of the Bill conferring on Muin-ut-Tujjar certain rights in connection with the mining of Hormuz oxide. No agreement in accordance with article 8 has as yet been executed between the Ministry of Public Works and the Muin-ut-Tujjar. I understand that Mr. Shuster disputes the validity of the law, principally on account of the absence of his imprimatur to it, which he claims is necessary under the law, defining the attributes of the treasurer-general. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Enclosure in No. 1. Bill passed by the Medjliss at the Sitting of November 2, 1911, in regard to the lease of Hormuz Oxide. (Translation.) ARTICLE 1. The Government hands over to Hajji Muin-ut-Tujjar the mine of oxide of iron which is in the Isle of Hormuz, for ten solar years from the beginning of Hammal It II, 1328 (22nd March, 1910), on the condition that all undertakings which, in accordance with a separate contract, were arrived at on the 16th Zighedeh, 1328 (19th November, 1910), between the previous Cabinet and Mr. Strick should be fully carried out by Hajji Muin-ut-Tujjar during its term, which is five solar years, and that should he act m a manner contrary to the articles of the said contract so as to cause a loss to the Government, he shall have to make good any losses occasioned to the Government. Art. 2. The Government undertakes that from any quantity of soil which may be over and above the 13,000 tons of the oxide of iron now ready belonging to Hajji Muin-ut-Tujjar, which it bought and gave him an order of payment for the sum of 24,0001 to be realised by him as against the value of 11,294 tons of soil, up to the amount of 30,000 tons of soil which in accordance with the contract must be delivered to Mr. Strick, to pay Hajji Muin-ut-Tujjar 15 per cent, for the expenses of excavation, on condition that should the soil now ready belonging to Hajji Muin-ut-Tujjar be less than 13,000 tons he should pay the Government for the deficit up to 13,000 tons at forty-two shillings and a half per ton, and that should the soil now ready be more than 13,000 tons Hajji Muin-ut-Tujjar will not claim the price of the surplus. Art. 3. Hajji Muin-ut-Tujjar, after deducting the 13,000 tons, is bound to pay the Government the remaining cost of the soil purchased by Mr. Strick until the expiration of Mr. Strick’s contract, and in case the appointed instalments should not be met, the Government will be able to revoke this contract. Art. 4. If until the expiration of the Government’s contract with Mr. Strick, which is for the first five years, Hajji Muin-ut-Tujjar should, during this period, sell anything over and above the 30,000 tons to him or to any other body, he will pay 75 per cent, of the cost of the soil to the Government. Art. 5. After the expiration of Mr. Strick’s contract, any quantity of soil which may be excavated from the said isle, 75 per cent, of the cost of the same will be the Government’s share, and 25 per cent, of it will belong to Hajji Muin-ut-Tujjar for the expenses and his commission. Art. 6. All transactions which Hajji Muin-ut-Tujjar may within the period of ten years do with anyone in regard to the red soil of oxide of iion must be with the Government’s information. [2286 5—14] [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government ]2 Art. 7. If within ten years Hajji Muin-ut-Tujjar should excavate and store a greater quantity of soil than can he disposed of by sale, it (the surplus) will belong to the Government. . _ # Art. 8. The necessary agreement will, according to the above articles, be exchanged in duplicate between the Hajji Muin-ut-Tujjar and the Ministry of Public Works. ' The contract for the excavation of the oxide mine on the Isle of Hormuz for a period of ten years, which contains eight articles, was, at the sitting of 10th Zighedeh, which corresponds with the 9th Agrab, 1329 (2nd November, 1911), passed by a majority of thirty-four votes. HUSSEIN, President of the National Consultative Assembly. MO ’ T AM EN - UI^MULK.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic M ajesty's Government.] RECENT Renter telegrams emanating from Tehran and London seem to adumbrate that His Majesty’s Government may be giving lively consideration to the pros and cons of the grant of a further respite to the Persian Government for restoring order on the Bushire-Ispahan road and in Ears generally, and, if this is the case, it can only be in conjunction with an extensive scheme for the financing of the Governor- General by Imperial Government. Without touching on prospects of such a scheme, I venture to urge, in case anything of the sort is on the tapis, the importance of our securing from the Persian Government, in return for such forbearance, the preliminary settlement of various desiderata, regulation of which would assist towards the consolidation of our position and legitimate interests. Immediate loss both in trade and prestige which will be involved to us by further long-suffering is so considerable that it would appear gratuitously quixotic for us to refrain from requiring the Persian Government, as a condition of it, to recompense us as far as they can for the damage their impotence brings on us. Satisfaction of our requirements in these matters involves no difficulty or loss of authority or dignity for the Persian Government, and, moreover, it is not our position vis-a-vis of Persia which we seek to better thereby, but our position vis-d-vis of foreign Powers. To the strengthening of this latter position Persia should be interested little less than ourselves, for she must surely now see in Great Britain a friendly Power whose [? aim] it is to uphold her. Desiderata which occurred to me are as follows :— 1. Documentary recognition of our prescriptive rights to control lighting, buoying, and policing of Gulf in the same way that our position has been recognised in respect of quarantine, in regard to which the position might with advantage be reaffirmed incidentally. 2. Documentary recognition as a permanency of the old prescriptive postal rights and privileges which we still enjoy, and an expression of readiness to see those extended to other Persian ports of the Persian Gulf as occasion may require. 3. Undertaking to refrain from giving any lease or concession, commercial or otherwise, in Southern and South-Western Persia {i.e., in the area comprising the British and neutral zones under the Anglo-Russian convention), or in Persian islands of the Gulf, to any foreign subjects or Government, without the knowledge and consent of His Majesty’s Government. We have precedent for such a request in the under taking given by the Shah to the Russian Minister referred to in Mr. Marling’s telegram of 27th August, 1908, to the Foreign Office, repeated by me to India on the following day. This, perhaps, might be secured in the course of current negotiations for mining concessions. 4. Extension of rights of navigation to the Upper Karun. 5. Abandonment of empty claims to sovereignty over Bahrein and recognition of our protective rights over those islands and Tracial Coast and our title to protect their subjects in Persia. 6. Undertaking to grant option to British company when the time is ripe for formation of lighterage company in Gulf ports. 7. Acceptance of consular officer at Bampur when needed. I make no suggestion here in connection with Kishm-Henjam position, as we appear to be effectively consolidating ourselves in an unobtrusive way, and further openings are likely to offer themselves. I have expressed views on the strategical question in my telegram No. 10, dated 3rd January, to India and Tehran. / PERSIA. [January 19.] mpNEIDENTIAL. Section 1. [2825] No. 1.

(April 17, T40 p.m.) SOME weeks ago, when discussing question of cancellation of Muin-ut-Tujjar’s concession with Minister for Foreign Affairs, I put forward suggestion, as coming merely from myself personally, that possibly, in view of financial difficulties in which Persian Government found themselves, some arrangement might be come to under which His Majesty’s Government might purchase or acquire on long lease islands of Larak, Henjam, and the whole of Kishm. Idea seemed to commend itself to Minister for Foreign Affairs, who said that sale would be impossible, but that lease might be arranged if terms were made attractive. I said that a lease would of course imply total surrender, for period of its duration, of the islands upon which British flag would be hoisted for such purposes as His Majesty’s Government might require. Nothing more was said on the subject until two days ago, when, upon my again referring to question of Muin-ut-Tujjar’s concession, Minister for Foreign Affairs asked whether I could give him some idea how much His Majesty’s Government would be prepared to pay as rent for islands. I answered that I had no idea, as suggestion had never been submitted to you, and I had no notion of how such a proposal would be received. At his Excellency’s request, I promised to lay matter before you by telegraph. { * y I f I £ \ * ; 1/Vr ll&gt; ' C 0NFIDE ]SITIAL. kA . r: 11 ? v * j* I. i Sir Edward Grey to Sir W. Townley (Tehran). (No. 20.) Foreign Office, February 7, 1914, 1 p.m. YOUE, telegram No. 16 of 15th January : Muin-ut-Tujjar. Question has again been carefully considered with the India Office, and the con clusion arrived at is that you should insist very strongly with the Persian Government on the improper way in which the cancellation of concession, formally announced to His Majesty’s Legation, was withdrawn hy four Ministers. This action cannot be accepted as valid, and you should point out to Minister for Foreign Affairs the deplorable effect which maintenance of Muin’s concession will have on His Majesty’s Government, and press for its definite withdrawal, following up this demand by action proposed in Sir P. Cox’s telegram of 23rd October last. I am not, however, prepared to use active pressure to this end, and you are therefore authorised, as a last resort, to propose either that a new concession, including islands, should be given to a British firm approved by His Majesty’s Government with the Muin in partnership and foreign participation expressly excluded, or to agree to restoration of concession to Muin on condition that Zarak, Kishm, and Henjam are excluded, and that Persian Government give written assurance that no concession will be given on those islands except on terms and to British firm approved by His Majesty’s Govern ment. In either case the whole of Kishm Island should be specified, and any concession to British firm on islands should be permanent and not for short terms.^ I prefer first alternative, but leave choice to your discretion in view of local circumstances. In any case a proviso should be made that the rights of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company will not be infringed. dIn any further communication on this subject, please quote No. 2071/14. and address— The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, London.
