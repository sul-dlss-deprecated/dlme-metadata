Either a Certificate of Identity or a vira on a passport was necessary as in the absence of one or other Abdul Jalil would not have been permitted to leave Bahrein by steamer. As Abdul Jalil's naturalization has no effect outside British India, he must in Bahrein be treated as a Persian subject. As Persian subjects who ar^ not in possess ion of Persian passports nay be given Certificates of Identity to return to Persia only ( see your No.485-S, dated the S5th November 1926) , it would appear that my right course was to give Abdul Jalil a Certificate of Identity to enable him to travel to Lingeh or Bandar Abbas and there tal^e out a regular Persian passnort vised for Bombay. It would however be farcical for an Indian Government Official not resident in Persia to force a naturalizedHO naturalized BritiBh subject, the holder of a BritiGh Indian paGBpoft, to take out a Persian passport before returning to Bombay.

Subject:- Arrival in Bombay of one Mohanmacl bin Mohamad Rafi with a forged passport. . Sir, I am directed by the Governor in Council to state for your information that a Persian lad named Mohammad bin Mohamad Rafi, j aged about 20 years,arrived in Bombay from Bahrain on the 23rd November 1928 by the S.S. H Baroda!I At the time of the inspectior of passports of passengers he tendered a Persian passport - General No.5266 of 1927 which was in the name of one Abduila Special No .43 4 , 1 bin Haj i Mohammed Zaman,and which bore your visa No. 1334,dated the 12th November 1928. On examination of the passport it was found that the original photograph was tampered with andthere were visible signs of affixing a new one in its place. The description « given in the passport^did not tally with the description of Mohammad bin 'Mohammad Rafi. The latter subsequently admitted that the passport in question belonged to his friend Abdulla bin Haji Mohammad Zaman who was in Persia and that he had used it in order to save the cost of procuriiig a new Persian passport at Bahrein. Mohammad bin Mohammad Raf i was accordingly charged on the 27th November 1928 for attempting to cheat and using as genuine a forged passport. He was convicted on both the charges and sentenced to one day's simple imprisonment and a fine of RslOO/- or in default to one month's rigorous imprisonment on each char^ The fine was paid. 2. The lad desired to return to Bahrain ishere he said^he ' ' no had friends who would assist him to obtain employment and^hishis step father Haji Abdul Rahman,a crier in the Juma Masjid, Bombay,paid the cost of his passage^he was granted a visa for his return journey on a fresh passport issued in his favour by the Persian Consul at Bombay. He sailed for Bahrain by the S.S. 'Bankura' on the 26th December 1928. 3, The forged passport^which was ordered by the trying Magistrate to be confiseated / is now in the possession of the Government of Bombay. Mohammad bin Mohamad Rafi states that the photograph on the passport was pasted before he obtained your visa.

Grant of travelling passes to Bahreinis, and issue of passports by the Shaikh of Kuwait. d Sir, I am directed by the Secretary of State to invite your attention to the marginally noted correspondence with the Foreign From Foreign Office dated 1st Oct.1926 ) Office (copies of jfeks To -do- 4th Nov.1926 Q Erom -do- 31st Dec.1926 ) which were sent to you with my weekly letters of the 7th October, 4th November and 6th January} on the subject of the gax grant of travelling passes to subjects of the Shaikh of Bahrein. It will be seen that in their latest letter the Foreign Office suggest that the British certificates of identity now issued to Bahreinis should continue to be issued to them, but with the addition of a clause to the effect that they are merely a recommendation to British officials and are not intended for production to foreign authorities, and also that tacit acquiescence should be given to the practice of Persian officials in requiring Bahreinis entering and leaving Persia to take out Ilm-o-Khabar passes. 2. The Secretary of State would be glad to learn the views of the Government of India upon the Foreign Office suggestion, the probable effect of which he is not in a position to estimate with i confidence. The view of the Foreign Office that the identity certificates were originally issued solely for the purpose of production to British authorities appears to be correct, and is borne out by the orders of the Government of India in their telegram H0.IO86 -D. of the 13th March 1916, to the Chief Political Officer Basra (see Foreign and Political Department Proceedings, May 1916, General-A Numbers 59-65). The identity certificates, if The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign and Political Department.if qualified 'by the clause suggested by the Poreign Office, would retain their value in the case of travellers to Iraq or India, and as travelling documents for passengers on -British steamers in the Gulf. 3# The Political Resident, Bushire, has stated, however, (in his de^atch of the 20th May, 1926, Ko.34/202-3. addressed to His Majesty 1 s Minister at Tehranj, that the certificates are carried by travellers (both Bahreini and Persian; to Persian ports, and are accepted by Persian officials as proof of the port of embark ation. The object of the Foreign Office suggestion is to avoid I the production of the identity certificates to Bahreinis to Persian officials and the consequent risk of their being confiscated The result, however might be that travellers from Bahrein would suffer inconvenience from the want of any documents which they could produce before Persian officials on their arrival at a Persian port, or possibly they might frustrate the object desired by the Foreign Office and use the identity certificates in the same way as heretofore. 4. This difficulty might perhaps be limited by continuing to issue to other than Bahrein subjects the identity certificates now used, and issuing only to the latter a certificate qualified as the Foreign Office suggest. The Political Agent has stated that of the 6,000 identity certificates issued by the Political Agent, Bahrein, in 1925 only 800 were issued to subjects of Bahrein, while 2,000 were issued to Persians. (Incidentally it may be remarked that Persian officials do not act consistently if they tolerate the possession of these certificates by Persians and confiscate them when held by Bahreinis). But this suggestion, if practicable, would not affect the difficulty in the case of Bahreinis, and the Secretary of State does not feel altogether satisfied with an arrangement which allows them neither British nor Bahrein papers for production to Persian officials and yields so completely to the Persian claim that they should carry Persian documents. 5* It is difficult, however, without having recourse to the issue of passes by the Shaikh of Bahrein himself (a course which His Majesty's Government deprecate in their desire to avoid aa revival of the question of the status of Bahrein by the Persian Government), to suggest any more satisfactory arrangement which will avoid the seizure of British documents by the Persian authorities. If, therefore, the Government of India consider that the Foreign Office suggestion can be put into effect, at least in the case of ^ certificates issued to subjects of Bahrein, without causing undme inconvenience, I am to request that the necessary instructions may be issued to the Political Resident, and that the Secretary of State may be informed ©f the action taken in order that the necessary communication may be | made to the Government of Iraq. 6. As regards the final paragraph of the Foreign Office letter of the 31st December and with reference to your letter of the 9th February, Ko.542-H. it may be pointed out that the 'embargo on the issue of passportfe' applies only to the Shaikh of Bahrein. Apart from considerations arising with reference to the position of Bahrein the Secretary of State is not aware of any political objections to the issue of their own passport by the Shaikh of Kuwait or the Sultan of Muscat. With respect, therefore, to the proposals referred to in your letter for the issue of Kuwait passports I am to enclose, for the consideration of the Govern ment of India, a copy ©f a letter fr ®m the Foreign Office, and to say that, • provided the assurance desired by the Foreign Office can be given by the Political Resident, the proposals are approved by the Secretary of State. 7.

Sir, With reference to your letter Uo .p .650 of the 9th instant respecting the issue of passports by the Shaikh ©f Kuwait, I am directed by Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain to state that the proposal is not in his opinion open to objection p er se . 2t Lord Birkenhead will, however, remember that in the corres pondence respecting the grant of travel facilities to Bahreinis which ended with the letter from this department No.T 14112/235/378 of the 31st of December last, attention was more than once drawn to the importance of preventing the Shaikh of Bahrein from issuing passports in view of the possibility that any such action on his part might reawaken the claim of Persia to the sovereignty of Bahrein. 3. Sir Austen Chamberlain would therefore suggest that in their reply to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf the Government of India should make their approval of the proposal subject to an assurance from Colonel Haworth that there is no risk of a similar step being taken in Bahrein. 4. The proposals as to visas contained in paragraph 4 of the Political Residents despatch seem unobjectionable. 1 am, etc., Sd/- G.R.Warner.

A copy of/1916 correspondence referred to in paragssph 2 of that letter is also enclosed. It will be sean that the Secretary of State does not feel altogether satisfied with the solution of the difficulty which is put forward in paragraph 5 of your letter, but that he is prepared to agree to its adoption by the Government of India unless they should feel any insuperable objection to this course. With regard to the final paragraph of your letter the Secretary of State himself thinks that the most satisfactory solut ion lies in permitting the Shaikh of Bahrein te resume the practice which he followed up till 1915 of issuing his travelling passes. He agrees, however, that permission to do so should be withheld from the Shaikh so long as, in Sir A.Chamberlain3s opinion, the governing political considerations justify this course. A copy of your letter of the 25th February, No.T.1816/1816/378 in which it is suggested that the Government of India*8 approval of the S&amp;aiih of Kuwaiti proposal to issue his own passports should be made subject to an assurance from the Political Resident that there is no risk of a similar step in Bahrein, is being forwarded for the consideration of the Government of India.

MEMORANDUM :- In reference to the Passport Regulations, and in particular to those requiring Persian nationals to have a proper passport ; endorsed by a British Consular Agent, before they may be admitted to Bahrein, it is well Known that Persians in Persia are actually prevented by their own authorities from obtaining such passports, and have to take an Aim wa Kubr, for Bahrein. In order to comply with the Bahrein requirements, Persians are now travelling to Qatar, where^ they take a pass from Husseyn Naama the Customs Officer, either five, or two, or one rupee, according to his fancy, and on this pass, Persians are admitted into Bahrein. During the month of June, 38 Persians so came here, and in the first half-month of July 153 Persians entered Bahrein on these passes. I suppose it is a matter for the Political Authority to decide whether or not Husseyn Naama is acting in accordance with the original arrangement; but the ingenuity of Persians determined to enter cannot be denied. At present the fee for a Permit to land in Bahrein, la Rs•2/- for an adult, Rs:1/- for his wife accompanying him, and little children free. Might I venture to auggestthat the fee chargeable to Persians dejksi^ng to enter Bahrein on any kind of pass might be:- 0 . c/ for an adult, • tis: ' wife accompanying husband,... 3/-, V each child accompanying,. •• '/- I do not think there would be any serious objection \to the payment of these fees. 1 DIRECTOR OF CUSTOMS, and PORT OFFICER.

Hajy Yusuf bin Abdulrahman Pakru of Maharaq wrote me a Letter of Guaranty asking permission for this man to land so that he might receive medical treatment, which he urgently needed. Hajy Ahmad bin Yusuf Faicru also came to me personally and urged _ plea, explaining that the wounded man had recently been concernec the fighting in^Persia against certain Government troops, and if had been taken to a Persian hospital he would undoubtedly have been put into prison.

M T s Political Agent, Bahrain. ^07 f y ^ , £4-2. \' S^//V f ^gV ; - v ' Memorandnni Some misapprehension exists at present on the subjects of passports. The passport rules as regards Persians were imposed for political reasons as the accep tance of a document styling Bahrain as part of Persia is highly derogatory to the amour-propre of the State of Bahrain. For no other reason does the G-overnment of Bahrain wish to exclude Persians. According to the rules no Persian is admitted without a pass stamped 'by a British Consular Official, or a document issued 'by one of certain mainland Shaikhs to genuine Persian residents in their territories. The former ruleir is not carried out and \ the latter rule is greatly abused. f*/ / y If a Persian obtains a British vise' for Bahrain on his passport it is torn out 'by an-2- an official at the Persian port of embarcation. Persian passports are now endorsed with the words 'Bahrain, Persia' and in the aim al Khobar, alternative to a passport, the same description is used. Persians have told me that they cannot get a British vise' T in Bombay or Karachi, this I fail to nncierstand though it may have 'been refused on passports which 'bear the words 'Bahrain, Persia' The result of the regulations is a deadlock. Actually the Bahrain Government would he satisfied with any sort of document as long as it is stamped 'by a British Consular Official and §oes not describe Bahrain as Persia, Would it be possible for consular officials in Persia to issue something in the nature of an identification document to Persians wishing to come to Bahrain? The traveller could also obtain an aim al Khubar or Persian passport but this would not be shown in Bahrain, A different situation has occurred on the mainland, Persians knowing that they cannot enter Bahrain without passes are now flocking to the mainland ports where they obtain passes, at a price, and on them they enter Bahrain, This traffic of pseudo Persian residents on the coast is increasing daily, I suggest that the Shaikhs on the mainland should be asked not to issue passes to any but'but genuine residents of two years or more, or if this suggestion does not commend itself, they should 'be told that as far as we are con cerned they need no longer issue passes. The authorities here will endeavour to verify state ments of arrivals who claim to be residents of the mainland. With regard to issue of outward passports 'by this G-overnment, According to your instructions we issue passports to Persia, and return, to Bahrain subjects and Persian subjects. Certain Persians are allowed to land here for trade and in some cases for resi dence at the discretion of the G-overnment. We charge fees for permits and passes and letters of guarantee to cover the expenditure on clerks and passport services. Have you any objection to the Bahrain G-overnment issuing passes to its own / rJiationals and Persians, to the mainland ports? Unless this is done it is impossible to check the entry of unauthorised Persians from the mainland who pretend that they belong to Bahrain and have been visiting mainland ports. Unless the pass port regulations apply to traffic to and from the mainland the usefullness of the passport regulations as far as native craft is concerned is practically nullified. The passport regulations are a very great assistance in checking the entry of undesirable aliens, criminals and deported and repatriated persons, but for effectiveness it is necessary-4- 0 o necessary that they should apply to native craft as well as ships. The dregs of the gulf flow down to Bahrain in the diving season and an effective passport system assists public sucurity. Might I suggest that the scope of the Bahrain Government T s passport procedure should be enlarged; that it should issue regular pass ports to its subjects for all gulf ports and for India as is done by the Ruler of Najd # Regular passports were drafted and approved of by you. Tenders for the printing have been received, but until I hear from you I am taking no action as regards the printing. Some time ago I wrote informing you that H. E. Shaikh Hamad would welcome the suggestion that his G-overnment should issue regular pass ports as was done,in I believe, in Shaikh I^a r s regime. It would seem very suitable that Bahrain, an independent arab state should issue its own passports to its own subjects for travel ling to iieighbcuring countries.

At Bushire he took out the appropriate visa for Bombay from the British Residency there, and then proceeci^Dn to Busreh. On arrival at Busreh he produced the travelling pass issued here for that port; but was refused permission to land there by the local Passport authority who appear to have stated that such travelling pass needs a visa in Bahrein at H.B.M 1 s Political Agency.
