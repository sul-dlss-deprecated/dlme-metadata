' He agrees that Dubai could be taken out of the list as there are at present no alighting areas other than for flying boats. I see no object in this since conceivably the company may charter a flying- boat or find it convenient to use a landing area to serve an oil camp in an emergency. 3. I therefore propose to ask for the general permission for landings in Bahrain and Qatar and to inform the shaikhs of Sharjah and Dubai that these may take place in their respective territories. I shall await your confirmation before taking action. 4* Packer has asked for an assurance that a like permission will be given as regards Kuwait and Muscat. I should be grateful for material for a reply. 5* Packer adds that any other places where special conditions or circumstances are involved could be^the subject of special applications pending fuller information on the proposed movements of P.C.L. explora tion parties.

PETROLEUM CONCESSIONS LTD., BAHRAIN, PERSIAN GULF. Dated 1st September,1945 L 1945 My dear Bird R.C.L. COMPANY AIRCRAFT. In 1938/39 Company aircraft were permitted to operate in the Persian Gulf and necessary landings were made at i Kuwait, Bahrain and Sharjah. The planes were employed on special jobs to transport senior Company staff to , . Bahrain and for geological exploration over the Trucial Coast and Muscat territory. 2. As regards Qatar the India Office in 1939 intimated that there was no objection to Company planes landing at Qatar and the Company could make the necessary approach to the Ruler as laid down in the Qatar Oil Concession. The India Of ‘ice also agreed to the Company constructing its own landing ground adjacent to the oil field. Up to that time the India Office had not arranged for the issue of general regulations for civil aircraft in Qatar. 3. The matter has now been re-opened by Haifa consequent upon a London query, asking if our machines can be permitted to land at Kuwait (for refuelling), Bahrain and Qatar. 4. 7/e should be very grateful for information on the following points (a) Can it be assumed that there is no objection from His Majesty’s Government or any other official source to our planes landing at Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar. (b) Can similar landings be made on the Trucial Coast and in Muscat, i.e. in territories over which the Company holds oil agreements (excluding, of course, areas which may be specified by His Majesty’s Govern ment from time to time where ownership is contro versial). (c) To whom should we make prior reference in respect of landings in various territories ? (d) In what Shaikhdoms do general regulations for civil aircraft already exist and if non-existent what is the alternative procedure ? (e) .'/ill it be possible at this juncture to obtain general permission to cover any number of landings at all places over a period of at least a year or more provided all planes to be used are listed on the respective permits ? (£) Can it be assumed now that the v/ar is over that the Company is free to proceed with the construction of its own landing ground at Qatar, if it so desires, the India Office 1939 permission and that and/or B.O.A.C. angles need not now be account ? / 52 ;1 5. It is not anticipated that landijigs at9Mferwml .take place until a new landing ground but circumstances might arise in which the use of the DoHah R.A.F. landing ground would be necessary, 6. barly information would be appreciated on our query para 4(a) and if this does not entail reference to the .

Instead, however, of the Company negotiating with the Shaikh for an amendment to the sixth Article of their Concession (vide paragraph 3 of Weight man* s letter), it would be simpler for the Shaikh to give the Company a general permission by letter.

With regard to the question of general regulations for civil aircraft visiting Qatar f I would suggest that there is no need to contemplate their issue at this stage. The Company will however be bound to negotiate with the Shaikh for some amendment to the sixth article of their Concession if they are to avoid the necessity of obtaining the Shaikh's permission every time one of their aircraft is to visit Qatar. 4.

The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Camp, Bahrain. Memorandum Reference Air Officer Commanding’s secret letter Ho.10547/4/Air.0., dated the 6th February 1939, forwarding an appreciation in respect of the defence of Qatar. 2. Since admittedly this appreciation is designed for temporary purposes pending fuller infomation of the possibilities of oil development in Qatar I need not make any lengthy comment. I have the following remarks in regard to details: Paragraph 2 of the Appreciation It gives a scamewhat incorrect impression to say that the peninsula is practically uninhabited in the interior, since at most times there are large numbers of nomads. It would be more correct to say: ’’There are practically no permanent habitations in the interior, but at certain periods of the year there are nomads in considerable numbers”. Pa ragraph 5 The name of the Oil Company is 'Petroleum Development (Qatar) Limited” and its camp is roughly two miles inland from the western coast. Paragraph 7_ First sentence, last word ’’Hummocks” would be more correct than 'Hills”. Last sentence It would be more correct to say : 'There is difficultA - —— hilly country (though north-east of the Oil not high Camp and hills) immediately north test well. 2 . and Paragraph Jh_ I do not quite understand why Dohah should be named as an important tactical point. It is not actually the Shaikh’s capital, it is a very bad port, and its only importance seems to be that it is the largest ’’town” in Qatar. The aerodrome to the north of the town is not, to my mind, well located strategically. Paragraph 12. As stated above I think the Dohah landing ground is badly placed. It is 55 miles by road from the Oil Camp which, assuming oil developments, will presumably be the main point of defence. I have personally seen an area about 2 miles frcm the Zekrit landing, on the road from Zekrit pier to the Oil Camp, which could be cleared and used as an aerodrome very cheaply. The Royal Air Porce will presumably wish to verify this view and the Air Liaison Officer might take an early opportunity of visiting Zekrit. In so far as expenditure is concerned, I think the Oil Company will be prepared to meet the cost of clearance provided it is allowed to use its own aircraft in normal times. P aragraph 15. The recommendation to secure the Salwa Wells presumably depends on the existence of a state of war with Saudi Arabia or of anarchy in Saudi Arabia. In other circumstances I do not see how forces operating in conjunction with the Royal Air Force can enter Saudi territory to seize the Wells. To my mind the importance of these Wells is over estimated, and I am inclined to believe that even 3edu forces would /3. v/ould not be entirely dependent on them. nevertheless I admit that Salwa. would be a useful gathering point for such forces. Paragraph 18 — — .-Jw. . .A.. I am strongly in favour of encouraging the Shaikh oi Qatar to buy four, if not six, Bren or Lewis guns, and mount them on Ford 7-8 11 picx-ups' . He himself is very anxious to have armoured cars, but it should not be difficult to convince him that these will be useless in Qatar, and he will certainly be eager to purchase the next best thing. Para graph 19 . The Shaikh is purchasing 2,25,000 rounds of ammunition. Paragraph 25 I strongly support the recommendation made here for Koyal Air Force exercises in co-operation with the Shaikh's forces. Apart fron their training value they should have considerable political effect. (Sd . ) H.

V I | FROM SECRETARY, POLITICAL AND 8SCNET DEPT. INDIA OFFICE We have the honour to invite a reference to your letter P.Z,2926/57 dated l 8 th May, 19?7&gt; regarding the use of aircraft in the Persian Gulf area, and particularly to paragraph 4 thereof which relates to Qatar. Since October last we have established a drilling camp at Dukhan on the Western side of the Qatar Peninsula, and are now busily engaged in putting down a test well. The requirements of this camp necessitate constant communication with B ahra in where the headquarters of our parent Company, Petroleum Concessions Ltd., are established. In addition it is necessary that Qatar should be visited from time to time by the heads of the various technical departments in London of Iraq Petroleum Co. Ltd., who supervise the operations of our Company. The only convenient and quick method of getting to Qatar is by 1 plane, and ordinarily we should use the 1 planes of Iraq Petroleum Co.Ltd. for such visits. There is a landing ground on the Eastern side 01 the Peninsula just North of Dohah. This ground 3 II JA1M1939 ijE 65 miles from our drilling camp and is unsuitable INDIA OFFICE!H /«?• 51 vK for our machines because it is too small and not well sited with reference to the prevailing wind. It has, therefore, been suggested that a new lending ground should be made by this Company in the vicinity of our drilling camp. The Shaikh of Qatar has informed us that he has no objection to this proposal and we should, of course, before making a selection of a site, consult the Political Resident and the Air Officer Commanding the Middle East. 7/e are prepared to give an assurance that, if this landing ground is made and is regularly used by the Company T s f planes, instructions will be issued that no flight should be carried out on the extreme Southern section of the territory. V^e should be glad to know whether the proposal that the Company should make its own aerodrome is approved by His Majesty T s Government. In connection with this proposal, we should be glad to know whether any general regulations for civil aircraft, such as are contemplated in Article y 6 of the Qatar Political Agreement dated 5 th June, 1955 ^ sr e likely to be made in the near future. If there are, it would be a decided convenience if a regulation could, with the consent of the Shaikh, be included which would exempt the Company from having to obtain special permission every time its own ! plane landed on its own landing ground, provided the passengers carried were Directors of the Company, or members of the Company f s home or foreign staffs, or of the home or foreign staffs of Iraq Petroleum Co. Ltd. or of Petroleum Concessions Ltd., which staffs are for practical purposes interchangeable with those of Petroleum Development (Qatar) Ltd. We have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient servants. For PETROLEUM DEVELOPMENT (QATAR) LIMITED, to jtf tlvU ^ ttur &lt;Aa kc &lt;j| ai;A»£r.1 P.Z.2926/37. l« ]\th May y 1937 Sir, In reply to your letter of the 24th March, No.p.c.27/28/30, 1 an directed to inform you that His Majesty 1 s Government see no objection hn prin ciple to 'che use of aircraft for transport or survey in the Persian Gulf area, provided (a) that the consent of the Sheikh concerned is obtained beforehand and rhe area over which the Company would propose to fly explained to him, (b) that the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf or the political Agent concerned is kept in close touch with the Company’s plans and is consulted as to the suitability of the aircraft and equipment (e.ga wireless), which should in any case conform to the regulations regarding airworthiness etc. which apply in Bahrein (or Muscat), (c) that any air survey company which may be employed is a British firm of undoubted repute under entirely British direction and employing British nationals or natives of the Arab state concerned. 2. Ac regards the specific proposals of the Company, His Majesty’s Government are of opinion, after consulting the loco.l political authorities, that it would be best to postpone any air survey (or the use of aircraft for transport) on the Trucial Coast until the concessions have actually been obtained from the Rulers. The use of aircraft is provided xor in the draft concessions, and when these are obtained there will be a certain The Managing Director, petroleum Concessions Limited, City Gate House, Finsbury Square, 2.0.2 obligation/im*i ii / a \zy (vk y i s * 'V o obligation on the Hulers concerned to co-operate in the matter. But in the meanwhile it ’would not be possiole ^ '* V v to count on the Rulers 1 co-operation except as a special favour (for which they might expect some return) , and it would appear undesirable at this stage to ash more favouro of them than is absolutely necessary. 3. The same reasons against any immediate action apply to Muscat with greater force, in view of the fact that the negotiations with the Sultan have not begun. 4. As regards Qatar, the previous permission oi the Ruler is specifically required (under article 6 ol the Concession) for the use of aircraft. His Majesty’s Government see no objection to the Company approaching the Sheikh (through the local political authorities) for the necessary permission, but they are anxious that flights over the extreme southern section of the territory lying within the boundary of the oil concession should, as far as practicable, be avoided or at any rate limited to a course lying well within the concession line. fhey would also like to be informed through the local Political authorities Y/ell in advance before any regular flights are begun in the southern area. 5. Since His Majesty's Government have had this matter under consideration, there have, as you know, been reports of differences arising between the Sheikh of Qatar and certain tribesmen in the neighbourhood of Zubarah. The Company will of course appreciate that these occurrences might necessitate some postponement of the approach to the Sheikh which is envisaged in the preceding paragraph.

INDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL, S.W. 1. 26th April, 1937. Dear Brenan, ./ill you kindly refer to the letter from Petroleum Concessions Limited dated 24th March, a copy of which was sent to you under P.Z. 2008/37 on the 3rd April, regarding the Company’s desire to use aeroplanes for transport and air survey in Qatar, the Trucial Coast States and Muscat. In our telegram of the 8th April we asked the r'olitical Resident for his views on the Company's proposal, and I now enclose a copy of his / reply dated 14th April. 2. The position under the various concessions (or draft Concessions) is as follows:- (aj j^atar. In Article 3 of the Commercial Concession, the Company 'shall explore the State of Qatar minutely by any method which is best in its opinion ' Under Article 10 it is entitled to import aeroplanes free of duty. Under Article 6 it 'has the right to use all the means of transport required for its operations in T.V. Brenan, Esq., O.B.E. , Foreign Office, S.W. 1. accordance/■^HjH —m 2 . accordance with this agreement, excepting aerial transport, v/hich, on every occasion arising for it the Company must obtain the Sheikh’s permission and consent thereto'. Under article 6 of the Political agreement any right given by the Company under the Commercial agreement to utilise means of transportation by air is made subject to any general regulations for civil aircraft made by the Sheikh on the advice of His Majesty’s Government. (There are as yet no Qatar Air Regulations). Under Article 5 the Company gives a general undertaking at all times to pay due deference to the advice of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. (b) Trucial Coast States . Under Article 9 of the draft Debai Commercial Agreement (which of course is a common form agreement for the Trucial States as a whole and is about to be signed) the Company has the right to import aircraft free of duty. Under Article 11 the Company has the right to construct, maintain and operate aircraft and buildings and landing places for aircraft. It may also instal and operate without hindrance all such means of transportation by land, air and water as are necessary for its operations under the Concession. Under Article 6 of the Political Agreement any right given to the Company by the Commercial Concession to utilise means of transportation by air, is made/made subject to any general regulations for civil aircraft made by the oheikh on the advice of His Majesty’s Government (there are as yet no Air Regulations for any Trucial Coast state )&gt; and to any instructions which may be issued by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf . There is also in Article 5 the general undertaking to pay due deference to the advice of the Political Resident and his subordinates. (cj Muscat . The present idea is that any Muscat Commercial concession if and when obtained and Political Agreement would be on the sa/ne lines as those in regard to the Trucial Coast States. 3, It is clear, therefore, that so far as aerial transport is concerned, the Company has, or will have, the necessary rights under the Commercial concessions. In the case of Qatar the necessity for the previous consent of the oheikh is clearly laid down, as Colonel Fowle points out in his telegram, while in the Trucial Coast draft concessions, the previous consent of the Sheikh is not specifically required; but the Company v/ould perhaps consult the Sheikh concerned beforehand in any case. As regards aerial survey, there does not appear to be any specific provision in the Commercial Agreement, but presumably it may be taken that ' transportation” includes survey. 4, The position under the Political Agreements is thatin regard to Qatar His Majesty's Government have an indirect control over the Company's actions in this matter, while on the Trucial Coast (and in Muscat) they will have the specific right to issue instructions through the Political Resident. 5. We now come to the question of the precise answer which should he given to the Company. As you will see, the Resident does not appear to see any objection in principle to the use of aircraft for transport or survey by the Company, but while he would allow it at this stage in Qatar, he is inclined to think that it is too soon for the Company to consider using aeroplanes on the Trucial Coast or in Muscat, 6, On the question of principle there does not seem to be any reason why we should dissent from the Resident’s view. We are, of course, concerned to avoid any development of private flying on the Arab Coast, and we are also indirectly concerned with the security of the Company's operations and employees. On the first point there is obviously a clear distinction between private flying as such, and the use of aeroplanes by a Company holding a concession from the Ruler in question. Moreover, we have already agreed that the Kuwait/Kuwait Oil Company may use aeroplanes for its operations. On the second point, there is no reason to suppose that the Company's employees would 'be running any more risk 'by flying than they would hy going about on land. In fact I suppose it is probably the case that flying would actually be safer than going about by land. In the case of survey, particularly, the fact that the aeroplanes would do the job in such a very much shorter time than a land survey is, no doubt, an argument in their favour from the security point of view. It might, hov/ever, be a good plan, if the Air Ministry agree, that we should tell the Resident to consult with the local air authorities as to the suitability of the aircraft and other equipment which the Company may intend to use, and to make sure that any aeroplanes to be employed conform with the Bahrein Civil Air Regulations as regards airworthiness etc. 7. We would accordingly propose, if the other Departments agree, to inform theCompany that His Majesty’s Government see no objection in principle to the use of aircraft for transport or survey, provided that (a) the consent of the Sheikh concerned is obtained beforehand and the area over which the Company would proposeto fly explained to him; (b) that the Resident or the Political Agent is kept in close touch with the Company's plans and is consulted as to the suitability of the aircraft and equipment (e.g. wireless), which should in any case conform with the regulations regarding airworthiness etc. which apply in Bahrein (or Muscat). 8, As regards the specific proposals of the Company, we would propose to inform them that they may go ahead as soon as they like with the Sheikh of Qatar (approaching him through the local political authorities in the first place), but that they should take steps to ensure that the aeroplanes will not operate in any area further south than the Resident or Political Agent feel to be safe, in view of the claims of Ibn Baud to some of the territory in this area. We would, however, suggest to them that they should not for the present take any steps in regard to the Trucial Coast or a fortiori in regard to Muscat, for the reasons which Colonel Powle gives. 9. As the Company asked us on March 24th for an early reply we should be most grateful if you would kindly let us have an answer as soon as possible.I am sending a similar letter to Pirie and Seal.

PC. 27/28/30. City-Gate House, Finsbury Square, London, E.C.2. 24th March, 1937. The Under-Secretary of State for India, India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l. Sir, As you are av/are, we hold a Concession over the Peninsula of Qatar and five Options on the Trucial Coast, some of which are now in process of being converted into Concessions. In addition, we are hoping to obtain an Option or Concession from the Sultan of Muscat very shortly. Our experience with geological reconnaissance in this part of the world to date has shown that the lack of water, the lack of roads, and the difficulty in obtaining supplies makes progress extremely slow. In other parts of the v/orld it has been found that an aerial survey can often give more useful results than reconnaissance on the ground, and that such results are obtained in a tithe of the time. We would therefore like to investigate the possibility of arranging aerial transport for our geological parties working in these areas. Furthermore, our friends, the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, have, we understand, made arrangements for an aerial survey to be carried out for them this Spring in Southern Persia by Aerofilms Ltd., a well-known firm which specialises in work of this description. We would/would like to enter into negotiations v/ith this firm with a view to exploring the possibility of having an air survey made of (1) the Qatar Peninsula, (2) the Shaikhdoms of the Trucial Coast, and (3) Muscat, as soon as the firm has completed its work for the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. We should be greatly obliged if we could be informed at an early date whether His Majesty's Government would have any objection to our arranging aerial transport for our employees in these areas and/or for an aerial survey to be carried out on our behalf. We have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient servants. For PETROLEUM CONCESSIONS, LIMITED. (Sgd.) J. Skliros.
