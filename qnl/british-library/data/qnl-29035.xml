It would be hard to eny whether Article 4, whi^ determiner the frontier, ie sufficiently preaise to obviate future qu^r^«l* but it at lea t allo- catee the principle disputed areas. It is perhaps rather a pity that even now certain ooints should be referred beck to the status quo before April 1933 and to Ihn Sa’ud’s A bitra 1 award of December 1931.

(a) Since the writer returned from leave, he has found many opportunities of discussing past Yemen events with a number of Bedouin trans-border Chiefs, as well as with the Shaikh of Kuwait and notables of the Town. On all sides he has been told that Bin Saud has definitely lost much 'prestige ,f as a result of the War. had Everywhere the belief is very strong that/Bin Saud been strong enough, nothing in the world would have prevented him from over-running or crushing Yahya. Pie however found himself in imminent danger after his seizure of Hodeida, of being’ surrounded and his armies destroyed, so he wisely obeyed the instincts of self-preservation and made the peace he did. Yahya was also satisfied, being an old man and without aggressive ideas - for had he not won the moral victory and forced Bin Saud to with draw, without so much as surrendering an inch of Yemen territory, or paying a rial by way of indemnity? (b) The barren Hejran after all was no gain to Bin Saud, but has merely been given to her own people, the Yam tribe, who are blood brothers of the Murra and Ajman tribes .
