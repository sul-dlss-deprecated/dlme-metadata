Our attitude with regard to Missions is, as you say, one of neutrality - as a rule benevolent neutrality - but we don’t try and force them on an unwilling Sheikh. If Sheikh Mubarek invites them it is his own look out, but when once the doctor is installed, no doubt others will follow^including probably Miss Miller whom the Sheikh turned out on a previous occasion. Let us hope the Sheikh won’t fall out with them later and want us to help him to turn them out, for we shall not be able to help him. Once in they will be always with him liite the poor. I presume the Sheikh realizes all these things. Captain W.H.I.

From— Captain W. FI. I. Shakespear, I.A., Political Agent, Kuwait, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. With reference to my letter No. 196, dated the 27th April 1910, reporting the establishment of the American Dutch Reformed Church Mission in Kuwait, I have the honour to submit for consideration the following further developments. 2. Some days ago Dr. Bennett, who is in charge of the Mission in Kuwait, told me in confidence that he was endeavouring to negotiate with the Shaikh for the purchase of a plot of land to the west and clear of the town, on which, if it could be obtained at a reasonable figure, the Mission proposed to build a hospi tal and quarters for its members much on the lines of their station in Bahrain. He added that, as the Shaikh seemed dubious, he had explained the Mission had no ulterior political motive, its sole concern being to give general medical relief and so help the poor, whilst the members by their own lives set an example of godliness and upright living. He had found the house at present rented to be almost unbearable in the hot weather and far too small and ill-adapted to their medical and private needs, besides being inconveniently situated. 3. This morning the Shaikh himself broached the subject to me enquiring whether the British Government would have any objection. The Shaikh was not very definite as to the extent of ground or the terms on which he would grant Dr. Bennett’s request, being more concerned in obtaining our approval to the proposal. The site likely to be selected is a spot just clear of the town on the west and would be to the eastward of and about f of a mile from the limits of our Bandar Shweikh concession The Shaikh’s reason for enquiring is of course due to the prohibitory clauses on the subject of land acquisition by foreigners contained in the 1899 Agreement and the Bandar Shweikh Lease of 1907. 4 Shaikh Mubarak is I think anxious to fall in wdth Dr. Bennett’s proposal, as he is convinced no political complications are entailed, while he secures the advantages of independent and thoroughly efficient medical treatment for him self and household, not to mention a round sum of money for land which he is not likely to receive from any of his own people. 5. From our own point of view, I venture to submit that so far from the suggestion being adverse to our interests, it will really help to strengthen our position in Kuwait and .that in an absolutely unexceptionable manner. The Mission must in the circumstances remain under British protection and so in crease our prestige, it will have a civilizing influence generally, and the reports of its work gradually spreading among the wild tribes of the desert cannot fail to enhance the existing English reputation for charity, justice and good Govern ment, for even well-educated Arabs can hardly differentiate between the British and American nations. The Turkish Government can have no ground for complaint for the Shaikh himself invited Dr. Bennett originally, and besides, the American Mission in Basrah is officially recognized by the Porte, from whom it enjoys certain privileges. Nor do I anticipate in its permanent establishment the opening of any new avenue for further Turkish interference in Kuwait matters.2 6. I have the honour to recommend, therefore, that I may be instructed at an early date to convey Government’s concurrence to the Shaikh, provided that the limits of our own concession are not invaded. I would solicit the favour of an early reply for the reason that I know Dr. Bennett is anxious to leave Kuwait for Maskat and is delaying his departure only to conclude the present negotia tions, and moreover the Shaikh might find difficulty in explaining any undue delay without allowing some hint of his obligations to us to escape him. No. C.-53 (Confidential), dated Koweit, the loth August 1910. From— Captain W. H. I. Shakespf.ar, I.A., Political Agent, Kuwait, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. With reference to the correspondence ending with my letter No. C. 51, dated the 3rd August 1910, regarding the sale or lease of certain land by Shaikh Mubarak to Dr. Bennett of the American Mission, I have the honour to enclose copy of a letter Dr. Bennett has addressed to me. 2. The subject was discussed during your visit to Kuwait, and, as the attached letter shows, there is no reason to anticipate that the establishment of the Mission on a permanent bas : s will furnish the Turkish authorities with any excuse for interference in Kuwait matters. 7 3. The terms of Dr. Bennett’s letter will probably be submitted to the annual General Meeting of the Mission to be held in Bahrain on the 5th Novem ber 1910, and if desired there would, I think, be no difficulty in obtaining a more formal undertaking, duly ratified by the General Meeting, which all subsequent members of the Mission in Kuwait would be bound to acknowledge as binding. A draft Resolution to be passed by the Meeting would perhaps be most satis factory from our point of view. Dated Koweit, the 10th August 1910. From— Dr. A. K. Bennett, American Mission, To— Captain W. H. I. Shakbspear, Political Agent, Kuwait. As you are aware I have been here for some months endeavouring to culti vate friendship with the Shaikh and to start medical work, and 1 have so far been successful in that the Shaikh seems to welcome the idea of myself or one of my comrades in the mission remaining here permanently. Being aware of the intimate relations existing between the British Govern ment and the Shaikh of Kuwait, my Mission would of course like to know that we have the countenance and good-will of the British Government for our enter* prise before coming to any definite agreement with the Shaikh for the acquisi tion of suitable permanent accommodation It is well-understood, as far as f am concerned, and I am sure that the head of my Mission would be prepared to write to you categorically to the same effect, that, while it is our hope and inten tion to carry on our work and arrange any little difficulties, which may arise from time to time, direct with the Shaikh ; in the event of our being unable to settle them in that way we would in all cases refer difficulties to the arbitration or good offices of the British representative in Kuwait, and would under no circumstances seek the intervention of the local authorities at Basrah, and l may mention that the Kuwait branch of our Mission would at all times be independent of our establishment at Basrah.

Hits! m About' o'our land negotiations here— Yesterday morning George (?) came to me to say that just before Selim went up to Basra in the Shemkh’s yacht the SheiktV. said to him ttiat he did not want to sell the land to b the- Mission, but he would prefer y our giving him the plans of the house , etc, you wanted to build on it. , e he would then build them himself and lease you the lad and house when finished. George said that no figure h had been named and that Selim vas going to see Moerdyk about it as this is nothing like what you expected. I told him I would write and lejTyou know. I imagine this sort of arrangement won f t suit you at i all , though it shows what I thought all along ,viz:- t.hat the Sheikh would never hell outright . I was over at the Sheikh* s in the evening but he made no men- -tion of the natter , and I did not like to broach it my self , for it might hake him think I was at some political game and damage your prospects of getting the 1ana. Selim didn*t come to see me about it before he left, and George’s information may perhaps not exactly describe what Happened. Personally I should not be surprised if it is simply whs Shaikh's way of letting you people know that he didn't care about treating over the matter with a u subordinate libs Selim. And really I t hink y ou would be wise to comeback here yourself and carry' the thing through; if y ou can't manage to do so now, let it lie Dveir until a fortnight or 3 weeks before your Annual Meeting, then cme up and fix it all up proper to sub- -mit to the Meeting. TTo doubt Moerdyk could arrange t it if he came dovn here , but the Sheikh does not know^ him like he does y ou and from what I know of the Sheik way of doing thiigs I don't think he is likely to give Moerdyk hal' as good terms- as he would you.DRAFT — (For Approval).

A doctor of the American Mission in the Persian Sulf, Mr.Bennett, has been,for oome months in a oweit cultivating friendship with the Sheikh and practising mo'icine. he has now induced the Sheikh to agree, subject to our concurrence, to grant a site for permanent habitation on lease or purchase. A letter to the effect that the ^owoit Mission will be quite independent of the Basrah Mission; that the Mission recognise special position of the British in Aoweit, has been written by Dr.Bennett; he also writes that he has no doubt that the Directors of tho Mission will be prepared to give a written undertaking that in the event of disagreement with the Sheikh they will in no circusmtances refer to the Turkish Authorities at Basrah but will at all times refer their difficulties for the arbitration and good offices of the British Agent. These safeguards meet with the Bheikh’s approval and if they are repeated by the head of tlie Mission the Political Agent and I are inclined to favour the advent'of a doctor belonging to the Mission, but perhaps Government would prefer to get a similar assurance, from the Government of the United States in view of the recent difficulty at Muscat in a similar connection (re building site). At the beginning of November next the Mission hold a general meeting in Bahrein and Dr.Bennett is anxious to place before them views rand stipulations of the British Authorities and draft of agreement with Mheikh, I therefore solicit an early reply.

I have the honour to invite a reference to the correspondence ending with your letter No. 2571, dated the 25th September 1910, and to report below the progress which the American Reformed Church Mission in Arabia have made in their negotiations with Shaikh Mubarak towards the acquisition of a permanent site for their work in Kuwait. 2. On 25th November 1910 Dr. Bennett arrived in Kuwait after the Mission’s Annual Session in Bahrain, and handed to me the letter and required Undertaking duly signed by the Directors of the Mission, of which I have the honour to forward copies herewith. 3. It will be observed that the undertaking has been accepted by the Mission in its entirety, with the omission only of the word “ Medical.” Since the Mission only employs medical relief as a means towards its real object of religious instruction, it could not be expected to confine its labours solely to Hospital or Dispensary work, nor did I think that such an interpretation was specially intended in the draft undertaking or so understood by Shaikh Mul arak. The latter did not raise the least objection and so in the circumstances I trust that the acceptance of the undertaking as it now stands will meet with approval. 4. On informing the Shaikh verbaly of the purport he requested me to furnish him with a translation of the undertaking in Arabic in order that he might know exactly to what the Mission would be bound. The request seemed reasonable and unobjectionable, and I therefore had a translation prepared of which I gave the Shaikh a copy, and attach one for your information. 5. Dr. Bennett tells me that he desires a square plot of about 250 “ dharas ” side on the site described in my letter No. C.-51 'of t^e 3rd August 1910, and that he has available for its purchase some Rs. 3,600. He desires to purchase outright and if he succeeds, which he has every hope of doing, he will obtain some 3-J acres on an excellent site. It is probable, however, that the Shaikh will reduce the area and I understand that Dr. Bennett would be glad to accept 2 acres if he could purchase outright in the hope of obtaining more later when the Mission’s requirements necessitate expansion. He hopes to complete the negotiations before leaving by this mail, though he has not yet succeeded in inducing the Shaikh to name a price.Dated the 30th November 1910. P.S .—In his last interview with the Shaikh fir. Bennett found the Shaikh unwilling to be hurried into drawing up the sale-deed and he has therefore decided to remain another week in Kuwait for the purpose. The Arabian Mission.

Shakespear, I.A., Political Agent, Kuwait, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. In continuation of my letter No. C.-72, dated the 29th November 1910, I have the honour to report that Dr. Bennett of the American Reformed Church Mission succeeded yesterday in completing the purchase of a plot of ground from Shaikh Mubarak for a hospital and other buildings. 2. The original site has been obtained but a considerably smaller area than Dr. Bennett first endeavoured to secure. The plot is rectangular with a side of 200 “ dharas ” long on its seaward face and 170 “dharas” inland. The price paid is Rs. 3,700, computed in the usual Arab manner by lineal measure at Rs. 5 per “ dhara.” The actual area according to English standards works out to 1-756 acres. The sale-deeds beside defining the boundaries contain clauses that the Mission will recognise the Shaikh’s authority in all matters or claims, that failing a solution of any difficulty in this manner the matter in dispute will be referred to the British Political Agent and that the Mission shall have no right to seek the intervention of the representatives of its own Government or of those of any other. The conditions are clear and so far as I can see leave no loop-hole for future difficulties. 3. Both parties requested that I should authenticate the deeds as witness and this has been done. Dr. Bennett also requested that a copy of the sale- deed, which the Mission holds as its title, might be retained in the Agency records, and with this request I have also complied. the ;tle- ere. 10 . ned tish rom ase, s be nay ible don the be no dsh 8.

With reference to Foreign Department telegram No. S. -528, dated the 14th September 1910, I have the honour to forward, for the information ot the Government of India, copies ot the No. C.-72, dated the 29th November 1910. marginally noted letters since received No. C.-77, dated the 7th December 1910. f rom the Political Agent at Kuwait, forwarding a copy of the undertaking given by the Directors of the American Reformed Church Mission with regard to the establishment of a branch of their Mission at Kuwait, and reporting the conclusion of Dr. Bennett’s negotiation for the purchase of a site for the Mission House. 2. The matter appears to me to have been satisfactorily disposed of, and I trust the Political Agent’s proceedings will be approved. No. C.-72, dated Kuwait, the 29th November 1910 (Confidential). F rom Captain W. H. I. Shakespear, I.A., Political Agent, Kuwait, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to invite a reference to the correspondence ending with your letter No. 2571, dated the 25th September 1910, and to report below the progress which the American Reformed Church Mission in Arabia have made in their negotiations with Shaikh Mubarak towards the acquisition of a permanent site for their work in Kuwait. 2. On 25th November 1910 Dr. Bennett arrived in Kuwait after the Mission’s Annual Session in Bahrain, and handed to me the letter and required Undertaking duly signed by the Directors of the Mission, of which I have the honour to forward copies herewith. 3. It will be observed that the undertaking has been accepted by the Mission in its entirety, with the omission only of the word “ Medical.” Since the Mission only employs medical relief as a means towards its real object of religious instruction, it could not be expected to confine its labours solely to Hospital or Dispensary work, nor did I think that such an interpretation was specially intended in the draft undertaking or so understood by Shaikh Mul arak. The latter did not raise the least objection and so in the circumstances I trust that the acceptance of the undertaking as it now stands will meet with approval. 4. On informing the Shaikh verbaly of the purport he requested me to furnish him with a translation of the undertaking in Arabic in order that he mio'ht know exactly to what the Mission would be bound. The request seemed reasonable and unobjectionable, and I therefore had a translation prepared of which I gave the Shaikh a copy, and attach one for your information. 5. Dr. Bennett tells me that he desires a square plot of about 250 “ dharas ” side on the site described in my letter No. C.-51 of the 3rd August 1910, and that he has available for its purchase some Rs. 3,600. He desires to purchase outright and if he succeeds, which he has every hope of doing, he will obtain some'W acres on an excellent site. It is probable, however, that the Shaikh will reduce the area and I understand that Dr. Bennett would be glad to accept 2 acres if he could purchase outright in the hope of obtaining more later when the Mission’s requirements necessitate expansion. He hopes to complete the negotiations before leaving by this mail, though he has not yet succeeded in inducing the Shaikh to name a price.2 \ Bated the 30th November 1910. i 3 .#.—In his last interview with the Shaikh Dr. Bennett found the Shaikh unwilling to be hurried into drawing up the sale-deed and he has therefore decided to remain another week in Kuwait for the purpose. The Arabian Mission. Reformed Church in America. Mr dear Captain Shakespear, Bahrain, * 18th November 1910. In answer to your letter to Dr. Bennett and the letter of Colonel Cox about the Arabian Mission’s standing and agreement for the purchase of property at Kuwait, I am authorised to writers follows : — The Arabian Mission in regular Annual Session at Bahrain on November 16th, 1910, passed this resolution. Resolved, that the Mission formally endorse the conditions imposed upon us ly Colonel Cox, and that Dr. Bennett be authorised to communicate this fact officially to the proper authorities. That in copying these conditions and m signing them for the Mission the word ‘ Medical ’ be omitted.” I, therefore, respectfully ask you to receive Dr. Bennett for our Mission x?* tr r . ece ^ e ^ om hi 111 an official copy of the “ undertaking ” proposed by His Majesty’s Government and duly signed by the present directors of the Mission. I also beg to advise you that a cojiy of this “ Undertaking ” duly signed has been filed with the Secretary of the Mission for future reference and advice concerning this matter, as asked by your Government. I trust that after the receipt of this “ Undertaking ” you will acquaint the Shaikh of Kuwait of the consent of your Government to the permanent settle ment of our Mission in Kuwait and to our leasing or purchasing property there. • JAS.

We the undersigned Directors in the Persian Gulf of the Dutch Reformed Church Mission in Arabia, recognizing the special position of the British Government at Kuwait, hereby undertake—in the event of our obtaining from Shaikh Mubarak, with British consent, a site in Kuwait on lease or purchase, for the permanent establishment of our Mission—that while it will always be our endeavour to carry on our work and arrange any little difficulties that may anse from time to time, with the Shaikh direct, should we find ourselves unable to adjust our differences in that manner we will refer them for the arbitration or good offices of the British representative alone, or, in his absence, of the British Resident in the Persian Gulf. The Kuwait establishment will be entirely indejiendent of the branch of our Mission at Basrah and in no circumstances will we, directly or indirectly, seek the intervention of Turkish authorities, or of Consular officials accredited to Turkish territory.

ShaKespear, I.A., Political Agent, Kuwait, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. In continuation of my letter No. C.-72, dated the 29th November 1910, I have the honour to report that Dr. Bennett of the American Reformed Church Mission succeeded yesterday in completing the purchase of a plot of ground from Shaikh Mubarak for a hospital and other buildings. 2. The original site has been obtained but a considerably smaller area than Dr. Bennett first endeavoured to secure. The plot is rectangular with a side of 200 “ dharas ” long on its seaward face and 170 “dharas” inland. The price paid is Rs. 3,700, computed in the usual Arab manner by lineal measure at Rs. 5 per “ dhara.” The actual area according to English standards works out to i’756 acres. The sale-deeds beside defining the boundaries contain clauses that the Mission will recognise the Shaikh’s authority in all matters or claims, that failing a solution of any difficulty in this manner the matter in dispute will be referred to the British Political Agent and that the Mission shall have no right to seek the intervention of the representatives of its own Government or of those of any other. The conditions are clear and so far as I can see leave no loop-hole for future difficulties. 3. Both parties requested that I should authenticate the deeds as witness and this has been done. Dr. Bennett also requested that a copy of the sale- deed, which the Mission holds as its title, might be retained in the Agency records, and with this request I have also complied. i S. G. P.

The Doctor was afterwards followed, about a year ago, by a zealous young millenary, whom Sheikh Mubarak also made wel come. They have since pressed political Agent from time to time to concur in one or both of them journeying to Najd. He has been able to foil them hitherto by judicious application of cold water but they have now written him a joint letter requesting him to inform Sheikh that he has no objection and assuring him that they absolve Political Agent of all resnon- sibility for their safety. They claim to have various invitations from Bedouins whom they have treated medically so it ie difficult for Sheikh and Political Agent to fence with their application. These mis sionaries came to Kowelt under our auspices and to the Arab they are ^distinguishable from Englishmen. Ao missionaries it is in oav opinion inconvenient that they should extend their efforts to the interior from Xowelt where they have hardly yet settled down; for if they attempt to do any proselytising work we shall be credited with designs in that direction while if any harm happens to them it will be difficult for us to escape association in the public eye with the responsibil ity for obtaining redress or loss of credit for failing to do so. On the other hand as simple travellers they ’nave no geo graphical qualifications and we are not likely to derive any benefit from their journeys. in the above circumstances I would suggest, in order to dis courage their aspirations definitively, either that His T-aj- esty's Government should be asked to explain the position to the United ! tates Government and get a warning issued to the head-quarters of the i-'isslon, or else that I should be per- mittodpermitted to inform the head of the Miaeion in the -eraian Oulf by authority that it is inconsistent with our interests that members of the Mission should visit Central Arabia from Coast of Gulf and that we are therefore compelled to discourage such enterprise.

Dear More , To For your consideration arising out of Political Residents message today - The clear cut issue to me is the protection of British lives and property. This can be effected in one of three ways:- (A) By preventing raiders entering the town at all. (B) By holding the Residency as a fortress - all British subjects to be concentrated there. (C) By evacuation. (a) is by far the most effective, but entails the use of ship’s guns. (B) entirely ignores the presence of other white people, I.e., the Americans, and is by no means certain. (C) extremely bad moral effect and ignores the property. (A) must therefore be adopted. Consular and American Mission guard being also provided to guard against sympathetic revolt inside the walls. -That is not clear cut is the possibility of the Shaildi claiming British protection. If he does that are we to give him full support, in other words, are we to fight his war for him? As far as I understand from the papers I have got he is_ entitled to ask for protection, but I should prefer that to be settled definitely, which should be done by the Political Resident or higher authority, unless you can do it yourself.

I gave him a chance of coming to me or expressing his views by letter the other day but have heard nothing. It is this 'laissez Faire' attitude which usually leads to trouble. The questions we want answered are (i) Does he or Calverley propose to claim protection for the Americans here? (ii) If so, when and in what form? 3. Personally I think his redundant women should go if trouble threatens and this is so easily done if a reliable dhow is earmarked which can sail them off to the ship where they can be looked after temporarily. 4. The evacuation of the hospital witii its sick in all states of illness is a very different matter and I should think that it would be far better for the American men to stand by the sick and trust to the Arabs respecting a hospital. This is a point of view on which you know all and I know nothing. Does the Red Cross mean anything to an Arab? 5.

The Persian Government has asked that I should give my 'good Offices' (a much less thing than 'protection', of course) to Persian subjects in Kuwait, and the American 1925' which governs such questions 'Foreigners, wi Hi respect to whom the Shaikh of Kuwait of Kuwait ani any State, King, Chief or Government whose subjects or under whose protection they are have agreed with His Majesty for, or consented to, the exercise of Jurisdiction by His Majesty' can have practically the same privileges here as British subjects. The Shaikh has agreed that we should protect the subjects of all non-Muslim states who ask us to do so, but America has never asked us. About eighteen months ago the American Consul in Baghdad asked me for a copy of the 'Kuwait Order-in-Counci1,1925', presumably in connection with this question. No such request has ever been made, however, and until it is, I can obviously do nothing - whatever my personal wishes might be. the hospital, even in case of attack - unless of course the raiders were to get in. defending the town.
