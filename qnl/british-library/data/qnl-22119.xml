Passoort receipts fell short of the estimated amount by approximately Rs 3,GOO,/-. Judicial receints produced Rs 800,/- more than the Land registration fees and leases show a deficit of Rs 1,000/- when compared to the budgeted amount owing to decrease in land values and rentals of date gardens. Rent of Rovt. lands includes oil rent and aerodrome rent and ground rents paid by occupants of huts on government land , it has been impossible to recover the full amount from these tenants who are in many cases destitute. Interest on fixed deposits, reduced from bfo to 4$ during the year.

The catch was small and no large pearls were found by Bahrain divers. One extremely large pearl, of poor quality, was found by a mainland boat and bought by Messrs. Gozaibi Bros. No single pearl caught by a Bahrain boat is said to have realised, at rock bottom price^more than Rs 15,000/-. 2. Boats divin g. Fewer boats went out and of those that sailed the proportion of Khammamis greatly increased. The two chief systems of diving are Selafieh and Khammas. In the former case the Nakhuda is financed by a Taajar, and his divers receive the amount of advances laid down by the State, in return for the financial backing the Nakhuda sells his pearls to his Taajar. The accounts are made up at the end of the season. In the case of iQiammamis, the men join a boat and dive for one II Tershah Tt (trip) and accounts are made after each trip. Divers are advanced a few rupees and the cost of equipping a boat for a trip is much less than in the case of Selafieh boats. No debts are carried on from season to season. The Khammamis divers are less subject to their nakhudas r discipline as they are not with him permanently, they go to sea for shorter periods and on the whole their system is less substantial and less organised than the Selafieh system and their catches are usually less important. 3. Pearl prices . Almost all the pearls of the new season were sold and the price of medium and good pearls,- 2 - Pearl industry. pearls, T, sherin tf was about 20$ higher than the market price during the previous season. Unfortunately however most of the big merchants still have on their hands very large stocks of pearls which they purchased three or four years ago, at high prices, which they cannot afford to sell at a loss. If they sold these pearls now, at the market price, perhaps for half what they paid for them, many of them would become liable to make payments which they still owe and which fall due when the pearls are sold. 4. Divers debts . The divers during the last season fared even worse than they did during the previous season. Although the amount of the advances were reduced by the government to the very minimum and owing to the low price of rice etc. the cost of victualling boats was less than last year, out of 354 boats the divers of only 6 boats Selafieh made any profit. The earnings of the rest were not sufficient to cover the amounts which they had advanced and their share in the cost of rations etc. So at the end of the season the divers had increased their debts to their nakhudas and received nothing except the advances which had been debited against them. 5. Comp arisons between seasons . I have stated before (annual report 1350, page 12) that it is difficult to arrive at an accurate estimate of the season’s takings. The figures which I refer to for the purpose of estimates are those of the authorised diving clerks. These men make up the accounts between divers and their nakhudas, so the prices which they quote are the original Tf rock bottom” prices paid for pearls. These clerks have no means of-3- Pearl industry. of knowing about later transactions between nakhudas and taajars or between local merchants and foreign buyers and in each transaction the value of the goods increases. The following is a comparison of the last four seasons founded on the sources which I have mentioned above and 1 have added to it a statement of importations of pearls into United States over four years shcr/ing the three best months of the year which may be of interest. Total no. of Bahrain boats registered for diving. Total value of pearls in rupees 1347/1348 538 — 1348/49 509 21,25,000/- 1349/50 504 18,32,000/- 1350/51 456 12,14,000/- * This sum is arrived at by taking an average on the total number of boats diving from the actual sums accounted for by the diving clerks from the boats whose accounts they made up. Only about 3/4th of the boats have their accounts made up by the authorised clerks. Prom this it appears that the average production of a boat decreased by about 21% from last year T s production.

Selaf and Te s qam advances . The amount of the Selaf for the last season was decided as usual by a meeting of merchants and nakhudas at Rs 30/- for a diver and Rs 25/- for a puller. On Thursday 26th Hay which was the official day for the opening of the season, a serious riot took place in which tv/o divers were killed and several were wounded by shots fired by the naturs. At the time of the ocurrence I suggested that 1 should furnish a full report on the matter but I was told that it was not v/anted so I did not send one. Should a report on the diving industry be required I have the material available and should be pleased to write fully, or briefly, on the subject showing the changes and improve ments which have been effected since the introduction of the Diving Reforms. The subject is one which interests me particularly and I should be glad to furnish any information about it. The Tesqam was fixed for the same amount as the Selaf at a similar meeting and it was decided that the next Selaf should also be decided upon and the amount should be announced in the same iilaan that proclaimed theTesqam. This suggestion was adopted and it was proclaimed that the Selaf was to be the same sum as last year. The divers who were the ringleaders of the riot and who were among the foremost of the men who broke into the Police station prison were sentenced to various terms of hard labour, but on the occasion of H. S. Shaikh Hamad’sPearl industry. Hamad’s accession celebrations they and various other prisoners were pardoned and liberated. Bahrain diving laws vis-a- v is other Gulf States . Considerable feeling exists at present on the part of the Bahrain diving community over the unequal conditions applied to Bahrain nakhudas and foreign nakhudas. According to the Bahrain diving lav/s if a nakhuda employs a diver who actually belongs to some other nakhuda, even for a few days during the season, the new nakhuda automatically becomes responsible to the original nakhuda for the whole debt of the diver who he has employed, unless the diver has a tT barwa ,f from his original nakhuda releasing him for the season. It is customary to issue these !, barwas lf . In some cases the nakhuda writes on the 'barwa” that the diver is free to dive for the season, in other cases he is released on ,f roba 1f or Tr tilth :i , by which method the nakhuda employing the diver is bound to deduct l/4th or l/3rd of the diver’s earnings and pay it to the original nakhuda. This system is well established in Bahrain and works very effectively. When'a Bahrain diver however runs away from his nakhuda and dives with a nakhuda in Oman, or Kuwait or elsewhere, without a 'barwa' the Bahrain nakhuda finds that he has no redress. If he follows his diver to Oman and sues the nakhuda who has employed him, the most that he can hope for is that the diver will be made to return to him. In Oman and Kuwait and other Gulf States the Rulers and Courts now declare that as times are so bad they cannot possibly make their nakhudas responsible for the whole debt of a diver who they may have illegally(5) - 6 - Pearl industry. illegally employed to dive. But when a foreign nakhuda sues a Bahrain nakhuda in the Bahrain courts for employing one of his divers without a 'barwa' the Bahrain nakhuda in accordance with the Bahrain diving laws, is forced to pay the v/hole amount of the diver r s debt to his original nakhuda. The Bahrain nakhudas have no objection to the rule being enforced among themselves, in fact A is very necessary in order to prevent nakhudas stealing each other T s divers, but they consider that there should be a different rule in the case of foreign nakhudas suing in Bahrain. If, for example, by Kuwait law a local nakhuda who steals a Bahrain diver is not made responsible for the diver f s debt,equally so when Kuwait nakhudas sue Bahrai n nakhudas for taking their divers without TT barwas n the Bahrain nakhudas should not be made res ponsible for the divers’ debt but should be compelled to return the divers. The Bahrain nakhudas want reciprocal measures to be adopted in this matter.Police and Public Security. Police . At the end of 1350, the strength of the Police was 44 Indian Police and 78 Arab Police, during 1351 the complete transition of the Police from ex- Indian Army Pubjabis to a force of locally enlisted men was completed. The Indians rendered very good service to the State and their services were much appreciated especially during emergencies; they were taken on at a time when conditions, particularly public security, were very different to what they are today. When they were enlisted it was imperative that Bahrain should be provided with a force of trained men in as short a time as possible. In those days, seven years ago, the raising of a local Police Porce was not considered practicable. Though the Indians supplied a very urgent need as an armed force they were not altogether a success as Police. Very few learned to speak Arabic, they were not popular among the local people, the climate did not suit them and they were very expensive. In addition to this frequent incidents ocurred which necessitated the dismissal of several batches of men which revealed an unsatisfactory state in the interior discipline of the Force. The new Police force consists of about 40 men who were serving at the end of 1350 and about 90 men who were enlisted since then. With the exception of one Indian Jdavildar, who belonged to the original Levy Corps, all the men were enlisted in Bahrain, but they are a force of mixed nationalities including, besides Bahrain Arabs and Shia Bahama, manumitted slaves, local Persians-, and- 2 - Police k Public Security. and a sprinkling of Kurds, Iraqis, Swahili and Sudanese. Two years ago it was almost impossible to obtain local men as recruits for the Police, now when it is announced that men are being enlisted, fifty or sixty applicants attend the Fort every morning. Several causes have contributed to this changed feeling tov/ards serving in the Police; ov/ing to the general depression many men are out of work, diving is no longer a lucrative profession and local irabs who did not like to serve with Indians are willing to serve with their own countrymen. Once the ice was broken by a few men enlisting, the new recruits advertised the Police and encouraged friends and relations to join. A large proportion of the new men are divers but as far as uossible only men with small debts are enlisted; they contribute Ks 5/- per month from their pay which is Rs 25/- p.m. to their nakhudas towards paying off their debts and becoming free men. Owing to the number of applicants it has been possible to raise the standard of height and physique and most of the new recruits are physically superior to the old men. In my opinion the best type of men are those of mixed Arab and African extraction, they have more intelligence than the pure African and are tougher than the local Arab or Bahrani. It was found when the force was reorganised that it suffered severely from a lack of capable N.C.Os and almost all those who did exist were Persians. ./hen the Indian Superintendent of Police completed his-3- -!* 1*^ i a Police &amp; Public security. his agreement and returned to India his duties were transferred to Haji Salman bin Jasim, a Shia Bahrani who has served in the Police since its formation but who previously dealt almost entirely with criminal work. During the celebrations of H. E. Shaikh Hamad T s corona tion he was presented with a third star and his rank is now the equivalent of a Eusbashi in the Egyptian army or police. Various promotions were also made from the local men. Arrangements were made with the 10th Battalion, Baluchi regiment to lend the State one Havildar, two Naiks and four men as instructors and the training of the recruits has been mainly carried out by them. Their services have been very valuable and owing to their knowledge of the latest methods they are more capable and useful than any of the old H.C.Os. At the same time two N.C.Os and two men of the Bahrain Police have been sent to the 10th Battalion, Baluch Regiment, Karachi, to undertake a nine months 1 course of training as instructors so that when these four men return they vail be able to take the place of the Indians who have been lent to the Bahrain Police. Owing to the need of men for carrying out duties it is not possible to give the recruits more than six months training except in the case of individual cases who fail in the tests. Their training includes physical drill, bayonet fighting, musketry, arms drill, squad drill and instruction in general police duties. The programme is an abbreviated form of the Indian iirmy recruit training course with certain modifications. It is proposed to train the men in lathi drill if an-4- Police &amp; Public security. 6 an instructor can be obtained from the Indian Police department. Various innovations have been introduced in the routine including football, route marches and physi cal drill and fouryoung men are being trained as buglers and drummers so that when the Police go on a route march they march to music. The agreement of Captain L. S. Parke, who is now Inspector of Police, Mauritius, and who held the post of Assistant Adviser and Commandant of Police, termi nated on 25th September 1933. From the date of his departure on leave in April last I have undertaken the duties which he formerly carried out. Crime . Considering the general state of want which has been caused by the depression in the diving industry it is sur prising that there has been so little crime during the year. Only two cases of murder ocurred and one case of an armed raid on a Bahrani village which resulted in grievous hurt to the owner of the house which was attacked. A local Arab in Manamah was murdered during a quarrel by a llejdi. The murderer was tried and executed. A young woman who gave birth to an illegitimate child was murdered by her four uncles in Muharraq. The murder took place in the house of the victim’s relations which was closely surrounded by other houses. It appears that she was actually killed in the compound, by stabbing, but although the neighbours heard and were av/are of what17 Police and public security. what was happening no attempt was made to interfere. The four uncles buried the girl’s body in the floor of the house and escaped. It is thought that they are in hiding in Kattar. Towards the end of the year a night attack was made on the house of a Bahrani in Jed Ali, below Rafaa. After investigations the Police arrested one Isa bin Isa alMullah of Pafaa. The victim hovered for some time between life and death but finally recovered; the accused was tried and found guilty and sentenced to two years hard labour and deportation. The convicted man is a nephew of the notorious Mohomed al Mullah who was sentenced some years ago to penal servitude in India together with several other members of a gang of gunmen who took part in a series of murderous attacks on Bahrani villages, which were instigated by some of the Khalifah Shaikhs and who were finally captured after an unsuccessful attempt to assasinate H. E. Shaikh Hamad. The attack on Jed Ali was made by several persons but unfortunately no information was obtained as to the identity of the other men. In this case none of the Ruling family v/ere implicated. Liauor . In my last annual reuort I mentioned that there was an increase in the illicit manufacture and sale of liquor. A few years ago drunkenness was almost unknown in Bahrain but during the last year or two the habit of drinking liquor has increased very rapidly. The habit has been introduced by Jews, Iraqis and by Bahrain subjects who have travelled in !, wet TT countries. H. E. Shaikh Hamad regards the use of alcohol by his subjects with extreme abhorrence and he is greatly concernedbecause severe! of the younger members of hisPolice and public security. his own family have acquired the habit of intemperance. Prom the beginning of the year I have been dealing with this matter myself and by means of rewards I have obtained information which has led up to the conviction of about fortytwo persons for being concerned in the manufacture or sale of arrak which is a potent liquor distilled from dates. Elaborate organisations existed for selling and distilling liquor. Usually it was in the hands of a group of men but sometimes it was done by one or two individuals. They usually owned or rented several houses and constantly moved from one house to the other in order to evade suspicion. The distilling apparatus was kept in one house, usually next door to an empty or tumble down building and other houses and shops were used as distributing centres. Much ingenuity was dis played in disguising this traffic, underground rooms, false walls and wells were employed as hiding places for bottles and apparatus, in one case liquor was sold from a baker r s shop and stores of full bottles were kept at the bottom of flour bins and in a disguised oven. The greatest help in dealing detecting arrak, and a feature which cannot be disguised, is its strong sour smell and this frequently disclosed its whereabouts during searches. After making one or two successful night raids the price of arrak rose from Rs 2/- per bottle to Rs ?/- or 8/-, and I obtained information that the makers had shifted their activities from the town into the country and were sending in supplies on donkeys to the people who sold it. More informs.tion was obtained which resulted in raids on three large stills in gardens some miles outside Manamah,-7- © 1 !) Police and public security. and in two of these cases the principals were arrested although some of the gang were able to escape. Although the courts have dealt severely with cases under the liquor law the trade is such a lucrative one that it still flourishes, especially in Muharraq. In that town it is difficult to deal with, because it is under the patronage of highly placed people. The whole question of liquor is liable to become more complicated with the inevitable advent of more foreigners, apart from Europeans and Americans. Originally permits were issued only to Americans and Europeans, now permits are issued to Jews, Goanese and Indians. The local Jewish community asked that they should be given permits, but permission was refused. On this account they resent the fact that certain foreign Jews, Iraqis, are allowed permits. Apart from the foreigners there is a feeling among some of the young Arabs that liquor should no longer be forbidden but as E. E. Shaikh Hamad f s viev/s on this subject are so well known it is improbable that anyone will give voice to this opinion. H. E. Shaikh Hamad T s opinion is that Bahrain is a Moslem State ruled by a Moslem Ruler and therefore it should be 'dry' but he does not object to Europeans and Americans being given permits to purchase liquor for their own use.Judicial. Total number ofcases . 1350 1351 Bahrain Court 668 528 Small court — 355 605 1023 1133 • ******** There has been an increase of about one hundred in the number of cases heard in the Bahrain courts during the year and an decrease of Rs 2,700/- in the total amount of court fees collected from both courts and also from the proportion from fees recovered by the Joint Court which is paid to the government. xdthough the Bahrain court sits three days during the week, from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. It is impossible to keep up with the work and there are about 100 pending cases not including some 150 cases which are pending in the Shara courts and the Majlis Tajara. According to the established procedure all cases are filed in the Bahrain court which distributes them when necessary to the Shara, Majlis Tajara and Small courts. The Shara and Majlis Tajara return the %he cases to the Bahrain court with their findings which are promulgated by the Bahrain court. The small court, whose maximum is Rs 200/- promulgates its own orders independently. A great proportion of the time of the Bahrain court is taken up with land cases, boundary disputes and dis agreements over water rights and claims by the Wakf departments. .although these cases produce little revenue their settlement is of lasting value. mu other matter which also takes time is the proving of ownership in cases of sales and land registrations. As an additional measure of proof after proclamation has been(Judicial) -2- 2 i been issued calling for claims the court Be^uires the applicants to produce witnesses to establish their rights either by virtue of long residence or inheritance. This extra proof is.of value and importance and in many cases it has saved minors and women from being cheated by their relations or guardians. Appeals. A proclamation was issued at the begin ning of the year laying down a system of appeals. Appeals from the small court are referred to the Bahrain court and appeals from Bahrain court are referred to H. E. Shaikh Hamad himself. Appropriate fees are levied in appeal cases. During the year only twelve appeals were made from judgments in the Bahrain court and in almos.t all cases the judgment of the. court was upheld. Legislation on mortgages and title deeds . An important proclamation was issued during the year by which it was laid down that in the case of mortgages persons who hold government title deeds have a prior right over persons only holding sennads. This order encourages the registration of titles and also prevents further litigation on the question of boundaries, water rights and titles to property which is held as mortgage by claimants in courts. Considerable confusion existed previously as the Shara law and the local custom differed specifically on the matter of priority of claims. By Shara law the mortgage was invalid in certain cases unless it had been actually taken into possession. The law made by the government follows more closely the local custom. Siadi case . This case is now entering on its fourth year in the Bahrain court but out of the mass of different- 3 - (Judicial) different issues which are involved the greater pro portion have been decided and it is hoped that the case will be finally closed within a few months. The amount involved is over ten lacs and the court has had to deal with some fifty or sixty different issues each one involving lengthy litigation and reaching back over ten or twelve years. Court 'Vakils . Several cases ocurred during the year in which it was proved that wakils acting in the courts had misappropriated funds which had been paid to them on behalf of their principals by the court. In the Bahrain court two such persons were sentenced to hard labour. The matter is now under considera tion and rules are being framed regarding wakils practising in the courts which will be submitted to h. E. Shaikh Hamad for approval. It is proposed to demand a deposit which could consist of a mortgage on property if cash was not forthcoming, in the case of professional wakils , but persons who appear on behalf of their wives, children or near relations will he exempted from the payment of a deposit. The fees chargeable by a wakil acting for women or minors will be laid down by the court but in other cases the parties will be at liberty to come to any arrangement which they may like to. Shaikh Jasim r s affairs . Last year, on the suggestion of H. B. M’s Political Agent the Bahrain court took over the control of the affairs and property of Shaikh Jasim al- Mehza, the aged ex-&gt;di of Bahrain. Owing to his com plete blindness and the unsatisfactory behaviour of some of his relations there was danger of his extensive pro perty being misappropriated. The ^adi agreed that the———1(Judicial) -4- (»*) f y the government should administer his property and collect the rents which was done successfully for about a year. Finally however he complained and requested the government to hand back the adminis tration into his hands which was done. Litigation immediately recommenced and is likely to continue as long as the Shaikh deals with his own affairs. He was however persuaded to register all his property which will ensure its not passing out of hands. A similar case, that of Shaikh Abdulrehman bin Abdulwahab alKhalifah was dealt with by the court which made an arrangement by which one of the Shaikh f s sons should administer thei» father T s property and sub mit the accounts to the court. In this case the father was a very large landowner but in his dotage.S Land Registrations. Registrations during 1351 Sales registered 333 cancellations 13 Gifts 21 Titles 189 '■ 1457) 457. Revenue from above Rs 5,052/-. The revenue collected from registrations is about Rs 3,000/- less than the previous year's revenue. This is partly owing to the continued decrease |n the value of property and also because for reasons of economy it has been necessary to reduce the staff of this depart ment. There are now only two surveyors and it is impossible to carry out as much work as was done before when four surveyors were employed. Apart from the registration of sales and titles, the denartment submitted renorts with ulans on 346 land disputes to the Bahrain and Agency Courts; t his wor k i s unproductive of revenue but it entails considerable time and trouble, however it would be very difficult for the courts to deal with many of the complicated boundary and water right cases without the plans and reports which are provided by this department. Land Settlement . Very little survey work has been done during the year; the district of Shahrakhan was mapped and the district of Sadad, which was started in 1351, was completed. Fish Trans . 598 fish traps were registered during the year, including renewals. Printed forms are now issued for these registrations somewhat similar to those issued as diving licenses. The public as a wholeLana registrations. whole appreciate the registration of fish trans, they have gradually come to regard the possession of a T, paper from the government ,f as an inviolable proof of ownership although actually in the case of fish traps the annual registration, without registration of title, is not a definite proof of ownership. Government forms . During the year, 13,284 govern ment forms, which are sold for 2 annas each, were issued. Ho sanads or wakalas etc. are accepted by the courts unless written on government forms. These &lt;? forms correspond somewhat to stamp duties but until now the amount on the receipt or the sanad does not affect the price of the form. It has been suggested that, as in Muscat, the forms should bear revenue stamps corresponding to the amount of money which is involved. IQialifieh Estates . In my last annual report (page 34) I mentioned a meeting which took place between the hon’ble the Political Resident, the late Sir Hugh Biscoe, the Political Agent, Bahrain, and H. E. Shaikh Hamad, and Shaikhs Abdulla and Salman at which it was agreed that according to the family custom of the Ruling family, gifts of land by the Ruler were only valid during the . lifetime of the holder of the gift. On hi a-death the property should revert to the Ruler. The matter was thoroughly discussed and unanimously agreed upon by the Shaikhs. This important decision was mentioned in a letter written after the meeting by the Political Agent to H. E. Shaikh Hamad and the matter was referred to again in a public speech made by the Hobble the Political-3- 25 Land registrations. Political Resident during the celebrations on the occasion of H. E. Shaikh Hamad's succession. A few months-before the end of the year a test case ocurred. A v/ife of Shaikh Mohomed bin Isa, who did not belong to the Khalifah family, died without leaving any children. She held two or three gardens which were 'hiba' from Shaikh Isa. These gardens according to the custom reverted to the Ruler. Unfortunately Shaikh Hohomed bin Isa seized this oppor tunity to oppose the previous decision by every pos sible means and he endeavoured to induce some of his relations to support him. although his brothers and his nephew Shaikh Salman had solemnly agreed that such property should be held for life, Shaikh Mohammad denied that the custom had ever existed. TJhen innumer able examples were quoted of Shaikh Isa having taken back property which he had gifted after the death of the recipient Shaikh Mohomed tried to prove that each of these cases v/ere governed by particular reasons not by family customs. H. E. Shaikh Hamad was much displeased by Shaikh Mohomed r s attitude and by his violent language. Eventually Shaikh Mohomed suggested that if an exception was made in the case of his own property he would withdraw all opposition and give the matter his support, provided that he was given a binding written promise that the £id%e gifts of land held by him and his sons should be theirs in perpetuity, never to revert to the Ruler. It was finally decided that the matter should be postponed for a month or two; at the time of writing this report no further action hasLand registrations. 27 has been taken. If the Ruler of Bahrain enforces this custom it will assist him to establish his authority over his family. This authority in days gone by was very great but now it is merely nominal. The custom would ensure that the Ruling Family retained their estates without which they would expect even greater financial support from the State than they now obtain. It might be suggested, in fact it actually was suggested by Shaikh I.Iohomed, that the Ruler on the death of some member of the family might take over all his property and leave the family unprovided for. TThen discussing this point with other members of the Khalifah family they all assured Die that public opinion and family opinion would be sufficiently strong to prevent the Ruler from adopting such a course even if he was inclined to do so.Education. 40 The progress of education during the year has been satisfactory and no disturbances like those which took place in the past have ocurred. There are now five boys schools and two girls T schools and the total average attendance is 644 boys and girls although 828 are enrolled. Out of the 27 teachers 15 are local and 12 are foreign, the foreign ones being mostly Syrians. There is undoubtedly some feeling among the people against the foreign school teachers but the standard of education is still so low that it is impossible to obtain satisfactory local teachers for the higher posts in the schools and it is impossible to obtain any local women who are capable of teaching and managing the girls schools. ijaal^cQiiiatiuii of Dnia aiiu ouimi sciiuOa-S . o^arly in the year, at the beginning of the present school year, the Government carried out its intention of amalgamating the two boys schools in Manamah. The Manamah girls 1 school was previously housed in a building which was rented by the Government, the girls f school was moved into what used to be the Sunni boys school. It is a large airy house and suitable for a school, it was purchased as a school by the Government about ten years ago. Screens were put up in front of the windows in order to ensure privacy. The Sunni boys school moved into the big Shia school on the south of the town which was built by the government about three years ago. The school is a very fine build ing and can hold about 300 boys but at the end of the previous year only about 40 boys were attending and of these ^uite a number were Sunni. The action of theEducation. the government in combining the two schools was much resented by the Shias whose attitude was that of the dog in the manger, for about a year the attendance had been very small and the school was 3/4 empty but at the same time the Shias resented the school being used by Sunnis as well as themselves. It is true that the Shia community had contributed a small proportion of the cost of the building but as the school was ouen equally to Shias and Sunnis there was no logical argu ment against the Governments action v/hich effected a large saving in expense. Unfortunately only about 40 Shias are attending the school and the remaining 100 boys are all Sunnis. A small private school has been opened by a son of one of the leading Shias which is attended by some of the boys who were previously educated at the Government school. Topical play . At the end of the last term, a play was performed in Arabic before a large audience bv bo Tr s from the two schools. The play was written by the President of the Islamieh college in Beyrout but it was slightly adapted and made very topical. The play dealt with a dishonest T Wali’ who had charge of the property of some minors and the villain of the piece, I believe unintentionally, resembled unmistakably in manner and appearance a certain leading Muharraq merchant who recently appealed in Court on a charge of misappropriating the money of certain minors with which he was entrusted. The play was very well and intelligently acted and was altogether a success.MaHamah Muni c ipal i ty. 1350 Revenue Rs 62,000/- 1351 ' 55,000/- n Expenditure 60,900/- In spite of a falling off in revenue the Manamah Ifunicipality has carried out some noticeable improvements in the town during the year. Inner Sea Road . The new sea road running east and west along what used to be the foreshore of the town, inside and parallel to the sea road, is now almost completed at a total cost up to date of approximately Rs 15,000/-. This cost does not include the value of ground given in compensation to owners of property from whom land was taken in order to make the road. The ne?/ road will be very useful in the future and has effectively opened up the long strips of private property which extend from the edge of the town down to the original sea road. The road is 30 feet wide and averages about five feet in height from the surface of the shore. About 4000 cubit feet of stone were used for building the road across areas which had not been reclaimed from the sea. Bazaar widening . A road running up to the bazaar between the Customs House and the Police Station has been widened and extended and will eventually cut right through the town to the open ground opposite the Fort. This new road is wide and well adauted for motor traffic and several handsome new shops have been built upon it. This road has become one of the best localities in the bazaar. A number of shops and offices were partly demolished in order to make the road but whenever possible they were rebuilt by the Municipality, in cases where this could notManamah Municipal!ty. not be done the owners were compensated. A wide road running east and west from the Government school to the sea v/as made on the south of the town. About 25 barasti huts were moved in order to make the road. Country Roads , xm arrangement was made by which the Municipality became responsible for road work and repairs outside the Municipal area on the main Rafaa road as far as the end of the date gardens and also the Budeya road up to JedKafs. This previously v/as done by the government but as the municipality have a permanent staff of road men it is more economical for them to do such work. A road was made through date gardens running north and south v/hich links up the Rafaa road and the Budeya road. Previously the country betv/een these two roads was inaccessible to motor traffic except on the road from Suk al Mhamis to Senabis. The cost of this road was small as it v/as only necessary to make a few bridges and to level the surface in places. Aliening of Rafaa road . On the Rafaa road through the c : ate gardens, there ocurred during the year an accident in which a taxi collided with a car in which E. E. Shaikh Hamad v/as driving and overturned it into the ditch. Fortunately nobody was injured but the incident enabled the government to carry out the project of widening the whole road through the gardens which had been under consideration for some years. An average cf 15 feet in the width has been added to the whole road from Suk al Khamis to Raddam al Kawari and mainly owing to the public spirited example set by Shaikh abdullah-3- (Manamah Ihni c ipali ty) ibdullah bin Isa and some others none of the owners of the gardens from whom ground was taken demanded any compensation for date trees or land. About 400 date trees were cut down but except in the case of two wakf gardens no payments were made, the fences however were rebuilt at the expense of the munici pality. This road is the most used and most import ant road in Bahrain and owing to its narrowness and its many blind corners it had become very dangerous. It was unsuited to much motor traffic and a particular source of danger were the heavy lorries and tractors used by the Bahrain Petroleum Company which travelled up and down the road several times daily. The new part of the road is now being levelled and the ditches are being filled in. Road work by the Bahrain Petroleum Co . During the year the Bahrain Petroleum Co. have done a great deal of useful work on the roads which they use and owing to this the government has been saved considerable expense in the upkeep of roads. A grader has been used very effectively on the Manamah - Rafaa - Sakhir road and a small portion of it has been raised to prevent the usual flooding during the rains. The Company constructed a new road, with an oiled surface, from below tne Rafaa hill to their camp and on to Al-xjnr. Al-Amr can now be reached from llanamah within an hour, before the new road was made it took consider ably longer. Petrol Store. A petrol store was built at Suwefieh, on the shore about one mile west of Manamah. The store is 100 it x 80 feet, built of stone, cement, iron girders(Manemah Municip a1ity} girders and corrugated iron roof. Rent is paid to the Municipality by importers who store petrol there, according to municipal law shopkeepers are forbidden to store more than a limited number of tins inside the town area owing to danger from fire. Artes ian vi ells . Seven artesian wells within the town were fitted ** with valves and upright pipes* according to the government’s order. The tanks which formerly held surplus water, and v/hich bred mosquitoes have been demolished and the water is available from taps set along horizontal pipes. Repercussions from A.P.O.C disunte . When news reached Bahrain that the Persian government had cancelled the A*P.0.C agreement meetings were held among the local Persian community and a rumour was spread that Bahrain’s supply of petrol and paraffin Y/ould be cut off. In half a day the price of paraffin rose to more than double the market price. In order to combat the profiteering the government arranged for the municipality to purchase a large amount of paraffin and sell it at the ordinary price. This was done and price immediaoely descended to normal. It was after wards stated that the government itself had bought up the parafiin and having made a corner it was selling it at a high price. Municipal Ice machine. Ice was manufactured during the summer from electric power and was sold at pies per pound instead of % pies which was last year’s price. This is considered a public utility service ana the municipality contents itself with a small profit after covering all expenses.(Manamah Municipality) The lengthy disagreement involving H. 3. Shaikh Hamad, the Bahrain government and the municipality with Mr. Yusuf Khunji, the Manchester merchant was finally settled. Liability for municipal taxes . ^ resolution which the government has been urging on the munici pality for several years was passed by the Majlis to the effect that landlords, not tenants, are liable for the payment of municipal taxes on their property. It is an achievement to have secured the acceptance of this principle in Manamah, it was suggested in Muharraci, but opposed by almost all the members. xJiti-Malc.rial measures . A pump worked by an oil engine was kept working for several months pumping the water out from the swamp south of the town into a channel which carried it down to the sea. Two women were appointed to report to the munici pality cases of persons allowing mosquitoes to breed in wells inside their houses. Petrol v/as surayed A onto stagnant water on the south of the town. The council passed orders that all unreclaimed ground adjacent to the sea road should be filled in. Unfortunately these orders were not carried out and it was eventually decided that owing to the general shortage of money the owners could not be expected to undertake the filling in. junici'Dal garden. The municipal garden, which is much frequented by the public, especially during the summer evenings, has been repaired and put in order. The water channels have been cleaned out and cemented so that they are no longer a breeding place for mos-(Manamah Municipality) mosquitoes. The western portion of the garden has been laid out with oaths and trees and bushes have been planted in it. A small zoological garden has been formed which includes ibex, wolves, monkeys, an eagle and a bear, the latter was presented by Captain Prior after he left Bahrain. It was again proposed that women should be allowed to use the garden on one day during the week but this sug gestion was violently opposed by the majority of the members and by the president himself v/ho, having recently visited London, referred to restrictions which apply in iiyde Park* The council prides itself on its progressive point of view but in this matter it is extremely conser vative. Two small gardens were made in the maidan opposite the Mission church and when these grow up they vail form a pleasant oasis in that part of the town. Miscellaneous . The Municipal offices were repaired and improved, the floors were tiled with locally made tiles and the roof was renovated. Three streets in the bazaar were re-roofed. It was suggested that corrugated iron should be used as being more lasting than matting but owing to the initial expense the project was abandoned. 38,000 pies were imported from India for circulation in the bazaar. Of The rate^taxi fares was revised and tariff cards were issued to all taxi drivers. The slaughter house was repaired. 48 persons were prosecuted for failing to keep their house drains in order.(Manamah Lfuniduality) 50,000 cubit feet of swamp on the south of the tovm was filled in with town rubbish and earth, jx dozen poor boxes were set up in various parts of the bazaar. Contributions are disappointing and consist mainly of counterfeit coins. Rs 2,000/- was spent on the upkeep of the lunatic assylum. A tax was imposed on donkeys entering the town. Sheep were imported during Ramadaan and the meat was sold at cost price. During the absence of Shaikh Mohomed bin Isa, on a European tour the duty of President was undertaken by Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa alKhalifah.■ I/hharraq Ihnicipality. Revenue 1350 Ss 37,122/- 1351 Rs 33,919/- Expenditure n 28,916/- T ’ 27,758/- Outstanding against the Baladiya, Rs 3,14l/- Loan from Manamah Baladiya — also Es 23,313/- loan from the Bahrain Govt, for installation of electric supply in Muharraq. The expenditure for 1351 includes payment of an instalment, Rs 7,77l/- due to the Government from the account loaned for electric extension. Very little new work of importance, apart from the usual activities of the municipality such as street lighting, cleaning, repairs to roads etc. has been carried out during the year. Several streets in the bazaar were re-roofei, the pier was resurfaced and some roads were widened and awkward corners were removed. The style of building in Muharraq town is not conducive to or road widening as most of the houses are two three storied and the greater proportion of them are built of stone. The town is congested, surrounded on three sides by the sea, and as there has never been any room for expansion the tendency in the past has been to reduce the width of the streets in order to make more room for houses. There are no maidans or open spaces in Muharraq town and it is partly for this reason that the heat in the summer becomes so excessive that many of the Muharraq people migrate to Manamah during the hot weather. A great improvement has been effected by the filling in of one end of the creek at the Muharraq(Muharrak Municipality) Muharrak landing place and the widening of the pier near the customs house. Part of the reclaimed ground has been leased out by the municipality on very advan tageous terms. Other work carried out during the year includes the following:- Reuairing the sea wall between Muharrak and Busaiteen. Constructing two compounds for donkeys. Before these were made donkeys were left standing or tethered at any place in the bazaar. The drains from several wells running to the sea were repaired. Although most of the artesian wells in Muharracj, were made by individuals for the benefit of the public the cost of looking after them is undertaken by the Baladiya. The Government doctor treated 11,953 cases at the Maharaq disuensary. The Municipal nurse had 4,578 clinic patients during the year and attended 19 confinement cases, of which 15 were successful cases.^irtesian wells. Twelve new artesian wells were sunk in Bahrain during the year. The question of the government T s control over arte sian wells and the prevention of ?/aste of water and the elimination of stagnant water in which mosquitoes breed has been under consideration for some time. In Septr. ISo^j Lajor Holmes of the Bahrain fetroleum Go., expressed his views on the subject in a letter to H. S. Shaikh Hamad. xls the expert who first bored wells in Bahrain he pointed out the danger of reducing the water swirly and the pressure by promiscuous drilling and unrestrained flow of water. The matter was discussed and finally the Bahrain Govt, issued a proclamation laying down the conditions under which wells could be sunk which are as follows. No more wells are allowed in I’anamah, Muharraq, Hidd, or Galali as these tov/ns are well supplied with water. All wells must be provided with valves and overflow pipes so that the overflow can be regulated and when not in use the water can be turned off. Minimum length of pipe to be used in the well is 90 feet. in initial fee of Rs 100 /- to be paid for permission to bore and an annual rent of Rs 50/- for all wells used for agriculture or personal requirements. Hells used to supply the public v/ith waiter are not xiauie for tnis tax. dwells are to be inspected by a government official in order to ensure their being kept in proper order. It is hoped that these regulations will have the effect of preventing waste of water and in reducing the amount of mosquitoes.Agriculture. Unfortunately no real progress has been made in this direction during 1351. The services of Mr. Said Abdul Hour who was obtained in 1930 from the Department of Agriculture, Iraq, v/ere dispensed with during the year. Owing to lack of money it was impossible to utilise the services of this official to the best advantage. Fo funds were available for purchasing trees or for carry ing out experimental work and the cotton crop which was planted last year was not grown again, it was proved however that cotton can be grown in Bahrain successfully. The services of an agricultural expert would undoubtedly be of great benefit to Bahrain but at present they cannot be afforded. Orange cultivation . A few of the orange trees planted in h. E. Shaikh Hamad f s garden, Sanayan, on the Mani road, were allowed to bear fruit and the oranges ripened successfully and were of exceptional size and of good quality. The trees are growing well and in the spring of 1351 about one-third of the trees blossomed and many of them are now bearing young oranges. It can be definitely assumed that oranges can be grown successfully in Bahrain and if private individuals would experiment in this direction they would find a ready market in the local bazaar and possibly in neighbouring Gulf ports. Private enternrise . Cultivation is gradually increasing all over the island but the nature of the cultivation remains conservatively the same and consists entirely of dates, lucerne and a few species of localSunni T 7akf Department. Expenditure on this department . during 1351 Rs 2,400/-. This department, though its staff are paid by the government, is not under the direct supervision of the government and nothing is known of its activities. The ©balance sheet of the department is as follows.- Balance from 1350 — R$ 1,371./- Outstanding debts at end of year 1350 Revenue 1351 from shops k amaras 11,977 gardens 10,941 Expenditure 1351 Imams, Mueddins, k teachers etc. 18,815 Repairs to shops 1,650 ?f gardens 652 Balance in hand end of 1351 Outstanding debts ’ T The annual report of the department shows that 666 date trees were planted and about 6 shops were built or rebuilt and 15 shops were repaired. 10,56?/-. 22,918/-Shi a Yfakfs. 4 J Es Revenue 1350 - 18,330/- 1351 - h 20,220/- Expenditure ' 17,735/- ' 20 , 993 /- Outstanding debts due to department end of 1351 approximately Rs 10,000/- 4- ihe elections for the new majlis which began at the end of 1350 were completed early in 1351 and the new Majlis held its first meeting after Muharam. As usual the department was embarassed by the incessant quarrels among the various antagonistic factions of the Shias. Towards the end of the year a Katifi mullah of Bahrani origin organised a public attack on the Tir skf department and produced a number of public petitions, of doubtful authen ticity, asking that the majlis should be dismissed and that the government itself should deal m th all Shia wakfs. The agitation was undoubtedly encouraged by one of the Shia Kadis, Shaikh Ali bin Hasson, partly under the misguided impression that such a request would be pleasing to the government. Many of the genuine signatories to the peti tions were persons who were in debt to the department and who probably believed that by upsetting the majlis they would escape their liabilities. A proclamation was issued by the government stating that no change in the administration would be considered until all the outstanding rents had been recovered. It was hoped that as all the members were elected by the public themaelves such inci dents as this would not have ocurred but the Bahama, as 4- they admit themselves, have such a love intrigue that it A is unlikely that they will ever refrain from conspiring against a majlis which consists entirely of their own people.- 2 - Shia Wakfs. 44 During the year fifteen wakfs were discovered which had not been registered in the department and these are now being administered by the majlis. About 30 mosques were repaired and work was done in 68 gardens and ever 1700 young date trees were purchased and planted in wakf property. Several small gardens were purchased in order to consolidate wakf property and two pieces of ground were sold at a very advantageous prices and the proceeds were used to buy a more productive garden than the ones sold. ihe worK of registering the titles of all wakf property is very slow and whenever an oppor tunity occurs the Sunni neighbours to the Shia* Wakfs endeavour to prove a counterclaim.Audit. 43 During the last month of the year all the government accounts for the preceding eleven months were audited, by a chartered accountant from the firm of Whinney Murray &amp; Uo., who have an agency in Baghdad. This is the first time that any accounts of the Bahrain Govern ment have been audited. If funds were available I should recommend that an audit should take place annually. It was impossible ov/ing to the cost to afford the time to carry out a complete audit on commercial lines but sufficient detail was checked to satisfy the auditor that the accounts were properly kept and the systems were satisfactory. A number of suggestions were made which have been adopted since the beginning of the new year. ■phe auditor reported very satisfactorily on the accounts of all departments with the exception of the electric Supply department. The gist of the report on the various departments was as follows Bahrain Govt . Consolidated fund and Deposit account. Books ?/ell and accurately kept, no alterations recommended. Suggested that printed • , payslips n should be introduced to be signed by the .adviser authorising payments in place of a signature on oxfice notes. State Police . The separate account kept by the Police has been closed and the Police account is now merged into the Consolidated liind. In imprest account has been opened with the Police and all payments outside this account are made from the Consolidated Bund direct. ^ tnere is at present no Police Officer tne new arrange ment is particularly convenient.A new system was laid down for keeping the Police clothing account. Passuort department . The system of accounts was slightly altered. G tovt. provident fund . Books well kept and no alteration recommended, entries checked. Oustoms department . A few minor suggestions were made. 'The whole system of the accounts, which combine simplicity v/ith sufficient detail to enable the Director of Customs to exercise constant supervision over all departments, appears to us to be admirably suited to its purpose and we do not think any departure from the present procedure is desirable.' The report on this department is particularly satis factory as it has frequently Been suggested that the customs accounts were unnecessarily complicated and that some of them v/ere not actually required. Bahrain Electric Supply . Payments were checked with out difficulty but there was considerable difficulty in reconciling the receipts in the cash book and subsidiary books and the Bank pass book. A deficiency of appro ximately Rs 400/- was found between the Sundry debtors account and the detailed list ol debtors. It was not suggested that any misappropriation of cash had ocurred but from the state of the books it would be impossible to discover any such misappropriation. ihe reason is ascribed partly to the fact that some of the accounts were kept in the State Engineer's office and some of them in Adviser's office. On the advice of the auditor the whole system ana accounts nave been rearranged ana various changes have been made in the method of collecting.audit. collecting etc which are described in the report on the Electric Supply department. Hanamah &amp; Miharraq Ihnicinalities . Books were well kept but unnecessarily complicated. A simpler system was suggested. A number of observations were made on the various accounts in the ledger such as the necessity to provide for depreciation in the Ice machine account. In Muharraq. Baladiya it was remarked that a number of debit balanceswere due from members of the Majlis, (including the President) which were not authorised in the minutes of the majlis. The control and check over receipts from House and taxes is inadequate. xl new and more efficient system was suggested. Tnis is a matter of importance as the greatest pert of the Municipalities 1 revenue is from these taxes. Shia Wakf department . There are over 1,800 different accounts in this department and it was impossible to check all of them in the time available. The cash book, receiots etc. were checked and various suggestions made to simplify the method of keeping the accounts.Imperial Airways. On 6 tli October 1932, the first machine of the Imperial Airways landed in Bahrain on the R. A. F. landing ground behind the Palace. The machine sunk into the ground and was only able to rise, next day v/ith great difficulty. From then onwards the Imperial Airways used the lluharraq plain as an aerodrome and agreed that they would pay whatever fees or rental were decided upon when a definite agreement v/as made between the. Company and the government, the payment was to commence from the date on which tne aerourome was first used. Innumerable officials of the Imperial Airways and the R.n.F officers visited Bahrain, discussed the proposed agreement and examined sites for aerodromes. Several draft agreements v/ere produced and have been the subject of corresnondence but so far no agreement has been made and no decision has been arrived at as to where the permanent aerodrome is to be situated. The Government of Bahrain while appreciating the benefits of the nir service is not prepared to allow the company free facilities for landing and it consi ders that the company should pay to the government a reasonable amount, either annually or for each landing, similar to the fees charged in other countries. For the last eight months the government has provided a Police guard on the aerodrome on each occasion that a machine has landed in Bahrain. ito -,0 lengthly delay on the part of the company in coming to any arrangement is thought by the government to be somewhat unreasonable.£ •- Press propoganda. There appears to be a siight decrease in the press propoganda referring to Bahrain in the iirab and Persian newspapers owing perhaps to the regulation which forbids newspaper correspondents to enter the country unless they have previously obtained permission to do so. a long series of ably composed articles were published in the 'Iran” tracing the history of Bahrain and its connection with Persia from the earliest days until the present time. T&amp;e articles showed signs of considerable research both in Persian and Arab histories and in European writings and by judiciously emphasising certain points and almost ignoring other points the writer succeeded in making the Persian claim to Bahrain appear very substantial. To anyone however who was acquainted with the sources irom v/hicn the writer obtained his information and also many sources v/hich he deliberately ignored it would be apparent that the perspective of his historical summary was incorrect and leant unduly in the Persian direction. To quote an example; the writer refused to admit that Bahrain belonged to the Portuguese. lie states that Hormuz v/as originally a tributary oi Persia and was occupied by the Portuguese. T&amp;e Portuguese sent a force from Hormuz and took Bahrain but they took it. not for tuems oaves out xor xxormuz ana because nor muz was originally a tributary of Persia therefore Bahrain was taken by the Portuguese for Persia. The articles caused a great deal of interest in Bahrain especially among the Persian community.Counterfeit coins. A serious state of affairs has ocurred during the last year owing to the alarming increase in counter- , , . ts * feit/rupees which have found their way into Bahrain. ihree or four yoars ago it was comparatively unusual to discover bad coins in the market but today it has been estimated that as many as of the rupees in currency are bad ones. for over a year every coin which is re ceived either by merchants or in offices is tested by ringing on stone or metal before it is accepted. The matter is further complicated by the fact that the Bank, quite rightly, refuses to accept suspicious coins not only coins which do not ring true but also coins which are obviously counterfeited. The local people only know and admit one method of testing coins and that is by ringing them and only a few foreign merchants and Indians can distinguish counterfeit coins by their appearance. The matter has been fruitlessly discussed at great length by the two Municipal councils whose view is that the Bank and all government offices should be made to accept every coin except those whose ring is obviously false. This ^oint of view is one which cannot be accepted by the Government. A suggestion was made that the Government should levy . . . , . . bnf a snecial tax on all specie and coins imported and with the fund obtained by this tax it should buy in all counterfeit coins. This would encourage the traffic of counterfeit coins at the expense of the Bahrain tax payer. Another suggestion was that Indian cnrrency^notes should be introduced but as the lowest denomination of~ 2 ~ Counterfeit coins. of paper money in India is five rupees this proposal would nou solve the problem. It was also suggested that the Bahrain Government should establish its own currency on iiipee paper notes. In order to establish a currency a leserve iund would be necessary and this at present can scarcely be said to exist.Death of Shaikh Sir Isa bin idi accession of h. E. Shaikh Hamad’bin Isa. His Excellency Shaikh Sir Isa bin Ali alKhalifaii, K. 0* 1 . E., G. S. I., died suddenly on 9th December 1932. He was of great age and had been in failing health lor many years. He died in the early morning while H. E. Shaikh Hamad was out hunting in the south of the island. It is a significant fact and caused considerable comment that the widow of the late Ruler gave orders that the funeral should take place at once, without waiting for d. E. Shaikh iiamad to arrive. H. E. Shaikh Hamad reached the cemetery a few minutes before the ceremony was completed. Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa was on a visit to the mainland and Shaikh Sulman, who was at his country house, arrived at Muharraq^ after the funeral. Owing to the unsuitable haste with which the arrangements were made no Police or officials attended and many of the chief Khalifah Shaikhs were unable to arrive in time. H. E. Shaikh Hamad f s accession was celebrated about two months later. The principal event was a Durbar, the biggest which has ever been held in Bahrain, which took place in the great hall of the Government school, 9th February 1933 U4th Shawaal, 1351) at which the Hon T ble the Political Resident delivered to His Excel lency a 'Kharita” from His Excellency the Viceroy con gratulating him on his succession. The Kharita was received with a salute of 3£ guns and at the close of the proceedings a salute of 100 guns was fired. His Britannic Majesty f s political Agent, representatives of the Navy and Air Force, the European and American com-Accession of H.E.Shaikh Hamad. coirnrmnity and about 500 of the leading Arabs, o a dis, merchants and notables attended the Durbar. At the close of the proceedings all Shaikh iiama.d r s subjects, including the chief men of the various iirab tribes, did obeisance bo him as Ruler by kissing his forehead according to the iirab custom. i'or tiiree days there were unprecedented and universal rejoicings; thousands of poor people were fed outside the Palace, tribal dances were performed, and the towns v/ere decorated and illuminated. Ji. E. Shaikh namad succeeded to the estates of his father which consisted mainly of date gardens but as the late Shaikh had gifted away most of his valuable property towards the end of his lifetime the value of H. E. Shaikh Hamad T s inheritance was comparatively small ^ vast accumulation of official letters and corres pondence which was found in H. E. Shaikh isa T s boxes were brought to the (iovernment office to be sorted and examined but as it includes about 4000 documents it has not yet been possible to deal with them. All Shaikh lsa T s personal belongings, which are reputed of great value, were taken over by his widow who is the daughter of Shaikh Kohommed bin Khalifah who died in exile in the Hejaz. Towards the end of the year H. H. Shaikh Hamad f s salute was increased from 7 to 11 guns.54 Bahrain Electric Supply. Economic depression continues to affect the revenue of this department. Owing to the conti nued depression the number of wiring orders which were received were less than was expected when last year’s annual report was written. The revenue from sale of energy would have been greater, if many of the public, for reasons of economy, had not substituted their 40 or 60 watt lamps for 5 watt lamps made in Orermany and Japan. However in spite of these circumstances there is an increase of Rs 5 , 000 /- in the revenue from sale of energy during 1351 and the profits from wiring, in suite of a reduction in the cost per uoint, are only about Rs 600/- less than during the previous year. Running costs in 1350 amounted to Rs 37,300/- approximately and in 1351 to Rs 38,000/- approximately not including depreciation which amounted to Rs 22,473/- in 1350 and Rs 20,796/-, in 1351. During 1351 the actual loss, apart from depre ciation, was Rs 5,800/- approximately, but this amount includes, in the expenditure, Rs 3,704/- being the payment for insurance of the machinery, and also about Rs 1,200/- paid to the Customs department in dues on material imported. l It was found at the end of the year that outstand ing debts owing to the department amounted to &amp; 7,246/ The department found it increasingly difficult to col lect the amounts from nearly 400 different houses and Shops in Manamah and Ifaharraa- ^ man y cases theelectric supply) the meter readers and collectors had to call four or five times at the same house before being allowed to see the meter and before obtaining money. It was decided that from the beginning of the new year the system of collection would be altered and con- sumers would be called upon to pay their bills at the Government office instead of paying them to house to house collectors. Persons owing debts were threatened with being cut off and prosecuted and by using somewhat drastic measures most of the out standing amounts was recovered. It is hoped that the new system will be more effective than the old one The report of Mr. W. 3. Steele, State Engineer, is as follows:- The Bahrain Electric Sunnly department has again been seriously ksssa. affected by the general economic depression, but the returns -or 1^51 show a marked increase in revenue, and the p 2 s ^ocn n 13 more favourable than it was at the end ot Iodu.

Supply) oi electricity), a showroom has been opened on the sea^ road;, in a central position o posi^e the Eastern Bank, ana in a thoroughfare which rromises to be the leading street in the town of Msnamah. New ofiices have also been opened on the same site, the premises which are the property of H.B.Shaikh Hamad, having been rented by the department. Ice Plant.— The Municiusl ice riant was run very successfully during the summer of lS51, and at the end of the run the plant was given a complete overhaul. The chief components of the ammonia comrressor were renewed, such as the piston, cylinder, bearings, valves, etc., this being necessary on account of the age of the plant, which ms practically worn out. Owing to the plant having only one compressor, it base to run continuously for approximately four and half months during the season. ^ The question of purchasing a second compressor should be seriously considered for the season'of 1353. Consumption.— The revenue from the sale of electri city would have been much more, but for the fact that a large number of consumers changed their lamps from those^supplied, originally, 40 of 60 watts to 5 watts. These are' German and Japanese lamps obtainable in the local bazaar, and give just enough light to see by, provided that one has good eyesight. ' They seem how ever to suit very many of the local consumers, parti cularly those of the poorer class. It has been pointed out that if this practice increases it would call for an increase In the price of the unit to counteract the loss in revenue. Transmission losses.— Units lost in transmission during the year amounted to 18.5^ as compared to 23.4jfauring 1350. This is due to the increased load and to'the fact that transformers were switched out whenever possible during the winter. Fuel &amp; Lubricating oils.— Fuel oil costs per unit are slightly lower, .25 annas per unit as compared with .38 in'1350. due to the purchasing price of the oil bein? slightly lower, and the load slightly more. Lubricating oil cpst per unit .1 annas as_compared to .09 annas, is a little higher, due to having to run the plant on certain days every week during^ ^he winter months for the benefit of the Imperial Airways. This necessitates considerable extra starting and stopping. Normally the plant is closed down daily between the hours of 9-30 a.m. and 3-30 p.m. from November.to April each year, but Imperial.Airways L^d. having installed a wireless station in L’lanamah in connection with the landing of their machines, applied.for current on the day days^ on which a machine arrived.-4- (Bahrain Elec. Supply) xJ-thougn under no obligation to surply this, the govern ment ? m order to help the Imperial ixirways as much as possible, agreed to run when required, which very often meant two or three days a week, due to the nir mails being late on account of bad weather. Public telephones.— The government of Bahrain, in coni unction with the Manamaji Municipality, decided to instal a telephone system in the town of Manamah, using a central exchange. This scheme has been carried out by the electrical department and at the end of 1351 twenty lines had been connected and two were in course of erection. The scheme has proved a great convenience and as time goes on, the local exchange will probably be linked with the Bahrain Petroleum Coy T s camp, which is at the nearest point some fourteen miles distant. The Gamp already has six internal telephones and will in time have many more. It is also honed that enough subscribers will be^ forthcoming in the town of MuEarrak to warrant running a trunk line across the sea. Until now only two applications have been received from Muharrak. Two rates are available to subscribers, one a flat rate of ks 150/- per annum and the other Rs 45/- per annum plus one anna a call of six minutes duration. The former is the most popular. “ Prosuects for 1352.— although it is difficult to make a forecast at present, it can reasonably be assumed that wiring, (with consequent additional load) will uroceed, if not faster, at the present rate, during 1352. It is also honed that tne sale of appliances will increase. Should the economic^situation become easier, then many more consumers v/ill come forward. There are enough notential consumers in Manamah and Muharrak to make the^ undertaking a good paying propo sition, but the universal cry is that they at present have no money. General.— The department carried put all the govt, car renairs as heretofore, and in addition to the wiring contracts in Manamah and Muharrax, carried out the wiring of the new olfices, etc. of tne Banrain Petroleum Co. at the Jebel Dukhan and v&gt;heir telephone system. A durbar was held in Manamah during the month of Shawaal 1351, in honour &lt;?f H.E.Shaikh Hamad and for three days t&amp;e town was illuminated spme 70G oxtra lights being erected on public and private buildings.Customs. The following report has been provided by Mr. C. C. L. DeCrenier, the Director of Customs. Report on the Customs and revenue collections for the year 1351 A.H.(6th May 1932 to 25th April 1933) In comparison with the Budget estimates the coir lections were.- Estimated Actual Budget head collections collection Remarks Customs &amp; Import Yard 6,57,000/- 5,41,952/- Vehicle Licenses .2,500/- 4,614/- Pearling Licenses 35,000/- 40,260/- Craft registrations 2,500/- 3,569/- Miscellaneous (Tobacco Tax) 3,000/- 4,491/- Rs 7,00,000/- 5,94,886/- Total ' deficiency Rs 1 ,05,114/- In regard to the above, the deficiency in the actual Customs receipts can be_attributed partly to the world trade depression (which has now reached an acute stage), and partly to the local effects of several pearling seasons when the local Taaiirs have been unatle to dispose of their stocks, or to collect the proceeds of their disposals. This may be partly their own fault, as the Taajirs, who had been enjoying considerable prosperity were warned that in future prices would rail; but the warning does not seem uo have been heeded, and consequently certam^local Taaiirs felt compelled to go as iar as^Baris to sell their pearls, where they met with varying success. Thus there is a very definite lack o^ ready money available for general trading. But the most important factor in Customs receipts has been the decline sale prices oi the staple commodities The following comparison should be oi the decline of in the whole- imported here, interest. rComparative statement of values of chief commodities.

Thus in 1350, nine ty-five steamers (of which eightytwo were British) dis charged here 4,52,250/packages; while in 1351, one hun dred and four steamers (of which ninetytwo were British) discharged here 3,38,881 packages, a^decrease by one quarter of the previous year’s quantity. Thus, the fall in the customs receipts is due to a decline in imuorts both in quantity and value. One interesting point to note is the degree to which, in the nast year, Japanese goods of all kinds have entered the local markets. _ iipart from one or two local Jewish traders who import in small but steadyn— n (i \mmi ©&lt;« * 3 - 64 steady quantities the superior Manchester cotton p 1 ? 0 ? goods, practically all piece goods now imuor- ted into Bahrain are of Japanese origin, bought ty local traders through their .agents in Bombay; bur ^nis enterprise extends over a wide a?©^e range includ ing cement, cycles and gramophones, and may go far ther even^ oo rice, motor cars and eggs! Also, Ohinese cigarettes have made their appearance, as well as Russian piece goods, matches and sugar. ... . d’he following comparison of the princinal commo dities imported should be of interest':- Commodity Unit Quantity Year 1350 value ix.V.

The marked decrease, however, in sugar and^tea may be accounted for by a ^ falling-off in the exp'ort trade in these two commodi- t) ties, for this exrfort trade accounted for the greater 'Dart of the imports, when the tea and sugar were expor ted hence to the mainland of xj^abia, and re-exported thence possibly to certain Persian ports, I am informed It appears that an almost prohibitive import duty is impose- on tea and sugar, which, supported by a strict /’ (1* patrol of the sea-coast, makes this Persian iirrnbrt , ( trade very difficult for the merchants; but of course this arrangement enures in favour of the well-known Russian trade agreement and assists the U.S.S.R. in exporting its^ tea and sugar into Persianterritories from the Uorth; and consequently the southern import suffers accordingly.-4- ^mother interesting point is the increase in the quantity oi^artificial silk piece goods here. These come almost entirely from Japan; and are reasonably good m quality, very cheat) in price and attractive in appearance. These goods have found a ready market nere and are particularly favoured for re-export to the mainland oi ^irabia, although for religious reasons J^e wearing of pure silk Roods is not approved there, ^.nas naturally followed that the trade in Manchester cooton^piece goods has relatively suffered; and this is an interesting fact to record in view of my repo rt on the l»cal piecegoods market of three years agoT The quantities of cereals and coffee are reasonably constant and mean that local merchants are buying against sales instead of, as_heretofore, accumulating large stocks in a speculative manner against the possible needs of the pearling season. For two years there has been no special B.I.S.iT.Goy rice steamer here from Calcutta, and the merchants 1 requirements are now brought forward by transhipment via Bombay. If we comuare actual receipts (as distinguished from Budget Estimates) for the past two years^ we shall find:- Comparison of receipts. Year 1350 1351. Steamers cargoes ..

This list was compiled with the Adviser's approval after very careful consideration, working upon the prin ciple of doin.^npthing to increase the cost’ to the public of food commodities. Later in the year, namely 4th Ramadhan 1351 (corresponding with 31st December' 1932) the rate of seven-and-a-half per cent upon these commo dities was further increased ho ten per cent, except upon alcoholic liquors and tobacco and its manufactured products, which were increased to fifteen per cent ad- valorem. ^ In regard to these increases, which were made with considerable reluctance, it is good to note that they were accepted by the mercantile community without any comment except perhaps a little surprise that they had not been imposed earlier; and. indeed, at the present time the importers are expecting that the rate of ten per cent a'd valorem will” be applied to imports of all kinds, as the necessity for raisingraising revenue is ^uite understood. It is however interesting to remark that the only comment on this change of duty came from a British firm whose imports are quite unimportant in value to the State, and. even so, such imports are for certain ’permitted* persons in a commodity which is admitted only by a special concession by H. E. the Ruler. The comment resolved itself into the suggestion that imports whose invoices were dated prior to the date of the change in duty should be admitted at the prior existing rates, accompanied with the curiously ingenugus state ment that such was the custom according to ’interna tional law T ! These changes in the rates of import duty explain why the total collections, above, of duty from steamers’ cargoes is larger in 1351 than in 1350; and same may be analysed thus:- Collections @ n tr rt Rs 2,50,346/- 23,833./- 16,118/- 4,103/- . rs 2,94,400/- If, however, the collections for the year 1351 had been all at the flat rate of five per cent ad valorem, this item of Rs 2,94,400/- would have been 2,75,662/-, a difference of Rs 18,738/- and it is this figure which enables one to form a just comparison between the two years. It will be remembered that the rate of 7^-% was m force for nine months, and the rates of ten per cent and fifteen per cent were in force for three months only; and they have produced an increase in the receipts of Rs 18,738/- only, a fact which seems to justify the ex pectation that the ten per cent rate might with fair ness be applied to all imports except tobacco etc., and alcoholic liquors, which I suggest could easily bear a duty of 25^ ad valorem. The changes in the rates of duty, howeverhave had a more marked effect in the case of collections upon postal parcels; the sum of ks 16,519/- is made up thus:- Collections @ TT tr rt - Rs 2,066/- - 8,500/- - 5,903/- 50/- -Rs 16,519/- If the flat rate of five per cent had been main tained, this figure would have'amounted to Rs 10,702/- only; but so marked a difference is to be expected, since articles of the luxury type are more likely io come here as parcels than as general cargo, Although the quantity of parcels have considerably decreased in the past year. The same remark may .justly apply to passengers’ baggage but it is not quire so pleasing to see a decrease in the collections for Export Duty which is cpllected upon dates and pearl shells. The inference is that less dates were'exported, which was to be expected, asas people in general, especially the poor, are consum ing* more dates and fish and much less imported meat than formerly. The decrease in the Import Yard collections is consistent with the decrease in the quantity of cargo imported. It vd 11 be remembered that in the year 1350 a sys tem of 'refunds” was initiated, under which the local importer was permitted to exercise an option in regard to his import* as to whether or not he might re-export it to the mainland ports of Arabia, on similar lines with the R.E. system, which is regulated by High Autho rity. Haying duly proved the re-export of^the import, the importer was granted a refund of the difference between the amount of duty nre-paid and two per cent ad- valorem. I am glad to report that the working of this Optional 1 system (as it became known).was very much appreciated by the merchants and it Y/as extensively used especially by' the Hindu community who otherwise were greatly hampered in their mainland trade. Unfortunately for the Customs, however, the work of checking the returns and making the refunds developed so considerably as to become a very definite and equally unremunera- tive section of the office work^ and to keen the refunds untodate has proved a difficult task especially when one remembers that the Customs staff is now reduced to a minimum. In view of this position, I have changed the working of the system so that the importer may exer cise his option as before, but pay only two per cent ab initio:‘ and it is hoped that tnis adjustment will very considerably reduce the amount of office v/ork involved in making refunds. Consequently there appears above a new heading named 'Re-Export' Duty which records the results of this recent adiustment. It might not be out of place here to mention that all these refunds were made by cheque, so that(l; records of the tran sactions might be more efficiently kept than by cash payments, and (2) to encourage the local mercnants uO use the services of the Eastern lank, Ltd.,. The usefulness of this optional system to the mercantile community is demonstrated by the fapt that the old R.E. system has now completely fallen into dis use; and there is no doubt at all in my mind that the merchants trading with the mainland are quite satis fied with the existing system in Bahrain and are content to carry on with it, in preference-te residing upon the mainland. The geographical position of the State oi Bahrain^ lends itself to the develonment oi a transit trade, Wiiich is effected by the oncarrying of steamers\ cargpes to the mainland oy native craft: and in my opinion it is most desirable to encourage this trade as much as pos sible, especially as this oncarrying creates so much work for local native craft and motor launches; its advantage to the merchant is the facility for despatch ing small quantities of goods to the mainland as occa sion offers, rather than the shipment there direct from India of large quantities, which could only be done bv firms having large capital and extensive storage capacity on the mainland. For this reason I believebelieve that anv effort at bringing cargo direct frcpui India to a mainland port will not prove successful in the long run; and T would hereremakk that the recent decision of rhe .ingle Persian Oil Co. at Abadan to send their small steamer T Khuzistan t to the mainland uorts to sell oil etc., is an error; since the Company will not sell any more oil than it does at present by transhipment in Bahrain, but, on the other hand will expose its steamer to extra working expense, and take,' away some employment from some mainland and local native craft. In my renort for 1350, I alluded to the difficult position existing here arising from the question of the direct transhipment of cargo in this port. The ppsition remained of minor importance for several years until several factors; mainly the growing self-consciousness of the Nejdy merchants, the high freight rates charged by the B.l.S.N.Co. Ltd., (which company has practically the monopoly of the India-Persian Gulf cargo traffic) and the falling prices of Indian commodities nptably cereals, made hhe Neidy merchants clpsely^consider the amount of the expenses they were paying, in view of the general business degression, on the cereals taken hence to the mainland ports. These expenses included the shipping expenses from India and the Bahrain expenses on re-export. In Bahrain the rate of Khanchia per bag had been fixed at three annas; but after carefully considering the position the Bahrain government decided to reduce this rate in regard to re-exported bag cargo to Rs 6/- per hundred bags. in attempt to force down the B#I. rates had pre viously been made bv a local Hindu merchant, who had brought here a ship-load of rice and sugar from Cal cutta in a Norwegian craft; but this action dia. nou lead to a general permanent reduction of freight rates by the Company. Probably with this fact in mind, a Karachi snipper of rice (whose shipments are sold onthe mainland on a commission basis only) demanded special rates from the B.I.S.N.Co. Ltd., under the threat that he would des patch all future shipments by native craft direct to the mainland, or possibly charter a special steamer^ for his own purchases. After considerable discussion and correspondence it was decided to affirm the right of the Bahrain government to^ collect^tw*? per cent ad valorem upon all cargo transhipped within the port limits; and the B.I.S.N.Co. made a gesture by reducing its freight rate temporarily in order to compete with a second special shipment of cargo from Calcutta to Bahrain arrangdtby above Hindu merchant. This ship ment came fonward*on s.s. n Fagervick n a Norwegian vessel which arrived here on 1st Raba al Thany 1351 (&lt;jrd Aug. 1932) with 24,176 packages of rice tea and colfee. In the meanwhile the Karachi shipper, najy Hassan bin Murzook. had promised H. B ; M T s Political -ageno that he would make no direct shipments ttience to the mainland of Arabi® in consideration oi a ieduction in the freight rate, and also if the Bahrain governmentgovernment would nermit his local agent to transhin his cargo within the rort of Bahrain^re-payment oi the two per cent duty, hrut without payment 01 the Import Yard charges leviable if the cargo were landed ashore. Since this arrangement did not aifect the right of tne Bahrain government to collect the 2/o duty upon a lf land cargo brought to this port, and was consistent with other collections pf duty upon cargo transhipped here by native craft, there was naturally no objection to the proposal; and no doubt the B.I.S.N.&amp;oy. were satisfied to secure their freightage on such cargo. However, while this understand A was being arranged, the s.s. Tt Ahme r i tT a ship of the Nema^i. line, was char- tered by certain interested persons, and laden with 15,339 packages for Bahrain, of which 6,938 packages were manifested for the mainland nort oi Oqair via Bahrain, and these packages were shipped partly by Haiy Hassan bin Marzuk, and partly by the Bombay rela tives of this man’s local -hgan^. ihe steamer arrived here on 27th Jamad al Thania 13^1 (27th jctooer 1932) under the command of a Certain R. Parcou, who declared that he had been specially chosen to command this ship on account of Ms long experience m seaman ship and mercantile negotiations; and he intended to land the Bahrain cargo here, and to. proceed to Oqair with the quantity^intended^for that port, and also to buoy the channel in the neighbourhood o. has fanura tor the benefit of future steamers going^xn that direction. It happened that there was no Agent for tms steamer in Banrain, and the government aid not sanction tne appointmenu of certain persons who were invited to work as Agents by the ship’s owners. raruuu wao *e ra:ilS here, his Bahrain cargo would not be permitted to oe landed. Some lengthy discussion followed during which the Commander of s.s. TT Ahmedi T ’ endeavoured to insist on what he urged were his righuS to land c^rgo here and to proceed on with cargo; and he wanted it to be inferred that he was especially chosen by some government authority for this vayag® particularly to mark the channel to Ras Tanura, and the name oi Captain Philby the Port Officer of Bombay was frequently mentioned. However the Bahrain government maintained its attitude so the ship proceeded to Ras xanura where it landed its mainland cargp and its Bahrain cargo, and after returning to Banrain to land coolis,^9ler^s etc. proceeded onwards to Busrehwhere it was said uo have another charter-party awaiting it. me ^ommancier had previously pointed out what heavy demurrage wpuld be payable on account of the shiMs delay m arriving at Busrah, and hinted that he believed his owners would hold tie Bahrain government responsiMe ^or the cost of such delay. These owners have, m tact, made, such a claim; but I understand they are not pressing it wisely enougn. The effect of this incident is quite satisfactory, fnr thfi authority of the Bahrain government m its ownown territority has been vindicated, and the evasive^ tactfeof the 'ie jdy merchants have been properly checker; considerable assistance to the 3.I.S.a.Co. has been rendered; and although this Company has at last red 1 its freight rates to a figure reasonably consistent with the'value of the imports having regard to the current degression, it is yet to be seen if this Con nany will reciprocate the assistance given them by 1 Bahrain government especially in the matter ox onn^ their steamers to a more convenient anchorage. The transhinments at sea within the port limits of cargo intended for the mainland proceed steadily and the merchants concerned pay their dues without i demur, and the local employment of native craft is ensured. I therefore consider myself justnied m reporting that the mainland trade will proceed ^te&amp;&lt; as lon^ as there is any such trade to be done, the i est factor in its favour being the regular weekly calling here of the upmail steamers, tnus enabling merchants concerned to replenish tneir stocks regul at a saving of considerable^sums in interest payabl on over due accounts in India if such consignments to come forward irregularly by sailing craft; anot factor is the local feeling of security m dealing witn the Bahrain customs. Thus, during the past year the 2f Q duty so collected has amounted to tts ld,bhd/-. The saving point is; how long will such transit trade continuer This is dpubtful. for pne pi the main reasons for the transhipment trade in rice, ana especially in piecegoods, was that the rates o: Import Duty levied on the mainland were very much less than the rates of Import Duty levied at Jeddah, the greatest port in the Kingdom of Saudia. It appears tp be . cheaper to bring goods from India to ^rabia via Bahrain than to import them via Jeddah; and this fact has creal a falling-off in the imparts into Jeddah with a corres ponding outcry from the interested merchants there. I understand now that H. M. King ikbdulaziz ibn ViQc« thp» rates oi Import Duty on the to the mainland. I During the difficulty of the above described . 1 • -^1 _• _L _• „ J 4- ‘L ^ 1 r*4- Vnr n O O-n rsTi H on P OThis year, 1*351^,is the second export to Sahrai37?ersia of grain ii It is said that tne reason for this ram m Persia dnd possibly the cue there upon exports; but tne export :s to this State still conti one in which^ the in bulk has failed. s was the lack of customs restrictions glltt thence of sheep and goats to this State still continues, though npt in so large a quantity as formerly. The collections upon live-stock for tne year 1350 were Rs 2,468/- but in 1351 these amounted to R$ 1,952/- only. In the year 1350, 1571 native craft visited this port of whicn 633 came from Persia; while in 1351, 1573 native craft came here of which only 445 were from Persia. The export trade in tea and sugar has correspondingly languished; and in this trade a steady* part was taken by the big sailing motor craft of the Shaikh of Tibben, which plied regularly between that port and Bahrain. Unfortunately for the Shaikh, during last winter his craft was burnt at sea and became a total loss, and it has not yet been replaced. Another check to this export trade was recently giv&amp;i by the capture on the high seas^ of a BehxsLn motor craft, which was suspected by the Persian patrols of smuggling goods and passengers out of Persia;, and I have heard that the captured crew were hanged m ]j detail at the various sea ports between Bushire and^ Bunder Abbas. In place of the Persian wheat, there has come forward a steadily increasing ouanxity of wheat from Iraq, which is cheaper than Indian rough wheat, and consequently the import of this latter commodity has also ceased.

For last year's pearling season 275 local craft registered as working on the r K_aammos system, and the majority of these did not pay their license dues before the Rakbah, but were permitted by me Deputy Ruler to give rT sanad Tt for payment of the dues after' several journeys out to the banks; two journeys Wl M fepensees interpreted were- 11 - as and when they chose. This loose arrangement was very unsatisfactory ? and created considerable unnecessary difficulty m the collection of the dues. 3o, as each sanad fell due for pjyment I proceeded to impound the craft concerned, until p:yment; and I am glad to report that I collected all the pearling license fees due to the State without having recourse to the courts at all. The permission to ive sanad, however, has created an unfortunate precedent ? which I fear will be resorted to again this year with its consequent trouble in collecting the dues which ought to have been prepaid before the rekba. Harbour lights . The institution of the large flight on the customs pier atManamah has worthily served its nuruose, and it is admitted to be of assistance to craft entering or leaying^the port at or after sunset, hdth this exuerience in mind, the oil lamp at the mast head at the Ifeharaq customhouse was rerlaced with an hundred-watt white electric light;^ and this light has proved to be of even greater benefit both to steamers and native craft than was at first hoped, for its range of vision is not interrupted by the date palms at Galalee, so that it can be^distinguished at some dis tance beyong the outer (white) buoy. I am informed that the light is especially useful to the pearling fleets; so^for that reaspn it is proposed to light it throughout the season instead of (as at present) half the month, and when steamers are expected or m port. The Manamah light ranks in.the Admiralty sailing directions as an ’occasional* light, i*e. ? one t 9 be^ lighted upon request; and since Bahrain is not m uhe direct line of Gulf traffic, it is well that it should direct line oi oun ^ra^nc, remain so; but 1 understand from navigating o^.dicers, and particularly from H.M.S.'Ormonde” that the existence of the two lights is a very definite help to ships enter ing the port after sunset m making a suitable.anchorage. The only other urgent improvement m the lighting of the port needed at present is the altering o^. the ^esu Spit'Buoy into a lighted buoy, and preferably a flash light. A suggestion has been made that a light should be put upon the Portuguese Port; but I do not.approve of this at present, as there are so many practical diifi- culties in the way of its efficient maintenance tnat it really would not be prudent to undertake the res ponsibility for such a light. It has sometimes been urged that the old beacon built uron the Has Zarwan by Mirza Ismail (the iirst B.I.3.N.Goy t s agent in Bahrain) and thus popularxy known as tne ’Gray Paul* beacon, should be li^, tne reason being that this.beacon, and tne ^est buoy and the Manamah Pier light are m transit, consequently this fact wopld enable a steamer at night quite readily to find a.safe_anchorage. But there is no need to urge this point since not iiye per.cent of the steamers using'this port enter it at night, and the suggestion is of very minor.importance compared with the need for a lighted West Spit Buoy.It is however a fact that an unofficial light has been put upon this beacon by The local B.I.3.i\ T . Coy’s agents on stormy nights, t&lt;D assist their lighters in making the Customs Pier, but the beacon was rebuilt by the Bahrain Government, and somewhat improved; (but I observed that quite recently it was broken up by a person acting upon outside orders) and I hear that the Persian Gulf Lighting Authority nropose to erect there a permanent light —Qmt I have not as yet heard that this has been sanctioned by the Bahrain Government^ General . It has to be remembered that while the total of the receipts for the past year has decreased, the quantity of work to be done has increased, espe cially clerical work in connection with refunds and statistics which have now reached a point of reasonb- able efficiency; there is actually as much clerical work in collecting a small amount of money as a large one. It may perhaps be said that since the collec tions have decreased, the staff should also decrease; but I suggest that this is a v/rong point of view to take, and it is better to keep together a trained staff, although its cost may increase a little each year owing to the annual increments in pay. It will be remembered that last year, all pay was cut by ten per cent, but I will not suggest this as a matter of merit, since it will be seen from above how the cost of the prime commodities has fallen so sharply, that actually the present rates of pay have a much larger purchasing power locally than three years ago. Thus, although the Customs receipts have fallen sharply, yet the cost of living has fallen quite as sharply; and if expenses are made to fall consistently, I suggest that the outlook for the future should not be too pessimistic.General. Shaikh Khalaf . During last summer Shaikh Khalaf left Bahrain on a lengthy visit to Eathemain where some of his family are living. Before he left he was sued in the Bahrain Court by a local pearl merchant who proved a claim against him for Rs 14,000/-. The Court insisted upon Shaikh IQialaf handing over title deeds for certain of his prouerty in Manamah sufficient to settle the claim, before leaving the country. If is not known when or whether he proposes to return. Traci Agitator . (Syed Saleh bin Syed Mehdi) A week or two before the death of Shaikh Isa a young Shia Iraqi named Syed Saleh bin Syed Mehdi des cribed on his passuort as a student, arrived in Bahrain from Kuwait where he was said to have been the guest of the Ruler. He stayed for one night with H. E. Shaikh Hamad and then became the guest of Khan Saheb Yusuf Kanoo. He was invited to address the Manamah club which is ostensibly now political. He made a long speech in which he referred to the English as wolves and the people of Bahrain as their prey. After Shaikh Isa f s death a large meeting was held under the auspices of the club in Khan Saheb Yusuf Kanoo T s building on the sea road. Various people spoke including school masters,and several young men recited poems commemorating the late Ruler. Syed Saleh bin Syed Mehdi also spoke. His speech was violently anti-English and his sentiments were not even disguised by metaphor. He stated among other things, that Jesus Christ had been crucified by the(General) the Jews, but Shaikh Isa hai'been morally crucified by the English. His speech was applauded by some of the audience including several of H. E. Shaikh Hamad’s nephews. On the following morning he was taken out to the mail boat which happened to be in the harbour and provided with a free ticket to another port. When he was in Bahrain, he openly abused not only the Government but both the Sunni and the Shia '^adis. It is said that this individual was recently imprisoned in Iraq for having made a seditious speech in the presence of His Majesty King Faizal. Dawasir . The town of Budeya is gradually being re-inhabited by members of the Dawasir tribe who returned one by one from Dhammam. Ahmed bin Abdullah, the son of the late Shaikh of the Dawasirs makes every effort to prevent his followers from returning to Bahrain. Unfortunately, owing to his influence with Shaikh bin Jeloi, several times during the year he has been able deliberately to cause misunderstandings between the Governor of Kassah and the Ruler of Bahrain.Miscellaneous. Local Industries . Boat building.— The slump in the pearl trade has affected the boat building industry very severely. Some years ago this was a thriving trade and Bahrain built motor launches and sailing craft were exuorted to various Gulf ports. The decline in boat building is partly due to there being so many second hand pearling boats for sale at abnormally low prices. Sail making.— Sailcloth is made on hand looms in two or three villages in the neighbourhood of Budeya. This trade still continues but is less profitable than it used to be owing to the fall in the cost of sailcloth. It was found that very serviceable 'Dhurries” could be made locally at a lower price than those previously imported from India. About 150 of these 'Dhurries' were recently made locally for the Bahrain Police. Eastern Bank . The new Eastern Bank was opened on 25th June 1932. H. E. Shaikh Hamad and a number of local merchants and notables attended the opening. The new Bank was built by an Iraqi contractor, it occupies a site on the sea side of the sea road west of the Customs Pie: and is built of stone and cement.1. Page 10 . line 2. Printer*e error.
