Dear Sir Hugh Q Please refer to my D.0. of 6th June 1932* In the course of a conversation which I had just now with the Sultan he has given me some further details as to his visit to India* 2* He proposes to leave Muscat in the first or second week of July for a couple of months. He has not yet decided on his itinerary, which he will let me know later, but mentioned Kashmere and Simla. He is anxious that his visit unofficial should be entirelyas otherwise it would involve him in expense and official ceremonies, while tahat he wants is a rest. I suppose if he visits Simla, as a matter of official courtesy he should see some of the officials up there, and perhaps the Viceroy? But I imagine that he can do this unofficially. I suppose that you will inform the Foreign and political Department demi-officially of His Highnesses proposed visit? 3. His Highness has made elaborate arrangements for the carrying on of the State Government during his absence, including a Council of representation composed of Sayid Hadir, Captain Alban, Saiyid Hamad, Saiyid Mahmud and Sheikh Zubeir. In metters of routine the political Agent will address them. In other matters His Highness direct.

The correspondence includes details of unofficial visits to India by the Sultan during the summer months of 1932, 1934 and 1935, including proposed itineraries and arrangements for the handling of state affairs in his absence. It also includes discussion of the Sultan's wish to import a machine gun into Bombay during one of his visits, for the purpose of having the weapon repaired and re-exported to Muscat.In addition, the correspondence briefly discusses the Sultan's proposed visits to Bagdad [Baghdad], Kuwait and Bahrain in August/September 1937, and his wish to visit the Viceroy in India later that same year. Despite its inclusion in the title, no mention is made of any plans for the Sultan to visit Europe during this period.The volume features the following principal correspondents: the Sultan of Muscat and Oman; the Political Agent and Consul, Muscat; the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; various officials of the Governments of India and Bombay. The Arabic language material consists of correspondence received by the Political Agent from the Sultan and his representatives.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Visits</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0003db#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
