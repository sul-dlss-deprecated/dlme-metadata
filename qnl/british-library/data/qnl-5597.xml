The Political Resident is sent one signed copy (i,e, signed by the Secretary of State as having been allowed) and three certified copies (3) the Political Resident returns one of the certified copies signed and dated by him. The Regulation is then printed in its final form and distributed in the normal way. It will be seen that in the two places where he is required to sign the Regulation the Political Resident may give the same date and it seems convenient that he should do so. The Secretary of State may or may not sign the date of allowance but it seems quite normal that his signature should be undated. $ 13 j)BAHREIN NOTICE. - - --The following Regulation made by the Political Resident in the ^Persian Gulf and allowed by His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs is published for general information. T. C ■ Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Bushire, /5 , 1938. King’s Regulation under Article 70 (6) of “ The Bahrein Order in Council, 1913.” No. / of 1938. Whereas the Bahrein Government Law, dated the 17th February, 1937, regarding Ownership of Immovable Property in Bahrein by Foreigners was made applicable by King’s Regulation No. 1 of 1937 to all persons to whom the Bahrein Order in Council, 1913, applies : And whereas the said Law has been amended by a Bahrein Government Amending Law dated the 29th September, 1938 (an2 English translation of which forms the Schedule to the present Regulation): 1. This Amending Law is hereby made applicable to all persons to whom the said Bahrein Order in Council, 1913, applies. 2. This Regulation may be cited as “ The Bahrein Property Law (Amending) Regulation, 1938.” Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Bushire 1938. Allowed : HALIFAX, His Britannic Majesty's Principal Secretary oj State for Foreign Affairs.Schedule. A Law to amend the Law regarding Ownership of Immovable Property in Bahrein by Foreigners. Whereas it is expedient to amend the existing Law regarding Owf^ahip of Immovable Property in Bahrein by Foreigners, dated the 17th P'ebruary, 19B7—6th Dul Haj 1355; Now it is hereby enacted and decreed that the following amend ments be made in the aforesaid Law :— 1. At the end of Article 3, after the words “Article 4” there shall be added the words “or Article 5, as the case may be.’’ 2. The following words, known as Article 5, shall be added :— “ If a foreigner, to whom the provisions of Article 3 apply, fails to submit a list of his property as required by Article 4, the Government of Bahrein may apply to the District Court for the valuation of the property with a view to its compulsory acquisition. In this case the District Court shall give notice to the owner of the property, who shall be permitted to appear; and it shall then determine the valuation of the property, and may adopt for its purpose such procedure as the Court shall deem just and appropriate in the circumstances.’’ Bahrein, September 29, 1938.I personally see no objection to the adoption of* the previous form (as in Regulation I of 1937). It seems to me simpler and in every way preferable. The Political Resident, however, may have considered this and seen some objection the grounds of which we have not here appreciated, I thinly therefore, that before communicating with the Foreign Office it might be better to wire to the Political Resident suggesting that 7 if he sees no objection the previous form should be followed and a revised draft submitted for allowance. As to the procedure ; the legal position being that the P,R. 'makes” the regulation, but that it has no effect until it is 'allowed', w dne would have expected that the material date would normally be the date on which the regulation is allowed, and that the various steps would be taken in the following sequence;— (1) That the P.R. should make the regulation: (2) Thai} he should^either:— (a) Send it in original to the Secretary of State (through this Office) for allowance, or (b) Send a copy asking to be informed if and when it is allowed; (3) That the Secretaiy of State should allow it # and either : (a) Return the original with his signature thereon duly dated, or (b) Send formal intimation of the allowance and the date thereof, %(4) That the P.R. should then'publish the regulation with an intimation of the fact and date of its allowance. It is obvious, however, that the above procedure takes no account of the possibility of the regulation having ^ become ineffective through the refusal of the Secretary of State to allow it, and it was no doubt in deference to the Secretary of State and in order to avoid the making of an ineffective regulation that the present^perhaps somewhat irregular procedure has apparently grown up without objection, whereunder the regulation is 'allowed” before being 'made,'-is in fact to all intents and purposes made with the previous consent of the Secretary of State, I understand the present practice to be more or less as follows (1) The P.R. sends to the S. of S. a draft of the regulation that he p ropose s to make, (2) The S. of S. allows it,and informs the P.R. of the fact by sending him a number of printed copies of the draft ^ of 'which one - subsequently to become the original regulation? - bears his own signature in manuscript / though still undated y and the others,, three of which are certified copies,bear his printed signature. (3) The P.R. then 'makes' the regulation by signing, dating and numbering the copy already signed by the S. of S v iml i it the Datte^ for purpose of record r one M^u^^-*-T 5 f^the certified copies similarly signed, dated and ^ numbered. (4) The P.R. then publishes the regulation in its completed form. It would naturally be convenient though perhaps/(4) perhaps not strictly necessary / that the date of the publication should be the same as that on which the regulation was ,, made w . I presume that there would be no serious objection to the above procedure being continued. -F 1MA» GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. DEPARTMENT. LETTER (AIR MAIL).

It has now been ascertained that the statement made in paragraph 2 of Residency Express Letter II0.572-S, dated the 3rd august 1937, that no Bahrainis are known to own real property in oaudi Arabia, is in correct, and the jrolitical ^gent, Bahrain, has confirmed that several Bahrain subjects do in fact own landed property in ^atif. Similarly, the statement in paragraph 2 of letter Bo #1149-9-A, dated the 17th ^ July 1939, from the Adviser to the Bahrain Government to the Political Agent, Bahrain, (enclosed with Sir Trenchard Bowie's letter Lo.C/288, dated the 2nd August 1939 to Lr. Peel), that no foreigner is allowed to purchase land or property in ... Lejd or Hasa except under special ' circumstances, has been found to be based on inaccurate information. Political Agent, Bahrain, reports that so far as can be discovered no Bahraini has recently attempted to acquire property in Saudi Arabia, but that during Ibn Baud’s recent visit to Bahrain the King gave a / garden2 5As (&amp;) garden on the mainland to Ahdullah 'bin Jaor, Secretary to the Shaikh of Bahrain, ho question, therefore, arises, of retalia tory legislation against Saudi Arabia. 3. In the case of Iraq, as no alterations have teen made since 1937 in the rights of foreigners to own property, Bahrainis, like other foreigners, cannot acquire more than one dwelling house. From the local point of view it would there fore appear preferable to utilise existing legislation to apply to Iraqis in Bahrain the same restrictions as affect Bahrainis in Iraq, rather than to enact fresh legislation of universal application. With regard, however, to the possibility of such action provoking resentment in Iraq, I am instructing the Political Agent to advise the Bahrain Government that the whole question should be left in abeyance for the duration of the war, which advice I have no doubt will be accepted. sd.

Dear Gibson, With reference to the correspondence ending with your official letter P.Z.6258/39 of the 13th October regarding the ownership of property in Bahrein by I foreigners, I enclose copies of a despatch from Bagdad and of a letter from Trott at Jedda, from which you will see that the rights of foreigners to own property in Iraq and Saudi Arabia have remained unchanged since 1937. 2* Both Newton and Trott deprecate the introduction of any property legislation in Bahrein which could be held to discriminate against Iraqi or Saudi Arabian nationals. If, therefore, the Bahrein Government consider it essential to introduce a law restricting the acquisition of land by foreigners, we would urge that such legislation should be • •'' y, * of an universal nature, as was suggested in paragraph 3 of my letter E 5843/53/91 of the 4th September.

Dear Baxter, Foreign Office printed despatch No. 244 (E 5843/53/91) dated September 5th transmits for our observations copies of corresoondence relating to the Bahrein la?/ on the ownership of land by foreigners. 2. I reported on this question in my despatch of June 12th, 1937, No. 113_( 928/227/4). No person not a Saudi subject is allowed to o?m real property in the Hejaz, but there is no restriction on the ownership of real property in other parts of Saudi Arabia. No complaint has ever been raised by a Bahraini in the Hejaz on this score, and it apnears probable that no person claiming Bahraini nationality is domiciled in the Hejaz. According to a letter addressed by the Political Resident Bushire to the Government of India on August,3rd, 1937, no Bahrain subjects are known to own real property in Saudi Arabia. It will be seen, then,that the disability of the foreigner to own land in Saudi Arabia only applies to part of Saudi Arabia, that apparently no Bahraini owns real property in those parts of Saudi Arabia where there is no restriction on ownership by foreigners, and that no Bahraini has a practical grievance on this account at present. C.W. Baxter, Esq., G.M.G. , M.G. , 3./ Foreign Office3. In view of the state of affairs described above, and of the necessity to maintain good relations with Ibn Saud at this difficult time, I endorse heartily the opinion expressed in the last paragraph of the letter addressed by Eyres to Gibson of the India Office on September 4th (No. 5843/53/91) and trust that the Bahrain Government will find it possible to postpone action in the matter in so far as it would affect subjects of Saudi Arabia.

POL, DEPt I OCT 1939 (Signature)j INDIA OFFICE (Designation)F.Z. 5998/39. CONFIDENTIAL. Extract from the Annual Report on Iran for the year 1938. Bahrein, Expulsions of Iranians . 26. In June the Iranian Government made vigorous oral representations following complaints about the treatment of Iranian subjects in Bahrein. It was made clear that these representations were without prejudice to the Iranian Government’s known attitude as regards the Sheikh and the position of His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom in Bahrein. It was alleged that in connexion with the nationality and property laws some 200 Iranian families were being expelled and some 500 to 600 persons imprisoned under atrocious conditions. As a contrast, reference was made to the ’’considerate” treatment which the Iranian Government were showing to the Berberis, whom they were expelling (paragraphs 47 to 52 of this report). The Iranian Government requested the good offices of His Majesty’s Government in this question as the latter were in such close relations to the Gheikh. 27. Enquiries were made by the Political Resident, at the request of His Majesty’s Legation, as a result of which it transpired that the action which had been taken in Bahrein had nothing to do with the Bahrein Nationality and Property Law, but had been taken under a King's Regulation of 1937, which provided for the expulsion of all foreigners entering Bahrein without valid travel papers. It was explained that the application of this Regulation had in practice been restricted to indigents with whom Bahrein had been flooded. One/One hundred and forty-four Iranians had “been tried, and of these 104 had been deported. Five foreigners of other than Iranian nationality had also been deported. The Political Agent at Bahrein categorically denied the allegation of harsh treatment. The above information was duly communicated to the Iranian Government, who were assured that the expulsions had been concluded unless the number of indigents were to increase again. 23. No further expulsions were reported, and the Iranian Government let the matter drop. The question was not given any publicity in the vernacular press. One interesting feature of the episode was that it marked a change in the attitude hitherto adopted by the Iranian Government towards Bahrein. Though they were careful to maintain orally Iran’s claim to sovereignty, and though their approach only amounted to enlisting the good offices of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, the fact that diplomatic action was taken amounted in practice to a de facto admission of His Majesty’s Government’s position in Bahrein. 29. Another oral complaint concerning Bahrein was to the effect that the children born in Bahrein of persons whom the Bahrein authorities recognised as Iranians were not being allowed to attend the Iranian scnools there. After enquiries had been made, it was explained that such a grievance did not exist, since while it was true that boys regarded as Bahreini nationals were not allowed to attend foreign schools, Iranian parents could easily get round the rule, as they were specifically entitled to register their sons as Iranians within two years of their birth.3 f V it fa Register No. P.Z Ui T /*?

Mr. Gibson, Mr. Peel, Please refer to the minutes at P.Z.5393/37 and 5949/37• The position of Iraq, and Saudi Arabia vis—a—vis Bahrein under the Property Law of 1937 has been discussed once already although in a different connectionjvide Foreign Office d.o. letter dated 5tu May 1937 (P.Z.3070/37 and connected correspondence)! This discussion was concluded with Foreign Office letter dated 7th September 1937 (P.Z.549/37). The original object of this Lav/ v/as retaliation. Nominally it was aimed at all Governments prohibiting T'V.oJ the ownership of ihipq- 1 property by Bahreini nationals living abroad, cf. Article I. Actually it was aimed ^ againe-t Iran. Under Article II the Bahrein Government v/as to notify Governments which v/ere effootlyc and ultimately Iran was the only Government so notified. (P.Z.7806/37). The suggestion that Iraq and Saudi Arabia should also be notified came from the Foreign Office wfoi-eh were anxious to avoid if possible any appearance of discrimination against Iran. The suggestion was finally dropped in accordance with the wishes of the Bahrein Government at the time on the round that these two did not fulfil the conditions of the law. It v/as ascertained that Property Lav/s existed in Iraq and Saudi Arabia, out Bahrein seemed satisfied that so far as their nationalo were concerned the practical ^plication of these lawswas negligible The present suggestion of the Bahrein Government that they should extend the application of the Property Law to Iraqi and Saudi nationals living in Bahrein ^presumably by notification in Article IIis not really concerned with retaliation. Its purpose is simply restriction of the amount of Bahrein property held by foreigners ) which has apparently been increasing. Most of these foreigners are said to be Saudis or Iraqhis* Under Article II take^ the form of a retaliatory measure and Bahrein are therefore anxious to make certain that corresponding Property Laws are actually in effect in Iraq and Saudi Arabia. They enquire whether the Reposition is the same as it was in 1937 (cf. Mr. Clauson’s letter dated 28th May 1937 P.Z.3070/37). A reference to the Foreign Office on this point is necessary. It is difficult to see how Bahrein could, two years after the promulgation of the Property Law^notify Iraq and Saudi Arabia under Article II without causing resentment unless evidence is forthcoming of an increasing rigour in the restrictions placed upon Bahreinis in those two countries. As regards Saudi Arabia at least such evidence is most unlikely to be forthcoming since.contrary to the awL^iooion in paragraph 4 of Mr. Belgrave T s letter of 17th July^the Saudi restrictions^/apply only to the Hejaj and not to the and in 1937 only one Bahreini dorriciled in the HejaM was known to His Majesty’s Legation at Jedda (P. Z. 4593/37). Nor is Ibn likely to be pleased at the imposition of property restrictions on his nationals domiciled in a land which belonged to his ancestors. Since the Saudi Government will probably resent the actior/(E 5843/53/91) FOR SIGN OFFICE, S.W.l. — ' 4th September, 1939 Dear Gibson, With reference to your official letter P.Z. 4981/39 of the 18th August, regarding the ownership of property in Bahrein by foreigners, I write to say that the position in Iraq and Saudi Arabia is, so far as we know, as stated in paragraph 3 of Fowle f s letter to Peel, No. C/288 of the 2nd August. We cannot say for certain, however, without reference to Bagdad and Jedda, to whom we are sending copies of this correspondence for their observations. 2. We see no objection in principle to the enactment of legislation by the Bahrein Government forbidding or limiting the acquisition of property in Bahrein by foreigners generally. At the same time we would prefer that at this moment of all moments the Bahrein Government should defer taking action which, however legitimate and justifiable in itself, may inevitably give rise to some complaint in Saudi Arabia and Iraq. 3. A further point which I suggest should be considered is whether fresh legislation is required at all. I RECd. POL. DEPt If/ J.P. Gibson, Esq IND'A offc:21 If Saudi Arabia and Iraq in fact restrict the holding of property by foreigners, or certain classes of foreigners which include Bahreinis, can the Bahrein Government not simply 'notify' these countries under the Law of the l?th February, 1937, (which incidentally is not exactly 'legislation affecting Persia' in the sense of affecting Persia alone) as has already been done in the case of Persia? If, on the other hand, either Saudi Arabia or Iraq fails to impose the necessary restrictions on foreigners or at any rate on Bahreinis, and it is important to restrict the ownership of property by Saudi or Iraqi nationals, as the case may be, special legislation may be necessary. This legislation could clearly not be aimed at Saudi and Iraqi nationals alone, as the Bahrein Government seem to contemplate. It would have to be universal. In fact, from our point of view universal legislation would in many ways be preferable at the present jucture to 'notification' of either Saudi Arabia or Iraq under the existing legislation. 4. This is, in the circumstances of today, only a hurried line. I have not had time to go into the question thoroughly, but we do think it important that the Bahrein Government/Government should avoid any action likely to give rise to a wrangle with the Saudi Arabian or Iraqi Governments just now. Yours sincerely,BAHREIN. NOTICE.

It is hereby enacted and decreed that foreigners in Bahrein whose Governments prohibit in their respective territories the ownership of immovable property by persons other than their own m*Monals, may be prohibited from owning such property in Bahrein, w .jther in their own name or in the name of any other person for their benefit, except within the limits required for their residence, trade or craft. 2. The Bahrein Government may from time to time notify the Governments whose nationals in Bahrein will be subject to the prohibition laid down in Article 1, and such prohibition will have effect from the date on which the notification in question has been published by the Political Agency in Bahrein. B. A foreigner who is a national of a Government which has been notified under Article 2 and who already, at the date of publica tion of the notice, owns immovable property covered by the provisions of Article 1, may continue to own it for one year from that date. At any time after the expiry of one year the Bahrein Government may compulsorily acquire the property or may put it up for sale, but the price to be received, in either event, by the owner shall not be less than the sum determined by the valuation prescribed in Article 4. 4. Within three months of the date of the notification laid down in Article 2, every foreigner to whom the provisions of Article B apply shall submit to the District Court a list of such immovable property. A copy of the list shall be given to the Bahrein Govern ment, which may thereafter appoint an assessor. The owner shall, in that event, have the right also to appoint an assessor. The assessor, or the assessors jointly, shall assess the value of the said property and shall make a report to the District Court. Should the assessors fail to agree, the District Court shall appoint a third assessor whose decision shall be final. The District Court may determine in each case the period within which the assessment shall be completed. The cost of the valuation shall be paid by the owner of the property.

With regard to Iraq it would appear from paragraph 2 of Bagdad despatch flo,286, dated the 14th July 1937, to the Foreign Office, that such ownership is restricted to one dwelling house, xn re^rd to Saudi Arabia please see paragraph 9 of foreign Office despatch Bo,S 1885/ 30/91* dated the 5th May 1937, to the India Office, 1 gather from this that except in the Bejas, Bahrainis, though foreign- era, can own land in Jfejd.

Dalrymple Belgrave, Esquire* Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, Persian Gulf. To Hie Britannic Majesty*a Political Agent, Bahrain, Persian Gulf. Sir, I have the honour to inform you that the Bahrain Governmenl is concerned by the fact that a great proportion of the most valuable land property in Bahrain, especially in Manama, is in the hands of foreigners who acquired it in the past by purchase. 2. necent legislation affecting Iranians has restricted own ership by Iranians to their residences and places of work. Other nationalities who have acquired much property in the past and who a re continuing to buy land are .‘Saudi Arabians and, to a lesser extent, Iraqis, the letter are mostly Jews. 3. The Bahrain Government understands, from unofficial enqui ries which have been made, that no foreigner is allowed to purchase land or property in Iraq or in Najd or Hassa, except under special circumstances by permission of the respective Governments. It therefore follows that Bahrain subjects cannot buy land or house property in those eount^Pes although there is no such restriction against nationaxs oi unose countries purenasing property in Bahrain. 4. The Bahrain Government is considering die advisability of adopting reciprocal measures in Bahrain uy means ox a l*w for blading Bahrain subjects to sa&amp;l land Iraqis or .^audi Arabians, but before any further discufitions take place I shoula be grateful if &gt;ou would com inn t.q\e fact that a law exists in Iraq, Hassa and hajd forbidding foreign***® ‘to pur chase property. 1 understand that this law uoes not app y ‘to the Kejaz because it would oe contrary to -the principles pj v inc iple s/- 2 - / r\ c ' 4 f Jb a b inclplea governing lend ownership itithe Holy Cities* I have the honour to he, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Sd* C• Dalrymple Eelgreve, Adviser to the GovernmentBAHREIN NOTICE.

SECRET. 4128/38 POLITICAL DEPARTMENT.Minute Paper. political Department. 4.-3- fz .s^jsv 'zy 4795 5000 5/36 The Bahrein Government have asked for an interpretation of the following point in connection with the Law regarding ownership of Immovable Property in Bahrein the terms of which were approved at P.Z.7420/36 (Flag A). . A. Under Article 3 of the Lav/ (which was promulgated on 8th May 1937) the Bahrein Government may compulsorily acquire the property of a foreigner belonging to a State which has been ,, Notified ,, in accordance with Article 2, but the price to be received by the owner may not be less than the sum determined by the procedure described in Article 4. Article 4 requires that, within 3 months of the date of the foreign country being notified, every foreigner who is a subject of that country shall submit a list of his immovable property to the District Court (i.e. to the local Political Agent). Thereafter the Bahrein Government appoint an assessor and the owner may do likewise, and in case of disagreement between them the District Court appoints his own assessor to give a final decision. The Iranian Government v/as notified (in accordance with the procedure prescribed in Article 2) on 1st November 1937 and the ,f 3 months' expired on 31st January. By that date however only one Iranian National had submitted a list of property and there remain a number of Resident Property owners who do not propose either to acquire Bahrein Nationality or to submit lists of property. There are also some big Iranian property ov/ners who do not reside in Bahrein and none of these have sent in lists either. Unfortuhately the lav/, as it stands at present^appears to be defective in that it contains no provision for the action to be taken if such lists are not submitted/L . i. * P.Z.2748/38 * See letters at P.Z.1972/38 and P.Z.4128/38. submitted and it^therefore necessary to consider what advice should he given to the Bahrein Government. 3. Two courses have heen proposed viz:- (a) On the one hand the Government of India* seem prepared to let the law work as it stands, without proposing, in the cases where Article 4 does not operate through the non-submission of lists of property, to provide any directions as to the scales or method of calculation of the compensation to be given for the compulsory acquisition of property. (b) On the other hand the Foreign Office suggest that the proper course is to publish a new King’s Regulation embodying an amendment to the Property Law on the following lines:- At the end of Article 3; after the words ’’Article 4” add the v/ords ’’or Article 5 as the case may be*' and add a new Article 5 as follows: ”If a foreigner to whom the provisions of ’’Article 3 apply fails to submit a list of his ^property as required by Article 4, the Bahrein ’’Government may apply to the District Court for ’’the valuation of the property with a view to ’’its compulsory acquisition. In this case the ’’District Court shall give notice to the owner ”of the property, who shall be permitted to ’’appear, and shall then determine the valuation ”of the property; and may adopt for its ’’purpose such procedure as the Court shall deem ’’just and appropriate in the circumstances”. 4. The local Political* Authorities would prefer * see P.Z.3388/38 to see the Government of India’s view adopted, as being the more convenient course and avoiding the delay of amending the law and issuing a fresh King’s Regulation; but we feel doubtful here (and the Foreign Office agree) v/hether as a matter of construction the Government of India’s solution can be derived from the language of the Property Law, and even if it could it would seem open to objection on the ground that no guidance is given as to whether any compensation at all is payable, fln the point of construction please see the Legal Adviser’s Note of 20th May (Flag C) • 5/Minute Paper Department — 3— 5. In support of course ('b) the Foreign Office consider that apart from the question of the legal interpretation, it is desirable, in order to avoid confusion in the future, that a new King’s Regulation should he published embodying an amendment of the lav/ which makes the position absolutely clear for those who are likely to be affected. Otherwise an Iranian subject who had not complied with the provisions of the Law might have some justification for complaining, if his property were disposed of in the manner suggested by the Government of India, on the ground that it was not stated that a particular penalty, or indeed any penalty, was involved. They point out, moreover, that it is most desirable to avoid giving the Iranian Government any presentable course of complain or during anything which might lead to further difficulties with them. On general grounds the Foreign Office view seems preferable to that suggested by the Government of India and it is therefore proposed to authorise the Political Resident, if the Government of India see no objection, to move the Bahrein Government to enact an amending Law on the lines indicated in paragraph 3(b) above. This should not involve much delay and the final act viz. the issue of a fresh King’s Regulation can be dealt with expeditiously. A draft letter to the Political Resident in the above sense is submitted for approval. |/VA 21 IK 4795 5000 5/36Draft Paper. Department. Draft Expre ss Letter.

On general grounds it seems preferablt to regularise position in manner proposed in Foreign Office letter dated 21st March and provided that Government of India concur, you should at once explain matters to Bahrein Gover ment and obtain Sheikh^ signature to an Amending Law on the lines suggested. As in the case of the original Law it is desirable that the Amending Law and the necessary King’s Regulation should be published simultan ly. If you agree please arrange accordingly and submit Draft King’s Regulation with your reply. 3. Above procedure should not take long to carry through and since in any case Bahrein Government cannot actually ”acquire' property until after 1st November next it is assumed (with reference to paragraph 5 of Foreign Office letter dated 13th June) that no action will be taken until/My dear Gibson, Many thanks for your letter P.Z.3388/38 of the 24th May about the law governing the ownership of property in Bahrein by foreigners. 2. We agree generally with the views expressed in your letter and with the opinion of your Legal Adviser on the interpretation of the law. It seems to us doubtful whether the solution suggested by the Government of India is tenable on a strict interpretation of the text. 3. But leaving the question of legal interpretation apart, we feel that it is in any case desirable, in order to avoid confusion in the future, that a new King’s Regulation should be published embodying an amendment which makes the position absolutely clear for those who are likely to be affected. Otherwise a Persian subject who/ J.P.Gibson Esq. - ^ 14 JUN 1938 INDIA OFFICE J Iwho had not complied with the provisions of Article 4 might have some justification for complaining, if his property were disposed of in the manner suggested by IMla, Afofc 3 Lwrtf fc* BcJintAJ* toy*** IU\ ^ l&amp;frJV’' tylj. llfrU^r* . lfckL~ cu^ (*. iwulzo tU.- . ^ h ^ g^..

Moreover, as indicated in paragraph 6 of my letter of the 21st March, it seems most desirable to avoid giving the Persian Government any presentable cause of complaint or doing anything which might lead to further difficulties with them. 5. He feel, therefore, that the very least that is required is that if the Bahrein Government do move ex parte , they should do so in the sense of putting the assessment procedure into motion of their own volition and should only put the property up for sale, or acquire it at their own valuation, without carrying the assessment procedure through, in the event of the owner concerned failing to appoint an assessor.

A' 4 t t &gt; / w Tlx® Hahrain Property Law is a retaliatory measure and presumably treats the Iranians in the same way as the Iranians treat the foreigners. 2. On the publication of the notification declaring that the nationals of Iran are prohibited from owning immoveable property in Bahrain such nationals would automatically come under the ban. But they are under Article 3 given one year*s grace and thereafter their property is liable to be compulsorily acquired or put up for .aale by uhe Bahrain Government, fha amount of compensation to be jjaid for such compulsory acquisition or sale is however not to fell short of the amount to be fixed under Article 4. If the foreigner concerned omits to take the requisite steps mentioned in article 4 mi for the valuation of the property the result would be that there would be no 'sum determined by the valuation prescribed by article 4' and consequently the /compensation payable will be subject to minimum. The foreigner cannot by his own inaction render uhe law i^ope- h) lie ZutTt&amp;uf 1*&gt; h VU^‘ dVKAAvPQ t rative* 3. The procedure, therefore, uo be adopted in the event of a foreign national of a notified country failing to take mi action under /article 4 within the prescribed time will not be that of proceeding r:^rte under that Ar ticle- for wxach there is no provision - but that of proceeding ^ compulsory acquisition or sale under rticle 3 as if there were^minimum sum payable as compensation. Tno owner,- or rather the person who used to be the owner - will, there upon, be entitled, if the property is x^ut to sale, to only the actual price realised at the sale or, if the px-operty is compulsorily acquired, to only such compensation as is considered reasonable, and no more.ft-s. - ' &amp; (-3 1069/14/91) ' fp: z. | 1 9 7 2 j 1933 l FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l, 2lst March, 1958. ?« My dear Gibson, ^ Under cover of India Office letter No.P.Z.1236/38 C) i i. „ O/ /.f' rri It of 24th February we received a copy of Fowle's letter D.O.No.C/56 of 15th February to Metcalfe about the operation of the Bahreini Nationality Law and the Law governing the ownership of property in Bahrein by foreigners. We have the following observations to offer on the points raised. 2. In the first place, in paragraphs 3 (a) and (b) Fowle uses such phrases as 'to obtain Persian 'nationality' and 'to retain their Persian nationality'. Again in paragraph 6 appears the ohrase 'obtaining 'Persian nationality'. But it is Persian Law and not Bahreini law which regulates Persian nationality, although the 'master nationality' rule prevents Persian nationality being invoked in Bahrein by a person who possesses dual Bahrein and Persian nationality. It would therefore be more J.P. Gibson, Esq. J i Amore correct in the paragraphs referred to to refer to ,f the right (under Article 2 of the Nationality Lav/) to “avoid the acquisition of Bahrein nationality''. 3. As regards the two classes of Persian nationals to which powle refers in paragraph 3 of his letter we are for the purposes of this letter only concerned with those in category (b) i.e. those who fail to register their property as required by Article 4 of the Property Law. As regards this class, the law is now seen to be defective in that it does not provide very clearly v/hat is to happen if a person who should register his property fails to do so. One reading, which is a possible one, is that the words “in that event' in the 3rd sentence of Article 4 (line 7) mean that the owner has only the right to appoint an assessor if he has subraitted a list; but unfortunately, as Article 4 is drafted, the Bahrein Government also only gets the right to appoint an assessor after a list has been filed. It seems necessary therefore to have a new article (which in turn will necessitate a fresh King’s Regulation as well) in order to fill the gap in the law. 4. We4. ;7e suggest therefore that an amending lav/ he enacted on the following lines: 5. At the end of Article 3; after the words •’Article 4” add the v/ords ”or Article 5 as the case may ”he' and add a new Article 5 - as follows: ”If a foreigner to v/hom the provisions of ’’Article 3 apply fails to submit a list of his ’’property as required by Article 4, the Bahrein •'Government may apply to the District Court for 'the valuation of the property with a view to its 'compulsory acquisition. In this case the 'District Court shall give notice to the ov/ner of 'the property, who shall be permitted to appear, 'and shall then determine the valuation of the 'property; and may adopt for its purpose such 'procedure as the Court shall deem just and 'appropriate in the circumstances'. 6. Under this text the District Court could in fact still allow the ov/ner to appoint an assessor, as in Article 4, and it may be, in many cases, best that it should do so, as v/e want to go a long way to avoid any reasonable ground of complaint; but it will not do to provide in terms that a man who does not obey the law and register his property is still just as well off as a man who does. Moreover, even if this amending legislation takes time to effect we think that the District Court should in practice so deal with the matter in the meanwhile i.e. should in general give a man whose property is to be confiscated a chance of appointing an assessor unlessunless there is something very much against him. There is just one other point to which it is necessary to draw attention. In the English text of the Property Lav/ which formed an enclosure to the Political Resident’s Express letter Ho. 0/253 of 24th September 19o7 to the Government of India (a copy was sent to us in India Office letter P.Z. 6717/37 of 14th October 1937) the words '-benefit, except within the limits required for 'their” are omitted between the words 'their' and reo-i^.ence in Article l. it might be as well to ensure that there was no corresponding omission in the official Arabic text.British Legation ^-87 [m+'i'l'boj'll) * n ——-4Q?

Therefore, while protesting against such measures whioh ave definitely not been taken without the knowledge of the British Government and whicth are entirely incompatible with the right of sovereignty of Tran in respect of those islands, I have the honour to inform you that t cse measures cannot in any way affect the legitimate rights of th- Imperial Government in Si e Bahrein islands or be considered as proof that artirein is an independent State or that the British Government have special rights there.

We can now authorise the Political Resident (provided the Government of India agree) to tell the Bahrein Government that they may issue the proposed Notification applying the provisions of the Property Law to Persian nationals. 3. Although there appears to be no objection to adding the stipulation made in para.3, the Foreign Office appear to be unnecessarily nervous about Persian reactions. Any Persian complaint about discrimination would be tantamount to recognition of the Bahrein Law and it seems hardly likely that they would take any action which would compromise theii^ claim to sovereignty over Bahrein. If, on the other hand, their complaint followed the usual lines that the Bahrein Government have no power to make laws (particularly those directed against Persian subjects) it should not be difficult to deal with such a complaint on its merits.mm/mm Draft Paper, P.

M. J CTLADWBTi957 Your letter P.Z.5593/37 of the 2nd September on the subject of the new Bahrain Law respecting the ownership of real property by foreigners. 2. We concur in your proposal to authorise the Political Resident to inform the Bahrain Government that there is now no objection to their 'notifying** the Persian Government. 3. But we still feel obliged to stipulate that in the event (not necessarily very probable) of the Persian Government complaining of discrimination as between Persia and other countries, their complaint will have to be examined and dealt with on its merits. As regards Saudi Arabia, I think we could show that the question of discrimination did not arise, if only because foreigners may apparently own property in Nejd; but as regards Iraq, I think our task might be rather harder. The fact that the/ M.J. Clauson, Esq. RECO. POL DEPT. 8 SEP 1057: INDin ,rTlCEthe Bahrains in Iraq, have not as yet encountered any difficulties is certainly hopeful, but this is possibly because the Iraqi authorities regard them as Iraqi subjects. The effect of a Persian complaint following upon the M notification M of Persia in Bahrain might in fact be to create difficulties for these people where none existed before. 4. If you are telegraphing your instructions to the Political Resident could you so frame the telegram as to enable you to repeat it to Tehran to whom we are sending a copy of Fowle's express letter by next bag. Yours ever,3./ P.Z. 5393/37. Minute Paper. political Department. For the reasons given in Mr.Baggallay’s letter of the 5th May at P.Z.3070/37 (Flag A) no steps have yet been taken to publish the proposed Notification applying the provisions of the new Bahrein Property Law to Iranian subjects. In the meantime the Foreign Office have obtained the views of the British representatives at Jedda (see P.Z. 4393/37, Flag B) and Bagdad (see P.Z.5107/ 37, Flag C), and we now have the Political Resident's express letter at P.Z.5393/37 (Flag D). 2. Briefly the position appears to be as follows:- Saudi Arabia . (a) Foreigners (not even Muslims) may not acquire or own real property in the Hejaz (except that a Muslim foreigner may acquire such property for the purpose of converting it into a 'Waqf'). These restrictions do not, however, apply in other parts of Saudi Arabia. (b) No Bahreini subjects are known to own real property in Saudi Arabia, but there are a number of Saudi subjects in Bahrein who own real property, and who would be seriously affected should Saudi Arabia be 'notified” under the Property Law. Iraq . (a) Foreigners may not acquire real property without the permission of the Minister of the Interior which is not, however, as a rule withheld when the property is required for some legitimate purpose and is situated within the limits of a town or village. (b) A few Bahreini subjects own property in Iraq without let or hindrance, and it may be inferred (from the lack of information on the point) that no Iraqis own property in Bahrein.3. The question now arises whether in the light of* the information available^H .M. G. would be justified in acquiescing in the enforcement of the property law against Iranian subjects only. This seems more a question for decision by the Foreign Office, but it is significant that the Bahrein Government apparently consider that the Governments of Saudi Arabia and Iraq do not fulfil the conditions of the Property Law and tnat they do not desire to notify those Governments. In this they are supported by the Political Agent and the Political Resident. It is also of interest to note that neither the Minister at Jedda nor the Ambassador at Bagdad appear to be anxious that the Governments to which they are accredited should be 'notified'’. 4. In the circumstances it is suggested that we should now send the Resident’s express letter to the foreign Office, and say that^if they agree it is proposed to authorise the Resident to inform the Bahrein Government that there is no objection to their publishing the proposed Notification applying the Property Law to Iranian nationals. 5. A draft d.o. letter to Mr.Baggallay is submitted accordingly.Draft Paper. , b °iyl p political Department.

We are in general agreement with the views expressed therein and propose, if 4piit the Foreign Office agree, to the Resident to inform the Bahrein Government that there is^/no objection to their publishing the proposed Notification under Article 2 of the Bahrein Property Law applying to nationals of Iran the prohibition mentioned in Article 1 of the Law.Political Agent, Banrain, reports tnat tnere axe a numDer oi Saudi subjects in Banrain wno would be seriously ailectea snould Saudi Arabia be ’•notiiied** under the Banrain Property Law« ae is 01 opinion tnat tne Governments or saudi Arabia and Iraq do not i'uilil tne conditions oi tne Bahrain Law (as tne Government or Iran does), and in view or tnis, and of the fact that tne Bahrain Government themselves do not desire to 'notify' these two Governments, ne considers tnat it would be impolitic to do so* I concur in Captain hicKinbotnam^s opinion, and as nearly three months nave elapsed since tne publication or tne Property law I request that I may be authorised to inform the Bahrain Government that tnere is no objection to tneir publish ing tne proposed iM'otii ioation under Article 2 of the Law, applying to nationals or Iran tne prohibition mentioned in Article 1 or tne law* sd, i‘*C«Fowle.

Your Excellency, I have just been informe'd that .measures have again been taken in the Bahrein Islands which are in formal contra diction with Iran’s sovereign rights over those Islands. • Recently Iranians not in possession of a visa from the British Consuls have been forbidden to enter the Bahrein Islands, and a law has just been issued on nationality and another on the right of foreigners to acquire landed property. In view of the foregoing, while protesting against such measures, which are incompatible with Iran’s sovereign rights over the Bahrein Islands, I have the honour to inform your Excellency that these measures - which were no doubt not taken-without the United Kingdom Government’s knowledge, as is shown indeed by the actual text of the Law on Nationality cannot in any case affect the legitimate rights of the Imperial Iranian Government over those Islands, or constitute a proof either that Bahrein is to be regarded as an indepen dent otate or that the United Kingdom Government possesses special advantages therein. A copy of the present letter will be communicated to the League of Nations for information. I have the honour to be, etc. (Signed) SAMIY Minister of Foreign Affairs.

Law regarding Ownership of Immovable Property in Bahrein by Foreigners. 1. It is hereby enacted and decreed that foreigners in Bahrein whose Governments prohibit in their respective territories the ownership of immovable property by persons other than their own ^^Hpnals, may be prohibited from owning such property in Bahrein, wither in their own name or in the name of any other person for their benefit, except within the limits required for their residence, trade or craft. 2. The Bahrein Government may from time to time notify the Governments whose nationals in Bahrein will be subject to the prohibition laid down in Article 1, and such prohibition will have effect from the date on which the notification in question has been published by the Political Agency in Bahrein. 3. A foreigner who is a national of a Government which has been notified under Article 2 and who already, at the date of publica tion of the notice, owns immovable property covered by the provisions of Article 1, may continue to own it for one y ear from that date. At any time after the expiry of one year the Bahrein Government may compulsorily acquire the property or may put it up for sale, but the price to be received, in either event, by the owner shall not be less than the sum determined by the valuation prescribed in Article 4. 4. Within three months of the date of the notification laid down in Article 2, every foreigner to whom the provisions of Article 3 apply shall submit to the District Court a list of such immovable property. A copy of the list shall be given to the Bahrein Govern ment, which may thereafter appoint an assessor. The owner shall, in that event, have the right also to appoint an assessor. The assessor, or the assessors jointly, shall assess the value of the said property and shall make a report to the District Court. Should the assessors fail to agree, the District Court shall appoint a third assessor whose decision shall be final. The District Court may determine in each case the period within which the assessment shall be completed. The cost of the valuation shall be paid by the owner of the property.

I am directed Ly the Secretary of State for India to 1 orward for the information of the Secretary of State ior Foreign Affairs, a copy of an Express Letter from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, regarding the disposal of the fees levied in accordance with Article 3 of the Bahrein (Amendment) Order in Council, 1937. 2. The Marquess of Zetland presumes that some direction should now he given to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf regarding the deduction of a certain percentage of the fees levied, and that the concurrence of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury in the terms of this direction should he obtained. No information is available which would enable His Lordship to calculate the actual percentage which it will be necessary to deduct in order to cover the cost of administration; nor does it appear that such a calculation would in any case be possible except in the light of experience. He would accordingly suggest for the consideration of Mr. Secretary Eden.that Their Lordships should be invited to concur in the issue of a direction to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to the effect that he should deduct such percentage of the fees as may from time to time be required for meeting the expenses of administration, such as the payment of any extra personnel in the Political Agency, and that the balance of the fees should be handed to the Bahrein Government.

Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Att es ted. for Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.(E 1885/30/91) 0 My dear Clauson In paragraph 3 of our official letter E 1885/30/91 of the 8th April about the new Bahrain laws respecting nationality and the ownership of real property by foreigners we asked that a certain interval, say at least two months, should be allowed to elapse between the publication of the law about property and the intended notification bringing it into force against Persian subjects, and added that a further communication might ^ follow regarding certain aspects of the question as affecting Persian subjects. The present letter is intended to be regarded as the further communication in question. 2. When the suggestion was first put forward in 1935 that the Bahrain Government might retaliate for the treatment of Bahrainis in Persia by placing before a substantial/ J Clauson, Esq - 7 MAY 1937substantial number of the Persian colony in Bahrain the unpleasant alternatives of (a) becoming Bahraini nationals or (b) remaining Persian nationals at the price of registering at the Political Agency and losing the right to own real property, we raised no objection because, leaving aside the expediency of retaliation, there appeared to be nothing in the legislation by which it was proposed that these objects should be attained that it was not perfectly permissible for any State to incorporate in its system of law if it wished to do so. We therefore contented ourselves in the main with purely legal and technical suggestions, only opposing the proposal that there should be discrimination as between British subjects and other foreigners in the matter of the fees to be paid to the Political Agency for registration and urging that safeguards with regard to the forced disposal of real property not less adequate than those contained in the Persian law of June 7th, 1931, regarding the ownership of agricultural property by foreigners should be incorporated in the property law. Our views on these aspects of the question were set out in Ward*s letter E 4931/762/91m * (3 of the 30th August, 1935, to you, and the enclosures to that letter, 3, It is, however, necessary, now that the legislation is on the point of coming into force, to take account of the probable reactions of the Persian Government. Y/e cannot expect them not to be annoyed, for they are clever enough and suspicious enough to guess that the measures are mainly directed against Persian nationals, even if the reasonable period for which we have asked is allowed, for the sake of appearances, to intervene between the promulgation of the legislation and the'hotification' of Persian nationals. But owing to the care which has been taken over the drafting of the laws, there is, fortunately, no provision to which they can point as constituting discrimination against Persia or any other country, or as amounting to a breach of any contractual obligation, or even as being, in the abstract, of an unreasonable or oppressive nature. Indeed precedents for many of the provisions are to be found in their own legislation. Provided therefore that no/I i~&gt;r no discrimination takes place in fact, we ought not to have any insuperable difficulty in finding an answer to any Persian complaints* 4. This question of discrimination in fact is, however, one with which we feel we ought to deal at this point, especially as we do not seem hitherto to have placed our views on the political aspect of the question on record in writing* The property law is permissive as regards notification, i.e. it leaves it to the discretion of the Bahrain Government whether to ’•notify** a foreign Government or not. Y/e expressed no objection to this at the time since it is always desirable to make provision for the exceptional case* But in general we could not, of course, agree to discrimination taking place against Persia in practice. In other words, if any other Government were brought to our notice or that of the Bahrain Government (especially by the Persian Government) as fulfilling conditions similar to those obtaining in Persia, we should probably be obliged to ask that the government in question should be **notified**. 5. Whether or not a foreign government fulfils the/the conditions of the Bahrain law is a question of fact, to be decided in each case on the facts. The Bahrain Government cannot be expected to be acquainted with the laws of all the countries in the world in regard to the ownership of property by foreigners. Moreover many States have different rules according to the personal characteristics of the foreigner concerned (e.g. whether he is a Moslem or not) and others have different laws in different parts of their territory (e.g. in the United States of America). In any case many States restricting the ov/nership of property by foreigners may have no nationals in Bahrain, and others again may have no Bahrainis in their territory. 6. For practical purposes the Bahrain Government would probably meet the required standard of non discrimination if they were to 'notify' the Government of any country which had been cited and confirmed as fulfilling conditions similar to those obtaining in Persia in the matter of the ownership of real property by foreigners and in which either (a) resident Bahrainis were in/- in practice restricted by the local municipal law in respect of the acquisition and ownership of real property or, alternatively v/hich had (b) nationals resident in Bahrain who, in the absence of 'notification”, would enjoy greater advantages than Persian nationals. Either condition might prove a sufficient basis for 'notification' from the point of view of meeting Persian complaints of discrimination. 7. In actual fact, as there are presumably no restrictions on the ownership of real property by Bahrainis in British India or the other Arab States of the Persian Gulf, the only countries which really come into the picture are Saudi Arabia and Iraq. 8. A copy of 'Regulations in respect of Landed Property in the Hejaz' issued by the Saudi Arabian Government in October 1934 was sent to the India Office under cover of Foreign Office letter E 6982/6849/25 of the 3rd December, 1934* On the 18th January, 1934 the Saudi Arabian Government issued an official communique which was intended to be an interpretation of certain points/points in the aforementioned regulations and a copy of ^ this communique was sent to the India Office under cover of Foreign Office letter E 1013/403/25 of the 13th t o# y/r February, 1935. In addition Foreign Office letter E 1461/403/25 of the 8th April, 1935 forwarded a copy of it&gt;' a despatch of the 12th February, 1935 from Ryan, : -K) ^ ’ V / ' summarising the position generally. 9. The effect of these regulations seems to be that no foreigner, not even a Moslem foreigner, may acquire or own real property in the Hejaz (except that a Moslem foreigner may acquire it for the purpose of converting it into a ’^qf 1 ) but that these restrictions do not apply in other parts of Saudi Arabia. 10. So far as we can ascertain without further reference to the Embassy in Bagdad, the acquisition and possession of immovable property by foreigners in Iraq is governed by (a) u The Immovable Property (Consent to Alienation) Proclamation,’* No. 58 of 1919; and (b) the for the Registration of Immovable Property in the of Juristic Persons,’* No. 34 of 1929. Copies of the/ ’*Law name77r; the foregoing enactments are enclosed for ready reference, together with a copy of a despatch No. CO/1344 of the 30th September, 1927 from the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Colonial Office, which treats of the question generally. 11. The position revealed by these documents is somewhat obscure, but seems to be that persons other than 'Arabs of the occupied territories' (presumably now 'Iraqi subjects') may not, v/hether juridical persons or individuals, acquire real property without the permission of the Ministry of Finance, which is not however as a rule withheld when the property is required for some legitimate purpose and is situated within the limits of a town or village. 12. We suggest that it might be prudent for the Bahrain authorities to make enquiries as to the position of the Bahrainis in the Hejaz (if any) or Iraq in regard to the ownership of real property. We will at the same time ask His Majesty’s Representatives at Jedda and Bagdad whether they (or the Consul at Basra) have any information on the subject.PROCLAMATION No.58. Whereas in consequence of the loss of records of the land registry offices, to the fact that many title deeds are known to he forged or false, with a view to check speculative land transactions and for other reasons it is expedient temporarily to restrict dealings in land. And whereas hy Notification, dated the 20th November, 1917, it was provided that the alienation of immovable property situated within the occupied territories of Mesopotamia to persons other than Arabs of the Occupied Territories would not be recognised unles. the previous consent in writing of the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief or some other person authorised by him in this behalf had been obtained in writing.

Sir, I Pave the honour to refer to the correspondence ending with your despatch No. 319 dated the 28th of March, 1927, on the subject of the acquisition of immovable property by foreigners. Draft law . 2. I now enclose a copy of a draft law which the Adviser to the Ministry of Justice expects his Minister will nut before the Council of Ministers shortly. This draft takes the place of the draft sent to you under cover of Sir Henry Dobb f s despatch No. &lt;;33 dated the 16th of February, 1927, but with the exception of the omission of any specific reference to foreign communities it follows much the same lines. 3. In the redrafting of this law consideration has been given to the suggestions contained in the third and fourth paragraphs of the Foreign Office letter of the 23rd March, 1927, and in this connection, I desire to make the following observations:- (a) It should not be overlooked tnat the present measure purports only to amend the law respecting the holding of immovable property by juristic persons and does not concern itself with the acquisition of land by foreigners generally which is governed by the Consent on Alienation Proclamation of 30th July, 1919. The principle established in that Proclamation was that the consent of the Revenue Secretary was necessary/ The Right Hon’ble L.C.M.S. Amery, P.C., M.P., Secretary of State for the Colonies, Downing Street, London, S.W.1.MO necessary to the acquisition of any land hy persons of non Arab race, and this discretionary power was later transferred to the Minister of Interior under the Transfer of Powers Proclamation. This Proclamation has never been interpreted as applying to the acquisition of land by foreign juristic persons and there appears to be considerable doubt as to how far the existing (Turkish) Law provides for such acquisition. The result has been that, in practice, foreign corporate bodies have been unable to acquire land, except in special cases such as the land granted to His Majesty’s Government for cemeteries in accordance with the treaty. Consequently the proposed law may be regarded to this extent as enlarging rather than restricting the rights of foreigners. (b) It would be I fear quite impossible to obtain from the ’’Iraq Government approval of the suggestion that their consent should only be required in cases where foreign corporations desired to acquire large tracts of land, as this would be a departure from the now well established principle that foreigners cannot become the registered owners of any immovable property, without permission of the Ministry of Interior. In practice I know of no case where permission has been withheld unreasonably and I see no reason to anticipate any change in the general policy of the Ministry of Interior should the draft under review become law. Briefly the policy followed lias been to place no impediment in the way of the purchase by foreigners of immovable property in towns, although applications involving the purchase of agricultural land have been enquired into more closely. (c) It should be noted that under clause 8 of the draft which lays down the principles on which the Minister of Interior may/may grant permission, provision is also made for the granting of permission by Royal Iradah. In this connection the force of tne caveat entered by the Foreign Office in the last portion of the third paragraph of their letter appears to have been recognised; as under this clause in no case will permission be directly dependent on Parliamentary approval. The higher authority of a Royal Iradah would no doubt be invoked in the type of cases which under present practice are more closely scrutinised. On the whole I am inclined to consider that this material clause, which seems sufficiently elastic, is unobjectionable, and, should it be accepted by Parliament without the addition of any more restrictive amendment, I do not think the legitimate business interests of any foreign companies are likely to be adversely affected. (d) With regard to the fourth paragraph of the Foreign Office letter, there would appear to be nothing in the law calculated to deprive foreigners who now enjoy the privileges of the Judicial Agreement, from claiming such privileges in the case of suits instituted in respect of immovable property held by foreign corporations. At the same time there is, I am aware a strong feeling amongst a section of 'Iraqi politicians, that in such circumstances foreigners should be debarred from these privileges, and this feeling might make the obtaining of a pledge in advance from the Iraq Government a difficult matter. It would, I feel, be preferable to await the passage of the measure through Parliament, when should any attempt be then made to insert an amendment embodying this view, steps could be taken promptly to remind the Iraq Government of their treaty obligations. 4. As I have indicated above, a change has been madeIt in the draft under the clauses dealing witn communities, nas always been a difficult matter to deal with the distinction between foreign and Iraqi Communities, which is necessarily based on the nationality of trie majority of their members. I am now advised tnat, under the law as redrafted, a foreign community, provided it could bring itself within the definition contained in clause 1(e), could also share the benefits of clause 7. In any case it would be open to a foreign community to register itself as an Association and thus come within the provisions of clause 5, and this would probably be the course of action best adapted to the requirements of European religious Communities. 5. Subject to a few possible drafting improvements of an immaterial character and the addition of a clause permitting registration by a Corporate mortgagee which are now being considered by the Adviser, I am prepared to acquiesce in this draft and I should be glad to know whether you concur. As the draft may be submitted to the Council of Ministers in the near future, it would be an advantage if you could communicate your views to me by telegraph. I have, etc. (Sd.) R.S.M.

OOPY 3 E’ r BY AIR y gl- /• S /UgMinute Paper P.Z.7420/36 Department P.Z.1826/35 I Under the Bahrein Order in Council 'foreigners with respect to whom the Sheikh of Bahrein has agreed with His Majesty for, or consented to, the exercise of jurisdiction by His Majesty' come under the jurisdiction of the Political Agent as well as British subjects and protected persons. In 1920 the late Sheikh was forced to acquiesce in the Political Agent’s jurisdiction over all foreigners whether Muslim or non-Muslim (including the subjects of the Persian Gulf States other than Bahrein). There exists, however, in Bahrein, a rather large resident population of Persian extraction whose litigious propensities have made them a nuisance in the Agency Courts. With a view to reducing this nuisance, the Bahrein Government, with the approval of the local Political Authorities, issued in February 1929 and re-issued in March 1953 a Proclamation ordaining that persons born in Bahrein of foreign parents would, unless registered at the Agency, be considered for all purposes as subjects of the Bahrein State. The Foreign Office suggested that it would be best for this Proclamation to be incorporated in an Enactment expressly purporting to be a Nationality Law. Such a law also appeared to be desirable in view of the growing importance of Bahrein. The proposal for a Nationality Law was approved on P.Z.7052/34, and the Government of India and the political Resident were consulted on the matter. The Political Resident agreed and suggested the lines on which the Law should be framed (the Government of India agreed). In the draft Law the t Resident proposed to incorporate a provision that foreigners in Bahrein whose Governments prohibited the ownership of real property by foreigners in the countriesof those Governments should he prohibited from owning real property in Bahrein except within the limits required for their residence, trade or craft. This provision was intended partly to act as a check on the registration of the 'Persian' population in Bahrein as foreigners (at any rate such of them as actually own property) and partly also as a retaliation against the Persian Government who introduced a law on these lines a few years ago which gave rise to considerable difficulty in connection with Bahreinis in Persia (see Mr. Laithwaite’s note of 11th April, 1935, No. P. Z. 2494/35) . The Foreign Office objected'*’ *Flag A (P. Z. 6129/35)] to the provision about the ownership of property being put into the Nationality Law, and a separate draft Property Law has been drawn up. The actual wording of the Nationality Law and the Property Law, which are flagged, has been agreed in d.o. consultation with the Foreign Office and with Colonel Fowle, the Government of India being kept informed. It is proposed to introduce both Laws at the same moment. As stated above the Property Law will, it is hoped, dissuade 'Persian Bahreinis' from registering as foreigners if they own property (unless it is for the purpose of their residence, trade or craft). But in order to avoid mass registration by those who do not own property outside these limits, it was suggested by the Political Resident that a special increased fee for registration at the Agency (instead of the ordinary registration fee of one rupee) should be introduced. The Foreign Office have agreed to this but they have pointed out that a special amendment of the Bahrein Order in Council is necessary for the purpose. A draft Order in Council has accordingly been drawn up by the Foreign Office. It is flagged below (P.Z.3341/36). Unfortunately, under Privy Council procedure, the draft Order in Council must include as an Appendix the Bahrein Nationality/ P.Z.1826/35~i 2.0 Minute Paper. Department. 4795 SHOO 5/:i6 Nationality Law, and it cannot do this until the Nationality Law has been approved and signed by the Sheikh. On the other hand, it is desirable (a) that the Order in Council and the Nationality Law should be issued at the same moment; and (b) that there should not be too long a gap between the submission of the draft Nationality Lav/ to the Bahrein Government and its issue, because of the danger that in the interval the approaching promulgation of the Law might be rumoured abroad and there might be a rush on the part of indigent 'Persian Bahreinis' to register before it took effect. After some discussion with the Foreign Office the programme detailed in their demi official letter () of the 14th October has been worked out. It is proposed to /» proceed on this programme. There are three other documents for approval arising out of the promulgation of the Laws. (1) a draft King’s Regulatiory v8iic\i is necessary, under the main Bahrein Order in Council, in order to apply the provisions of the property Law to non-Bahreinis; (2) a draft Notification (flagged) under Article 2 of the property Law, applying its provisions to Persian subjects. The provisions of Article 2, v/hich necessitate a notification before the Lav/ can apply to any particular country’s nationals, avoid any danger of difficulties arising over the ownership of property by Americans, of whom there are some in Bahrein, or Saudi Arabs, against whom the law is not directed. (3) a draft letter (flagged) to the Sheikh in regard to the fifth Article of the Nationality Law. The fifth Article enables the Sheikh to give or remove Bahrein nationality to or from any individual. The provision is, of course, desirable to cover any exceptional cases which might from time to time arise, but it is felt that it would be/be undesirable to give the Sheikh (even though the present Sheikh is now amenable) unfettered power to make and unmake Bahreini nationals. There is no reason to suppose that the Sheikh will not be quite ready to fall in with the request in the draft letter. The six documents mentioned above, namely, the two Laws, the draft Order in Council, the draft King’s Regulation, the draft Notification and the draft letter, are now submitted for sanction. A draft letter to the Foreign Office is also submitted requesting their official concurrence, and a draft letter of instructions to the Resident^/# FO c^v*****^ ')ri_/2-0 V 3 - Draft Paper. political Department.

In the first place it is a rule that any copy of an Order in Council that is to be '’exhibited” shall be a certified true copy and it is hardly correct to certify as a true copy a text that has not actually been compared with the signed original. In the second it is important that the text of the Nationality Law shall be available in its final form as signed by the Sheikh before the Order in Council is made, since Article 2 of the law forms a schedule to the Order in Council. For these and other technical reasons we are exceedingly reluctant ; ENOLOSURt IN Alii MAIL LETTER M. J. ClauaAig Esq., 21 N0VJ936 .AIRMAIL, to/ FROM 8 08 . V, POLITICAL AND „ ' . ' OEPT.

In these circumstances we would suggest the following alternative programme. The text of the Bahrain nationality law should be finally approved in London and sent to Bahrain for signature, or rather for the signature of a correct translation into Arabic of this text. The Sheikh would then sign the law but refrain for the moment from promulgating it. The Political Agent would report the date of the signature of the law to the India Office by telegraph, informing them at the same time of any alteration in the wording - no matter how small - that might have been introduced into the law and require any change in the English translation in Bahrain. The Order in Council would then be able to go before the Privy Council as at present drafted with only one alteration, viz; the substitution of the word ,f on u for the words H one calendar month from” in the last sentence of Article 4(1). As soon as the Order in Council had been passed the necessary/7“ 4T — necessary certified copies would be sent to Bahrain and the Sheikh f s law could then be promulgated simultaneously with the exhibition of the Order in Council in the office of the Political Agent.

Colonel Fowle. Bahrein Nationality Law and Property Law. We have now got all the drafts ready and approved (uemi-otlicially) at this end. (They are all flagged in the file below). Provided you concur in the draft King* Regulation, it only remains to submit all the drafts formally for sanction here and to get the formal concurrence of the Foreign Office, Snags, however, occur in regard to the machinery after that.

One possibility might be to discover when a Privy Council is likely to take place, get the Bahrein Government to make the laws just before, then g et the Order in Council, and immediately afterwards arrange the simultaneous promulgation of the Bahrein Laws and exhibition of the Order in Council by telegraph.

The question of the disposal of the fees is clearly not one of vital importance. If you and Beckett consider that Fowled points are of substance, you will no doubt make the necessary alterations in Article 3 of the draft Order in Council; but we are quite ready to leave things as they are and to allow the Sheikh to get the proceeds of registration^provided that the cost of collection is adequately covered. . ^ I S&lt;u*j h ^ J&lt;ufak. The point about the fee to be collected under Article 5 of the Bahrein Nationality Law, raised in Hickinbotham’s letter of 30th May, seems to be primarily for the Bahrein Government to decide.

Colonel Fowle in his letter below has raised a fresh point, i.e. whether it is not necessary to issue a draft King's Regulation providing sanction for the application of the Property Law. Colonel Fowle is right in thinking'this is necessary, as the present position in Bahrein as regards foreigners is that the jurisdiction over all foreign subjects rests with the political authorities (see Laithwaite's memorandum of 1930).

A point arises, which, so far as I know, has not yet been considered, i.e. ho?f sanction for the application of the Property Law is to be legally obtained. Since the individuals affected are foreigners this sanction must derive from us, presumably in the form of a King*s Regulation under Article 70 (b) of the Bahrain Order in Council applying the local Property Law. If this presumption is correct I suggest that a draft King^ Regulation may be prepared by the Foreign Office. 5. I note from the enclosure to India Office Printed Letter No. P.Z.2827/S6 dated the 28th April 1956, that it has been agreed that the fee for registration for the purposes of Articles 1 and 2 of the Nationality Law should be fixed at Rupees 25 and that the Foreign Office are preparing a draft Amending Order in Council. 6. With reference to paragraph 5 of the India Office letter referred to in my paragraph 1 above. I enclose a copy of a draft letter which it is proposed to address the Shaikh after personal negotiations. Loch considers, and I agree, that it would be preferable to leave him to write a simple letter of acceptance couched in his own words. 7. Owing tothe necessity of keeping the proposal secret until the laws are actually brought into force in order to prevent prior mass registration, and the impossibility of preventing leakage should the proposal be communicated to the Shaikh (and through him to his family) at the present stage.the draft laws have not been put before His Excellency# The Adviser, Bahrain Government, has, however, been consulted fully by the Political Agent on his draft laws and my foregoing recommendations relating thereto. I suggest that advantage should be taken of the Shaikhs presence in England during his forthcoming visit to put the matter before His Excellency. As his Adviser will be with him. His Excellency should have no difficulty in replying and I think we can assume that he will raise no difficulties. The text of the two laws and the Bahrain Government Notification would then be sent by the Shaikh to his representative in Bahrain for immediate promulgation. At the same time His Majesty f s Government would telegraph me repeating Political Agent, Bahrain, that this was being done, and the Political Agent would arrange for the simultaneous publication of the King’s Regulation and Amending Order in Council referred to in my paragraphs 4 and 5 above. 8. It may be convenient to sum up the steps still to be taken before the two laws can be brought into force. A. As I have no comments to offer on the two drafts (except that I prefer the alternative text suggested for Clause 2 (c) of the Nationality Law) His Majesty’s Government will presumably now finally approve of the two drafts. B. His Majesty’s Government to approve or otherwise of (1) the Bahrain Government draft Notification referred to in my paragraph 3 above, and (2) the draft letter to the Shaikh referred to in my paragraph 6 above.

The proposed Bahrein Nationality Law provides that persons born in Bahrein of foreign parents may retain their foreign nationality by registering at the Political Agency under the conditions set out in sub-clauses (a) and (b) of Article 2 (draft of the Nationality Law as it now stands is flagged). In order to avoid mass registration of Persians it has been thought desirable to charge a high fee of Rs.25 for such registration. As this might cause hardship to non-Persian foreigners it is proposed to regard registration of birth as a proof of nationality for the purposes of this law and a sub-clause (c) has accordingly been added to Article 2. 3• In order to empower the Political Agent to register foreigners and to charge the fee it is necessary to issue an amending Order in Council. The Foreign Office have now sent over a draft which will be found immediately below. It seems to be generally suitable and I think the Foreign Office are right in thinking that the proceeds of the fees should go to the Sheikh. Subject to their observations it is therefore proposed to write to Colonel Fowle as in the draft attached. 4. One small point has occurred to me. It is not, of course, intended to charge a fee of Rs.25 for the registration of birth envisaged in sub-clause (c) of Article 2; nor is it necessary to empower the Political Agent to 4424 5000 1/ register such sharlgee because he is already entitled to do so;in the case of British subjects ; under the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Acts / and in the case of British protected persons and foreigners / under the Indian Births, Deaths and Marriages Registration Act of 1886 as applied /Draft Paper, P. 2.3341/36. political Department.

Mr. Glausoj 17 Bahrein Nationality Law . You will remember that Colonel Loch and Colonel Fowle, in their letters at P.Z.9043, suggested that the registration fee envisaged under this law should be a high one, sc as to prevent a mass of Persians rushing to register themselves as foreigners. In order to prevent hardship to British subjects and protected persons and other foreigners through the imposition of this heavy lee, they suggested that the registration of the birth of their children by such persons should be deemed, for the purposes of the law, as a proof of their foreign nationality. In your letter to the Foreign Office at P.Z.9043/35, you accordingly suggested a draft of an 3 additional Article/giving effect to this proposal. This has called forth vari ous comments from the * Foreign Office: (see their letter belovA They point out (1) that the registration provided for under the Bahrein Order in Council and referred to by colonel fclh, is not in fact a registration of birth but a/Tregistration of residence; (^) that the Political Agent, Bahrein, is entitled, under the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act, to register the birth of British subjects (but not British protected persons); and (3) that the Political Resident at Bahrein under King»s Regulation l; ISte might, by*liberal interpretation of this Regulation, be U{ f 1 ^ authorised to register the births of British protected persons and foreigners. They suggest further, that the inclusion of the new proposed Article 3 is unnecessary, and that it would be sufficient to add a further sub-clause to Article 2. They suggest two alternative texts for this additional sub-clause, depending upon whetherthe registration provided for under (1) above is to be counted or not. It would appear to be simpler to leave ^ o ikdL it out of account and to concentrate upon either two forms of registration, but, for reasons stated below, it may be desirable to include it. It may now be useful to examine the effect of Article E as it stands at present with the modification suggested by the Foreign Office. To take in the first place the case of Persians born in Bahrein - (i) Persians over 18 years of age wishing to retain their foreign nationality will have to register under (b) and pay the high registration fee. (ii) Persians between 2 and 18 years of age wishing to retain their foreign nationality will have to register under (a) and pay the high registration fee. *(iii) Persians under £ years of age can be registered under (c) and would not then have to pay the high fee. This latter category will, presumably, be very small in numbers, and the mass registration feared by the Local Authorities will therefore be avoided. Once the law has come into force the Persian inhabitants can be divided into three categories - A. Persians born in Bahrein who have registered either under (a), (b) or (c), and have therefore retained their foreign nationality. B. Persians who have failed to register and have therefore automatically become Bahreini nationals.^ C. Persians arriving in Bahrein after the date of the lav/. The children of A. and C. will be able to retain their foreign nationality by having their birth registered within two years of its occurrence (Article 2(c)), but the children3o3 Minute Paper. Department. of B wiii caw^inuo be Bahreinis and will not be able to register under any of the headings of Article 2 of the law because their parents have ceased to possess the nationality of another state. The effect of these provisions seems, therefore, to be satisfactory from our point of view so far as Persians are concerned. To turn now to the case of British subjects and British protected persons and other foreigners born in Bahrein. The considerations set out above apply generally to them. In the case of Persians, it is our object to bring them, if possible, under the jurisdiction of the Bahrein Government; but the reverse it' applies in the case of persons at present being considered. It is possible, therefore, that the law as it stands bears undu^ly harshly on them. It is to be hoped, hov/ever, that these persons have already in fact registered the births of their children with the Political Agent, in which case they^^iil bo ablu tro i-jQiMtrr tl' thfflir — r ^ Irhirg-aruid pujimunt ni' Un I’llgli rogioti^ti»ft foe. Colonel Loch states that various foreigners, Iraqis, Americans, etc., have, in fact, done so. If, however, British subjects have been remiss in registering the births of their children, and have therefore laid themselves open to payment of the high registration fee, it might be desirable, if they were in sufficient numbers, to include the registration of residence provided for under the Bahrein Order in Council as tantamount^ as a to proof of nationality aa&amp;the register of birth. 3939 5000 7/35 1/I suppose we had better consult Colonel Fowle on this point, we might at the same time ash whether he and also the draft Property Law which is to be proclaimed simultaneously. Once these drafts have been finally decided upon we shall then have to issue an amending Order in Council along the lines suggested in our letter at P.Z.6588/35. Article 5 of the Nationality Law is to be subject to an exchange of letters between the political Agent and the Sheikh of Bahrein, in which the Sheikh will agree not to exercise his powers under this Article without the previous consent of the political Agent. We might ask colonel powle to have drafts prepared and submit them for our approval. Jj &amp; r &lt;fa/h ^ „ JM r [ L»*. yiJtwJTU* ^ agrees to the Nationality Law as a whole as it now stands,Bos' I set forth Beckett’s comments fully, 2* He draws attention to the fact that there are first of all the provisions of the Bahrain Order in Council Articles 51 to 59 as amended by the Order in Council of 1922. Under these provisions it is compulsory for all British subjects and British Protected Persons resident in Bahrain to register yearly and under Article 2(4) of the Amending Order the head of a family should register his children.Even though this means that a child of a person resident in Bahrain ought to be registered under 2(4) within a year of his birth, this registration is quite definitely not a registration of the birth but a registration of residence and therefore would not satisfy the text which you propose in your letter. Paragraph 4 of Powle’s letter No. 943-S of the 6th December somewhat misses the point as the sort of registration to which he refers must be left out of account unless the text is amended. We think that in any case instead of a new Article 3 we might deal with the new proposal by an addition to Article 2, which might be made to read 'Persons born in Bahrain before or after the date of this 'law, whose fathers at the time of these persons’ birth 'possessed/■ ’’possessed the nationality of another state shall not he ’’considered to he Bahrain nationals, ”(a) if they register at the Political Agency v/ithin ’’one year of the date on vtfiich they attain the ”age of 18 if then resident in Bahrain, or v/ithin ’’one year of the date of the commencement of ’’their residence in Bahrain, if not then resident ”in Bahrain; or ”(h) if they register at the Political Agency ’’within one year of the date of promulgation of ’’this law if they have already attained the age ”of 18 and are resident in Bahrain; or ”(c) if their hirths shall have been registered at 'the Political Agency within tv/o years of their ’’occurrence. ” If registration under the Bahrain Order in Council is to he counted, then (c) must he amended to read ”if they ’’shall have been registered at the Political Agency within ’’two years of their hirths or if their hirths shall have ’’been registered v/ithin two years of their occurrence”* This may look tautologons hut it is not! 3./ .Under the British Nationality and Status of Act, Section 19 (l) (c), the Secretary of State is given power to make regulations for the registration by officers in the diplomatic and consular services of His Majesty of the births and deaths of British subjects born or dying out of His Majesty^ dominions, and under Section 27 ’’British Consulate” includes in the case of a territory where there is no British consulate and there is a British resident or other representative of His Majesty, the office of such resident or representative. Consequently in Bahrain it includes the Political Agent. The Secretary of State’s regulations have been made in 1930 and amended in 1932 (Statutory Rules and Orders 1930 No. 740, and 1932 No. 586). These regulations apply in Bahrain but it is important to notice that they apply only to British subjects, not to British Protected Persons. It is important that the Political Agents at Bahrain and elsewhere should be aware of these regulations because in some cases the title of an individual to be a British subject depends upon whether his birth has been so registered within one or two years of its occurrence. In Bahrain the Political Agent should keep his register of the births of British subjects separate from the register/ Aliensregister of the births of other persons. Where an application is made to register the birth of a British subject, the Political Agent should we think deal with it under the Regulations referred to in this paragraph and not under Kin^s Regulation No.l. The registration of other births could be dealt with under Kin^s which simply applies to Bahrain the Indian Births, Deaths and Marriages Registration Act, 1886, and makes the Political Agent the Registrar for the purposes of that Act in Bahrain. The King f s Regulation is not very were the classes of persons whose births the Political Agent was authorised to register under the Indian Act as applied to Bahrain. We may assume that the Political Agent cannot have been intended to register the births and deaths of persons who were not subject to his jurisdiction at all. But in Bahrain he has jurisdiction over all persons except Bahrain subjects, i.e. foreigners, British Protected Persons and British subjects. Did the King’s Then there is King’s Regulation No.l of 1922 satisfactory in that it failed to make it clear what Regulation/Regulation mean that he was to register for all these three classes or for one or more of them only? The King* s Regulation gives no help on this point at all and one looks therefore at the Indian Act to see if anything can be derived from it. Section 2 of the Indian Act says 'This Act extends to the whole of British India and 'applies also v/ithin the dominions of Princes and States 'in India in alliance with Her Majesty to British subjects 'in those dominions'. The act therefore appears to authorise the register of the births of anybody of any nationality taking place in British India, and in the case of Indian Native States, only to the births of British subjects. Beckett thinks that the proper construction of the Act as applied to Bahrain by the King*s Regulation is that it applies to all persons in Bahrain who are under British jurisdiction i.e. all British subjects, British Protected Persons and foreigners, though for the reasons explained in paragraph 3 we think in practice it should be applied only to British Protected persons and foreigners. It seems therefore that neither Fov/le in paragraph 4 of his letter of the 6th December, nor Loch in/Z\o in paragraph 5 of his letter of the 24th November have really got the point right. If we have rightly construed the King’s Regulation then it is true that foreigners are able to register their births and marriages at the Political Agency; if we have not construed it rightly then there appears to be no authority under which the Political Agent has been registering their births and deaths. The Indian Act seems to make the registration of births under it voluntary only i.e. a father may register the birth of his child but he is not compelled to do so. 6. With regard to the draft law regarding ownership of property we are in general agreement but suggest for the sake of clarity the insertion of the words 'of the 'notice' in the 4th line of paragraph 3 between 'publication' and 'owns'.Z. 1533 '1936 Confidential D.O. Mo. 116-3 of 1936. / The Residency, Se n Bushire, ohe 15th February 1936 ^ Ii^y dear Glaus on, Gould you please refer to the last two sentences of paragraph 1 of your demi-official letter Ro # P.d. 7185/35, dated the 14th October 1935, on the juridical position of subjects of the Arab States of the Persian Gulf vis-a-vis the Rulers of other similar States. 2. The position can be summarised as follows:- A. Bahrain. (1) Subjects of other Arab States in the Gulf are juridically treated as British protected persons, i.e. they come under the Political Agent not the Shaikh. It would appear that when the Political Agent issued the notice referred to in paragraph 2 of India Office letter Bo. P.Z. 7185 covering all foreign subjects, it snould presumably only have covered lataris and Rejdis (Saudi subjects). But, as in practice, jurisdiction over foreign subjects and British protected persons has been exercised for many years by the Political Agent without any objection from the present Shaikh, there would hardly seem any necessity now to raise the question of our right to this jurisdiction. (2) Subjects of Kuwait, Muscat, atar, and Trucial Sheikhdoms are not registered as British protected persons, because for the purposes of registration, as opposed to jurisdiction, they have not been regarded as “British subjects n , although the term includes British protected persons (see Article M.J. Glauson Esquire, 2/ The India Office, London.2 (1) of M The Bahrain (Amendment) Order in Council, 1922 n and in the definition in Article 4 of 'The Bahrain Order in Council, 1913'). As far as I am aware, no person in these categories has ever asked to be registered as a British protected person, though they come under the Political Agent if involved in civil or criminal proceedings. B * Kuvvait . Individuals in question are not treated as British protected persons i.e. they come unaer the Shaikh not the Political Agent - vide Bickson's telegram ho. 295 of 7th October 1935 to me, repeated to Secretary of state for India under his ho.* 296. c * Muscat .

Will you kindly refer to the correspondence ending with the express letter dated 6th December, No.943 S. from the Political Resident, Bushire (of which a copy was sent to the Foreign Office on 18th December, P.Z.9043/35), on the subject of the Bahrein Nationality Law. I promised Malcolm that we would write to the Foreign Office about this, and I am sorry to have been so long in Fowle’s and Loch’s proposals seem to offer a reasonable basis for consideration, subject to any comments fre. which Beekott may have to make. If the ouggootion is accepted it would seem that all that would be necessary or after the date of this law, whose fathers at the time of those persons’ birth possessed the nationality of another state and whose birth was registered at the Political Agency (?) in Bahrein within one of the doing so. COF o .MR MAH- ( ? HloJ would be to add an extra Article fats* Art. 3) to the draft Nationality Law, roughly on the following lines:- 'Persons born in Bahrein before date of birth, shall not be considered to be Bahrein nationals 3761 5:)00 5.35and shall not be required to register in accordance with the provisions of Art. 2.' The amending Order in Council suggested by Beckett and mentioned in my letter to Fowle of the 11th October, P.Z.6588/35, would still be appropriate. The question of the draft law regarding ownership of immoveable property in Bahrein by foreigners, which of course is bound up with the Nationality Law has not, I fear, progressed sigice our meeting Hi 'VavJJc with Fowle in October. Subsequently that meeting it was, I think, agreed that it was desirable to expand the draft Law to make fair provision for the sale of property by foreigners in whose possession it was at the time when the law came into effect.

Z m Foreigners born in 3] rain fall into two classes those vho owfi landed property and (b), the ^reat majority, those who co not orn landed property. In th&lt; event of their ov:n «overnBent not alloving Bahrain subjects to hold property, foreigners vouid have under tlie pro osed Nationality I*aw (or subsidary lar) (i) to become Bt,hx % ala subjects, or Ail) 1 S &lt;J.

A hose who h&amp;ve landed property will in *11 probability seek to become B^hr&amp;in subjects) v.hose who do net hold handed property soty flock to the Agency to register es foreigners. This is undesirable and can only be prevented by imposing an high fee for registration* &gt;n high fee might beer hardly on poor British subjects and protected persons and it is desirable to avoid hardship to them without discrimination against other foreigners# 4. 1 venture to suggest the following device for prevent ing hardship to Tsritish subjects and protected persons (and also to other foreigners in Bahrain) ^tiile making it possible to impose a heavy fee for registration as a foreign subject uncer the provisions of the proposed Bahrain Nationality Ill British subjects may (voluntarily) register the births of their children under Mag*9 Regulation ho^l of 13^2 LThe Births, Deaths and Marriages Regulation 1&amp;P2) under the Bahrain Order-in-Council. It is not clear, however, whether the term British subject includes British protected persons. ’’The Births, Deaths and Merricges Registration /ct, 1.88f r speak* only of British subjects, but in the definition of 'British subject' in the Bahrain Order-in-Council, it includes British protected person. Personally I should Interpret the position ai being that for the supposes of Bahrain British protected persons are included. 5. In any case, foreigners (i.e., persons other then Bahrain subjects) may register the births of their children in s Register kept in the agency and a few (American, ‘Iraqis and so on) h?ve done so. No Perslens have done so as they hold /Bahrain3 Bahrain to be a part of Persia, so do not register &amp;s foreigners, though they gladly accept the position of foreigner for the purpose of recourse to the Agency Courts. 6* I suggest that s 1 those *hose births have been thus registered (see oer«gr*pfa» 4 and 5 above) in the Agency should be def»ed for the purposes of the proposed Bahrain Nationality Lav to have ret-ined their foreign nationality. It is possible that a clause to that effect in the Bahrain Nationality La» night be considered necessary. 7.Any person born in Bahrein other than those %ho are deessed to have retained their foreign nationality as in para graph 6 above could be required under the Bahrain B&amp;tlonaJLity Law to pey a fee of Its. 25/- for the registra tion of their foreign nationality in the Agency. This fee should prevent a rush for registration by foreigners without landed property. £. It ^ould be essential to keep the procedure suggested in paragraphs 6 and 7 above confidential as otherwise there would be likely to be e rush of applicants to register in the Agency between the tiasa that the proposals becoiae known and the tine that the Bahrain Nationality Law comes into force.

LETTER. /K 11 OCT 1335 (u t* With reference to the discussion at the Foreign Office yesterday which you attended about the proposed Nationality Law for Bahrein, I enclose herewith copy of the draft Bahrein Nationality Law in the form in which it emerged from our discussion, together with a copy for your records of Ward’s letter to me of 30th August last (No.E. 4931/7 62/91^. With reference to Article 5 of the draft Law, you pointed out that there might be serious objections to allowing the Sheikh of Bahrein the unfettered right to make and unmake Bahrein nationals, for example in the case of British subjects, and it was agreed th^t Article 5 should be subject to an exchange of letters between the Political Agent and the Sheikh of Bahrein, in which the Sheikh would agree not to exercise his powers under this Article without the previous consent of the Political Agent. 2 . You will remember that Beckett madeOrder in Council a differential registration fee for foreigners as opposed to British subjects, and Beckett suggested that registration for the purposes of the Bahrein Nationality Law which would be non-recurrent should be kept entirely separate from the present annual routine registration of British subjects under the Order in Council, and that the former registration should be applied to British subjects born in Bahrein as well as to persons of other nationalities on exactly the same terms. Beckett suggested that an amending Order in Council should be passed which might be somewhat on the following terms:- 'The Political Agent shall keep a register of persons entitled to register with him for the purposes of Articles 1 and 2 of the Bahrein Nationality Law. Each registration shall be subject to a fee of x rupees. You emphasized the importance of charging a fairly high fee for registration for this purpose in order to deter persons born in Bahrein of Persian extraction from registering en masse at the Political Agency, thus divesting themselves of Bahrein nationality. It was agreed that you should ascertain from Loch the approximate number of British subjects and protected persons born in Bahrein who/date of the enactment of the Bahrein Nationality Law. It should then be possible to observe the effects of the Nationality Law and to calculate the number of additional persons who would have to be registered by the Political Agent if Beckett’s proposal were adopted. 5. With regard to the proposal to undertake a complete revision of the Bahrein Order in Council the Foreign Office, in deference to the views expressed by Loch and by the Government of India, agreed not to press this proposal for the present, but they expressed the opinion that it was desirable that the task should be taken in hand within the next year or two. 6.

We agree that it would be desirable to discuss this question at a meeting wliich would be attended by Fowle , and I enclose herewith for consideration at the meeting copies of a draft Nationality Law and of a Law regarding the Ownership of Land and Property in Bahrein by Foreigners. 2. With reference to paragraph 4 of Ward's letter, Fowle, with whom we have discussed this point, says that the danger of mass registration of 'Persians is a real one and that- some preventive must be devised against it. We are unable at present to suggest any solution other than that of raising the registration fee against foreigners, as proposed by Fowls , but we understand that the Foreign Office might not, in the last resort, object to this if no other solution can be devised. 3. There might perhaps be time at the meeting to discuss also the question of revising the Bahrein Order in Council and the question of jurisdiction over foreigners in Qatar, about which Malcolm wrote^ronSOth September (your reference E 5243/3400/91). With regard to the revisi on/ t ut z. I revision of the Bahrein Order in Council, we understand from Malcolm that Beckett will not see any particular difficulty in allowing this question to stand over for the present if the Resident and the Political Agent see objection to proceeding with it immediately. 4. We would suggest that we might have a meeting either here or at the Foreign Office, whichever suits you best, at 11.30 next Tuesday, 8th October, if that time is convenient for Beckett and for the Eastern Department.

So far so good. With regard to clause 5, they also see no objection in principle (vide enclosure already C 5 referred to) but think that they should be dealt with not in the nationality law itself, but in a separate one to be published.

(E 4931/762/91) Dear Clauson, You will remember that I discussed with you the other day the question of the proposed Bahrain nationality law. I explained that although the matter had been fully gone into on receipt of the copy of Powle*s express letter No.244-S of 2nd March forwarded with your official letter P.Z.1826/35 of 19th March, we had unfortunately omitted by an oversight to give you our observations at the time. 2. To remedy this lapse I now enclose: (1) a copy of a minute by Beckett of 27th March in which he comments in detail on the Resident’s proposals.; (2) a copy of a memorandum of Baggallay on the Persian aspect of the proposed law. 3. We have now received your further official letter P.Z.2494/35 of 13th August, and notice from the enclosure/ M.J. Clauson, Esq,enclosure therein that the Government of India are in agreement with Powle f s proposals. Their express letter does not, however, introduce any new consideration, and with one exception I do not think it is necessary for us to add anything at this stage to the expression of our views as set out in the enclosures to this letter. 4. The one additional point on which we feel we should comment is the suggestion in paragraph 8 of Fowle's express letter of 2nd March that in order to prevent a mass registration of Persian subjects at the Agency the customary registration fee for foreigners might be raised as compared with the 1 Rupee per annum required from British I^disns. We notice that the Government of India approve this proposal, but we do not ourselves like it at all, as it introduces an element of discrimination (albeit ostensibly against non-British foreigners as a whole). This seems to us indefensible upon any ground, but we should be particularly loath to subscribe to the reason which Powle cites in the third sentence of paragraph 8 of his express letter. It is clearly in our interest to possess jurisdiction/— 350 jurisdiction over all foreigners in Bahrain, with the consequent obligation of undertaking the registration of foreigners through our representative at Bahrain, and we could hardly justify an increase in the fee charged to foreigners on the ground that the Agency existed solely for the benefit of British and British Indian subjects. 5. Y/e should be grateful for an opportunity to see the draft of any reply which you may propose to send to the Acting Resident. 6. If you agree, it might save time and a good deal of correspondence if we were to have a meeting in due course, which Beckett would be prepared to attend, to discuss the terms of the proposed legislation. It might be better, though, for a draft of the nationality law, and of any separate law to deal with the possession of real property by foreigners, to be available for consideration at the meeting; and if you agree with the suggestions in Beckett’s minute of 27th March you may like to consider asking Colonel Loch or one of your legal advisers to take steps to have the necessary draft or drafts prepared.551 COPY (E 1840/762/91) I will deal separately with points Nos,1-4 of paragraphs 3 of the ftlitical Agent 1 s despatch on the one hand and point 5 on the other. Points 1-4 are the lines upon which a future Bahrain nationality law should he framed. Eventually a draft of the proposed law in a form suitable for enactment will have to he prepared and this I understand is to he done jointly hy the Foreign Offic and the India Office. I do not see any objection to points 1-4 as far as they go hut they require a good deal of expansion and there are a number of points which require thinking out before we can get to the stage of actually drafting a law. I do not think we have got to the stage when the text of a draft law could he produced yet, hut I shall set out below certain suggestions in this con nexion which might, I think, he put to the India Office for consideration. I am not attempting to put them out in the language or the form of a law yet, hut I think what I have put down will assist towards further consideration of the points which the draft law must eventually cover. My suggestions are as follows:- (1) All persons horn in Bahrain before or after the date of this law are Bahrain nationals except persons, whose fathers at the time of those persons 1 births possessed the nationality of another state and who are registered at the Political Agency. (a) within one year of the date of their majority, if then resident in Bahrain or within one year of the date of the commencement of their residence/residence in Bahrain, if not then resident in Bahrain; or (h) within one year of the date of this law if they are already of age and resident in Bahrain. The periods of one year specified in (a) and (b) above may be extended at the discretion of the Political Agent. (2) All persons born abroad before or after the date of this law of fathers possessing Bahrain nationality at the time of those persons* birth and whose father or grandfather was born in Bahrain are Bahrain nationals except persons whose fathers were resident abroad during the minority of such persons and who, if resident in Bahrain might have been registered at the Political Agency under (a) or (b) of Article 1. (3) A person who possesses Bahrain nationality shall lose it. (a) if he voluntarily acquires by naturalisation the nationality of another State and an order cancelling his Bahrain nationality is given by the Ruler of Bahrain, either on the application of that person °r p roprio motu s (b) if he also possesses the nationality of another State and an order cancelling his Bahrain nationality is given by the Ruler of Bahrain on the application of that person. (4) (i) A woman who marries a Bahrain national shall acquire Bahrain nationality and a woman of Bahrain natL onality who marries a foreigner shall\ lose Bahrain nationality if and when she acquires the nationality of her husband hut not otherwise. (ii) A woman who has acquired Bahrain nationality by marriage shall lose it when divorced or a widow if she acquires or possesses another nationality. Bahrain nationality may be restored to her by an order of the Ruler of Bahrain given on her application. (5) The Ruler of Bahrain may grant Bahrain nationality to any person resident in Bahrain who applies for it and may subsequently cancel the grant if such person ceases to reside in Bahrain. As regards 5, I see no objection to the proposal in principle, but I do not think that this matter should be treated in the nationality lav/ itself, though it may well be treated in another law which will be published and come into force at the same time. This proposal will also re quire a good deal of development and thinking out before it can reach a legislation form. In this connexion the follow ing points have occurred to me. The text speaks of M owning land and property”. I suppose, however, that in the first place only real property is intended. Secondly, there are in western systems of law at any rate at least two different forms of ownership of real property (in the loose sense) i.e. the possession of the freehold and the possession of land upon a lease, and it may be necessary to make it clear whether or not both these two things are being covered. There are restrictions on the ownership of real property by foreigners not only in Persia but in anumber of other countries, viz. Saudi Arabia. Further, even in some parts of the British Empire, for example some of the Australian States, foreigners are unable to own the freehold of land, though I think th , -U \-'s they can hold land under lease. The position is the same in a number, though not in all, of the States of the United States of America. Restrictions in fact on the ownership of land by foreigners are faily common. Supposing, therefore, that this proposal is adopted, it may be a question of some judgment whether a given class of foreigners falls under it or not and it may be desirable that the text of the law should provide that the classes of foreigners who come under this provision should be those notified by the Political Agent in some form or other. Further it will be necessary to have reasonable provisions enabling foreigners who at present own land in Bahrain and will cease to be able to do so under this future law to dispose of their interests under reasonable conditions. One observation occurs to me in connexion with the personal letter of the 17th November from the Political Resident to the Indian Foreign Secretary. It may be true, as he says, that it is desirable that Persians in Bahrain should be brought under Bahrain jurisdiction, but I think it is clear that it is only desirable that they should be brought under it as Bahrain nationals and not otherwise. We do not want Persians in Bahrain as foreigners not possess ing Bahrain nationality ( to come directly under the native jurisdiction. Such a state of affairs would in my opinion be likely to lead to trouble, because we carry internal! onal responsibility for the manner in which foreigners are treated in Bahrain. (Sgd)W. E. Beckett 27th March 1935COPY. 3 s 5 (E 2159/762/91) Proposed restrictions on the ownership of real property by foreigners in Bahrain , Discussions are at present going on regarding the proposed enactment of a new Bahrain nationality law, by which any person born in Bahrain of foreign parents will be regarded as a Bahraini subject unless he is registered as a foreigner at the British agency, and the simultaneous enactment of legislation providing that foreigners v/hose own governments forbid foreigners to own real property shall be forbidden to own land or property in Bahrain except within India Office letter P.Z.1826/35 of February 13 (E 1840/762/91) enclosing a copy of a telegram from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf), property except for their own residences or business purposes, the efiect of this prohibition will, it appears, be most keenly felt by the Persian colony in Bahrain, against whom it is in fact directed, and many of them will have to get rid of their property unless they accept Bahraini nationality, 3. Although there is no objection to placing this choice of disagreeable alternatives before the Persians in Bahrain, it is on general principles desirable that those who have to get rid of their property should be allowed to do so under conditions the limits required for their business, trade or craft (see 2. As foreigners in Persia are unable to own real not/3S&gt;k&gt; &amp;&gt; Hot more onerous than those imposed on foreigners in similar circumstances in Persia in the past. -i. The position in Persia appears to he that foreigners&gt; or at any rate non-Moslems, were originally unable to hold real property at all, Article 5 of the Russo-Persian Commercial Treaty of 1828 however gave Russian subjects the right to own property in Persia for their residences and warehouses. Through the operation of most-favoured nation clauses Article 5 became the charter for all foreigners in Persia to own property for their own residential and business purposes, (but for no other). 5. The general prohibition seems to have been disregarded, however, and on January 29th, 1931, the £-ei si an Government felt it necessary to pass a law requiring all foreigners to dispose of their agricultural property ■see E 3341/2040/34 (1931). This law only gave the foreigner three months in which to do so, but contained certain safeguards (in theory at any rate) to ensure that he received a proper price. 6. The position of Persians in Bahrain is different from that of Bahrainis in Persia, in that the former will have some choice as to their nationality and the latter have had none (but have at the same time had no difficulty about keeping their property if they accepted tue outwardand visible signs of ersian nationality). But it would be fair that such Persians as elect to retain their ov/n national! ity under the new Bahraini nationality law should be allovred to dispose of their real property on terms/terms more or less similar to those of the Persian lav/ of January 29th 1931. 7. There is one apparent precedent which might he regarded as a reason for granting less favourable terms than those of the law of January 29th, 1931, to the Persians in Bahrain, i.e. the treatment of certain British subjects who have been required of late to dispose of their real property in Persia. But the precedent is not a true one and it is therefore desirable to explain the circumstances of these cases, if only to dispose of them: f. On September 7th 1929, the Persian Government introduced a new nationality law which, with supplemen tary articles passed on October 21st 1930, provided that certain persons who were Persian subjects under the new law, but had hitherto been foreign subjects, could opt for their foreign nationality v/ithin one year from the passing of the supplementary articles. Those who did so were subjected to no penalties as regards any real property they might possess within the limits allowed by Persian law. Many British subjects omitted, however, through ignorance or ineptitude to take the necessary steps to divest themselves of their Persian nationality within the prescribed period and after much discussion the Persian Government agreed at the end of 193^ to grant a further period of grace during which sucn British subjects might shed their Persian nationality. 9. The Persian Government insisted, however, t .at this change of nationality should take place, not under/«• under those articles of the lav/ which were originally applicable to the British subjects in question (and under which theywould have been free to choose either Persian or British nationality and to have kept their property), but under the article (Article XIII) applic able to natural-born Persian subjects who wish for any reason to acquire a foreign nationality. One of the conditions attached to the acceptance of applications under this article is that the person concerned shall dispose of his real property to Persian subjects within a period of one year, even if such property can be held by other foreigners (e.g. for residential and business purposes). T his is a longer period than was allowed in the law of January 29th, 1931, but there are on the other hand no safeguards for the owners' interests. The Persian Government declined to waive this condition in the case of the British subjects who proposed to take advantage of the period of grace, but there can be no doubt that they were within their legal rights in doing so ana that there is no real comparison between the Persians now in Bahrain and those British subjects who were obliged through their own dilatoriness to appeal for leave to divest themselves of their Persian nationality under Article XIII. (Sgd.) L. Baggallay 2/4/35.P.Z.2494/35. t Mr. Glauson. Please see the minute and draft letter below on the subject of the proposal to issue a Bahrein Nationality Law. 1 think that this is a question which will have to be discussed at a meeting with the Resident a^the Foreign Oifice before we can usefully proceed very much further. The dilemma in which we now find ourselves is as follows:- Mr. Laithwaite suggest-Gclin his minute that we should, in the first instance, secure the enaction of a Bahrein Nationality Law on the lines of Sections (1) - (4) of paragraph 3 of the Residents express letter of 2nd March (P.Z.1826/35), and that the question of making a separate proclamation on the lines of section (5) of paragraph 3 of the Resident's letter^to the effect that foreigners whose own Governments prohibit the ownership of real property by foreigners should be prohibited from owning land and property in Bahrein except within the limits required for their residence, trade or craft, be considered later. This is open to the objection mentioned by Mr. Walton in his pencil note below, viz. that even if we increase the j fee lor the registration of foreigners at the Agency a number j of Persians will register themselves as foreigners when the new Nationality Law is published and that they would then have a justifiable grievance if a law prohibiting them „ U&gt;Oul from owning real property made afterwards. There is, perhaps, a good deal to be said for enacting a penal provision of this kind at Bahrein by way of retaliation against the Persians for their treatment of Bahreinis in Persia^ -#ut if a provision of this sort is to be made, it must, I think, for/2 . for the reason pointed out by Mr. Walton, be enacted as part of, or at the same time as the Nationality Law. On the other hand we do not want to have a law enacted containing this penal provision regarding the ownership of real property until we have fully considered how it would affect Saudi subjects living in Bahrein, since the Saudi Government have recently introduced regulatxons prohibiting the private ownership of real property in the Hedjaz by foreigners. It seems, in fact, to be f-aa-gly clear that Saudi subjects would certainly be penalised by the provision suggested in section (5) of paragraph 3 of the Residents letter. A file regarding the Saudi regulations is attached. The Foreign Office will be the best people to give advice on technical points about the form of the^j^roposed do not much like the schemejKyt. the draft law suggested by the Resident. It seems to me that the first clause of the ~~ on the following lines:- 'The following are considered to be Bahrein subjects: (1) Persons born in Bahrein whose fathers are Bahreinis. (2) Persons born in Bahrein whose fathers are foreigners, unless such persons are registered at the Political Agency. (3) The descendants born abroad of Bahrein subjects for two generations.'

Please see previous submission on P.Z.. 7052/34 below. On that paper we forwarded for the consideration of the Government of India, and the Political Resident a suggestion by the Foreign Office that it might be well (a) to frame definite nationality laws in a reasonably complete form for Bahrein (and other States in a similar position in the Persian Gulf area); (b) to revise the Bahrein Oraer-in-Council on the same general lines as tne recent Koweit Order-in-Council. 2. The Political Resident promises a further communication on the second point. As regards the first, he is in favour of a nationality law ana in^: 3^ his express letter of 2nd torch, on P.z.1826/35, has suggested a draft. He anticipates no difficulty in persuading the Sheikh to issue a proclamation embodying the text of the law. The Government of India agree with tne Resident and support the text recommended by him. They promise a further communication as regards a nationality law for Koweit. 3. PfrgfrgraEh 1 of tne a raft of the law, contained in paragraph 3 of Colonel Fowle's express letter of 2nd torch merely reproduces the proclamation issued by tne Sheikh in 1929 to tne effect that persons born in Bahrein of foreign parents unless registered at the Political Agency would be considered for all purposes as subjects of the Bahrein State.

Para 5 raises a point of some difficulty. It provides for a prohibition of ownership of land ana property in Bahrein 'except within the limits required for their residence, trade or craft' by foreigners whose governments prohibit the ownership of real property by foreigners. This is, of course, ai med ag ainst Persia, whose legislation embodies such a law which has given rise to considerable difficulty in connection with Bahreinis in Persia. The question of retaliatory action against the Persian Government has come up from time to time and the suggestion that, so long as Persia refuses to allow Bahreinis to hold land in Persia,the Bahrein Government should make a corresponding provision in respect of the large number! of Persians in Bahrein has been mooted. But the Government of India were in the past opposed to it on the ground that, however improper the action of the Persian Government, overt and positive discrimination , against them on these lines could not be tolerated. They see, however, no objection to the draft now S proposed by the Resident, since it is in general terms and applies to all foreigners. But here we are faced with a further difficulty, which is that tne Saudi Government have recently made regulations (wnich were badly drafted and the effect of which is not quite clear), the general result of which appears to be to prohibit the ownership of real property in the Hejaz by foreigners.Minute Paper. - 3 - 36 % Department* 5. A further point which arises in connection with the Resident*s draft is whether it is really suitable to include in a nationality law a penal provision of the type discussed in the preceding paragraph. I am inclined to think: that it would he much better to make the nationality law on the general lines of the first four paragpftpne of the Residents draft (if the Foreign Office agree) and leave the penal provision to be embodied in a separate proclamation. This would also give us time to ascertain more precisely the position in regard to the Saudi regulations. 6. a draft letter to tne Foreign Office is attached.Draft Paper. political Department. .FT LLTTSR Sir, U.S.S., F.O. {v-T f.

Subject to the observations of tne 3/3 for F.A. Sir Samuel Hoare is disposed to think that paragraphs of the/L^z/wv dra^t-—t-grw suggested in para.3 of Bushire express letter of 2nd larch, No.244-3, generally suitable. 3. a point of more difficulty arises in regard to of the political Hesident^s—dm^t-. The 3/3 has every sympathy with the Resident's desire to enable the Bahrein Govt, to subject Persian subjects in Bahrein to the general/ 3436a 6006 1.35:ed a. general disabilities In regard to the ownership of property as operate in regard to Bahrein subjects in Persia, and he agrees also that if it is possible to state those disabilities in general terms as applying to foreigners of all nationalities and not to Persia only ; the political difficulties which might otherwise arise as a result of provisions expressly and by name direct against Persian subjects would be avoided. On the other hand, he is in the first place disposed to think that a provision of this nature might more suitably be issued as a separate proclamation and that it would be inappropriate to include it in a . rC’cw*- nationality law. apart from this,Che is not entirely satisfied, as at present advised, that the penalties proposed might not affect gi considerable number of Saudi subjects. The precise intention and effect of the Saudi regulations regarding real property is still to some extent obscure^and from Jedda despatch No.40 of 12th February and connected papers it appears that some modification of them may be introduced in the light of further consideration by the Saudi Govt. But for the moment it would appear that their effect is to prohibit the acquisition by a foreigner of real property in the Hejaz, save for the purpose of converting 'j tr-sy.Draft Paper.

The reasons for (5) are two-fold j (a) to meet the danger under (4) of registration en masse by Persians who on the issue of the Nationality haw would certainly prefer to come under the agency as foreigners than under i&gt;he Bahrain Gov.i’um.nt. Unuer (6) Persians would have to choose .. &lt; V between continuing their iersian nationality and parting with their property* and those of substance are ..ore likely to cling to their property than to their nationality* (b). To give the Bahrain Goveriment some much needed satisfaction in treating Fersian subjects in Bahrain exactly the /-3- y ) the safl^e - with regard to property * as Bahrain subjects are treated in Persia. In this connection it may he noted that clause (6) is less drastic than the - ereian law since it does not force foreigners who wish to retain their status as such to leave the country, 6# To pursue the analogy of (6), in principle there would appear to be no tiling to prevent the Government of India promulgating a similar law which would pre^fhnt i ersiana owning property in India in the same way that British Indian subjects are not allowed to own property in Persia. Tills is, however, a mat .ar which is outside the scope of this letter. 7. British subjects, British Indian subjects, Americans, and other foreigners, whose Governments allowed the possession of land by foreigners, would not be afiacted, anu the measure vis 1 vis the Persian Government being reciprocal could easily be deiended. Saudi subjects mi &amp; ht be affected but I am not clear what the Saudi Government law is on the subject of .^foreigners owning property. 8.

To prevent such mass registration it would be feasible to increase the registration fee over that of Re.l/- per annum which is required from British Indian subjects.

The present position is that applicants are not refused but they are very few in number. 10. when the proposal for a Nationality haw is put before the Shaikh of Bahrain, he will, of course, consult his family, with the inevitable result that the proposal will probadij become public property. The possibility of mass registration, perhaps of thousands of .erefans, will then arise during the interval between discussion of the proposal and its being actually promulgated as law. To meet this, which would largely defeat the object of the law, the Political Agent would have to be instructed to refuse registration. sd. T.C.Fowle, Lieut.-Colonel.

(1) The question of a Bahrein Nationality Law has been touched on in connection with the question of the position of Bahreinis in Persia, and it would probably be convenient as suggested by the Foreign Office if we had a Nationality Law for Bahrein in a reasonably complete form. On the other hand it will not be necessary to have a Nationality Law of a very elaborate kind at Bahrein. It appears that the only machinery for legislation at present available to the Bahrein Government consists in proclamations or decrees issued by the Sheikh. It is proposed to ask the Foreign Office for their views as to the scope of the Nationality Law which they suggest. (2) With regard to the preparation of a new Bahrein Order in Council the Foreign Office suggested,at the time when the preparation of the new Koweit Order in Council was being undertaken,that the Bahrein Order might also with advantage be revised on the same lines. There seems to be no great danger at present of our having trouble with the Sheikh of Bahrein or with any foreign Government over the question of the Political Agent’s jurisdiction over foreigners and in view of this, while the account of the position given in paragraph 3 of the X Foreign Office letter appears to be quite accurate, the point is, as the Foreign Office themselves admit, rather an academic one at the present time. Nevertheless we may not always have so compiaecn? a Sheikh to deal with and we cannot afford that there should he any flaw in the/ 1the Political Agent’s jurisdiction. Subject to the concurrence of the Government of India and of the Political Resident, we might, I think, concur in the Foreign Office proposal to revise the existing Order-in- Council. The revision of the Order will be to some extent affected by the form of the proposed nationality law and it is suggested that we might await the views of the Foreign Office on the latter before consulting the Government of India and the Resident on both proposals. When the Koweit Order^, although the first draft v/as prepared in India,/was revised^ almost all the amendments were suggested by the Foreign Office or this office, and since it is proposed to revise the Bahrein Order on similar lines, it will probably be most convenient to produce the first draft here.

The G.of I. will however observe that the secretary of State for Foreign Affairs/suggested consideration of the desirability (a) of framing definite nationality laws in a reasonably complete form for Bahrein (and other States in a similar position in the Persian Gulf area); and (b) of revising the Bahrein Order in council on the same general lines as the recent draft Koweit Order in Council. 3. The Secretary of state is disposec prima facie to think that in the circumstances/M a. ttw circumstances discussea in ^Foreign Office letter of 16th November there y^i^ky wmfej be some advantage both in the preparation of a definite, nationality law for Bahrein (and possibly also Koweit) and in a revision of the Bahrein urder in Council on the lines suggested. Such a nationality law would presumably take the form of a proclamation or decree issued by the SheikhjTand would include a provision on the lines of the sheikh of Bahrein's proclamation of 1929, and a further provision that the descendants of Bahreinis born abroad for one or perhaps two generations should be considered as Bahrein subjects. Before considering the matter further he would, however, be glad to be favoured with the views of the Government of India and the Political Resident both on the question generally and in particular on the probable reaction of the sheikh of Bahrein land the Sheikh of Koweit, if it was thought desirable to approach His Excellency with a view to the preparation of a nationality law in respect of his State) towards action on these lines. Should the Government of India and the Resident see advantage in such action, and should they anticipate no difficulty with the Rulers in question, the Secretary of state would then propose + /37g Draft Paper.

DRAFT LETTER. The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office. Sir, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to refer to Foreign Office letter No.E.6207/2369/91 of 16th November 1934 and to say that subject to t/k *.»► the e-enrnrrence. of the Government of India and of the Political Resident in /a IAJL* J&lt;JL~ the Persian Gulf he is disposed ^frcr-agree w±th the propooalti .of the Coagotagy ef State for Pn-rA-i pn AfPoi-ro hntVi nn tn fcJn p doeiraibiltty the issue of a definite Bahrein Nationality Law and erg' to the deoigftbifcifry of a revision of the existing Bahrein Order in Council. Z. It is clear that the important definitions of the terms M Bahrein subject” Council will be materially effected by the Bahrein Nationality Law which it is proposed to issue. While it is authorities may find some difficulty in the Government of India and the Political the Foreign Office on this question on v/r*wA_ 0 ^ and H foreigner' in a new Bahrein Order in suggested that the latter should be of a c cmparatively simple type, Sir Samuel Hoare feels that without guidance from His Majesty’s Government the local reaching a decision in regard to its exact scope and form. Before addressing Resident^he would accordingly be grateful if he might be favoured with the views of 3164 5000 10.34 which/which your Department is particularly well qualified to advise. The proposed law would presumably include a provision on the lines of the Sheikh of Bahrein’s proclamation of 1929 to the effect that persons born in Bahrein of foreign parents should be considered as Bahrein subjects unless registered at the Political Agency, and a further provision that the descendants of Bahreinis should be considered as Bahrein subjects for one or perhaps two generations born abroad, i. With regard to the revision of the Bahrein Order in Council it is probable that most of the amendments which it will be necessary to make in the existing Order in Council will be on the same lines as those which have already been incorporated in the new draft Koweit Order in Council, and in view of this Sir Samuel Hoare would suggest that it might be convenient on this occasion if the first draft of the new Bahrein Order in Council were prepared by this Department in consultation with the foreign Office and then forwarded to the Government of India and the Political Resident for any further amendments which they may desire to suggest. On receipt of Sir John Simon’s views on the subject of the proposed Nationality Law the secretary of State proposes to consult the Government of India and the Political Resident on both the proposals made in your letter of 16th November under reference.vcn In any further communication on this subject, please quote £ No. E 6207/2369/91 and address— not to any person by name. but to— “ The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, K ''N London, S.W.l. 2&gt;%o 7fjfv/ Foreign Office. S.W.l. 16th November, 1934. Sir, (5) 'oV- s&gt; Z ff w With reference to India Office letter No. P.Z. 5811/34 of the 5th October, 1934, regarding the registration of foreigners in Bahrain, I am directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to request you to inform Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare that he concurs generally in the views expressed in that letter and in the action which Sir Samuel Eoare proposes to take in this matter. 2. While, however, Sir John Simon is prepared to accept the view put forward by the Government of India in paragraph 2 of their express letter No. F 118 - N/33 of the 3rd September to the India Office that the Sheikh f s proclamation of 1929, which was reissued in 1933, to the effect that persons born in Bahrain of foreign parents shall be considered as subjects of the Bahrain State unless registered at the Political Agency, should be regarded as a Bahrain nationality law, he considers that it would nevertheless be more satisfactory if this proclamation were to be issued expressly and in terms as a nationality law so that there could be no doubt as to its character. It appears to him desirable for other reasons also that Bahrain and other similar protected States should have definite nationality laws in a reasonably complete form. Bahrainis are to be found in other parts of the world, many of them have children/ ■nJ The Under Secretary of State, India Office.i?7j children horn there, and their right to British protection depends on whether they possess Bahrain nationality. It is quite undefined at the moment to what extent Bahrain nationality must he held to he retained in the case of persons horn abroad. 3. There is one further point arising out of this correspondence to which Sir John Simon wishes to invite the attention of Sir Samuel Hoare. It appears to have heen assumed hy the Political Resident and hy the Government of India that the present jurisdiction exercised hy His Majesty’s Government over foreigners in Bahrain rests upon Sheikh Isa’s letter of the 16th July, 1909. Sir John Simon feels some douht as to whether this is in fact so. It is quite true that in that letter Sheikh Isa requested that His Majesty’s Government ’’should exercise authority in all cases in which ’’the foreigners only are concerned, hut not in other cases”, fab Sir Samuel Hoare is aware, however, in 1912 the Sheikh explained that he did not intend to include in the designation ’’foreigners” the dependents of petty Arab potentates in the Persian Gulf, a condition which was eventually accepted hy His Majesty’s Government in 1919. Now, under Article 8 of the Bahrain Order in Council of 1913, the Political Agent was given jurisdiction over, inter alios , ’’foreigners with respect ”to whom the Sheikh has agreed with His Majesty for, or ’’consented to, the exercise of jurisdiction hy His Majesty”. It would appear, therefore, that immediately subsequent to His Majesty’s Government’s acceptance of the Sheikh’s explanation in 1919 the position was that the Political Agent could not exercise jurisdiction over all foreigners, since His/His Majesty’s Government had agreed with the Sheikh to except from that term the subjects of the Arab rulers referred to above. In practice, however, this arrangement proved unworkable, notably in regard to Nejdis, and in 1920 it proved necessary, without the Sheikh’s consent, to issue a notice announcing that all foreign subjects, including Persians and subjects of Arab rulers and Chiefs, other than those of Bahrain, were, while in Bahrain, entitled to British protection. There thus resulted a position in which His Majesty’s Government, in apparent conflict with Article 8 of the Bahrain Order in Council of 1913, were claiming jurisdiction over certain foreigners with respect to whom the Sheikh had not consented to the exercise of jurisdiction by His Majesty. But this anomalous position may perhaps be regarded as having lasted only during the brief remainder of Sheikh Isa’s rule. The present Sheikh, Sheikh Hamad, has never, so far as Sir John Simon is aware, demurred to the exercise of jurisdiction by the Political Agent over all the foreigners in Bahrain, nor to the terms of the 1920 notice establishing that jurisdiction, even though he may not specifically have agreed with His Majesty's Government for the exercise of such jurisdiction. Strictly speaking therefore, the position appears to be that the present jurisdiction of His Majesty's Government over all foreigners in Bahrain rests not on Sheikh Isa’s letter of 1909, but on the Political Agent's notice of 1920, as subsequently accepted, or not demurred to by the present Sheikh of Bahrain. 4. The point is perhaps an academic one in relation to the present case. Nevertheless it will be seen from the foregoing// 3 S 3 !.n\ foregoing review that the position with regard to jurisdiction over foreigners under the existing Bahrain Order in Council is too uncertain and indefinite to he satisfactory at the present time with the development of the Bahrain oil concession and of the Arab coast air route, when the presence of an increasing number of foreigners in Bahrain is to be expected, and it is particularly desirable that there should be no question about the matter of jurisdiction. The Bahrain Order in Council in its present form makes the jurisdiction of the British courts depend upon the agreement of the Sheikh, and the Sheikh f 3 agreement to the jurisdiction which His Majesty’s Government at present actually claim is left rather as a matter of inference. Sir John Simon would suggest, therefore, for the consideration of Sir Samuel Hoare, that the Bahrain Order in Council should be amended on the same lines as the recent draft Koweit Order in Council, and that the Order itself should specify in terms who are the persons who are subject to the jurisdiction of the court; and that as in the case of the Koweit Order, the assent of the Sheikh should be obtained to the terms of the Order in Council as revised. In this connexion Sir Samuel Hoare will recall that, when the revision of the Koweit Order in Council in respect of this point was undertaken, that Order was found to be out of date and unsatisfactory in many other respects, and nearly all the criticisms of the former Koweit Order in Council apply also to the existing Bahrain Order. Sir John Simon would, therefbre suggest further that, if the proposal to revise those provisions of the Bahrain Order in Council which deal with the/the jurisdiction of the Agency courts over foreigners in Bahrain is accepted by Sir Samuel Hoare, the opportunity might he taken to make a thorough revision of that Order on the lines of the new Koweit Order in Council.

' / Please see the Government of Indian Express letter of 3rd September at P.Z. 5306/34, about the registration of foreigners at Bahrein. This correspondence arises out of the discovery which we accidentally made last year that the Bahrein Government had issued a proclamation in February, 1929, to the effect that persons born in Bahrein of foreign parents would, unless registered in the Agency, be considered for all purposes as subjects of the Bahrein State. Although the proclamation is not discriminatory in form, it appears that the persons really affected by it are the children of Persians who form the chief foreign community residing permanently in Bahrein. The Political Agent describes this community as H a fruitful source of petty litigation in the Agency courts”, and there seems no objection in principle to the proclamation, the effect of which will be to transfer a certain number of these persons to the jurisdiction of the Sheikh of Bahrein. Cases of Europeans bom in and resident in Bahrein must be practically non-existent and in any such case it would be quite easy to ensure that the person in . question registered at the Political Agency. The Foreign Office in their letter of 16th November, 1933 (P.Z. 7457/33) saw no objection in principle to the terms of the Bahrein Governments proclamation, but suggested that, since the jurisdiction of the Agency courts over all foreigners under Article 3 of the Bahrein Order in Council appeared to be affected, the point should be made clear by an exchange of formal communications between the Political Agent and the Sheikh. It appears, however, from the correspondence now received (P.Z.5123/34) that the proclamation was in fact/ 2621 6000 3 34fact issued by the Bahrein Government after consultation with the Political Agent, who issued a simultaneous notification in similar terms. In these circumstances there is no necessity for the exchange of coromuni cat ions suggested by the Foreign Office, but since the Political Agent’s notification of February, 1929, was issued on the instructions of the then Political Resident without reference to higher authority, it might be as well to regularise the position by issuing formal instructions to the Political Agent for the registration of foreigner where necessary in pursuance of the 1929 arrangements. Colonel Fowle in his despatch of 13th July (P. Z. 5123/34) tiwrtrks that the Bahrein Government’s proclamation.infringedL the grant of jurisdiction over all foreigners ceded by the Sheikh to H.M.G. in 1909 s (see paragraph 7 of Mr. Laithwaite’s note at flag C ), but the Government of India disagree with the Resident on this point and regard the proclamation as a perfectly legitimate application of the ius loci , which operates in effect as a Bahreini Nationality Law. We may, I think, agree with this view though it is, of course, true that the proclamation reduces the number of foreigners coming under the jurisdiction of the Agency courts.

Since, however, this appears to be a matter of some importance, affecting the jurisdiction of the Agency Courts, under article 8 of the Order-in-Council, Sir John Simon would suggest that, if the Sheikh of Bahrain definitely wishes that His Majesty should only exercise jurisdiction over foreigners born in Bahrain on condition that such foreigners register at the Political Agency, and if some form of registration for foreigners has to be reintroduced for this purpose, the point should be made clear by an exchange of formal communications between the Political Agent and the Sheikh and formal instructions should be sent to the Political Agent to register such foreigners.

India Office P. 163-/30' Exercise of Jurisdiction in Cases affecting Foreign Subjects in Bahrein by the British Political Authorities. Jurisdiction over British Subjects. 1. Article 4 of the Convention of 1861 between the Sheikh of Bahrein and the British Government provides that “ all offences which they {British subjects) may commit, or which may be committed against them, shall be reserved for the decisions of the British Resident, provided the British Agent located at Bahrein shall fail to adjust them satisfactorily.” Jurisdiction in Cases affecting Foreigners. 2. By the Agreement of 22nd December 1880 and the Exclusive Agreement of 13th March 1802, the Sheikh bound himself not to enter into any agreement or correspondence with any Governments other than His Majesty’s Government; not to allow the Agents of such Governments to reside within bis territory without the assent of His Majesty’s Government; and not to alienate, mortgage, or give for occupation any part of his territories save to His Majesty’s Government. Responsibility for the protection of foreigners in Bahrein may be regarded as bavin g passed to IIis Majesty’s Government as a corollary to these two Agreements. But the question of jurisdiction does not appear to have arisen in an active form until 1900. In December of that year the Assistant Political Agent, Bahrein, reported that a German subject, Mr. Wonckhaus, intended to open a branch of his business in Bahrein. The Political Resident suggested that, in the event of any mercantile or other cases arising between Bahreini subjects and Mr. Wonckhaus or his agent, the Assistant Political Agent should be instructed to deal with such cases as if they were cases between British subjects and subjects of the Sheikh. Mr. Wonckhaus and his agent, if a foreigner and not a native Indian subject of His Majesty, must be regarded as liable in such cases to the jurisdiction of the Sheikh. “ As, however, the Sheikh is bound, under treaty, not to admit the consular agencies of other nations without the consent of the British Government, it is expedient that the British representative should, as a matter of courtesy, extend his good offices to European foreigners in any disputes between them and the Chief of Bahrein or his subjects, and, in the event of necessity, he should claim to protect all such foreigners as he would a British subject. I am to request that Mr. Gaskin may be instructed to this effect.” The action taken by the Government of India was subsequently approved by His Majesty’s Government. 4. In June 1903, the question having arisen of the purchase by Mr. Wonckhaus of certain premises in Bahrein which he had hitherto held on a temporary lease, the Government of India instructed the Political Resident as follows :—“ In view ... of the belief which Mr. Wonckhaus is reported to hold that, in the event of his acquiring property, he will not be amenable to local law, but will be subject to the extra-territorial jurisdiction of Courts of his own country (though there are none such with local jurisdiction in Bahrein), the Government of India approve your proposal to warn the Sheikh of Bahrein that no such acquisition can give to any Consul or other representative of a foreign nation the right to enter into direct relations with the Chief, and that, should any such official address the Chief, he should be referred to the British authorities. The position should also be clearly explained to Mr. Wonckhaus.” 4371 75 3.30 Lr. d. 4 May 1901, No. 708 E.A., end. in G. of I. Desp. 72, of 9 May 1901 P. 614/01.

In 1.904-5 two incidents affecting foreign subjects took place in the Islands. In the first of these, a German subject—an employee of Messrs. Wonckhaus—became involved in a brawl, in the course of which he suffered personal injuries. Failing, as he thought, to secure adequate redress through the Political Agent, to whom his first complaint, was addressed, Mr. Wonckhaus made representations to the German Consul at Basra, who addressed the Sheikh direct on the subject. His Excellency, in reply, acknowledged the letter and added, “ I have now to inform you that this matter is before the British Government, and I cannot say anything on the subject.” The Foreign Office at a later stage instructed the Charge d’Affaires at Berlin that, should representations be made to him in the matter by the German Government, he should state that it had been brought to the notice of His Majesty’s Government, and that a British ship would be sent to Bahrein in order that an inquiry might be instituted. The German Government do not appear to have taken any action. The German Consul at Basra subsequently thanked the Political Resident “for your efficient help to the German firm, which, I trust, settles the case.” G. In the second case (November 1901), an accidental quarrel having arisen between a retainer of the Sheikh’s nephew and a Persian, attacks were made upon Persian subjects in Bahrein. Apprehensive that the Sheikh would endeavour to deal with the case in the local Courts, they telegraphed for support to the Shah, and conversations took place between His Majesty’s Minister and the Mushir-ud-Dowleh, as the result of which the latter telegraphed to the Persian community urging them to keep calm, as “ I have had a long talk with the British Minister . . . and I am sure he will take early steps to get the affairs settled and the culprit punished.” The Sheikh, however, adopted an uncompromising attitude on the question of jurisdiction, maintaining that he would not admit any interference “ in cases between Arabs and Persians, who were all Mohammedans,” and that they must go before the local Shara Courts, which, composed as they were of Sunnis, were unlikely to do justice 10 the Shiah Persians. Argument proving unavailing, an ultimatum was presented to ilis Excellency. He accepted the demands of His Majesty’s Government, and though no specific reference to the point was made in the ultimatum, the jurisdiction of the Political Agent appears thenceforth to have been definitely established, as a a matter of practice, in respect of British and foreign subjects in Bahrein. 7. Correspondence took place between 1908 and 1911 in regard to the preparation of an Order in Council to confer jurisdiction over British subjects and foreigners in the Islands on the Political Agent at Bahrein. It was decided that it was desirable to obtain a formal request from the Sheikh that he should be relieved of jurisdiction over foreigners. After discussion with the Political Agent, His Excellency addressed the latter on 10 th July 1909, in the following terms:—“ After compliments. It is not hidden from you that 1 have had considerable trouble in many cases (that arose) in my territory in which foreigners were involved. For this reason I wish that I may not be held responsible in these cases, and I would be grateful to British Government if they remove this trouble and responsibility from me. I mean that it (the British Government) should exercise authority in all cases in which the foreigners only are concerned, but not in other cases ; and in cases that occur between foreigners and my subjects, it is necessary that you and 1 should settle them jointly.” 8 . The Political Resident remarked, with reference to the reservation contained in the concluding sentence of the Sheikh’s letter, “As its effect is simply that such cases will be disposed of by the joint Court, and gives foreigners the same treatment that British subjects now receive, there seems no need for exception to be taken to it.” 9. The Sheikh subsequently represented that his letter of 10th July 1909, giving jurisdiction over foreigners to the British Government, was intended only “to cover subjects of recognised Powers and not the dependents of petty Arab potentates in Gulf, with some of whom he claimsto have special arrangements providing for reciprocal acceptance of each others direct jurisdiction. I informed him that if he could produce agreements, and if the other parties, on being referred to, acknowledged their validity, I thought we should be prepared to recognise them . . ^ the light of the protest in question, the wording of the Draft Order in Council was amended to its present form, under which (Article 8 of the Order in Council of 1913) the power conferred by the Order extends “ to the persons and matters following in so far as by Treaty, grant, usage, sufferance, or other lawful means, His Majesty has jurisdiction in relation to such persons, matters, and things, that is to say :— (1) 1 British subjects as herein defined within the limits of this Order. (2) foreigners with respect to idiom the Sheikh of Bahrein has agreed icith His Majesty for, or consented to, the exercise of jurisdiction by His Majesty. (3) Bahrein subjects registered in the Political Agency as being in the regular service of British subjects or foreigners ; with the proviso that all cases wherein such Bahrein subjects are concerned shall be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of Part Y of this Order. (4) The expression ‘person to whom this Order applies’ shall be construed in accordance with the above three sub-Articles. (5) 1 he property and all personal or proprietary rights and liabilities within the said limits of British subjects and of foreigners within sub-Artiele (2) and of Bahrein subjects within sub-Article (3), whether such persons are themselves within or without the limits of this Order. ( 6 ) British ships and ships belonging to foreigners within sub- Article (2) with their boats, and the persons and property on board thereof, or belonging thereto, being within the limits of this Order; provided that jurisdiction over foreign ships shall not be exercised otherwise than according to the practice of the High Court in Kngland m the exercise of jurisdiction over foreign ships. (7) If any question arises whether the subjects or citizens of any country, State, or tribe have or have not been placed under the jurisdiction of His Majesty by agreement with, or the consent of, the Sheikh of Bahrein, it shall be referred by the Court to the Political Resident, and a certificate under his hand and seal shall be conclusive on the question and judicial notice shall be taken thereof.” 10. Part V of the Order, to which reference is made in Article 8 quoted above, deals with the important class of case, whether civil or criminal, in which the parties are respectively a Bahrein subject and a person to whom the Order applies. The procedure laid down in it is as follows :— “ (a) Criminal. Article 4-1.—(1) When a Bahrein subject desires to institute a complaint against a person to whom this Order applies, or a person to whom this Order applies desires to institute a complaint against a Bahrein subject, the Political Agent shall entertain the same, and may— (a) with the concurrence of the Sheikh of Bahrein, himself hear and determine it in his District Court, or (b) send it to the Joint Court, or (c) if the defendant is a Mahommedan, refer it to a Kazi for decision, sending a representative of the Agency to record briefly the proceedings. Such decision, when endorsed by the Political Agent, shall for all purposes be considered as if it were that of the District Court. ( 2 ) Nothing in this Article shall prevent the Political Resilient from exercising the revisory powers possessed by him under Article 4 of the Convention with Bahrein, dated the 31st May 1801.* * See para. 1 above. Viceroy’s iel. to S. of S. for India of 6 July 1912, re peating tel. from Pol. Res.: P. 2632/12.4 (b) Civil. Article 45.—(1) When a Bahrein subject desires to bring a snit against a person to whom this Order applies, or a person to whom this Order applies desires to bring a suit against a Bahrein subject, the Political Agent shall admit the complaint, and (a) with the concurrence of the Sheikh of Bahrein, may hear and determine the suit in his District Court, or (b) may hear and determine it in a Joint Court, or (c) may refer it to the Majlis-el-Urf for decision, or (d) in cases between pearling-masters and divers, may refer it to the Salifah Court, or (e) with the consent of the several parties, may refer the case to one or more Arbitrators for settlement. ( 2 ) The judgment of the Joint Court or of the Majlis-el-Urf shall for all purposes be considered the same as if it were that of the District Court. (3) An appeal from the decision of the Salifah Court shall lie to the Political Agent acting in concert with the Sheikh of Bahrein, and in all Salifah cases their joint decision shall be final. (4) The award of the Arbitrator under Sub-Article 1 (e) shall be final, and shall not be open to appeal unless the same shall within a reasonable time have been ordered by the Political Agent, to be set aside on the ground that it is not final or is defective, or that the Arbitrator has exceeded his authority, or has been guilty of misconduct in the matter. (5) Nothing herein mentioned shall prevent the District Court, the Joint Court, the Majlis-el-Urf, the Salifah Court, or the Arbitrator from referring any matter in the progress of a suit which involves a point of Mahommedan law to a Nazi for decision, or from sending any party or witness, being a Mahommedan, to a Kazi for the administration of an oath.” P. 5040/20.

At no subsequent stage does the Sheikh appear to have shown any signs of going back on his delegation of responsibility in respect of foreigners other than the subjects of States in the Persian Gulf, to His Majesty’s Government. Difficulties, however, arose in the post-war period in connection with his claim to exercise jurisdiction over Nejdis and inhabitants of El Katr. In 1920 protests were received from Ibn Sand as to the exercise of jurisdiction by the Sheikh over Nejdi subjects. A similar protest appears to have been made at about the same time by the Sheikh of Qatr, both parties requesting the Political Agent to exercise jurisdiction on their behalf. The Political Agent in consequence issued on 20th November 1920 a notice that all foreign subjects, including Persians and subjects of Arab Pulers and Chiefs other than those of Bahrein, were, while in Bahrein, entitled to British protection. The decision was not well received by the Sheikh ; but it has not been contested by him, and since 1920 jurisdiction over all foreign subjects has rested with the British Political authorities within the limits of the Orders in Council of 1913 and 1922, as subsequently amended.

Only eighteen persons (no Persians) have been so 'registered”. But registration in this matter has too legal a tang.

We are a little puzzled as precisely what is involved. As you may remember, there was considerable correspondence in 1931 on the subject of the registration of British protected persons in Bahrein by the Political regent unuer the Order in Council, and it was finally decided that the Political Agent COPY SENT BY AIR MAIL snould be instructed to register British protected persons proper, such as subjects of Indian States, who reside or make a prolonged stay in the Islands, but that tnere would ;be little point in registering the 1712a 5000 3.3C floating/H floating population at Bahrein, ana your Heport on the working of the L Bahrein Order in Council for the year 1932 makes it clear that foreigners under British protection are not j registered. 3.

No. 26-B of 1933. With reference to your telegram No. 34 of the 6 th May 1933, I have the honour to state that in reply to an enquiry addressed to the Political Agent, which the Persian Government have received through the Governor of the Gulf Ports is in each case incorrect. The facts are:- (i) On the 27th February 1929 the Government of Bahrain issued an f Alan (Proclamation) ordaining that persons born in Bahrain of foreign parents would, unless registered in the agency, be considered for all March 1933 the Bahrain Government reissued their T Alan of the 27th February 1929. 'these 1 Alans apply to Persians in the same way as to other foreigners residing in Bahrain. (ii) The Bahrain Petroleum Gompany Limited is a private Company and the labourers employed by the Company are neither recruited nor discharged by the Bahrain Government. 2. As regards the reply which you propose to make regarding the allegation that the Bahrein Government were dismissing Persians in the employ of the Bahrein Petroleum Company, I venture to point out that as Bahrain, Colonel Loch reports that the information purposes as subjects*of the Bahrain /bate. On the 30th the/ His Majestv f s Minister, Bri'tish Legation, TEHRAN.mm mm r J 47 the Oompany is theoretically a British Gompany - being registerea in Canada - though in practice it is American, it might not be politic to draw the attention of the Persian Government to the American connection of the Gompany lest they should seek to turn it to their advantage in pursuit of their claim to Bahrain. 3. Colonel Loch informs me that the Government of Bahrain would prefer that the reply should be so worded as to avoid the phrase 'copying the Persian Government”. I am sending a copy of this letter to His Majesty's Secretary of State for India and to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India. I have, etc., (Sgd). T.G. Fowle, Lt .-Colonel, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.To His Excellency the Right Honourable the Governor General of India in Council. My Lord, The proposals made in Your Excellency’s Secret letter No. 188, Proposed Order in Council con- dated the 14th November 1907, for ferring on the Political Agent at regularising the judicial powers Bahrein jurisdiction over British exercised by the Political Agent at subjects and foreigners m Bahrein. d • -l .-i • „ ^ , Bahrein, by the issue of an Order in Council placing both British subjects and foreigners under his jurisdiction, have been considered by His Majesty’s Government, in connection with the general question of the policy, political and com- meicial, to lie followed in the Persian Gulf in order to meet the change in the situation consequent upon the development of the Bagdad Railway scheme. o. The general conclusion at which His Majesty’s Government have ai rived is that the competition to which British trade in the Persian “ Gulf is exposed is not merely commercial, but has a distinctly political object. British claims to political predominance in the Gulf are “ based mainly upon the fact of our commercial interests having hitherto “ been predominant, and should our trade, as a result of a German “ forward commercial policy, be impaired, our political influence would “ proportionately diminish. It follows that purely political action on our part, not having as its objective the development of material British interests, might have a prejudicial effect, both politically and “ commercially, by reason of the suspicions it would be likely to rouse.” 3. The proposals which you have made for the extension of the jurisdiction of the Political Agent at Bahrein fall within the lines of policy approved by His Majesty’s Government. Their adoption would mark another stage in the development of the virtual protectorate which we exercise over Bahrein, to which the growing importance of the island as a centre of trade may be attributed. 4. It will tend to strengthen our position in Bahrein, and to remove risks of interference by other Powers, if jurisdiction over foreigners is placed in our hands. But our protectorate has never been formally notified, except to Turkey and Persia, and in the event of controversy arising with other Powers as to the assumption of jurisdiction over S. 9.their subjects by the Political Agent, it will be preferable that our action should be based on a request from the Sheikh to be relieved of the responsibility of exercising jurisdiction over foreigners. When this has been arranged, an Order in Council can be issued. It does not seem expedient to make the Order in Council the medium of formally declaring a protectorate over Bahrein. Persian and Turkish claims to the sovereignty of the island have been repudiated by us in a form to preclude the necessity of any further discussion of the question with them. But neither Turkey nor Persia has formall} 7 ' abandoned its claims, and the Persian Government have not recognised, though we have consistently asserted, our right to protect Bahreinis in Persian territory. In the present political conditions of Turkey and Persia it is clear that we should scrupulously avoid any action that could be represented as an attempt to utilise their difficulties for selfish purposes. There is also the risk that the formal declaration of a protectorate might be regarded as a challenge by other Powers than Persia and Turkey, who might raise the question of our rights in a provocative form. 5. I request that the Political Agent at Bahrein may be instructed to approach the Sheikh, with the object of obtaining from him, as a necessary preliminary to the issue of the Order in Council, a request that the British Government will relieve him of the responsibility of exercising jurisdiction over foreigners in the island. 6 . As regards British subjects, no difficulty arises in respect of the proposed Order in Council in view of the terms of Article 4 of the r l reaty of 1861, and of the usage that has been established. 7. It will be convenient that the first draft of the Order in Council should be prepared by Your Excellency’s Government, with a view to providing for any local peculiarities that may require consideration.

Strictly speaking, how- ever, he has no legal authority for undertaking these latter duties. Fide enclosure No. 3.2 3. With a view to define and regularise the powers exercised over British . . subjects by the Agent, the Political Vide paragraph 6 of enclosure No. 5. t&gt;*j l ' n n • Resident in the Persian Gulf* has put forward the suggestion that he should be appointed to be a Justice of the Peace and endowed with the powers of a District Judge in direct subordination to the High Court of Bombay. We concur in this recommendation, but with reference to clause 2 of the Indian Foreign Jurisdiction Order in Council, 1902, we under stand that it would first be necessary for Bahrein to be declared by His Majesty in Council to be a territory in which jurisdiction is exercised by, or on behalf of His Majesty through the Governor-General in Council. We would accordingly request that, if His Majesty’s Government see no objection, the necessary Order in Council may be passed providing for the exercise of jurisdiction in Bahrein. 4. But, further, in view of the increase of foreign shipping and foreign interest generally in the Gulf, and of the establishment of foreign firms and missions in Bahrein, which has already caused practical difficulties, it seems desirable that, if possible, in maintenance of the status quo in the Gulf provision should be made in the Order in Council for the exercise by the Political Agent of jurisdiction over foreigners in Bahrein, before foreign interests have so largely developed as to render the assumption of the leml duties of a protecting power a matter of greater intricacy and difficulty involving perhaps, as in the case of Zanzibar, diplomatic representations to foreign powers.

He reports that the fees leviable for the ser vices thus rendered would have amounted to £8-17-6 according to the scale of Consular fees, had he possessed authority to levy such fees. 2 . So far as the issue of bills of health, noting of Marine protests, etc , are concerned, such acts can only be performed by officers possessing Consular rank, which the Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein, does not possess, and with which, in view of the political status of Bahrein, it will probably be incon venient to invest him. I do not, however, anticipate that much inconvenience will he experienced on this account, as the number of direct merchant vessels calling at Bahrein is not large. The mail steamers and most of the other mer chant vessels which call at Bahrein also visit Bushire, where application can be made for the performance of duties required under the Merchant Shipping Act. It will be better therefore, I think, that the Assistant Political Agent should in future inform masters of merchant vessels, who make applications to him, that he has no authority to perform duties of a Consular nature. 3. With regard to duties of a notarial nature such as the legalization of signatures, execution of powers-of-attorney, and other acts which might be required of a Notary Public, I think that it may be advisable that the AsWant Political Agent should be appointed by notification in the Gazette ofwnd a under the Negotiable Instruments Act, NXYI of 1881, to be a Notary Public for the islands of Bahrein, and authorized at the same time to levy fees to he credited to the Government of India, in accordance with the scale of fees levied under the provisions of the Persian Coasts and Islands Order in Council. 4. W T ith regard to the issue of passports, I propose to instruct the Assistant Political Agent to forward any applications which he may receive to me for disposal. No. 914-E.A., dated Simla, the 6th May 1902, From—J. B. Wood, Esq., I.C.S., Under-Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, To— Lieutenant-Colonel C. A. Kemball, Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 7, dated the 16th January 1902, requesting that the Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein may be appointed to be a Notary Public for the islands of Bahrein. 2. I am to point out that the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (XXVI of 1881), under which you propose to appoint Mr. Gaskin to be a Notary Public, has not been applied to Bahrein, and that there is not at present any authorised procedure by which it can be brought into general operation there. Moreover, the appointment of Mr. Gaskin to be a Notary Public under the Act would only constitute him a Notary Public for the purposes of that specitic enactment, and would not authorise him, as you apparently suppose, to do such other acts as might be required of a Notary Public. Special provision has been made by the Commissioners for Oaths Act, 1889 (52 Viet., c. 10 ), section 6 , for the perform ance of Notarial acts in foreign countries by diplomatic and Consular officers of His Majesty, and, though the law both in England and in India recognises certain acts of Public Notaries appointed by foreign authority, it is inexpedient to rely upon such authority for the appointment of a diplomatic officer of a class not specified in the statute. 3. In the circumstances above explained, it is a mrtter for consideration whether the Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein should not be invested with2 Consular powers which would enable him to perform the functions of a Notary Public by virtue of his office and, if you think that there is sufficient justifica tion for the grant of such powers, the Government of India will be prepared to consider any proposal which you may make to this effect. 4 . The Government of India are aware that the peculiar status of Bahrein may possibly render the investment of Mr. Gaskin with Consular powers a somewhat anomalous proceeding, but they are disposed to think that n o P rac * lca difficultv need be apprehended from the step, and that there may be advantages in providing for the exercise of power and jurisdiction over His Majesty s European subjects and others in Bahrein and on the southern shores of the Persian Gulf by an Order in Council similar to that which has been framed for Maskat and for the Persian Coasts and Islands. The Governor-General in Council will, therefore, be glad to he furnished with your opinion on this proposal, together with any alternative suggestions which you may have to offer. No. 10-S.A.., dated Shiraz, the 2nd July 1902. p r om Lieutenant-Colonel C. A. Kemball, Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No 914-E.A., dated 6th May, in which, after pointing out the impracticability of the proposal submitted by me for the investment of the Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein with certain notarial powers, yon say that it is a matter for consider ation whether the Assistant Political Agent should not be invested with Con sular powers which would enable him to perform the functions of a Notary Public by virtue of his office. 2. In my opinion, considering the requirements of Bahrein and the nature of our representation there, it is not necessary nor advisable ^at the Assistant Political Agent should have more than Vice-Consular rank, which could, , the case of the Vice-Consul at Bushire, be conferred on him by warrant of the Consul-General at Bushire. At piesent, however, the Consular jurisdiction of the Resident at Bushire does not extend beyond the Persian side of the Gulf and the islands appertaining thereto, and although the question of Consular jurisdictionfor Bahrein and the Arabian Coast of the Gulf was considered at the time when the Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council was drafted- mde paragraph 5 of the Despatch No. llO-External, dated 22nd July 1867, from thTGovernment of India, to the Secretary of State for India-it is not clear to me whether at that time the issue of a separate Order m Council for that side of the Gulf was contemplated. The simplest solution of the question would be to extend the Resident’s Consular jurisdiction in the required diree- tion without the issue of a separate Order in Council. He could then issue a warrant appointing Mr. Gaskin to be Vice-Consul at Bahrein. Mr. Gaskin would thus he enabled by virtue of his office to perform the f™c„,°ns of a Notary Public, and the powers conferred upon him would, for all the present practical requirements of Bahrein, be ample. It, however, a sep in Council is required, it should, I think, be framed with a view to extend the Resident’s Consular jurisdiction and not to create a separate and mdepende t Consular appointment as at Maskat. 3 . At the same time, I am inclined to doubt whether the requirements of the case justify the issue of a separate Order in &gt; Council to P™ v ide for Consular jurisdiction at Bahrein and the other places m the Gulf not alrea y provided for by Orders in Council. The Assistant Political Agent is already invested with magisterial powers in criminal cases over British Indian subjects, and there are at present no European British subjects at Bahrein. The want, therefore, of Consular jurisdiction has not hitherto been felt to a y appreciable extent, and the object of my letter No. 7, dateu 16th January, was merely to suggest that notarial powers should be conferred upon the Assistan Political Agent so as to enable him to perform certain notarial functions an levy fees for so doing. As a matter of fact, Courts m India are not, I think, likely to dispute the validity of the Assistant Political Agent s attestationHonuments and the question of the levy of fees is not of much importance If call-ent with no * 6 &lt; ^ I ' der '“l C T ounci ‘ is squired to invest the Assistant PolitN al A 7 K en . t ' It : h Co n suh r rank, I am disposed to think that there is at present no sufficient justification for the measure. p 4. In connection with the extension of Consular jurisdiction to Bahrein 40 b f r m ‘ nd that alt hough we have an agreement with the Chief of Bahrein whereby Foreign Consular Agencies cannot be es- tab.ished m Bahrein without the consent of the British'Government, it mav perhaps be inconvenient to maintain this position in the event of British Con sular jurisdiction beiu^ extended to Bahrein. The German Consul at Bushire informed me once in course of conversation that he considered his jurisdiction in the Gulf to extend wherever mine did, and I think he said that his instruc tions from his Government were to this effect. This point has not of course escaped the notice of the Government of India, but I mention it so as to make my present report as complete as possible.No. 76, dated Bushire, the 25th February (received 13th March) 1906. From Major P. Z. Cox, C.I,E , Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to refer to Foreign Department letter No. 708-E.A., dated the 4th May 1901, to the address of my predecessor, on the subject of the administration of justice in Bahrein in cases in which European foreigners are concerned. The instructions conveyed in the second paragraph of the letter were duly conveyed to the Assistant Political Agent, Mr. Gaskin, for guidance, but I am not sure whether, when the question was considered on that occasion, the time-honoured arrangement under which commercial justice has hitherto been administered in Bahrein, by a permanent native majlis, was familar to the Government of India ; and in any case the existing position at Manama makes me think it advisable to make another reference on the subject. 2. In the first place, I may mention that at the end of October last, Dr. Listemann who had then recently taken over the duties of German Consul at Bushire, spoke to me informally on the subject of the position of German subjects in Bahrein. He began by saying that he understood from the corres pondence on his records that the Residency would take exception to his addressing Sheikh Esa direct on behalf of a German subject in Bahrein. I replied in the affirmative, on the grounds that the foreign relations of the Chief were in our hands. He then went on to enquire what amount of pro tection we should consider it possible to afford to German subjects trading in Bahrein. I rejoined that my instructions were that we should always give European foreigners our good offices as a matter of courtesy, and that, if necessary, they should receive the same amount of protection as if they were British subjects, as bad Mr. Bahnson at the time of the attack on him. As regards the commercial claims of European foreigners, I expressed the opinion that in ordinary cases it would be in their interests to endeavour to get justice from the Sheikh direct in the first instance, and that if this course failed they could then ask the good offices of our Agent. Reference was then made to the majlis or permanent committee of respect able native merchants appointed for the settlement of commercial disputes, which is a feature of the administration of justice in Bahrein. Dr, Listemann’s idea seemed to be that the interests of European merchants might be prejudiced by being submitted to the arbitration of a purely native tribunal, I informed him that speaking from memory I believed that the majlis in such cases usually sat at the Agency, under the supervision of the Political Agent, and that ordinarily I thought that the finding of the majlis would be subject to his concurrence. On conclusion of the conversation, my colleague said that be had been asking for personal enlightenment as a new comer, and since then I have heard no more from him on the subject in question. 3 , The question of the formation and status of this majlis has recently been brought into some prominence in connection with the case of claims against the estate of one Seyyid Khalaf, deceased, with regard to which I have addressed the Government of India in my letter No. 75 of to-day s date. Search has been made in the Bushire records for any correspondence throwing li-ht on the origin of this tribunal, but nothing has u P&gt; to the present been found, nor does it appear that it was an arrangement introduced specially at the instance of the Residency, nor that the Resident has hitherto exercised any revisionary powers over it. The institution seems to have been developed automatically in the days of our Native Agents and to have, up till recently, fulfilled its purpose quietly and adequately. I attach a memorandum on the subject compiled from some incidental references to the subject in communi- eations received from our present Political Agent. 14, With reference to the position of Foreign European merchants in Bahrein, I learn from Captain Pride;&gt;ux that the four representatives of the German firm, of which Herr Wonckhaus is the principal, are still in the habit, when in conversation with him, of harping upon their claim to extra territoria lity in Bahrein both in regard to criminal and commercial matters. Captain Prideaux considers in fact that they would definitely refuse to go before the Sheikh’s tribunals, and that if we were to say that this with local merchants sitting on it, and the British representative supervising the finding, is a Territorial Court, they would perhaps object even to that. If, on the other hand, we say that the mnjlis is a Court which the Protecting Power in consultation with the Chief has evolved for the settlement of dis putes in which British subjects or Europeans claiming our good offices are concerned, it would seem to atford them an opening for asking us to define our position more precisely. For present purposes I asked the Chief informally at my interview on the 14th insiant 10 agree to that pending any further communication between us on the subject, findings come to by the majlis sitting at the Agency should he considered as subject to modification by the Political Agent in consulta tion with himself, Sheikh Esa, in the event of the European foreigner concern ed not being satisfied with the settlement made by the majlis. I trust that pending full consideration of the subject, the Government of India will approve Of this arrangement. 5. The present position being as described in the foregoing paragraphs, the Government of India will perhaps concur with me in thinking that the question of the administration of justice in Bahrein at the present time requires to be placed on a more precise footing, both in view of the gradual influx of Europeans into the island, and of the modified situation brought about by the appointment of a fully qualified gazetted officer of the superior status to represent our interests. 6 . In connection with the question of the judicial position of the latter, I beg to refer to the correspondence ending with Colonel Kemball’s letter No. 10-S.A., addressed to the Foreign Department on 2nd July 1902, on the subject of the appointment of the Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein to be a Notary Public, and would ask that the question of the issue of an Order in Council for Bahrein may again be taken into consideration. If it is thought necessary to give our representative Consular status for duties in connection with merchant shipping, then perhaps the terms of his appointment in that capacity might nominally refer only to Katr and Katif, and not to Bahrein. As regards Bahrein, it would seem most convenient that he should be appointed a Justice of Peace and endowed with the powers of a Subordinate Judge with appeal to the Resident in the Persian Gulf, or with those of a District Judge in direct subordination to the High Court of Bombay. As, however, tbe precise nature of the powers which it is necessary to give him and the manner in which it should be done, is inseparable from the larger question of our own relations in regard to Bahrein, it seems advisable for me at this stage merely to commend the subject to the wise consideration of the Government of India in conjunction with the other questions affecting Bahrein which I am now reporting upon. Memorandum regarding the Bahrein majlis or permanent Native Court of Arbitration, dated 26th February 1906. For the last 49 years or more it has been customary here, when commer cial disputes have arisen between British subjects or proteges on the one hand and Bahrein subjects or persons of any other nationality on the other, for the British Agent, first Native and subsequently English—to assemble a Court of Arbitration, locally called a mdilis formed from a body of respectable personswhose names are borne on a permanent list for the hearing and adjudication of the case. This practice at its origin received the assent of the Chief and the list includes a number of the most influential Sunni, Shiah, and Hindu Indian merchants of Bahrein. &lt; The Court has always had six permanent members and a few waiting members called in occasionally when any of the permanent members are sick or away from Bahrein. The six permanent members at present are— 2 Bahrein subjects (one Sunni and one Shiah). ; 2 Arabs of Nejd. 2 British Indian Hindus. When the services of the majUs are required it has not been the invariable custom to refer each time to the local authorities, as no person sits in the Court in a particular case whose presence is objected to by either party, and although a munshi of the Chief’s does sometimes attend at the request of one party or the other for the purpose of watching the proceedings, such is not always or necessarily the case. No doubt, however, if a witness refused to attend, it would be necessary to invoke the Sheikh’s assistance, but in practice this difficulty has never occurred. The services of this mnjlis are frequently invoked for the settlement of disputes between British subjects and between parties of different^ nation alities, and then it assembles at the Agency unless given special permission for purposes of convenience to assemble elsewhere. The Sheikh also refers to it occasionally cases between Bahrein subjects which he finds it inconvenient or difficult to settle off-hand himself. The reputation of the majih locally is exceedingly high, and it does not appear that the Residency has ever interfered with or quashed its decisions which are usually in the nature of a compromise. During the last year only one case has come under the Political Agent’s notice in which the settlement of the majlis was not accepted without demur. In that instance the Political Agent re-assembled the Court, as the objector alleged that the whole of his evidence had not been exammed, and finding the objection frivolous confirmed the Court’s decision. The position of the Political Agent towards the Court hitnerto seems to be more analogous to that of a Judge Advocate than a Court of Appeal. Where none of the g litigants were British subjects or entitled to British protection he has really no locus standi, but yet under the peculiar circumstances of the case principles may often be involved which affect the interests of the whole community. . , . , . The litigants themselves have no right to nominate the members ot the Court in their particular suit, but the interests of both parties are carefully considered in this regard, and the members selected either by the Chief or the Political A 'ent or by both in consultation according to the varying ciroum- stances of the case.

O4 2. A copy of the Political Agent’s original report is enclosed. It treats of two distinct cases, with regard to the Bahrein, No. 46, dated 26th January 1906. 0 f w hich a separate reference was made to the Government of India by telegraph on 19ih February. At the time I received Captain Prideaux’s communication I was expecting to visit Bahrein a few days later and. preferred to discuss the cases further with him before taking specific action on his report. 3 . Under the older order of things the disposal of neither case would have presented much practical difficulty, but the critical vigilance of foreigners and agents of foreign representatives at the present time makes it advisable for us to shape our procedure as far as possible on lines which will pass hostile criticism should any be offered, and I therefore treated the present cases with some caution. Several possible solutions were discussed between the Political Agent and myself, but everyone carried with it some objection either local or legal, and I came to the conclusion that it would be best to refer both cases to higher authority on the broader issues involved and on receipt of instructions to carry them out as far as the local conditions admitted. I am now desired to submit a fuller report with my own views in respect of the case in which a Persian subject is concerned. 4. Primarily three alternative courses seem to admit of consideration (t) That the Political Agent should ‘place the results of his preliminary enquiry before Sheikh JEsa and let him punish the man. From the correspondence leading up to the Ultimatum which was presented to Sheikh Esa last year in connection with the attack on Mr. Bahnson and on the Persian community, respectively, I gather that we have not definitely withdrawn the Persians in Bahrein from the Sheikh’s jurisdiction in ordinary matters, but have contented ourselves with asserting our right to interfere when necessary to save them or any other persons not subjects of the Sheikh from oppression. If this be the correct view, there would be no primary objection to course (1). On the other hand, there are attendant difficulties which Captain Prideaux mentions in paragraph 6 of his letter, and it is, moreover, probable that if the Persian were handed over to Sheikh Esa without any definite pronouncement of our decision in regard to the exercise of jurisdiction over Persians generally, the remainder of the Persian community would take alarm at this course and report the matter to their Government. (it) The Persian might be forwarded to the Bushire Presidency icith a statement of the case and might be handed over to the local Persian authorities at Bushire for disposal. The Political Agent is averse to this course if it can be avoided for the reasons stated by him. Apart from the latter the procedure has to be considered in its bearing upon the discussion which is now progressing between the representatives of the British and Persian Governments in Tehran or London, and it seems chiefly a question for the consideration of His Majesty’s Government as to whether this course would inconvenience them in anyway. It would in any case be an indirect pronouncement to the effect that Persians were withwrawn altogether from the jurisdiction of the Sheikh of Bahrein, and also were not justiceable in criminal matters by the British representative; and such a ruling would embrace the case of all foreigners in Bahrein.(«it) The Political Agent might ask the prisoner if he consents to submit to his jurisdiction ) and if he does he might be forthwith sentenced and punished under the Political Agent's supervision. The objection to this is that the mere asking of the question would put the idea into the man’s head that there was some doubt as to our right to deal with him, and if he were subsequently aggrieved by the sentence inflicted on him, it would probably occur to him or some of his relations to complain to Bushire. Moreover, the local authorities here have agents in Bahrein who report everything to them which passes. There are hardly sufficient grounds for treating him as a British employe. B Of the three courses above suggested the last commends itself to me nost but on the whole I am inclined to advise that the man be detained by he Political Agent for some little time longer under present conditions, and be hen expelled from Bahrein territory conjointly by the Political Agent and the Sheikh P in consultation. His previous history would certainly deter him from liawin'’ attention to himself in Persia. I admit that this would not he an entirely satisfactory solution from a Bahrein point of view as the man might be „ na idered to have got off too easily, but the adoption of this alternative Zsesses none of tlnf potential disadvantages attaching to the previous ones md before another similar case were likely to arise Government u on t time to give deliberate consideration to the question of the future treatment of Persians and Poreigners in Bahrein and the judicial powers with which it is advisable to equip our Agent. -n 6 In considering the cases under report I have studied Hall s Foreign Jurisdiction of the British Crown, to which I would invite reference, but have noSund fnft aching very helpful to a ^ision in regard to ^he Present tha/they are at Sent atfl hav aDd the Government of India on this subject in a recent ^communication, No. 76 of 25th February 1906. No. 46, dated Bahrein, the 26th January 1906. From—C aptain F. B. Pridraux, Political Agent, Bahrein, T 0 xhe Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. . I have the honour to inform you that there are now under detention m ZSStZSS&amp;l* ft. letter for me to issue the judgments and sentences. 3. Before doing this, however, I think ‘^ ' 'L^Tn^c^ criminal cases mit the following observations on the geneml posit a t tentlon to the r , . *. 1. ft. «»?. ft»'8 h ft* *' J the owner is a British subject, t ie crew are ^ Baluchis in nationality, presumably therefore subjects ot Maska t J ff was fi rs t brought to my The consignee is a Bahrein subject, and^ me t0 J eal wi th cognizance by the Chief of Bahrein, n e( ^ a term of more than six it. I do not propose to sentence the accused ^ ^ de for tke enforce . months’ imprisonment, and as arratgem n T d tive labour in ThLi ^nC^t So^^ions of any special intricacy affect this case. 5o.' In the other case the circumstances are more serious. The offender is a Persian, who is proved to possess a very bad character, but who has apparently been allowed employment on board the British Indian Steam Navigation Company s steamers on account of his influence over the class from which the coolies are drawn, this influence being due to his reputation for cruelty and general wickedness during a period of service as Ferrash-bashi and executioner under the Deputy Governor of Bingah. f +i In a J!. endeaYOUr to involve in his own misfortune the permanent servant or the Steamer Company, whose office was immediately to supervise him this individual has confessed to having committed not only the offence of which he is accused, but also of having habitually pilfered cargo. At the same time be has most successfully concealed the lis. 300 now stolen. I am of opinion that this man s punishment cannot he adequately fixed at less than two years’ rigo rous imprisonment. He is said to be practically impervious to the effeefof hoggings and hot-iron firings which punishments he was made acquainted with in his own person before he fled from Persia, so that if his present offence had been committed in that country, there is not much doubt that he would now be condemned, by any hut a friendly judge, to suffer the loss of his right hand. 6. The Government of Bahrein have no arrangements for keeping convicts m durance for any but Die shortest periods. In this particular case, too, the Sheikh would doubtless object, if he were asked to feed and imprison a foreigner who had committed a crime on board a vessel in his waters certainly 3 but claiming extra-territoriality against him. H ere the offence sufficiently unimportant as to merit only a few months’ imprisonment, the difficulty could perhaps be evaded by the constitution of a Court, composed ofmyselfanda representative of the Chief, as is customarily IT 5 ! T aC i CU m d 18 a ? a ! irein sub i ect or a foreigner who prefers not to invoke British good offices, and the other party is a British or foreign subject • e vf 01 d ° es seem desirable that the trial of the accused should he informally completed by me and that he should then be made over to the Persian authorities to undergo such sentence as they may be capriciously pleased to enforce upon him. It is possible that in such circumstances he s on e r a no more worse punishment than imprisonment until the Maho- medan New Year’s day, but, on the other hand, as a refugee from Persia, and more particularly if he is a fugitive from the jurisdiction of the present Governor of the Gulf Ports, his treatment might be worse than the Government ot India would care to contemplate. 8 . It seems to me that such a case as this may occur again. Moreover there are a number of foreigners, such as Native Christians, in the islands in regard to whom a sentence of a long term of imprisonment here or even the trial of a capital charge would be impossible. 9. Under Foreign Department Notification No. 468-E.A.. dated the 22nd ^1901, communicated to my predecessor under your office endorsement No. 3/9, dated the 20 th April 1901, the Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein was granted the powers of a Magistrate of the 1 st Class in respect of offences committed by Native Indian subjects of His Majesty. Tins seems to be the only enactment dealing with this subiect affecfin&lt;- Bahrein, as the “ Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council, 1889,” so far as I understand, applies only to “ that portion of the coasts and islands of the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman which is within the dominions of His Majesty the Shah of Persia.” No Sessions Court nor higher Appellate Court have been yet indicated, nor have I any instructions as to whether in serious cases I am permitted to^ commit convicts to a jail in British India. I submit that the time is now ripe for a decision on all these points, and further I would heo* to be granted the powers of a Justice of the Peace, as is almost invariably done I believe, in India in the case of European 1 st Class Magistrates. 610. In conclusion, I would be elad to receive instructions on the subject of dieting under-trial prisoners and short-term convicts, as also of any other expenses that may unavoidably be incurred in relation to such P er s 01 js. During the past twelve months I have submitted no bills on account or e dieting of either prisoners or refugee-slaves, as I have always been able to employ such people on the construction of Government buildings, and will still babble to do l for a little time longer. This method of meeting the difficn y will however eventually cease, and it would then appear necessary that I should be authorised to draw from some special allotment ot my annual Budget Grant. 1. C.
