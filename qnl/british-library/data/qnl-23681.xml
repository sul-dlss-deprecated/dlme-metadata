If Parliament shall not approve such ordinances, the Government shall notify the termina tion of their operation, and they shall be deemed to be repealed as from the date of such notification. Such ordinances shall be signed by all Ministers. *Note: —The Arabic is careless and leaves it to be assumed that ordinances may be presented to Parliament at any time during the ' first ' i.e., the next. Session. The intention was that they should be dealt with at the beginning of the Session. The word 44 law ' shall include ordinances passed by virtue of the provisions of this Article, unless anything in its * text otherwise implies. *Note: —The expression ' its text ' is obscure. The word ' its ' cannot, in the Arabic, apply to anything in the paragraph. The words ' throughout this Constitution ' originally inserted, have been omitted from the beginning of the paragraph. Their reinstatement would clear up the obscurity, both in meaning and grammar, of the paragraph.

(2) That the words emphasize ' other,' i .e., ' any other offence whatsoever.' (3) That they indicate imprisonmnent of any duration, as distinguished from the minimum imprisonment mentioned earlier. This third interpretation is undoubtedly the intended meaning. (8) Who has a material interest direct or indirect arising from a contract with any of the public departments of 'Iraq, unless such interest arises from his being a shareholder in a company composed of more than twenty-five persons. Farmer® of tithes and tenants of Government lands and other Government properties shall be excepted from this; (9) Who is a lunatic or an idiot; (10) Who is related to the King in such degree as shall be prescribed by special law In any case membership of 'ooth Chambers shall not be held together by one person.

In its original form Article 39 was in three paragraphs in the Arabic and four in the English. Article 5 of the Amendment Law of 1925 says ' Article 39 shall be amended in the following manner,' then followed a redraft of the provisions of the first paragraph of the original Arabic (corresponding to the first two paragraphs of the original English translation of the Article). There is little legal ground for retaining the remaining two original Arabic and English paragraphs since the amending law makes no reference to the reten tion of any part of the original Article. Logically there is however good reason to believe that it waa intended ^hat the remainder of the Article should lie retained in its original form. The matter may later be so decided on reference to the High Court. The translation of these two paragraphs is as follows : — The Chamber may adjourn its meeting from time to time according to tbe internal rules of the Chamber.

HouBtoiin-iioswall^ despatch Ho. 453 of the 17th September 9 1938, I have the honour to forward f to you herewith a translation of Law lio. 40 of 1942 amending the Iraci Stamp Law Ho. 5o of 1902 f which came into force on its publication in the Official Oaaette on the aist May,1942. 2. By Law ^o..42 of 1941# the fee charged in respect of residence hooks was raised from 250 fils to 750 fils, this fee to be levied on first application and on subsequent yearly renewals. The feo was subsequently raised to I.L.l/OQO with effect froia the 5rd Loreuber, 1941.? rhese increases caused considerable hardship to the poorer sections of the Indian community resident in this country andt as a result of the latter^ protests, I represented to the iiinister for Foreign Affairs that the fee seemed unjustifiably high, at the same time pointing out that no such fees were leried 'by the Government of India on Iraqi subject* resitiant in that country. The 1941 Law has accordingly been amended and, since the principle of reciprocity is admitted In Article 5 of the new Law, I have requested the Iraqi Government to instruct the authorities concerned to issue residence books to British Indian subjects in future free of stamp duty. 3. I am not aware what fees are levied cm foreigners resident in the United Kingdom at the present time, but I understand that in 1938 an initial foe of one shilling was charged and that no subsequent charges were made. If it is still the case, it oight be possible to induce the Iraqi Government to agree to levy a fee of only 5C fils on British subjects of United i^ngdom origin resident in Iraq, but I am not clear whether Article 3 of the new Law can be so interpreted. The British adviser to the ] inistry of Finance considers that the act of levying a fee in the United ^dngdom, irrespective of the amount involved, would justify the Iraqi Government in levying their own fee as laid down in the Law. He believes, however, that if the fee is only levied once in the United -i.ngdom, the Xraq^. authorities might agree to similur procedure in Iraq. 4. subject to the above consideratioiB, I should be glad to learn whether you wish ue to raise this question with the Iraqi Government in respect of British subjects of United -ingdom origin, nationals of ialestine, ifansjordan, Koweit, Bahrein and the Crucial coast, and other British protected persons. If you wish ue to do so, I should be grateful for details of what foeo (if any) are levied on foreigners resident in the countries concerned. 5.
