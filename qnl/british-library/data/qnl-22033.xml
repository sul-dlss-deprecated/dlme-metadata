Nor could we permit the unrestricted export of alcholic liquors, and I am doubtful of the Bahrain merchants ability to keep the internal rnarkdt stocked with British textiles for sale as controlled prices (Schedule lll(i) ) if exports were not restricted The building programmes of the B.O.a.C., Cable and Wireless and other firms, as well as that of the Bahrain Government, would be affected by a rise in the cost of building materials. Such a rise would also affect the rents of new residential accommodation, v/hich in turn . would necessitate higher wages. I myself doubt the Bahrain merchants ability to bring down and keep down prices of building materials./ Some of these arguments against a further relaxation of price control were stated in S.30 when the last relaxation was made. v 72. 73. / 74.

It will be recalled that this high profit was given as an inducement to import during difficult times. and fabulous prices are being obtained, for example, a watch invoiced at 7C Swiss Francs,is sold locally for Rs 275/325 . Admittedly this is a luxury type of article but surely 100^ profit would be sufficient. I shall be glad to have your views on the above suggestions. A fair margin of profit now would be 25% Swiss Watches.

I suggest that as a start the following goods might be de-.controlled if you approve Cigarettes. Toilet goods. Medicines. S. The bazaar is at present overstocked with cigarettes and large quantities are shortly expected. Cigarettes are being sold at present at less than the controlled price. 3. There are large supplies of toilet goods in the shops and further imports are expected, the same remark applies to medicines which have in recent months fallen very considerably in price. 4. Later, when more goods are imported, I would like to suggest that price controls should be relaxed on such goods as wireless sets, fountain pens, watches and other articles which cannot be regarded as neces sities .

Considering that our Company at Bahrain is actually the Company itself and that our Agent there disposes of the goods for account of the Company and not paid for by him, the Singer Factory when she invoices the goods, she actually does so at the rxxs exact cost price, allowing the selling organisation i to do the biggest margin of profit. ’Whereas in the case of ’ other commodities, the manufacturer certainly takes his own profit and which he adds on the amount of the Invoice. 5o. We presume that importers or wholesalers are allowed a cer tain amount of profit on the goods they import, and as in the case of other commodity, the wholesalers sell to retailers, so that these latter also must have a certain amount of profit, and considering that we ourselves are both importers and re tailers, we should be allowed double profit* 60 * During all these war years, we have been maintaining our shop and warehouse at Bahrain and incurring all these expenses with the hope that one day when war will be over and when things return to normal, we* would at least make up for the losses we have incurred during all these pasu years* 7o* Although we realise that we are not in any way allowed to make certain suggestions, we humbly beg to point out that our kind of goods are not a necessity and that Itheir acquisition by the clients is not someftLng that must be ha© 1 # by them and could be considered more of a luxury than a necessity.

Sir, Bah- i fro/Z' 8 September 1946, Application for increase in profit re cords and radio gins I have the honour to^confirm verbal discussion with the Assistant Political Agent #1 4th September last re above, and now set down my request in writing In the sale of ^amophone records we are up against a definite hinderence Jftecause our distributors will not comit themselves in their purchases as iuch as the business requires, due to their fear tltt they will be left with UNSALEABLE RECORDS, with which nothing J^n be done, and which represent to the distributors a dead losj In th e normal way other territories where no control of psi^HHArgins is enforced, the profits are generally 50% on cost to^^^Ho.stributor ( 33 1/3$ on their sale price) and from 20 - Z^mr5% to the dernier who sells in the shops. Some times as in Bahrain of course the distributor is also the dealer to large measure but not entirely. He has to distribute to other people who have shops, in order to secure a worthwhile turnover. We want to do some native recording - here the risk of dead stock is even greater, since nobody has yet succeed ed in accurately judging native popular taste. There will be successes and failures. If a profit margin* is sufficiently', large, then it cqn look after the failures and dead M*Jbk - at least in pact. With radio, dead stock does not arise, but turnover is testricted because there is insufficient margin for two dealers. Thus the importer has to sell to the public. This restricts sales, as obviously he cannot tap as large a field as if he had several s ub-dis tributor s. I apply,therefore, for margins to be increased on our products, i.e. gramophone records, gramophones, needles.Telephone Number: 2458 Southall Telegraphic Addreas : *‘E M U” Hayes, Middlesex. ELECTRIC &amp; MUSICAL INDUSTRIES LIMITED 2 BLYTH HOAD, HAYES, MIDDLESEX. ra v i 2i household appliances to a figure which will permit of sub-distributorships being arranged and sales inc reased. Radio spare parts are in the same category as records# They have to be held for servicing radio, may never be used, and represent dead loss to the buyer. His profit margin of 20$ is insufficient to carry probable losses. He doesn4t order, and ser vicing of radio suffers. If therefore for records, radio spares, the margin can be increased to say 400. on sale price, the buyers would have more encouragement to stock up. Other products require less margin and 53 1/3# would meet the bill I think. The writer will be back at Hayes towards middle of December next, but would esteem it a great favour if the result of this application be transmitted to the company direct.

After a very lengthy discussion, it was obvious that the unanimous opinion of all merchants was the removal of controls on all commodities, with the exception of sugar, wheat, Piece- goods from India, and articles for which foreign exchange had been obtained through “!.B.

DIRECTOR OF CUSTOMS AND PORT OFFICER, BAHRAIN. c.c. The Adviser, the G vernment of Bahraincg&gt; No.C/991. rhe Acting Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, B a h r a i n. MEMORANDUM. Reference your Memorandum No.PA/FC/ll dated the 17th September, 1947. 2. Fhe increase in wages to be made by the Bahrain Government - vide your memorandum No.2234-22, dated the 20th September, 1947 - which will also have to be made by the Residency, the Agency, and other employers in Banrain, will add considerably to the present excessive purchasing power whicn is already chasing inadequate supplies of consumer goods; and, In spite of controls, will contribute directly and indirectly (through black- marxet operations) to the inflationary spiral in Bahrain. 3. While, therefore, I am in general sympathy with the desire of the merchant community for freedom from controls, I cannot ignore the increase in the cost of living of labourers, artizans, and clerks which would occur if there were a sharp^rise in the prices of essential and semi-essential commodities in Bahrain. Fo permit such a rise by the removal of price and export controls would discount the Increases in wages now being made, and would adversely affect the present favourable ratio between wages and the cost of living, upon which the Bahrain Government and the companies here should depend to retain their labour forces. 4. Fhe merchants’ argument that the removal of controls would induce them to import goods more freely and in larger quantities, and would reduce prices through the effects of competition, is one that can be supported by some examples, but many instances could be adduced to show that removal of controls has elsewhere resulted in sharp rises in prices; because, however strong the merchants’ desire freely to import large quantities of goods,many of the goods required here are just not available for export in sufficient quanti ties. For instance; there are a number of firms importing British textiles into Bahrain and none can get more than occasional token shipments of goods. It has been argued that those goods - and many other serai-luxuries - are in a price range beyond the pockets of labourers and artizans; but it is also true that, if the prices of these goods were to rise beyond the reach of the people who ordinarily buy them now, the oressure on supplies of the cheaper lines would be increased*at the expense of the labourers and artizans. The prices of essentials, semi-luxuries and luxuries are, in fact, interdependent. schedules of the current Order relaxing price controls on a 5. I have therefore carefully gone through the details of the Bahrain Government’s proposal and have amended the /largelarge range of goods while retaining export controls and price controls on commodities which are essential to those in the lower income groups, and which are still in short supply. objections: and I have not gone further because I consider that the need to maintain stable prices &gt; for essential consumer goods outweighs the desirability of meeting in full the merchants' demand for freer trading. 7. A copy of Order No. 8 dated the 2nd of'October, 1947, modifying the previous Order is enclosed. 6. These changes meet most of the merchants' Political Agent, Bahrain.ORDER No. 8 OF 1947.

(g) Minutes of a Meeting of the Food Control Committee held at the Adviserate or Wednesday, February 4th, 1948, at 10 A.I with 11.3.Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa al Khalifah, C.I.E., in the chair. The following members were also present: Mr.C.Dalrymple Belgrave, C.B.E., Adviser to the Government. Mr.G.’ .R.Smith, M.B.E., Food Controller. Shaikh Ebrahim. bin Mohamad al Khalifah.

Mr. Ibrahim al Khalfcfan. The Food Controller informed the meeting that according to existing regulations, the controlled selling price of meat was Beef fd 2.8.C, per ruba of 4 lbs. Goat I-eat Ps 2.12.0 per ruba, and Mutton Rs 3/- per ruba, that imports of live stock were few and far between at present, and that from investigations he had made, it was not possible to obtain meat at the controlled prices. As to^reason for the present shortage of meat- this was partly due to low valuation of imports of live stock, and the very snail profit now being made on barter tea and sugar. The Food Controller therefore proposed that the controlled selling price of meat be raised by one rupee, ie Beef Rs 3.8.0, per ruba. Goat meat Rs 3.12.0 and Mutton Rs 4/- per ruba, and that the valuation Committee likewise increase their valuation of im ports for barter purposes. To this proposal the Committee fegreed unanimously and a notice was issued to the public informing them of the increased controlled prices / *~ of meat. The next item discussed was that of Busrah dates. To encourage the large scale import of this commodity it was As . decided to increase the barter rate from 40$ to 50$, le up as follows, 25;j Tea and 25/5 Sugar, The meeting then closed r i ■ iHis Britannic Majesty 1 s Pol&gt;4i&lt;fal Agent, Manama, Bahrein Island, Persian Gulf. Sir, Manama, Bahrein Island April 26th, 1948 I received a consignment of Alarm Clocks last week which was cleared thru Customs and brought in the shop. The Customs Department issued a notification to sell these clocks on April 25 th. The shop as usual was opened at 9«G0 A.M. and clocks put on sale. Hundreds of people including local Police men in uniforms and private dresses along with other ordinary and street beggars crowded and rushed in. In about half an hour the same people who got the clocks came back again for it and the mob was so much that it could not be controlled. They broke the shop doors and got into it, broke the show cases. Afterwards with the help of some of my friends I got the men out and brought the carpenter and got the doors fixed. Again at about 3.30 P.M. I opened the shop the same crowd was waiting outside and as soon as I got into the shop they rushed in and most of them jumped inside and grabbed the clocks and started running out with out payment. My shop boy locked us all inside and went to bring some official Police help and with their help I got the shop closed at about 4.30 P.M. I have been robbed of so many clocks and quite a few articles are missing from my shop. This morning I went to Mr. Purshotam, Chief Clerk of Customs who stated that Mr. Smith, Director of Customs, will assist me in getting 3 Police men only. I have asked the Customs people to issue the chit for the remaining clocks but they refuse to do so, and I refuse to put the clocks on sale in such a manner. I therefore approach your honour to help me by instructing the Director of Customs to issue chits on me for the balance. I cannot open the shop in presence of this furious mob. Let me tell you Sir that the Police people themselves are trying to create trouble and sending the people two or three times to get these clocks. Your immediate help will be greatly appreciated by me. Yours obediently, c-, S. MUUESWo. -29/33 Political Agency, Eahrain. The 27th Auril, 1948. To The Director of Customs, Eah rain. MEM0RA3DUM. This is to confirm the arrangement made verbally yesterday that chits may be issued by you to the public for the purchase of alarm clocks from Mr. G. Mulji. 6W (fyp for Political Agent, Bahrain.. No. / 5 3O- 1367 Office of the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain Dated, 19th Rajab, 1367 •May 26, 1948. H. B. M* s Political Agent, Bahrain. Memorandum: - There has developed in the bazaar a general tendency to assume that when price controls were removed profiteering became legal. The Price and Export Control Order No. 2 of 1947 states in article 6 'In addition to the provisions of this Order dealing with certain specified commodities, any merchant selling goods of-ajiy kind to the public at prices Whici, in the opinion of the Political Agent;-are excessive will render him self liable to the penalties provided in Article 13 of this Order.' If this Order is still in force, and it has not, I think, been cancelled, I would like to suggest that the Article quoted above should be re-issued. \ Adviser to the G-overnment.^mSSamBSm 11 ' © (L 'b-t i aM~-&lt;i&lt;~. /^) Ref,S.^ Spoken to Food Controller. References should be flagged. Please put up with file. a© V 2.V (Itld.) H.D.H.R. 10/4 Placed below is the War Regulations file. Order No.2 is at pages 90-95 (flagged). Schedule 4 stating the percentages of profit to be charged is at page 94. There were tw r o reasons for granting such high profits to the merchants (i) to encourage import during difficult times, as already stated by the Food Controller, (ii) to reduce the amount of goods being smuggled out of ^ahrain. The first consideration is now without point as trade is brisker and goods are arriving in large quantities and at frequent intervals. The second could not be prevented in any case. I Excluding the 6th and last items in Schedule IV and item later added(Order No.4 of 1946) p.97 namely: Electric batteries of 6 or more volts Motor accessories (imported from the U.K.and U.S.A.) and Motor vehicles (imported from the b.K., U.S.A., and India) I think that the profit on all other goods classified in the schedule should be reduced to 25^. The E 00( 5 Controller has in mind only the items listed from toilet goods to tinned provisions. I Ltiye placed below a cutting taken from the 'Morning Standard' of Bombay. Some form of Paragteaph 1 of the order could ^ very profitably be applied to Bahrain in the interests of the consumer. The invoiced prices of many goods are much too high (e.g. that of woollen goods). ' Regarding the Swiss v/atches the suggested profit geff of lOOf is sti. -1 ! too high. There are a very large number of watches in the bazaar and very shortly with the release of Sv/iss francs there,will be very many more. Not to control this item in the past was due to the decision of the Merchants Advisory Committee Meeting of the 11th June, 1945.
