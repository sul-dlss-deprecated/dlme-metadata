                  <summary>Recto: work on calendar reckoning mentioning the maḥzorim, the moladot
                     and the different kinds of Hebrew year; names of the months of the year and the
                     numbers of their days in Ladino are written vertically on the leaf. There are
                     also a few draft lines of some phrases contained in the petition that appears
                     on verso, and a list of figures in the marginalia, as well as an endorsement of
                     the petition that appears on verso. Verso: petition to Saladin from ʿAbd
                     al-Bāqī b. Yaḥyā, the Jew, a resident of Malīj, in the province of al-Ḡarbiyya,
                     in the Delta. Ca. 564-589 AH (= 1169-1193 CE). ʿAbd al-Bāqī b. Yaḥyā complains
                     about the tax collectors, who forced him to leave his family and job and to
                     work for them, and asks for the production of a rescript that would allow him
                     to go back to his town and family. Arabic on recto: answer to the petition
                     maintaining that since ʿAbd al-Bāqī b. Yaḥyā had some experience as a tax
                     collector, he could not avoid this service.</summary>

            <p>Nāṣiḥ al-Dīn Isḥāq. The slave ʿAbd l-Bāqī b. Yaḥyā, the Jew, who resides in Malīj. In the name of God, the merciful and compassionate. May God, the exalted, make eternal the rule of the exalted and lofty seat, the mighty lord, al-Mālik al-Nāṣir, the uniter of the word of the faith, the conqueror of the slaves of the cross, Ṣalāḥ al-Dunyā wa-l-Dīn, sultan of Islam and the Muslims, reviver of the dynasty of the commander of the faithful, cause his power to endure and exalt his word. The slave kisses the ground and reports that he is a poor man with a family and children, who makes his living among Muslims in Malīj in the province of al-Ḡarbiyya. He pays the poll tax for which he is liable and there is no one with whom he has bad relations. Recently he has been hurt and made to suffer by the poll-tax officials. They have summarily made him give up his employment and forced him to work as a tax collector and an informant. There has been no precedent for this for 60 years. The justice of the master should prevent his being caused damage and his being made to give up his livelihood. He asks for the issuing of an exalted rescript, may God increase its efficacy, to all the officials concerned with the collection of the poll tax in the province of al-Ḡarbiyya to release him so that nothing will befall him and to treat his case with justice and impartiality, that he may be able to live in his native town with his family and children. Let the exalted rescript be deposited in his hand, as a kindness and benefaction to him. Praise be to God alone and his blessings be upon our lord Muḥammad, his prophet, and save him.</p>

            <p>If there has been a precedent for you to work as a tax collector, you have no excuse with regard to the service of the aforementioned people.</p>
