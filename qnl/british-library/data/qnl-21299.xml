The history of the country now known as Persia, dates back continuously for over 2,500 years; and from the time of Cyrus tne Great, 550 B.C. to the death of Nadir Shah 1747 A.D., the succession of mighty dynasties which rose and fell dominated, or strongly influenced, the whole of the then civil ized world. With regard to history previous to 700 B.C. there is a good deal of information available, but dates seem rather vamie and numbers of legends and traditions are mixed up with i Hm J ever ’ certairi men ’ wIl ° ^ved during this period are still s i famous as to require mention. There were a rude ignorant people, inhabiting the mod ern province of Azarbaijan, who were reclaimed from barbar ism and taught to Hve in villages by Kaiomurs surnamed Paishdad or the Just Judge”. He founded the Paishdadian Dynasty. His successors extended their dominions till thev reached the Persian Gulf, and ruled practically over what is the present kingdom of Persia. Jamshid was a famous king of this dynasty. He found ed the celebrated city of Takht-i-Jamshid, better known as Persepohs, 35 miles north of Shiraz. His dominions were con- quered by a barbarian (possibly Assyrian) from the west nam ed Zohak. Jamshid fled to Sistan where he married the Princess of that country, and became thus the ancestor in the 6th generation of Rustam, the popular hero of Persia The cruelty and oppression of Zohak became unbearable’ A blacksmith named Kaf, whose sons had been murdered sue’ ceeded in raising an army, defeated and captured Zohak aiid restored the Paishdadian dynasty. Kaf’s leathern apron en larged with silk and gold embroideries, till it was 22 feet long and 15 feet broad, and studded with jewels of inestimable value, became the national standard of Persia for over i'oOO years, till it was captured by the Arabs at the battle of’ El Kadisiya, A ’2 Ancient B istory. B. C. 700. 607. 550. Medo- This dynasty continued till overthrown by the invaders from Turan. At the same time Slstan was ruled by the famous Kaianian Dynasty founded by Jamshid (see above) to which family in the seventh generation belonged Rustam, whose conquests and marvellous feats of heroism are the theme of countless Persian legends. This dynasty flourished in Sistan till ended by Alexander the Great. In the beginning of the 7th century B.C., the situation was as follows: To the west, Assyria and Babylon were still powerful. East of Assyria, and stretching to the Caspian Sea, was Manda, the ancient kingdom of Ellipi, on which the Scythians or Manda had lately descended and organised a state sufficient ly powerful to be a menace to Assyria. The capital was Ec- batana, (the modern Hamadan), and the country best known as the Median or Scythian Empire. South of this were Parsua or Persis (the modern Ears) an insignificant country with Elam of more importance to its south-west, bordering on Babylonia. Elam’s chief town was Shushan and it was ruled by the Princes of the early Archsemenians and the Elamite Dynas ty, (730-521 B.C.) in vassalage to Assyria, but practically independent, whenever a weak monarch ascended the Mnevite throne. Deioces was elected first king of the Scythians or Medes, a just, strong ruler, vho consolidated the Empire. Nineveh fell to the Scythians, vho took possession of Assyria to the Babylonian frontier, Cyrus the Great, son of Cambyses I, succeeded to the thrones of Elam and Persis, as a vassal of IshtuvegU the Scythian king of Manda. Cyrus, after war with his suzerain Ishtuvegu, took him Persian Empire, p r j gonerj annexed Ecbatana, ended the Median and Scythian Empire, and commenced the rule of the Medes and Persians. This began his career of conquest, which continued till the whole of Asia Minor was in- his hands, and divided into satra pies with strong governments. He encouraged the Jews to rebuild their temple. Cambyses II succeeded Cyrus, killed in battle. He treated the Jews with rigour, 52‘JInvasion of Egypt—Battle of Pelusium—Egypt a Persian b. o. Province.

The Persians were accustomed to get ships and sailors to form their navies, from the Phoenicians, who on this account were highly favoured vassals. During the reign of Artaxerxes II, his younger brother 401 Cyrus raised an army and attempted to secure the throne for himself. He was defeated and killed at the battle of Cunaxa north of Babylon. His mercenaries, 10,000 Greeks under Xenophon, succeeded in retreating over the Armenian high lands,.in the depth of winter. Alliance of Persia and Athens against Sparta. Persian fleet defeated Spartans at Cuidus. 394 . The Satraps of Asia Minor broke out into revolt, thereby 370-385, greatly weakening the Persian Empire. The Egyptian army had also lately teen reorganized by Chabrias the Athenian. Artaxerxes III. Persians defeated in Egypt, but reconquered 358. * the country 18 years later.4 B.C. 336. 334, 332. Macedonian Empire. A Macedonian army under Phillip of Macedon crossed into Asia. Operations arrested by the death of Phillip, Darius III now became king of Persia. Alexander the Great crossed the Hellespont with about 30.000 infantry and 4,000 cavalry, and won the tattle of Grani- cus annihilating 20,000 Persians with practically no loss to him self, Darius foolishly abandoned any operations by sea, thereby leaving Alexander’s lines of communications free. He collected 600.000 troops, an unwieldy ill-disciplined mass, regarded with contempt the small highly trained army of his enemy, and allowed him to pass the defiles of the Taurus quite unmolested, though the passage was most difficult for the invaders. Alexander then won the battles of Issus and Amanus. Alexander captured and destroyed Tyre. Tyre was the headquarters of the Phoenician fleet, and it would appear that the reason for its destruction was the fear that Darius would perceive his original strategical error, and strike with the fleet at the enemy’s lines of communication. As the result of these victories Alexander secured most of Asia Minor and Egypt joined him. Alexander invaded Assyria, crossing the Tigris unopposed below Nineveh, though a small determined enemy might have destroyed his whole army here. He met and defeated Darius at Arbela or Gangemela, some marches south-east of Nineveh, Darius selected an open plain for the battle, attributing his former defeats to the fact that the ground in previous battles had been too closed in to enable him to use his overwhelming numbers to full advantage. The Archsemenian Dynasty was thus overthrown. Baby lon, Susa, Pasagardce, and Persepolis fell. Darius fled to Medea where he was afterwards murdered. Alexander proclaimed himself king of all Asia. The Persians thus maintained first place among the nations for just two centuries, or, from the time of Cyrus the Great until the Asiatic conquests of Alexander. Their Empire was the greatest the world had yet seen, extending from India on the east, to the extreme confines of Asia on the west and north-west and beyond to Egypt. It even threatened by the subjugation of Greece to invade Europe,Persepolis wag burned, The popular version being that it was set on fire, during one of the drunken orgies, in which Alexander was accustomed to indulge in company with his generals. Alexander overran with his cavalry, in the midst 330. of the rigours of winter, whole region of Farsistan, subduing the semi-independent mountain tribes. He marched over parts of Afghanistan to Kabul, and crossed 329. the Hindu Kush and the Oxus. Regions between the Hindu Kush and right bank of the 327. Indus were conquered. He crossed the Indus near Attock. Indian Prince Porus 326. defeated at the Jhelum. Chenab crossed in full flood. Ravee crossed, Indians again defeated here, with loss of some 17,000 killed and 70,000 prisoners. On approaching the Sutlej, Alexander’s soldiers refused to advance further, so he returned to the Jhelum and proceeded down it in boats to the Indus, thence to the Indian Ocean. The ships were sent along the coast to the mouth of the Tigris. The army marched by land along the coast to Gwadar, thence in land via Bampur, Saidabad, north of Shiraz, and crossed Karun river at Ahwaz. They suffered more from thirst and sickness in this march, than in all their former marches and battles. Susa reached early in the year. Levies of 30,000 Persian 325. youths raised, these were armed and disciplined like Macedo nians. Alexander now endeavoured with some success to induce all his soldiers to marry women of the country. Alexander died at Babylon, aged 33, while preparing for a 323. campaign against Arabia. Terrible civil wars at once broke out, lasting 42 years followed by the gradual dismemberment of the Empire he had built up. Arsaces, of the Parnian tribe, a leader of a robber band Parthian (of uncertain descent) became first king of Parthia. fa™. 151113 ' Parthia occupied what is now the provinces of Khorasan and Mazandaran, and was then inhabited by Medes. The Parthians were Scythian nomads, and came originally from the banks of the Ochus (Atrak), and deserts near the Caspian; they freed themselves from the Macedonians and overran Parthia.6 B. 0. 223. 209. 161. H7 138. 92. 53. The war dress of the Parnian in Parthia was scale armour completely covering man and horse. They were a nation of cavalry and disdained to walk on foot. Their national weapon was the bow, and method of fighting was to make a series of attacks alternating with simulated flights, in which the rider discharged his shafts to the rear. Antiochus III, Magnus, suceeded to the throne of the Mace donian Empire and slightly revived it from decay. The rising power of the Roman Empire was now beginning to be felt. Parthia was subdued but remained a menace. Mithradates I, King of Parthia, had gradually extended his dominions as far as the Hindu Kush and part of India, and now turned his attention west. me had already taken Syria and Media, and now captured Babylonia, the East being thus lost to the Macedonians. Mithradates I died, having raised Parthia to the zenith of its power. The next few years its fortunes varied and many disastrous defeats were sustained. The Parthians, as lords of Mesopotamia, now came in contact with the Romans, which first resulted in alliance, afterwards in bitter hostilities. In the spring toe Romans, with 7 legions and 8,000 cavalry, some 42,000 men, under Crassus, crossed the Euphrates at Zeug- mah. Between Carrhse and Ichnas, the Parthians, concealing their main force behind wooded hills, drew the Roman cavalry away by threatening the flanks and by their favourite tactics of simulated flight, and surrounded and cut it to pieces. They then hovered round the demolished legions, who were suffering from heat, dust and thirst, galling them with arrows and charges! Nothing but the Parthian custom of withdrawing at nightfall to a distance from their enemy saved the Romans from annihila tion, and enabled them to retreat, leaving their wounded behind them. Crassus then attempted to withdraw his army to Syria and started by a night march towards the mountains. His troops wo i o thoroughly disorganized, the several divisions lost touch with each other, and became entangled in marshes. The Parthians treacherously lured them to the plains, and attackedthem. Scarcely 10,000 men reached Syria. The disaster was £ c - partly due to bad leading but principally to the Romans’ abso lute ignorance of the Parthian tactics and customs. The Par- thians lost much of the fruits of their victory, in not immediate ly following it up by an invasion of Syria. They made some futile attempts later, but failed to take advantage of the op portunities offered by the civil wars, preceding the fall of the Roman Republic. The struggle continued with varying success for many years. The Romans, numbering 40,000 cavalry and auxiliary troops iso. and 60,000 legionaries, under Antony, invaded the territory north-west of Media. Phraates, king of Parthia, collected some 40,000 men including probably 10,000 Median cavalry. Antony’s advance was checked by the Parthians cutting off his supplies. Phraates promised him peace if he would retire, and it being now October he agreed $ but the Parthians treacherously began a vigorous pursuit. The Romans reached the Araxes, 276 miles in 27 days, having suffered heavy losses in killed and wounded, and still heavier from famine, thirst, and dysentery. In the Armenian mountains, 8,000 more perished from cold and snow storms. The causes of the disaster were, the Roman ignorance of geographical and climatic conditions, a rash haste in earlier operations, and very largely (as in Napoleon’s Russian Campaign) to a want of discipline in the soldiers of the civil war. For a century and a half after this the Romans left the Parthians alone. These years were in Parthia a long succession of foreign and civil wars and internal anarchy. The Parthians were still the dominating power. Rome became consolidated under her emperors. The Emperor Trajan took Armenia, and the following year invaded Mesopotamia and the adjacent countries. A Roman.fleet descended the Euphrates; the ships were no. • conveyed on rollers across to the Tigris to co-operate with the army and descended that river to the Persian Gulf, Septimius Severus converted Nisibis, situated between the 195.

It was a point of great strategic importance as a base for expeditions. Some of the operations from here were most un successful, but the Parthian power was decaying. The kingdom of Persis, occupying what is now 'Farsistan, now came into serious conflict with the Parthians. Persis was strictly Zoroastrian and had a famous fire temple at Istakhr, the priest of which, Sasan, was the founder of the Sasanian Dynasty, the capital of which became Cesiphon near Seleucia on the Tigris. Ardashir, grandson of Sasan, who was to the Sasanian Dynasty what Cyrus was to the Archseme- nian, successively reduced Isfahan, Babylonia, Assyria, Media and Parthia, and the Parthian Empire came to an end. The Romans fearing the newly arisen King of Kings defeated him in battle. The rivalry continued many years and not seldom the tables were turned. This long struggle fills the most important place in Sasanian history. Ardashir is viewed as the restorer of the unity of Iran. His policy was not to have vassal states; so he reduced most of the States to provinces. Shapur I, became king. He had already distinguished himself against the Romans, and took their famous fortresses of Nisibis and Carrhae. 260, He defeated and captured the Emperor Valerian, but his subsequent invasions of Roman territory resulted badly. The Persian Empire was never able to stand prolonged campaigns, being poor. It had no great standing army like the Romans. Levies summoned to the standard could not long be kept together. Hence brilliant exploits without lasting results. 3io. Shapur II succeeded a line of weak rulers, and made himself famous by his campaigns against the Arabs, whose plundering inroads were beginning to be severely felt; and afterwards against the Romans, during a war whi h lasted 25 years. In this campaign Nisibis successfully held out through three severe sieges. Shapur’s successes bore little fruit.Rome concluded a shameful peace with Shapur, surrendering A. d. among other places Nisibis which now became for the Persians 3ca.' what it had been for so long for the Romans, a sure base tor an advance and a bulwark for defence.

The Arabs then gradually overran the whole Sasanian Empire, but it was not till between 640 and 642 that the “ Victory of Victories ” as the Arabs call it was won at Nehavand, a little south of the old high road from Babylon to Ecbatana. This ended the Sasanian empire. Yazdegird III the last of the kings fled to Merc, where he was murdered. The religion of Zoroaster was overthrown and its priests were slaughtered or fled to India or China. The majority of the populace were forcibly converted to Muhammadanism- Rule of the Omeyyah Khalifahs. Damascus was their* seat of government. Their Empire now extended besides Persia, over Syria, Jerusalem, Egypt, northern Africa to the Atlantic and Spain, and they had besieged and nearly taken Constantinople. It was against them that the crusades were made. Kutbah, Arab governor of Khorasan crossed the Oxus, subdued Bokhara, Samarkand, the whole country as far as the Sea of Aral, and finally Farganah to the banks of the Jaxartes (Syr Darya). The ‘Abbaside Khalifah, having rebelled, seized the gov ernment and defeated and exterminated the whole family of the Omeyyah Khalifahs. The city of Baghdad founded on the Tigris, 15 miles above the ancient Persian capital of Ctesiphon. This became the seat of government. Harun-er-Rashid, the hero of the “ Arabian Nights ’ ’ succeeded. He was the most illustrious of the ‘Abbaside Khalifahs, and a founder of Muhammadan laws amplifying those of the Quran and from here emanated the four Imams of the Sunnis. His faithful vizier and comrade was Ja'afar the Barmecide of Persian descent, whom he finally murdered. Baghdad became the most flourishing city in the East, but 50 years later was the centre of a luxurious and enervating civilisation till the vigour of the Khalifat passed away altogether. The Persians again began to regain power. Rebellions broke out and a little later Ismail Samani, a Tartar lord descended from a Persian noble, founded in Khorasan andII Bokhara the Samaui Dynasty, to which Persia owes the restora tion of its nationality. The Dailami Dynasty established their rule over Pars and Iraq. Sabuktagln a Turkish slave, assumed government of the petty principality of Ghazni. His son Mahmud, the famous conqueror, succeeded him Mahmud of and spent his whole life in the slaughter of his fellowmen Clhazni &gt; under pretext of spreading the faith of Islam. 997 ‘ Mahmud dethroned the last king of the Samaui Dynasty. 998.

His dynasty soon declined in power. Hordes of Turkish tribes, hardy, warlike men from the wddi of Turaa, led by the chiefs Tugril and Daud, poured ove^ ms?!* I ersia, and completely subjugated it as far as Baghdad, which vas still under the feeble rule of the Khallfahs’. Alp-Arslan, son of Daud succeeded to the rule of the new 1033 Empire.

Persia became divided amongst several petty princes called Ata-Begs, or Atabaks. Jingiz Khan or Tamujin, son of a Tartar chief, had fought his way to the throne, and was proclaimed Emperor of Tartary with his capital at Karakorum. Having conquered China, he burst forth from the wilds oi 'Central Asia at the head of vast Mongol hordes. Overran Balkh, Ghazni, Kandahar, Multan, Azerbaijan and Traq. tars submitted. He is said to have lost no less than 200,001) men, in these campaigns. Hulakin Khan, a grandson of Jingiz Khan, was sent with a large army to govern Persia, and extend his conquests to the west.° His first act wans to extirpate and root out the sect of the Assassins. He then besieged and captured Baghdad and killed the last of the ‘Abbaside Khalifahs, whose power for many years had been merely nominal. Mosul and most o. Mesopo tamia w r ere then subjugated. He established his capital at Maragheh south-east of Lake Urumieh, Argun Khan, grandson of Hulakin succeeded. He was hostile to Moslims, favoured Christians and was the first Persian ruler to enter into diplomatic intercourse with Europe. King Edward I of England sent an envoy to his Court, The famous Venetian Marco Polo travelled here about this time. &lt; Abu Sa‘ld, the last of the dynasty who enjoyed any power, died. His successors, to the time of Timur’s conquests, were mere puppets. The Mongol sovereigns of Persia were a mo^ remarkable race, as though they had just relinquished a wan dering savage life, they were renowned for their excellent g^ ernment, encouragement of literature and science, and epiign - ened toleration in matters of religion. Timur or Tamerlane born at Kesh, situated between the rivers Oxus and Jaxartes, belonged to a race of Turkis i w anaer ers and was of ancient and noble lineage. His early fortune- •were very varied : he was often reduced to great straights, anc underwent many dangers and misfortunes.13 His fortunes changed till he finally became ruler of Samar- ^o 6 ^ - lg69 kand. His army was most carefully organised and divided into detachments of 10 , 100 , and 1,000 men with leaders to correspond. Great attention was paid to supply of horses, arms, provisions, tents, and equipment for each man. Rules guiding the tactics of leaders were laid down. When choosing a position, to be near water, on ground higher than the enemy,-flanks and rear cov ered, ground in front extensive and open. Prisoners who had fought with valour to be treated with honour and respect. Timur completed his subjugation of the nomad tribes of 1378. the steppes of Ceatral Asia. Khorasan and Mazandaran submitted. In the following 1381. years he conquered Sistan, Kandahar, Azerbaijan and Georgia. He entered Isfahan and Shiraz, and.Iran now became one of 1387. his provinces. Timur performed his greatest military exploits by invading 1390 . 1391 . the illimitable wilds of Kipchak. From Tashkent as an advanc ed base, he led his army, in spite of deficiency of supplies, over arid wastes, to the north of the Caspian Sea ; thence to the banks of the Volga ; and defeated the'overwhelming numbers of the Khan of Kipchak in a series of brilliant cavalry engagements. He next conquered the whole of western Persia, and crossing 1391-1395. the Karun River took Baghdad. Thence to Georgia, and cross ed the Caucasus range into Muscovy. Timur now invaded the defiles of the Hindu Kush with 1398. 02,000 men. The mountain tribes retreated to the most inac cessible ravines. Timur had his whole army lowered by ropes from ledge to ledge, and brought them -to terms. He then marched to Kabul, and from thence invaded India and crossed the Indus. He then defeated the Indian Army near Delhi. Took Delhi and Muttra. Returned to Samarkand by Kashmir and the de files of the Hindu Kush. Timur re-took Baghdad and Damascus, and routed the 1402 - Turks at Angora. Timur died when on the march to invade the Chinese Em- ins pire. Shah Rukh, son of Timur, restored Herat and made it his H 08 , capital. Others of his descendant followed, The most14 famous was Babar, who, driven out of Herat, retreated to Kabul. From t lienee, some years later, he invaded India and, founded the dynasty of the great Moghuls. After the downfall of Timur’s family, the two Kurdish dynasties of the “ Black sheep” and “ White sheep ” reigned in Persia for a short time. Hasan, a Kurdish chief of the “ White sheep,” then only ruler of Diarbakr overthrew the “Black sheep” dynasty and finally became ruler of Persia. For the next 31 years a state of anarchy prevailed. For £-50 years now' Persia had been under the yoke of Arab, Turkish and Mongol conquerors, and the population owing to constant inundations of strange tribes, were very different to the ancient Persians of the Sasanian and earlier times. Ismail was proclaimed Shah of the whole of Persia, and the Sufi or Sufavl Dynasty was founded. From this period the modern history of Persia may be said to begin. Ismail was a descendant of Mirza Kazim, the 7th of the 12 Imams, venerated by the Shpah sect, who were put to death by order of the Khalifahs. His family through generations had en joyed a great fame for sanctity. Hence Ismail rvas styled King of the Shrahs. His early youth was spent at Ardabil in Azarbaijan. Having first conquered the whole of this province- he invaded ‘Iraq and in less than 4 years all Persia acknowledged him as ruler. He proclaimed the doctrine of the Shi'ah sect to be the national religion of Persia and thereby succeeded in consolidating the discordant elements which now formed the population of Persia. Surrounding them on every side were Uzbegs, Turks, Arabs and Atghans, all Sunnis or orthodox Muhammadans, and inveterate haters of the Shrahs. In this manner were the Persians closely united together in the defence of their religion, and the modern nation of Persia arose, Salim I, Sultan of Turkey, invaded Azarbaijan with 200,000 cavalry, infantry and artillery. Ismail with only 30,000 men, almost all cavalry, was defeated at Kh5I. This was his only uefeat, and was due to Salim s artillery, an arm the Per sians now meo for the first time. The guns were chained together to resist the shock of the Persian cavalry sA mission from Queen Elizabeth of England arrived, and was a. d courteously received. Shah ‘Abbas I - ruler of the whole of Persia—was the 1585 greatest sovereign Persia had known for centuries. He entirely subdued the Uzbegs. Re defeated the Turks and took from them Azarbaijan, 1604 _ Georgia, Diarbakr and Baghdad. Kandahar was captured from the Great Moghul. He fixed his capital at' Isfahan, beautifying it by magnificient buildings. Julfa was made a suburb for foreigners. Buildings, roads and bridges monument alise him to this day in many parts of Persia. Meshed, the burial place of the martyred ‘Ah Eaza, 8th Imam, he made a national shrine for pilgrims, instead of Makkah and Kerbala. Qum, the burial place of ‘Ali Raza's sister, became a second shrine. He maintained diplomatic relations with England, Spain, Holland and France, and received and sent embassies. He expelled the Portuguese from Hormuz island, having 162 2 . collected a tleet at Gombroon (Bandar ‘Abbas) with the help of the English East India Company. On the fall of Hormuz, Bandar ‘Abbas rose. English and Dutch factories were established there. Shah ‘Abbas died. His successors were cruel and degenerate, 1628 . and under them the Empire dwindled, though the court at Is- fahan increased in splendour and luxury, and foreigners were encouraged and protected. The hardy Afghan mountaineers, who for centuries had been Afghan practically independent, having defeated two Persian armies, invasion, threw od the last semblance of authority at Herat and Kanda har. Mahmud, son of the chief of one of the Ghilzai tribes of Ghazni, assumed sovereignty and with an Afghan army in vaded Persia. The following year he advanced on Isfahan. An ill-disciplined hastily collected Persian army, of 50,000 men with 24 guns, was routed with great slaughter and their guns taken, by the small but warlike handful of Afghans. Isfahan was invested. The Shah, Husain, abdicated in favour of Mahmud who entered the city, which was sacked, and most of its nobility and people perished in a series of appalling massacres.16 A.

Turkey and Russia both took advantage of this state of things to seize all the territory they could. A Russian flotilla under Czar Peter the Great, descended the Volga, and the Russian flag first flew on the Caspian. Mahmud died. His son Ashraf succeeded. Tahmasp II, son of Shah Husain, who abdicated at Isfa han to Mahmud, supported by Path ‘All Khan, chief of the Turkish tribe of Qajars, and by Nadir Quli a robber chief from Khorasan, had collected a small army in Mazandaran. Nadir, having murdered Path ‘AH Khan, obtained command of this army. Nadir defeated the Afghans in Khorasan, pursued them to Isfahan, defeated them again there, drove them down towards Shiraz, followed them up and again defeated them. Ashraf while attempting to escape to Kandahar w-as murdered by Baluchi robbers. Nadir finally threw off the mask and proclaimed him self Shah of Persia, thus ending the Sufavi Dynasty, which had lasted 223 years. Nadir, having taken Kandahar, stormed Kabul, and advanc ed through the Khyber, took Peshawar, and crossed the Indus at Attock. After a halt at Lahore he reached the plain of Kar- nal, having marched over 850 miles in 28 months. Here he de feated an arm 3 ^ of over 200,000 men, accompanied by 7 Muhammad Shah the great Moghul himself. Delhi was occupied and a frightful massacre of the population took place. The loot amounted at lowest estimate to considerably^ above 30 millions sterling, some writers put it at nearly 90 millions. This included the famous peacock throne which was carried off. Nadir returned to Herat, thence to Meshed, which he made his capital. John Elton and some English merchants attempted to open trade on the Caspian. Nadir was assassinated. Anarchy followed. The Durani Empire was now formed in Afghanistan under Ahmed Shah, who twice invaded India and in 1759 took Delhi. Karim Khan, chief of the Zend Kurds, after difficulties and defeats from Afghans and Qajars, ruled all Persia except Geor17 gia and Khorasan. He fixed Ids capital at Shiraz and ruled A.D. well and justly for the good of his people. The British factory was removed from Bandar ‘Abbas to 1775 Bushu-c. The Dutch occupied and fortified Kharij Island 30 miles from Bu,shire, as a trade emporium. At Karim Khan’s death, the usual internal dissensions fol- Q a j ar lowed. Agha Muhammad, chief of the Turkish Qajar tribe of Dynasty. Astarabad, escaped from detention at Shiran, collected his 1779- iiibesmen, and declared himself Shah of Persia, thus founding the Qajar Dynasty to which the present Shah belongs. Tehran was made the capital, as the provinces of GTlan, Mazandaran and Astarabad provided his chief supporters. Lutf ‘AH Khan, the last of the Zend Dynasty, a brave lead- 1793 . er and fine horseman, who had for years maintained a most gallant but hopeless struggle against Agha Muhammad, was be sieged in Kirman. The city was taken through treachery, and a general massacre of the inhabitants followed. It may bo mentioned, as an instance of the hideous atrocities of which Agha Muhammad was continually guilty, that he caused 1 0,000 ejmballs of the inhabitants of Kirman to be brought him on a platter, and counted them, with the point of his dagger. Lutf AH Khan cut his_way through the Qajar army and escaped, but was betrayed to Agha Muhammad at Bam, and after under* going every sort of indignity and torture, murdered at Tehran. All his family and friends were ordered to be massacred. At this time the power of Russia had increased, and she began to turn her attention to the rich Persian provinces about the Caspian. Agha Muhammad invaded Georgia, which had declared its independence under Russian protection, took Tiflis, massacred its inhabitants, and sold 15,000 women and children into slavery. Agha Muhammad was crowned Shah of Persia. He then 17 * 0 - seized Khorasan, tortured and murdered the blind Shah Rfikh grandson of Nadir Shah and Shah Husain, to extort from him the jewels brought by Nadir from Delhi. Agha Muhammad was murdered by his servants, while A I) - marching to meet the Russian armies, that had entered Georgia. He was the most inhuman monster that ever disgraced a throne.18 1802 - 1800 .

Russians overran the whole of Georgia and annexed much territory, defeating the Persian army near Erivan. Russian artillery caused heavy losses to the Persians. A few years later Great Britian presented some field guns to the Shah. Napoleon, on commencing his famous campaign against Russia, sent an embassy to Tehran, with several officers to drill the Persian troops. An offensive and defensive treaty between France and Persia was signed. The British Government, alarmed at French influence, sent a mission under Sir Harford Jones, who by his bold dictatorial manner carried everything before him. French officers were dismissed, and a treaty was signed to protect India from Afghan incursions, check French influence in the Persian Gulf, and open its ports to British and Indian traders. The war with Russia lingered on, the Russians making use of bribery as much as force of aims. There were so nip six British officers as instructors to the Persian army. After many reverses from the Russians, Persia signed a treaty of peace at Gulistan. Sir Gore Ousely, ^ the British envoy, acted as mediator. Russia retained Geor gia, I inertia, Mingrelia, Persian Daghistan, Shirvan, Ganj- eh, Karabagh and parts of Talish, which she had con quered, also°the ports of Darband and Baku and obtained the - exclusive privilege of maintaining warships on the Caspian, a right she exercises to the present day. Treaty of Tehran between Great Britain and Persia. Great Britain pledged herself to assist Persia with an army or subsidy of 200,000 tumans _annually, in case Persia was invaded, provided the Shah was not ^ the aggressor. Even if a European power at peace with Great Britain made war on Persia, she was still bound to assist as above. If the Afghans invaded India, Persia was to send an army against them. Persian rebels were to be expelled from British territory. A British representative was to reside permanently at the Shah s court,19 Catte® r. used Mti fl- feia few m ie Sii ligit a»ak 1 ofa fe asm tali flueEce.si ? 1 Ul tn.

At the beginning of the 19th Century, the Persian Gulf was an ^ infested by pirates, belonging to the Arab tribes which inhabit Wahabis, its shores. These were now joined by the fanatical Wahabis, an Arabian sect which had been formed some TO years pre vious! v The main tenet of the Wahabis was a life of sim plicity as enjoined by the Prophet, as opposed to a life of tyranny and luxury as led by the Turks. They were in fact the Puritans of Arabia. Most of the lawless tribes of the Gulf em braced the Wahabi tenets and became more desperate and auda cious than ever. They seized Bahrain and had various strongholds, the 1807. chief beincr Ras-al Khaimah, near Cape Masandam, command ing the straits of Hormuz. In large boats they attacked every merchantman they met, murdering everybody impartially. They even dared to attack British warsnips. A British expedition, consisting of a frigate with a force destroyed the stronghold at Ras-al-Khaimah and many piratical vessels. Assisted by 4,000 Oman troops, stormed the fort of ShTnas. land burnt they isio. Piracy and murder broke out afresh immediately the ex pedition withdrew. A small squadron and a land force of 3,000 men besieged im. and amin captured Ras-al-Khaimah and burnt 200 boats. The pfrates fought with bravery and nnutary skill, botli by land and sea. A detachment of native troops was left here but afterwards removed to Qishm, A British force, 7 officers and 303 men, was annihilated mo. near Sur. A British force, 1,282 European and 1,718 native troops, was 1321. despatched which utterly broke up the pirates power. I he rulers of Oman and Masqat were, throughout, the allies of Britain and abolished slavery in those dominions. A Bntish naval force was thenceforth permanently maintained on the Calf to suppress piracy, extend commerce, maintain the status 5 of to E! to put down the slave trade and to exclude foreign influences.20 A. D. 1821 . Basida on Qishm Island was established as naval headquar ters and necessary buildings were constructed there. War broke out between Turkey and Persia, the main cause be ing insults to Persian pilgrims to Mecca and travellers and mer chants in Turkish dominions. The Persian troops in Azarbaijau had been trained by British officers, and the infantry and artillery had become very efficient. A foundry under British artificers had been established at Tabriz, for casting guns, also a gun carriage factory and a powder mill. Under the deplorable mis-government of the Qajars, however, the power of the great Illat chiefs had been considerably destroyed, and the country deprived of a large number of irregular cavalry, which had hitherto been such a powerful factor in her military forces. The Xurds near Kirmanshah, had been disciplined by French officers’ The Persians were victorious both near Baghdad, and in the north near Bayazid. A terrible outbreak of cholera, whicli now appeared in Persia for the first time, prevented them fol lowing up these successes and closed the war. A treaty was made removing causes of rupture. Russia forced another war with Persia under pretext of unsettled boundaries. The Persian army, consisting of 20,000 infantry, 12,000 cavalry, 8,000 irregulars and 24 guns, crossed the Araxes (Aras), was attacked near Elizabethpol bv a Russian army of 6,000 infantry, 3,000 cavalry, and 12 owns, defeated and driven back across the river. The Russians besieged ‘Abbasabad. The Persians advanced to its relief. Russians crossed the Araxes on hides forming air bladders, and found them in a very strong position. The Russians concentrated their attack on their centre, and broke it and the Persians fled. ‘Abbasabad surrendered. A little later the Persians again crossed the Araxes \ battle was fought at Abbaran; the Persians made a gallant fight, and although defeated and driven back, inflicted verv severe losses on their enemies. Erivan, an important- fortress and magazine, fell into the hands of the Russians and Tabriz surrendered. Persia then submitted to the terms of Russia. A treaty was signed by which Persia ceded to Russia (he Khgnates of Eriva,n and Nakhohivan in perpetuity.

The frontier, west of the Caspian, was fixed from Mount Ararat along the Araxes or Aras to Astara. Persia, before embarking on this war with Russia, had never consulted the British Government, who now made this a pretext for offering her 200,000 tiirndns towards payment of Russia’s demands, on condition that the two articles in the Treaty of Tehran were abrogated, whereby Britain was bound to assist Persia with an army, or an annual subsidy, in the event of an invasion in which Persia was not the aggressor. The Shall in his desperate plight was forced to consent to this. It was unjust, because Russia was most clearly the aggressor. Great Britain’s influence in Tehran from that day declined and Russia’s steadily grew. Muhammad Shah, grandson of Path ‘All Shah succeeded to 1334 . the throne. Supported by British influence and by the arrnv which still had British officers as instructors, lie disposed of all rival claimants. Hajx Mirza Aghast, ids prime minister, was, however, entirely in the hands of Russia. Through Russian intrigues, the Shah was encouraged Siege of to besiege Herat, and, further, to foster designs for resuming suzerainty over Kandahar and Ghazni. Britain’s policy was to prevent Persia weakening herself by useless foreign wars, and by attention to internal affairs make her prosper ous and powerful. Russia calculated, that if Persia was de feated, she would be weakened, if successful, embroiled with Eng land. A pretext for the attack on Herat was the non-fulfilment of treaties, one of which agreed to the razing of the fortress of Ghurian. Tiiis fortress, however, fell after 10 days’ siege. The siege of Herat began in November and lasted 10 months. It was defended by Lieutenant Eldred Pottinger, an English artillery officer and was nearly reduced by famine, and once nearly fell by assault. The Heratis were short of guns and supplies, and the unusual mildness of the winter deprived them of a variable assistance from the climate. The Persian besieging force was 40,000 men and 80 guns. It was a desultory campaign in which intrigue and conspiracy were continuously22 i A. D. 183(3. 1839. 1841. 1842. 1843. working agencies, while military action was spasmodic. The Shah himself and Count Simonich, the Russian envoy, accompanied the army. The Government of India sent a small force of 387 sepoys to the island of Kharij near Bushire. The effect of this slight demonstration, backed by the strong representa tions of Colonel Stoddart, the British envoy, who was also jn the Persian camp, caused the Shah to withdraw his army from Herat. By the treaty of 1814, in case of war between Persia and A.ghanistan, (riGat Jjiitain was not to intorforc unless asked to by both parties. But the independence of Herat was even then an important factor in British policy. Also the Russian agents at Kabul and Kandahar were now intriguing with the rulers of those places, to join interests with Russia and Persia instead of England. This had the effect of making England a little later embark on her unfortunate enterprise of invadiiw Afghanistan. When Persia withdrew from Herat, Russia merely disavowed her agents. Mr. McNeill British envoy to the Shah, declared at this tune that Herat was the key of Afghanistan “ There is no impediment either from physical features or deficiency of supplies, to the march of a large army, from Georgia to Kan dahar, or even the Indus. Count Simonich drove in a car riage from Tehran to Herat and could have driven on to Kandahar Ihe Shah s army subsisted, during the low* siege exclusively on the supplies from the country round Herat and Ghunan, leaving the richer districts of Sab : ,awar and ai ah untouched. The country between Herat and Kanda har affords remarkable facilities for the passage of armies. !t wou.d be most hazardous to allow Persia to act as the pioneer o. Riissia, and break down the main defence of Afghanistan” British policy was based on this opinion for many years.

A new rupture was caused between Persia and Turkey this,year, 3,000 Persians having been massacred at Karbala. This was A. D terminated by the treaty of Erzerdm, by which Russia and 1842. Great Rritain were asked to decide the case, and demarcate the boundary. This was done. Muhammad Shah died. The close of his reign was marked 1848. by the rise of the sect of the Babls, and by a commercial treaty with England. The whole country was in a deplorable state. His son Nasir-ud-Din succeeded him. An insurrection took place in Khoi’aSan, supposed to be 1848-1851. due to Russian intrigues. Meshed was captured by the Shah’s troops after a siege lasting 18 months. Great persecution of the Babls occurred, thousands being killed. At Zinjan they all fell fighting after a long and heroic resistance. A Babl conspiracy and attempt to assassinate the Shah is 52 . took place. Herat was occupied by Persian troops. Under pressure 1853 . 'rom the British Government, tire Shah withdrew his troops from Herat and engaged not to interfere with it again. During the Crimean War England’s alliance with Turkey, 1851-1855. a Sunni Muhammadan country, displeased Persia, who then rather favoured Russia as less obnoxious. The Shah began fresh schemes of aggression against 1855 . Herat. The British envoy was insulted and ignored. He finally withdrew his mission to Baghdad. Bandar ’Abbas, the islands of Qishm and Hormuz, 1856. Minab and other places, held in farm from Persia by the ru lers o c Oman, were formally declared to belong to Persia and placed under the Governor of Shiraz. Dost Muhammad, Amir of Kabul, had just annexed Kandahar. The Persian Government, under pretext that he had designs on Herat, besieged that city with 30,000. men. The Persians proved themselves cowards, while the Heratis fought bravely ; and it was only a! ter 7 months, October to April, that the city was forced by famine to capitulate. The Persians lost 1,800 men, and the Heratis 1,500 during the siege,24 A. D. Anglo- I’ersiau war, 1856-1857. Negotiations between Persia and England were attempted at Constantinople. Herat fell on October 26th. On November 1st, the (Governor General of India declared war against Persia for breaking agreements and seizing Herat. Two courses were open to the Government of India for the invasion of Persia. (1) To march across Afghanistan. This would have been difficult and expensive, would have irritated the Afghans, and probably have brought on another Afghan war. (2) An expedition by sea to the head of the Persian Gulf. Thence direct operations against the interior. The latter alternative was adopted. On 11th November the first troops left Bombay. The expeditionary force embaiked at Bombay, Karachi and two smaller ports, in sailing vessels (towed by steamers) under the command of Major-General Stalker.

Total strength 5,670, fighting men, (of whom 2,270 were Europeans,) 3,750 followers, 1,150 horses, 430 bullocks. On 26th November, the fleet (8 Indian Navy steamers 7 steam and 30 sailing transports) assembled atQishm. Here it was discovered that the doolies and bearers had been left behind. Great confusion prevailed owing to the transports anchoring indiscriminately, ships carrying different amis were all huddled together, and the Brigadiers were ouite unable to exercise their commands. On 3rd December the Island of Kharij was occupied. On 7th December the force disembarked at Hallleh Bay 12 miles south-east of Bushire. This place was selected because the water there was good, landing easy, and no defences existed. There is a good landing beach at Bushire, but it is under fire.The disembarkation took two days, a strong north-west breeze having caused delay. The operation was covered by the fire of gun boats, which drove the 'enemy out of the date plantations. On 9th December, the enemy were dislodged from III shah r (Reshire) an old Dutch earthern redoubt, defended by T'angis- tanis and other half-Arab tribes from the vicinity. Under a combined bombardment by the fleet and field artillery the infantry assaulted. The cavalry then pursued the fugitives along the beach. Loss 4 British officers killed, one wounded, 35 non-commissioned officers and men killed and wounded. On 10th December, the plan of attack on Bushire was as follows :— gun boats to force the creek north-east of the town and cut off the retreat. Land forces to assault from the south and south-east. Fleet to commence bombardment when land attack was 2 miles distant from the walls. This was imperfectly carried] out. The fleet never forced the creek and began the bombardment too early; so the garrison escaped. Bushire surrendered before the land attack developed; 58 guns were taken also 2,000 Persian regular troops, who were liberated. Their arms consisted of Tower muskets presented by England for use against Russia. The sanitary state of Bushire was found to be bad. The troops encamped one mile outside the walls near the water- supply, a cavalry outpost with guns being posted two miles fur ther on towards the hills. The want of sufficient boats to land stores from the fleet was badly felt. The inhabitants brought in supplies and were Avell pleased to receive ready money payments, after their previous experience of Persian troops. The enemy had collected troops at Shiraz and were reported to be at Farrashband and advancing to Kalimeh. They had brought a considerable artillery train by a circui tous route, some 18-pounders coming by Firuzabad, and had established two supply depots, one at Chah Kutah, 20 miles distant, the other at Borazjun, 45 miles. Their chief trans port was small hardy donkeys. General Sir James Outram rvitli the 2nd Division of the expedition, consisting of the 14th Light Dragoons, the Scinde Horse, 1 Troop Royal Horse Artil lery, two Field batteries, 7Sth Highlanders, 23rd and 26th26 Bombay Native Infantry and a composite battalion consisting of 10 light companies of Native Infantry, left India in the latter half of December reaching Bushire at the end of January. Chah Kutah was first destroyed by a cavalry force. As the enemy were cutting off supplies from Bushire, an advance on Borazjun was then decided on. On 3rd February, General Outram left Bushire, taking 3 battalions British infantry, 3 battalions Native infantry, 3rd Bombay Cavalry, Poona irregular Cavalry and Horse and Field Artillery, total 419 cavalry, 18 guns, 118 sappers and 4,110 infantry. Practically no transport was available. No tents were taken and each man carried a great coat and blanket and two days’ cooked provisions. The commissariat arranged for bringing on reserve rations. The march was made by night, bitterly cold at this time of year. After 26 miles the force halted for the day. Severe dust storms followed by hail and rain, which drenched every one, and a cold piercing'wind made the march very trying. Borazjun was reached after another trying march and a night of cold and rain, the force having covered 46 miles in 41 hours. The depot was taken after a slight skirmish with the enemy’s cavalry, the entrenchments being quite insignificant. The village close by might have been utilised as a formid able defensive work, having high walls, towers.and a ditch 15 feet deep ; while all round it were cactus and thorn fences. All the ammunition and everything else that could not be carried off was destroyed. On 7th February, provisions running short, a retirement on Bushire was commenced by a night march. About midnight the guide lost his way, and the enemy attacked. The troops coolly formed up and lay down under fira till dawn, los ing, however, 2 officers and six men wounded and one man killed. On February 8th, when day broke, the enemy were seen drawn up with their right on Khushab and numbering 6,000 infantry, 2,000 cavalry and 15 guns. They were attacked by the cavalry and artillery, the infantry being in support. The artillery made very fine practice and the Persians broke and fled. The 3rd Bombay Cavalry charged and broke up a square of Per sian infantry.27 Mlsistiit the lattfl MIV, force, i s adrati e, tatiiij] atiy, Si and Fiei and 4,IIS -No lei mket ami : e ratk e of jtat st storii e, aDd i Bomjii itofeei ms, fk eneiiji i.

The force resumed their march that evening; the country had become a swamp. The roads were almost impassable, ankle deep in sticky mud, half clay half sand, and many men lost their boots. Ihe guides misled the force which marched throughout the entire night. The infantry reached Bushire on the evening of February 9th ; heavy rain was still falling, but the men were in excellent spirits. Arrangements were now made for an attack on Muham-Taw of mareh. F ive strong redoubts and a martello tower were M ukammarebi constructed across the isthmus at Bushire to enable a force of 3,000 men left there to resist any attack. Hospitals were prepared on Kharij island, as it was found healthy and possessed a good water supply and harbour. The force for Muhammareh consisted of 4,886 men and 12 guns, with a naval squadron of 4 steamers and two sloops. The embarkation at Bushire proved difficult owing to the shallow roadstead and Ingh winds. The transports assembled in the Shatt-al-Arab some distance below' its confluence with the Hafifar creek where strong Persian batteries had been erected and an army : of, io^OO men, under the personal command of the Shahzadeh, were in two camps near the village of Muhammareh. ihe opposite shore being Turkish territory and neutral around no landing could be made there. During the night 25th - 26th March, a raft with four mortars was established, concealed ehind an island in mid-stream, a few hundred yards from the mam Persian battery. At day break the warships moved un to this mortar raft and all opened fire. The Persian artillery was well served and made excellent practice against the ships out after three hours’ bombardment its fire was subdued and tne light draught transports and rafts, crowded with troops and lorses, were successfully passed up-stream to a spot hiffiier un where they disembarked. A shell fortunately exploded the grand magazine of the Persians just as this operation took place. Ihe 1 ersian army hastily retreated, blowing up their reserve ammunition, and leaving their camps and stores behind.28 ALwaz. They were followed up by a few of the Scinde Horse,' who had succeeded in landing. The 14th Dragoons and Horse Artillery had been delayed, ^ The British loss was 10 killed, one officer and 30 men wound- ccL In tlic 1 ersian batteries, 300 killed were found* These batteries were well and solidly constructed, provided vith embrasures and casemates, and revetted with trunks of date palms, which do not splinter. The interior was studded wit i pits full of water, to catch shells. Eighteen guns and mortars were taken. The inhabitants of Muhammareh, being Arabs, were most friendly. The troops suffered much dis comfort from myriads of flies by day, and sand flies by night, J On 29th March, three steamers, carrying 300 men from the 64th Regiment and 78th Highlanders, and each towing a gunboat with two 24-pounder howitzers, left to pursue the enemy up the Karun river to Ahwaz. A total want of baggage animals and paucity of cavalry prevented a pursuit being attemped by land. The Arabs along the Karun were friendly and supplied in formation. On 1st April, the Persian troops were overtaken at Ahwaz, where they were posted on the right bank of the river, the -town being on the left. There were some 2,000 cavalry’ among them some takntiaii horse and four larce bodies of infantry, possibly 8,000 strong. ^T he Aiabs gave information that Ahwaz and the supply depot there were only weakly held by oOO infantry and 30 horse. It was determined, therefore, to land and reconnoitre Ahwaz. This was safe, as the enemy had practically no means of crossing the river. To cover the movement a gunboat ascended the river, and opened fire with its two howitzers on the Persian army. The troops landed were disposed so as to conceal the weakness of their numbers. The garrison of the town retreated at once. The Persian army on the opposite bank, neither returned the gunboat fire, nor opened on the town. Cowed by recent defeat, exhausted by rapid retreat and starvation, the shells of29 i siwljj -tH logjji ^preriH i timtio; asstidU . areli, kiig mcIi fe d fc [j isai tas i toiii* i jk tk ofcarstj [ip]feiiii' arhbflj{ tlieriTR, (i taralj, tiofed ie siipplj ■ and Ji (affidtl! ically ® jrer.fi n anj' ablest' at ciift rned ti ; - ifCflt shells d the gunboat caused them to retire, which they did in good order. They probably thought that this small force was the advance guard of the whole of General Outram’s army, also, it is believed, they had only seven mule loads of ammunition left, so elected to risk starvation before reaching their next depot at Shushtar. It w as said that the Shah had ordered the Bakhtiarl tribes to close the passes to them, in case of retreat, so if General Outram had had at his disposal an efficient body of cavalry, wherewith to carry out a determined pursuit, the entire Persian army must have fallen into his hands. The whole of the supplies at Ahwaz were brought away, or presented to the friendly Arabs. The flotilla left for Muhammareh on the 3rd April, arriving there the same evening, with the help of the swift current. All ‘Arabistan was now at the mercy of the British, News Treaty of was now received of the treaty_of peace, concluded at Paris on 1&gt;an3 ’ March 4th. This ended the operations. The conditions of peace were—The Shah to withdraw his troops from Herat, relinquishing every claim of sovereignty over it, and to refrain from all interference with Afghanistan ; to recognise the independence of Herat; prisoners taken at Herat to be released without ransom. The British mission to be received at Tehran with apologies ; the slave trade to be sup pressed in the Persian Gulf and apologies to be made to Mr. Mur ray for the insolent conduct of the Shah and his minister. In May the troops were withdrawn from Muhammareh to Bushire or India. Bushire was occupied till October, pending the carrying out of the conditions of peace. Brigadier-General Jacob was left in command of the following troops—14th Light Dragoons, 3rd Bombay Cavalry, Scinde Horse, Poona Horse, Aden Troop, one troop Royal Horse Artillery, 3 light Field Batteries, 7 companies Foot Artillery and 4 Native Infantry regiments. During the occupation of Bushire, the inhabitants of the Personal town and surrounding districts were quite friendly. This was of the^expedi- also the case at^ Muhammareh.

Persia took possession of Sistan and made steady encroach ments eastward into Baluchistan. This caused trouble ^t h Afghanistan. An appeal was made to the British Government who were cvcntuaHy induced to appoint an Sistan Arbitration Commission 1872. 1873. 1879. 1 Colonel Goldsmid^ the head of this commission, after much Stag C 01 nmissionoi‘, gave' his decfaLn dividing Sistan between Persia and Afghanistan. Disputes however, continued rife, especially on the question of water’ from the Helmund for irrigation.Nasir-ud-DTn visited England. He also visited Russia, Germany, France and Austria, Persia obtained lier first loan, marking another step in 1892. her decadence, for from now on, she lapsed into a constant’ state of need and borrowing from England and Russia. Nasir-ud-Dln was assassinated. Succeeded by his second 1896. son, Muzaffar-ud-Din. His elder brother, Zill-us-Sultan, was debarred,- because his mother was not of royal descent. The Government of India opened a trade route from Quetta to Sistan. Russia disliked this, and established a protective cordon nominally against plague which stopped cara vans and paralysed trade. France tried to obtain 'a footing on the Gulf by means of 1899. a coaling station. Muzaffar-ud-Din travelled in Europe and visited Paris 1900 . Constantinople, and St. Petersburg. He again visited Europe, including England. 1902 . A Tarif convention with Russia unfavourable to England, was introduced. This afterwards was partly counterbalanced by a convention with England. Mir Muhammad Umar, a Baluchi Chief, who had previously 1901 - 1902 . given considerable trouble, fled to Persian territory, collected Operations a following of Persian tribesmen, and embarked on a course of Makran - border depredations. The Nazim of British Makran with 1,500 tribesmen attempted, unavailingly, to suppress him. The Persian SartTp of Bampur expressed his willingness to assist, but his indifferent troops and guns were powerless to capture three forts, held by the rebels near Dizak. The British Political Agent, Kalat’ with an escort of 200 infantry and 10 sowars, arrived and succeed ed in persuading some of the rebels to submit to the Sartip, but Mir Muhammad Umar remained at large and continued his de predations. The Persian Government willingly consented to the co-operation of British and Persian troops, in Persian Baluchistan, during the cold weather 1901-1902, to suppress him. The Persian Sartip of Bampur again expressed his willingness to assist. The Political Agent returned with an escort of 300 infantry, 50 cavalry, 20 Sappers and two mountain guns, and found the Nazim of British Makran had beseiged Muhammad Umar’s brother in the fort of Nodiz, in Kej, for 53 days, but having no guns, without result. The British escort, after bombardment by the guns, stormed the place. The whole garrison were killed, wounded or captured. British loss was 4 killed and 8 severely32 1902.

The forts of Irafshan and Magas in Persian Baluchistan were also taken, and the latter partly demolished. Muhammed Umar fled to Afghanistan. An Anglo-Persian agreement was drawn up by which Persia bound herself to maintain a garrison in Irafshan to maintain order. To secure peace further, the Makran Levy Corps was raised in 1904 commanded by an Assistant Political Agent, 137 Cavalry, and 203 infantry with Head Quarters at Panjgur. The question of the Sistan boundary had again become so acute that the Afghan Commissioner, wearied by the obstructive delays of the Persian Commissioner, crossed the frontier and came face to face with the Persian Sistan troops. The dispute was referred to the British Government. In January, a commission under Major McMahon with 11 British officers and an escort left Quetta. Major McMahon demarcated the frontier, arbitrated regarding a division of the waters of the Helmand and returned to Quetta in June 1905. The Commision experienced great transport difficulties and in 2| years 4,837 camels died. The cavalry escort lost 38 horses out of 73. Muhammad ‘AH Mlrza succeeded to the throne in January. His father Muzaffar-ud-Din had in 1906 signed a decree grant ing constitutional government to the people. A Majlis or Na tional Council of 162 representatives of all classes, elected by their peers, met that year. His son, however, on coming into power used every endeavour to cancel the decree. The result was two revolutions, which he managed to suppress. The Majlis had indeed assembled, but by no means satisfied the popular aspirations, and the distrust of the Shah grew. In October he signed a new constitution, but broke his pledges and forcibly dissolved the Majlis. This year was marked by a most important Anglo-Russ'an agreement to respect the integrity and independence of Persia, to preserve order, assist the peaceful development of the country, and to remove possible causes of friction by defining the respective spheres of influence of the two powers, and a neutral zone. Russia also acknowledged the special interests of England in the Persian Gulf. The Russian sphere is bound ed by a line drawn from Qasr-i-Shlrln, through Yazd andKhakh, to a point on the Persian frontier adjoining the intersection of the Russian and Afghan frontiers. The British sphere is bound ed by a line from Bandar ’Abbas, through Kirman, Birjand and Gazik, to the Afghan frontier near Gazik. See page 383.33 In June the Majlis was summarily dissolved by the Shah and towards the end of the year a third insurrection broke out, arising from the nationalist movement, and popular discontent at the Shah’s government. The centre of this was Tabriz which was invested by Royalist troops. The prolonged and stubborn resistance here, more than anything served to keep alight the flames of revolution and discontent. In January, Isfahan followed the example of Tabriz and revolted; the Bakhtiarls taking a leading part here, Mazandaran actively supported the Nationalists. The British and Russian representatives at Tehran observed strict neutrality, ■ and worked together to obtain a constitutional regime and effect a settlement between the Shah and his people. The Shah was urged by them to call to his council able and energetic men, and to grant a representative government. In February and March the Nationalist movement became predominant in Rasht, where the ferment was fed constantly by fiery revolutionists from the Caucasus and elsewhere. Yazd, Bushire, Bandar ‘Abbas, Hamadan, Shlrazand Meshed became National ist centres. Tabriz, besieged by the Royalist troops, was running very short of supplies. The situation there became so acute, that in April 2,000 Russian troops (this number was afterwards largely increased) crossed the frontier to protect the lives and property of foreigners and the siege was raised. Disorders also broke out in Bushire, which was cleared and order restored by a landing par ty from H. M. S. Fox. The Russian consular guards were increas ed at Meshed and Rasht. Electoral law had been grudgingly proclaimed by the Shah, elections took place, and the Majlis, or National Assembly, met on May 10 th, but it was too late, as all confidence in the Shah’s promises was gone. At the beginning of June the efforts of the British and Russian representatives to overcome this distrust became hopeless. On 26th June, the Bakhtiarls under Sardar As’ad had advanced from Isfahan as far as Qum, and got into touch at Kazvln with the Sipahdar and Nationalist forces from Rasht. At Tehran the palace official and upper classes were panic stricken. The Russian troops were occupying Tabriz, where their arbitrary and anti-Nationalist conduct was arousing Turkish distrust. There were fresh disturbances at Meshed where 100 more Cossacks arrived. In July, a Russian force of one battalion Infantry, 500 Cossacks, 4 guns and some sappers landed at Enzali and advanced to Kazvln. This move was not in accordance with British policy, as it was considered that it would exasperate National Revolution; 1908. 1909.34 the Nationalists, and make them think Russia was taking the part of the Shah. On July 13th the j oint forces of the Bakhtiaris under Sardar As’ad, and the Nationalists under the Sipahdar, entered Tehran, and became complete masters of the situation. The Shah took refuge at .the Russian legation, and was taken under Anglo-Russian protection. He then abdicated, and his son Sultan Ahmad Mirza, a boy 12 years old, was appoint ed successor to the throne, with Azud-ul-Mulk, head of the Qajar family, as regent. The occupation by Russian troops continued to excite suspicion and ill-feeling, in spite of Russian representations that it was only temporary. On July 25th, owing to the state of affairs in Shiraz getting worse and worse, a British detachment of 50 men with a maxim (1 naval lieutenant, 5 marines, 36 sepoys, 5 sowars with 1 British officer, 1 native officer and an assistant surgeon) was despatched there from Bushire. They arrived at Shiraz on 2nd August. Owing to the great heat two sepoys died of heat apoplexy on the road. This force was not sent till the last minute, as it was feared that it would accentuate the intense irritation already caused by the presence of the Russian troops in the north. Kirman was now threatened with an attack by Baluchi's. The withdrawal of the Europeans, some 25 in number ' includ ing several ladies, was impracticable. However, pressure was put on the Baluchis, and the danger was averted. On September 9th the er-Shah left Tehran, and embarked on the 30th at Enzali for Kieff in European Russia. After protracted negociations, the Persian government agreed to take over his debts to the Russian Bank, and allow him an annual pension of 100,000 tumdns, on condition that he surrendered to them his private estates. In October, Russia agreed to reduce her troops in Tabriz by one half, but no reduction was made at Kazvln and in ArdabTl owing to fresh disturbances, the Russian troops there now numbered 3,000. In November 1909, there were 1,000 Russian troops at Tabriz and they now agreed to keep only 60 men at Kazvln, and 400 Cossacks at Rasht and Enzali. In December, no Senate had been convoked. There were disturbances in Shiraz, and the roads about there were unsafe, owing to the lawless depredations of the tribesmen. The British force still remained there to maintain order.35 1910 .

In February, the Russians still had 1,000—1,100 men at Kazvln and Tabriz and also at Ardabll, which was the cause of irritation and mistrust to tho Persians. There was much diplomatic discussion. Russia de clared the state of the country was still very disturbed and the Persian government unable to cope with it, so a withdrawal of their troops was still impossible. In April, the British Consul at Shiraz was attacked on the road to Isfahan and two Indian sowars of his escort were killed. There was a conflict between the Cabinet and the Majlis and much internal discussion. The Cabinet was reconstructed. Aegociations for a joint Anglo-Russian loan to Persia were pro ceeding. It was the object of both powers to prevent Germany or any other power affording the loan and so obtaining an open ing for enterprise. In Juno, the Pars and Isfahan roads continued so insecure that trade was quite paralysed. Such is the official account of the Nationalist movement, but an eyewitness of the whole gives in the “ National Review’’ most interesting details and sidelights on the series of events, which resulted in the present regime in Persia, and on the first year of popular Government. Comparing the Turkish Nation alist movement with that of the Persians, it is justly remarked that_ the Young Turk party had in their hands a fairly efficient army; the Persians had nothing but a crowd of unpaid ragamuffins not worth consideration, and in addition, ^ it was doubtful if even a national or popular spirit existed. To the very last it seemed uncertain if the Nationahsts would succeed in entering Tehran, and deposing the Shah. ^ Two principal causes brought about the result. Firstly, as in India, Egypt and to a minor extent China, the ferment of European education and ideas of liberty and justice, (equality and fraternity play a small part in oriental revolutions)! Secondly, the co-operation of the Bakhtiaris, without which tlm Sipahdar would never have dared to advance. What their motive was in joining, is a mystery; they had no sentimental feeling about emancipating the Persians from the Q'ljar despotism, on the contrary they dislike and despise the Persians. As it turned out, mutual doubts, jealousies aud suspicions delayed the junction and advance on Tehran.The Bakhtiaris even among themselves were divided, one section was actually employed on the side of the Shah. The Sipahsalar’s force was mostly recruited from foreigners and adventurers ; and he himself inspired neither confidence nor enthusiasm; he was a relic of the old regime forced into the revolutionary ranks, and, being wealth} 7 , had much to lose. The “Mujahedin” (Nationalist Volunteers) as they called them selves displayed no fighting qualities in the preliminary skirmishes. By a stroke of luck, on July 12th the Royalist forces, after an indecisive skirmish, fell back in two divergent directions, leaving a gap, through which the Nationalists marched unoppos ed by night, found a city gate open to admit them, and occupied the Parliament House and the greater part of the city. The Russian-drilled Cossacks under Colonel Liakoff at first held out, but finally came to terms. The new government was confronted by a difficult and com plex task. The state was practically bankrupt, no money was coming in, and there was no income except the customs, which were mostly pledged to foreign loans. Azarbaljan was occupied by the Russian troops, who, however, certainly reduced the north to order, while in the south anarchy was rampart, British trade reduced to nil, and robbery and lawlessness every where rife. The first Cabinet of July 1909, included the Sipahdar and Sardar As’ad merely as figure heads, till the Young Persians should find it advisable to take up the reins of government. Meantime the actual power was retained in the hands of about 25 Young Persians, who hoped to control the ministers without sharing their responsibilities. Their insolence and under-ground machinations, however, soon caused them to dissolve, and meta morphose themselves into an advisory committee of 40 mem bers, which included some of the chief personalities of the Cabi net. Finally the Sipahsalar and Sardar As’ad resigned, and took their seats in the Majlis as simple deputies ; the new Cabinet contained some of the most progressive of the Young Persians. Many members of the National Assembly were violent, unreason able extremists, devoid of practical experience and education, whose one idea was to declaim against the tv'O Pow-ers, who alone held the country from complete disintegration, and hurl accusations at responsible ministers. It is not surprising that ministers resigned again and again, and there w ere perpetual Cabinet crises. Asa natural result, the administration of theprovinces was in absolute chaos. Not one of the Young Persians having the executive experience, character or authority- necessary to govern a province, they had to fall back on offi cials of the old regime as governors and governor-generals. The powers of these were nevertheless curbed by the appointment of young inexperienced men of the new order in the remaining offices, who checked and thwarted them at every turn. Thus the old order and new were intermingled in bewildering confu sion. The young men suddenly elevated from absolute no- bodies into personages, became inflated with preposterous ideas of their own importance; and the old officials, regarding them contemptously, would end the new order on the spot if they could. The popular assemblies elected at each provincial centre dis played neither initiative nor energy, and, beyond worrying the executive authorities on absurd trivialities, did absolutely no thing. Public opinion as directed towards the administration of a country, even with popularly elected deputies, cannot be evoked in an instant in a nation like the Persians, accustomed for cen turies to autocratic rule. The deputies, many of them Mullas, meet, chat and smoke, but have not the vaguest idea of how to conduct public business. The conclusion is that the period of preparation here was too short, and the national spirit too supine, for evolving men of the right stamp, and except for reactionary and greedy Shi'ah Mullas on the one hand, and violent Turkish and Caucausian revolutionaries on the other, no men of character and natural gifts appear to exist in Persia of to-day. Towards the end of 1906, it became evident that the arms traffic in the Persian Gulf was assuming dangerous proportions. Masqat had developed into an entrepot for extensive trade with ahm A rabia, Persia and Afghanistan. It was decided to bring the Persian Gulf case before the arms conference, assembling in Brussels early in 1909-1910. 1908. France, Italy and Great Britain made, in December 1906, an agreement for control over the arms traffic from Jibuti in the Red Sea. In 1907-08 large consignments of arms were landed on the Makran Coast. Some captures were made by the ships of the Royal Navy- involving collisions with Afghan traders. In March 1909 the Navy captured some 1,500 rifles, The Brussels Arms Conference closed, without giving any decision on the subject of Masqat and the neighbouring coun-38 tries. In the autumn of 1909 there was great activity among the arms traders, especially the Afghans. Their modus opcr- andi was to purchase and despatch arms from Masqat to Per sia, through certain Balueh and Persian chiefs of the Makran coast. These arms were transported a short distance inland to convenient depots, whence they were removed, as opportunity offered, to Afghanistan; many of them eventually finding their way into the hands of the north-west frontier tribesmen. An active Naval and Military blockade was therefore organ ised to suppress this, as follows — (a) Foui of His Majesty s cruisers with other ships pat rolled the Gulf, and launches, etc., were used for in shore work. (b) A landing force was embarked on board R. I. M. S. Hardingt. consisting of battalion of Indian Infantry, tw o mountain guns, a section sappers and mineis, for operations ashore when required, from January to April. (c) G. S. 0. for intelligence was posted at Task. (d) A wireless station was erected at Jask for communi cation between the naval and land forces. 1911 . (e) Jask and Chahbar were put into a state of defence, with 2 machine guns and garrisons of 135 and 115 men respectively. (/) Measures were taken for arresting arms traders pro ceeding to ihe Gulf rid India. (g) l Battalion of Indian infantry was stationed at Robat. These measures were successful. Arms captured, con fiscated, etc., amounted to :—• Rifles—12,409. Pistols—-217. Ammunition, Rifle—-2,138,620 rounds. Pistol—-3,500 rounds. Several depots of arms were destroyed by naval and mili tary landing parties. During the spring of 1911, there were large numbers of Afghans in 1 ersian Makran, engaged in the arms traffic. The “I 0 ' COI J raba ^ d car g° e3 from Masqat was on a large scale, the profits of the trade, to all concerned, being very considerable.39 To chock this recrudescence of activity the following force was mobilized on 29th March :•—■ 104th Wellesley’s Rifles, 2 Sections, 32nd Mountain Battery, 2 Sections, Mo. 19 Compam^, 3rd Sappers and Mi ners, 2 Sections, Ro. 151 Indian Field Ambulance, under the command of Colonel Delamain, D.S.O. The Royal Indian Marine transports “ Northbrook ” and “ Hardinge” sailed from Bombay on 7th April. On the 10th April the whole force, together with a party of Marines from H. M. S. “ Highflyer,” disembarked at Galag on the Makran coast, and was joined by the principal local Baluch chiefs. The force advanced up the valley of the Rapch river to Barkaban. On 16th April, Colonel Delamain, with 90 men mounted on mules, pushed on to Bint, The AfglHns retreated north wards. The whole force re-embarked on 21st April, and, on 25th April, disembarked at Sirik on the Blaban coast, to capture some arms which had just been landed there, for Barkat Khan, a local Baluch who was assisting the Afghan arms-traders. On 28th April, the force attacked the Pushak defile which was held by about 160 followers of Barkat Khan’ After a sharp engagement the enemy were driven off. One British Officer and three men of the 104th Rifles were wounded. The enemy’s losses were estimated at 8 killed and 24 wounded' Forty rifles and 4,000 rounds of ammunition were recovered out of . the consignment landed at Sirik. The force was re-embarked on 8th May, and returned to India. The moral effect of these operations was considerable. The Afghans were discouraged, and the local Baluch Chiefs understood the inadvisability of participating openly in the illicit arms traffic. T/ie attempt of the ex-Shah, Muhammad ’AH, to regain his Invasion by Throne. tha ez-siuh. On 18th July 1911, the ez-Shah landed at Gumish Tappeh with a few followers. At the same time, his brother, Salar-ud-40 Dauleh, raised a following in Kurdistan, chiefly Kurds and Lurs, and proclaimed his brother as Sh^h. The ex-Shah was joined by about 400 Turkomans and seized the town of Shahrud. Salar-ud-Dauleh occupied Sinneh. During the latter part of July the ex-Shah’s following was augmented by Turkomans and local malcontents and adven turers. His main force, about 2,000 men under Sardar Arshad, occupied Dsmghan on 7th August, after defeating the local garrison. The ex-Shah himself, with about 1,000 Turkomans advanced along the coast road, vici S'ri, to Barfurush. Salar ud-Dauleh entered Kirmanshah on 31st July, with about 2,000 men and his following soon increased to about 6,000. He then occupied Hamadan without any opposition. By levying con tributions of money and of provisions from the towns occupied, Salar-ud-Douleh was able« to keep his force supplied, and the prospects of loot attracted to him a large following. In Azarbalj a n considerable numbers of Shahsavans rallied under Shuja-ud-Dauleh, to support the er-Shah. This force, however, achieved nothing, and soon melted away. On 5th September, a Government force from Tehran, about 1,000 strong, and consisting chiefly of Bakhtiaris under Sardar Bahadur the son of Sardar As’ad, and Armenians under Yprim, the chief of the Tehran police, defeated Sardar Arshad’s force of 2,000 men, west of Aradan, which is about 60 miles east- south-oast of Tehran. The Government troops captured 4 guns and 200 prisoners, including Sardcr Arshad, who was shot. As a result of this decisive engagement the following of the ex-Shah dispersed, and he himself, with a few followers, fled back to Gumish Tappeh. Salar-ud-Dauleh, having hung back until his brother was disposed of, now proclaimed himself as Shah. On 14th September he occupied Sultanabad, and by 20th September had advanced as far as Nubaran. The Government forces, under Sardar Bahadur and Yprim, left Tehran on 24th September to oppose him. On 28th September, Salar-ud-Dauleh was decisively defeated south of Zarand, 70 miles west-south-west of Tehran. Salar- ud-Dauleh fled to Hamadan, and his followers dispersed. The Government troops entered Hamadan on 4th October and captured 13 guns.42 Eastern frontier. crest of the mountains overlooking the Russian ports in Talish on the Caspian, to which sea it descends at Astara. &gt; hus tar the boundary is the result of the Treaty of Turkmanchai 1828.. It follows thence the southern coast line of the Caspian to Hasan Quiz Bay. From here the Russian maps do not altogether con form with the British, though the boundary was fixed in 1881 by a Russo-Persian Treaty. It should be the course of the Atrak as far as Chat, where it leaves the river, and passes obliquely west of the Sumbar to a point within 15 miles of Kizil Arvat, and then turns towards the Tekke range to Darrell Gaz, passing on to the Tejen at the great Persian fortress of Sarakhs ; a total distance of about 1,300 miles. The eastern frontier is from Sarakhs to the centre of Gwatar Bay on the Arabian Sea, some 950 miles. From Sarakhs it fol lows the Teien river to Zulfikar where Russian, Persian and Afghan territories meet. South of Hashtadan is a dispute! tract which was settled by General MacLean in 1891, but is stilt not properly defined. The general direction is somewhat as follows. Conforming to the Hari Rud as far as near Ivuhsan, it runs almost due south to the northern boundary of Sistan. Thence after following the Helmand to the Band-i-Sistan it takes a south-west direction to Kuh-i-Malik Siah, where British Afghan and Persian territories meet. The boundary between Persian Sistan and Afghanistan was fixed by Sir F. Goldsmid and a British commission in 1872, and ao-ain in 1902-05 by an arbitration commission under Colonel McMahon, fresh disputes having arisen owing to the H'elmand altering its course. In 1896, a boundary commission under Colonel T. H. Holdich was detailed to work in conjunction with a Persian delegate, for the delimitation of the Perso-Baluch frontier between Kuhak and Kuh-i-Malik Siah. The boundary was fixed from Kuhak as far ' north as Gurani, on the Talab river, on the west side of the Hl- man-i-Mashkhil, and boundary pillars were erected. Owing to the scarcity of water, the boundary Commissioners were unable to proceed beyond this point. The remainder of the Perso-Baluch border, from Guram to Kuh-i-Malik Siah, ivas only provisionally ao-reed to by the Commissioners, on data furnished by a native Indian surveyor and by local native inhabitants. No boundary ctillars were erected in this section. From Kuh-i-Malik Siah, theprovisional boundary follows the crest of the Kacha moun tains andthe river Talab in a south-east direction to Gurani on the west side of the Hainun-i-Mashkhil. Thence the fixed boundary runs due south for about SO miles, after which, by a bend first to the east and then south, it includes Kuhak in Persian territory. The southern portion of this frontier, from Kuhak to Gwatar Bay, usually termed the Perso-Maktan boundary, was fixed by Sir F. Goldsmid in 1871. The southern frontier of Persia is formed by the Arabian Sea, Southern the Straits of Hormuz, and the Persian Gulf. It extends from frontier - Gwatar Bay on the east to the mouth of the Shatt-al-Arab on the west, a distance of about 1,100 miles. The principal islands along the coast are Kharij, Qais, Qishm, Hormuz and Larak. The western, or Perso-Turkish, frontier runs from the mouth of Western the Shatt-al-Arab to Mount Ararat and is about 750 miles in frontier ' length. Leaving the Shatt-al-Arab, between Muhammareh and Basrah, it runs in a northerly direction to the west of Pusht-i- Kuh passing a few miles eastof Khaniqln. Then after following the Diala river for some distance, it runs in a general north-west direction to Mount Ararat and the Aras river, passing to the west of Maku. An Anglo-Russian commission for the settlement of this frontier 'was appointed in 1843. The result of its labours, which lasted over 25 years, was a careful survey of the disputed tract, rather than the delimitation of the frontier. A partial conclusion was arrived at in 1880 by a special Anglo-Russian commission, but the frontier has never been properly demarcated, and this at the present day is a continual, source of friction between Persia and Turkey, and complaints of violation of the boundary line. The territorial claims of the two countries bear chiefly noon Kurdistan, and the respective tribes which inhabit that region. The district of Zuhab in the province of Kirmanshah is another contested spot. The Elburz range is connected eastwards with the Pamirs Mountains, by a range that runs past Meshed; and westwards the moun- Norther n system, tains of Azarbaijan are connected with those of Ararat and the Caucasus, so it may he regarded as a link between the two. The range may be divided into a western and an eastern system at the latitude of Astarabad. The western system begins m the44 north-west from the mountains in Talish, and follows the line of the south-western and southern shores of the CaspianSea. The northern slopes are clothed with dark forests, and luxuriant vegetation; the southern slopes are precipitous,and, except for a few juniper trees, mostly bare. Numerous small rivers and streams flow from then sources in these heights to the Caspian; these are generally dry for the greater part of the year, but in the spring become rapid torrents, and in many places quite un- fordable. The most important peaks are Kuh Darfak (9,06) feet) nearly south of Basht, Kuh Kachan (12,200 feet) north of Tehran, and Damavand (18,600 feet) north-east of Tehran. This is the highest and most important mountain in Persia, it is a landmark for sailors on the Caspian, and for travellers from the south. On its summit the snow remains in patches through out the summer ; it is a volcano, but whether extinct or not is uncertain. Another peak here is the Kuh-i-Nizwa (13,500 feet) north of Saninan. The eastern system of the Elburz extends in a serried unbroken line for 100 miles to the Naudeh valley, where it spreads out, forming a broad expanse of hilly country, extending north as far as the Atrak. The range loses its covering of for est beyond the Kuh-i-Zlrkahl, and becomes bare and rugged ; but there are numerous plateaux, for the most part fertile, °weli watered and capable of supporting a considerable population, 'the Aleh-Dagh is a high mass of mountains above the plain of Bujnurd; and to the south-east of it is the Kuh-i-Mihrabi of about the same height and of greater extent. The highest points here are 10,000 feet or more—about 5,000 feet above the level of the northern plains, and 4,000 above the southern. Ihe general direction of the various ranges, into which the system is broken up, is south-east. The passes available are few and some would be closed in winter, nhey will be considered under the heading of communi cations. The Elburz mountains abound in coal, lead andiron. Coal is found in two places within 30 miles of Tehran, and the whole range is regarded as a good fuel distr ct. Azarbaijan is a mass of mountains. Of these. Mount Savalan, west of Ardabil, 15,792 feet, is the eastern termina tion of the Qusheh Dagh range, and to the north-west of it the Kara Dagh run up to near Julia. The mountains are celebrated for their coal deposits, and a quantity of other valuable mine- *rals. The Sahand mountains south of Tabriz rise to 11,000 feet, and are of volcanic origin. This system occupies the western, south-western and south- westta south ern quarters of the country. It consists of a series of moun- East system, tain chains, which, extending from the Armenian highlands, run parallel to one another, with extraordinary regularity, in a south easterly direction through Luristan, the Bakhtiar! country, and Ears, and thence follow a more easterly direction through Baluchistan, roughly parallel to the s e a coast. The general trend of these mountain chains, from north-west to south-east, has an important bearing on the question of communications across the Perso-Turkish frontier, or leading inland from the Persian Gulf; the construction of roads or railways being a matter of comparative difficulty or ease, according as the route selected lies across, or parallel to, the trend of the mountains. Commencing from the north-west, the mountains west of Lake UrQmieh form a natural frontier boundary at their crest line between Persia and Turkey, but this does not prevent con stant disputes and friction between the two countries as to the correct alignment of the border. Further south certain ranges, called generally the Zagros, again form a boundary between Turkey and Kurdistan and Luristan- There are only four main passes over them, the remaining crossings being merely goat tracks. The following description of the Pusht-i-kuh in south-west Luristan is typical of the mountain ranges about here. “ The steep slopes of the lofty ridges are covered with thin oak forest. In the valleys there is no vegetation. The rivers are all fordable with stony beds. The roads are awful, in fact they are not roads but paths, difficult both for pack animals and pedestrians. The highest peak here is the Manisht Kuh, 9,500 feet, which has a flat sum mit : the upper portion is a cliff 500—600 feet high, lower shopes, rounded spurs of broken shale, with oaks and wild undergrowth.” South-west of Hamadan are the Alvand Mountains, highest point, 12,290 feet. These are noteworthy as the main road from Kirmanshah to Hamadan passes over them. The Bakhtiarl country is a complete section of the Zagros mountains, and may be said to mark the south-east end of that46 range’s existence as a distinct chain. To the north its bound ary is roughly speaking the water parting between the Central icrsian river system, and that of the Persian Gulf. To the sout.i, the hunt of the foot hills of the Zagros is also the limit oi the Bakhtiai’i territory. The Bakhtiarl mountains may be divided into (1) The Outer Range, i. e., nearer to Central Persia. (2) The Inner Range, nearer to the Persian Gulf. Ihe highest peaks run up from 12,000 to 13,000 feet n the Outer Range these are, Shuturan, Jehan-bin and Shahan Kuh. In tne Inner Range, .Kallac Kuh, Kuh i-Raim, Zard Ruh, rs iana Kuh and Sabza Kuh. South of the Inner Range, tier after tier of hills succeed each other in a con used mass, retaining, however, their north-west 1 'a s « u . t { 1 ; ea f.* rea d» and gradually decreasing in height as the ‘AiabiStan lulls are approached. This mighty mass of moun tains has precipitous gorges, through which the Karim and Dm rivers force tortuous courses. Valleys usually run parallel to the ranges, their bottoms remaining at fairly constant eleva- tions, giving easy gradients for- the main tracks, which generally follow the banks of rivers. “ J Snow hes on the north side of the Imic the year.

The altitude of the intervening valleys, which follow the same trend as the ridges, gradually increases in height till the central plateau is reached. The Kuh-i-Dina north-north-west from Shiraz, is about 14,900 feet high. Khurmuj a well-known peak south-east b v east from Bushire, is only 6,430 feet, but a good land mark from the Gulf and surrounding country. The same mountain system similarly passes through the province of Kirman, which, to the south, is_a very mountainous region. Some of the ranges, as Jabal Bariz, x'each an altitude of 14,700 or even 15,000 feet. They are covered in places with oak scrub. Many of the valleys are well-cultivated and have good orchards. In winter, snow sometimes blocks the higher passes. The Chehil Tan or TaftSn Range, situated about the centre of the Sarhad plateau, elevation 12,463 feet, is volcanic. The same applies to the Kuh-i-Bazman in Persian Baluchistan, north of Bampur which is 11,217 feet. In comparison with these altitudes the Kuh-i-Ginau, IS miles from Bandar ‘Abbas, is 7,783 feet. Tins mountain system finally ends in Baluchis tan, the ranges rising to close on 13,000 feet. The uniform trend, however, is broken up here. The mountains in the eastern districts of Persia are on a Eastern system, less strongly defined system than in the north, west and south, since they do not here constitute the boundary of the great Iranian plateau. There are, however, a few well-marked ridges, the general trend of which is more or less from north to south. Of these the most noteworthy are— (1) The Mirjawa Range, which extends in a south-easterly direction past Kuh-i-Malik Siah, a low black hill, 5,632 feet ele vation (height of surrounding country is here over 3,000 feet), where the boundaries of India, Persia and Afghanistan meet, to Mirjawa, and forms the provisional Perso-Baluch frontier line for about 100 miles. Of this system the Kacha Kuh range rises to 7,762 feet, and a peak just south of Robat to 7,772 feet, (2) Kuh-i-Baqaran, running east and west just south of Blrjand. These hills are bare and slatey, of various colours, and covered with snow in winter. Around the bases the ground is very fertile, Highest point 8,358 feet.erg. Hurl.

(2) Into Lake Urumieh in Azarbaljan. (3) Into the Persian Gulf. (4) Into the deserts of Central Persia. (5) Into the Hamuns of SIstan.

Owing to evap„?atotd the amomt drawn off for .mgation, especially near Zulfikar, the voW 0 water is less m the lower reaches of the river than in V,! Hence observations show (in May 1894) 7 feet rWn paces broad at Pish Bobat; and!at Pulikhltt, tL'^wn 4 feet deep and 50 paces broad. An important tributary, ISKashaf Rud, joins it at Pul-i-Khatmi. There is a bridge of masonry with 6 arches at Tirpul, 80 yards long with 11- foot roadway. The only other bridge is a stone one at Pul-i-Khatun, restored by the Russians. There are, however, various fords. Below Herat there is a ford at Zinda Jan which • can be used during flood time ; this occurs at the melting of the snows, viz. the beginning of March till May. The Tejen river is a continuation of the Harl Rud, below Tejen. Sarakhs. It has a very diminished stream, and in the dry sea son there is sometimes no water in it at Sarakhs. It gradually loses itself in the sands of Turkistan. The Central Asian railway crosses it by a 2-span lattice girder bridge. The Kashaf Kud, or Tortoise river, also known as the Ab- Kashaf. i-Meshed, rises in the Chinaran sub-district of Meshed, close to the Chashmeh-i-Gllas. It flows first north-east and after crossing the Kuchan-MesHed road turns south-east and then east to Pul-i-Khatun, where it joins the Hari Rud after a course of 130 miles. Its volume and potable quality vary ia an extraordinary degree during summer and autumn. This is due to water being drawn off for cultivation, followed by the accession of sometimes fresh and sometimes brackish tribu taries. From Baghbaghu to Ak Darband it is quite undrink able. Between Pul-i-Khatun and Kuzqan, it is difficult to cross, except at recognised places, owing to the steepness of its banks and the treacherous nature of its bottom, which is mud of a quick-sand type. It is particularly dangerous between Langa- rak and Ak Darband. In summer the water is so low, that it is nowhere impracticable ; but in winter it is impassable, though so narrow as to be easily bridged. Above Meshed are numerous fords, below but few ; the best and easiest is at Baghbaghu. There are many canals at right angles to the river which are sometimes more difficult as obstacles than the river itself. A number of important roads cross it at various points. There are three bridges over it, all of stone and solidly built; two north of Meshed on the road to Chehcheh and Dushaklq the third south of the town of Meshed near Kuzqan on the road to Pul-i-Khatun. _ The Atrak rises near Tabarik about 17 miles north-east of Atrak. Kuchan, and pursues a westerly course to the Caspian, into which it falls at Hasan Quli Bay after a course of 300 miles,50 A few miles above Chat it is joined by the Sumbar; from'here to near its delta it flows along the bottom of a steep-sided ra vine, with 40 to 60 feet banks,'and a breadth of 400 to 1,200 yards. The river runs along this in a channel 12 to 30 feet wide and of an average depth of 5 or 6 feet; but in places much more. Fordable points are at long intervals apart and only exist from the end of August to the end of January. About a quarter of a mile below Chat, however, there is a ford nearly always passable. At the point Avhere the Astarabad-Chikishliar telegraph crosses, it is about 30 feet wide, and 3 feet deep when not in flood, much water having been drawn off for irrigation, and absorbed by marshes near its mouth. The banks of this river are not nearly so fertile as the Gurgan plain. The Gurgan river, rising on the plateau of Armutli, flows west, and, after a course of 200 miles, falls into the Caspian to the north of Astarabad Bay. Near its mouth its banks arc frequently overflowed and the country becomes a morass. Though its waters are deep, boats of lightest draught cannot ascend owing to the extreme shallowness of the Caspian Sea at its mouth. It measures about 25 yards from bank to bank, increasing to 40 yards below Gumish Tappeh. It becomes very swollen after the melting of the snow, and occasionally after summer rain. At other times it is shallow, but even then only fordable at a few points below Ak-Kaleh, where there are bands and a fordable line runs obliquely across the stream. The river bank is generally an almost vertical earth cliff. At Ak- Kaleh this bank is 14-16 feet high. Access to fords is either by a roughly tom rain gully, or a steep ramp worn parallel to the river by the descent of animals. From the mouth for 4 miles up-stream it is quite unfordable, though the height of the bank diminishes very considerably. The course winds but little. Ordinarily it has a current of about half a mile an hour, in flood between 3 and 4 miles an hour. It contains good drinking water and the ground on both banks is very rich. In its upper reaches it runs in a wide deep valley, but at Gumbad-i-Kabus in a narrow bed 30 feet deep, quite invisible at a short distance. Both banks here are steep and bare. In November^ at this place the channel is 5 or 6 feet deep with a width of 20 feet. There are three slight wooden bridges, one at Ak-Kaleh, one at Oba-i- Aneh Khan J’afarbai, and one at Oba-i-Haji Muhammad Khan, about 4 miles lower down.51 fromltK •■sided &amp; 0 to 1,1 to 3(1 Itij laces mi and oi y.

Prom the foot of the Damavand mountain it bends north, and enters the Caspian near Amul after a course of about 100 miles. In its upper reaches it is a mountain torrent; lower it runs in deep narrow channels, crossed by a number of wooden bridges, and finally en ters the plains for the last part of its course. At Amul it is very broad, but not more than 2 feet deep, unless swollen by melting snow, which in the spring make it very full and rapid. It is crossed at this point by a masonry bridge of 12 arches, this being the main road crossing the Elburz Range from Amul to Tehran. Along the south coast of the Caspian numbers of-similar rivers drain from the Elburz into that sea. The Safid Bud is the name given to the Kizil Uzun (the red Safid Rud. long river) from Manzil, where it is joined by the Shah Bud, to the Caspian Sea, which it enters about 40 miles east of Enzali. At Manjxl there is a bridge. In spring it becomes an impassable torrent. There is a ferry a little west of the village of Rasht- abad on the road fromRashtto Lahijan, where the river is 100 yards wide or more. Below Rudbar it enters the plains of Gilan, and flows with a moderate current between low and swampy’banks. It is only navigable, for small boats, near its mouth, where the depth varies from 3 to 7 feet. Here there is an extensive sturgeon fishery for the manufacture of caviare, the men employed in this industry being chiefly Russians. The Kizil Uzun, of which the Safid Bud is the continu- Qizil Uzun. ation, rises in Ardalah about 20 miles north-west of Sinneh. Its upper course is extremely tortuous, and runs at times between precipitous banks. Near Karagul it is fordable at times, but difficult and dangerous owing to the rapidity of the current, and the masses of rock which are brought down the stream and which constantly change the fords. The water is at its lowest in November, and the river then fordable; but in the spring the only possible crossing is by rafts. Lower down there is an'easy ford, 3 miles from Maman ; the river is here shallow and narrow except when the snows melt. At 8 miles above Alvar it is crossed by a fine bridge of six arches.52 t Aris. The Aras (or Araxes) forms part of the northern frontier of north-west Persia. It rises in the Bindagh mountains south of the Erzerum District of Armenia, takes a general easterly di rection, and after a course of 510 miles joins the Kur river about 10 mdes from the Caspian Sea, into which it falls above the ba V o Cizil Agach. It is reported that the Aras river, near its mouth, has changed its course, and now flows direct into the bay of Kizil Agach. There are numerous fords on the Upper Aras some only open to men on foot in the summer and early autumn- elsewhere the river is rapid and unfordable. The most import ant crossing is at Julfa, where there is a Russian bridge and ferry worked by wire hawsers from both banks. The stream at this point is about 100 yards wide in winter, with a depth of b feet, and a velocity of 2|- miles per hour. (2) Rivers draining into Lake Urumieh. The A jichai (the bitter river) rises near Ardabil on the south ern slopes of the Savalan Dagh, passes within 3 miles of Tabriz and winding over a bed of sand and gravel, enters Lake Uru mieh, west of Gugan. In the spring it is large and rapid owing to melting snows • later, most of its water is lost in irrigation, and in summer its bed near the lake is frequently dry. The water becomes brack ish in passing through the salt plain, 20 miles north-west of Tabriz, and this increases in intensity on its approach to the lake, owing to the extensive saline marshes through which it flows. Close to the northern gate of Tabriz, a brick bridge of 12 arches and 230 paces in length, crosses one of its tributaries At this bridge the roads to Bayazid and Tiflis separate. It is sometimes frozen over so hard, and covered with snow in winter, as to be indistinguishable from the surrounding country In August it is usually dry. Its total length is 140 miles. The Jaghdtu, or Chaghdtu, rises in the Kuh-i-Chehil Chashmeh in Kurdistan, about 30 miles north of Sinneh. It passes SanoT/ and the Siah Kuh, and falls into Lake Urumieh ' beyond Mianduab. At the last-named place and neighbour-mo- villages, boats are kept for use as ferries when the river is in flood. Here the bed is_ often over j mile broad, but has little depth. In summer it is easily fordable throughout its course, as the bed is wide and gravelly; but in winter it is difficult, though not quite impassable. Water is drawn off it for irrigation purposes. ^ (3) Rivers draining into the Persian Gulf.53 &amp; ftOEfc 80l| isttyj Walut eftelif i nearfe :o tie lay fperlrs 'autonit; t import- dge ami e atreau ieptl oi esoutl- Taln'i reDri- moira; ler its btaet rest of to tie hid it idge of law larate, low ie luatry. 3 , shmei Sarjijil eyoni Uaga Sere lepl .eW quite Tlie Kdrun is the largest and only navigable river in Persia. Its main source is the Sar-i-Chashmeh-i-Kurang, in the west ern spurs of the Kuh-i-Rang, or Jaihun, in the heart of the Bakhtiari country, about 100 miles due^west of Isfahan. At its source it is known locally at the Kurang (short for Kuh-i- Rang). Its course is first south-east for 75 miles, skirting the flat col of Galgushak, which forms a watershed between it and the Zindeh Rud. Owing to numbers of large springs, it becomes almost at once a formidable river fordable only from June to December and then only in its upper reaches. Its banks are deep and steep in places 1,000 to 3,000 feet high for long stretches. Many tributaries join it, the most noteworthy, the Ab-i-Behishtabad, representing the drainage of the Chehar Mahali plateau, at about the 75th mile. It is up to this point bridged in places by stone and wooden structures. At this point the united waters turn south and are quite unfordable onwards, though occa sionally bridges are met with. The country passed through is very wild and broken. At about the 100th mile the river turns west and continues winding through the mountains in a general north-west direction. It finally emerges from the hills through the Tang-i-Kaleh-Dukhtaiun, east of the plain of Ab-i- Bid. Its total length up to here is about 375 miles. Before reaching Shushtar its direction has circled round to southerly. About 600 yards before reaching Shushtar, it divides into two branches. The left branch is called the Ab-i-Gargar, the right first the Karun and afterwards the Ab-i-Shatait. The island enclosed between the two is called the Mianab. The branches re-unite at a point 30 miles due south from Shushtar, or at the 453rd mile of the river's course. The village of Band-i-Qir is situated at the angle of their confluence; here the Ab-i-Diz also joins the Karun and there is a ferry. From thence to Wais, at 465 miles, the river runs south; on to Ahwaz, at 496 miles, it makes many bends and about doubles the distance by the land route, which is only 14 miles. Immediately above Ahwaz the river, now about 600 yards broad, divides into two streams, thereby forming the island of Umm-un-Nakhl. Re-uniting, it breaks through a ridge of sandstone hills and forms a series of rapids, which obstruct the navigation for 1-J miles. At the lower end of these rapids the settlement of Bandar Nasiri has sprung up; and from Karun.54 W to Ahwaz a tramway runs for transferring cargo Continuing, the river makes a series of extraordinary bends' but after a point at the 575th mile of its course, the bends are Jess frequent and slighter. At 607 miles the Bahmanshlr channel SlT Ti - 7 t le f left , b r k aud runs to the Persian i i T llS , f ° rmerly the Mai,i course of the Karun and is still navigable for vessels up to 7 feet draught for 30 miles from its mouth. Its present debouchment into the Shatt-al-Arab is at ) miles, and is there called the Haffar Canal, it was originally a small channel cut for irrigation. From Band-i-Qir to Ahwaz the norma! width of the Karun is 300 yards and, except for sand banks and heaps of stones, navigation is quite easy. The banks vary m height from 10 feet to 30 feet, the land beyond being gravelly plains. Towards Ahwaz they are of marl and the of AwTlr ^ ° nce C uiT d them has ^appeared. The rapids of Ahwaz, though passable by towing, are a serious obstacle even to native boats, especially with a very high or very low river Steamers have twice successfully ascended them under steam. They are about 2,000 yards in length, and 5 in number ; the real obstacle to navigation being the second iiom the top where a reef runs out from the left bank leaving a channel only 100 yards broad, broken up by islets into two or easW^ Tf'’ / , 1 “ ad J oinin g the right bank is the easiest. I he water here rushes with a fall of 1 in 50. At this point a great masonry barrage formerly existed. From Nasm to Muhammareh (120 miles), the river has a normal breadth of i mile, and low banks. The adjoining country is uncultivated plains, deserted in summer, and occupied by Arab encampments in winter.

From Ahwaz to within 7 miles of Shushtar the Karun is navigable for light draught steamers, which can also ascend its tributary, the Ab-i-Diz, to within 14 miles in a direct line from Dizful. There are ferries for crossing the river at Wais, Kut ‘Abdullah and Ghazzavieh, but no bridges below those at Shushtar. No salt water reaches the Karun, though tides arc felt as far up as Ismailieh, and lower down cause a rise and fall of 4 to 5 feet. Date groves begin about 8 miles above Muhammareh. Sharks travel up-stream, when the water is low, to Ahwaz and even Shushtar. The temperature of the Karun is much lower than the Shatt-al-Arab. There are small villages of mud or grass huts every three or four miles up the banks. In its upper reaches in the Bakhtiarl country, owing to the influence of the Khans, it is safe for travel. Lower down, where it approaches the borders of Luristan, there is no security. In the jurisdiction of ’Arabistan, as far down as Wars, matters are slightly better, but much lawlessness prevails and the steamer SJmshan is often obliged to cease running on this account. From Wais downwards the Shaikh of Muhammareh maintains good order. The Persian Government objects to foreign flags beings flown by armed vessels on any part of the Karun.

It is formed by the junction of two considerable streams, one flowing from near Burujird and draining Sllakhur, the other draining upper Faridan and passing Baznui. The former is regarded as the main stream, and forces its way through very rough mountain ous country, from which it emerges, after a course of 120 miles, at a point 47 miles to the northwards of Dizful. It unites with its other main branch (above mentioned) about 20 miles further on. This branch is called the Gand-Ab, and to this point has a tortuous and difficult course of about 160 miles, and Afc-i-Biz.56 Diala. Karkheh. Jarrahi. is generally a rushing torrent. The united streams enter ‘ Arabistan and pass Dizful on the left bank. Here a fine bridge, oilapidated but still passable, spans the river. Below Dizful the bed of the stream is broad and shingly ; the water (lows in several channels, and is largely drawn oft for irrigation. It becomes excessively tortuous and winding before joining the Karun at Band-i-Qir, after a total course of 360 miles. From Band-i-Qlr to Kut Bandar, about 85 miles by water, there is no obstacle to navigation except the strong current. At the latter place there is a reef, but the steamer Shushan once in the spring floods ascended as far as Jisir near Dizful. This river is one of the high roads into the heart of Persia ; the country it traverses is healthy and fertile and in places very well wooded, so much so that the steamers on the Karun draw their supply of w ood fuel from there. J j The T)ldld or Murwan rises in the mountains above Avro- man and runs south-west through Kurdistan and alom' the Turkish frontier as far as Khaniqin, where it turns west and enters Turkish territory and joins the Tigris near Baghdad. It is too rapid and torrential for navigation. The Karkheh owes its origin to a junction of three streams some 30 miles north-north-west of Dizful. From this point it flows south and enters the plains of ‘ Arabistan about 15 miles west of the Ab-i-Diz. It is largely used here for irrigation and lower down, at Nahr Hashim in the Hawlzeh district, was dammed for this purpose. The dam, however, burst in 1837 and the waters, dissipated in streams and marshes, have submerged and ruined the district. The river finafty enters the Shatt-al-Arab, below Qurneh, under the name of the iShwaio. . nc river is formed in the Ramuz district by the junction of the Ramuz river with the Marun. It flows into the Fallahleh district, where it is mostly carried off by canals, the remnants of the stream becoming the Fallahieh-Marid canal Before entering the Jarrahi district it is about 80 yards broad and rapid, with low' banks covered with tamarisk. There are numerous fords, but these are difficult in winter and after rain. The Shatt-al-Arab is the name for the united streams of the Tigris and Euphrates.

At its mouth abreast the Turkish Fort, the Shatt- al-Arab averages 1J miles in width with a low water depth of 12 to 15 feet. The land is very low on both sides of the entrance. The Turkish side is fertile and covered with date trees ; the Persian side comparatively bare and barren for several miles up-stream. From Basrah to Baghdad river steamers ascend the Tigris. Along the southern coast line of Persia from the mouth of Southern Coast the Shatt-al-Arab a number of small rivers enter the sea. line ‘ These are not of sufficient size to use as channels of communica tion, or, except when in flood from rains or melting snow, to be a serious obstacle to the movement of troops at any ’point except adjacent to their mouths. . The most important is the Hindldn or Zaiddn, formed by the Hindian. junction of two streams, one sweet and one bitter, at a point midway between Behbehan and Bandar Dilam. -At first it has a breadth of 70 yards, and a strong current of 3 J miles. There are fords with firm shingly bottoms, but the strength of the stream necessitates care. In spring it is especially deep and strong, and many of the fords are impassable. The lower Hindldn is navigable for native sea-going craft as far as the town of that name and sometimes as far as Kut. It is onlv 8 yards wide at this point, but unfordable. At Deh Mulla some distance up-stream there is a ferrv.

Rival’s drain into the Dasht-i-KavIr, Dasht-i-Lut and other smaller deserts of Persia from all sides, but they are none of them very important. The Ab-i-Qum originates in the Bakhtiar! mountains and flows north-east past Qum into the Daria-i-Namak or Masileh. It is joined near its mouth by the Kara Chai which flows from west to east from near Hamadan. The Kara Chdi is fordable in summer, but not in spring when swollen by rain and melting snow. It is generally 25 to 30 yards wide and 4 to 5 feet deep with a muddy bottom. There is a stone bridge on the Rama dan road, about 3 miles from the town, and a rickety wire sus pension bridge for foot passengers on the road from the town of Taq-i-Bostan. It is also bridged where the old and new Tehran-Qum roads cross it. The Zindeh Rud rises in the Bakhtiari mountains, on the opposite side of the watershed, to the Kdrun river, flows between Isfahan and Julfa, and then loses itself in the marsh of GavKhaneh about 80 miles eastward. It is crossed by 13 bridges, of wdiich 5 are at Isfahan; numbers of irrigation canals draw off its water. The Kur or' Band Amir is a river of Pars, wdiich rises in the Dina mountains, and flows south-east to Lake Niiiz. At about 30 miles north of Shiraz, the road thence to Isfahan crosses this river by the Pul-i-Khan, a bridge with two main arches of irregular size and shape. Here the river runs strongly, though elsewhere slow and deep, about 45 feet broad, with mud banks about 10 feet above the level of the water. It is generally unfordable and the water is fairly good. Eight miles further down is the dam of As’ad-ud-Dauleh, upon which stands abridge of 13 arches 120 yards in length. Prom this band the lower course of the river derives the name Band-i-Annr. Pive more dams divert the waters lower down, the residue reaching lake Nirlz. Above the Pul-i-Khan the river is dam med at the Band-i-Nasirl, some 30 miles up-stream. 5, Rivers draining into the Sistan Hamuns, The Helmand, Kara Rud, Harat Rud and Khash Rud converge and discharge their waters into the Hamun of the59 it-i-Lil g kjaKi® Olffitsiis; or M chiowlni ii isioii .andnel: o5feetfe ntliel» sty fire* ithe toil Id and ns sdns, ai b river, b in the mE at Mi iiich *■ Latel cetoMe h two sr river ® 5{eetl»* : ,f thetf rood. E? upon tf- Froui' Jaud-i-iE the resh- ■iyeris^ Hid niin Sistan, They are all Afghan rivers, but the Helmand, the most important, forms part of the Persian boundary, its waters belong partly to Persia, and it is from it that Sistan is irrigated, It rises near Kabul, and its course is generally south-west through Afghanistan till it finally bends round due north to Sistan, and comes within the sphere of Persian interests. After arriving in Sistan, the Helmand at present divides into three branches, the first, called Rud-i-Sistan, is really a big canal which takes off at the Band-i-Sistan. On it Persian Sistan depends largely for its irrigation. To divert sufficient water into tins channel during the early winter or low river season, a gigantic band or weir is, at this time, constructed across the Helmand, which the rising river gradually carries away about the end of December. The main channel of the Helmand is now the Rud-i-Parian, and the third, the Nad-i-‘Ali, is now smaller, but once was the main channel. The best fords are always at the bars or shallows of the river. Heavy floods, by moving the gravel and boulder in the river bed, completely alter the position of the less important fords, but do not affect the important ones. The Helmand becomes un- fordable for loaded camels, owing to rains, nearly a month before the end of the winter. Towards the end of March, it is usually well in flood and impassable to equestrians, owing to rainfall and melting snow. In dry years the fords are not closed long, if at all. The river rises to its maximum flood level towards the middle or end of April, or at latest early in May, and then slowly but steadily subsides ; the fords then appear in regular and well recognised order and at approximately the same time each year. Horsemen and pedestrians can usually cross some ten days before a ford appears fit for loaded camels. Nowhere on the Helmand are the banks, at crossings of rivers or canals, artificially ramped. There are merely rough slopes worn down by traffic, and it is, therefore, always necessary to arrange for ramping *the roads , to save camels from falls. Rafts, called sal, are used on the Helmand; these are formed of a framework of sticks, preferably willow, placed across gourds or inflated goat skins, and are said to be able to carry three camel loads, and measure 8' by 6' on 12 inflated skins. Similar rafts are also used on the Hamun. Rafts, made of bulrushes, called tutins are maintained as ferries at certain well-known fords. Swimmers cross the river with the help of inflated skins or gourds, and camels are swum with the aid of two inflated skins. The people up the river are very expert at swimming horses.Lakes* Lake Urumleh. ILuiiims. Earia-i-Namak. The only lake of any size in Persia is Lake Urumieh in Azarbaijan. The Persians call it Darla-i-Shahi or royal sea. The lake is 84 miles long by 20 to 30 wide, nearly 300 miles in circumference, and 4,230 feet above the sea. The dimensions vary according to the time of year, but the above are the average. The lake, in spring and at high water, covers about 2,300 square miles, and 1,550 square miles at low water. The salinity is less than that of the Dead Sea. It is extremely shallow and the bed is a series of terraces, so that each change of depth takes place abruptly, not gradually. The maximum depth discovered is 45 feet, but the average depth is not more than 15 to 16 feet; a man can walk 2 miles out from the shore without getting out of his depth. No fish can live in its waters. The banks are covered with a thick treacherous slime, composed partly of salt, partly of decomposed vegetable matter, emitting a horrible effluvium. Sixty islands are clustered together towards the southern end; the largest is 5 miles in length, and three are used for cultivation or pasture. The lake is little used for navigation, though it and its tributary streams are suited for it; but only a few small boats are allowed to ply between the opposite shores. Fourteen rivers of various sizes discharge into the lake, which has no outlet. The remainder of the lakes of Persia of any size are more correctly classed as Hdmuns, the literal meaning of this word being lowlying ground which is liable at limes to become a lake. They have no outlet, and this is compensated for by evaporation; they often exist in the form of salt swamps. Hamuns are found all over the central plateau in places where there are no mountains. Gaud and Zireh possess the same meaning. The most important are— Darld-h-Namah or Masileh, lying north-east and east of Qum. This is a large expanse of salt water, the eastern boundary of which is formed by a continuous sheet of hardest salt rock resembling ice. This in winter is said to be covered with 2 to 3 feet of salt water, but does not dissolve, affording a firm passage and good foothold. The ground adjoining is kavir, or swampy soil with a salty efflorescence, where the roads are not easily distinguishable. Darid-i-Nirlz or Nairlz Bahhtlgdn is in Pars, its most westerly point, when the waters are highest, being 35 miles east L&gt;aria-i-Xiriz,61 JWfffel, 1 It is este leactcki; Ihe be A is noli ontiroi i .cattlfflisl igetaltt are eli® tare, Ufa its trife y smI k Fomteeiii' inooiilt, jsiiews of ft® es to te legated 1*1. ■ampsJE ss ft® it saie a® ,st and® 5 stern ta®' rWssli* redfittdl afimt* is , tiered fjrs, ii* 1 - of Shiraz. Its length is about 60 miles, and breadth 3 to 6 miles. Its waters are derived almost entirely from the river Kur or Band Amir. In dry summers the water entirely eva porates and the inhabitants collect salt from the bed, which . is much esteemed. The shores are soft fine mud, and the water extremely salt. The limits of the lake, at the conclusion of the rainy season, are shown by the line where a light sandy loam covered by a saline deposit begins. In June the water has so far receded that only a narrow streak is visible in the far distance about the centre of the bed, while all the remaining surface is left exposed covered with this deposit, which glitters in the sunshine like snow,- and becomes so soft a short distance from the edge, that it is impossible to walk upon it. The slope of tlie ground towards the centre is so gradual as to be imperceptible. The natives say a little water always remains in the centre, due to perennial streams that flow into it. Lake Nargis, as the northern portion is called, in no way differs from Niriz ; the water only remains in it at its western end. The promontory that juts out between the two is barren, desolate and uninhabited. The Jaz Murldn Hdmun lies between Bampur and J al ilurian. Khanu. As shown on the map the extent is misleading. The entire ground, between Kalanzau on the east and Zch Kalat on the west, is liable to inundation durum the rains. Between these two spots is the actual limit of the swamps, making it some 50 miles by 20. There are said to be two separate swamps called Milan and JIhum. Jaz Murian is a sweet-water lake, in which water remains permanently only between Kalanzau and Gumbaz. In the hot weather the swamp is mostly dried up. Sistan is a deep basin into which the drainage of a threat Hamun-i-Hel tract of country runs. The mountains from which the major maM Sistan ' portion of the water comes are far distant, the intervening country being barren plains. The four largo rivers, which discharge their waters, all flow from Afghanistan. The Sistan basin is surrounded on all sides by high almost vertical scarps, except where the skirts of the Palangan Kuh and Kacha Kuh come down to the shores of the Hdmun. The area liable to inundation at high flood is 2,742 square'miles The actual Hdmun is about 1,474 square miles.62 The area liable to inundations divides itself naturally in to four main basins. (i) The eastern basin, or IIdmun-i-Puzak, with its naizar and flooded lands. (n) The northern basin or Hdmun-i-Sabarl with its naizar and flooded lands. (m) The southern basin, or Hamun-i-Kuh-i-Khwaja wdth its flooded lands and a very limited area of naizar. [tv) Ihe south-eastern basin—or Gaud-i-Zireh, which includes the Sar-i-Shila. The area liable to inundation consists of two characteristic classes viz., the naizar, or reed marsh, and the hamun or lake. The former is the low-lying ground, over which the waters spread themselves on their way to the Mmun to the depth of several feet. This mouth is covered with reeds and bulrushes and broken up by ridges into pools, which are connected by chan nels through which the water from the rivers reaches the hamun. These reed beds connect the various hdmuns, and in flood time nrm one large sheet of water for miles round, extendin 0, towards the south in a semi-circular direction. The hamun is the deepest part of the lake, furthest from the river mouths, which bring down silt. It is seldom crossed, and then only by the most experienced Saiyads 01 Gaudars on their tutins (see Helmand river); but there are many routes across the naizar, which save long and difficult journeys round the hdmun. . Aboufc tliree ^mes in a century the Helmand and other rivers come down m exceptional floods ; Sistan is then a very uncomfortable place. Standing crops and grain stores are destroyed, myriads of insects are bred, and there is much sickness amongst man and beast. Tim rise of water each year commences in the Hataun-i-Piizalc about April, thence the overflow enters the northern and southern basins in succession. The water . e S m ® to fall about July, and in September the low T level is again reached.63 Mialjit iMantti m tii 'Mlm ited star ZM, d kraeteisS sb oik i tte rata the deptM id hi®!) itedljik stketo InWfe 1, estesfe ;e. ki* [{is sel «d Snip at tterts! ad di® 1 and od- is tkn grain ere is a* ; k i entefi ^ pfe # loir !*' r; The central plateau of Persia, exclusive of the mountain Desert*, ranges, largely consists of deserts, and it is to be noticed that the general trend of the deserts corresponds with that of the mountains, viz., north-west to south-east. By far the largest and most important are the Dasht-i- Kavir and the Daslit-i-Lut. The Dashti-i-Kavir occupies the centre of Khorasan. Dasht-i-Kavir. It commences east of Qum, and stretches east to the boundary of Turshlz, fully 400 miles. Its width varies from 80 to 150 miles. It is composed of dark soil, which bears the appearance of having been turned up by a plough and is covered in some places, but not everywhere, with a thick salt efflorescence, which glitters painfully to the eyes. It is absolutely destitute of all sign of vegetation or of animal Ibe. The surface of the havir is not smooth, but honey-combed with small holes about 9 inches deep and the size of n man’s head, which makes it very difficult walking for animals ; but as the soil binds well a good road might possibly be made over it. Its mean altitude above the sea is said to be only about 500—600 feet. Sven Hedin describes the hav~r as a lake in which the natural order of things is reversed ; the bottom has come to the top. The danger of crossing it depends on the rainfall. When rain in any quantity falls, the surface becomes so slippery that camels cannot move on it. When heavy rain comes, the whole Kav'r becomes a sticky quagmire, in which camels and even men sink and cannot move. The only chance for a caravan caught by a heavy rain storm when crossing is to stack the loads, with a view to returning for them later, and make for the nearest shore with all possible speed. The havir by no means occupies the whole extent shewn on the map as the Dasht-i-Kavir; it occupies a large irregular area about the centre, with some outlying portions, and around the edges is sandy desert. The point of departure for caravans from the south is Jandak; the havir to the north of this place is only 68 miles across, cara vans cross here in winter with the utmost speed, in constant fear of being caught by rain. In summer the terrific heat prevents any caravan traffic.64 Dasht-i-Lut. South of Tabas there is a large outlying expanse of Icav'r, which accounts for that oasis being left some miles to the east by the main route between Yazd and Meshed. There is a sheet of water here called the Ab-i-KavIr, which Sven Hedin describes as Tcavlr in the'p rocess °f formation. As the water draining into it brings down more and more silt, and the fierce heat causes evaporation, the Ab-i-Kavxr will gradually be transformed into ordinary Kav'r. Speaking of the Dasht-i-Lut, Sven Hedin gives his opinion that small patches of kavlr may be found in it, but owing to the soil being very sandy, large expanses could never be formed. The rainfall here would also be less and the heat and consequent evaporation would be greater. The Dashl-i-Lut occupies a considerable tract in the south east of Khorasan. Its area may be described as a parallelogram, the angles being marked by the towns Neb, Tabas, Yazd and Kirman. Its least elevated point will be found on a straight line joining Khabis and Neb. It is without doubt the lowest depression of surface in all Khorasan, for the height of its northern boundary varies between 3,000 and 4,000 feet, while its southern limit at Deh-i-Saif is only 1,200 feet; and its lowest point is probably not more than 400 or 500 feet above sea level. Its mean slope is in the direction north- north-east to south-south-west. The term lut is a general term for wastes in this part of the country, but differs from Icavlr, as it may have sand interspersed over its surface, whereas Icavir never has; also the lut desert is generally sprinkled on the borders at any rate, with thorny shrubs, that afford grazing for camels. In a tract called lut there is no water, but the soil is not altogether saline, and therefore does not preclude the formation of hauzes —a very important point. The lut soil consists generally of a greyish coarse grained sand, overlying a sandy bed cemented into a compact mass by a solution of salt. The interior of the desert is absolutely devoid of all signs of animal or vegetable life. Owing to the absence of fresh water, the great heat, and the existence of salt quagmires, these deserts can only be crossed by following the few recognised caravan routes. Being prac tically impassable for troops except in very small bodies, theyform an insurmountable obstacle for the movement of armies across them. In describing the different provinces of Persia they will Desc r i Ptioa of be taken in the following order :—&gt; (i) The north and north-east province, Khorasan. (n) The Caspian Provincas, Azarbaijan, and thensouth- wards as far as Kirmanshah, Isfahan, and Yazd. This and (i) comprise the Russian sphere of influ ence, (in) South-west Persia. This includes the neutral zone of the Anglo-Russian agreement, (iv) South-east Persia. This is the area embracing that portion of Persia south and east of the Bandar Abbas-Kirman-BIrjand-Gazik line, with the exception of Sistan, (v) Sistan. This and (iv) comprise the British sphere. This classification will be used everywhere throughout this Report, since the Gazetteers and Route books are arranged on a similar system. No. I Section.—. Khorasan is the largest province of Persia. Its northern Khorasaa. boundary is the Russian frontier east of the Caspian. To the east it marches with Afghanistan and Sistan, down to the hill of Kuh-i-Malik-Siah. Thence the boundary goes to Nasratabad post, Deh-i-Saif near Kirman, passes Naiband hill, crosses the Dasht-i-Kavir to near Abbasabad and follows roughly the 56th degree of longitude back to the Atrak, The total area is 150,000 to 200,000 square miles, which is essentially mountainous except where bordering on the desert. The soil is very varied. The north-west, north and north east districts enjoying a very rich soil, and being abundantly irrigated, are all extremely productive. Among the mountains the valleys are very fertile. Meshed, Darreh Gaz, Kuchan, Turbat, and Nlshapur represent the most productive districts.66 while Turslm, end the desert countries about the Lut and Ka\ir the reverse. The principal towns are— In the north : Meshed, elevation 3,197 / , the capital, situated about 545 miles east of Tehran, 234 miles north-west of Herat, and 177 miles south-south-east of Askhabad, in a narrow valley, 4 miles to south-west of the Kashaf Rud. Six important routes converge here, and five telegraph lines. Here is the bast and shrine of Reza, the 8th Imam, the precincts of which are rigorously prohibited to any but Muhammadans. Thousands of Shi’ah pilgrims visit this shrine every year, from Central Asia, Afghanistan (chiefly Hazards) and Khorasan and during seasons favourable for travel there are generally about 10,000 present, in winter not more than 1,000. The Belgian Director General of Khorasan Customs, with three Belgian officials and Persian Staff are resident, and merchandise is only allowed to enter the city by three gates appointed by these officers. In 1889 both British and Russian Consuls-general were estab lished here. Meshed has a great trade with Russia, India, Afghanistan and Asia Minor and acts as the distributing centre for the province. Its chief industries are carpet making, shawl and silk weaving, and stone working. Population 70,000 to 80,000. The political importance of Meshed is enhanced by the fact of its being a holy city of the Shi’ah Muhammadans. For terrain, defences, etc., see chapter VII. Kuchan, elevation 4,280', inhabited by a population of about 10,000 Kurds, Turks and Persians. It has been destroyed several times by earthquakes. The surrounding district is most productive and may be termed the granary of Khorasan. (See chapter VII.) Bujnurd, elevation 3,300', is situated in a small plain covered with cultivation, gardens, and trees and surrounded by mountains. It has a population of 10,000, mostly Shadillu Kurds, and is an open town with no walls. There is a post office and Persian telegraph office and the Astarabad-Kuchan road passes through here.Sabzaivar, elevation 3,151', is situated in a district of tho same name, 150 miles east of Shahrud, 65 miles west of Nlslmpur. Population about 15,000. Trade in wool, cotton, silk and dried fruits. It is surrounded by a wall with gates, and has a citadel, all in a ruinous state. A telegraph office exists here. In the east of Khorasan are—• Turbat-i-HaTdarl, elevation ^OQ', 76 miles to the south- south-west of Meshed by the Baidar pass which is closed in winter; the longer route by the Khamari pass is then only possible. Many trade routes meet here. It is surrounded by a dilapidated mud wall affording little protection and has a fine bazar. A British Vice-Consul was established here in 1903, but has since been withdrawn. Head quarters of Russian quarantine cordon was here. The surrounding country is very fertile, with plentiful supplies of grain, livestock and fruits. Sources of income are wool buying, silk production, fruit growing, trade in carpets, grain export and manufacture of copper utensils. Kaln, elevation 4,600', situated 63 miles north of Birjand, was the ancient capital of this district. It has now a popula tion of between 10,000 and 15,000 souls. A ruinous mud wall surrounds it. About 2 miles to the south on a steep hill a re the ruins of a very strong stone fort, a relic of former greatness. The neighbouring country is entirely mountainous, with a number of wild plateaux and fertile valleys &lt;,000—7,000'above the sea; and the people on the whole are a fine race, and good material for soldiers. Birjand, elevation 4,60)',about 240 miles south of Meshed on the northern slopes of a barren, stony valley, has a popula tion of about 25,000 souls. It has a useless and dilapidated citadel. There is a certain amount of trade, and felts, carpets and woollen fabrics are manufactured. (See chapter VII.) To the south-west of Khorasan is—• Tabas, elevation 2,370', 310 miles from Herat and 190 from Yazd, on the road between them. The surrounding coun try is bare and unproductive, except where irrigated, and the grain grown is insufficient for the requirements of the towui. A new town has sprung up outside the walls of tho old one. Inhabitants number between 6,000 and 8,000.68 Astarabad. Shahrud. Mazandaran. There is a Persian post office here. (See chapter VII ; also for Kalat-i-Nadirl, Sarakhs and Pul-i-Khatun.) The province of Astarabad has a population of about 10,000. It is bounded on the north by the Gurgan river, south by the Elburz range and Shahrud district, west by the Caspian Sea and Mazandaran, and east by the district of Jajarm and Armutll plateau. The province is very fertile but undeveloped and has large impenetrable forest tracts. The chief and only city of the province is Astaiabad, with about 12,000 inhabitants which is the residence of a Governor. (See chapter VIII; also for Ashurada and Astarabad Bay.) Shahrud is situated in the Shahrud Bustan district, 205 miles east of Tehran, 258 miles west of Meshed and 43 miles from Astarabad. (See chapter VII for its strategical importance.) No. II Section: The Caspian Provinces, Azarbaijam *Iraq-i-Ajam— The Province of Mazandaran lies on the southern shores of the Caspian; on the east it is bounded by Astarabad, on the west by Gilan and on the south by the Elburz mountains. The area consists of two distinct types:—■ (t) low marshy impenetrable jungle-clad plains : (u) the elevated forest-clad spurs of the northern face of the Elburz. Both are highly impracticable. The coast line is a sandy strip of sand and gravel thrown up by the wash of the surf and lined by a chain of sand hills sometimes 25 to 30 feet high .and 20 yards in breath. Whenever a river manages to force its way through these sand hills it meets the surf, a bar is thrown up and the channel closed. The river w r ater then spreads out for miles behind the sand hills^ and forms a murd-ab (dead water), as in the case of i.nzali. In the rainy season the whole country is under water, in which the large trees stand out, presenting the spectacle of a forest in a swamp. There are numerous villages scattered about.The principal towns are :— Rarl, the ancient capital, situated in a flat plain, on the left bank of the Tilar river. The population is about 8,000. It is a decayed place. Barfurush, the commercial capital, is 26 miles east of Sari, 90 miles north-east of Tehran, 20 miles e^rst of Amul, and 2 miles from the banks of the Bahl, in a flat much cultivated country. Population now estimated at 50,000. Mashad-i-Sar (see chapter VIII). Amul, is situated 22 miles west-south-west of Barfurush on both banks of the Haraz. It is a decaying place. In winter its population is about 40,000, in summer only 20,000, most of the inhabitants migrating to the mountains. A good mule track runs from here to Tehran. Gilan is bounded on the north by the Caspian Sea and Gilan. Russian province of Talish, east by Mazandaran, south by Khamseh and Azarbaijan, and west by Azarbaijan. Its total breadth varies from 20 to 50 miles. Its total length is about 150 miles, and its breadth varies from 20 to 50 miles. It is divided into low unhealthy jungle-clad plains skirting the Caspian, and lofty hills to the south, covered with dense forest and snow-clad in winter. The soil is very rich. It is very similar to Mazandaran above described. Principal towns — Kashi, the capital, is situated on the left bank of the Yud Bud, which flows into the Bay of Enzali about 6|- miles distant. Its population is about 40,000 and likely to increase owing to the prosperity of its trade, (See chapters VII and VIII.) Ldhijan, is 28 miles east of Rasht, on the right bank of the Langar Rud, and is much better situated than Rasht. It is an old town with a population now only about 5,000. The staple commodity is silk, of which much is made in the town and surrounding villages. The province of AzarbaTjan stretches across the north- Azarbaijan, west corner of Persia. Its western boundary is the Zagros70 w*0 range and Turkish frontier, its northern boundary the Rus sian frontier, to the cast arc Talish and (tilan, and to the south Ivhamseh and Kurdistan. Its greatest length is 270 miles frotn east to west and greatest breadth 250 miles from north to south. It is generally mountainous intermingled with fertile valleys, deep ravines, undulating plateaux and »ome mountains of great height. The plain country merely consists of the valleys of the various rivers.

Resident here are British Consul and'a Russian and Turkish Consuls-General and an Armenian Bishop, (See Chapter VII.) Anlabxl, elevation 4,480', situated 100 miles east of Tabriz a Fnnn° miles w ® sfc of ^ Caspian, has a population of about 10,000. Its trade has declined and the town is decayed.A Governor is resident here and there is a telegraph line to Tabriz. Many localities in the neighbourhood, especially the banks of the Kara Su, are fertile and 'well cultivated. Urumich, elevation 4,560', is situated in a fine plain, 112 miles south of Tabriz and 12 miles west of the lake. Popu lation between 50,000 and 40,000, chiefly Afshar Turks but also a number of Nestorians, Jews and Armenians. The surrounding plain is extraordinarily productive. Khol, 3,600', 91 miles from Tabriz and 95J- from Kizil Dizah on the Trebizond road, is a walled and fortified town, but most of the inhabitants live outside. There is a population of 60,000, mostly Turks, but there are also numbers of Armenians. The surrounding district is well cultivated and very productive but dependent on irrigation. Fuel is scarce as the neighbouring hills are treeless. There is an arsenal here. (See Chapter V1T). Mardgheh, elevation 5,312' on the Safichai, 80 miles from Tabriz by the road via Gugan, is a flourishing town with some 80,000 inhabitants. It is situated in a long narrow valley, running nearly north and south at the extremity of a well cultivated plain opening to Lake Urumieh, distant some 9 to 10 miles. The whole place is well watered. The famous marble quarries are 10 to 11 miles distant. Maku, elevation 3,630', on the left bank of the Alsas river, 26 miles on the road from Bayizid to Nakhchivan and distant from the latter place about 46 miles, is situated in a gorge, l to i mile broad with precipitous lofty sides, in the desolate region south of Mount Ararat. The ancient strongholds here of the Chiefs of Maku are now in ruins. Many good roads radiate hence to the Russian and Turkish frontiers and two of these are suitable for carriages. There are about 400 houses in the modern town. It is the residence of Timur Pasha Khan, the hereditary chief of the semi-independent Kurdish clan of the district. SdUj Luldgh, elevation 4,410', the local capital of the Kurds of Azarbaijan, is situated on the caravan route between Tabriz and the Sulaimanieh passes. Population is about 15,000, mostly Kurds, with a few Armenians. Water is plentiful, but fuel scarce. It is difficult of access in winter.72 Kurdistan. Kurdistan has no natural or political boundaries ; it in cludes both Turkish and Kurdish territory, and contains many other elements besides Kurds. It roughly extends from Turkish Armenia on the north, to the plains of the mid dle Tigris and Luristan mountains on the south ; and through out the greater part of this length overlaps Turkish territory. Persian Kurdistan is bounded on the north by Azarbaij in, on the west by Sulaimanieh and other Turkish territory, on the south by Kirmanshah, and on the east by Hamadan and Khamseh. The population with the exception of the inhab itants of Sinneh, are hill people and nomads. All the latter are Sunnis and number about 30,000. There is a good amount of cultivation, especially tobacco. The former small province of Ardalan is now included in it. The total population is re ported at 270,500. Chief towns are :— Sinneh or Senna, elevation 5,037', the capital, is situated 200 miles south-south-east of Tabriz, and 80 miles north west of Hamadan, and 87 miles north of Kirmanshah. It is a very old town, and around it is an open cultivated valley with orchards and gardens. Water is abundant, a canal run ning through the town. Hills surround it on all sides. The population is 32,000, including some hundreds of Jews and Armenians, who are here well treated. It is the seat of govern ment of the province. There are post and telegraph offices, military barracks, an arsenal, and a Turkish consul. The better class of people wear Persian dress. The exports are carpets, wool, skins of fox, marten and otter, tobacco and grain. It is abundantly supplied with everything and the centre of several routes. Bdneh, elevation 5,400', is situated on the bank of a tribu tary of the river Kalvi with a deep ravine on the other side. The town is prosperous and has 600 houses; it is the residence of the chief of the Baneh Kurds. A gun-smith here makes ser viceable rifles. Saqqiz, elevation 5,140', is a town of some 2,000 houses on the road to Tabriz from Sinneh. The people are nearly all Kurds, very hospitable and fairly civilised. There are some clever gun-smiths here. Carpets and felt are manufactured and tobacco very largely exported.The province of Kirm'lnshah is bounded on the north by Kinuaashali, the mountains of Kurdistan, east by Kangavar and As’adabad, south by Luristan-i-Kuchak, and west by the vilayet of Bagh dad, It was originally prosperous and flourishing, but ow ing to a series of rapacious governors, followed by years of drought and disease, it was reduced to a low ebb, but has now fairly recovered. It is important politically, strategically, and commercially. Commercially, as it is the gateway by which all British trade viA Baghdad enters Persia, in fact it is the only way for heavy merchandise, as there are no bad k idols to pass, as in the case of the southern routes. The population, outside the town, consists of Kurds, both nomad and sedentary. It is a very fine grain-producing area and celebrated for horses and mules. (See Chapter VII.) The town of Kirmdnshdh, elevation 4,8(10', is the capital. It is situated about 250 miles south-west of Tehran, 262 miles west-north-west of Isfahan, and 220 miles north-east of Bagh dad on two small hills, in a large valley 30 miles long by about 10 wide, watered by a stream. Large quantities of supplies are procurable. It is the seat of government of the province, and an excellent centre for mule b yimr; The population is now estimated at 80,000. _ A large number of these are engaged in agriculture, but there is an enormous trade in wool and skins, obtained from the flocks of the nomads. Gum, opium and dried fruits are also exported. The imports, with the excep tion of sugar, are all British or Indian. (See Chapter VII.) The district of Garus lies between the districts of Khamseh Gams, and Kurdistan and the provinces of Azarbaijan and Kirman- shah. It is one of the hereditary chiefships of western Persia. The surface is broken into wide level plateaux, culminating at one central point in rocky elevations, and round the edges falling abruptly into a labyrinth of ravines. -Valleys and ravines are well watered and fertile; the plateaux are barren in appearance, but with good soil, and are most productive in wheat and barley after seasonable rain. The rocky elevations and uncultivated plateaux also afford good grazing. Popula tion 80,000 to 85,000 Kurds, Turks and Persians in equal pro portions.74 Iraq-i-AJam. Tehran. The chief town is Bijar, 3,000 houses, curiously situated in a hollow surrounded by barren peaks. The inhabitants are mainly engaged in agriculture, but a few carpets are manufactured. The district is noted for its large flocks of sheep. Fuel is very scarce, the country being bare of trees, but the pasture lands are excellent and most extensive, Traq-i-Ajam as the name of a province is quite obsolete. It used to be bounded on the north by Azarbavjan and Gilan, east by the central desert, south by Kirman, Ears and Khuzistan and west by Traq-i-Arab and Kurdistan. Among other outlying areas it comprised the districts, now known as Isfahan, Tehran, Khamseh, Kazvin, Qum and Kashan, the Bakhtiari country, Luristan, Hamadan and Yazd. It thus practically included nearly the whole of the great central plateau, and is a very convenient geographical area for the purposes of description. The appearance of this plateau is almost everywhere the same, being mountainous with valleys of an indefinite length, but seldom exceeding 10 to 15 miles in breadth. The mountains are barren and devoid of timber, and either gradually sink into the desert, or throw branches into the prov inces of Kirman and Khorasan. 'The valleys are generally uncultivated, but have good soil. Between the mountain ranges are to be found plains of small extent. The only large forests are in the neighbourhood of Pusht-i-Kuh and Khurramabad ; the remainder of this area is, like the rest of southern Persia, ill-provided with timber. The principal districts, cities and towns are :— Tehran., elevation 3,865', the capital of Persia, is situated in the stony plain at the southern foot of the main Elburz range. It has now an enciente, on a European plan, of 11 miles with 12 very ornate gateways. Inside it is a curious mixture of ori ental and western ideas; metalled and watered roads, tramways and gasworks with the usual Persian mud hovels alongside. In the northern part of the new town is the Tup Maidan, the principal public place, so called from the artillery barracks and park of obsolete guns there. Besides this are the Maidan-i-Mashq, and the Maidan-i-Shah or parade, outside the Ministry of War, with a large tank and a colossal semi-sacred brass gun.From the Tup Maidan two streets, or avenues, planted with poplars run in a northerly direction, of these the more westerly, the Khxaban-i-‘Ala-ud-19aulch, contains the residences of representatives of several foreign Powers, including the British Legation, which is the most imposing and spacious of them all. The ark or citadel covers a space nearly a quarter of a mile square, on the southern side of the Tup Maidan. It is now merely a collection of gardens, courts and buildings belonging to the Royal Palace, and contains the Talar or throne room, the state apartments, the Shah’s library and museum. In the last named are kept the crown jewels, and the Peacock throne. Mosques are few in number, the finest is the Masjid-i-Sipah- salar. The bazaars are large and vaulted, open frequently into small squares, and have a number of well built caravanserais. The population numbers about 280,000, of whom 5,000 are Jews and 3,000 Armenians. Of Europeans, excluding all offi cials, it is estimated there are some 500, speculators, small traders, etc. Turkey has an ambassador here. Great Britain, Russia, France, Germany, Austro-Hungary, Belgium, Holland, Spain, Italy and the United States have an Envoy Extra ordinary Minister Plenipotentiary. Outside the city walls are several palaces and other country residences, mostly situated on the hill slope known as Shimran a cultivated belt extending for about 20 miles along the base oi the Elburz range. Here also foreign legations have summer residences ; some fixed, as the British at Gulhak, the Russians at Zargandeh, and the Turks and Germans in Tajrish; others rented yearly. Samndn, elevation 4,000', is situated about 120 miles east of Tehran, and about the same distance from Shahrud, and has a population of about 25,000. It is a walled town with four gates, clean well-filled bazaars and a flourishing trade. The water- supply is plentiful from large reservoirs outside, and gardens and fine trees are numerous. The surrounding district is bare and very thinly populated. Water is scarce and not enough grain is produced for the wants of the inhabitants. The Governor resides in the town. Kazvin, elevation 4,034', is 90 miles west-north-west of Tehran at the foot of the mountains on the road to Rasht, at76 the extremity of a fi le plain, and is surrounded by gardens and vineyards. It is in a ruinous state and subject to earthquakes. Water is very scarce. Trade with Giian is considerable and the place seems reviving. Swords and arms are manufactured here. The population is estimated at 40,000, chiefly descended from Turkish tribes. Zinjan, elevation 5,546', is the capital of Khamseh province and the residence of a Governor. It lies 135 miles north of Hamadan on the road to Tabriz and is the centre of a productive district. The town is built on high ground and surrounded by beautiful gardens. Skilful workmen are to be found here, who manufacture arms and ammunition. The bazaar is very large and roofed in as a protection against snow. The exports are hides and shoes. It is noted as the headquarters of B.ibism, and the scene of the stubborn fight and massacre of Babis. Hamad m, elevation 6,280', situated at the foot of Mount Al- vand some 180 miles south-west of Tehran. It is the ancient Ecbatana, and the reputed tombs of Esther and Mordecai are here. Dense woods and cultivation surround it, and it lies on the edge of a fertile plain, producing much wheat and barley. The population are of three classes, military, religious and mixed. The first named and most numerous class cqnsist of the brave and warlike tribe of Kara Gazlu, of whom there are 4,000 houses. The second is composed of an infinity of Sai /ids and Mullas. The third and smallest consists of merchants, tradesmen, workmen and agriculturists. Total population is estimated at 50,000, about J Turks, 5,000 Jews, 250 Armenians and the remainder Persians. The main industry is leather manufacture, the tanneries being the best in Persia. (See Chapter VII.) Qum, elevation, 3,200', is the capital of a province of the same name, 87 miles from Tehran by the old road, 93| by the new one vii ’Allabad. It lies on the right bank of the Anirblr in the middle of an extensive plain. Population about 20,000, of whom fully | are priests, Saiyids and their families. It is a very sacred place ; over 400 Imamzadehs are said to be located here, and numbers of piPrpns visit them annually. The chief shrine is that of Fatimeh, sister of Imam Reza i the gildeddome of her tomb is a conspicuous landmark, and the spot is a celebrated sanctuary. The whole of the ground outside the town presents the appearance of one vast burial ground. The (own itself is in a ruinous condition, and the bazaars poor, but carrying on a brisk trade with pilgrims. A good masonry bridge crosses the river, which is unfordable in April, but dries up altogether two months later. The surrounding country produces abundant grain and cotton, the latter being exported to Russia, Kdshan, elevation 3.260', is situated 128 miles south of Tehran, and 111 miles north of Isfahan, in a stony piain,.on the edge of the great salt desert extending to the north. Its condition is dilapidated, and the probable population some 30,000 inhabitants; these are celebrated for their commercial and industrial aptitude, and also for their cowardice. Brass, copper, silk and velvet work are excellent here. A tall leaning minaret is a landmark for miles. Wood is very scarce, Burujird, elevation, 5,420'. Situated in a district of the same name, which is now incorporated in Luristan. The dis trict is noted for its pastures, breed of horses and the quanti ties of opium grown. The town is in ruins in places, but has a population of about 22,000 souls. It is important as a dis tributing centre for trade, roads radiating in every direction. If the Shushtar road were developed and peaceful conditions prevailed, Burujird would develop into a large and important town.- The country around is productive, the water-supply good, and the town completely surrounded by gardens. Gulp'ngm, elevation 6,090', is 114 miles from Isfahan on the road to Hamadan. A straggling, dirty town in a ruined con dition ; with a population of 20,000 it is’ really nothing but an agricultural centre. The Qum river is 150' to 200'wide here, with rapid current and high clay banks, and. is spanned by a masonry bridge, Isfahan, elevation 5,300', the capital of a province of that name, is situated on the left bank of the Zindeh End. The suburb of Julfa is 4 miles off on the right bank of the same river. The city is a large emporium of trade.78 Xazd. It hag 14 gates, but no wall; the streets are narrow and dirty and at least a quarter of the city is in ruins. Bazaars are very extensive and covered in. The'present population is computed at 80,000, rather more than less. The Maidan-i- Shah or royal square, most imposing in appearance and mea suring 600 paces by 200, is now very deserted, and only used as a parade ground. The Madraseh-i-Shah Sultan Husain is the finest building now left in the city. Industries are the manu facture of woven fabrics, ornamental trinkets, guns, pistols, sword blades and silk and woollen carpets. Imports are tea, sugar and piece goods. (See chapter VII.) Yazd, elevation 4,075', capital of the district of the same name, lies 200 miles south-east of Isfahan, and some 220 miles north-west of Kirman. Its chief characteristics are the number of wind towers - “ badglr,” and water reservoirs “ The streets are,'narrow, dirty, unpaved and half filled with sand. Houses have often twu) underground stories. Great plains ex tend to the north and south, but gardens for at least a mile from the city are gradually dominating the! sand. The old town, in which is the ark or citadel, the residence of the Governor, has walls, bastions and a ditch. The ark, too, is veil fortified and calculated to resist the attack of a mob. The main bazaar is fairly well built and lighted; the side ones are dark and dirty. The population is put at 60,000, and among these the Parsis form an important community ; about 1,000 live in the city, and 6,000 more in villages outside. The streets in their quarter are wider, cleaner and more sanitary, and their houses better than in the rest of the city. There are about 1,000 Jews ; these have a hard life. A few native Indians engaged in trade live here, and a small European community exists, including five missionaries. The feeling against them has died away and they are now not only respected but liked. Yazd is commercially the most important point on the caravan route of 1,000 miles between Bandar ‘Abbas and Meshed. It is a great receiving and forwmrding depot for goods, to this it mostly owes its wealth and importance. Opium is its most important export, and weaving the chief industry. The great hindrance to a development of trade is want of trans-79 ■e uttnn^ pd|llllli;i Tkelii ®{ 8||ir, riojljiai! Htsaii® ire liit.

Roads radiate in every direction to other important cities. The Persian telegraph line is indifferently maintained. The entire crops of the province, in a good year, only suffice to supply the city for three months. Section III—The Neutral Zone, Luristan and the Bakhtiari country, although forming part of the geographical area, Traq-i-Ajam, above described, belong also to Section III, the Neutral zone, under the system on which this report is arranged throughout. Luristan has for one of its western boundaries the Turkish Parisian. Empire, and shares with Ardalan the distinction of being the most mountainous province of Persia. It includes geographi cally the region of the Pusht-i-Kuh. To the north it has the province of Kirmanshah, to the east the district of Faridan and the Bakhtiari country ; on the south, also, the Bakhtiari country and northern ‘Arabistan ; to the west the Turkish boundary is not properly demarcated. To the south-west, on the lower slopes of the mountains, are found the principal grazing grounds. Plains of any extent are few. Luristan is very well wooded, but the inhabitants cut down timber remorselessly. Khurramdbad, elevation 4,050', is the only place that has any pretensions to be called a town. It is the residence of the Governor, has a fixed population of something under 2,000, and is situated in the Pish Kuh district, commanding the passes used by the nomads in their annual migrations! Thus placed a certain amount of control can be had over the tribes, and a military camp is established at the foot of the passes every year for this purpose, and to protect the town. Most of the requirements of the inhabitants are obtained from Burujird, the state of the country towards Diziul beiim too disturbed for caravans to enter from that side. (See chapter VII.) In this district there are few villages, and practically no settled population. The BakhtiarT country lies on the eastern and south-eastern boundaries of Luristan, the borders so merging as to be not Country, clearly definable. To its north is Earldan, north-east Isfahan east the QSshqai country, and south Behbehan, and Arabistan! /&lt;/&gt;80 Thd whole district is divided into three sections, both for geographical and revenue purposes :—■ (i) Chehdr Mahal, the extensive plateau at its northern and north-eastern boundary. {ii) Pusht-i-Kuh, the mountainous country between the Chehar Mahal and southern and western plains. {in) Those plain and other lands merging with the province of ‘Arabistan, The Bakhtiari country is essentially mountainous, as described under the heading “ Mountains ”. Besides the im portant ranges, numerous shorter ones score the surface of the country, and distort it from any semblance of regularity. The Chehar Mahal plateau is roughly 40 miles deep and 60 broad, with an elevation of 7,000'. Where level it is arable and pasture land and well watered ; but everywhere destitute of trees and shrubs. Pasture abounds in other places, notably the Tuleh and Ma-lamir plains, and also in summer and autumn in the higher valleys. The country is comparatively well timbered, but the inhabitants are rapidly consuming the supply. Streams and rivers are numerous, as already described. Among the moun tains, lakes are often met with. There are no towns. (See Chapter VII.) Northern ‘Arabistan consists of the alluvial plains of the rivers Karun, Diz and Kharkeh, immediately below the moun tains. To the west lies the vaguely defined Turkish frontier, and to the south, Southern ‘Arabistan. The country is flat and entirely outside the mountain system, but has a few small ranges of hills across it The inhabitants are of a mixed type, but Arabs predomi nate. In the cold season many Bur's and Bakhtian come down from the mountains. The people of Shustar arid Dizful are supposed to be descendants of the Assyrians, now almost en tirely Persianised. The chief towns are— hhushiar, elevation 410', the capital of the province, and residence of the Persian Governor Cieneral, is situated in the81 e fta tainoiu ) tie ii ace ell itj, epanji' rabies: stitatei iilel ii e # isito &amp; ae k m |i nsofi aeai® ffoatb ■j is S prste uaek tf ® most® nce,JE difiS angle formed by the division of the Karun river into two branches. The houses are old and in bad repair, and parts of the town are in ruins. The population is said to be 20,000, but declining. Shushtar is the river port of Dizful, through which all its imports and exports pass. A number of local industries are carried on. (See Chapter VII.) Dizful, elevation 660', is situated on the left bank of the Ab-i-DIz on elevated uneven ground. The houses are closely packed, and the streets narrow, crooked and filthily dirty. The population is 45,000 or so, and increasing; of these some 6,000 are Saiyids. Post, telegraph, and customs offices are located here. The surrounding country is remarkable for its beautiful herbage in the spring—a great contrast to the remainder of the province. (See Chapter VII.) Southern ’ Arabistan is the alluvial district between the head Southern of the Persian Gulf, and the northern province of the same Arabi3fcan - name. _ Its boundaries with Turkey and to the east are only approximately defined. There is, however, one point fixed on the left bank of the Shatt-al-Arab, about 1 mile above the village of Hadd, and opposite the Turkish island of Tawaileh. From this point to the Persian Gulf the boundary with Turkey is the Shatt-al-Arab. With the exception of the range of hills through which the Karun forces a passage at Ahwaz, the whole country is flat. The level open plains are mostly barren, and thinly sprinkled with desert scrub, though some portions are grassy and cultivated in patches in spring-time. To the east the Fallahleh and Ma’shur districts become salt swamps in winter, and to the w^est there-is a similar swamp about Hawlzeh. There are date trees along the coast line, Shatt-al-Arab and the last 20 miles of the Karun; otherwise there are no trees, except willows, etc., fringing the river banks. Nearly all the inhabitants are Arabs, and only nominally under the Persian Governor-General at Shushtar, the practical ruler being the Shaikh of Muhammareh, who is virtually independent. Muhammareh, the capital and only important town, stands on the right bank of the Haffar Canal. The houses begin about 1J miles above the confluence of the canal with the Shatt- al-Arab. The banks within the limits of the town are protect ed by revetments of date logs laid horizontally, and forming82 Fars. Shiraz. quays and wharves. It is shut in by date groves, beyond which an open treeless desert stretches away into the interior. The town is increasing, and at present contains over 800 houses. Kut-ush-Shaikh on Abbadan island is practically a suburb. The inhabitants are estimated to number 6,000 chiefly local Arabs of the Muhaisin tribe. (See Chapters VII and VIII, where Ahwdz and Bander Nasiri are also dealt'tvith.) The province of Fars in name, history and population has the best right to be regarded as Persia proper. To the north lies the province of Isfahan, north-east Yazd, east Kirman, south-east Laristan, south-west the coast of the Persian Gulf from Tahiri to the north of Bandar Dilam ; while to the west it is bounded by ’Arabistan and theKuhgalu and Bakhtian countries. It may be divided physically and climatically into two divisions, the garmsir and the sards r. The former includes the tract that runs parallel to the shores of the Persian Gulf, and Dashti (or plain land at the foot of the mountains). The latter wnich begins about the latitude of Kazarun includes most of the mountainous region. This province is divided into 22 districts of which the most important are Behbehan, Kazarun, Abadeh, Dehbld, Firuzabad, Arsinjan and Abr Quh. Near the shores of the Gulf the mountains are bare and rocky, and the country is very sparsely populated, though numerous ruins show signs of a former prosperity, where now there is nothing but desert. There are no trees, and only a few scattered thorn bushes in places. Every village, however small, has a patch of cultivation around it, the intervening country being desert. Between Behbehan and Shiraz, there are upwards of 60 miles of beautiful country covered with woods and verdure, but uninhabited except by a few lawless tribesmen, to whose depredations this state of things is due. The following are the principal towns:—• Shiraz the capital, elevation 5,200', by post road 326 miles south-south-east of Isfahan and 182 miles north-east of Bushire, is situated on the right bank of a stream, in a fertile well-wateredplain about 7 miles wide, surrounded by mountains. Fine gardens and vineyards are in its vicinity. The stream, which sometimes has a certain volume of water from December to April, is usually dry for the rest of the year, the water being used for irrigation purposes. It empties itself into the salt lake about 12 miles to the south-east of Shiraz. Five miles south of Shiraz, the valley is separated from an extensive marsh by a low range of hills. The city is irregularly circular in shape, and surrounded by a wall, flanked by semi-circular towers rising some feet above the parapet; the whole is bounded by a dry ditch and is in such a bad state of repair that it is possible to ride through the gaps. The circumference of the town is about 4 miles, but more than half the enclosed area is taken up with maiddns, bazars, and public buildings. There are six gates. The population cannot be less than 60,000 ; of these there are nearly 7,000 Jews. The Shirazis are of less mixed Iranian type than found elsewhere. The British Political Resident in the Persian Gulf sometimes spends some of the summer months here and a consul resides permanently. About half a mile outside and north- west of the city is a garden where the staff of the Indo-European Telegraph Company live. A chief branch of the Imperial Bank of Persia is established in the city. Communications radiate in every direction, but only by caravan, except to Isfahan? to which there is a carriage road. The tomb of the celebrated poet Hafiz is f a mile outside the city. Among the local manu factures are rough carpets, namad (felt), tents and curtains, small arms, swords, daggers and cutlery, and foot wear. The local wine is celebrated. Behbehdn, elevation 1,300', capital of an administrative division of the same name, is situated 140 miles west-north-west o: Shiraz and 43 miles north-north-east of Bandar Dilam, in an extensive plain, three miles from the Marun river. The town is 3£ miles in circumference, and has high mud walls and a ditch, in the south-east corner is a fort. It is a place of no great strength, and its interior is small and confined; there are a few rusty cannon, and it might resist an attack of undisciplined troops. The town is mostly in ruins and the streets very filthy. Probable population from 6,000 to 8,000. These are divided into two factions : the Behbehanis a mixture of Persians and Arabs and the Qanawatls about twice as numerous, who are of Turkish origin.84 taristan. Behbehan is important as a concentrating and distributing centre for caravan trade. The chief export is wheat The water-supply is meagre and bad. but might easily be improved Ihe surrounding plain provides excellent j asturage. Aim, 5,684', is situated 131 miles west by south of Shiraz and 7 miles from south-east point of lake Niriz, in an angle formed by two chains of hills. It is a scattered town surrounded y proves and gardens. The population must be quite 10.000 chiefly Persians, and quite distinct from the tribes dwelling on me shores m the lakes. The surrounding plain is laigely cultivated with corn and opium. A Deputy Governor resides iiere. JaJinm, elevation 3,080', 72| miles by road east-south- east of Firuzabad, is situated in an extensive plain under the northern slope of'Kuh-i-Bafreh, a rocky mountain extending east and west. The walls are about 3 miles in circumference but dilapidated; there are more houses outside than within them. Many houses possess turretted towers as places of defence r lhe number of date plantations makes the town appear larger than it really is. t l The population is estimated at about 10,000. The surround ing country is principally irrigated with water drawn from wells by bullocks. Jahrum is a mart for tobacco, but the trade is depressed. (For Bushire, Kazarun, Firuzabad Fasa see Chapters VII and VIII.) ’ “ ’ The Province of Laristan extends along the coast of the Persian Gulf opposite to the Pirate coast. To the north-' west and north it has Pars, to the north-east Kirman, to the east Shamil, and on the south the Gulf. The surface is diversified with plains and mountains ; the latter seldom attain an elevation exceeding 6,000 feet. Mountains rise along the whole extent of the coast giving it a bold appearance, whilst the peaks serve as landmarks to navigators. The province is sparsely populated by Arabs and Persians, the maritime population belonging to the former, and the agriculturists chiefly to the latter. In addition there are a 'number of predatory, lawless, nomad Arabs. A considerable proportion of the inhabitants are Sunnis.

It is an unwalled city covering about £ a square mile and is dominated by two steep limestone hills some 400 feet above it. The population seems to be about 8,000. The town is only important as a centre of trade and a halting place for large caravans. (For Lingeh see Chapter VIII.) Section IV—The British sphere of influence. The Province of Kirman is bounded on the east by parts Kirm*n. of SIstan and Baluchistan, on the west by the province of Pars, on the south by parts of Laristan and Persian Makran and the coast of the Persian Gulf, and on the north by Khorasan. It is a very mountainous province, some peaks attain an elevation of over 14,000'. Rivers are unimportant. In the desert, west, south and east of Khman, water for the villages has to be conveyed from the hills for many miles by means of qandls. Narmashir is less arid than other parts of the province, but even there the desert is encroaching. Few ranges are now covered at all extensively with timber ; the forests are gradually disappearing, being exhausted by charcoal burners, which probably accounts for the diminishing rainfall. The garmslr , is the belt of country between the great mountain ranges and the sea, and is here composed of saline sand. It stretches inland across the plains of Rudbar and Jiruft. The date palm flourishes in these parts- Part of the Lut desert lies within the limits of Kirman. Though impassable for anything but the smallest body of troops, it is feasible for caravans, and there is more water than was supposed. The total population is estimated at 1,000,000. The com munications are inaj backward state, only fit for pack transport, and very unsafe ow ng to robbers. The principal towns are :—• Kirmdn, elevation 5,680', the capital of the province, is main ly surrounded by deserts absolutely devoid even of bushes ; but86 Boeha&amp;ard. being at the junction of many roads the town is important as a trade centre. For water it is dependent on qandts, though everv house has a well. Kirman is 8 miles from a range of any size and further off to south, east and north mountains attain elevations of from 10,000' to nearly 13,000'. Half a mile to the east is a limestone crag, rising about 500' above the plain level, on which are two forts. In the plain ruins are numerous. The city is surrounded by clay walls and has six gates. Ihe population is taken at 50,000, among whom Parsis number 1,700, and there were 20 Hindu traders 1 here are a post office, an English mission station, and a branch of the Imperial Bank of Persia located here.' The town is celebrated for its beautiful carpets. (See Chapter Saiddbad elevation 5,490', is a busy, prosperous place and contains about 9,000 inhabitants. It is encircled by a hi&lt;ffi wall and is situated near the southern end of the great kavir in a lertile plain studded with magnificent trees.

Bashakard is a mountainous and savage district of south east Persia, now included iu the province of Kirman It T, the most primitive and backward district in Persia, au^probablyalso the poorest. The country consists of one main ruwed range running east and west, which serves as a watershed between the Jaz Murian Hamun and the Gulf of Oman. North of this range is open plain to the Hamun, while to the south is a labyrinth of rugged inaccessible hills, intersected by great rocky watercourses, along which run the barely practicable tracks, which afford the only means of communication. These are sometimes quite impassable, owing to great boulders and ridges o. up tilted strata forming very high perpendicular scarps. . The hiI1 alo P es be ar stunted vegetation, and the level ground is wooded sparsely with trees of various thorny kinds The all-pervading plant of the district is the dwarf palm, the leaves of which serve many useful purposes. The 'best feature of Bashakard is the abundance of water, almost in variably good, and running streams, so different from the rest of Persia. Owing to the miserable degraded class of the inhabitants and the absolute lawlessness of this remote region this magniilcent supply of water is allowed to run to waste entirely unused for the purposes of irrigation. Persian Baluchistan is a huge tract of thinly populated BdluchiiUn. country, lying along the eastern borders of Persia co-terminous with British territory. From Gwatar on the south to Kuh-i- Malik Siah on the north this province is roughly 350 miles, and fu^m Kuhak on the east to near Kalanzau on the west about 250 miles. Its southern boundary is the coast line from the mouth of the Karvan river to a point in Gwatar bay. Baluchis tan is a very mountainous country, with ranges rising up to 13,000'. Leaving the coast, the country is for the first 20 to 30 miles somewhat flat with small hills, till the Lashar range is reached. Bampur is in a valley and to the north rise the highlands of Sarhad where the ranges trend from north to south with the lowlying Kirman desert to the west and British Baluchistan to the east. The rivers have no volume of water except after heavy rain; they are otherwise fordable almost anywhere and in hot weather nearly dry up. The province is divided into four administrative districts with very vaguely defined boundaries. These are (*) (*) Persian Makran, embracing all the lowlying region from the coast to the watershed of the LftshSr mountains.88 (tt) BarapCr north of the L5sh5r range with Kirman on its west. (tit) Saravan or Dizak to the east of Bampur and bordering British territory. (tv) Sarhad to the north, with British Baluchistan on its east. The population has been roughly estimated at a maximum of 140,000, furnishing some 11,000 fighting men. In Sarhad there are said to be about 40,000 people mostly nomads. The principal towns are:— Bampur, elevation 1,906', a small decayed place, no longer the capital of the district since Pehiird or Fehruj, where now the Governor and most of the troops reside, rose in importance. It is now noteworthy only because many routes converge here. (See Chapter VII.) Fthruj or Fohreh or Pehurd, about 151 miles east of Bampur, is the present capital of the district, and owes its existence to the new fort built there in 1892. It has now a population of 12,000 to 15,000, not including the garrison. (See Chapter VII.) Qasrqand, elevation 1,770', a large village in Makran with a fort and population of 1,800, mostly Baluchis. Around are extensive date groves and cultivation. It is well supplied with water, fuel and grazing and routes radiate in various directions. Gth, elevation 1,504', is a large and important village, 115 miles from Bampur, 85| miles from Chahbar and the first place after leaving the coast that is sufficiently fertile and ■well watered to supply anything. It consists of some 500 houses. A fort here stands on a rocky cliff, but is more or less in ruins. (For Chahbar and Gwatar see Chapter VIII) Bint, elevation 1,400', a large village and sub-district in Makran, is situated on the Bint or Fanuch river about 45 miles west of GO ft. The district is hilly, traversed by several streams and on the whole fertile. The village is in the centreof date groves and overlooked by a square mud fort on a high steep hill, round which cluster some 70 strongly constructed houses. The streets are steep, narrow and very filthy, conse quently the place is unhealthy. The population are mostly Baluchis, with a certain number of slaves, and are said to number 2,000. They are supported mainly by their dates. Camels are numerous and big but not enduring. Religion is of great importance here, as in other villages ol this region, except among the nomadic part of the population. The mullas represent themselves as Sunnis, but are in reality Sufis. The Bint river is one of importance in Makran. 'the district known as Sistan includes all the varied and extensive region drained by the Helmand and other rivers, which converge and discharge their waters into the Hamun, which is the most characteristic feature of the country. Of this area 2,847 miles are Persian and 4,159 Afghan. The name Sistan, as applied to the whole country comprising both Persian and Afghan Sistan, is no longer ever locally used in that general sense. To the Afghan, Sistan means the inhabited portion of Persian Sistan only. Afghan Sistan is known only as Chakansur and Kala-i-Fath, the names of its two districts. The name Sistan is restricted by Persians to the area irrigated and cultivated by the Rud-i-Sistan, or even further to the capital town Shahr-i-Nasirieh (Nasralabad) called locally Shahr-i-Sisidn, other portions being known by separate names. The Helmund, Farah Rud, Harat Rud and Khash Rud converge and pour their waters into Sistan, creating, in time of flood, the great lake filling the Hamun area, and forming for some hundred miles the boundary of Sistan on the north and west. Owing to constant changes of course of the Helmand, the delta is made up of three distinct component deltas, each of which has at one time or another received the water of the river. The first comprises the southern portion of Sistan, which, having been deserted for centuries by the river, has become a desolate uninhabited country instead of a rich populous one. The second delta forms the eastern portion of -Sistani and90 owing to the deflection of the river has similarly become an uninhabited waterless desert. The third delta comprises all the inhabited region of Persian and Afghan STstan, and is watered by the Helmand and its three distributary channels. Interspersed between these three deltas are plateaux ol gravel- covered plains, probably never irrigated at any time. 'J he southern portion of STstan, except where lie great expanses of open land once watered by the Helrnand, and now a desert studded with ruins, consists of gravel-covered plains rising in terraces and abounding in deep depressions. This is a waterless dismal tract, destitute of all vegetation. In the west, mountains stretch 'from Saindak in the south to Bandan in the north. Proceeding northward, the plain ends abruptly in a line of cliffs (30' to 150' high), which, begin ning on the Helmand opposite Kuhak, fringe the south of in habited STstan to near Hauzdar. From below these cliffs, cultivated inhabited STstan begins, and presents an appearance of dead uninteresting flatness. The Kuh-i-Khwaja, an iso lated table-topped hill of black volcanic rock, 450' high, which stands up as an island in the Hamun near the eastern shore, is the only natural feature of any importance. In the interior and more populous tract of the Rud-i- STstan, not a tree is to be seen ; but along the banks of the Hel mand tamarisk trees abound. Everywdiere in these deltaic plains is a rich covering of low scrub and reeds, which give the country a green appearance. Approaching the Helmand at flood time, nothing but a vast expanse of water is to be seen to the west; at other times the reed beds ( naizar) have grown so high and thick, that little or no open water is visible from the shores of the mainland. The great characteristic feature of Slstan are mounds of old ruins everywhere, testifying to former prosperity. The accepted boundary line between Persian STstan and Afghanistan, as laid down by the Arbitration Commission, 1903, runs from Kuh-i-Malik Siah in a straight line to the Band-i- Kuhak, and thence along the bed of the Helmand to the point of separation of its two branches, the Rud-i-Parian and Nad-i- AlT channel. From there it follows the bed of the Nad-i-’Alichannel into the Sikhsar and along the bed of the Sikhsar to a point neai Deh \ ar Muhammad, where the river is diverted westwards in a water channel. It follows the left bank of this channel to the Shila-i-Shamshlrl; thence in a straight line to Tappeh-i-Tilai, and on to the most western of the mounds of iappeh-i-bhahrafei, the most western mound of Tappeh-i- Kurki, Shalgami, and finally Siah Kuh, Bandan. The above defines the boundaries to the north, east and south The western boundary is undefined, and maybe described generally as the Palangan Kuh range. The whole area thus approximates in shape to a triangle, and is mostly desert and umnhabited, J 01 -, Tlie ,T ltl I ate ^ area is bounded on the north by Takht-i- b^the RMYs^- A g ! W6St by the H ^un, and south by the Rud-i-Sistan and the district on the left bank irrigated by it. The whole country here is extraordinarily flat, featureless and bare of trees; but small hills or mounds (tappeh), scattered over it, afford a considerable field of view. The delta of the Helmand is intersected by a labyrinth of canals large and small; and the extreme fertility of ^he soil and the abundance of water for irrigation purposes make it extreme y rich in agricultural products. It suffers rather from excess than deficiency of water, and much damage is done by floods, as a protection against which a system of protective em^ bankments is constructed along river banks near their mouths . d 10und th ® chores of the Hamun. As the flood level of the river is several feet above the level of the surrounding countrv imilar protective works are necessary along the banks. Hamfins ^ alr f5^ been described under the heading xiamuns, The dense reed beds called naizar, which skirt it in many places, are often several miles in width, amfwlth reeds 10 or more in height.

The general trend of these mountains is north-west and south-east, and they are chiefly composed of barren limestone with an out-crop of black trap and schists. The ranges are separated by narrow valleys, and sometimes by broad saucer shaped plateaux liable to inundation during the rainy season. These valleys and plateaux contain numerous springs and •wells. In the southern portion of this system, is the Kuh-i- Malik Siah, where three frontiers meet. The Kuh-i-Khwaja, in the area subject to inundation from the Hamun, is a circular hill with an altitude of 2,037', command ing the approaches from Birjand and Neh, and affording an extensive view. There is no water on this hill, but half a mile to the west the ground is usually a swamp. Besides the Helmand, already described, the only other river of Slstan is the Sar-i-Shila or Shilag, a wide deep gully formed by the overflow of the Hamun, and draining the Paiangan Kuh. It discharges into the Gaud-i-Zireh, and its course lies through a level plain, in some places covered with tamarisk scrub, and affording grazing for sheep and cattle, in others a bare sandy desert. The amount of water in it depends on the overflow of the Hamun, for the drainage from the Paiangan Kuh is small. The fords are few, and may become impassable when inundations are deep. The sides are vertical and in place 35 feet high. The bottom at the sides is of soft treacherous material, while the centre is usually occupied by blue, intense ly saline water. Sweet water can usually be got by excavating in the sand of the bed. There is nothing in Sistan worthy of being called a town. In the area watered by the Rud-i-Sistan, especially, the villages ■with their domed buildings, present, from a distance, an air of prosperity, but on nearer approach they are found to be dirty, squalid and tumbledown, the main features being a tank of smelly water covered with a green scum, and much decaying refuse. Further east or north, in Afghan Sistan and Persian Mian Kangi, the type of village changes from domebuilt structures tocollections of wattle and daub huts, other adjuncts remaining the same. The cultivated area of Persian Sistan extends along the left bank of the old bed of the Helmand from Takht-i-Shah, its northern limit, to Band-i-Sistan about 40 miles to the south, and from east to west from the Helmand to the Hamun, about 35 miles. This is divided into four circles {Mahal). {a) Shib-i-Ab, or southern water, in the extreme south west—the most fertile of all. (6) Pusht-i-Ab, signifying beyond the river, includes all the villages west of the Rud-i-Parian and north of a line from the Band-i-Parian to the Hamun, (c) SMhrakl and (d) NahrUl named after the principal tribes inhabiting them. The first includes all the land enclosed between the villages of Dashtak, Burs- i-Sarband, Malik Haidiri, Deh Bozi, Gori and Bahram- abad. The second is bounded on the east by the Helmand from Band-i-Sistan to Band-i-Parian. The total number of villages found in these areas is con siderable. The largest villages are in the first two circles, and the more important are of a permanent character; but the small er ones are not so, for they are only constructed of wattle and daub. The principal permanent villages built of mud, or sundried bricks are:— Nasratdbad, elevation 1,977', the capital of Sistan. Popu lation about 300 families. It is the only fortified place in the country. (See Chapter VII.) Muhammaddbad in the Shib-i-Ab circle containing about 150 well-built houses, Luf with 200 houses. Sehkuha, elevation 1,405', with 300 houses and surrounded by ruined walls. 'Ahdbdd a well-built village of 250 houses with good water- S v P ?M n nd ma - ny fruifc g ardens&gt; It is the residence of the cmet Mulli of Sistan. The land near the village is exceptionally well cultivated, Banjar, the largest village in Sistan, containing about 800 houses. The surrounding country is highly cultivated.94 Burj Afghan containing about 95 houses and situated on the main road from Nasratdbdd to northern Sistan. Warmal situated at the most southern point of the culti vated area, and containing about 150 well-built houses with fruit gardens. tur’e^givTafe PART l 11 ) ClLEtfATE, * WATEB, MEDICAL AND VETERINARY, The extent and nature of the country of Persia is such that GenBra 1 descrip- it offers, like India, every variety of climate and every variation of heat and cold. Before taking each district in detail, Persia may first be roughly divided into three climates. (1) That of the elevated plateau, which on the whole is fairly temperate, and the atmosphere always clear, healthy and [y* ex t r emes are not so great as to interfere seriously with the movement of troops, though of course in the mountain ous districts in winter the cold is intense. The climate may be said to resemble that of Quetta ; Indian troops, if warmly clad, would therefore, not be injuriously affected. In the lower loca lities^ the cold only lasts for a month or two. The heat is trying especially in July and August and intensified in eastern Persia by the want of shade and water. All movements of troops would have to be carried out by night at this time; and, except among the mountains, the open nature of the country is favourable to night marching. In the north-east, the tempera ture both in summer and winter is lower than at Tehran. In the north-west the winter -is much more severe and lasts considerably longer, while it is never hot in summer. The coldest months here are December and January, and heavy falls of snow are frequent, J (2) The portions of the Caspian provinces, which are low- ly in §&gt; betw een the hlburz range and the sea, are notoriously unhealthy, owing to damp tropical heat and the mass of vege tation which covers them. (3) The Garmsir of Arabistan and the shores of the Persian Gulf, where the heat in summer and autumn is intense, and the ports become hot-beds of malaria, and are almost insupport able for Europeans, At this time it is preferable to march by night, even as late as October,95 In winter, cold winds prevail along the Gulf; and in spring, when the heated air of the deserts in the south-east begins to rise, a strong north-westerly wind sweeps down the valleys from the mountains of Kurdistan. k wlolti In all localities spring and autumn are the best time for mili tary operations. In_ spring there is more rain, but seldom suffi cient to interfere seriously with movement, except when, owing to the presence of mountainous districts, small rivers and streams usually nearly, if not quite, dry, become so flooded as to be quite impassable. There is less rain in autumn, but Indians and Persians are liable to fever, probably owing to the great differ ence in day and night temperatures. lealtlya e serioiisli moiinte itemyin rmly cki, ower 1® meats si mejaai, couatr; mpera- hran, ere aid sr. Is d hear! are to 'torMf ofv$ &gt;Pers andtis supp© larcll; ' The rainfall on the Caspian watershed is far in excess of anything in the interior. The northern face of the Elburz range is furrowed by deluges of rain, from October to April, while the southern has not a fitth of the rainfall and is bare of vegetation.^ In Khorasan, Sarhad and Dizak, the hills, owincr to their heights, attract the major part of the scanty moisture borne inland from the sea. Again, the rainfall differs very much in different parts of the country, under apparently similar conditions as regards mountains and distance from the sea; thus the dampest parts of the Tigris valley have not half the rainfall of the shores of the Caspian.

The sun’s rays on the great Iranian plateau produce a heated stratum of air, which, rising, draws in a current from the colder atmospheres over the seas to the north-west and south-east; naturally the former is the colder, and a therefore north-west winds are the more prevalent. In southern Persia, it often occurs that the two currents meet, and thus a north west gale may be blowing at Bushire, and a south-east one at Bandar’Abbas. The latter is the rain-bearing wind throughout the greater part of Persia, the exception being the north-west districts. The Gulf occasionally gets rain from the north-west, but this has always been brought up, in the first instance, by the south-east wind. Speaking generally rain may fall any time from October to April. The most rainy period is the spring, after that the autumn. General medical oondi* tions. Drinking water should always be boiled, except when i drawn straight from a spring. Dust is very bad during summer and autumn, and, with the glare and consequent prevalence of eye diseases, makes coloured spectacles desirable. Mosquitoes flourish up to 4,000 feet, wherever there is stagnant water, mala ria is therefore prevalent and mosquito nets necessary; these are also useful during the day to keep off the swarms of common flies. Sand flies are ubiquitous and troublesome ; they may be in a measure avoided by sleeping well away from any walls, and muslin bags are recommended for sleeping in. Of tropical diseases malaria and “ salek ” are the only common ones. The latter is probably the same as the Delhi boil, and is a very indolent sore, which heals over only to break out anew. It leaves a disfiguring scar, usually affects the face and forearms, and may be avoided by frequent washing and the use of antiseptic soap. The infection is probably carried by flies. Cholera visits Persia at intervals of about 12 years. Plague has never obtained a firm footing, but in 1908 the returns showed 149,938 deaths from this cause. Quarantine measures against its introduction and spread are in operation on the Gulf and in Sistan. Fever is frequently malarial, but more often the result of chill, digestive disturbances, or exposure to the sun. Enteric fever is very common, and inoculation a necessary pre caution ; also vaccination, as small-pox is very rife. Dysenteryis common, especially nn the south, and is frequently followed by liver abscess. Measles, diphtheria and scarlet fever occur everywhere. Typhus fever is dying out. Among natives, alimentary canal disturbances are the com monest complaint, especially affections of the gums, and worms stone in the bladder and eye diseases, especially cataract and granular lids, are very common. Venereal diseases are rife. Tuberculosis is often seen, owing to insanitary living; pulmonary, glandular, and bone forms are the commonest, xhe dust and heat act unfavourably, and, for haemorrhage from the lungs, the altitude also.

Everywhere there is an utter absence of sanitary arrange ments, but, in spite of everything the general health of the inha bitants is surprisingly good ; when severe epidemics appear, such as cholera brought in by the pilgrims, they die out again. Plague occasionally breaks out; small-pox is always present, malaria, tuberculosis and lung diseases are very common ; also venereal diseases. The drug habit is indulged in by the population to a grave extent. There are four public charitable dispensaries in Meshed. 1. The British Consulate-General dispensar}^. 2. The Russian Consulate-General dispensary. 3. The Russian Bank dispensary. 4. The Shrine dispensary. _ Of these only the British and Shrine dispensaries tabe in patients. The British dispensary has lately been renovated, and provided with modern and scientific up-to-date equip ment. Turbat-i-Haidari is exceedingly healthy. Owing to its elevation, it is sometimes colder both in winter and summer than Meshed, and there is a greater snowfall. The water supply is ample and good from several channels. At Tabas, the climate is mild, due to its elevation (2,1000 and also to its being in a valley, where it is sheltered from all winds except the south and south-west. In summer, however, during the day the heat is excessive, the thermometer often registering over 100°, but the nights are always cool. During the latter part of January and the early part of February, which is about the coldest time of year, the highest temperature recorded was 53° and the lowest 31°; the air at that time was cloudy or hazy. On the surrounding hills only a few miles off, the weather has been known to be exceptionally severe, and flocks of sheep caught in the snow have been totally destroyed.

From April to the end of October the thermometer varies from about 100® maximum to 40° minimum. In November it is far milder than Meshed. It is probable that a good deal of the unheal thy state of Astarabad town is due to the insanitary habits of the inhabitants, who gorge fruit, and drink very impure water. On the heights overlooking the town, there is a good camping ground, where all this sickness might be avoided with proper precautions. The place might be an agreeable winter residence, were it not for the mud; the sun is warm, but a few hundred feet up the hillsides there is snow. In the district the dense forests generate pestilential vapours, which give rise to conditions, which cause diseases that have repeatedly made fearful ravages. When rain sets in it forms stagnant pools and swamps. No. II Section.—The Caspian Provinces, Azarbaijln, ’Iraq-i- Ajami, etc. The climate of Mazandaran is universally condemned. Mazandaran It is extremely capricious, and not naturally divided into wet and dry, and cold and hot seasons. There is r.o season through out the year when the inhabitants can rely on a dry day. From December to April are the wettest, as well as the coldest months. The summers are very hot and the temperature so changeable as to cause much sickness. This is also the case in winter. Snow often falls heavily and some times lies. The cold of summer is damp and unwhole some, causing many diseases. Rheumatisms and dropsies are common, and complaints of the eyes are still more so, frequent cases of cataract occurring. Many of the inhabi tants have a sallow look, but others are remarkably stout and athletic; they live in the mountains in the hot weather. Giian is very similar in most respects to Mazandaran. Its Gilan. climate has the worst of reputations. Winter, spring, and autumn are not so bad, but even then the dampness and relaxing nature of the atmosphere causes colds and rheumatism. From the beginning of June to the end of September, the fla,t100 v Itasht. Azarbaijar. country is reputed almost uninhabitable for Europeans or other strangers ; the mountains, however, afford sanatoria. During the unhealthy months, the inhabitants sleep on raised platforms to avoid malaria. A very malignant and inve terate cutaneous disorder is mentioned as prevalent. Ringworm ulcers, etc., are also very common, and small-pox frequent. In RasH the rainfall is irregular, but, as a rule, it would appear that it is heavy in March and April; then decreasing from May to September. In the winter, there are usually several light falls of snow. Storms are rare, and generally oc cur in January, when the main road to Tehran may be impracticable for six to fifteen days. In an exceptional year, January 1905, several feet of snow fell, and the river and “ dead waters ” to Enzali froze hard enough to enable pedestrians to reach Enzali over the ice. As regards heat, the maximum is reported as 90° in July, the minimum in the same month was 70°. If the winter is very mild, no ice is collected, which causes hardship in the ensuing summer. When there is very heavy rain, the roads of the province are often impracticable for a day or two. When northerly winds prevail, it is usually impossible to land at Enzali. The climate of Azarbrijan is described as warm in sum mer and very severe in winter, but withal healthy. On the plains spring is temperate as is also autumn; but on ‘the moun tains it is always cold with, however, a hot sun in summer. The winter is long and on the mountains snow lies for seven or eight months. The excessive cold does not usually begin till the middle of December, and January is the coldest month; at night the thermometer then never rises above zero. Towards the end of I ebruary the weather becomes comparatively mild, but snow is not unknown even in May, after which month it becomes very warm. In many parts of the province, want of fuel causes great hardship during the intense cold. Prevailing winds are easterly and mostly light, except in spring, when light westerly winds usually blow. The lowest thermometer readings occur in January, when 7° below zero has been noted, but this is unusual, ihe maximum in the same month varies between 30 and 3 / . In June, July, August and September, the maximum reading is often between 90° and 98° and the minimum usu ally just under/0°. The climate is generally dry, vigorous and healthy. The high altitudes appear to have the effect of mak-mg the people nervous and excitable. There are a few low swampy valleys, as Khof, where fever is prevalent; otherwise it is rare. Owing to ignorance, the mortality among children is very high. Diseases. All forms of zymotic and eye diseases are very common. Stone in the bladder, indigestion, and heart dis ease are common. Lung diseases and tuberculosis less common. \accination and inoculation are commonly practised. Tabriz is celeorated as one of the most healthy cities in Tabri? Persia, in spite of its extremes of heat and cold. In summer the breeze cools the air, but raises dense clouds of dust. There are perfect summer sanitoria within easy reach. Water is scarce and is brought from springs at a distance bv aoue- ducts. ' . 1 Ardabll is cold and not considered healthy, as strong Ardabii. north-east winds prevail. In Kurdistan snow falls for four months in the year, Kurdistan, during 'w liic.ii time tlie inlinbitciiits live in underground lious- es, which are generally quite useless as a protection against the weather. In these they store food, fuel, and fodder for themselves and their cattle. Fuel is very scarce. The soil is said to be saturated with water. The prevailing complaint is ophthalmia and other kindred diseases. Sinneh is said to have good summer sanitoria, with excellent water-supply in the neighbouring hills. The climate of Kirm'nshah is mild in summer, but very Kirmanshah. cold in winter; if the summer is abnormally hot, the inhabit ants migrate to the neighbouring hills. The weather, how ever, varies considerably every year. The rains fall from November to March, except in January and February when it is replaced by snow. November and March are the tv r o wettest months, and January and February the two coldest the cold being intense. The rivers commence rising ' in November and should be at their highest in April, v’hen the snow on the hills melts ; they would not be fordable durino- that period. Fever is very prevalent during September and October, and sometimes in November ; troops should camp on high grounds during that period. The roads in the low- lying valleys become very heavy in rainy seasons, The sum*102 Garus. Iraq-i-Ajam. Tehran. Hamadan. mer corresponds to Quetta, being in most seasons rather warmer. Crops are gathered in July. The prevailing winds are south and east. The town of Bljar in Garus is situated at a very high al titude, which entai's the disadvantages of a rigorous winter and scanty water-supply. The climate of the geographical division called Tr'q- i-Ajam is naturally very varied. In the neighbourhood of Isfahan it is temperate, equable and delightful, and, except for a few -weeks of the year, the sky is unclouded ; the rains are never heavy, and snow never lies long on the ground; the air is pure and dry, and the regularity of the seasons extra ordinary. The northern portion does not enjoy so favour able a climate. The country about Hamad in is very moun tainous, and the winter severe, while Kd Juln and Qum, which are situated on the edge of the desert, are exposed to consider able heat in summer, especially the former. Tehran is liable to great vicissitudes of climate and is not deemed salubrious. The reasons urged are that there is no river, and that water has to be brought from the Elburz in qanats; that, situated in the hollow of the plain, the infiltration of surrounding moisture predisposes to malarial fever, and then the drainage is bad. In reply to these objections Lord Curzon remarks that most Persian rivers are little better than stream lets for the greater part of the year, so not much loss; that the city is situated at an altitude of over 3,800', and the climate is delightful for the greater part of the year ; while in summer there is an easy retreat to the mountain slopes. Thermo meter readings average a maximum of 42-S 0 and minimum 26 - 2° for January, and a maximum OS’S 0 and minimum 72’1° for July. December to March are the cold months. The nights are hottest in June, averaging 77 •2°. From October to March the winds are from the north and east, from April to September from the south and west. Kain falls in every month, but very slightly from May to October ; the most rainy month is March, with an average fall of 2 • 80', the driest June, with an average of O’OJ'. Hamadan has an excellent water-supply, and being situated on a plain 6,000 feet above -the sea, it has an almost ideal climate, though intensely cold in winter. Fever, however,prevails here once a year, and sometimes cholera breaks out. Small-pox attacks children, who succumb to it in great numbers. Almost everyone suffers from eye diseases. Snow remains on the mountains for 10 months in the year, and on the plain for 4 months. Fuel is fairly plentiful, Qum has an abundant water-supply, which is brackish Jn Q Um . summer. The summers are hot, but less so than Kdshdn, and the winters severe. In autumn dust-storms are common. Diphtheria is prevalent, small-pox seldom absent, and oph thalmia and diarrhoea common in the summer and autumn. Kdshdn is very hot in the summer, and the inhabitants Ea s Iia a. then live underground. The most trying months are June, July and August. Winter is not severe, but some frost and snow may be expected. Water-supply is good frorn^ 3 qandts and some excellent underground cisterns. Kdshdn is healthy, especially in spring. In summer and autumn intermittent fever and diarrhoea, and in winter bronchitis, are the principal diseases. Epidemics of measles, small-pox and diphtheria occur. The climate of Isfahan is dry and bracing ; in summer Isfahan, during the middle of the day it is very hot, but seldom op pressive. The nights, except for six weeks, July to the mid dle of August, are moderately cool and pleasant . _ I he winter lasting for four months is often severe, snow lying for days together. The rainfall is usually less than in the surround ing districts. The water-supply from canals and wells is abundant and of good quality. Isfahan and are re markably healthy places and, were it not for epidemics, would have a very low death rate. Europeans do not seem to be affected by the hot weather. December, January and February are the coldest months, the maximum average rea ing in January being 46’5°, the minimum o . J . September are the hot months, the maximum July being 98,° the minimum 66-2°. Ram mils o ll y f October to May, the heaviest records being November ° and March O'99'. Average total for the year is between 4 and 5 inches. Snow does not usually fall unti &lt; ajnuary melts rapidly. Rain is almost invariably south-west or west-south-west wind. Ro wim s &lt; y occur at Isfahan. Travelling is done by n A 1 |J ° summer, the temperature is then comparative y coo ,104 I'aisa. 1 azd is so situated, that none of the disagreeable effects 0 damp are felt, the water is not found at less than 200 fe Q t below the surface and the climate is very dry. The winds com* down from the north and east, in spring and summer, with great force bringing such sandstorms, that the place becomes as dark as night; while great desiccating heatwaves burn up everything m their way. The quantity of sand in the town has a good effect on the sewage system. During the summer heat, say the middle of June to about the end of August, life in tents in the plains in the daytime would be almost unbearable and it would be necessary to protect animals from the direct rays of the sun; the nights, on the other hand, are tolerably cool The plains are particularly barren and little or no shade could be obtained from trees; there are, however, large wardens in the vicinity oi Yazd, where ample shade could be°found In the valleys of the mountains to the west of Yazd, and at daft, a place about 16 miles also to the west, which is a summer resort or the inhabitants, trees are numerous. From 1 azd to Taft there is a good carnage road, and roads to tne valleys beyond are not difficult for mules, donkeys and horses. During the whole of the winter, it would be possible to live in tents in the plains; but it would be very trying and some means of heating them would be necessary. Transport animals would have to be sheltered from the cold, especially during the night. From the beginning of April to. the end of May, and from the middle of September to the end of November would be the best time for being under canvas, and, except for occasional sandstorms; the weather would leave nothing to be desired. The average weather is summarized as follows April weather pleasant, except for sandstorms. May —never uncomfortably hot. June generally hot, but nights cool. July—hot, but nights fairly cool. August—hot, but cooler about the middle nights cool. of the month; September —warm to cool. October —pleasant,November —generally cold, snow on hills. December —cold, occasionally mild days. January —cold with cold winds. February —cold with cold winds. March about the middle of the month it begins to get warm. The temperatures range from several degrees of frost in winter to 90 o -105° in summer in the shade. In the moun tains, 30 miles to the west, it is cool during the day in summer and chilly at night. All parts of this district, in the plains, are similar in climate ; but, where there are trees and water, it ii several degrees cooler. When the weather is cloudy at Yazd, there is generally snow or rain falling on the mountains. In the plains the actual rainfall is very little. The snowfall is not worth mentioning as it melts almost immediately, but remains all the year round in sheltered spots on the moun tains, and thus supplies the city with snow during the hot season. In this district, as in Isfahan also, the nature of the ground being more or less sandy, it quickly dries up after rain or snow; the roads are always open and the movement of troops would never be restricted from this cause. The climate of Luristan, owing to the great differences Luristan. of elevation, varies considerably. During most months of the year it is temperate, with somewhat excessive cold in higher altitudes in mid-winter, and severe heat in the lower valleys in mid-summer; the latter are practically deserted at this period. In Khurramdbdd in the winter the cold is severe with a considerable snowfall, but the transition to summer is very rapid. Prom the end of March the country begins to be covered with verdure. The summer is torrid and during the months of June, July, August and September the inhabi tants move to the hills. In October the rain is heavy. The upper BakhtiarT country enjoys, in summer, a cool Bakhtiari climate and verdure. In winter it has a severity, which country ' makes it impossible to live in tents; the roads and passes are closed, and from want of traffic remain so till the snow melts. A certain proportion of the inhabitants reside throughout the winter in permanent villages. The nomads move to the hills in April, remaining there until the end of September; they are106 Bakhtlari Qarmsir. quite unprepared as regards clothing to stand the winter cold, and so then move down. During summer and autumn in the marshy plains of Malamir and Chighakhur mosquitoes are extremely troublesome, also sandflies. Crops in high land valleys are sown before the snow-fall in October, and reaped late the following summer, just before the next crop is sown. Generally speaking, the shade temperature falls 5° for every 1,000' ascended over 2,000'; up to that point, there is rather an increase than diminution. The climate is not unlike that of the lower ranges of the Himalayas, before the rains fall, but is on the whole somewhat drier. There is no regular rainy season, and outside the area of heavy snowfall, the rainfall does not exceed IS' per annum. Rain generally falls in October in the Chehar Mahal and Chighakhur district, and the nights begin to be cold and frosty. The dryness of the air and elevation above the sea engen ders a wide variation between day and night temperatures. The climate, on the whole, is well suited for Europeans, and good sanatoria are available. It is only after Deli Diz has been passed, that the summer temperature begins to be comfortable during the day. In the Bakhtiarx Garmsir, from November to January the days are often chilly, and nights frosty; the climate resembles that of the Punjab, and, like it, is bracing and dry. From January to March heavy rain must be looked for, though its total volume will seldom exceed 7' in the year. The rainfall of the district is heavier to the north than to the south, and heavy rain frequently falls at Malamir and Rnmuz, which has no counterpart at Ahiodz. Cold winds are a feature of the winter, and inflict great dis comfort on man and beast. Normal winter scale of clothing is sufficient for troops, and by 1st April summer scale is sufficient. From 1st May onwards the heat becomes very great, ex ceeding that of the Punjab, and troops under canvas would suffer. The summer is characterized by extreme dryness, but the o-hts are bearably cool. Troops should not, if possible, be kept l the country after May 1st, unless in proper huts.Diseases most commonly met with in western countries are infrequent. Out of 100 respiratory cases registered in one year, 80 were bronchial, asthmatic, or both, 3 pneumonia, 2 phthisis, 6 pleu risy and pulmonary catarrh; of these, tent dwellers only furnished one case. The qaliun (pipe) is largely responsible for the predominance of bronchial asthmatic cases. The Lurs when smoking inhale direct into the lungs. Cardiac diseases are very infrequent, but malarial fever is prevalent and occurs in the form of an intermittent fever, which is most frequent in the autumn and spring. It is usually benign in character and not often relapsing. The remittent and other malignant types are much less in proportion. Few Europeans escape an attack of the intermittent type in the spring or autumn. Ophthalmic diseases are prevalent. Europeans who protect the eyes from sand and glare with goggles are usually im mune. Digestive troubles form perhaps SO per cent, of all the cases met with, they are usuallly due to unripe fruit and excessive quantities of water consumed during the summer ; also to in sanitary diet. Parasitic diseases, chiefly intestinal, are very common. Dysentery is in a very mild form only, and occurs chiefly among children. Ancemia, not caused by malaria, occurs among both men and women. Bright's Disease is common among the upper classes, due to excessive indulgence in alcohol and opium. Diabetes is common among the same class. Venereal disease is generally prevalent in the towns. Infectious fevers do not seem largely distributed, notwith standing the state of filth the natives live and thrive in. Plague has not occurred for many years. Quarantine regulations are in force at Muhammareh,108 Rheumatism is often met with even in the driest season. It is commonly chronic. Scurvy rarely attacks natives of the country, although vegetables are not often obtainable. There were, however cases among the Indian troops stationed at Maiddn Minaftun. Skin affections are met with daily. The Baghdad ulcer attacks Europeans as readily as natives. The rapidity with which surgical wounds heal, particularly in the summer, is worthy of note. All wounds are dressed dry in the hot weather, when no dressings will remain wet. Gutta percha tissue is destroyed by the heat. The draining of wounds is sometimes troublesome, as gauze when inserted dries up shortly afterwards and acts as a plug ; India rubber tubing will not keep, except under water, and unless there is much pus or secretion it may dry in the wound. Fenestrated glass tubes answer the purpose best. Abscesses on the palms, fingers and soles are frequent, affecting those whose occupation compels them to handle material heated by the sun. Pullet wounds, if taken in hand early, heal well and rapidly in the hot season, but more slowly in the winter. The general division of the year is into four main seasons here—summer, mid-April to mid-October ; autumn, mid-October to December; winter, December to mid-February; spring mid-February to mid-April. The hot winds begin in May or June ; they are most severe for about six weeks and never disappear before the middle of September. The heat begins in May and gradually rises from 90° to 124° and 126° in the shade in August. About 41 months in the year the temperature in the shade is never under 100°. The nights are cool as a rule. The rains are from November to April. It is coldest from the end of December to the end of January, when thethermometer sometimes goes down to 15°. Cold winds and storms may be very severe. Underground houses are the best protection against the heat; but food and water must not be kept in them., otherwise they become nests of mosquitoes. They are the only means of avoiding the abominable hot winds. There is a consular dispensary at Ahwaz which is most popular. The climate of the Kuhgalu country is similar to that of Kulgalu the Bakhtiari hills, but milder. The little valley of Dishmuk country. (6,500') is said to be under snow for several months in winter, but the flimsy dwellings of the inhabitants, who live there all the year round, indicate that the cold is not severe for long. The hot weather in Northern ’Arabistan is absolutely Northern rainless ; the cold weather moist and long but even in winter ’ Arabiitan ’ protracted droughts may be expected. The rains ordinarily begin at the end of October, the weather at the same time getting cooler, and continue at intervals, till the end of March. The rainfall decreases from north to south, Dizful receiving more than Shushtar and Shushtar more than places to the south. In ordinary years, though very high summer tempera tures are registered by day, the nights, at least in the open country, are generally cool. The climate is not an unhealthy one, though in Dizful and Shustar the bad sanitation may make it so. In Southern ’Arabistan, rain may fall at any time between the Southern middle of October and the middle of May; but the principal ’Arabistan. rains generally occur in December, and heavy local showers are usual about the time of the vernal equinox. In February rain is scarce. The total annual rainfall is insignificant. About the middle of May, a dry north-west wind generally blows for ten days, and is followed by a calm of similar duration before the setting in of the barik, or great north-wester, which lasts about 40 days. After the bank come, usually, ten days of light southerly breezes, and, thereafter, hot winds from the north-west, and damp winds from the south-east blow alternately till the end of August,110 When the hot wind comes off a sandy desert, the dust carried by it is very trying to unprotected parts of the body, The summer heat in the plains is intense, but dry and not unhealthy, and, from the middle of October to the end of April, the climate is pleasant. The above is the ordinary but not invariable course of the seasons. The desert near Muhammareh, being a sort of clay, becomes difficult to traverse after a day’s heavy rain. Further up, where there is an admixture of sand, it soon dries, but movement would be extremely arduous, for two or three days or longer, if he ground was already moist. The temperature at Muhammareh town ranges, in the course of the year, from 32° to 115° on shore, and from 27° to 120° under double awnings, on boardship. In July, on shore, the usual daily range is from 85° to 110° ; and in January from 40° to 57°. Nights at Muhammareh are seldom oppressive near the Karun river. At Ahwaz the nights are still cooler, and the climate there is drier, but owing to there being no trees in the neighbourhood, it is exposed to the full force of the hot winds during the day. In the beginning of September it is sometimes damp, and the heat is no longer excessive. There is usually frost in the morning between 27th January and 4th February, and in some years in December or early Jan uary. The water of the Karun river is good. With regard to diseases : these are practically identical to those of the Bakhtiarl garmsir, as described above. Duimg wet weather, fever and dysentery often attack natives. As to the salubrity of Muhammareh opinions differ. One ie- port states that from June to October it is deadly for Europeans, but for the rest of the year well adapted to the operations of wan All agree that malaria may be brought about by the soi, which seems to retain moisture from the continued decomposi tion of both animal and vegetable matter, as is thecase in 6 Indus and Nile and in all deltas formed by deposits from nvers. Opinions coincide as regards the salubrity of the fplace, trom the beginning of October to the end of March, i® lave ta 'ffaij condition c jg, irMci is atti Ju climate of Fa ^TiK In the is of the coast lii »said. climate of the Mi-EMsI on thi iitiesf, andlifiz &gt; Sak may be expe M occasional sh lijta than that di ikadaybutot Wi-Whtar, Kuta wloifr, Alike liWMrdz % the cold sea slaarv to the mi iwolen intense 4lftfrmonieter s •tpBrare, fron ^rtected in an breather be %ting till abou 'hhia narked fa ^iitedutasu Piffling the he ^«a«iially iff they are iIll l toil §£: shore, si is: ip, IiJsliit ; and is fa ire seld® f andtlsdia sin the ^ . ninds dfa : rch. There have been bad epidemics of cholera here. The insanitary condition of the town no doubt accounts for much sickness, which is attributed to climate,, The climate of Fars varies according to the configuration of pars, the province. In the high levels it is salubrious, but of the climate of the coast line and plain land the worst things pos sible are said. The climate of the Shiraz district, and of the area bounded Shiraz, by Yazd-i-Khdst on the north, Firuzdbdd on the south, Kdzarun on the west, and Nirlz on the east, is as follows. Rain may be expected between 21st November and 15th aboiit^is' 811 ^ April and occasional showers from the latter date to 31st May. f 11 average fail Ram rarely falls more than three nays m succession*. Snow may of this about 5' be expected at any time between 15th December and 1st April, ^ ^ ta^Feb 7 rarely later than that date on the Shiraz plain ; it seldom lies for ruary. more than a day, but on the passes between Shiraz and Kdzarun (Kutal-i-Dukhtar, Kutal-i-Pir Zan, etc.) it may be from 3 to 8 days or longer. A like remark applies to the higher portion of the road from Shiraz to Yazd-i-Khdst. During the cold season, which may be taken to extend from 1st January to the middle or even the end of March, the nights are often intensely cold. On 28th January 1905, at 7-30 A.M., the thermometer stood at 17.° Such excessive cold, how ever, appears rare, from the fact that orange and lemon trees grow unprotected in and round Shiraz. The hot weather begins about the end of June or beginning of July, lasting till about the 26th August, when there appears to be always a marked fall in the temperature. Hot days occur after this date, but a succession of hot days is rare. Even during the hottest weather the nights are generally cool, but occasionally, when a warm wind blows from the south or south-west, they are unpleasantly warm. It is both possible and beneficial to sleep in the open ai r from May to October, or even later. No shelter is required. Up to the end of September there is practically no dew, and only occasionally after that date. There is sometimes a recrudescence of heat in October. The prevailing wind appears to be from the south-west, in summer ; this is often hot and enervating.112 The best seasons for operations are from 1st April to the middle or end of May and from 21st September to 15th Novem ber or even later in the year. During the hot season marches are made in the early morning or late evening. The direct rays of the sun are felt throughout the day out of all proportion to the general temperature. There seems little doubt that the climate of Shiraz is not so good as first appears, and is often trying to Europeans; though excellent in spring and winter, it is spoilt in the summer and autumn by the prevalence of malarial fever. There was a severe cholera epidemic in 1904. The barren mountains in the neighbourhood are snow-cap ped during the winter months. As to medical conditions, there is an utter absence of sani tation or drainage in the city, and the whole sub-soil is saturated with refuse. The water itself is good, but being brought in by qandts is easily infected. Considering all things Shiraz is wonderfully free from epidemics. Any epidemics usually occur in spring or autumn; dysen tery is somewhat severe during the height of summer. Cholera is sometimes imported from the Gulf or western frontier. In the last epidemic in 1904, the mortality was not less than 5,000. The only striking points about the health conditions here are the number of cases of diseases of the cornea and conjunctiva, dyspepsia, ascites and venereal complaints. In the south-eastern corner of Ears, Jdhrum is described as a very hot, dusty place in the summer and never really cold in winter, as snow never lies, even on the surrounding hills. The water here requires careful selection, as in many of the wells it is very bad. Biishire. The hottest month is August and the coldest are January^ and February. In summer the thermometer has been known to rise to IIS'S 0 . The worst period is between 20th July and 15th September, owing to excessive moisture in the air. The rainfall is mostly in November (1-72'), December (2-58')&gt; January (1-23' ), and February (O’TS'). This may be said to constitute the rainy season. These four months are intermittently stormy and cold on shore, the sea being rough. li seldom act gulp falls aim 1 reity in Decern ifemndown unti afallis usually ii Isotlierwise clear, fie prevailing to or south-east, smtlis of le year iter months; a todays, Thesa sat® near the co “ttys' wind ”, M August th iae up to the end M»hfs, The 1 like end of Octo lit Mister, August hkis the transit ffiimriable.

Fires are almost a necessity in December, January and February, and welcome after sundown until the end of March. In March and April the rainfall is usually in the form of brief showers, the sky remain ing otherwise clear. The prevailing winds are the slmmdl or north-west, and haus or south-east. The former prevails at sea for nearly nine months of the year and blows very cold and boisterously in the winter months ; a shamdl or ‘ ‘ nor-wester ’ ’ lasts usually three days. The same wind blows almost incessantly during June and July and, though then less violent, relieves the tem perature near the coast. At this season it is called locally the 1 ‘ 40 days’ wind ’ ’. Until August the nights are generally tolerably cool; from thence up to the end of September they are sultry and still, with dewy nights. The hot season is from the beginning of May till the end of October. May is usually very dry, June and July moister, August and September very moist and oppressive. October is the transition month between hot and cold weathers and is variable. The hottest temperatures (109° to 110°) have been recorded in August. The cold season commences on the sea coast about 15th November and is keen and bracing. From the beginning of December to the middle of March, it would he difficult to find a finer climate. The lowest temperature recorded of late years is 34*2° when there was a fall of snow, hut this is abnormal. The best seasons for the movements of troops through Bushire. would be (1) from 15th March to 30th April and {:“) from 1st October to 30th November. Between the 1st May and 1st October, the heat for the first 60 miles from the coast would be very trying for troops on the march, and would be oppressive even on the plateau. In December, January and February the cold on the plateau is excessive. During the same periods the sea is most likely to be propi tious, for the landing of troops in the difficult harbour of Bushire. The sanitary condition of the town is bad, yet the place is not unhealthy. Malarial fever is the most prevalent disease among the natives, Ophthalmic and other eye diseases are114 Laristan. Lingeh. Bandar ’Abbas. rife, caused by flies, dust, glare and insanitary habits. The water from w'ells in the town is bad and bitter ; even that brought from some distance outside is brackish and affects people not accustomed to it. The climate of Laristan is trying to Europeans. In the belt that lies between the shores of the Gulf and the higher ranges inland, the heat in summer is very great and is increased by the sandy and barren plains with which this tract abounds. During the first two months of summer a strong north-westerly wind prevails over the whole district, which at times blows with such force that it brings w’ith it clouds of a highly impalpable sand. In the autumn, the heat is more oppressive than in the summer, but in winter and spring the climate is pleasant. The cold is never great and snow seldom falls. The rains, which are not heavy, fall in the winter or early spring and are almost alw’ays accompanied by a south-east wind, A\hich though often violent hardly ever continues for more than three or four days at a time. The inhabitants depend largely for their water-supply on we lls and on cisterns and reservoirs built with great labour to collect the scanty rainfall. The above also applies to the sea port of Lingeh, where the water from birkehs is almost exclusively used, as that of the wells is brackish. The climate of Bandar 'Abbas is notorious for its heat and unhealthiness. The summer heat is almost intolerable, due to the combination of moist air from the stagnant bay in front of the town with the reflected and radiated heat from the moun tain wall behind. Even in the depths of winter the mercury seldom falls below freezing point. January and February are cool and salubrious with occa sional showers of rain, which are sometimes heavy. In March, April and May the surrounding country dries up and malaria prevails. From June to September the heat is intense and most of the inhabitants desert the town, but fever diminishes. From October to December the heat is on the wane, but malarial fevers are once more rife. Mosquitoes are troublesome in the spring and autumn.There are wells in the town, but the water from them is bad, brackish ana conduces to guinea-worm and kidney diseases.

From 1st May to the end of September, the excessive heat makes it practically impossible to move about by day or by night and the climate conditions are so bad as to render it practically unbearable to Europeans.

The average number ot days m any one month would be three or four only. The average annual rainfall for the city is only 5-7', floods caused by rain subside in 24—36 hours and the yround dries very quickly, but, where not pure sand or stone, it is very slippery when wet and then difficult to march over. I he heat is never excessive on the top of the plateau, but in mid-summer it might be advisable to march by night rather than116 lam. Persian Dalachfetan. by day. Iu the Garmslr it is so hot from April to October that campaigning would be impossible ; the nights there, however, are chilly from November to March. There is no very extreme cold on the plateau. November to March are cold, especially January and February; the night temperature in these two months is usually 9°-10 o below freezing point. Very rarely temperatures below zero are registered as late as March. Snow usually falls during January and February, but not before or after. Roads are occasionally blocked by it even as low as Bam, but it seldom falls there or anywhere off the plateau. The city of Kirmdn is very free from wind. The pre vailing winter wind is very cold and from the west. On the Sarvistan plain and from Tehrud to Abdriq, a high bitterly cold wind blows all the winter. In summer the breeze is cool on the plateau ; but down below there are hot winds, which, across the Lut, are intensely and dangerously hot. The only other climatic condition, which would interfere with the marching of troops, is the melting of the snow in the spring, causing floods in the rivers, which are, however, very sel dom unfordable at the places where the main caravan routes cross them Artesian well boring has been tried, but was not success ful There is a fine supply of water in Kirmdn city, but, owing to the open channels through which it runs, it is most impure, and wells are not safe, as sewage percolates into them. Certain mineral properties in the water cause stomacli complaints. Venereal disease is rampant. Blindness, defective eye-sight, and skin complaints due to dirt are wide-spread. Opium smoking is almost universal. Bam possesses a fertile soil, and a climate equally suitable or palm trees and many upland products. The water is good from fames. A cool north wind mitigates the summer heat, the mountain villages of the Jabal Bam range afford cool rrfrpa.ts close at hand.

The valleys of the Bampur division are stifling in the summer months, while Bampur itself is notorious Bampur. for its unhealthiness. Among the highlands of Sarhad different conditions prevail, and on the slopes of the Kuh-i-Taftan are spots suitable for hill stations, but destitute of supplies. Here the air is dry and bracing, and in winter snow and ice are not uncommon ; in fact heavy snowstorms have been recorded even at Bampur in February. Among the mountains four seasons rpevail, but towards the south, two only—the cold and the hot. The climate of Bampur district is notoriously bad even for Baluchistan, the highly irrigated land along the river, and the burning sandy desert beyond it, give rise to sudden variations of temperature and changes from extreme dryness to complete saturation. The cold weather is pleasant, but subject to great variations of heat and intense cold. It begins to get warm in February, and in March the climate usually becomes hot, and un healthy at the same time. The whole of the hot weather is un healthy and unpleasant, the temperature in July being 112°- 116°. In Makran the cold weather lasts from October to April; Makran. the hot weather from May to October. The maximum winter temperature on the coast varies from 87° to 94°, and the maxi mum summer temperature from 94° to 110°. Rainfall is un certain, but usually occurs during November to February; occasionally continuing into March. The annual rainfall prob ably averages between 6 and 7 inches, but differs considerably in the various localities. In summer it would be most inadvis able for Europeans to sleep under canvas by day, on account of heat; while, wherever water exists, mosquitoes and other insect pests abound, making rest almost impossible. Qasrqand is noted for its mosquitoes ; as a consequence mala- Qvsrqand. ria is common. Even the poorest inhabitants here sleep under mosquito curtains during the hot months. The climate of Slstdn is one of great variety and sudden sistan. changes, which take place with curious regularity year after year. There are practically only two seasons, for spring and autumn hardly exist. The transition from winter to sum118 iner and vice-versd is so rapid as to be sometimes only a matter of a few hours. Summer sets in at any date between the end of March and end of April; and winter sets in with equal sudden- ness at any time between the beginning and end of November. May and the first half of June are very hot and trying The temperature rises to a maximum of 120° in the shade, and owing to a total absence of wind, myriads of mosquitoes and other winged insects are very troublesome. At the end of May or middle of June, the celebrated bdd-i-sad-v- hist ruz (120 days’ wind) sets in, and blows almost continu ously till the middle or end of September. It blows unceas- ingly for 4 or 5 days at a time, usually attaining its maximum daily velocity between midnight and 5 am., and again between 8 a.m. and 5 f.m. It moderates a little in the earlv morning and evening. After 4 or 5 days, it drops a little for a day or two, only to recommence with renewed violence. Its velo city has been registered up to 72 miles per hour. Its direction is a httle west of north, and never varies. Although causing discomfort from dust, noise, etc., it saves Sistan by blowing away the insects, mitigating the heat, and clearing the country ot typhus, small-pox and diseases rife in- May and June. VYithout this wind the Sistan summer would be almost unbear able, and very unhealthy; when it ceases finally, which it does abruptly, the temperature again rises. tent best adapted to this wind is the “Bell’’shape, as it affords less purchase than straight sided patterns. Tent doors should open south. Long wooden tent pegs shodd be provided and the centre pole be stronger than that usually em l ) fhe hot weather wet tatties, made from local camel thorn, will reduce the temperature of a house to about No clouds are seen from the middle of May until September. Cloudy weather begins about Christmas and showers of light ram occasionally fall during the winter. The quantity is never excesmve, but, owing to the high level of the ground water, and the fiat surface of the clay soil, a fall of even halt an inch is sufficient to interfere seriously with transport animals, es- peciahy camels, owing to the slippery condition of the surface soil. &gt;.now is not unknown, but is abnormal. Blizzards are frequent from the 1st January to the end of March, and thetemperature then falls far below freezing. The cold in winter is often very severe; minimums' have been registered of 12° in December, 4° in January, and'8° in March, but the mean monthly minimum from December to March appears to rarme from 25° to 35°. The chief characteristic of the_Sxstan climate is the wind. Reference has already been made to the “ 120 days’ wind ”, and, with the exception of calm periods in May and the beginning of June, and again from the end of September to December, winds are very prevalent. They always blow from the same quarter with great,violence for 3 to 5 days at a stretch. A strong blow is always to be expected a week or ten days after Nauruz (21st March), known as the Bdd-i-Nauruz. Only in unsettled weather, and then only for a short time, does the wind change from north to south, south-west, or south-east. This is always a sign of bad weather, and an unpleasant wind at any time of year. It never blows hard from the south. The rainfall is very slight, and in ordinary years can hardly exceed 3 to 4 inches. In 1904 there was barely | an inch during the whole year. May to October may be considered practic ally rainless. The level of the ground water in the Helmand delta is fairly l^vel of ground high throughout the year, the height varying with the water ' condition of the river, which in turn is dependent on the snow fall on the Afghan hills for its supply. Thus good drinking water can always be obtained by means of shallow wells, and surface floods increase the difficulties of transport. From January to June, articles liable to damage by water should always be carried in waterproof bags, and troops on the march should avoid low-lying ground, as such places may easily be flooded by the breaching of one of the numerous canals. Sistan has been represented as an unhealthy country; Medical, with this medical opinion by no means agrees. Malaria was re ported as almost non-existent, especially in the south and west; but lately it has been more prevalent, notably in Miankangl, and it was suggested that it had been imported by the Boundary Commission. In Miankangl district mosquitoes are so numerous in the hot weather, that every Jiouse is fitted with a gauze sleep ing place. The water-supply of the Helmand is copious, first120 class in quality and constantly flowing ; while the numbers of the population are not sufficiently large to pollute it. The floods of the river and canals, in March and April, carry off all debris and filth into the Hamun. The above all tend to make Slstan healthy. The diseases endemic are typhus and its variants, small-pox, and probably enteric. The first (breaks out every few years into epidemics, the apparent cause being the lowness of the Hel- mand the previous year with consequent scarcity, famine, etc. Small-pox is always present and appears to be most severe in the hot weather. Cholera does not as a rule reach Slstan. Venereal disorders are exceedingly common. Diseases of the eye are also common, due to the constant gravel and dust in the air, and the glare from the saline efflores cence and gravel plain. Intestinal disorders are not common, except when away from the water of the Helmand, and it is necessary to use well water, which is usually saline. During the cold season, there are practically no vegetables procurable in Sfstan, with the exception of a small quantity of onions and turnips. If troops were employed on a large scale, it would be necessary to import potatoes or provide some anti scorbutic during the winter. In the hot weather grapes and melons are to be had in abundance. Diseases of the respiratory tract are fairly common throughout the year. Some pneumonia nmy be expected during the cold weather. Plague was epidemic in 1905-06, but there has been no sign of its recrudescence. This disease broke out towards the end of 1905 among the Saiyads, a nomadic race of fishermen and fowlers inhabiting the Naizar, and from them spread to the mainland. No such disease had ever before appeared among the inhabitants in the memory of man. In point of virulence of spread, it did not resemble plague as seen in India, and villages taking proper precautions wele immune. Inoculation was tried successfully and this, with isolations and cordons, caused the disease to die out completely.

In 1897, an international sanitary convention sat at Venioe to concert measures for the prevention of the introduction and spread of the plague, and for the necessary supervision of the Red Sea and Persian Gulf traffic. General rules were agreed on and regulations issued, especially as regards pilgrim ships. It was suggested that Hormuz and Basrah were well situated for sanitary posts. There is now a strict quarantine in the Persian Gulf under the supervision of the Residency Surgeon, Bushire. This includes Muhammareh, where there is an important station under the British Consulate. At the neighbouring port of Basrah, the Turkish authorities long ago instituted very troublesome quarantine restrictions. Anthrax .—There is reason to believe that this disease is endemic in Sistan ; and as most of the grating-ground on the edges of the Hamiin are infected, there is no likelihood of such land being free from infection for many years to come. Heavy mortality amongst transport animals may be expected from this disease, if the animals are kept in Sisian during the autumn. In October 1906 there was a violent outbreak of the disease, which attacked cattle, horses, mules, donkeys and sheep. Em quiries elicited the fact that the visitation is an annual one. It appeared to decline in November, but has reappeared^.nee at about the same time of year. The horses of the detachment of the 35th Scinde Horse, ac companying the Sistan Boundary Commission, 1903 to 1905, suffered heavily from a disease, which has more or less certainly been identified as “ surra ”. The mules suffered to a less degree. The cases may be divided into acute and chronic. {1) Acute cases terminated fatally with extraordinary rapidity in 4 or 5 days. Often there were no premonitory symptoms, but after seizure there was a thick yellow discharge from tow nostrils, and a very foul breath. (2) In chronic cases the general symptoms were (а) Fever. (б) Anaemia. (c) General and progressive emaciation. The fever was irregularly recurrent for 3 or 4 months, after which the animal wasted away steadily, and died on the average in 5 to 7 months.

The grass was carefully dried before being given. Afterwards during the win ter months, the horses were entirely fed on bhusd. Sick horses were segregated. The Persians shut tip any animal of valtie all the summer, and practically never use them. This custom has arisen from the disease being attributed by them to the Sistani fly. They say that donkeys and cattle are immune. These flies attack horses, mules and donkeys on the belly and sheath especially, and on the chest; in fact wherever the skin is thinnest. They are not troublesome at night, and will not go into a dark stable. In treating cases of “ surra ” arsenic was tried with little effect. Quinine was only effective for the first few months. The Persians recognise four horse-sicknesses here, (1) Ghazl gurt, similar to acute surra. Symptoms.—The horse is attacked very suddenly, looks found at his side as if in pain, especially behind the elbow, then appears to go mad and throws himself violently about. Fi lially he falls down kicking and struggling, is unable to rise, and dies in a few days. Treatment .—Firing on both flanks from elbows to loin branded early enough the horse may recover. (2) Sangin-i-SufkJi (red dung), corresponding to chronio Surra. Symptoms.—Horse gets attacks of fever, his mouth (mucous membrane) becomes white; he eats badly, especially after work, lung becomes red and hard, he grows weaker and weaker, and after s'x or seven months pus may form in his hind legs. The disease lasts a long time, but after six or eight months the horse is useless for work. Hard or fast work in early or late summer renders a horse liable to the disease. Treatment, —.Nil, (3) Aman .-—Soft and large swellings appear on belly, sheath, shoulder and chest. Those on the chest and shoulder124 fire most serious; they may rise to the neck and throat and suffo cate the animal in one or two days. On other parts the swell ings are not so serious. It the disease is not fatal in a few days there is a prospect of the animal’s recovery in a month or so. Treatment. —Firing. This is done in a circle round each swelling separately, with one or two cross lines through the circle. (4) Murghak (kumri) is recognised, hut not common. It is attributed to exposure to cold wind when heated and treated by firing. There were cases, which would appear to be kumri, reported in the Scinde Horse detachments. These horses rapidly developed complete paralysis of the hind legs and died within ele \ en days. Distribution .—The first three of these diseases are consider* ed to be confined to an area bounded by a line drawn from theSiahKuh to Lash Juwain, thence to Alili on the Khash Rud, from there by Amiran and Sar-u-tar to Chehar Burjak; from this point to the Shilag and along the western shore of the Hamun to the Siah Kuh. Cause .—The local talent is most emphatic in attributing the first three of these diseases to the Sistani flies. After flood years the flies are very numerous, and the amount of illness correspondingly great. The flies appear to come from the rank undergrowth of tamarisk jungle, and from the edge of the Hamun; thus, where the jungle is scanty, or civilization has increased, the fly becomes less numerous, and the disease therefore less pre valent. The flies are met with in great numbers on the dasht, and this is accounted for by saying that they are blown there by the wind, and accompany animals leaving the jungle. They consider all the varieties equally harmful and protect their ani mals with light clothing, particularly covering the abdomen. Glanders is said to have been very common some years ago, but recently to have died out. diseases, Sistan is notoriously unhealthy for camels. The chief causes of the mortality are— (1) Pneumonia (Sistani sickness), (2) Influenza. (3) Sudden death at graze (poisonous plants ?), (4) Surra, (5) Severity of weather.Camels remain healthy on the Nushhi trade route up to Robdt. The sickly area seems confined to the oasis watered by the Helmand delta, and the river valley up to Rudbar. (1) Pneumonia is confined to the Helmand delta. It ap pears generally in early autumn, sometimes late July or early August, and lasts till January. The greatest mortality occurs in October, November and Decemberi Cause.- SistanTs attribute the disease to the flies and also the dust on camel grasses getting into the h ngs. The disease is fatal with extraordinary rapidity. Animals are well* ill and dead in a feiv days. Their lungs are found to be in an advanced stage of pneumonic inflammation; . Recoveries are rare. Most marked symptoms are difficulty m breathing* choking* a watery discharge from the nose* swelling m the throat* often loss of appetite and probably high tempera ture. The disease is violently epidemic* segregation is of little use* October appears to be the worst month. (2) Influenza is reported in the form of short but very vio lent epidemics* which cause a loss of probably 50 per cent. An epidemic of extraordinary severity, lasting 12 days , which occurred m January 1904, was not confined to Sistan,- but broke out simultaneously over an immense tract of Eastern Rersia. It was not attributed to severe weather* Preventive measures.-—Isolation ; the ground occupied at night changed daily and tamarisk shelters against the cold wind* Symptoms.-—-The course of the disease is extremely rapid, in two to four days the animal generally dies. The animal first refuses to graze or eat, then a discharge from the nose begins, white somewhat viscid mucous, and quickly becoming profuse. The nostrils and wind-pipe appeat choked with this profuse secretion. The camel at once gets weak and unable to move and generally has a great rise of tem perature. Treatment.—Hot fomentations, firing, and injection of black pepper into the nostrils, occasionally appeared to do good. A few cases survived the epidemic in January 1904, but eventually died, Total losses were 38 per cent.126 (5) Svdden deaths at gfaze. Throughout the year many camels of the Boundary Commission died at graze, the cause was not apparent. Slstanls attribute these deaths in the summer to the white foamy exudation from the camel thorn. The over- luxuriant grazing may be the cause. The deaths were much fewer in January, February and March; wheti the grazing was practically exhausled and the camels were fed principally on bhusd. These cases may perhaps be due td poisondus plants. (4) Surra and deaths from debility. That surra is endemic in Sistan is undoubted, hence; in spite of the splendid grazing, numbers of camels become debilitated after arrival in Sistan, and gradually die off; especially with severe weather ahd hard work. {5) Severity of weather. Blizzards constitute one of the great est drawbacks to keeping camels in Sistan, causing great mor tality. Camels weakened by any cause succUmb at once. More detailed information on the above will be found in the appendix to the Military Report on Sfstan, also notes obtained from Baluchis on plants poisonous to camels and the local temedies for the sameiTotal population 7,653,600 CHAPTER III. Ethnography. The origin of Medo-Persians was probably the same aa that of- the natives of India. At least as far back as 1000 B.C., the ancestors of the Persians and Indians were an Aryan race, originating in the country afterwards known as Bactria, from which they migrated. One stream swept south-east into India, another south-west ipto Persia. Plato describes the Persians as originally a nation of shepherds and herdsmen, occupying a rude country such as naturally fosters a hardy race of people, capable of supporting both cold and hardships, and, when need ful, of epduring the toils of war. Over these ancient settlers - during a lopg course qf centuries swept wave after wave pf conqupring invaders, each of whom left their mark on the original race. The result is the Persian of the present day, qf whom those inhabiting the northern parts of the country naturally show more of the characteristics of the invaders from Central Asia, while to the soqth-west the Arab element predominates. The nomad mountain tribes are the only ones who have had a chance qf preserving their individuality, though the people of Ears pride themselves op the purity of their origin, which is proved by their complexion and features. The total population is now placed in round numbers at 10,000,000. In 1884 General Schindler, who is the best authority on the subject, calculated the population as follows;— Families. Souls. 90 towns containing Villages and districts without 363,630 .. or 1,963,800 3,780,000 towns. Nomads 381,960 .. or 1,909,800123 Lord Curzon points out that these figures are clearly con jectural in many respects, as for an exact estimate no reliable data are obtainable. He suggests | per cent, per annum as a reason able allowance for increase. Calculating on this Towns Villages Nomads Total .. 10,306,848 This would give about 16 inhabitants to the square, mile, bub it must be remembered that there are in Persia immense tracts tf desert and great ranges of barren mountains, which are unsuited to human existence and practically uninhabited. A small scale map of Persia is apt to be misleading. From this any one accus tomed to the numerous villages of India might imagine Persia to be similarly populated. This is not the case. In highly favoured spots there certainly may be clusters of villages, but in many districts 16 miles between villages is not uncommon. The fact being that the population is so sparse, that nearly every village, however small and poor, can in some districts be shown on a small-scale map. The population may he roughly divided then into; — (1) Urban 2,650,000. (2) Rural 5,100,000. (3) Nomad 2,550,000. The numbers are only approximate. The first two classes are composed chiefly of Tajiks, Jews and Armenians. Tajiks or Tajaks are a Persian-speaking tribe of Iranian stock and are found in many parts of Central Asia. In the present day, in Persia, the name applies to the settled and more civilised Persian-speaking lowlanders, in contradistinction to the dialect-speaking highlanders, such as Kurds, Lurs, etc. In towns they are traders and artisans, in the country tillers of the soil, etc., and all in Persia are by religion Shf’ahs, clsewherq generally Sunijs, basis would give the population for 1910 2,644,584 5,090,400 2,571,864129 The Persian peasantry and nomad tribesmen are of good physique, but townsfolk and most people of good family are the reverse. The Persians are not now high-spirited and warlike they are crushed by conquest and bad government, and their brams and manhood are being sapped by excessive consumption of opium, and by vice. They are not frugal, but like to eat and dress well, however poor they may be. ^ ie T, reV0 * U ^ 01 ^ ^ P ers * a a ff° r ds an excellent object-lesson The Persian on the character of the people, and shows up the lamentable eXpimed bv lack or at any rate the feebleness, of the popular spirit, and theTevofuUon- displays also the fact that Persia is not merely a house divided ary movemei ' t ‘ against itself, but a rickety structure, kept together by external pressure, which every kind of domestic discussion tends to rend to pieces. Wild semi-nomad tribes, in every part of the kingdom, are ready at any moment to disown allegiance to the central government, and can be restrained by nothing but force and fear. The Mullas of the Shl’ah religion, are reaction ary and dread anything that may weaken their prerogatives or dispel the superstition of the masses; they, therefore, deprecate the spread of civil rights and liberties to their bond slaves. The governing and upper classes were all reactionaries and royalists being steeped in corruption, and having battened for centuries on such ill-gotten gams, as an iniquitous system of government allowed them to squeeze out of the masses. Persians are an emotional people, quick to seize upon a new idea or doctrine and their subtle active brains render them peculiarly susceptible to the influence of any kind of sentimental or abstract teaching- hence a Persian crowd is easily manipulated by a demagogue! bo it follows that a few enthusiasts of the younger generation, yho had imbibed western ideas of freedom and constitutional rights, experienced little difficulty in exciting an enthusiasm ol popular feeling, at least momentary and spasmodic. Thus during the nationalist movement, at one time a fanatical populace was clamouring for a constitution and abolition oi noary wrongs, and at another was acquiescing, almost without a murmur, in the cannonading of its national assembly or the arrival of foreign troops to restore order. Characteristics sucn as these are insufficient to bring about a successful revolution but afford a magnificent field for the machinations of agitator and adventurers. The success of the constitutional movement was thus largely due to the adroit use of such imflammable130 Local tribes. material by a few bold leaders (mostly aliens), who supplied the necessary courage, resolution and practical ability, which the Persian patriots lacked. As to any hopes that in the future Persia may groAv strong and independent enough to conduct her own administration, with her own trained and proven leaders, two obstacles stand in the way. The first is the lamentable vanity so marked in the Persian character which precludes them seeking or ensuing a good example. Up to a point they may appreciate, or even imitate, what other nations have achieved The dogged unswerving persever ances of the Japanese, as also their capacity to select the best in modern civilisation, seem alike to be beyond the scope of the present-day Persians. The other obstacle is the reactionary Shi’ah religion, with its vested interests, its fanaticism, and its hatred of progress and modern enlightenment. Local tribes are many and various. Certain nomad tribes have discarded their former habits, and become absorbed into the mixed population of the country. For example, one of the finest regiments in the Persian army was named Arab- u-’Ajam (Arab and Persian). This was recruited from the Shahrud-Bustan district, whose population is chiefly Arab, Persian and some Turkish races, completely fused into one. These regiments were celebrated for their valour. In Azarbaijan, where there is a mixed population of Turks, Kurds and Armenians, the Turks are in the ascendant, and are pushing out the Armenians and, to a small extent, the Kurds. In Talish the tribes resemble the Lesghis of Daghistan, continually marauding and murdering, brave and devoted to their chiefs, active, patient of fatigue, but treacherous, merciless and rapacious towards everyone else. Sabians or Subba or Sabi. Habitat, Turkish and Persian ’Arabistan. They claim Syrian origin, are dispersed in small communities, but united everywhere by a peculiar religion of their own. They resemble Arabs in dress and appearance, and show great aptitude for working in gold and silver.

Habitat, Dashtistan, Gulf littoral of Pars, from a point 40 miles south-south-east of Bushire, for 65 miles. Various tribes of Arab descent, numbering about 20,000,'Shi’ahs, speak lersian, more civilised than their northern neighbours, the Tangistanis, more peaceful and comparatively amenable, agriculturists, sailors, fishermen. Nearly all labourers and boatsmen in Bushire town are Dashtis. The inhabitants of Shamil, around and eastward from Bandar ’Abbas, some 25,000 souls, are Persians mixed with Baluch and Arab, speak Persian, mostly Shi’ahs, weak, peaceable, and oppressed; as cultivators idle and thriftless; fishermen and boat men ; possess practically no arms. The people of Bampur are a mixed race and inferior to ordinary Baluch, show traces of negro blood, and are rude and uncivilised, hashakardis. Habitat, east of Bandar ’Abbas, miserable, diseased, cowardly people, showing traces of African blood. Arbdbis. Habitat, Baluchistan, Bampur, and Sarhad dis tricts ; great cultivators, despised as cowards, talkative, village dwellers, occupy subject position. They are remnants of the old inhabitants of the land. The inhabitants of Persian Makran number about 114,000. Fighting strength 3,000, armed with Martini, or magazine rifles ; possibly 10,000 possess arms of sorts. All adults are armed,* except fishermen and herdsmen. Mostly Sunnis; character peaceable. They speak a Baluchi dialect called Makranl. The inhabitants of Persian and Afghan Sistan are identical gitUn. from an ethnographical point of view. Both are a medley of heterogenous races and tribes, Persian, Arab, Turkish, Baluch, Brahui, AfghSn, etc. None are important from a military point of View, They are not tribal units in the sense that headmen132 could place even a few hundred fighting men in the field or compel adherents to oppose a foreign occupation. The most important tribes are:— a 11 ® in fa ra ™ Baluchis who came originally from Baluchistan. Ail the laulci tribes owe allegiance to them, which makes them important. They occupy villages and wander along the .Helmand as far as the Chakansur district. Almost all Baluchi inhabitants of Slstan belong to the TaukI tribes; total number of families just under 2,000. Principal tribes Saruni, 450 families ; Jamalzai 300; Ourqich Nahrui, Baluchis settled in the villages of Khwaja Ahmad and Jalalabad. They number only 400 families, but are important, because the daughter of one of their two chiefs married the governor of Slstan. Sarbandl, 3,000 families scattered all Shahrahl, about 1,000 families. over the country. Kaiam, the tribe of the ancient royal family of Slstan, almost extinct, only 100 families.

There is no religious feeling in Sistan, nor antagonism between sects. Priestly and religious classes exercise considerable influence and are men of authority. The whole population is miserably poor and ground down by revenue exaction. The greater portion are content to subsist on water-melons as long as the supply lasts, and beg, borrow or steal for the rest of the year. The export from Persia of grain and gM is prohibited, so these are of little value, and for want of an open market are left buried till they rot. The Sistanis have been down-trodden for centuries and are generally liars or thieves with no independence of character; their only means of defence are cunning and assumed ignorance. The country swarms with robbers patronised by leading men, who share profits. The Sistani, if encouraged, is cheerful and willing to work. He has a sharp intellect, is easy to teach, has a sense of humour and is easy to control. His chief imple ment is a sharp adze-like spade which he uses with extraordi nary skill for everything. Sistanis are unsurpassed for skill in earth-work, especially canal digging. They are not courageous generally, but fear no danger in water, from flooded rivers, etc. They are patient and enduring in blizzards, heat, or thirst, and have done good service in the supply and transport corps ; with encouragement and assistance, much might be made of them. Opium eating and smoking is the curse of all the better class es; of these the military are the worst offenders, being opium- sodden and worthless. The lower classes are but little affected by this vice. Khorasan is inhabited by a great variety of races, only the Khorasan. portion lying near the northern and southern roads from Meshed to Tehran is occupied by Persians. The remainder in the northern districts are nomads, Turkomans, Kurds and Baluchis. Around Kirman and Yazd, the Arab element begins to appear, while the whole of the inhabitants in the south and east of Khorasan are chiefly of Arab blood.134 Kestorians. Armenia asi The Nestorian Christians of the Turko-Persian highlands are variously estimated from 100,000 to 200,000. The greater num ber are Turkish subjects, but some 44,000 are located in Azar- baljan. They do not accept the name Nestorian, nor the origin attributed to them, viz., the descendants of the sect founded by Nestorius, Patriarch of Constantinople, excommunicated and banished for heresy, A. D. 431. They claim to be the spiritual progeny of St. Thomas and St. Jude; and, while they call themselves Syrians, are styled by the Moslems Nazarenes. Their language is an ancient Syriac dialect intermingled with Arabic, Kurdish, Turkish and Persian words. The reigning patriarch is called Mar Shimun, and is always chosen from the same family, but the maliks no longer obey him, and his spiritual authority is also much weakened. Nestorians of the plains are robust, broad-shouldered men with open countenances, fair complexion and frequently red beards. Those from the mountains are wild and uncouth, often indistinguishable from the Kurds with whom they are at deadly enmity. Each attack and rob the other, but the Kurds, being stronger and better-armed, are usually the aggres sors. Nestorians, being a subject Christian population in a Mu hammadan country, have to take their share of all the petty persecutions, class and social drawbacks, etc., which always fall to the lot of Christians in such eases; but, on the whole, thanks to foreign influence, their lot is no harder than the rest of the Shah’s subjects. The Armenian element was introduced into Persia in 1G04, when Shah ’Abbas I laid waste Armenia and forcibly removed 40,000 of its inhabitants to Isfahan and Azarbaijan. To-day there are in Persia over 50,003, living principally in Tabriz, Khoi, Salmas, Urumieh, Mafagheh, Tehran, Hamadan Julia, Shiraz, Bushire, Rasht, Enzali, the province of Earidan and in some of the villages of the Chehar- mahal and neighbourhood. Their language is a dialect of the original Armenian tongue with a large admixture of Turkish and Persian words. There are a few wealthy merchants among them, but the majority are poor agriculturists. The doctrines of Christians of the Armenian Church differ slightly from those of the orthodox Greek Church. They are men of peace,_ The population of Julfa (suburb of Isfahan) is about 2,500, of which 80 per cent, are Armenians. Here they are a poor oppress ed race, unprincipled, mean and addicted to drink and are looked down upon by the Isfahanis as a race apart. In Hamadan, on the other hand, they are hardworking and respectable, if occasion ally drunkards and are regarded by the Persians as friends and good citizens. It has been calculated that in Azarbaljan there are some 30,000 Armenians. In this province they are described as less attractive and even less reliable than the mendacious Nes- torians. They travel a good deal, pick up revolutionary ideas and are disposed to deceit and turbulence. The Armenian question is much more a Turkish than a Persian one. Jews are found in nearly all towns in Persia ; but it is only Jews, in the larger cities, such as Tehran, Isfahan, Yazd, Shiraz, Hamadan, etc., that regular communities exist w ith priests and synagogues. They have in former years been occasionally victims of fanatical outbursts. Their numbers are variously estimated from 20,000 to 30,000. In Hamadan there are 5,000. Here are the reputed tombs of Esther and Mordecai. As a community Persian Jews are sunk in great poverty and ignorance. In Isfahan, where they occupy a comparatively better status than elsewhere, they are not allowed to wear the Persian head-dress, and suffer many disabilities. In Shiraz they are very badly oh, but in Bushire they are prosperous and free from persecution. In Yazd there are about 1,000. Parsl is the Indian name for the Zoroastrians. The Persians Parsis or call them Oabr, which means ungodly. They number about Qubrs - 10,000, and reside principally in Kirman, Yazd and 22 neigh bouring villages, (where there are 7,000) and in Tehran. They are good citizens, humble, honest and generous, especially to their own people, industrious, intelligent, and faithful to their religion. They have suffered much from persecution, and to this day are under many disabilities from the Muhammadans. (See Chapter T, 6-11 A. I), when the Arabs overthrew the Zoroastrian religion, and its priests were ail slaughtered or fled to India and China.) The nomad tribes are very important from a military Nomads, point of view, because they furnish the best fighting materialof the Khan of the tribe and subaltern officers, the man receives very little of it. Their elders are much respected and govern the small communities. Government does not allow these tribes to remove from one province to another without permission. Encampments consist generally of 20 to 30 tents. These are of rough construction and dark-coloured. Their mode of life is very simple, and their wants are few. They break up their winter encampments one month after the festival of Nau-Ruz, which takes place on the 21st March, when the sun enters the sign of Aries, and travel slowly to what they call the Sarhad or boundary between the cold and hot region ; they stay here a month, and again move on to their Yailaq, where they remain about 70 days during the summer heat, returning then to the Sarhad for another month, and finally reaching again the Kishlaq for the winter. They are soldiers by nature, but difficult to discipline owing to their clan-like propensities. On the frontiers of both Turkey and Russia, clandestine migration takes place, especially among the Kurds. Good legislation would turn these nomads into peaceable industrious communities, but under the present regime, the vast regions inhabited by them must continue mere waste tracks, adapted solely for armed shepherds, and free booters. Nearly the whole of South-West Persia is peopled by Iliats. A foreign race, they are prone to rebellion, and, if assisted from abroad, would not submit to Persia. They are good raw material for troops. The Persian irregular cavalry is chiefly recruited from them. Individually they are excellent horsemen and skilful in the use of arms, but they cannot act in unison. Their officers are no better trained in tactical know ledge than the rank and file, and the troops being commanded by their own local chief, family jealousies prevent a unity of feeling and purpose. Iliat cavalry horses are sent out under a small guard to graze whenever possible; otherwise their feed is daily 7 lbs. barley and 14 to 20 lbs chopped straw, exactly what chdrvdddrs give their mules on the march. Iliats can also supply good infantry, especially the Bakhtiari. These tribes are ignorant of everything except tending flocks, weaving and martial exercises. They are taught to despise peaceful occupations. They are inured to danger and fatigue, tenacious of the honour of their tribe, and were regarded until138 lately as the prop and glory of Persia. In the field they were ubiquitous, and hovering round an enemy, never allowed him to rest. The government is now jealous of their power and draws less on them for recruits. Such troops are apt to be lawless and savage marauders and dangerous to weak authority. The cavalry are more esteemed than the infantry, only because it is considered degrading to walk, and Iliats are accustomed to ride from childhood. It has sometimes been the policy of government to split up unruly and dangerous tribes, and transport them to distant parts of the empire. Only under the guidance of a powerful, trusted and disinterested agency, capable of suppressing all petty jealousies, can combination be looked for. A foreign power alone, among Asiatics, can play the part of a trusted agency. Ihe only policy of the Persian rulers is to accumulate wealtn during precarious terms of office; they have no patriotism nor high aims. The Turkish tribes on the Turko-Persian frontier are especially noted for their predatory habits, and, if Sunnis, are particularly abnoxious to the Persian Shi’ah. The Turkish tribes are found chiefly in the north and north-west of Persia, but a few tribes also inhabit the south-eastern provinces. Kindred races are the Osmanlis or subjects of the Sultan of Turkey, the Tartars of Russia and Siberia, the Kirghiz of Central Asia, the Uzbegs of Khiva, Bokhara and Fargana, and the Turkomans of Transcaspia. The language of the Persian Turks is the Turk! dialect, a modified form of that spoken in Turkey. They are a warlike people and furnish the best Persian soldiers. Leading and characteristic tribes : 1. Kizil Bash (Red Heads). A general name for a powerful combination of 32 tribes. To break the power of these the Shdhsavand tribes were organised by Shah ’Abbas I in the first quarter of the 17th century. They were granted the distinction of a peculiar head-dress, for assisting the accession of Sha i Ismail. The more important Kizil Bash tribes are: - (a) Afshdr who settled in Persia in the 16th century. Habitat Azarbaljan, Urumieh, Sain Kaleh, Arda- bil, Mish Mazanduran, Khurasan, ’Iraq, Pars andKirman. Some 12,000 families. They have mostly discarded their nomad ways and live in towns and villages. About 14,000 are on active service in the Persian cavalry, and they could probably produce 15,000 well-armed horsemen. Except for dress, they resemble ordinary Persians. Loquacious and flatterers, they yet have the makings of good soldiers, but are quarrelsome, thievish, and addicted to drink. {b) Baidt, who came with Jengiz Khan. Habitat, mostly north of Burujird and Khurramabad, some in Ears and Khorasan, and some have joined the Qajar tribe. (c) DMcUcadr. Habitat Azarbaljan : very few remain. (d) Qd)dr. Habitat Mazandaran, Astarabad and Tehran. The royal tribe of Persia, to which the reigning Shah of Persia belongs. They number about 10,000 families, in 12 divisions. (e) Shamlu. Name signifies Syrian, as they came ori ginally from Syria. This tribe now exists as part o' the A f sliars, and as part of the Shahsavands, while a number of them, some 2,500 families] have formed a separate tribe called Bahdrlu, half of whom live in Ears, and the remainder in Azarbaijan. 2. Shdhmvan. Habitat, chiefly Azarbaljan, and the great central plateau, or old province of ’Iraq-i-Ajami. Oiigin- ally banded together to break the power of Kizil Bash tribes • taeir name signifies “ Shah loving ”* They are divided into ‘During the nve main branches, which do not seem to have anv close tribe 1 revolution of relations.

They might also re . tired on the produce 2,000 fighting men, half of whom would Russian troops, he mounted, and armed with nondescript rifles. {b) Ainallu are said to number 10,000 families, with 1,300 fighting men mounted and armed.140 (c) Afshar have about 6,000 families and 1,000 fight ing men. These should properly be with the Kizil Bash tribe. (d) Duirdn. 6,000 families and 700 men, mounted and armed. (e) Kurdbaiglii. 7,000 families and 1,600 men, mounted and armed. In the Russo-Persian War, 1826, the Shalisavands joined the Russians. 3. Qdr-gazlii. Habitat, Hamadan and to the north-east for 30 miles. 5,000 families. Came originally from Syria with the Shamlu tribe. One of the bravest and most warlike tribes of Persia. 4. Kara Pafdk. Habitat, Kirmanshah. Fine horsemen, and furnish 400 cavalry to Government. 6. Qdshqdi. Habitat, scattered over Pars : in the winter the Garmsvr, in summer the highlands between Isfahan and Shiraz. They resemble Bakhtiaris and Kuhgalus in manners, customs and features. Number about 10,000 tents: agricultural as well as a pastoral people and famous for their cattle. The men are light, hardy, active, warlike, and good riders and shots. They could also furnish good infantry and can produce between one and two thousand horsemen, armed with rifles, mostly Martinis. The Qdshquli branch of the Qashqais occupy the country east of Behbehan in the winter, and the highlands between Kazarun and Abadeh in the sum mer. Their chief is Muhammad ’All Khan, who lives at Kazarun. 6. Kara Kuin Lu. Habitat, near Baft. 150 families, only noteworthy as the remnants of the tribe, from which sprang the ‘ ‘ Black Sheep ’ ’ Turkoman Dynasty. 7. Gukldn, Habitat, head of the Gurqdn river, non-nomadic Turkomans: 2,000 families : are well mounted, but not parti cularly manly ; have taken largely to opium smoking: are cultivators, and very dirty, lazy and live in constant dread of the Yamuts, and in constant strife with their other neigh bours. 8. Qarai. Habitat, Turshiz and Turbat-i-Haidari districts. 3,000 families, village dwellers, but accounted warlike. Regi ments recruited from them have a high reputation.9. Yamut. Habitat, banks of the G Arean and Atrak rivers, and as far north as Balkan and Krasnoyodsk. About 80,000 families of Turkomans. Some 7,000^tenfcs in the Atrak district 5 remainder under Russia in Khiva territory. Divided into Sharif and Chum Yamuts. Former 4,750 families, latter 2,250 families. Those possessing herds of camels, cultivating, dwelling in fixed abodes, and paying revenue are called Chumur. The remainder who possess cattle, horses and flocks, move about for pasturage, have summer and winter camps, and evade revenue, are called Chdrva. The former are the more numerous. The Yu raids acknowledge no authority, and have no head men ; owing to this, tribal feuds are rife. They are armed with Berdan rifles, profess to be religiously inclined, treat Saiyids with great respect, are hospitable, never rob a guest and are upright in their dealings. The Persian Government has already enlisted Yamut Turkoman levies. Ordinary Persian troops are not fit to bo entrusted with garrisoning Turkoman countries. A Govern or to control this tribe would much improve matters. They have nine tribal divisions. Of these the most numer ous are the Jajarbai habitat, from the mouth of the Gurgan and through the Aleh-Dagh and Sina-Dagh. Some 3,000 families. Large owners of camels, sheep and cattle. The Chumur are the best of this division and are sailors, fishermen and traders. They live and dress well and are civilized. Raids and thefts are unknown. They would prefer to be under Russian protection. The Aghurjurll, on the other hand, who live at ChikishlTar and the mouth of the Atrak, are Russian subjects and dislike being so. They are import ant, because they were originally pirates and are still sailors and would afford good material for manning the ships on the Caspian. Kurds are illiterate and bigoted Sunnis, not really Kurds, fanatical, but become bigoted from daily contact with a Shi’ah people. The root of the Persian-Kurdish question is religious hatred between Sunnis and Shi’ahs and the root of the Turko-142 Kurdish question is hatred between Muhammadans and Christians. The language of the majority is Kurmanju, an old Persian patois with some foreign words. In Kurdistan and Kirmanshah the Guran dialect is spoken, which resem bles modern Persian. Most Kurds are sedentary and pastoral, and so far nomad ic that they move during the summer months to the hills above their settled villages. Genuine nomads are largely Turkish subjects, or live on the Turkish border, and these are probably the wealthiest class, the others being deplorably ignorant and poor. Dissensions and clan feuds weaken them and prevent them resisting the Persians, and in them an invader would find auxiliaries rather than enemies. Con- sidering the nature of the country this is important. In 1880 they attempted an abortive rebellion, which showed the im practicability of united Kurdish organization, owing to family and clan dissensions. Persian Kurds are celebrated for hospital ity, and are not unfriendly to Europeans. They are fond of showy dress, always carry arms, and are big handsome men. The administration of Kurdistan, such as exists, is genu inely feudal. The Kurds are scarcely taxed at all; but the Aghds, or chiefs, are expected to furnish armed contingents, when called upon by Government or local Governors. These contingents are generally maintained in the field by the chiefs at their own expense, if within the limits of Kurdistan, and cost Government nothing. A drum is beaten in the villages, and the villagers at once repair to the meeting place with their rifles. This system has great possibilities if pro perly worked ; but the Persian Government has never been able to make the most of the valuable material it possesses in Kurdistan. By continual exactions and persecutions it drives the Kurds to revolt, and, on the other hand, is incapable of displaying, when necessary, a wise severity towards turbulent tribesmen. The result is that the Kurds 'dislike the Persian officials, despise their cowardice, and only respect their authori ty from fear of the Government behind them. The Persians have talked lately about disarming the Kurds, an absurd and impracticable suggestion as the Kurds would never acquiesce. An attempt at restraining their brigandage is certainly most necessary. The development of the armed feudal system,under tactful and capable Persian Governors would be far more advantageous to Government than general disarmament. What is necessary is to free the Kurds from exactions of officials, give the chiefs greater responsibility, and thus interest them in the preservation of order; and to protect them from their own extravagance, and from usurers, who, by ruining them, drive them to brigandage. Their marauding instincts re quire to be checked, but their warlike education encouraged. They pay ridiculous sums for good rifles, and their improvi dence and ignorance of business make them an easy prey to the usurer. The fighting qualities of the Kurds are highly estimated. They ride and shoot from childhood, are very enduring, and hold human life cheap. They are incapable of sustained oper ations in the field, being undisciplined, and prone to scat ter with, or in search of, loot; but for defensive or guerilla war fare in their own country they are magnificent. Save for perpetual Kurdish blood feuds and Kurdish jealousy of one another, the Persian Government could never hold that country. The Turkish frontier officials are constantly stirring them up against the Persian Government, and violating all international formalities. Expert opinion states that the Kurds do not wish to be transferred to Turkey, but prefer the easy-going Persian Government to the more rigid Turkish administration. Moreover the Turks have held out extravagant hopes to them, which they were unable to satisfy; and, consequently, the Kurds are now more favourably disposed towards the Persian authorities. Although Kurds like and welcome Europeans, they would be quite ready to kill them, should it by chance suit their purpose. They regard the English as rather an aristocratic race, who do not indulge in shady commercial transactions or political intrigue. Being themselves a race of riders and marks men, they admire the English, because in these respects they consider them more proficient than other Western peoples. The Russians are not very popular, because they protect Christians and Russian subjects, who, profiting by the native extra vagance of the Kurds, become oppressive money-lenders, and the Russian officials invariably support these usurers in their exorbitant demands. Thus the English are considered more honest than the Russians,144 : The present state of Kurdistan is one of administrative chaos, and any order there may be, is due solely to the for bearance of the Kurds, and to their internal divisions, which make them chary of a revolt against a Government capable of playing off one tribe against another. In 1910, some of the chiefs of the Turkish Kurds, dis satisfied with the severity of the young Turk Government and alarmed by the threats of disarmament, made overtures for settlement in Maku. The Persian Government discouraged this immigration. Maku, from its situation, being of extreme strategic importance to Russia, the Khan there is more cr less under Russian protection, and the Russians do not at all wish to see Turkish influence there increased by an influx of Turkish Kurds. Should the Turkish Government at any time decide to disarm their Kurds, the result would be an immediate immigration of large numbers to Persia, and the Persian Government would be able, perhaps, to induce the Turks to adopt a more reasonable attitude on the frontier question, and not to support rebellious Persian Kurds. On the other hand, there would be a great increase in lawlessness in Persian Kurdistan, with which the Persian Government would be incapable of coping. skins, info ft . iiiiiand raiding : : «*lit i PjMmd.

(b) Haidardnlu. Habitat, Kara Aineh, on the western fron* tiei of Azarbaljan. 500 families are Persian subjects; a largo number are Turkish. They are at constant enmity with the Jelalis. (7) Jafs.

They levy blackmail and are fierce and unruly, vv hen molested they escape across the frontier. . W J Malls. Habitat, winter, under Mount Ararat; summer, rodiMS migratory. 920 tents in 7 clans. During the Russo-Turkish war (1877 78) 2,000 of their horsemen held the frontier in the inter ests of Russia against T u kish Kurds. In that war they cap- atelies dired a number of rifles, so now every man carries a Martini or the!!* Berdan. (9) Kalhur. Habitat, province of Kirmanshah. 6,365 tents. Partly nomads, who move in summer to mountains north-west of the Pusht-i-Kuh. A small section 300 families, live in the Saqqiz district. They are tall, manly, strong146 and good shots, and own some 1,500 breech loading rifles, much transport and supplies. They are supposed to furnish a large military force to government, but in reality only supply 100 infantry and 200 cavalry. They are always ready to take refuge in Turkish territory and it is very doubtful if the Persian government could trust them in time of need. (10) Mikrl. Habitat, southern Azarbaijan. A sedentary tribe numbering about 2,000 families. They could probably put 1,500—2,000 horsemen in the field. Being Sunnis it is doubt ful if they would support the Persians in case of a Russian invasion; a little management in playing on their cupidity and religious feelings would make them very useful auxiliaries to Russia. They are fine horsemen, carry lances and shields, fight well, and are of good physique; though half savage, they are open in their intercourse with strangers and have no prejudice against Christians. They speak Kurdish, but understand Per sian and Turkish. On one occasion they totally defeated a body of Russian cavalry. Kurds, in Khorasan. (11) Milan. Habitat, winter, Aras river; summer, Turkish frontier. They number some 400 tents ; are on bad terms with the Jelalls. Physically they are fine hardy men, and arc said to be most courageous. They are armed with Martinis or Berdans. (12) Saqqiz, Habitat, some 15,000 or more inhabit the town of Saqqiz. They are hospitable, fairly civilised, and own many horses; they ride well, and are always armed witn rifles of Werndl, Martini, or Russian small bore pattern, or r. of local manufacture. There are now some 50,000 Kurds in Khorasan. They were originally brought there by Shah Ismail to chec ur'o man inroads. They are notorious for thieving and plundering. The most noteworthy are:— (1) Amdrlu. Habitat, north-west of Nishapur, in the Marush plain. 500 families, originally brought over by Nadir bna . They retain their own dialect and are Shi'ahs. (2) Shddillu. Habitat, Kuchan and Bujnurd; are vi dwellers, about IS.COOin number. They form a sort of mountedmilitia with 700 horse, of whom 100 are very well mounted. Arms are Berdan rifles ; dress similar to Russian Cossacks. These would make an admirable body of light Cavalry if armed proper ly and well disciplined. They are bold riders and very enduring. Some 300 foot militia, badly armed, act as road guards. About 3,000 fighting men could turn out, armed with native guns. The men are of fine physique and accustomed to con stant warfare against the Turkomans. They also check the Yamiit raids and protect the Guklans (3) Za'afardnlu. Habitat, Kuchan. A fine, robust, well- clothed and well-housed race, reported to be brave, hos pitable, honest and of independent bearing. Laics are nomads dispersed throughout the country Laks. chiefly about Kazvin and in the provinces of Ears and Mazan- daran. They are a very large tribe,, subdivided into many families ,and are of Persian descent, claiming according to tradi tion, origin from the Kaianian dynasty. The Zends, the tribe of the famous Karim Khan, were Laks, and one and all are re nowned for being thieves. Part of the tribe are ’ All-illahls. Their total numbers are reckoned at some 20,000 families, some living in cities, some in the open. The L’/rs appear to belong to the same ethnical group as the Lur3 - Kurds. They are probably of aboriginal, old Aryan, or Iranian stock, and have lived for centuries in their present habitat. They may conveniently be classified as follows:— (i) Faili Lurs, followers of the Vali of Pusht-i-Kuh. (ii) Lurs of Pish Kuh. (Hi) The Bakhtiari. (iv) Other sections who have wandered far afield, as the Mamassani and Kuhgalu tribes. Their language is almost identical with that of their neigh bours, the Kurds of Kirmanshah. The religion of a large number is the ’Ali-illahi persuasion. Some are orthodox Muhammadans. They are a simple-minded people, wiry and en during. The men seem to consider robbery and war their proper occupation, and are never so pleased as when engaged in a foray. They inhabit the mountainous districts of western and148 Bakhtlaris. south-western Persia around Khurramabad, Dizful and the Pusht-i-Kuh. European travellers among them have been on the whole well received ; but there have been cases of violence and robbery. They say they trust the word of the English and dislike and despise the Persians. (1) Faill. Habit :t, the Lur-i-Kuchak portion of Khuzistan. They are less united than the Bakhtiari and are divided into Pish Kuh (this side of the mountains) and Pusht-i-kuh (beyond the mountains). Total numbers about 56,000 families. Plsh-Kuh, some 39,550 families, are fairly under control, as each tribe or sub-division has its own particular head or Tushmdl. The latter has great authority and is held in much respect by the tribesmen ; he acknowledges no authority but the Shah, and that only when it suits him. The Faill are generally at war among themselves and be ing notorious robbers, their country is quite unsafe for travel and commerce. They pretend to respect an oath and to be less blood-thirsty than the Bakhtilris. They are supposed to muster between 4, 000 and 5,000 horse and 20,000 foot; but their internal feuds keep them disunited, which suits the Persian Government. Another reason that the latter does not really want the country reduced to order, is that the Karun river would be freely opened to navigation, and roads made through Luristan, in which case foreigners would obtain a footing in Shushtar and Eizful, enriching the Lurs and Arabs, who would then be come too strong for control.

These are the most important section of the Lurs; and are divided into {i) a northern division called Hajt Lang, residing in the Chehar Mahal and adjoining valleys and num bering about 36,000 families, and (ii) a southern division called Chehdr Lang, whose head-quarters are Kaleh-i-Tfil, poorer and more nomadic than the northern, and having about 11,000 tents. This would probably give a total population for the whole tribe of 235,000. Their character is a mixture of dignity and license; they are ostentatiously loyal to tribal ties, savage when excited, and adroit thieves. They are of good physique, but suffer from diseased eyes, caused chiefly by dirt. The number of fighting men is estimated at 50,000 but i= probably less ; about half of these are Pte ad jealous against an e J ^ Khans ^stfulof eacl ^ people, to e jjK Moreover T®. Contai ft ol race and Jo® and w&lt; ^ own countr enemy, a j “tapeo, are,trained to the use of firearms, of which they possess some 5,000 breech-loaders of very inferior description. About 10,000 mounted men are available. They are not efficient in a military sense, but would be invaluable to an European ally, for purposes of guerilla warfare in defending their mountain homes, as guides, mounted infantry, scouts, spies and for raid ing on the flanks of an army. The Khans recognize that their men are badly armed, and are too intelligent to offer useless re sistance to an invader from the north; but as auxiliaries, they would combine and use all their efforts to defend their country. At times their independence has been well nigh absolute. At the beginning of the 19th century a force of°3,000 Bakhtiari was raised by Major Hart, who found them orderly and tractable to him, but insubordinate and contemptuous to Persian officers. The Shah appoints the Ilkharii or chieftain, the Ilbegl or 2nd in command and the Hakim of the Chehar Mahal. The Bak i- tiari have always looked to England for protection, and friendly relations have usually existed hitherto; but no official pledges have been given. The Khans have concluded with the Shaikh of Muhammareh a formal alliance, declaring their intention to be loyal to Persia, as long as they are not unjustly interfered with ; otherwise to combine in resistance. After some misunderstandings and friction, the Khans are behaving more or less amicably in matters relating to Messrs. Lynch Brothers’ road from Ahwaz to Isfahan, and to the Anglo- Persian Oil Company. Latest accounts place their military value rather low, be cause they could not be kept long in the field ; their tribal dis putes and jealousies would prevent unanimity, or combina tion against an enemy, and they prefer bragging to fight ing. The Khans and the Shaikh of Muhammareh are too distrustful of each other, and have too little authority over their people, to ensure combined action for more than a few weeks. Moreover there is mutual dislike between Arabs and Bakhtiaris. Contact with the outer world has deprived them of pride of race and their ancient hospitality. They are very avaricious and would be useless for any fighting out of their own country. They dislike coming to close quarters with an enemy, always, like most Asiatics, want a safe line of retreat open, are devoid of a spirit of self sacrifice, talk about150 rather than practise tribal sentiment, and will serve the highest bidder. Familiarity with Europeans has not increased their respect for them. They would not make good road guards, unless under strict control, and w-ould be more formidable to wayfarers than robbers. They afforded a sample of their military value during their march on Tehran in 1909. After months of procrastination, defiance of their chief’s orders, wholesale robbery around Isfahan, and refusal to advance without being paid, about 1,700 reached Qum under Sardar As’ad, and would have gone no further, if the Sipahd&lt;ir and his Caucasian levies had not done all the serious fighting. On arrival in Tehran, they took the whole credit to themselves. (3) Kuhgalu. Habitat, Kuhgalu country north of Behbe- ban. They are disunited by bitter feuds, and anxious to open up friendly relations with the British, which might be advantageous, as a shorter road, from Ahwaz to Isfahan, 218 miles, a s compared with 276 by the Lynch road, exists through their country, and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s works are close to their frontier. Compared with the Bakhtiari, they are more roughly dressed, are infinitely better armed, more uncouth, more sav- age, and physically a finenrace, though in general characteristics they resemble them. They are without a written history, with out a literature, and uneducated and possess few tribal tradi tions. Their arts and crafts are few and primitive, their ad ministration is of the patriarchal form, and taxation is light. The Kuhgalu are divided into two main divisions:—• (a) The Chehar Barvclieh, and (6) the Lirdui. (a) The CbeMr Bamch h comprise 7,900 families, with a fighting strength of 8,600, including over 2,000 mounted men. Among these, the Btirair Ahmad are the most important sub-division ; they are brave, warlike and wealthy, and number 4,500 families with 3,000 footmen and 2,000 horsemen, well mounted and well armed. Next in importance is the Bdvi sub-division ; a wealthy agricultural and pastoral people of 2,000 families. (b) The L'ndvi number altogether 12,350 families, with 11,700 fighting men, of whom very few are mounted. The Bahmai sub-dnision numbers 2,500 families, with about 3,000 fighting men. They are reported to151 be wild and lawless, notorious robbers, ignorant, barbarous and treacherous. Their chief village is Badli. The , Ala-ud-D'n 1 , with 1,000 good fighting men are subject to the BahmaT. The Ta 'yibl Sarhaddi sub-division numbers 2,350 families, with 1,500 fight ing men, mounted and dismounted. They are good fighters, but wild and lawless and arrant thieves. They cause constant trouble on the Lynch road. They are considered the best armed and most intelligent of the Kubgalus. The Taiyibl Garmsirl sub-division con sists of about 1,250 families, with 2,000 armed men, of whom about 50 are mounted. They are wild, law less and predatory. About f of the Kuhgalu fighting men are armed with rifles, chiefly Martinis, with a few 5-shot German rifles, and a few British -303 rifles, the last-named being highly prized. Their country is unsafe for travellers and they are reckoned the most unruly of the mountaineers of Bars. There is enmity between the Kuhgalus. and the Bakhtiaris. (4) Mamassanl. Habitat, Shfdistan north of Kazarun. 2,600 families, in 5 sub-divisions, of which Rustam, 1,500 families, is the largest, and considered the bravest, and can turn out 200 well armed horsemen. They are a fine race with features of the ancient Iranian type. They speak the Bur dialect with local modifications. Formerly they were inclined to be friendly to the British and to look to them for protection against the Persian Government. (5) Lashdm. Habitat, northern shore of lake NlrTz. They live in mud forts in winter, and in tents close by in summer. Head quarters Abadeh. They number only about oOO families, but are noted robbers. They generally prefer to plunder at a distance from their tents, to which they retire with their booty. They ride well, scout admirably and would enlist on any side likely to offer them gain. The Persian Government has little control over them. (6) Jdnilci Sardslr. Habitat, Khiizhtan. Dependent on the Bakhtiarl. 3,000 families, who live in houses. They are not courageous nor good shots, but have 500—600 good horsemen.152 (7) D'narunis. Habitat, Malamlr p]a : n, Khuzistan. Number about 3,000. They are notorious thieves, good horse men and good shots. Controlled by the Bakhtiari. (8) Sagvand. Habitat, Abistan, Kilab, Pusht-i-Kuh and near Dizful. 3,000 families. They were originally Arabs Avho invaded the country, and were joined by many of the Lnr tribes they overcame. They are tent dwellers “and typical nomads and never remain long in one place. They are said to be able to turn out at least 1,000 horsemen, but practically i o footmen with rifles. ^ Ihe above may be taken as the typical and important tnbes 1 ut there are divisions and sub-divisions innumerable. There are also many separate tribes, among whom there seems to be no unity. There is, however, a powerful confederacy railed Dilfdn, among the Pish-Kuh Lurs united under a strong capable ruler, the Fath-i-Sultan, Nazar ‘All Khan. Their fighting strength is estimated at 18,000 to 20,000, well-armed and supplied with ammunition. The Arabs inhabit ’Arabistan as far north as Dizful, and the shores of the Persian Gulf. A few tribes dwell also’in Pars. There is a tribe, the Sarah, between Anarak and Kashan, who are great robbers; and some scattered tribes in Khorasan. Of these there is a settlement at Tabas brought there bv a Safavian King. The military value of the Persian Arab, fighting under his own leaders in his own country, is less than that of his fellows on the Turkish side, and has probably decreased of late years. There is however little reliable information on this head. They are mobile to a remarkable degree, whether on horse or foot, and are little hampered by questions of supply. They are fairly well armed, but want of practice makes them indifferent shots. The less well armed Bakhtiari are better shots. When Arab fights Arab, one side generally loses heart after a time and retires, though no decisive action may have been fought, or decisive range reached, nor serious losses sustain ed. The side which holds on longest and keeps together wins. They are faint-hearted and have no confidence in their leaders. Their democratic tendencies prevent their chiefs exactingobedience from them for long, unless it is to their advantage ; hence the Shaikh of Muhammareh has never yet gained a de cisive victory over his rebellious subjects west of the Karun. In spite of prohibitions, arms and ammunition are exten sively smuggled in from the Gulf and Turkish Arabia; only lack of money prevents every Arab possessing a modern rifle. At present the Shaikh of Muhammareh, in the event of mili tary operations, has to issue numbers of rifles and ammunition to the levies, so that without assistance he could not put more than 15,000 rifles in the field. Under certain circumstances, he would receive the assistance of some 5,000 armed men from tribes, who, although on the Turkish side, look to him as their tribal leader. The Muhaisin, Bani Turuf, and other of his tributary tribes west of the Karun might muster if inclined 10,000 armed men ; but would more likely be a source of weakness to him than strength. The Bani Lam and other tribes to the north have never fought under the Shaikh’s banner and are never likely to. The Arabs under his effective jurisdiction might raise about 25.000 men subject to some sort of control. Possibly, therefore, the Shaikh could put in the field, in south ’ Arabistan, at the most 30.000 men (including 15,000 mounted); an ill-trained undis ciplined rabble, badly armed and faint-hearted, which would be unlikely to offer serious resistance to an invading army. European instructors would no doubt improve matters. In northern’Arabistan the nomad Arabs are under a gover nor residing at Shushtar, though they obey the Shaikh in all ex ternal matters. These are the Al Kath r. Bait Sa'ad, and Bani Lim. The last named are potential enemies of the Shaikh and have never been under his control. The military value of these tribes is about on a par with that of the Shaikh’s followers. In Shushtar town and district the people are sedentary unwarlike, quarrelsome and fairly well armed. In Dizful town and district, although well armed, they are raided at will by the Sagvands, to whom they pay blackmad.154 The Arabs of Khuzistan are more intelligent, probably from intercourse with the subtle Persian. They have adopted many Persian customs and marry Persian women. There is how ever a general feeling of hostility between them and the Persians, especially among the lower classes. The control of the Persian Governor over Southern ’ Arabistan is nominal, the Shaikh of Muhammareh is almost independent of him and holds his appointment direct from the Shah. In most matters the Shaikh’s government is personal and extremely stringent. Headmen of tribes are called Khillait, not Shaikh, which title is reserved for the Shaikh of Muhammareh. Jl ley i toes.

They number about 16,000 fighting men, with nondescript rifles. At the present day they are partly Persianised and all Shi’ahs. They are not altogether settled, nor wholly nomadic ; but at an intermediate stage. They cul tivate lands and own herds and use canoes on inland waters. fflon tie Ki (i) Email. kGaigar.

An independent tribe politically allied to the Bavieh. 460 fighting men, half with rifles and 130 mounted. Tent dwellers. Large owners of horses, camels and flocks. (10) Anafijeh. Habitat, right bank of the Shatait, both banks of the Diz, right bank of the Karun. They weie once very powerful, but are now reduced to about 5,000. They can muster 1,400 fighting men, 150 mounted, mostly armed with lifles. flhis tribe is under the Shaikh of Muhammareh, butis believed to be related to the A1 Kathir tribe. Northern y Arabistdn. Leading tribes :—• (1) Al Kathir. Habitat, both banks of the Diz river near Shush. 3,000 families. Fighting men 2,300, all with rifles; 470 mounted. They intermarry with Persians. The control of the country and tribesmen is in the hands of their chief. (2) Bait Sa'd. — Habitat, both banks of the Diz river above the Anafijeh tribe, and also in Mianab, They are de-156 scended from Ja’far the Barmecide, who married an Arabian princess. About 4,000 families, 4,000 fighting men, including 250 mounted and owning over 3,000 rifles. (3) Bani Lam.—Habitat, l usht-i-Kuh to the left bank of the Tigris and Karkheh rivers. They are semi-independent and number 45,000. Fighting strength 15,000, a third mount ed, two thirds with rifles. They are agriculturists and tent dwellers and by religion Shi’ahs speaking both Persian and Arabic. Blood feuds are rigorously prosecuted. They are blindly -submissive to their chiefs, but troublesome to the Persian authorities, to whom they seldom pay revenue. They are reported to be predatory, but this is not strictly true. They are well supP lied with modern rifles and are good shots, espe cially from the saddle. This tribe is celebrated for the posses sion of exce^eut camels and horses. (4) Bani Hardan. Habitat, both sides of the boundary bet ween northern and southern ’Arabistan. A'umber 2,u00. Fighting men about 700, 200 with rifles and 200 mourned. In Fars are the ll Khamseh, consisting of 5 tribes, some of Turkish origin. Of these the ll 'Arab number 6,000 families, the Abut Vardi only 500 families, which include the chiefs of the whole confederacy. They are traders, and many of them have enlisted in the Shah's regiments. The Baharlu are Turk ish ; half the tribe reside in Azarbaijan. They have 500 armed horsemen, are of good physique and their women carry arms ; reputed to be robbers. They co-o i erated, in ls79, with Persian troops against the ll 'Arab. In the south-eastern corner of Bashtistan are the Damukh, a brave, ancient independent race of Arabs, now nearly exter minated. They are noted for their fine breed of horses ; are con nected with the Bahrain Arabs, and speak Arabic and Persian. Baluchis are spread over Persian Baluchistan, and about 1,000 families have wandered into Sistan and Kafn and 3,000 more into Khorasan. These communicate with their brethren in Baluchistan. They claim Arab descent, but are said to have immigrated originally from Aleppo in Syria. The Baluch organization is essentially feudal, and all power lies in the hands of the local chiefs, who are called Sarddrs or157 Min. The aristocratic families are chiefly Naush'irwdn's (of Arab descent), Rinds, Askdnls, and After Khdnzdis. The bulk of the population occupy a very subject position, and the sardars own numbers of ghuldms or slaves of both sexes. Some are so backward and degraded as to be little better than primitive savages. They are generally thieves, liars and swaggering boasters. Politically they have two feelings ; an in tense passion for tribal independence, with all its murderous accompaniments of blood feuds and border raids, and an out spoken dislike of the Persians, whom they call Gajars. For the British name and rule, on the other hand, they have a great respect, and would like to be taken under British protection. They are nominally Sunnis, but have practically no religion. Their villages are clusters of squalid huts round a central keep or fort where the chief resides. They derive their living generally from their date groves and agriculture. They speak a dialect of their own containing many Persian words. Leading -and characteristic tribes :— (1) Ddmanis or Ydrahmadzai. Habitat, chiefly south-east of Sarhad towards Jalk. About 1,000 families. 2,007 fighting men, with 1,832 rifles. They are inveterate raiders. Here also with them are the Ismdilzai, 800 families, and the RiJcis, 600 families. The probable total fighting strength is at most 3,000 men. They are badly armed, with little power of combination, and constantly at feud, with no idea of unity of action. They could be starved into submission by cutting off their grain supply from Sistan. (2) Ldshdris. Habitat, Lashar, south of Bampur plain. Taller and physically finer than ordinary Baluchis, they are warlike and independent, with frank appearance. Though nomadic they return to villages in the date season. (3) Flat Baluch. Habitat, Lashar south of Bampur down to Chahbar and the coast. Many of them are identical vith the Ldshdris, but large numbers are very nomadic, moving ail over the Bampur desert. They are fine wiry men of great endurance, and always ready to take the field against other tribes. Chehdr 'Amaq. Habitat. Herat district and Khorasan. Mixed tribes. They are tent dwellers, and the chief tribes are :— Timuri, 6,000 families, scattered about Meshed, Jam, Ba- Kharz, Khaf, Zurabad, and Sarakhs districts. They hate the ?-! MS ’«; |L 3Gypsies. Inhabitants on or near, the Bushire Shiraz road. Persian Government and would make common cause with any invader, even Afghan. In appearance they resemble Arabs. Jamshldi. Habitat, Kushk, mostly in Herat district, but 150 families in Khorasan, near Meshed. They have 'mar,., i -j i _ _ J ^ nictiiy norsemen and are good cavalry material, Tamidni. The greater part live in the Herat district, and a few in Khorasan. They are said to number 17,000 families and to be the most numerous of this group. They are of Turanian origin, and very uncivilised. Only a few are nomadic. Hazara. About 1,200 families live in Persia in the Meshed and Bakharz districts. They are of Uzbak origin, 'and are distinctly of a Monogolian type. Their language is a dialect of Persian. They are fervent Shpahs. It is said that 12,000 families of Gypsies were brought to Persia by the Sassanlan King Bahram Gur (A. D. 420), to act as musicians and singers. They are now scattered, and bear different names, in every province. In south-eastern Persia, they speak of themselves as Fivj, (Arabic word). In Kirman they are known as Lull, in Baluchistan as Luri, in Pars and Kinnan- shah as Kaull, (a corruption of Kabuli), and sometimes as Gurbati. In Azarbaijan, they are called Kara chi, and described as unclean and capable of any iniquity, and in Khorasan as Qirishmdr, derived from a word meaning “out of reckoning”. At Rud-i-Sar in G dan they are known as Qalabala baula, and said to be all thieves. Their occupation is similar to those in England, they sell gaudy spinning wheels and pipe stems, work in iron and leather, deal in horses, camels, donkeys or any living animal, make sieves, tambourines and drums, and tell fortunes. Their character is usually bad. The men are similar in appearance and dress to the surrounding peasantry, the women are different in dress and feature. The tribe is governed by the Shatir Basin, or “ chief runner of the Shah”, who has deputies in every province. In Azarbaijan there are said to be 5.000 families. The total number is Persia is about 100,000 souls. , To oppose an advance from Bushire to Shiraz, various nomad tribes above mentioned, such as the Bakhtidri, Lurs and Qdshqdis, are near enough to be available; but, as they have nolove for the Persian Government, unless assured of its fina success in the operations they would probably merely talk and procrastinate on receiving any orders to take the field. A sub stantial present to the chiefs, .with a promise of future protection and prospects of loot, would probably secure their inaction if not their active co-operation. These tribes are well armed, and mounted on horses that can travel over almost any ground, ren dering them very mobile. They are braver and more enterprising than the ordinary Persian and, whether their chiefs were bribed or not, a careful guarding of the road would be necessary. There are so many feuds and dissensions among them that it is quite possible that if a tribe or a portion of it declared for one side, the other tribe or portion would at once take the opposite sides and they might then be left to fight it out among them selves. This is the favourite policy of the Persian Govern ment in dealing with all nomad tribes. It is said that the inhabitants of Bushire live inconstant fear that the Tangislanis will raid the place. About Kirman there are numbers of small nomad tribes Miscellaneous with a total of 700 to 1,000 families; among these there is no K:irman tribe3 - unity nor combination, but from them a useful body of cavalry might be raised. The national religion of Persia is the Shi’ah form of Mu- Religion hammadanism, which was introduced as such by Shah Ismail Mullammaclaa the founder of the Sufavi Dynasty. (See Chapter I, 1499 A. D.). The reigning Shah is regarded as the regent of Muhammad. Muhammad was born of good family 572 A. D., and, though poor, succeeded after many difficulties, thanks to his extraor dinary talent and audacity, in founding his new doctrine and being accepted as the prophet of God. The Muhammadan era commenced from the Hegira, or Muhammad’s flight from Mecca to Madlnah, 22nd June 622 A. D. From that date the Moslem power steadily grew, till it poured a horde of fanatics over the whole of the then civilized world, conquering and en forcing the Quran at the sward’s point. (See Chapter I, 636 A.D.) Muhammad’s religion was first based'on that of the Jews; Noah, Abraham, Ishmael, Joseph, David, John the Baptist, and Jesus are all regarded as Holy men. The Paradise he offer ed to all true believers was a most powerful factor in making160 the Moslem warriors absolutely fearless of death. It consisted of seven heavens each increasingly attractive in its sensuous delights, till the seventh was reached. Those who fell fighting for the true faith went straight to the 7 th heaven. Muhammad died in 032 A. D. and his three immediate suc cessors were his old companions, Abu-Bakr, Omar, and ’Othmm. On the assassination of the last, the Prophet’s son-in-law ’All, who had married his daughter Fatimah, was inaugurated as Khalifah. From this the dissension arose that resulted in the two sects of Sunni and Shi’ah. The section which adhered to ’ All regarded him as the vice-regent of God, made an addi tion to this effect in the usual Muhammadan confession, and considering the other Khalifahs as usurpers, refused to acknow ledge them. They came to be regarded by other Moslems as heretics and the term Shi’ah w'as applied to them, Shi’ah being an Arabic word meaning “sectary”. The other faction, who look upon Muhammad as the only prophet and Abu-Bakr and his successors as Khalifahs, are called Sunnis, a name de rived from the Sunna, or traditions, which they accept together with the Quran. The result till to-day is a bitter hatred between the Shi’ahs and Sunnis. The Shi’ahs accept the Quran, but their doctrines and practices are more lax than the Sunnis. They almost worship the 12 Imams, beginning with ’All, Hasan, and Husain, wdio all suffered martyrdom, except the 12th Mahdi, who disappeared and will, they believe, return one day and introduce the Moslem millennium. Saiyids are lineal descendants of the Prophet on the father’s side ; they are dis tinguished in Persia by a blue turban and green waist-cloth. ’ All was assassinated in 660 A. D. He had two sons. Hasan and Husain. Hasan succeeded him, but abdicated in favour of the Sunni candidate and was poisoned later. Husain in 680 A. D. collected a few followers and tried to regain the Khallfate, but he and all his followers were killed on the plain of Karbala, which thenceforth became a sacred Shi’ah shrine. This occurred on the 10th day of the month of the Muharram, which is now observed as a time of lamentation for Hasan and Husain and their slain followers ; and it should be remembered that religious feeling then runs very high. Persia is the great centre of the Shi’ah influence, while Turkey is the centre of that of the Sunnis, hence the antagonism betweenPersians and. Turks is intense. Christians and Jews are regarded as people who have received the book, but yet are not true believers. ISTo religion however is so obnoxious to the Persian ShPah as the Sunni. Other Muhammadan sects are— Wahabis. These are described as the Puritans of Muham madanism. Their bigotry, fanaticism and unscruplousnes s make them dangerous. (See Chapter I, Gulf Pirates.) Suf is.^ A small sect. Their learning, philosophical acumen and ascetic self-sacrifice give them an importance and influ ence out of proportion to their numerical strength. Among them- the Adhanians are mendicants, always travelling, al ways companionless and continually moving their lips in de votion. The 'Ajamians always live in the mountains, are rigidly abstemious and wear very scanty clothing. 'AU-illahl are a sect nominally and outwardly conforming to Muhammadanism. Their doctrine is that ’AH is God hinT- self. They are a large sect, numerous in Azarbajjan, Kerind and Kirmanshah. There are supposed to be 100,000 in Persia ; of these o0,000 are in Azarbaijan and about the same number in Kirmanshah. They are supposed to be either— (а) A remnant of old Persians partly converted by fear to Islam. ( б ) Really Christians and outwardly Muhammadans. The chief object of the Yezidees' faith and worship is the Vezideas. devil, to whom they believe the world belongs. Hence they are called Devil worshippers. They are chiefly found in Syria and Mesopotamia, but there are a few in north-western Persia. They consider all nations their enemies, especially the Kurds. Christians include Protestants, Greek Orthodox, Roman nr ■ ■ Catholics, Armenians and Nestorians. They are tolerated f!hri3liani but the meanest Muhammadan is considei’ed superior to any Christian, who can expect no justice at the hands of the law against him. There is an especially strict law against any Muhammadan touching any liquid^ that has been handled by a Christian ; this includes juicy fruits such as grapes.162 Zoroaatrtan. Babiam. Sunnis are, as a rule, much less bigoted with* regard to Christians than Shi’ahs, Zoroaster the prophet of Iran was born 660 B. C., probably at Urumieh. His teaching emphasized purity, monotheism, keeping earth, fire and water undefiled, care of useful animals, abhorrence of falsehood, and resurrection and future life; to attain which good thoughts, words and deeds alone will be in tercessors. Places of worship are known as fire temples In these burn the holy fire brought down from heaven by Zoroaster, which only high priests can approach. Parsis are required to pray sixteen times a day. At the age of 7 they are invested with the S udrehjmd Kusti, i. e., the sacred shirt and thread. They may wear dress of any nationality, but underneath must, always wear these two symbols. Their dead are exposed in towers of silence till all the flesh is devoured by birds, and only the skeleton re mains. Their sacred books, 21 in number, are called Zend Avesta. Avesta is the original sacred text, and Zend the commentary. Of these only portions are now extant, which include th five Gathas, containing the actual sayings and teachings of Zoroaster himself. This religion prevailed In Persia, over the older religions of Buddhism and Magism, till rooted out by the Arab invasion The Magi worship resembled that of the \ edas, and adored the sun and moon. M irza ’AH Muhammad, son of a grocer at Shiraz, was born i + i aoo After a pilgrimage to Mecca, he became a pup J HM laiyid K^to^Karbda. On the death of the latter. \ £ • -Afl tn the leadership of the sect formed by his mastei, he aspired to the ^ ^ of hig mani{estatiou and tfift 3 23rd May 1844. He then preached at Bushire, attack- Wa %t Mums ^nd claiming miraculous power. He denounced mev“ng irreligion of the times, the laxity vices and un- fitness of the Mullas, emphasizing the need of morah y &gt; Hppds rather than words and formal rules. He advocate t ‘ ee ' ’ ' nunosed the use of opium, discountenanced t^peranoe, owoted the prohibited divoree, iualitv of sexes, encouraged the practice of hosp.tal.tytUid demanded justice for all citizens alike. He now assumed the title of “ The Bab”, or gate through whom knowledge of the 12th Imam or Mahdi, who disappeared, could alone be attained. His pretentions then became more and more extravagant; he successively announced himself as the Mahdi, as a re-incarnation of the Prophet, and finally as an incarnation of God himself. Many well known Mullas joined him, and his disciples spread his faith far and wide through Iran. The severest repressive measures were taken by Government, and in 1845 the Bab himself was imprisoned at Shiraz. Escaping thence, he was again arrested in Isfahan, and im prisoned at Maku and after wards at Cherik in Azarbaijan. Finally, in 1850, he was shot at Tabriz, in the hope that his death w ould end the movement. His execution nearly had fatal results for the Persian Government, for, by some extraordinary chance, the first volley fired at him merely cut the ropes that bound him, leaving him uninjured. Had he retained sufficient presence of mind, to stand forth and claim a miracle, it is impossible to say what far reaching effects it would have had; lie, however, attempted to escape,was caught and killed. In Mazandaran bars, Kirman and ‘Iraq many hundreds of Babis were killed, dying fighting to the last, and enduring cruel tortures. In 1851 in Zinjan, they sustained for months a siege against the Shah’s troops, fighting finally from house to house, till all were killed. Seven leading sectaries, since known as the seven martyrs, were executed in Tehran. Outbreaks at Yazd and other places were put down with the utmost cruelty. In 1852, four Babis made an attempt to assassinate the Shah near Tehran. In consequence some thirty Babis were executed in Tehran with horrible tortures. Among the victims was one of the Babis’ most celebrated converts, Khurath-al-‘Ain, daughter of the chief Shi‘ah priest of Shiraz, who v r as beheaded by order of Xasr-ucl-Din. Her beauty and eloquence had won many con verts. The BabI leaders after this adopted a new policy of concealment and secret propagandism, and avoided all open conflict with- Government. 'Hie Bab had nominated as his successor Subh-i-Azal, but dis sensions arose terminating in a split, as his elder half-brother, Mirza Husain ‘Ali, succeeded in being accepted as the leader of the majority, under the name of Baha 'Ullah, The new leader164 put aside the spirit of intolerance of the Bab, strove for a bettet understanding with Jews, Christians and Zoroastrians, and to make Babism a universal religion suitable to all mankind. There was to be no distinction between prince and peasant, all nations were to be considered equal before God, there was to be no chosen people, and there should be equality of sexes. The Republican form of Government was most approved ,as in it all men are equal. He recognised three prophets, Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad. In fact, his doctrines were a re-action of humanitarian and socialistic ideas against the intolerance of Islam. Finally, he was in favour of conciliating the Government. He died in 1892 and was succeeded as spiritual head by his son ’ Abbas Effendi, who is the present manifestation. For the last thirty years the Babis have been free from persecution by Gov ernment, and through secret propaganda, they have so diffused their doctrines, that they probably now number about three millions; but a correct estimate is difficult, as the association is kept secret. In Tehran alone there are reported to bo 20,000 scattered about tire city. At any rate the numbers are said to be growing, and people predict that it will one day be the leading religion of Persia. At the present day Babism remains divided into two sections (1) the Baha’is (2) the Azalls. The former are by far the more numerous, observe a very strict ritual, arc extremely hostile to Government, and look forward to a kingdom with central seat of government in south west Persia, with the head of the sect as ruler. They regard themselves as adherents of a new world-wide religion. Their chief ‘Abbas Effendi lives at Acre, whence emissaries and publications are sent out. They claim converts in Constantinople, Egypt, and America. The AzalTs have for their chief, Subh-i-Azal, who lives in retirement in Cyprus,whither he was banished by the Turkish Government. They accept existing Government, and inculcate loyalty on adher ents. Their ritual is very simple, and their books advise as to good government and political reform. They accept converts among Christians, and from outside Persia, and look upon them selves as a reformed Mussulman sect. Babis pretend to play no political part, but are friendly to Russia, as representing a better system of government than their own. At one time they were inclined to England, nowRussia makes use of them. The Russian employes on the road from Rasht openly profess Babism, and there are many Babis in the Cossack Brigade. They form admirable intelligence agents, as they assist one another and are spread throughout the country. They are always opposed to the \iolent intolerance of the .Mullas, and are, generally speaking, an association for the dissemination of enlightenment, education and the principles of good government. Sometimes, in abandon ing Mussulman doctrines, they become lax livers and a source of scandal. Babis indulge in vague aspirations towards universal brother hood. The possibility of using them politically has been pointed out. It is more than suspected that the Russians, in 1902 and earlier, used them as intelligence agents. Among their numbers are said to be many leading men of Government, and many of socialistic ideas, making the sect now more political than religious. On occasions they have claimed, and obtained, the protection of the British and Russians legations, especially of the latter. In 1903, there were riots against them instigated by the mullas, and in Shiraz, Isfahan, Yazd and Rasht many were killed, and some brutally tortured. Some hundreds 1 of BabI families have moved into Russian territory, where they were well received, and there is a thriving colony at Askhabad. During the revolu tionary movement in Persia, the Baha’i section were ordered to abstain from all participation in politics, the reason being, appa rently, that some of the most advanced Nationalists were Azalis and the feeling between the sects is very bitter, though the Azalis are said to be very weak numerically and not on the increase. Under the name Bahaism (from Baha‘Ullah the founder), the doctrine is to-day spreading to other countries. Its aim is to unite people of different religions and sects, especially Slii’ahs and Sunnis. Its tenets are, no clergy, no prayers, only dogma belief in God and his manifestations, whether by Zoroaster, Moses, Jesus, etc., or Baha’Ullah. Converts are said to exceed two millions, and to embrace Muhammadans in Turkey, northern Africa and India. Also Sikhs, Brahmans, Buddhists and Parsis in India, Tavists of China and Shintoists of Japan Finally Christians of Russia, Germany, France and America. In London there are an appreciable number, and smaller circles in the larger towns, and in Canada,166 Statistics. Statistics, as to the exact numbers of each religion above des cribed, are most conflicting, which, in the total absence of reliable data, is not to be Avandered at. A rough estimate may be arrived at by taking 90 per cent, of the population to be Shi’alls, 9 per cent.

Trade, Products, Supplies and Transport. An important British Indian Commercial Mission, under Trade, the presidency of Mr. Gleadowe-Newcomen, proceeded to south eastern Persia during 1904—1905, and furnished a very complete trade report on that area. They came to the conclusion that British commerce with Persia was not in as healthy a condition as could be desired. It had expanded little during the last 15 years, remaining practically stagnant during the last five years— in fact the latest statistics disclosed a slight decrease ; while Russian trade during 1900—1904 showed an enormous advance, though the Russo-Japanese war checked fit greatly during 1904-05 ; and Russia was not relaxing her efforts. Statistics of the Belgian Administration of Persian Cus toms, for the year ending March 20th, 1904, showed the value of the entire foreign trade of Persia that year to be (60 krans being taken to £1 sterling) £10,661,695, made up by imports £6,415,609 and exports £4,246,086. Of this Russia’s share amounted to a total of £5,668,340, of which £3,077,636 represent imports, and £2,590,704 ex ports. The British Empire’s share was £2,490,009, of which £2,138,112 represented imports, and £351,897 exports. As Russia exports nearly as much as she imports, these figures, which show that the British Empire takes little from Persia in comparison to the amount she sends into that country, indicate an opening for England and India to increase their trade in Persian produce. The greater part of British, as well as Indian, trade with Persia enters through Persian Gulf ports, and, of the trade with these ports, about 70 per cent, represents that with the British empire,168 The position of British trade with Persians not so bad as it seems to be at first sight. The reasons for the great advance of Russian trade as compared with British are :— (1) Communications with Russia are comparatively easy. (2) The whole northern boundary of Persia marches with Russian territory. (3) The population of northern Persia and the contiguous provinces of Russia are nearly identical, so far as their habits and wants are concerned, so there is no need to specialize for one side of the border or the other. Tn addition, the richest and most prosperous parts of Per sia are in the north, and Russian trade is nursed and bolstered up by artificial means. On the other hand British trade with Persia is handicapped. The major portion enters by the Gulf ports, and has to overcome great difficulties in the landing of goods and their transit inland. Communications in the south are bad, and the roads are infested by robbers. The introduction of the new Customs Tariff and then the Reglement have both had a detrimental effect on British trade ; this, however, should only be temporary. The Indian and Anglo-Indian manufacturers require to study more carefully the promising market that lies at their door. I he Mission formed the opinion that Bundar ’Abbas is the best and most conveniently situated port on the Gulf, except Ahwaz on the Karun, over which it has the advantage of shorter sea transit. It is the natural outlet of and entrance for trade, not only of south-east Persia, but of the immense tract of country lying between Herat and Yazd, Meshed and Bampur. In this respect it is superior to Bushire ; while the roadstead is better, and Clarence Strait, close by, affords an ex cellent site for a protected harbour. Bandar ’Abbas, however, requires dredging, a good pier and a breakwater, sanitation, a sweet water-supply, improvement of the roads to the plateau, organization of supply of transport animals, improved customs house premises, and bonded warehouses. The districts of Rudbar and Jiruft adjacent to Bandar ’Abbas are very fertile, and would, if properly irrigated, yield a golden harvest. At present the fine water-supply runs chiefly to, waste.In addition to the Bandar ’Abbas and Bushire routes. British trade can enter by the Karun river to Ahwaz, and thence ,by the Lynch road to Isfahan. From Ahwaz to Burujird via Dizful would be an excellent line were it not that the lawless state of the country has hitherto prevented its development. From Baghdad via Khaniqin to Hamadan and Tehran has always been an important line, because there are no bad hutals to be crossed, as further south, and it is the only road by which heavy merchandise can reach Tehran from that side. The Nushki route to - Robat and Khorasan had at first to contend with difficulties from the Russian Plague Cordon ; but now that these restrictions are removed, should prosper. By the Russo-Persian Treaty of Turkmanehal, a duty of T^e 1903 5 per cent, ad valorem was imposed on all goods, exports and Tanfl ‘ imports, passing between Russia and Persia. This duty was subsequently extended, under a “ most favoured nation clause ” to British trade with Persia. In 1902 a new Russo-Persian convention was ratified, under which a revised tariff, drawn up by Russia, came into force on the 14th February 1903. This tariff substituted for the 5 per cent, ad valorem dutj% a system of specific duties, which affects certain articles to a greater extent than others. An Anglo-Persian agreement was signed on 9th February 1903, by which Great Britain secured equal treatment with Russia under the new tariff ; but the duties nevertheless fall more heavily on articles in which Great Britain and India are most interested (such as, tea and cotton piece- goods), than on those in which Russia is chiefly concerned. The chief exports and imports of Persia’s trade with Great Trade with the Britain are :— British Empire Exports. —Horses, mules, oil seeds, wheat, raw cotton (greater part, however, goes to Russia), gums, hides, skins, opium, pearls, rose water, silk tissues, wool, carpets and shawls. Imports .—Cotton yarns and tissues, drugs, dyes, metals, spices, sugar, tea, and woollen textiles. Of these cotton textiles and tea are much the most important. During the Revolution and under the new Government, statistics, British trade has suffered a good deal owing to the insecurity 1908-09. of the roads in southern Persia, especially in the neighbourhood of Shiraz. The tonnage of Persian Gulf traffic, which is almost entirely in British ships, shows, however, an increase of more than 10 per cent. The centres of British trade are nowImports and Exports.

The remaining countries whose trade makes up the grand total are Afghanistan, Austria, Belgium, Egypt, America, Greece, Japan, Holland, Sweden, Masqat and ’Oman, There is con siderable trade with the last named. Eor several years now the Germans have been making German strenuous efforts to increase their trade in Persia, via the Bagh- dad-Kirmanshah route. Nearly three years ago an article in the “ Berliner Tageblatt ” suggested that Germany might obtain naphtha concessions in the central or southern zone or even in the northern zone, and introduce German goods by the Hamburg- Amerika steamship company through Muhammareh. The article concluded “ Germany has no wish to oust England on the Tigris or on the Karun, but she demands freedom for her com mercial and industrial activity in this neutral zone.” In 1907 Kurt Jang, officially deputed by the German Government to examine the prospects of German commerce, visited Meshed, Kirman, Bandar ’Abbas, Bushire, Shiraz, Kirmanshah and Tehran. The same year, Dr. Hugo-Grothe travelled from Cons tantinople to Baghdad, and then made a tour in Persia in the regions considered to be within the neutral zone. The journey was said to have been assisted by the German Government. In his report he urged the pushing of German interests in these regions, and was optimistic of the future of the Baghdad Rail way. The Hamburg-Amerika Line have a monthly service be tween Hamburg and Bandar ’Abbas, Lingeh, Bushire and Muhammareh, at all of which places Robert Wonckhaus &amp; Company are their Agents. They also have a very energetic agent at Baghdad. These German steamers are increasing their carrying trade from Antwerp, the chief items of Belgian cargo being sugar, kerosene, and arms. These steamers are run at aRussian trado. Other count ries. Minerals. 172 loss to the Persian Gulf, but are compensated by a consider able subsidy from the German Government. Russia imports into Persia sugar, cotton tissues, kerosene, animals, flour, tobacco, and other vegetable products, and ex ports raw products, such as dried fruits, raw cotton, rice, hides, felts, wool, cocoon silk, and gums. With other countries the imports into Persia are sugar, woollen, cotton, and silk tissues from France and Austria, tea from China and Batavia, raw materials from Turkey and Afghanistan, and manufactured articles and sugar (cube and moist) from Germany. The exports consist of opium to Turkey and China, cocoon silk to France and Italy, carpets to Turkey, Europe and America, and cotton, silk, and woollen tissues to Afghanistan and Turkey. The following are the principal resources of the country. Lord Curzon divides the mineral-producing zones roughly into six. 1, Azarbaijan ; 2, the northern and southern slopes of the main Elburz range, between Rudbar near Rasht and Astarabad ; 3, Khorasan ; 4, Kirman ; 5, the central districts between Qum and Shiraz, principally around Isfahan and Naln ; 6, the Persian Gulf littoral and islands. Of these— 1. In Azarbaijan, iron, lead, and copper ores exist in abundance. The richest district is Karadagh, where there are iron and copper mines. Lead, copper and saltpetre have been produced from the Khalkhal region ; coal from a spot four miles north-east of Tabriz. In the adjoining Khamseh district are deposits of copper, lead, coal and mercury. 2. The slopes of the Elburz are particularly rich in deposits of coal and iron, found in close proximity. The most produc tive areas lie north-west of Tehran, between there and Kazvln, north-east towards Demavand and further east towards Shah- rud. A number of coal mines are situated on the slopes half -K-ay between Tehran and Kazvln, and others in the Darbandisar district. These are clumsily and tentatively worked by native proprietors or by foreign lessees, and supply Tehran with coal, 3. In Khorasan there are abandoned copper mines at Gur kha nl on the high road between Shahrud and Meshed. Good coal is reported 8 miles south of Chinaran and about Isfaraiu.Some lead mines are at Damghan, copper, coal, and iron are also found near there. Copper mines are scattered all over the country but scarcely worked. 4. In Kirmancoal exists atBasirgan 13 miles north of the capital, at Deh Tagi 11 miles further north, to the north-east on the road to Itavar, and throughout the Kuhbaran district. Very rich manganese ore is found 60 miles from Kirman to* wards Ravar. 5. In the central districts the entire country between Qum and Isfahan contains mineral ores of considerable richness and variety. There is coal among the hills near Soh, and in the immediate neighbourhood of Isfahan. At Gargaon, 22 farsahhs from Isfahan, iron and coal are plentiful, also at ’Ali ’Arab, 16 farsakhs distant. There is a place called Rubairan beyond Bafq from Yazd, also within easy reach of Kirman, where coal has been discovered. About 5 farsahhs from Yazdikhast, and in the Abadeh district, coal is reported as abundant. Cop per, lead, sulphur, asbestos, and manganese have also been discovered in large quantities in the Anarak district. The mountains near Qum are rich in copper. 6. In the Persian Gulf littoral it was hoped that coal had been discovered in Dashtistan ; this, however, has been classed fts brown coal of no commercial value. The Bakhtiari Khans claim that coal exists in their country ; but so far, it has turned out to be chiefly bitumen ; this is certainly the case in the Ramuz district, but further north, in the Bakhtiari country near Shush- tar, good coal indications have been found. Hormuz island and Qishm now export rock salt and iron ochre. It is estimated that in Hormuz there are at least a million tons of rock salt. There are sulphur mines at Khamir and Bustaneh near Lingeh and also in Hormuz island. A company entitled “ The Persian Bank Mining Rights Corporation, ” was formed in 1890, to acquire and work the mining rights conceded to the Imperial Bank of Persia by Royal firman. There were various reservations, and the concession extends for 60 years. The Company’s engineers have done a great deal of prospecting, and furnished many useful reports. The difficulties against successful mining are the cost of trans port to the nearest market, the severity of the climate, enormous cost of conveyance of machinery, and the humours of Persian officialdom. For these reasons the company was Dot very successful,174 The oil resources of the country deserve special mention, as they seem destined to have an important future. Persia abounds in petroleum springs^' ;but the richest sources are in a long belt from the Diala river in Kurdistan, following the trend of the mountains on the southern slopes and plains, to Ahmad! near Bandar ’Abbas. Wells have been drilled near the Diala river, south-east of Shushtar, at Daliki (abandoned), and at a promising source on Qishm island. It may thus be seen that the most part of the system lies in the neutral zone. Petroleum indications also exist along the valleys of the Tigris and Euph rates. In 1901, the Persian Government granted an Englishman, Mr. D’Arcy, the exclusive right to bore for oil in Persia, except in the provinces of Azarbaijan, Gxlan, Mazandaran, Astarabad, and Khorasan. These were excepted, as the Grand Vizier was afraid of giving umbrage to Russia. In the concession it was agreed to pay the Persian Government £20,000 sterling in cash, £20,000 sterling in paid-up shares, and 16 per cent, of the annual net profits. An agreement was made between Messrs. D’Arcy and Con cessions Syndicate^ Limited, and the Bakhtiari Khans, for the acquisition of necessary land, erecting buildings, etc., and the guarding of the works and the projected pipe line. Eor guard ing these, the Khans were to be paid £3,000 ; they were alfo allotted 3 per cent, of the shares fully paid-up. The Anglo- Persian Oil Company, Limited, capital £2,000,000 are now the legal successors of D’Arcy and his associates. They have ob tained, from the Shaikh of Muhammerah, a concession to erect an oil refinery on ’Abbadan island with a frontage on the Shatt- al-Arub ; and the construction of a pipe line to that place from Maidan-i-Minaftun, some 60 miles south-east of Shushtar, is now proceeding. The total length will be 130 miles, the cost about £400,000, and it is expected to be ready for use in 1912. The two places will it is hoped also be connected by telephone. The company are also permitted to run a steam launch and two barges for one year on the Karun river, to transport the pipes a,nd machinery, but the matter has given rise to some disputes. At first a small guard of Indian infantry was kept at the oil fields, these have now been withdrawn, as the Bakhtiaris are performing their guard duties fairly satisfactorily. Mention may be made also of the celebrated turquoise mines near Nishapur, which are believed to be the only minesin the world worth the name, which have been worked extensive ly, or which have produced the turquoise of perfect shape and colour. Persia is poorly furnished with timber and, except for the Forests, magnificent dense forests, extending along the southern shores of the Caspian on the northern slopes of the Elburz, wooded areas are few and far between, and are being gradually cleared off by the reckless waste of the inhabitants. The most noteworthy of these areas is the Pusht-i-Kuh and the neighbourhood of ^ Khurramabad, and there are still wooded places among the mountains of Kirman. The littorals of the Persian Gulf and Arabian Sea, except for date palms, are exceptionally treeless. The shores of the Clarence Straits are covered with thick stunted jungle. Fire wood is cut here and exported to many places in the Persian Gulf. There are fruit trees around most towns and villages. Wheat, barley, rice, millet and sesame are produced, the Grain and other first two in considerable quantities ; they are dealt with later food-stuffs. under the heading “ supplies, ” as also are fruit and vegetables. Many varieties of fruit and vegetable are grown where there is a sufficient water-supply. Rice is cultivated in very large quantities only in the Caspian provinces ; in most other places the amount is limited. Dates are grown all along the southern coast of Persia, and form a valuable food-supply. They are largely exported from Muhammerah, Bandar ’Abbas, and Minab. The grape is extensively cultivated, and good wine is made wines, at Shiraz, Isfahan, Hamadan, and Tehran. There is no export trade in wine. The following resources, manufactures, and industries. Miscellaneous, though not so important from a military point of view, may be briefly mentioned. The castor oil plant is grown almost everywhere, the oil being used for lamps. Opium has long been a chief source of revenue, and one of the most important exports to China, Great Britain and America,176 The principal markets are Isfahan, Shiraz, Fasa, ^xiriz, Yazd, Kirman, Hamadan, Burujird, Meshed and Tabriz. The crop occupies the fields from November to June. The export duty has been raised from 5 per cent, to 14 per cent, but the produc tion of the drug increases to the detriment of more useful crops, and the demoralisation of the people. Cotton is largely grown in Khorasan and also in central Persia, Isfahan, Yazd, Kashan, Shiraz, Sistan, and to a lesser extent in Azarbaijan. It is short in the staple, of inferior quality, and exported principally to Russia. The value of the export is about £450,000. Persian tobacco is obtained from a distinct species of plant. It is grown chiefly at Khaf, Tun, Isfahan, Shiraz and Jahrum and exported to Turkey, Aden, and India, to a total value of about £25,000. Ordinary tobacco is also grown in small quantities about Kirmanshah, and at Rasht and Urumieh. Goat and sheep shins are exported to India from the Gulf ports. There is a valuable trade in lambskins to Russia, chiefly from Shiraz. Fox and sable skins are exported to Russia to the extent of about 160,000 skins per annum. Gum tragacanth is extracted from a low thorn-bush, which grows abundantly in the hilly districts of Kurdistan and western Persia. The best quality comes from Burujird, Nihavand, and Kirmanshah. The deserts produce hqmnce and assafcetida. Gum arabic and gum ammoniac are obtained from Shiraz and its vicinity. The forests of Pusht-i-Kuh produce gum-mastic. The following colouring plants are pro duced : indigo, saffron, madder and henna. The silk industry has revived in northern Persia, and the silkworm is extensively reared in Gilan and Mazandaran; in a single year over 1,000 tons of cocoons, valued at £240,000 were exported from Rasht, chiefly to MarseiUes and Milan. Aearly half the production goes to Tabriz, Kashan, Kirman, &amp;c., wher ever carpets, brocades and velvets are manufactured, in o e places in Persia silk is cultivated, but in insignificant quantities. For wool, Meshed is the market in the east, and Kirmanshan in the west. At the latter place it is- much used m home industries. About £80,000 represents the value of wool ex ported.•UMjili, i. titesif expat 4^ ithe pitdiit. aseM biueitii nitoaltsa le, oi fc eTaheolin 3ecsstJ|iki z and Jin total nloei on ia d Uriieli. ilioiiitlieK EKia,ti dtoIW ftoi Bop rodaceiif** i'/fateol)®' jf Pt4t-i'£ l plgtS®!®' Persia is celebrated for its carpets, the manufacture of which is confined chiefly to those districts in which wool gram and labour are most abundant. Kirman carpets are very highly esteemed especially in Constantinople. Tabriz pro duces high grade carpets, and in Sultanabad large quantities of all grades are produced by the British firm of Messrs. /negler &amp; Co., and the Persian Manufacturing Co. Pars and urdistan are noted for their heavy all wool carpets, Many siik carpets are woven in Meshed. Isfahan, Kashan, and Kirmanshah all produce good work. Persian carpets are made on hand looms most of the workers being women and a few hoys, ihe total value of carpets exported annually may be taken to be usually about £250,000. The use of aniline dyes m the manufacture is now strictly prohibited. Ifater, the basis of everything, is an uncertain supply Supplies and m rersia. Leaving the immense tracts of desert entirely out of ^ rau3 ' p P rt the question, it can by no means be certain that, in places where de “ lp - there is water, it is not too brackish to drink. Even streams among the mountains are sometimes perfectly salt and useless, whfie another stream close by is quite sweet. The snowfall on the high peaks is the saving of manv parts of Persia ; for thereby natural reservoirs are formed, from which, with the melting of the snow, the water descends to the lower ground. ( 4 ^ an ^ t ‘ or kanz is an aqueduct for conducting the water ^om its parent springs in the mountain, to the place where it is required for drinking or cultivation. The qanat is a subterranean channel, the kanz being strictly speaking an open channel though sometimes the term is used in the same sense as qanat especially m Afghanistan and Baluchistan. In the case of circular shafts are sunk to the subterranean tunnel every 20 yards or so, by means of which the excavated soil is drawn to the surface, and heaped round the mouth of the shaft. These shafts are subsequently of use to keep the tunnel clear, but are very dangerous in the case of abandoned qanats, as the earth about the mouths, which should indicate their presence, o e ts washed away, and lines of blind wells form traps everywhere further information about water will be found in Chapter III Part (ii). The Route books deal with the matter at the various stages. Scarcity of water will often be found an obstacle to the movement of troops, except in small detachments. The supply can often be improved, however, with a little labour.178 Supplies. General. Horses. A list of districts and towns with supplies normally pro curable will be given. The quantities obtainable in disturbed times depend on various conditions. Usually it may be taken as probable, that the inhabitants of most localities would be quite willing to furnish supplies to an invader, when they found they were well paid for them. A sense of patriotism would not deter them, but a fear of punishment from the authorities when the invaders withdrew, and the influence of muUds and such like fanatical persons might do so. The best plan would, there fore, appear to be to despatch in advance agents, well supplied with money, and working in conjunction with the various Consuls, who could unostentatiously purchase as much as was available. The intense cold at certain seasons, (see Chapter III, Climate), renders the deficiency of fuel serious. Grazing is procurable in many places after the rains ; the rest of the year, animals are fed on bhusa. The question of supplies may be summarised as follows In southern Persia, from the neighbourhood of the Karim river, supplemented from Mesopotamia, a large amount of food grains could be obtained from the country to increase the com missariat of any force operating there. From the Karim river to a line roughly from Yazd to Bandar ’Abbas, a few supplies might be obtained locally. East of this line little is procurable except possibly dates and sheep and goats - In Sistan a very large supply of grain would be available, as also in the north-eastern corner of Persia. The Russians estimate that 200,000 cwts. of wheat can be exported every year. Other authorities put the amount much higher. The following are all rich grain-producing districts hereabouts Sar-i-Vilayat, Nishapur, Turshiz, Turbat-i-Haidari, Kliaf, Rcdkan, Darreh-Gaz, Kuehan (a very large amount). The Persian horse is very nearly related to the Arab, but is more slightly built, stands as a rule rather higher, and is coarser bred. In the north-east are the Turkoman, and mixed Persian and Turkoman breeds. The Turkoman horses are often weedy in appearance, but possess great endurance. In the north-west, near the Russian border, is a Cossack breed; in Kurdistan the Kurdish horse; and in the west and south-west the Arab,179 will sinks IMjli® itiaiii katkjli M\ii Am uiili ro A at M IlL K T«fe irai® gispsi geasis- BtiieSit2‘ is, a fa. ittle'if- 6 The best horse districts are Khorasan, Kirmanshah and Hama- dan. The breeding is chiefly in the hands of nomad tribes, and the numbers available are less than formerly. Generally speaking, the horses are of the Indian cavalry or mounted infantry type, and horses for British cavalry and artillery are not procurable. All purchases would be entires; mares are never sold and seldom ridden. Good native cavalry remounts would cost £16 or £17, and mounted infantry ponies £10 to £12, and the cost of marching to shipping points would be additional. This price represents the maximum limit; for Persian horses, suitable for Indian cavalry, can be purchased in the Bombay market at prices averaging well under Rs.AOO each, for the batch. Owing to the increasing demand for horses in Per sia itself, the numbers landed in Bombay has greatly decreased of late years. Persian and Turkoman horses can only be bought in large numbers in northern Khorasan or Kurdistan. A few Arabs are imported for rich men. There is much un soundness, soft bone and spavin among horses in Persia, and cracked heels and sand cracks much depreciate t'eir value. Horses are mostly trained to saddle from yearlings upwards, and broken to severe bits, which, however, do not spoil the fresh ness of their mouths for European bitting. The endurance of Persian horses is average, their temper good, and their hoofs would be excellent were it not for the system of shoeing, which will be described later. They are fed on barley and chaff of wheat (kdh). The best time for purchasing is from 1st August to 1st March, when agricultural work is slack and there is no grazing As regards the numbers available, estimates differ greatly, and at best can only be approximate. For remount purposes Persia may be divided into two parts.— (a) Khorasan and the north-east generally, whence ani mals could be marched to Quetta. {b) The rest of Persia whence they could be taken to a Gulf port for shipment.180 (To save repetition mules'will bo included in this esti mate.)

The Mules, chief breeders are the nomad tribes and the best districts for the supply are in the west and south-west of Persia. As a head-quar ters for mule purchasing, the town of Kirmanshah is well situated for it taps two sources, the west and the north. Within a radius of some 50 miles to the south-west of the city, the largest dealers and breeders of mules are the Kalhurs, the Ilkhanl of whom is said to be the largest owner of mules in Persia. Isfahan in former days was considered a good centre for this purpose. The best and only profitable time to buy is from July to March. The absence of all railway communication, and of any large horse or mule owners, make the buying of animals a tedious and expensive business. If, in peace time, the supply and trans port corps would take mules of 3 years of age, 2,000 mules could be obtained yearly from south-western Persia. Persian mules, being chiefly bred in rugged mountainous countries, have good hardy constitutions. They are trained to pack and saddle from 2£- years of age, but never to harness. Their endurance is very great : the Persian stage averages not less than 20 miles daily, and the loads are excessive. Their tempers are as a rule good, and they improve rapidly with careful hand ling. Hoofs are by nature excellent, but in many cases suffer from constant neglect and require careful attention on pur chase. Their feed is the same as for horses, barley 7 lbs daily, or on the road with loads 10 lbs and 1 shah man of chaff daily. The Arab mule of ’Arabistan is small and light, standing about 13 hands. Around Shushtar and Dizful mules are rather larger, 13'2; and further north, about Kirmanshah, they are still larger and stronger, standing nearly 15 hands. A force occupying the country would do well to engage, if possible, caravans complete with native equipment and chdrvd- dars under their own headmen, and not attempt to organise newly purchased animals into a trams port corps, with ordnance equipment and new drivers. Returns estimate over 25,000 mules available for hire in Khorasan; but the greater number of these would be within the Russian sphere of influence, while the British sphere and its adjacent country are better suited to camels. The best transport animal, and the one principally used, oamels. in eastern and south-eastern Persia, is the camel, The finest182 Donkeys. Bullocks. Livestock. come from Khorasan and Kazvin. The Khorasan camel is noted for its size and strength, and, owing to its long hair, is capable of enduring extreme cold. The camels of Baluchistan and southern Persia are smaller and more suitable for riding. An ordinary Persian camel can carry 320 to 400 lbs for 15 miles a day, at an average rate of 2|- miles an hour. The Khorasan camel is reputed to be cap able of covering 20 miles a day with a heavier load, and their price is accordingly higher than the ordinary kind. A good camel is said to last for at least 15 years in regular work. It is estimated that there are some 15,000 camels suitable for transport in southern Persia ; prices vary from Ps. 100 to 200, but would certainly rise if large numbers were bought. Probably 5.000 could be obtained, nearly all from the south-east. The lowest estimate for camels procurable from Khorasan is 17,500, so it is probable that under normal conditions this number could be secured. On the routes from Sistan to Quetta, Meshed, and Kirman, there are said to be over 2,000 employed. Large numbers of donkeys are used in Persia for transport purposes, particularly on the roads inland from Bandar ’Abbas and Lingeh, and in Sistan. Many can be purchased in Arabis- tan, and a number are bought over from Masqat and Bahrain. In Bahrain there are said to be about 4,000 at prices ranging up to Rs. 200 ; their exceptional size and strength make them valuable transport animals, for they are as big as an average sized mule. The Persian donkey, however, is small, though strong and enduring, and capable of carrying a load varying between 130 and 200 lbs. ; riding donkeys fetch from £3 to £4 ; pack donkeys up to £3. They are obtainable in very large numbers all over southern Persia, and it is estimated that there are 200,000 suitable for transport purposes in south-western Persia alone. Bullocks of a small and sturdy type are used by the Bakli- tiaris and Lur tribes, for transport purposes, and also in other parts of south-western Persia. There are said to be over 200.000 thus employed. Besides the animals used in Persia for transport, there is practically an unlimited supply of sheep and goats, which are maintained by the nomad tribes both for the value of theirwool and hair, and as a source of food supply. In winter, the nomads drive their flocks down to the plains in search of pasture, returning to the higher altitudes as the summer season advances. From 45,000 to 60,000 head of sheep, valued at from £25,000 to £30,000, are exported annually to Trans-Caucasia, from Azar- baijan and Kurdistan. Trans-Caspia is supplied from KhoraSan with livestock to the value of about £20,000 per annum. The dark coloured felt of the nomads’ tents is made from the hair of goats and camels. The number of cattle in good pasturage districts is also very great, as will be seen from the detailed reports which follow, but to secure them for an invading force, it would be necessary to gain the confidence of the inhabitants in advance, to prevent their being driven off and concealed in remote places. There is no vehicle in Persia peculiar to the country ; in fact, Wheeled tram owing to the physical difficulties and absence of suitable roads, port - in many parts wheeled transport is never to be found, even at the present day. In recent years the northern parts of the country have been provided with several good main roads con structed by foreign enterprise, chiefly Russian, and upon these carriages are used by foreigners and rich Persians, and also in the postal service. They can be hired, together with post horses, from the postal contractors, but charges are very high and bag gage is extra. The vehicles are nearly all of Russian manufac ture, and are generally of the droschhi or “ phaeton n type with four wheels, and are drawn either by a pair of horses or by four harnessed abreast. Since the Belgian officials took over the management of the postal service, they have introduced fourr ons wherever it has been found possible to do so. These are also* of Russian make, with no springs and drawn by four horses. Besides carrying the mail they are gradually coming into use for the transport of merchandise. Carriages at present come as far south as Shiraz. Wheeled transport could be utilized if the roads were improved by a little labour, from Bandar ’Abbas to Rigan and thence to Kirman, and from Bushire to Shiraz via Firuzabad, and in’Arabistan up to Dizfffl, and thence to Khurramabad and Hamadan. Horses and mules are shod in Persia in a manner, which, Persian the natives say, gives them the best foot hold and protection metl ? od of over rough stony passes. shoeing.184 Supply and transport in detail. Kliorasan. The hoof is shortened to the required length with a clumsy cutter and rasp, and a thin plate, which covers the entire lower surface of the foot, except for a circular hole over the frog, is then fitted by cold hammering, and secured on each side bv four large headed nails about long, which are roughly clenched. The plates are not countersunk and the heads of the nails all project and give a foothold even on sheet rock. This pattern of shoe w as tested by Indian Cavalry and transport units and was condemned, because mud works into the hollow parts of the sole, through the hole in the centre of the shoe, and the sole being enclosed cannot be properly cleaned and thrush is induced. On the other hand, it is pointed out that horses, shod in the ordi nary .-way, are almost inevitably lamed by the rocks and stones on such roads as that between Bushire and Shiraz ; also the Per sian pattern is exclusively and successfully used by all Persian muleteers, men who spend their lives on the road, and do practi cally all the carrying trade of the country. British officers tra velling in Persia all speak favourably of the shoe, especially for mules, though for horses opinions differ. Taking everything into consideration, it would appear that animals, required to work over dry, rocky, stony ground would best be shod with the Persian pattern, while those working over wet, muddy, soft ground, or piquetted in permanent standings, which are liable to get damp and foul, should be shod with the ordinary shoe. The approximate amount of supplies and transport likely to be available, under favourable conditions, in the principal districts and places, is briefly as follows:— Section I.— N. E. Persia.

Horses for light cavalry 250, and for pack work 700, ordnance mules 120, baggage mules 400, are obtainable at short notice. At certain seasons a large amount of grazing exists at the head of the Meshed valley about Chinaran and Radkan. Postal waggons, carriages and horses (8 available at each stage to Tehran) are obtainable at Meshed city. A constant stream of fourgons conveys goods to and from Askhabad, and a lesser number to and from Tehran. Bujnurd-—Grain is plentiful 7,000 kharrdrs are normally Bui nurd, available for export.

There are 200 families of Russian mujiks, living close outside Sarakhs, who possess a hundred four-horse and four-wheeled fourgons. These are all re gistered for service by Russia, and could carry troops from Tejen to Sarakhs in tw'O days, if necessary. Turkomans living in the vicinity possess 2,000 horses and 2,000 camels. These animals are also registered, but would not be available to immediately for service as the mujiks’ fourgons. Chinaran usually has 0,000 Icharvars of grain surplus, for export, also rice and chopped straw'; transport for hire,—camels 200, mules 100, and donkeys 100. Radkan possesses 4,000 cattle, 20,000 sheep and goats, and of wheat and barley a good surplus ; transport for hire- camels 500, mules 400, donkeys 200. Khaf produces grain (| wheat and J barley) amounting to about 9,300 tons, with a considerable surplus for export. Ani mals are estimated at, cattle 2,000, sheep 26,000, goats 14,000, mules 92, donkeys 2,398, camels 583, horses 262. Bakharz produces wheat, barley, tugi, millet, and melons. Animals available 40,000 sheep, 8,000 cattle, 1,500 donkeys, and 500 camels. Turbat-i-Haidari has a surplus output of wheat and bar ley of 15,000 Tcharvars, which goes to Yazd and Kirman ; fruit, chopped straw, and lucerne are plentiful ; sheep 70,000, goats 50,000, cattle 8,200, horses 2,000, camels 2,400, donkeys 14,150, mules 400. Tursluz supplies grain, chopped straw, and fruits, all abundantly. Animals available—horses 1,000, mules 500, don keys 6,700 and camels 3,000. The chief wealth of Tabas district lies in sheep and camels. Transport available for hire or purchase camels 3,000, mules and ponies 1,000, donkeys 2,000. Grain grown here is insuffi cient for local requirements, and more has to be imported from Dastgardun and Gunabad. Dates are abundant, and there is a quantity of fruit. Fuel has to be brought from distant hills. There is a good supply of fowls and vegetables.Tun could furnish supplies for a considerable force for a Tun. long time. Camels and sheep are numerous ; horses scarce. The agricultural produce of Nishapur, consisting chiefly of Nisha P ur * rice, millet, barley, wheat, cotton, fruits, is plentiful. Trans port animals are—horses 2,600, mules 1,600, donkeys 13,000, camels 4,500. The annual output of grain (f wheat and l barley), in the Sar-i-Vilayat district of Sar-i-Viiayat, gives a surplus of 48,000 Indian maunds, which are exported to Sabzawar and Meshed. Transport avail able for hire camels 200, mules and ponies 100, donkeys 200. Sabzawar produces 20,400 Icharvdrs of grain annually, Sabzawar. which is insufficient for local requirements, and is supplemented from Nishapur and Sar-i-Vilayat. Transport available for hire— camels 2,000, donkeys, 200. Kaln has sometimes to import grain from Khaf to supple- Ka i n&gt; ment local productions. There are 1,000 horses, 4,500 camels, about 600,000 sheep and goats, 10,000 cattle and 30,000 donkeys in the district. Average prices are, goats 10—15 krdns, sheep 15—25 krdns, and cattle 100—200 krdns. Section II.— N. W, Persia. The resources of the district of Astarabad alone could Astarabad. hardly support a large force for any length of time ; and it could not be relied on for a base, whence a large continuous supply for a distant expedition could be collected. Improvements of communications should lead to a great extension of corn-grow ing area, and capabilities for supply. Rice is extensively cul tivated in the west and along the Caspian shore, and a good sup ply would be available. The Guklan and Yamut chrmurs grow a»considerable amount of wheat beyond their require ments. Having regard to the great fertility of the soil, the am ple water-supply, and the climate, the products might be mul tiplied twenty-fold under a good administration. In the i )ha rud-Bustan district there is much cultivation, Shah mainly fruit, cotton, and silk; but food grains produced are Bustan - only sufficient for local consumption ; the output of grain is reckoned at 150,000 Indian maunds. There are 7,000 camels 200 mules and ponies and 5,000 donkeys. In Shahrud town very good boots and shoes are manufactured,Mazandaran Gilan. Azarbaijan. Mughan. Sinnehi Kirmanshah. The products of Mazaudaran are chiefly rice, sugar, cotton and fruits. Gilan closely resembes Mazandaran. Rice is the staple food, and its cultivation has lately much increased, and become of paramount importance. There are very valuable fisheries all along the Caspian coast, and the timber from the forests of these provinces is a great source of wealth. No horses, only small stout ponies are available ; but numbers of cattle, sheep and poultry. Azarbaijan produces wheat, barley, opium, maize, rye, flax, hemp, madder, fruit, cotton and tobacco. In corn its re sources are said to be practically unlimited, and large amounts are annually exported to supply the deficiencies of other dis tricts. There are large herds of sheep and goats, and a consi derable amount of wool is produced. Large numbers of cattle, mules, horses and camels are reported. It cannot be said to be a rich fuel or timber bearing district. Mughan is a celebrated plain in Azarbaijan, which extends from the neighbourhood of Ardabil to the mouths of the River Kur. It is roughly 210 miles in length and 70 in breadth, and its rich soil and luxuriant pastures seem to have made it the favourite encamping ground of most Eastern conquerors. The country around Sinneh is well watered and well culti vated, and abundant supplies of all sorts are procurable at cheap rates. Near the town the water-supply is limited, but there are numerous camping places where water is abundant in the neighbouring hills. The great industry of Kirmanshah city and its neigh bourhood is agriculture. The total output of wheat and barley for the province in a normal year gives a surplus of some 80,000 tons, after supplying the needs of a population of 350,000. All sorts of supplies are procurable in large quantities. There is an extensive trade in wool here ; and, besides carpets, tent covers, saddlebags, ropes and yarns are manufactured. The trade in skins is also large. This is a great mule breeding district; the three principal mule-breeders are ’All Murad of Kirmanshah, Baud Khan, chief of the Kalhur Kurds, and Shir Khan of Zubaidi. The month of March appears to be the best time for purchasing here. The average price for mules lately was ordnance Rs, 240, baggage Rs, 155, transport Rs, 150, buta rise in price was anticipated, Mules of the Sinjavl strain are bred in considerable numbers in the north and north west of this district. They appear lighter boned, and less hardy than the Luristan animal, probably because they are bred from mares of pure Arab blood. The Sinjavi mule has the doubtful advantage of being prairie fed, while the Luristan mule has to clamber about rocks for his living. The charvadurs' mules are never worth purchasing here, or, in fact, anywhere in Persia, as from an early age they are overloaded and over worked. The town of Hamadan has very fertile plains around it. The Hamadan. district is said to produce 40,200 hharvdrs of wheat and bar ley, which is very cheap. The tanneries here are famous and hdes are imported from all over Persia, so a supply of leather should be available. Good felt carpets are manufactured. There are large numbers of mules for hire or purchase, also ponies, and some Arab horses. Camels also can be procured. Burujird district has the reputation of having the finest Burujird. pastures in Persia. A good breed of Arab horse is reared here, and a certain number of mules. Of the latter, large numbers are always passi ig through on the numerous caravan routes, which radiate from the town. Charcoal and fuel are plentiful. In the province of Isfahan wheat is grown in great abun- Tafalian. dance ; the chief supply of grain is derived from the districts of Chehar Mahal and Faridan. The amount of grain cultivation in the districts is very large, and Yazd, Kashan and other smaller districts are supplied from here. As a rule there is sufficient store in hand to supply the district for at least two years. Rice is rather scarce, but fruit and vegetables are plentiful. Shaflal and lucerne grass for horses is grown in great quantities. The transport consists of mules, camels and donkeys. The mules are mainly bred by the BakhtdarTs who also breed some horses, sturdy, strong, and good on the hillside. Donkeys are every where numerous. Camels are bred in the south, and about the villages near the desert. The Sarah Arabs living north of Nam and east of Ardistan, alone own, it is said, 15,000 camels, and also 10,000 sheep and 20,000 goats. Owing to the number of main roads, transport animals of every description are always passing through the province. The entire crops of Yazd in a good year only suffice for Yazd. three months’ supply of the city. Supplementary supplies of190 I t Ira^-i-Ajam^ South-western Persia. breadstuff-; are drawn from Khorasan, Fars and Isfahan. Ar ticles of food in daily use are fairly cheap. The main source of transport is the camel, with a few mules and donkeys. In the town and district are some 5,090 camels, owned by local inhabi tants, and almost entirely employed in the southern trade All mules are brought from outside, none are bred in the district. Donkeys are numerous, and chiefly employed locally, hm good horses are bred in the province ; they arc imported and no stock is kept, there being no pasturage for mares and foals. Build ing and building materials are cheaper than in most places, Timber is imported from the neighbouring hills. The supply and transport of’Iraq-i-Ajam maybesummar- ised as followsArrangements for supplies for troops can easily be made, at any time of year, at the following places : Kirmcn- shah Sinneh, Bliar, Hamadan, Zin’an, oaqqiz, Khurramabad, Burujird, Daulatabad, Kang war, Sultanabad, Khunsar, Isfah n and Shiraz. All sorts of supplies are plentiful in these towns. There are besides several smaller towns and large villages capable of furnishing some supplies. For cattle and mules P^nty of barley and grass are to be had at these pla:es. Sneep and ghi are also procurable. The prevailing custom in all Persian towns and villages, however small, is to collect and keep a sufficient supply to last for the four winter months. Firewood is, however, generally scarce, except in the Pusht-i-Kuh and round Khurramabad. Charcoal is not plentiful. Grass fodder for mules is very scarce in the jungle ; but for camels and cattle fodder or sorts can be procured. The people also store fodder for the four vum ter months and any village is sure to have at least 500 to 1,000 hharvars During the winter snows, animals are kept m houses, in Zt Place, in this area, there is a good water-supply, and the tracks from village to village might, with little labour, b, made fit for wheels.

The consensus of local opinion, however, is that a regular and moderate demand would encourage breeding and not affect caravan traffic ; while, on the contrary, an irregular demand for large numbers would clo little to encourage breeding, and would certainly affect trans port rates on the caravan roads. It is true that it is reckoned that the numbers of mules, working on the Bushire-Shfraz road, decreased from 7,000 in 1905 to less than 3,000 in 1908, but this is probably due entirely to the disturbed state of the country, and insecurity of the roads. There was also, in 1908, a decrease on the Lynch road. It may be remembered that a supplementary market Baghdad, to south-western Persia for mules exists at Baghdad. Though it is calculated that barely 200 are bred in one year in the plains of Mesopotamia, some 700—800 are imported from Persia evey year, chiefly from the Kurdistan hills. Thus a market is formed. It is estimated that there are about 5,000 mules used for pack purposes in that country and a large number more for draught in the various carriage ser vices. It may be added that there are usually some 1,500 horses in Baghdad, out of which about 500 may be for sale, and by giving notice it is calculated that at least 1,000 horses could be brought up for purchase in one year. They might possibly be serviceable as Indian cavalry remounts, but the majority are light of bone, and it would probably be cheaper to buy direct in Bombay. In Luristan, to the south-west, on the lower slopes of the Luristan. mountains, are found the principal grazing grounds. Com paratively speaking, the province is extremely well wooded, more particularly on the east. There are numbers of all kinds of fruit trees. The Lurs are very wasteful of the timber supply, and use a great deal for the making of charcoal, which they sell. They cultivate scarcely enough to provide for their own needs, and the country is normally in a state of lawlessness. Khurramabad is the only town in Luristan ; rice in small Khurramabad. quantities, and wheat and barley are cultivated round it. There are many rich gardens and from June to September fruits and vegetables, of all kinds and of excellent quality, are in great abundance,192 Pusht-i-Kuh. Arabistan. Puslit-i-Kuh is very sparsely inhabited by a nomadic population. As regards supplies, sufficient rice and grain for local requirements are grown in fertile valleys, which are surrounded by steep inaccessible mountains. Reports state that, except at the Vali’s camp, there is great difficulty in obtaining supplies, especially grain and fodder. Mule breeding is the chief occupa tion, but very few mules are to be seen ; it is said that they are bred in large numbers in preference to other stock. The most re liable information states that there are only two, or at the most three, large mule owners in the country, one of whom is the Vali himself, and the greater number of the mules are brought from the Sagvand and Khurramabad districts. The following points must be considered :— (1) There is a great deal of unsoundness among the Pusht-i- Kuh mules. (2) Very many are too young for Government purposes. (3) The people are all nomads, and consequently must keep a great number of mules for their own transport, many there fore, will only sell for a price that enables them to buy young mules elsewhere, and at the same time make a good profit. The yearly numbers probably obtainable under prevent conditions and requirements are as follows :— Paying present or peace price— Transport 250, and ordnance 100. Paying war prices, (30—40 per cent, more than above), Transport 450 and ordnance 150, Many mules are sent down from all parts of south-wes tern Persia, to the country to the north of Badrai, for grazing purposes during the cold weather. Grazing fees are paid to the Vali in certain districts. It is reported that northern ’Arabistan could support about 20,000 men and animals ; Shushtar, Dizful and Ramuz being the main centres of supply. Fodder and salt are obtainable, and vegetables in season, at these places. Sheep and goats are plentiful, but have to be collected from the district, as there is no grazing near the towns,Generally speaking, southern Arabistan is capable of sup plying a force of 10,000 men and animals for an indefinite period. Fallahieh and Ram Hormuz are the main centres where food stuffs, barley, wheat and rice are grown. Muhammareh is well supplied by river importations. There is a great dearth of mills for grinding corn. Surplus wheat is exported to Europe, and in winter and spring, stocks in the country are apt to run low. Transport available in the country would be insufficient to enable foodstuffs to be collected at any spot without consider able assistance from outside. River and sea communication being ample, extra supplies could easily be imported. Meso potamia is rich in grain produce and conveniently near and accessible. Rodder is always scarce in Muhammareh. Pressed fodder for two months should be brought from India, To supply troops up the river, bedlams, carrying 5 tons, are available in large numbers at Muhammareh and Ealla- hleh, and also at Basrah. They can be towed by hand as far as Deh Mulla, from Hindian and Khalafabad, from Muham mareh and from Buzieh. For transport, water communications are good ; but camels, mules and donkeys are few. Ram Hormuz is a centre for muleteers, and, with complusion and sudden action, might produce 500 mules, Shushtar 1,000 mules and 100 horses, Dizful 1,000 mules and 500 horses. Muhammareh is not a centre for animal transport, 1,000 camels could be obtained, but only if the authorities were favourable. Eallahieh might furnish 100 mules. Horses are extensively used by the Arabs and under severe compulsion about 5,000 might be obtained. They are poor in appearance and not of the class exported to India, but are endur ing, and improve when properly fed. A force landing should bring its own horses, and most, if not all, of its mules. To collect mules in the country would mean a delay of at least a month. For general use in Arabistan the mule is more suitable than the camel, as water and fodder can generally be obtained every day, whilst camel grazing is scarce. Dizful can always be depended on for a large supply of J grain, meat and firewood. In spring it is celebrated for its pastures. As a centre of the mule supply of Persia it is important. A certain number of working mules of 31 years are used here for cultivation, and a limited number for trans port work, A further small supply might be obtained from194 Shush tar. Ahwaz. the Arab tribes near Susa. A sudden demand for purchase, of any number of working mules exceeding 200, could not easily be met. It is estimated that, under favourable conditions, 1,000 mules and 300 camels with professional drivers could be hired here at short notice. Dizffil is a good mule market for young stock up to 21 years old. The mule-breeders of Western Persia are the Lurs, not ably the Sagwand. The latter are said to own young stock to the number of over 2,000 at the commencement of their selling season, viz., December. They come down yearly to Dizful to dispose of their stock to buyers from all parts, chiefly the Bakhtiari who re-sell later on near Isfahan. The capabilities for supply yearly, of Dizffil and the Lur Iliats, are estimated at 200 mules of 3|- years and upwards, and 1,000 of 18 months to years. Supplies for Shushtar are drawn chiefly from the Mianab. Food stuffs and forage are not really abundant, but there are considerable stocks of both in good years, and also of fuel. No market exists for mules, but a limited number are used for agricultural purposes, and a few are engaged in the carrying trade with Dizful and Isfahan. About 25, of 3| years and upwards, might be purchased annually. There are 20 mills here for grinding corn. Camels are not numerous in the Shushtar and Ahwaz districts though some are employed in the Ahwaz-Isfahan traffic. Mules are numerous and are in the hands of guilds of muleteers, each man owning 3 to 10 mules, but working together and accept ing collective contracts. There is little doubt that, in the event of military operations, if it were possible to hire the animals, it would be the most economical course. The normal rate from Ahwaz to Isfahan is 3'90 krdns, and on the return jouney l'95 krdns per shah man. Each mule carries about 300 lbs., in addition to saddle and line gear, and will march 20 to 30 miles a day without ex haustion. Donkeys are very numerous, each nomad family pos sessing 5 or 6. Probably 95 per cent, of the traffic in grain and flour, from country to town, is carried on the backs of these animals. They do 16 to 24 miles a day, carrying 100 to 150 lbs., by tracks over which horses cannot be ridden. About 1,000 donkeys could possibly be collected from the country districts.195 Supplies of any sort are not procurable at Muhammareh, except in very small quantities. The staple food here consists of dates. With time available, flour and sheep could be brought in, but sheep are difficult to procure between the middle of December and end of February. Cattle could be obtained during the latter period. There is an ice factory, capable of turning out half a ton of ice daily, and one flour mill Vegetables are grown in small quantities, and in autumn a good supply of fruits. Fish are procurable; there is practically no milk. Of fuel there is no local supply, but it can be brought down the Karan m boats from a jungle some way up-stream Kerosene oil could be supplied from the Oil Company’s depot containing 60,000 cases of oil. Land transport is non-existent! All transport, and practically all communication, is by river or by road. Mounted troops marching from here to Ahwaz could not count on finding grazing for horses. Forage supplies should be brought from India, and the troops supplied by boats on the Karun keeping level with them. Chopped straw is occasionally plentiful after a good harvest, but is an uncertain quantity. A ear Khur Musa, Buzieh has usually a plentiful supply of barley, com and fuel, but fodder is very scarce. Ma’shur has sometimes a supply of barley and corn, but it is often scanty, fodder is usually very hmited in quantity and fuel practically unobtainable, and has to be imported in boats. It is estimated that the Bakhtiari Garmslr should in £ norma! year, supply a force of 6,500 men and their transpor, with food, gram, fodder, etc. Wheat, rice and barley are the only grains obtainable m any quantity.; , Dates are available m large quantities ; milk and butter in small quantities, ghi h very limited, and dhal not obtainable at all. Sheep and goats would always be plentiful from November to March when the nomads are m the Garmsir, and probably all the ye’ar round £ sufficient quantity could be obtained. Beef could be procurec occasionally, but cattle are usually only slaughtered when dyinc jT ? d , age and dlsease - Though corn is fairly plentiful, it is difficult to get it ground; mills exist on all streams, but hand mihs are a necessity. fe SmaIl quantities of excellent mineral oi Ramuz^oad fr ° m ^ 0l1 springs ” on tlle Shush tar- Muhammanln Khur Musa. Bakhfciari country.196 Pack animals and horses are fed on barley and bhusa, there being no hay. The nomad tribes have no arrangements for pre serving bhiisa, the straw being piled together on the ground and left to rot. In most large villages there are stores of barley and wheat, the collected tribute of the neighbourhood. This could be taken without inconveniencing the inhabitants, who would sell other things more willingly, if their own private stores of grain were spared. Green fodder is obtainable in small quantities, in March and April of normal years. The crops are entirely dependent on the rainfall. Grazing is good from March to the end of May; from the latter date the green shoots of the reeds are eaten with avidity as a good substitute. As regards transport, camels are not numerous; but mules of good quality could be hired in large numbers, if circumstances Were favourable. Donkeys, of a hardy useful type, are very numerous, and large numbers could be collected. The mule teers would not willingly sell their animals, but would probably be quite ready to hire. Here the mule saddle is only removed for a few minutes, while the animal is being groomed, and serves to keep it warm at night. Sore backs are frequent, but do not prevent the animal working and carrying heavy loads. The saddle {palun) is strong, requires no cleaning, offers a large bearing surface, prevents an awkward load galling the animal, minimizes pressure on the ribs by spreading it over a larger area, and enables loads to be placed high. Muleteers load their animals skilfully and well, using a long rope and surcingle. Mules are picketted by tying their head ropes to a long rope pegged to the ground. A curry-comb is kept for every 5 or 6 mules. Every muleteer has his packing needle and thread, and each mule a feeding bag holding 3 or 4 lbs. of bhusa. Total weight of gear is 50 to 60 lbs. Donkey gear is similar but lighter. Muleteers shoe their own mules, and a set of shoeing tools is carried for every 30 to 40 mules. In the Bakhtiarl country, with the exception of the Ahwaz- Isfahan route, all roads between the highlands and lowlands pass through country deserted by ihe tribes in summer and occupied in winter. On the Shushtar-Isfahan road from Gutwand onwards it is difficult to obtain provisions after May 15th, till over the Chari pass. This is still more the case in the Gil-i-Shah and Htflranies. iHfonlldema! itSialiiecessar BtkiSO sniri as. Oe tk L' slwiiprokb!

It is difficult, however, to imagine a situation which would demand a force following such routes, unless provid ed with all necessary supplies. No supplies can be relied on for more than 50 animals on these tracks, and then only at certain stages. On the Lynch road it is estimated that transport ani mals would probably be obtainable in two months as follows : — (a) For the lower stages, camels from Kuwait, 6,000 ; mules from Shushtar and Dizful, a doubtful 2,000. There are generally 100 mules at Ahwaz. (b) For the higher stages, from the Chehar Mahal and Isfahan, 250 camels, and 2,500 mules could possib ly be procured. Iliats require all their transport for at least two months in spring and two months in autumn, during their migrations. Pack bullocks are practically unobtainable. Persian shoeing can be done at Ahwaz and Ramuz. Supplies (barley and bJiv.sa), probably sufficient for 100 men and 500 animals for one day, are laid down at most stages, but not all; and during May, before the new crops are harvested, there is a difficulty almost anywhere. At Ahwaz with 15 days’ notice sufficient for 1,000 men could be had, or without notice for 200. After Naghan, stage 12, the country is productive, but arrangements in advance are necessary. Fuel would have to be collected at all stages. Sheep and cattle are very numerous, but they are a moving item, and not available in the same place all the year round. Generally, opinions concur that it would be safer to rely on Indian resources at first; the country supplies would probably be available later. Further information about’arrangements on the Lynch road will be found in Chapter VII, Strategical places. It is difficult to estimate the numbers of sheep, goats and cattle in the whole BakhtiarT country, but there are said to be nearly half a million sheep and goats, while cattle also are very numerous. Horses, though weedy, are well adapted to the country, but are not available in any numbers. No mules are, by report, bred in the Chehar Mahal, but there are many in use,198 Kuhgalu country. Shiraz. and young stock are grazed there. Altogether about 8,000 are fit for immediate transport purposes. There is a very limited number of camels. The Kiihgalu country is well watered, well wooded and fertile; but each valley only grows sufficient for its own needs. Little grain is grown and the surplus for sale is small; large caravans would have difficulty in obtaining supplies. A reserve of grain should, therefore, be carried. For mules the excellent grazing would suffice, during the brief periods when no grain is obtainable. There are few horses, mules and donkeys; the people are not all migratory and therefore do not need many. Mules are not bred, but frequently stolen from the Bakhtiari road. Bullocks are used for local transport in limited numbers. The vicinity of Shiraz is exceedingly fertile; cereals, vines, melons and vegetables of all kinds are extensively cultivated; in fact, it is considered that the supplies would suffice for a divi sion in normal years. From a circle of 60 miles round Shiraz, a crop of 20,000,000 Tabriz mans (6| lbs.) is assumed, but locusts have been known to reduce this by Aths. Postal waggons are now available between Shiraz and Is fahan, and camels as well as mules are able to do transport work on this section, but not on the Shiraz-Bushire section. Generally ■speaking, on the plateau the camel is the transport animal. It appears that horses have become much more scarce, in Fars, and the Q^shqai tribes are said no longer to breed the numbers they used to. In 1892 they had 6,000 to 7,000 horses, mostly mares, a number of mules and donkeys, a celebrated breed of cattle and very large flocks of sheep hnd goats. A purchasing officer might now secure in Shiraz 50 to 100 strong hardy horses, suitable for mounted infantry; but the transaction would require three months or so. Formerly 1,000 mules could have been purchased in Fars from the nomads; this is now very doubtful. Between Shiraz and Bandar ’Abbas the donkey is used almost universally for transport; camels are sel dom met with, and mules still more seldom. These donkeys carry 200 lbs., occasionally more. Although the province of Fars is in many places quite incapable of supporting a brigade of troops for the shortest period, the following places are noteworthy for supply.Krazabad would make a good supply depot. The whole Firuzabad of the surrounding plain is extremely fertile and is one of the best corn-producing and grazing districts in Persia. There are about 50 horses and ponies in the town, and some thousands of donkeys could be collected. The Ilkhani of the Qashqal tribe lives here, and could give much assistance, especially in the supply of live stock. Jahrfim is not surrounded by such fertile country, but Jahrum. considerable supplies could be collected here, such as cattle, sheep, goats, grain, bhasa, dates (in large quantities), fruit and vegetables. Firewood is procurable from moderate distances. For transport there are numbers of donkeys available, very few mules, and some ponies of a good stamp. The plain about Fasa is another very fertile well-watered Fasa. area. It produces wheat, barley and also Indian com, millet and a small quantity of rice. In the town, fruit, vegetables, and lucerne grass are plentiful. Nirlz has a great stretch of corn cultivation (barley and Niriz. wheat), and fruit and vegetables are also grown. There are a few horses, numbers of donkeys, but scarcely any mules. With regard to the supplies of Bushire and the neighbour- Bushire. hood, it may be noted that in the Persian War of 1856-57 the opinion formed was that they had been under estimated. There were, then, 4,000 to 5,000 Indians and 1,000 horses living there independent of the commissariat; while the enemy appeared to reckon on being able to concentrate 8,000 infantry and 2,000 cavalry in one spot across the plains The cereals grown on the peninsula are wheat and barley. The quantity of corn, purchasable at any particular moment, is probably from 5 to 20 tons of wheat, and 3 to 15 tons of barley. If the crops are good, the available corn, from the mainland, would be 800 to 1,000 tons. The harvest is generally reaped in May, sometimes at the end of April. The mills are worked by hand. An expeditionary force would have to bring all its sup plies with it. See page 292. A demand for rations for 400 coolies could be met at any moment but for a larger number, or for a prolonged period.200 special arrangements would be necessary, which would depend on the abundance, or otherwise, of the last local harvest. The inhabitants eat rice, wheat and meat. In the bazaars are procurable meat, fish, vegetables, rice, ghi, flour and dates. Milk is not drunk, nor obtainable to any great extent. Fish are caught in large quantities, the supply being greater in winter than summer. There is scarcely any land left for grazing in Bushire, but hay and fodder are brought in, as required, from the neighbouring districts, where the inhabitants store it. This supply depends on the season and ranges from nil in a rainless season, to fodder for about 500 animals for a month in a good one. There are no special coal godowns. Charcoal is in general use, but that maintained in store only suffices for the immediate needs of the inhabitants. Large quantities can be obtained from a village in the interior, distant about 24 miles. The local shipping obtain fuel from the Bushire market. _ Firewood is brought from Persian ports, as well as from districts in the interior; none is grown about Bushire. The British Naval Coal Depot contains ordinarily 1,500 to 2,000 tons of best Welsh coal. A small quantity is occasionally held by the agents of the British India Steam Navigation Company, and regularly by those of the Anglo-Algerian Steam Navigation Company, There are no bulk oil depots. For meat supplies, sheep and goats are plentiful; but oxen are scarce and small. Mules are generally used for transport work from Bushire. The numbers frequenting the port daily vary from 100 to 800 mules. There are also donkeys and camels, but no ox transport. The villagers about Bushire have practically no transport. The mules available are the property of muleteers, who spend their whole time on the roads in the interior. They are always on the move except in the grazing season (15th March to 15th May), when the animals are turned out to graze, and are not obtainable in any numbers. Even caravans on the road, at this time, move very slowly, allowing tiieir animals to graze as they march. The number available a Bushire at any moment, depends entirely on the condition ol trade; as the roads become unsafe for trade during a period ot political confusion, so the number of mules coming - Bushire dwindles.At Lingeli, crops of barley and wheat are sown in September and October, which ripen in January and February, and in March are harvested. In a good year 20 to 30,000 mans (9 lbs.) of wheat, and 90 to 100,000 mans of barley are reaped in the vicinity, but it is of poor quality. Owing to the laziness of the people, and their fear of deficient rainfall, much land, that is suitable for cultivation, lies fallow. From the shops in the. bazaar can be provided wheat, barley, {jhi, flour, sugar etc., sufficient for the needs of the inhabitants ; but,with a month’s notice, supplies could probably be arranged for a force of 2,000 men with followers and transport. The consumption of meat here is small, but much fish is eaten. Flour is imported in proportion to the amount of wheat locally available, and in a year of little rainfall, wheat and barley are imported from India and up-Gulf ports. Vegetables are exceedingly scarce, in the cold season a few are obtainable. D ates are grown in considerable quantities, but limes, oranges and fruits generally are imported from ’Oman, Mlnab and Bandar ’Abbas. There are some 700 milch cows in the district; little milk is drunk, but much ghi is made. Cattle are not sold. Fish are procurable in practically unlimited quantities and are caught in nets by the local boatmen. There is no grazing in the vicinity of the landing place, and in the whole district it is very scarce. Grass and leak (chopped straw) are stored in godowhs as a reserve against bad seasons. In a good year 150,000 mans (9 lbs.) of kah, and about 30,000 rolls (2 lbs. approx.) of grass are obtainable; this is about suffi cient for the needs of local animals. In bad years, kah and grass are imported from Bandar Dllam, Bandar Rig, and other up-Gulf ports. There are no coal stores; firewood is always scarce and is brought from Qishm island, the Batineh Coast of’Oman, and the mangrove swamps in Clarence Straits. There are no oil stores. Donkeys are the usual transport animals ; there are a few camels but mules are rarely seen.202 Caravans seldom visit Lingeli, and no transport animals are for sale. Some 30 or 40 camels are imported annually from ’Oman or Qatar, to meet local requirements. Donkeys are imported from Bahrain, Qatar, and the Batineh Coast, but are only suffi cient for local needs. Laristan is about the most barren and unproductive pro vince in Persia. Section IV.— S.-E. Persia. Transport in There is no wheeled transport in Southern and South-Eastern South-Eastern d Persia. Where water and forage are available, the mule is the Persia. General and fastest animal; but in Eastern and South-Eastern uote3, Persia, the scarcity of fodder and water make the use of the camel imperative. For a comparatively desert country with minimum loads, donkey caravans would be useful, and move quicker than camels. For employment with his own animals, the- Persian caravan man is excellent, but merely in charge of animals, not his own pro perty, much supervision and tact would be necessary. His endurance and stamina are marvellous and his wants as regards food and clothing very small. He is usually accustomed to handle arms, and a Martini-Henry carbine is the most suitable weapon, if desirable to arm him. He treats his animals with great care and kindness. The length of marches is dependent on the water supply, the first march is always made short, and subsequent ones average about 20 miles; 30 to 35 miles is not unusual for a long march. For equipment, an ample supply of ropes should be brought with a force. The supply could probably be kept up with black goat-hair ropes in the country. Commissariat gunni sacks are only obtainable in small numbers ; the Persian sack is much too heavy. Jlwols could be made up in large quantities in any Persian town. Yahddns of the Indian pattern are_ most suitable for camel and mule transport, none are procurable in the country. Caravanmen dislike any article weighing over 100 lbs. For watering purposes provision must be made for drawing water from wells, sometimes very deep. Picks, shovels, crowbars ami galvanised buckets are necessary for clearing out existing203 wells. For uso in Persia the commissariat galvanized iron water tank is most satisfactory. In the districts of Persian Baluchistan the camel alone is used for transport purposes. For military operations the Persian camel would be superior to the Indian camel, as it is used to the longest journeys, is accustomed to work out of its own locality, can do without regular grazing and exists on bhusx and other portable food. With every camel caravan are always one or two donkeys ; these at halting places, fetch the fodder for the camels, and carry the camelmen on the road. In Southern Persia camels average 2| miles an hour on good roads. On the march, when grazing is scarce, camels are fed on bhiisl, lucerne grass, cotton-seed, dates, and wheat or barley meal, supplemented by other items. They will drink the vilest salt water. The Jaz Murian Hamun, Bampur, Khusp, Sirjan and Bavanat are all good centres for purchasing camels. The camels of Rudbar are a particularly good class. Riding camels are almost universally used in Baluchistan instead of horses. They can cover 40 miles a day under favourable conditions. Tim ox is little used for transport in these parts. In Narmashlr district a few might be purchased, 500 at the outside. In Persia the place of the cooly is taken by the ubiquitous donkey. In the Kirman district the supplies produced are Kirman , wheat, barley, millet, beet-root and peas. In the Garmsir, rice and maize are the summer crops. Many kinds of fruits and vegetables are grown in the province. The most fertile sub- districts are Bam, Narmaslnr, Rudbar, where there is excellent grazing, and Jiraft; the richness and fertility of these is im portant with reference to Bandar ’Abbas. Camels, bred in the district and in Khorasan, form the chief means of transport, mules arc few, but donkeys very numerous. Returns for the whole province show nearly 20,000 camels, of which 15,000 are owned by the Rudbari tribes. Donkeys are estimated at 24,000.204 Bandar 'Abbas. Persian Balu chistan. Dates, barley and wheat arc the main crops within a radius of 50 miles from Bandar ’Abbas; wheat is not largely grown The grain harvest is in April and May, and the date' harvest in August and September. There are no arrangements for grinding corn, except small stones in every hut. No crops are grown in the immediate vicinity of Bandar ’Abbas. In an average year, with a month’s notice, sufficient grain for a force of 7,000 men with followers and transport could probably be collected. Quantities of dates should be available With a week’s notice, the bazaars could probably meet the demand of a force of 2,000 men, with followers and transport, for a week or 10 days. Vegetables are scarce; limes and water melons are the only fruits procurable. Milk is scarce and mostly from goats. Fish is abundant. There is no grazing at all, and fodder is very scarce, especially during October^ November and December. Bhusd and barley are stored in small quantities to meet local requirements. Camels graze 14 miles out, beyond Baghu. _ Fuel is scanty; thffie is no large coal store nearer than Basldu, and firewood is scarce, expensive and usually imported from Clarence Strait. A small coal depot exists at Qishm town, for tho supply of the Persian Customs steamer and launches, 100 tons at most would be available. Fairly large quantities of cheap Russian kerosene oil are obtainable in the bazar, also candles in largo quantities. During November and April large numbers of camels and donkeys are available; the camels are mostly Afghan with Afghan owners, and some times number 2,000 to 3,000. Many of them are connected with the subsidized camel cadres at Quetta and in Sistan. Mules, pomes and oxen are not obtainable. In the hot season (May to October), it is often extremely difficult to collect even 20 camels. Owing to scarcity of transport, rates for hire are abrays very high. No transport animals are owned by the local 'inhabi tants, and owners from up country will not sell them. In Persian Baluchistan the inhabitants only cultivate suffi cient for their own wants, and sometimes, owing to exactions of Persian officials and want of water, not even that. Crops of wheat, barley, rice, etc., are met with everywhere in small quantities. Bampur is capable of producing great quantities of grain, and even now has a surplus of dates, yhi and grain. blofecounti sMreeding.

Transport work is mainly conducted by means of camels of which a fair number are available in the interior. Donkeys are universal as beasts of burden.

In a favourable season, after good rainfall, the local supplies of sheep, goats, q7u and fodder might suffice to maintain a force of 1,500 men, except in the Dashtlarl and Bahu Kalat districts where water is bitter, and a detachment of even !00 men would be supplied with difficulty. In the hills sup plies at all times are not so inadequate. Water, slightly brackish can generally be obtained even in hot weather from holes in torrent beds, or from tanks called Stags filled by rainfall. The attir are not common on the coast, but there are 8 between Chahbar and Gwatar. Pack transport is only obtainabh to a Jim]tea extent throughout the country. Ihe Geh district is reported to contain patches of culti vation, and water is said to be generally good. Supplies and orage for a force of 1,500 men, with transport, should be forth coming all the year'round. _ It is calculated that the resources of the Qasrqand dis trict might support a force of 1,000 men. • i the corn raised is barely sufficient for the few j aS k inhabitants ; a supply might be requisitioned from the Minab dis trict. Other supplies are practically unobtainable. Fish in limit ed quantity is obtainable at times. Mangrove for camels can be had, but no fodder for other animals.

Camel grazing is abundant throughout the year. Grass is unobtainable. Fodder can be bought in from the interior in large quantities. Fuel is very scarce. °The camel and donkey are the only animals used for trans port purposes. The Makran camel carries 5 maunds and marches 15 miles a day. Marching is usually done in the morning and afternoon, a halt being made m the d ay for grazing. With a month’s notice 2,000 to 3,000 camels at most could be collected. Supply and transport at Tiz are as at Chahbar. The returns for 1903-04 show that in Sistan ^128,597 acres were cultivated for spring crops, and only 20,3o2 acrei for autumn crops. The principal spring crops are wheat and barley, grown in the proportion of 8 to 3; these grains are the staple products of the country. The harvest is about loth May to 15th June, only the upper halves of the stalks are cut, and tied into small bundles. Little or no value is attached to the stalks as fodder, as the number of horses in the country is small, and grass and grazing for cattle and flocks abundant. Only in winter is bhus 2 used as a feed. In early spring the cornfields abound with wild spinach (sabzi), which at times forms the only supply of green vegetable. The principal autumn crops are water-melons, millet, maize, cotton and various vegetables. Water-melons constitute one of the principal articles of food of the •inhabitants throug i- out half the year, and estimates in 1904, an exceptionally ha year’ show 33,000,000 produced. These melons begin to ripen and become available for consumption about the last week in June, and are eaten as food till the end of February, water channels, between the rows of melons are a characteris tic feature of the country, and the vicinity of villages is ahuy cutup with a network of them. They are cut across the paths, without the least regard for the convemenceol travel. lers and are a great obstruction to traffic. Good cairots turnips are available in November and December.

The quality is very good. Qfii from goat’s milk is preferred locally to that from cow’s milk. Assuming that the daily requirements in grain of a division, with first and second line transport and supply columns, amounts in round numbers to 700 Indian maunds, and that the grain available in the country in normal years for their sub sistence amounts to 500,000 maunds, then the grain resources are approximately sufficient for two divisions for one year. The grain resources of the country exceed the local means for grinding the same ; special arrangements would, therefore, be necessary. There are two classes of cattle, the naizari that graze in the naizar, and the dehati that live in the villages. It is said that about 1,500 are slaughtered or exported annually to Meshed. Shiraz, Isfahan, and Nishapur. In normal years the total num bers in Sist.an probably reach 70,000: these include some 34,001 slaughter cattle, at 120 to 200 brans each. The sheep are nearly all black, and of the fat-tailed variety. In normal years, the total number of sheep and goats is placed at 172,000, the sheep numbering about 130,000 including 22,000 available for sale, and the goats 42,000 with 7,000 avail able for sale,Prices are—for sheep, 14 to 20 lerans. In milk, 16 to 25 hrdns. For goats, 8 to 14 hrans. In milk, 15 to 20 lerans. Towards the end of January, if enough rain has fallen to ensure water on the road and good grazing in the spring, the majority of sheep and goats are moved to the hills, ff rain is short, many flocks move from the cultivated tract to the Bumnistan, on the shores of the Him In, where thev thrive on the bun tin grass. In ordinary years, by the end of February the flocks have left the cultivated tract, and, at the end of March, the last of those going have reached the hills. If the grazing in the hills is good, some flocks remain there till the autumn, or even the next year, but in normal years all return to gistan. v averages nearly 1 maund for 6 annas, and Bhusa. about 100,000 maunds are available annually. Traders in Sis- tan state that they could supply 5,000 maunds each without difficulty. The price of firewood in 1910 was 110 lbs. for 4 annas. virewood. From the Mian Kangl district a sufficient quantity is avail able for an army corps. For Nasratabad it is obtained by dig- gmg up roots of tamarisk scrub.

The Army, Unstable finances and shortcomings in the national character render any organization of the Army, in the European sense of the term, a difficult matter. The Persian Government has repeatedly had recourse to European military instructors. At the beginning of the 17th century, English officers were taken into service of the Shah as instructors, but their work had no permanent result. Sin e then, French, English, Italian, and Austrian officers have in turn attempted the task with similar ill-success. That none of these military missions achieved any measure of lasting success, may be attributed to the mutual jealousies of the European powers, the want of suitable material, and to financial difficulties,' Most of these foreign officers held but a poor opinion of the military qualities of the Persian people. The officers were said to be wanting in the moral qualities required for command; the rank and file, though tractable, and not unintelligent, are without natural respect for their officers, and therefore difficult to discipline. Some British officers were of opinion that the enlistment of irregular tribal corps gave the best promise of suc cess, in a people consisting largely of a loose conglomeration of formerly nomadic tribes. In 1878, the Persian Government accepted the services of Russian officers, as instructors for the Cossack Brigade, accom panied by a gift of 1,000 rifles, and 2 light field batteries for its preliminary armament. This Brigade has not only maintain ed, but improved its position, owing to the continual growth of Russia’s influence, and the conscientious work of the Russian instructors. Excellent material exists, especially among the Kurdish and Turkish tribes, mainly from Azarbaijan, and others scattered also over Khorasan and Ears, The Bakhtiaris could also General characteristics of the soldiers.212 furnish good men. These people are all strong, hardy, and fru gal, but without any military education and training. The Persian soldier is paid poorly, irregularly, or more often not at all, and is in consequence compelled to eke out his livelihood by causal labour. Men in tattered uniforms are to be seen in every town engaged in civil work. For this they have abundant leisure, as military training is practically non-existent. A mix ture of old uniform and cast off civilian clothing is usually worn. Soldiers are supposed to spend two years out of every three with the colours, and are permitted, when not under arms, to return home and pursue their ordinary vocations. In practice many regiments are not embodied at all, and, in those embodied, service is frequently evaded by bribery, so the numbers under arms are still further diminished. General characteristics of the officers. All the qualities, considered indispensable to their calling among the officers of a European Army, are wanting in most Persian officers. They are appointed and promoted by pat ronage, and by purchase, without regard to efficiency, and take little interest in the study of their profession. Sums varying between £200 and £1,000 are frequently paid to obtain high commands. Recruiting. Recruits for the regular infantry and artillery are obtain ed by the bounitcheh system, under which each district, village or tribe furnishes its quota of recruits, in proportion to the amount contributed by it to the revenue. This system leads to much irregularity, and is far from satisfactory, the results being that the ranks arc filled with weaklings and ‘ village failures ”, and not with the best men. Azarbaijan provides the majority of recruits for the infantry and artillery. Exemptions from service. The following classes are exempted from service Christians, Jews, Parsis, cultivators of crown lands, inhabi tants of villages freed from the land tax, Saiyifc} and Mull as. The districts of Kirman and Yazd arc seldom drawn upon on account of the poor physique of the inhabitants. Term of service. in the artillery and infantry, service is practically for life. Strength. According to the official lists, the Persian army consists of 150,000 men, with a reserve of 50,000. No indication is givenas to how these figures are arrived at, but as they bear little relation to the actual fighting strength of the country, this does not seem to be a matter of great importance. The forces are best divided into— (1) The Cossack Brigade. (2) Regular infantry. (3) Tribal levies, chiefly cavalry. (4) Artillery, or rather men enlisted as gunners. of Persia ^ 6 j, 0 ^ Sac ^ includes the only regular cavalry Cossack ersia.

Total 1,149 The composition being— 4 cavalry regiments. 2 batteries of horse artillery. 3 companies of infantry, each 100 strong. Each cavalry regiment then consisted of two squadrons of about 60 rank and file each. The cavalry were armed with the Berdan rifle, a sword and a dagger. Each battery had an establishment of 100 mounted and 32 dismounted gunners, 168 horses, and 26 wagons and spare horses. The armament of each battery was four 8-7 c.m. Krupp guns, with a full proportion of wagons. In addition to the men shown in the above return, about 400 more were then employed as guards for Persian officials, foreign legations, on detachment at various places, and at posts on the quarantine cordon in Khorasan. Finally, in 1909, the Brigade was reported to consist of 4 regiments of cavalry, each of two squadrons, total strength 1,350 ; 1 battalion of infantry of 4 companies, each 100 strong, but the strength fluctuating, as men of the cavalry, whose horses were unfit for service, were temporarily enrolled in its ranks ; 2 horse batteries, each of 4 six-horsed guns and 80 men, with 6 ammunition wagons (then without horses).The brigade band consisted of a band-master and 60 men. During January 1910, in the National Assembly, the under-secretary for war stated that the Russian colonei ashed for an increase of 400 men, and three additional Russian officers because the Brigade had to provide so many detachments ; but, this was not sanctioned. The National Assembly, sometime previous to this, complained that the men of the Brigade were largely employed to collect information for Russia The Brigade is commanded by a Russian officer of the Russian General Staff, who is nominally under the Persian Minister of War, and draws pay from the Minister of Finance, but is in direct communication with the Russian Government and Russian Embassy. The instructional staff consists of 4 officers (2 cavalry, 1 infantry and 1 artillery), 5 non-commissioned officers and 1 medical, and 1 veterinary officer. These officers are attached for a period of three years. The interior economy resembles that of one of the Cau- Interior casian Cossack Regiments. The words of command are given in economy. Persian, but many Persian officers and non-commissioned officers can speak Russian. The Brigade recently received 400 Russian repeating Armament, rifles (3 line, pattern 1904), but still use their single loading Berdans. The magazines, in 1909, contained 20,000 rounds of Berdan ball ammunition, which can now only be obtained in Belgium. A total stock of 4,000 common shell, shrapnel, and case shot, is kept for the Krupp guns of the batteries, and additional supplies could be drawn from Russia in case of need. Since the summer of 1908, the infantry battalion has been equipped with four 6-6 millimetre machine guns of the maxim- Spandau system. Ten thousand cartridges per gun are maintained. About the same time the Brigade was allotted eight 7-5 centimetre automatic-recoil field guns of the system Schneider- Creusot. Each of these guns has a supply of 75 rounds of shrap nel, 25 common shell and 8 case shot. Recruiting is voluntary and carried out under the super- Keoruiting. vision of the commandant. Men are not enlisted for any specialUniform. Relation between Russian and Persian officers. 216 term of service. The age is from 18 to 40, and every man has to be passed fit by the medical officer of the Brigade. After 15 years’ service, a man can claim a pension for life at the rate of half bis pay ; after 30 years, a pension equal to his full pay (the minimum being 3 tumdns monthly, or about 10s. lid). Should a man, as the result of service, be incapacitated from earning his living, he receives a gratuity on discharge. The pay amounts to 3 tdmjns a month, and rises in the case of non-commissioned officers to 4-7 tiimdna (17s. Id). On field service these rates are doubled or trebled.. In contrast with the rest of the army, the Brigade is paid regularly. The classes which supply the recruits are:— (1) Persians, of whom there are only 10 %, a striking testimony of the non-military spirit of the race. (2) Nomads, Turks and Kurds, from Azarbaijan and Kazvln. Of these there are 15 %. (3) The remaining 75 % are from nomad tribes in the vicinity of Tehran, Qum, and Kazvln, and parti cularly from the Baghdadi section of the Shah- savan tribes. Among these the native officers are men of influence in their tribe, and have their own following. Each man brings his horse on enlistment, and, during his service, replaces it when necessary. They are small but service able animals, though inferior to the Indian Cavalry remount. The artillery horses are government property, and considering the difficulty of getting draught animals, are of a useful stamp. The men undergo an annual training in musketry and artillery practice, similar to that prescribed for the Russian Army. They are good natural shots, and make very fair gunners. The uniform is nearly identical with that of the Cossacks of the Russian Army, consisting of a long-skirted brown coat and pantaloons tucked into high boots. The head-dress is the usual black lambs-wool kulloh, which has a high crown and no brim nor peak. The relations between Russian and senior Persian'officers appear to be friendly but not intimate. The gap between them is about the same as between British and Indian officers in the Indian Army, and rather wider than in the case of Imperial j jtit tops, atnaa unit off , jilyraiie 200 jaMrigsceis !is of emerge: lie Wgnarf fatal as tie i w, oMth nek; a large n : ustoffc Europe. : Menonfm ' ftHy rohcing ifortkofttere: . ffllsjat thecc .asy oa ia tie iota 4 miles n i»le ground t II Mns (£4 Jip-feep of tie sold iy tie ] 2 s® of Persian a Persian fs .^htiefega, te in Per | and fra;, 1 §(5 »iter Euro ^finakiadof ^ ar o stored i Wleoftah Popart of tiiservice troops, to which the Brigade corresponds more nearly, than to an unit of the regular Indian Army. There is no explana tion why some 200 Persian officers are necessary, unless it be that the Brigade is looked upon as a cadre capable of expansion in case of emergency; its organization generally favours this view. - ihe headquarters of the Brigade have always been at Head-quarters. Tehran; but, as the men are given two months’ furlough during the year, one-sixth of the force is permanently absent. Of the remainder, a large number are required for detachment duty, and most of the European Legations are furnished with Cossack guards. Men on furlough draw half-pay, and it is only by con siderably reducing the establishment, and allowing a large proportion of the remainder to go on furlough during the winter months, that the commandant is able to collect sufficient funds to carry on in the summer. At this time, the Brigade moves into huts 4 miles north of the city, and does a certain amount of parade ground training, but no field training. The sum of 230,000 tumdns (£41,783) is provided in the Persian budget for the up-keep of the Brigade. The pay and administration are controlled by the Kussian commandant. An elementary school is maintained for the instruction of Brigade the sons of Persian officers in the Brigade. The pupils are School, etc. taught to read and write Russian, and, in the higher classes, instruction is given in military subjects. In the lines are also a hospital of 30 beds, a veterinary hospital, farriers’ and carpenters’ shops, and a Persian bath. Though the Cossack Brigade is, except the reformed troops the only force in Persia that can lay any claim to discipline’ PractiaI use ' organization and training, it is not considered by any means fit to encounter European or Indian troops. Them L no kind of transport maintained, and grain and fodder for horses are stored in warehouses, for use in Tehran. Though hardly capable oHakiag the field, it is of great use in guarding and policing Tehran, and furnishes detachments when required to- any distant part of the country. Liakhoff arrived in Tehran, in September fodo, he found the brigade completely out of control, and the218 administration of its affairs in the hands of a “military council” of Persian officers. He gradually succeeded in abolishing this council, and weeded out Persian officers opposed to Russian influ ence. There was considerable difficulty, as, besides intrigues in the Brigade itself, the leading priests, several Ministers, and the National Assembly all made efforts to curtail his power. In December 1907, when the Shah had designs of using the Brigade to destroy the National Assembly, Colonel Liakhoff had to confess that his men could not be relied on for this purpose. His efforts, however, were so far successful that on the 23rd June 1908, when the Nationalists entered Tehran, the Brigade did not side with them, though a compromise was afterwards effected, and Liakhoff was for several months, under the existing martial law, militarygovernor of Tehran. At that time 1,100 men, out of a total of 1,500, remained with their Russian officers; the remainder quietly disappeared. The Brigade having been a force so entirely under Russian influence, it is only to be expected that the new Government will take all possible measures to prevent that influence re-asserting itself. Colonel Liakhoff’s connec tion with the tw r o coups d’lUtat, which aimed at the destruction of the constitution, his persistent efforts to make the Brigade a Russian force, and his employment of detachments of the force as intelligence agents for Russia all over the country, earned for him and Russia the deep hatred of a large number of Persians. In November 1909, Colonel Prince Yadbolski arrived in Teh- ran, and took over the command of the Persian Cossack Brigade. In 1907, the official returns showed 78 battalions of ordin ary Persian infantry. Of these only about 30 are as a rule em bodied, the remainder being merely liable for service when called upon. The actual strength of regiments serving varies from 200 to 600 : they are usually at their highest strength when newly called out, after which the numbers gradually diminish owing to desertions. The practical working of this system has, up to date, been somewhat as follows:—Orders are issued for the embodiment of, say, the Khasseh regiment to relieve the Iqbal regiment for duty at Kazvin. The officer commanding the regiment collects some 500 or 600 men by touring round all the villages responsible for his recruits, accompanied by several of his officers, and a representative of the pay department. Prior to his arrival, the local headmen make their selection of the men they can wparafe, S alien ire enM sfeandall I® pay is fort ‘fen, consists e fiat in the * a from tht | r ' jc : claim t, ^offtetown fteir nafc previo! ^knds ofbest spare, the poorest and weakest as a rule. From these the Colonel makes his selections, and in course of time arrives with them at the place ordered. Should an inspection of the regiment take place, and his regiment be under strength, he will prob ably borrow the necessary number of men from the relieved regi- ment until the inspection is over. The new arrivals then disperse about the town and neighbouring villages, where they earn their livelihood as best they can, leaving only sufficient men to supply the necessary guards; they pay their commanding officer a small sum per diem out of their earnings, and from the sum thus pro vided, those who remain on duty are occasionally recompensed. For the greater part of the year they are not required to appear on any parades. Should a parade be ordered, or a summer camp outside the city, the dispersed men are collected and local inen are enlisted temporarily to make good any shortage A nondescript uniform and a firearm being all that is necessary to make a Persian soldier, so long as the Gommandina Officer has these and a little money, he can always bring his battalion up to strength at short notice, more especially as, during train mg, some pay is forthcoming. To say, then, that the garrison of Kazvm, consists of 4 battalions, implies only that there are present in the town and neighbourhood some 2,000 to 3ffi00 men from the districts which supply those battalions th' 0 faTtbat b fb br ° UShfc t0 f th Ti lf necessar y ; but apart from , iact thafc ar e armed with an antiquated weapon they have no more claim to be called soldiers, than have any other in- habitants of the town. Their efficiency as fightino- men depends entirely on their natural aptitude, or any experience they may have acquired previous to enlistment. Their value as an instru ment in the hands of Government is dependent largely on the cause in which they are called out, and to what extent their sympathies are with the opposite party. The sole advantage of this system would appear to be its pen Arm 7 ’ a V t obviates to a g reat extent the necessity of paying the tm 7 ' Amon gits many disadvantages is the fact that if’ the ro ps are wanted for any purpose, they usually refuse to leave t n occupations, unless they receive at least a portffin of their Arrears of pay, and this the Government iLeldomffin position to produce at once.

The Werndl is the regulation arm, and about 70,000 of these weapons were procured from time to time from Austria prior to 1900. Since then 10,000 more have been received, and during 1908 about 12,000 French Lebel magazine rifles (Pattern 86-93) as well. A special force of 400 men, raised by Muhammad , Ali Mlrza- immediately before his accession, was armed with rifles purchased in Russia. Bearing in mind, however, the continual peculation, by which officials connected with the arsenals compensate themselves for the non-receipt of their pay, it is doubtful whether all these rifles are still avail able. As no ammunition has been manufactured in Persia of recent years, and very little has been imported, the greater part of what now remains in Government possession must have so deteriorated as to Le almost useless. Of the 78 battalions, 25 are drawn from Azarbaijan, 9 from Mazardaran, 5 from ’Iraq, 5 from Hamadan, 4 from Kirmanshah, and 3each from Isfahan, Kirman and Kazvin. The remaining odd battalions are taken from various places in the northern half of Persia, none from the southern. In round numbers their strength may be taken as follows • Nominal .. .. • • 78,000 Actual .. .. • • • • 35,010 Underarms .. . •• 13,'00 It was decided to call regiments by their numbers, _ but this is not done. They are known by their old appellations, territorial or others, and divided into Azarbaijam and Iraqi regiments, according to the province from which they draw their pay. The regulation strength of a battalion is 800 to 1,000 men with 38 officers. There should be 10 companies, each with d officers, and divided into two sections; in reality there are generally about 4 companies of about 100 men e a cl1 - As rega mobility, each two or three men has a mule or donkey and on the march the regiment straggles along m twosand threes, driving along their animals loaded with tents, beddmg and their firearms.

For musketry training the expenditure of ball ammunition does not exceed 5 rounds per man per annum, and this usually only in Tehr :n. The Turk soldier never attains any proficiency as a shot, but the Kurd, Lur, Bakhtnii, etc., of the tribal Infantry acquire some skill, because, unlike the Turk, they have carried arms from their youth upwards. The soldier receives his rations and house allowances Pay always; not so his pay. The officer is hardly any better off ; he is generally from 6 months to a year in arrears, and, moreover, has to submit to outrageous deductions. When unemployed’ both are entitled only to half pay It may be noted that the character, loyalty, courage, and physique of the Turks are proverbial, and history has shown that he has in him the makings of a fine soldier. The Persian, as a soldier, is held of little account in his own country, and is only useful for policing the country, and serving in districts distasteful to the Turkish tribes. The “ reformed infantry” are discussed at the end of this chapter. The Cavalry of the Persian army is organised entirely on a Tribal tribal basis, the men serving under their own leaders and supplying T their own horses, arms and equipment. A few infantry detach ments are also found by the tribes, and it is, therefore, convenient to consider them all together. Both cavalry and infantry are divided into dastehs or detachments of varying strength, which with the exception of a small number employed as escorts to high officials at the larger towns, serve entirely in their own districts. The names of these detachments appear in the Sdlndmf h or official report, but this gives no indication of their nominal strength, which varies fom 50 to 2,000. These nominal strengths, however, represent only the number of men which the tribal chiefs are subsidised to maintain at the disposal of Government. Of these a part are employed permanently as Kara- suran, or police, for the protection of main routes ; but the majority are only called out when their services are required. Colonel Picot estimated the total nominal strengths in 1900 at 37,591, and they have probably remained much the same, but222 these figures bear little relation to the total force, which the tribes could, if they wished, collect in their own districts. The majority of the irregular cavalry are in the provinces of Azarbaijan and Khorasan. As to their value as fighting men opinions vary, but they are at least greatly- superior to the ordinary regular infantry. The frontier tribes of both provinces are accustomed to the use of arms from childhood, are usually fair shots at short ranges, and are capable of offering considerable resistance in their own country. Their tactics would be entirely those of guerillas and it is unlikely that they would ever stand up to well armed troops, but w'ould confine their operations to raiding and generally harassing communications, or attacking small detached parties. It is probable that an invading force, which had once established its superiority, would have little trouble in persuading them to come to terms. It is improbabl) that these tribes would, under any circumstances, consent to serve at a distance from their own country. They would certainly not do so in order to repel a foreign invader, though, in case of internal dissension, it is conceivable that the prospect of plunder might induce them to follow a leader in whom they had confidence. Speaking generally, the tribesmen are armed with breech-loading rifles, those in the north having been chiefly procured from Russia, while the southern tribes are supplied vii the Persian Gulf. These latter are chiefly armed with trade Martinis, much worn and in bad repair, and owing to the embargo now placed on the import of rifles, they find some difficulty in replacing them. The supply of ammunition is also very precarious and they are largely dependent on cases reloaded by themselves with powder of local make. The officers serve without pay as a rule, but receive free rations and forage when on service; they are appointed from the tribal chiefs and headmen. The non-commissioned officers and men are nominally paid at the rate of 20 to 24 tumdns a year (£3-12-8 to £4-7-2) with free forage, but the payment varies according to the locality. The amount each man receives also va ries, as pay passes through the hands of the officers, the distribu tion being left by Government to the chief of the tribe. Their horses are Arab, Persian and Turkoman, averaging 14 hands, hardy and easily trained. The breed in the south-western prov inces is reported to be deteriorating.

The 3rd division consisted of tw batteries of mountain artillery, each with four Euchatius guns, vith mules supplied from the government breeding establish ments of Mazandaran or hired as required. The 4th division comprised two batteries of machine guns, one with four Nordenfelt guns, the other with six Mauser Maxims, of the same pattern as those in use in the German army, imported in 1903, with 100,000 rounds of ammunition. A certain number of men from the Zambur^kchls, a camel corps which is a relic of the old Persian mountain artillery, are trained in the use of camel guns. This corps consisted of 40 or 50 camels, with obsolete swivel-guns of no value except for ceremonial purposes. The machine gun division is in charge of Herr Hase, an ex-non-commissioned officer of the German Army, who himself keeps the guns clean and in order. The Salnameh shows in reserve— 1 battery of 4J pounders of Persian make. 1 battery of 7 c. m. mountain guns. The total effective strength was reported to bo about 5,800 men, nearly all drawn from Azarbaijan. The artillery branch is more popular than the infantry. The latest reports state the artillery to be distributed in 15 commands, each consisting of 4 to 6 guns with a personnel of nominally 250 men. In more than half of these commands, however, the men do not exist, while in the remainder they are practically untrain ed. The batteries are generally short of horses; but during the summer months in Tehran, a few batteries are horsed annually for a month or two. There are no ammunition wagons, and ammunition is carried on camels or mules. Hie guns date for the most part from the period of the Guns Austrian Mission of 1879, and are 7, 8 and 9 c. m., Euchatius pattern, with the exception of 10 Krupp guns, (8 of which are with the Cossack Brigade) and the recently imported Creusot guns. There are said to exist at present fifty-one 8 and 9 c. m. field guns (pattern 75), thirty-two 7 c. m. mountain guns (pattern 75), and some 500 to 600 guns of obsolete patterns, mostly of native manufacture. There are no guns of laree calibre. 6224 Organisation. Recruitment. Horses. At the end of 1908, Creusot supplied the Persian Goverh- ment with 32 modern 7-5. c.m. automatic-recoil guns. Of these only 16 have been mounted, and 8 have been taken over by the Cossack Brigade as above mentioned, and 8 more are now with the “ reformed” batteries. Artillery experts consider these guns to be of defective construction. More recently, sixteen 7'5 centimetre Schncider-Creusot mountain guns, without automatic recoil equipment, have been imported. For each of the 32 modern field guns and 16 mountain guns, there is a supply of 75 shrapnel, 25 common shell, and 8 case shot, of which the Cossack Brigade has appropriated the greater part. Nearly all the modern guns are kept at Tehran, but a few of the Euchatius guns were sent to Tabriz , Khci and Kirmanshah. There are tw o 9 c. m. Krupp guns at Isfahan. The old obsolete guns are stored in the Arse nal at Tehran, or distributed throughout the provinces. The artillery is divided into taifas or tribes, which are generally known by the names of their localities. There are 27 of these taifas, of which 13 belong to Azarbaxjan, and the remainder are distributed over other provinces, practically all in the north and west. It is probable that the Turkish tribes furnish at least three quarters of the total strength of the various corps, the remaining quarter being formed by other nomad tribes. The total nominal strength is shown at about 11,000, with an effective or actual strength of some 5,800. Of these probably less than 1,000 would be under arms. The. system of recruiting is the bounitcheh, previously described, but with the artillery it is perhaps tribal rather than local. There is little difficulty in procuring recruits for artillery. Service is nominally for life, but in practice men are always able by payment to arrange for substitutes. Horses are drawn from the Shah’s breeding establishment of Sultanleh in Khamseh, Ujan, and Tehran, but it is probable that not nearly 1,000 could be accounted for at any given mo ment. On emergency horses are impressed or hired. The ani mals available are small and compact, of the Karadagh or Shir az types. The equipment is fairly serviceable, and the harness good, though rough. As a rule the mountain guns are not carried on the backs of mules, but drawn, the shafts being attached to the trail.

Naturally much friction arises, though the system is less chaotic than might be inferred. The system of instruction is based on the Austrian, and dates Training from the time oi the first mission. Shell practice of late years has not been indulged in, except on a few occasions in the pres ence of the Shah, when special officers took charge of the &lt;m ns though ammunition was always very sparingly issued, the sup' ply for the Euchatius guns must now be very small, and also have deteriorated.

They are purely local, their numbers are insignificant and dwindling. The senior military officer, excutive and sometimes admin istrative, is known as the— Vazir-i-Jang, Minister of War; Sipah Salar ] \ Commander-in-Chief; Sipah Salar-i-Azam. J as the case may be. The latter is the higher title. . His powers are variable and undefined. They depend al most entirely on the social rank and character of the individual, and are limited by neither rule nor regulation. Hence, both at Tehran and in the provinces, the military authority is often entirely subordinate to the civil. There is no regular staff service, but attached to the com mander-in-chief, provincial governors and such officials, are officers known as ajud&amp;n, or aides-de-camp. They are, as a rule, without any military training, other than that of the ordinary regimental officer, and retain their appointments just as long as their masters. The nearest approach to a staff officer is to be found in the ajuddn bdshl, or chief of the staff, who assembles the troops for review and arranges military durbars in the Pal ace ; otherwise his duties are nil These appointments are ob tained by favouritism tempered by purchase. Pay department. The pay department is under the control of a civilian offi cial whose title is the Vazir-i-Lashkar. He is assisted by a numerous staff of accountants, who prepare the annual budget, and make a preliminary examination of the accounts submitted by disbursing officers and departments. * The army estimate, for the coming year, is prepared at Nau- ruz (21st March), and forwarded to the Minister of Finance for check and audit. Estimates, when passed, are included in the budgets of provincial governors or heads of departments, to serve as a basis for the military disbursements of the year. Departments the Army. The War Department. Staff Service.227 i Service in the pay department is much sought after, and large sums of money are paid for appointments in it. The “ordnance’’ department is known as the Vazlrat-i-Kar Arsenals and EMineh and is administered by a civilian official of the rank of m aterial« minister. He is responsible for the purchase and supply of arms and ammunition, military equipment and miscellaneous stores, such as musical instruments, etc. Arsenals exist at Tehran, Tab riz, Kbol, Urumieh, Isfahan, Shiraz, Meshed, Astarabad, Kirm- anshah, Khurramabad, Shiishtar, Kirman, Bushire and Rasht. Formerly guns and rifles were chiefly procured from Austria but since 1907, when a consignment of 10,000 old VVerndl rifles with 1,000,000 rounds of ammunition, sixteen 7 c. m. mountain guns wi th carriages and 2,976 rounds, and'cases of saddlery and sun dries, were received, no orders have been placed there. The four maxim-rSTordenfelts, mentioned before, are English pat tern, but were bought from the Austrians, and were received in 189.U; they have both wheel and tripod mountings, and shields. The six mauser-maxims received in 1903 are German, with them came also one German naval pattern maxim ; these have also both tripod and wheel mountings. Eor’pack equipment, there are six sets of German pattern and six of Russian. With the wheeled mounting a second limber is attached, and the whole drawn by four horses, a method discarded by the German army as unsuited to rough ground. In this way 5,000 rounds are carried with each gun. Of the 100,000 rounds purchased with the guns, 20,000 were stolen by employ 's, who had received no pay. In 1907 12,000 Rebel rifles from France, with 3,400,920 rounds of ammunition, arrived atEnzali. Between 1906-08, 48 guns Q.F.75 m.m. Schneider, of French make, were supplied. Of these 44 with 4,000 shell were handed over to Colonel Liakhoff after the coup d Hat of June 23rd, 1908. The arms received from these trench firms had not been paid for at the end of 1910. Early in 1910, the Persian Government approached the Imperial Bank oi Persia, respecting a supply of arms and ammunition. The proposition was that the Bank should obtain expert advice and purchase for them 50,000 rifles, and 10,000 mauser revolvers of the most up-to-date pattern, with 300 rounds of ammunition or each weapon, the Government paying 2 per cent, commission and out-of-pocket expenses. The Russian Government then stated that a similar request had been made to them in Novem-Oar‘ridge factory. Clothing department. Supply and transport department. Medical department. ber 1009 and that they were able to supply the rifles and ammuhition, but not the revolvers. At present no settlement has been arrived at for either party to supply anything. • • ’ ^ The above instances are instructive as showing the methods of the arsenal department for obtaining war material, they also prove that the Persian Government prefer to trust Europeans to obtain the needful supplies, rather than one of their own countrymen, who would seek only his own profit by providing arms of an inferior stamp. In 1902, the cartridge factory at Tehran was reorganized by an ex-non-commissioned officer of the Austrian Army. New machinery was ordered from Austria, but as the Werndl rifles have now been replaced by the French Lebel, the factory will have to be reorgani ed again before it is of any use. The central office of the clothing department is at Tehran, whence issues are made to the governors of provinces, all re ceipts, etc., being checked by the paymaster-general. Supply and transport departments do not exist in the Per- sian army. When on the march the troops are neither paid nor fed adequately by the Government, and have recourse to plunder, so that a Persian column causes greater terror to the people of its own country than to the enemy. The baggage of each two or three men is carried on a donkey or mule, which is private property. There is no properly organised medical department in the Persian Army and medical officers and military hospitals do not exist outside the Cossack Brigade, and latterly the reformed troops. Persia is a signatory to the Geneva Convention, and has adopted the badge of a white arm-band with a red lion instead of the red cross. The bad climate and total want of sanitation in Persia are matters to be reckoned with. Medical men are supposed to be attached to infantry and artillery at Government expense. In practice only regiments that can afford to pay for them have doctors. There are no hos pitals, but medicines are di pensed from a shed near the bar racks Out of the amount allowed annually for medicines and necessaries, it is said that not one-tenth is spent legitimately. Numbers of doctors, surgeons and apothecaries are borne o the rolls, and draw pay or pension from the department.229 The Dar-ul-Fanun at Tehran dates from about 1850, and Military has been under the regime of the first Austrian, the Italian, the 3chools ‘ Trench, and second Austrian missions, and in 1882 was re-organiz ed on a Prussian model by Prussian officers. The students consist of Persians and Turks, who are entered at the age of 14 after passing a simple elementary exam ination. Military classes are taught infantry and artillery sub jects, but there are also civilian classes for the study of geology, medicine, mathematics and foreign languages. A complete course theoretically covers a period of 8 years. The students show intelligence, but have no incentive, owing to the absence of any guarantee of future employment, and numbers of the military students fail to obtain commissions after passing through the army course. The reformation of this college is included in the 1910 scheme. The Nasiri College has practically ceased to exist. The school of the Cossack Brigade has already been described. The official and distinctive colours of the various branches aiform. of the Persian army are as follows:— Infantry red. Artillery blue. Cavalry green. The kullah or cap is made of imitation black astrakhan or infantry, inferior black cloth, bearing in front the badge of the lion and sun in metal and a red cockade, a red band encircles the kullah. The tunic is blue or black with red facings and epaulettes. It wears threadbare in a month. Pantaloons are blue with red stripes. In winter ankle-boots are worn, in summer often a native shoe called giveh, which has no laces, the uppers of knitted cotton, and soles of rags beaten together with glue and stitched. The great coat is of brown felt with a hood of the same material. It is heavy and clumsy but warm, and fairly water proof when new. It is only issued on rare occasions. Equipment consists of a belt of varnished black leather with a pouch for 30 ball cartridges. A tin water bottle covered with felt, and a haversack. The last two are only issued on special occasions. The kullah of the artillery is similar to the infantry, but has Artillery, a blue cockade and band; the tunic is also similar, but has blueCavalry. Issues of uniforms. Uniform of officers. facings, etc. The pantaloons are generally tucked into long Russian boots of black leather. Great coat, water bottle and haversack are as for infantry. A black belt and sword are carried by every artillery man. The kullah of the cavalry is known as the Tabriz!, is usually higher in the crown, and the lion and sun badge is encircled by a wreath. It varies in colour and material, according to . the taste of the commanding officer or custom of the tribe. The tunic is generally of the old Persian pattern, pleated at the waist and with a skirt reaching to the knees. The facings, etc., are green and the buttons of white metal stamped with the lion and sun. The boots are of black leather and of Russian pattern. Gaiters are sometimes worn. Irregular Cavalry dress as they like. Theoretically, every infantry and artillery soldier, under arms, should receive annually one suit of thick winter, and two suits of light summer, uniform. On an average, however, he receives one suit of summer clothing every year or every two years. This, combined with the poor material of which uni forms are made, accounts for the ragged appearance of the average Persian soldier. New uniforms are issued for big reviews, but after the parade these are immediately repacked and returned to store. The regulation dress of the officers of the Persian army is of the Austrian pattern, slightly modified by Persian taste and prejudice. The different ranks are marked by the variety in the make and material of the badge of the lion and the sun worn on the kullah, by the number of stars worn on the collar of the tunic, by the material of the sash, and other minor differences. The badge of the lion and the sun is composed of four parts, the sabre, the sun with face, the lion and the base, these parts are respectively white or yellow according to the rank of the wearer. Officers wear a kullah of real astrakhan or fine black cloth, a tunic of dark blue cloth, with a single line of buttons for junior grades, and double line for sartip and senior1 m 231 officers, pantaloons of dark blue cloth, either tucked into long boots or worn loose with the walking boot, without stripes for juniors, but with double gold stripes for seniors; a great-coat of Austrian pattern of dark blue cloth, with double row of buttons and collar, with red facings for infantry, and blue for artillery. The sword and slings, worn under the tunic, are of Austrian pattern, the sword knot is of gold embroidery. The sash for sarhang and junior grades is in yellow and black silk, for senior officers in gold and black embroidery It is worn round the waist and knotted on the left side except by aides-de-camp of the Shah, who wear it over th* sWi.w As a rule the Persian officer is careful of his dress and presents a respectable appearance in uniform, whether on or oft parade. The chief military ranks are as follows Both these officers wear on the k ullahn badge of two lions- rampart facing inward, surmounted by the Imperial crown, ana have a specially embroidered collar.

This varies between about £110 a year for a sartlp and 35s. a year for a sarbdz. Soldiers also receive grants of money called khdnehwdreh, which are credited annually to them or their families by their villages. The amount varies very considerably in the different districts and is fixed independently of Government. In some parts of the country, recruits receive on enrolment a bounty called pidardneh or paternal allowance. The difference between Jchdnewdreh and pidardneh is that the former is given every year, the latter once only. When embodied for service, officers, cossacks, and irregu lar cavalry receive alikh, or horse allowance, the amount de pending on the current value of grain and fodder. To obtain a correct return of the distribution of the Per- Distribution, sian army is a difficult matter, especially as the official returns show a large excess over the actuals and recent returns of separate places, which may to some extent be relied on and are for different years. For 1903 a complete return is available, showing the numbers actually under arms approximately as:— i Iniantry. Cavalry. Artillery.

I “ June 1907, the approximate strength of the Tehran gar- rison, in addition to the Cossack Brigade, was nine battalions of infantry, including the palace guards, with a total strength of some 5,600; four regiments of cavalry numbering altogether about 1,170, and slightly better trained, on the lines of the Cossack Brigade, than the cavalry in the provinces. One regiment was then under the command of a Russian ; of artiflery some 900 men were nominally present. Latterly the scheme of reform for the Persian army has been started by reorganising the troops of the Tehran garrison. This matter will be fully dealt with later. At the end of 1910, there were about 1,000 Bakhtiaris in Teh ran, and it was decided to retain a force of 900 of them there in Government service. They will remain under command of their Chiefs, but will draw pay from the Government. In 1907, there were six infantry battalions in Khorasan ; of these two were stationed at Meshed, or at least their head quarters were there. The total strength of infantry was offi cially shown as 4,400. Of irregular cavalry, 28 detachments or dastehs are shown (the official lists show 55) varying in strength from 50 to 1,000 actually present. The total number present is given at 8,980 with 17,750 in reserve ; the official strength of 26,730 is thus obtained. Of these dastehs the most important are the Shadillu and Timuri, who could each pro duce some 3,000 fighting men, of whom T,000 are always pre sent and who, moreover, are of a good fighting stamp. The importance and efficiency of the Kuchanl dasteh has already been pointed out. The tribes of this province are registered to supply, in time of war, o2,000 savdrs ; but as the cavalry are mainly drawn from them, it is not clear how levies could be drawn in addition, and so these can only be considered as the number of mounted men that could be produced by the tribes, in case of a levy en masse. The artillery in Khorasan is shown as 90 gunners and 60 guns at Meshed, and 50 gunners and 30 guns in STstan. Among these guns are included all manner of old, corroded, useless235 guns without carriages, or with the carriages all in piece!. There are probably about a dozen effective field gun 3 in the whole of Khorasan; these are rilled muscle loaders, about Shpouuders. Their ammunition, equipment, harness, etc , is all of the most primitive type, and no horses are kept • (for in nentlv t0 ^ MeShed ^ Uns ;lre, P^ma- nently at Radkan for the grazing). There are also about 4 brass mountain guns, of very small size, about 4-poimd-rs probably, as the gun and carriage can be put on one horse Ihe latter seem much newer than the field guns. In Turbat-i-Haidarl are the head-quarters of the Kerai regiment. Here ^ a,lso are kept a breech-loading rifle and 20 rounds of ammunition for each man of the regiment, which numbers nominally 35 officers, and about 1,000 non-commis- sioned officers and men.

Sistan. Enzali and Rasht. Azarbaijan. In August 1909 the strength of the Kalnat garrison was:— One regiment of infantry, nominally 500 strong, armed with muzzle-loading guns of local manufacture. Savdrs, 277, their weapons being 120 breech-loaders (mostly snider and Martini-Henry carbines), of which 40 are the property of their Chief, the Shaukat-ul-Mulk. The remainder of the men carry locally made muzzle-loading guns. Artillery, 17 men, with 2 breech-loading mountain guns, made in Tehran after an Austrian model, 4 muzzle-loading rifled guns, and 1 muzzle-loading smooth bore gun. All these guns are mounted on carriages. The ammuni tion available then was about 150 camel-loads of powder, shot and shell (loaded and empty). The stock is a fairly large one, was imported from Tehran, and is stored in the citadel. In August 1909 the garrison in Sistan was— Infantry, 455 officers and men. Savars, 368. Jambazes, 69. Artillery, 33 gunners, with 2 B.-L. guns and 6 M.-L. ; of the above M.-L. guns, 3 are serviceable and the remaining 3 useless. The infantry for Sistan are usually furnished either by the Kain or by the Karai regiment, 'and are reported to possess 400 B.-L. rifles, and 20,000 cartridges, with 70,000 more in reserve. Weak detachments of infantry are stationed at Enzah and Rasht; also 12 gunners at each place There are all told at the two places, 12 muzzle-loading guns. In the arsenal at Rasht there are many boxes of ammunition for these guns, but never having been opened, they are by now probably useless. In this neighbourhood the inhabitants of the highlands of Shaft are noted shots, and it has been suggested that 3 excel lent regiments of 800 men each might easily be levied there. Klish would also provide good material for soldiers. According to the official returns, Azarbaijan has a very large part of the Persian army apportioned to it; but, as a mat. ter of fact, there are usually only 4, or at the most 5, battalio ns fiiirr unite arms Hat Ihestrengi jd 1 few 1,8, ai .•jaiilKbi, and i ligm and 1M.

Of these, 3 are usually stationed at Tabriz., The strength of the battalions is from 500 to 600 men. The artillery are not horsed, and horses are hired in case of need. A few 7, 8, and 9 c. m. Euchatius guns were sent to Tabriz and Kh5i, and at the former place were also 2 convert ed B.-L. guns and 1 M. L. English gun, but there is no informa tion to show what has become of these, or of several thousand Werndl and Chassepot rifles and cartridges, since the recent siege. Presumably a certain number of the rifles are still in the hands of the infantry, while the irregular cavalry no doubt seized the opportunity of securing a good many. The same may be said of Kh'ri, where there were 6 Euchatius guns 2,500 rifles, a quantity of rifle and gun ammunition, tents* stores, etc., in a good and well-kept arsenal, under charge of 30 gunners and a guard of 150 infantry. The irregular cavalry are furnished chiefly by the Kurds, Shahsavans, Karadaghls, and people of Maku. The Kurds are very disunited, and not likely to act under anybody’s orders. At the time of the national movement the Shahsavans gave much trouble about Ardabil, and only retired on the advance of the Russians. The Karadaghrs mostly obey only their own chief, while the people of Maku have, for the present, nationalistic tendencies. Generally speaking, all would do anything for pay and plunder, and have no principles whatever. Their numbers are quite vague. The KaradaghTs might possibly muster 10,000 horsemen, the Shahsavans 15,000, Makii 10,000, and the Kurds (in Azarblijan) 15,000 The Hamadan troops are supposed to consist of 6 infan try regiments, of whom the two Karaguzlu regiments, with a IIamadaa ' nominal strength of 1,000 each, should be good. Scarcely any of these troops are under arms as a rule. A small detachment of artillerymen also is located here. At Kirmanshah, there should be 500 infantry garrisoning Ki rm anshah the arsenal, which contains 500 Werndl rifles, two 7 c. m. and two 9 c. m. Euchatius guns. The fighting strength of the Kur dish tribes in the neighbourhood is estimated at about 7,000. Four cavalry detachments, totalling 500 men, are supposed to be always in readiness near the frontier. Burujird has a regiment of infantry nominally 1,000 strong, B actually barely 200; there are also a few gunners with 6 brass UrU '238 P usht-i Kuh. Isfahan. guns, and 700 muzzle-loading rifles. One of the Bakhtiar savdreh is nominally embodied here. The Vail has two regular infantry regiments, and a force of trained cavalry always at hand. The regiments are said to number about 1,000 men each, while the savlrs number about 500 men. The infantry are armed with a Martini pattern of rifle, and the savdrs with a pattern, probably Russian, of small bore rifle, of which the Yali has 500. The tribesmen generally own Martinis imported via the Gulf, or through Turkish terri tory. The Vali says he possesses some Lee-Metford service ri fles, and understands the working of them. Every tribes man carries a rifle and a large amount of ammunition. Savdrs carry up to 250 cartridges on their saddles, with perhaps another 150 in belts. Footmen generally carry two waist-belts, and another cross-belt, all full of cartridges. These cartridges are re-filled in the country, and, on the whole, the re-filling is well done. lesralryforw J less {Ian 5,1 dei, roue old, s slffwld be mom Ifid {lore is i if of {Omen at 'Silo tie Governor, ata firing salute limlry, iterate appr&lt; 35 lie).

Of these one, the 14 Jellalieh ”, with a nominal strength of 1,000 and actual of under 200, was employed on guard duties. The other two relieved each other in garrisoning Shiraz, the men of the one off duty remaining at their villages. As regards armament, there were said to be 6,000 rifles (Werndl), many of which were out of repair, with four small rooms full of ammunition—probably the residue of a supply manufactured locally some years ago under the orders of the Zil-us-Sultan. There were 12 mountain guns, of which 7 were serviceable; one an old English muzzle-loader, the others breech-loaders (Euchatius). There were no horses for the guns, only 16 artil lerymen and scarcely any ammunition. ^ Birckl^ ’id ialf T UI .j lost, ‘^ream, “condition, j inorm country it ^s^Noyenj * as 4 or,This “ Moveable Column ” was Cquipped with tents, so as to be able to move to any place, where its services might be required; and was made up as follows .

This column found great difficulty in collecting supplies at the various stages, and had to move in four detachments. It arrived in Shiraz in the beginning of 1911, and the strengths of the units have been depleted by numerous deser tions. Artillery at Bushire consists of 36 gunners with 4 small B.- L. guns, 14 M.-L. guns of obsolete pattern, (some unmounted) and 4 B.-L. guns,mounted on carriages, and commanding the inner harbour. (See Defences Bushire, Chapter VIII.) There is a certain amounthf ammunition for these, including 200 shells for the B.-L. guns. There are 17 semi-irregular savdrs. The infantry consists of a detachment of about 280, or at most 300, men from a battalion at Shiraz, and is armed with the Werndl rifle, 310 of which are in use and 560 in store. There were also 280 Werndl rifles in the Customs, with 17,000 cartridg es, In addition there were 2,000 rounds in issue and 13,000 in store. * In June 1911, men of this regiment attempted to take bast in the British consulate, owing to non-receipt of pay. A fracas ensued, and the Persian soldiers were driven hack by the Indian soldiers of the consular guard. As a consequence, the Jellalieh regiment was disbanded.Lingeh. Bandar 'Abbas. L»r.

In Bampur there are 100 infantry, at Fehruj at least 100 more, and about 200 are generally engaged under the Persian g ener ^ m extracting revenue from defaulting sardars and tribes. These tooop? though possessing enough of the rudiment, of dr,, cinline to overcome small communities of Baluchis who are too disorganized to unite, would be quite helpless m the face of a resolute enemy, such as the Afghan aim smugglers. At Lingeh and Bandar ’Abbas there are very small infantry detachments, and one or two gunners to fire salutes. The Khan of Lar has 200 riflemen, maintained quite independently of the Persian Government. He would probably use Ms troops against an invader, though he has no liking for the Persian Government. The majority of the inhabitants of Sis district are armed with Martinis, a few have German Man sera. In 1910 the armed men in Makran were estimated at 1,090. These were the immediate followers of 15 leading chiefs, of whom the most important are Saiyid ^Kha n of Geh anaQasm oand of whom 8 chiefs are the nominal feudatories , Islam Kh m q ana,oiwno Dizak, each with some 200 followers.

This at the present day is no longer the cas ; eeven if the tribesmen were induced to support the i'er- sian Government, a further difficulty would be to get them to act in unison with the regular troops and other tribes, and also to fight outside their own districts. Early in 1905, the Sh'.h redistributed the command of his regular troops in the provinces among tsn sirdars, the strength of the various commands totalling 66,903. The Tehran garri son, including artillery, some 10,000 men, was placed under another sarddr, and 60,000 troops, chiefly in the provinces east of Tehran were retained under the personal supervision of the Grand Vazir. The grand total of these troops was (on paper) 136,903 men. In 1910, a much more important reorganisation was started. In April of that year, Sardar As’ad, the Bakhtiari, was appoint ed minister of war, vice the Sipahdar, and held this office for a short time. He announced his intention of reorganizing the Persian army, in the same way that he had organi sed the gendarmerie, when Minister of the Interior. He brought with him his Under Secretary in the Ministry of the Interior, Qavvam-us-Sultaneh, reputed to be a capable organizer. The scheme included the appointment of Inspector-Gene rals for infantry, artillery and cavalry, and the starting of a school for the education of officers. The present system of enlistment, by which each district is called on to fur nish its quota of men, is retained, but voluntary enlist ment is to be permitted as well. The reorganization was to commence with the formation at Tehran of a force of 6,000 men, to include all arms axrd transport. Sardar As’ad’s successor as minister of war carried on the project. The scheme was started about June 1910, and a report on the reformed troops, three months later, states that the barracks and hospital were clean and tidy, the men marched well, and performed creditably the manual exercise, gymnastics and escalading drill. It con cludes with the remark that any one, who had seen only the old type of Persian soldier, would be astonished at the progress. In September 1910, reports on the progress of the reorgani zation scheme stated that it was intended eventually to have a force of 30,000 troops in the provinces, and one of 6,700 at Tehran. No attempt will be made yet to reorganize the provm-245 cial troops, but the reorganization of the Tehran force has already begun ; and the progress of the first regiment in less than three months, has been creditable. The force at Tehran will eventually consist of : Infantry. 4 regiments of 3 battalions of 4 companies of 100 men each. Total 4,800. Cavalry. 2 regiments of 4 squadrons of 110 all ranks. Total 880. Artillery. Organization not yet settled. Total 800. Engineers. Organization not yet settled. Total 220. The Tehran garrison under this new arrangement, in March 1911, consisted of :— Strength.

Each man receives 8 shdlls, about 2 pence a day, as pocket- money. The cavalry commandants were formerly officers in the Persian Cossack Brigade. The inspector-general of artillery and two of his assistants were trained at Constantinople. The budget is behm prepared strict economy is to be enforced, and the entire personnel of the ministry of war has been reduced to less than 100 nersons Colonel Kostersitz, a retired Austrian officer, is chief instructor m the military college at Tehran. He is acting as general ad viser to the Minister of war, and the latest Austrian drill books are being translated into Persian under his supervision. As it is considered impossible to get tribesmen to remain Tribal with the colours for 3 years, the period which the minister of horsemen * war considers necessary for their training, no decision has been arrived^ at as to the enlistment of tribal horsemen. The Bakhtiari forces, at Tehran and other towns, are only kept up to strength by being relieved every few months.

Naval Forces. The Russians do not allow any flag except their own to be Caspian, flown on the Caspian^ On that sea, therefore, the Persian Gov ernment have no vessels, except that at Enzali there is a small yacht of 120 tons presented to the Shah by the Czar of Russia. On the Persian Gulf, since 1885, has been stationed the Persian Gulf. “ Persepolis,” a screw gun boat of 600 tons and 450 h. p. armed with four 7 - 5 c. m. Krupp guns. This vessel is quite worn out and useless. She is generally unseaworthy, but, after being patched up, can undertake a short voyage in calm weather, at a speed not exceeding six knots. In 1903 the “ Muzaffari ”, a yacht armed with two Q. P. 1-pr. Hotchkiss guns, w r as purchased from the Belgians. She is commanded by a Belgian. Since 1907 the Persian Government have been anxious to sell off the “ Persepolis ” and “ Muzaffari ” and twm customs launches, and buy two light draught vessels capable of carrying troops and a few guns. Up to date the necessary funds have not been forthcoming to carry out this plan. Five launches of 75 h. p. were built at the Royal Indian Marine Dockyard, Bombay, and are used by the customs department on the Gulf. Each carries one French machine gun and cost I'd,000.CHAPTER VII. Places oe strategic importance and military notes. la Persia there are no modem fortresses, and no garrison towns in the sense ordinarily understood. In this report, instead of fortresses, special information will be given about points of strategic importance. These places have already been dealt with in Chapters II and IV. The same classification will be adhered to as in previous chapters, viz :— Section I .—Khorasan and Astarabad. This will be con sidered from the point of view of an invader from the north. Section II. —Azarbaijan, the Caspian Provinces, and the country as far south as the line demarcating the Russian sphere of influence. This section will be considered—- (а) as affecting an invader from the Caspian Sea or north- v est frontier; (?&gt;) as affecting an advance from Baghdad to Khaniqin, Kirmanshah, and Ramadan. Section III. —The neutral zone. Places of importance to an invader moving— («) from the head of the Persian Gulf to Ahwaz, Shushtar, Dizful, Khurramabad, Burujird; (б) from Ahwaz to Isfahan ; (c) from Bushire to ShT-raz; Section IV .—The British sphere. This will be considered as affecting troops moving from the coast line into the interior (a) from Bandar ’Abbas to Kirman and Yazd; (b) from the Makran coast northwards towards Sis tin and Meshed, and the country about Neh and Birjand. Section V .—Sistan.Section I. — Khordsdn»Astardbdd. Should a Kussian force be disembarked near Astarabad, there is nothing to prevent its occupying the whole ofKhorasan, after seizing the Shahrud-Bustan position. The districts that lie nearest to the border line, and that would be first called upon to support a friendly force, or to aid in repelling an invading enemy, are Meshed, Turbat-i-Haidari, Turshiz, Nishapur, and Sabzawar. Behind them westward, up to the old province of ’ Iraq, the coun try is in a military sense a blank, offering no pros pect of support to a defending force and no obstacles to inva sion. Nothing worthy of the name of a fortification exists on the Persian border; the forts being merely ruined towers. Sarakhs-i-Nau or Sarakhs-i-Nasiri is a frontier fortress, situated about 500 yards from the left bank of the Harl-Rud or Tejen. Its trace is that of an irregular polygon, with eleven bastions and numerous intermediate towers for musketry; On the south is the ark or citadel, which is a similar work to the above; in it are quarters for infantry and artillery; but many of the former live in lines in the centre of the fort. Out side the fort are a number of Turkoman towers; and round each of these is a small patch of ground, cultivated by the men of the garrison, and watered from canals. The soil is every where light and sandy, but as there is abundant water at a depth of about 20 feet, it should be capable of supporting large crops. The river here dries up in late summer or autumn, but in spring or after rain, it contains a considerable amount of water. The garrison consists of about 100 infantry and 6 guns with a detachment of artillerymen. The guns are quite useless. There are about 300 houses within the walls, and 200 in hamlets round about. Inside dwell some 150 families of Arab cultivators, and a very mixed lot of other inhabitants. Drinking water is ob tained from shallow wells, requiring frequent cleaning out; the water is muddy but good. Pul-i-Khatun, elevation 1,580', is a village with an old stone bridge, over the Hari Rud, repaired by the Russians in 1897. The river here forms the boundary between Persia and Russia.253 The village is about 94 miles from Meshed and has good water, fuel and forage. From here an army advancing on Herat could not follow the bed of the Harl Rftd, as tlxe track is bad and difficult, and only passable for small parties of horse or footmen, when the river is not in flood. A cart-road, practicable for field artillery and wheeled trans port, runs from here to Sarakhs, distant 47-3 miles. Helio graphic communication is maintained between the two places in fine weather. To Zulfikar, a distance of £0 miles, the road is suitable for camels, but impracticable for field artillery and wheeled trans port. The bridge here is passable for all arms, but the ford is diffi cult, being deep and the bottom encumbered with rocks. A small Russian cantonment, situated near the biidge, consists of two small one-stoiied barracks, stables, etc., a&gt;ccommo- dating a normal garrison of a sotnia of cossacks, 100 strono- and a frontier guard post of a commander, 18 mounted and 5 dismounted men, and 5 Turkomans. The district of Kalat-i-Hadiri belongs to Ehorasan, and is Kalat-i-Nadiri situated on the north-east frontier of Persia. It is 70 to 80 miles long and about 30 wide, and is defended by a number of as strong defiles as are to be found.in the world. It consists of a series of valleys, descending from the ridge to the plain, each confined by precipitous spurs. The lower ranges form a most intricate maze of ravines and glens. A large portion of this tract is uninhabited. Tlxe most important part is the plateau of Kalat, the famous natural fortress of Klxorasan, which lies in tlxe principal valley to the west ^ The drainage of tlxe plateau feeds the stream known as the Ab-i-Kalat. The plateau itself is an elevated tract of con siderable extent, rising in parts into mountains and traversed by many deep valleys. Enclosing it completely is a chain of heights or ridges, so narrow, lofty and precipitous as to form a perfect wall, penetrable only at a few points. The cliffs, forming this wall, rise from their bases to a height of 1,500 feet above tlxe level of the country, with a -wonderful completeness and uni formity. The total length of the plateau from east to west is254 about 18 miles, and its breadth varies from G to 10 miles, giving an area of nearly 150 square miles. The Kalat stream, which drains it, rises due south of Kalat, flows round its southern wall, and enters at the north-east corner by a remarkable natural gap in the rocky boundary known as the Darband, or defile of Arghavan Shah. This gap is some 400 yards long, and 40 wide at its narrowest point, where it is closed by flood gates. The crest of the cliffs is 500 feet above the stream, and so narrow as to barely afford foothold to a single man. The principal elevation is in the north-west corner, about 1,500 feet abov r e the valley, and 4,000 feet above the sea. The whole circuit of the cliffs enclosing the plateau cannot be less than 50 to 60 miles. Their crests form a narrow ridge slightly serrated, but of almost uniform height. Their interior slope falls away in either inaccessible inclines, or long easy undulations. Besides the Darband-i-Arghavan Shah, by which the stream enters the plateau, is the Darband-i-Nafta by which it leaves ; both of these are practicable for artillery. There are also three other “ gates ” practicable for horsemen, and at least four paths just practicable for infantry. All these paths are defended by towers, and might easily be rendered quite impassable. Every spot, where the hill offers the possibility of ascent, is either artificially scarped or stopped by loopholed walls ; while on each bit of level ground above Is a tower. If held in sufficient strength, it would be almost impossible to force it. The stream bed has obstructions in front, and flank ing walls built upon the face of the cliff for a distance of 200 yards or so. Kalat is thus an extremely strong position in which any number of troops could be collected, but has two very fatal sources of weakness. First it is situated to the north of an exceedingly difficult range of mountains, across which it would be very difficult to transport supplies, while practi cally none are procurable in the neighbourhood. Secondly, its size is a source of weakness, as it would require a large garrison. In its present state, with its slender garrison of half hearted soldiers scattered about the place, and separated from each other and from all support by miles of difficult andimpracticable roads, it is not probable that it would long resist successfully any skilful or determined attack. The garrison consists of two companies of infantry supplied from Meshed. No ■artillery is now stationed here. Major Bruce, who succeeded in scaling one of the outlying hill paths and entering the fortress, states that these paths are altogether impracticable, (a) at night, (6) in wet or bad weather, (c) without a guide. Major Sykes noted that the life of Kalat centres in the narrow valley, about 12 miles long, running nearly west to east between the Arghavan Shah and Nafta Darbands, where there is a strip of cultivation. Elsewhere aro 3 or 4 small villages dependent on rain crops. The interior is everywhere extremely hilly. The altitude of the main valley is 3,000', the climate unhealthy and hot in summer, and mos quitoes abound. The main water-supply is the river, but there aro also a few springs and ancient reservoirs. Both the plat eau and mountain slopes are entirely devoid of trees and shrubs. At present the plateau contains 8 villages inside the fortress, with a total population of about 4,000, chiefly Turkomans with some Arabs and a few Kurds. The produce of the cultivated area does not exceed local requirements, but considerable areas are available for extension. In the Meshed district every town and village is provided with defences of some sort; usually a long,'thin curtain wall of mud, with short circular projections for flanking defence, only useful against musketry. Many villages to the north have high raised mounds, popularly known as the sites of dtishdkdehs, or fire temples, large enough and high enough to form most efficient cavaliers, and almost indestructible by direct fire. Many of them have strong cells or chambers, that would serve as casemates. Such positions, improved and combined with somewhat better temporary outer lines of defence, would prove formidable obstacles to a force provided only with light guns. Between Meshed and Bujnurd, the w hole country is a suc cession of bare rocky mountain ranges running north-east and south-west, enclosing long narrow valleys, for the most part destitute of rivers, and dependent for their cultivation on256 kdrlzes, and small mountain streams. Mountains and valleys are absolutely bare of trees, except where cultivated ; low scrub j ungle affords fire wood in places, and everywhere camel grazing is to be found. In spring, a scanty and short lived grass appears and pas tures large flocks of sheep. Horses, mules and cattle are fed on chopped straw and dried lucerne. The Meshed valley, on the south-west edge of which the city is situated, is a narrow, cigar shaped depression 10 to 15 miles wide, and at least 150 miles long from north-west to south-east, contracting very rapidly at its south-east extremity. It is traversed by the Kashaf Rud [see Chapter II, Part (i)]. The south-west mountain wall approaches to rather more than 2 miles from the city, the intervening space being sandy, little cultivated and much intersected by qandts. From the south to the south-east of the citj^, lie low rocky hills, at distances varying from 5 to 15 miles. To the north-east, a fertile plain from 10 to 15 miles in width extends to the north-east range. Here the plain is dotted with frequent villages surrounded by cultivation. To the north, east, south-east and south, a belt of walled vineyards and fruit gardens extends outwards from -J mile to 1 mile from the walls. Six mam routes and five telegraph lines radiate from Meshed. The city averages from H to 1 mile in length by 1 mile in breadth, and is surrounded by a mud wall of irregular trace, with a circumference, roughly circular, of about 6 miles. At the angles are bastions in the shape of round mud towers and at intervals along the wall, small towers are distributed. The wall, originally 9 feet thick at the base and 4 at the top, Avith a small ditch belorv the rampart, a Ioav parapet on the crest of the counterscarp, and a broad, deep ditch beyond, is now in a most ruinous condition, while the ditch has in many places been filled up, and only presents its original dimensions near the Ark gate. At this point a small overflow stream exists in the ditch, by damming. Avhich an obstacle might be created. A rough road makes the circuit of the city.

Detachments, amounting in all to 250 men or so, are furnished from here to'Kalat-i-JSTadiri, Sarakhs and Muhsinabad. Eight muzzle-loading field guns are in front of the artillery barracks in the maiddn; and a percentage of artillerymen re side here. In the Ark are 3 more of these guns, all rifled, about 9-pounders, and in fairly good order. There are also in the Ark two brass mountain guns M. L., about 4-pounders, and nearly new. The district of Kuchan is important as being_the most pro- Kuchan. ductive tract and granary of Khorasan. The IlkhanI of the Za’afaranlu Kurds mounts and arms a body of 400 horse, which only require a little better discipline and better ^ arms to make them thoroughly efficient light horse, admirably fitted to perform most duties of mounted infantry, ihey do not charge home with sword or lance, their weapon being the rifle, which they use at speed, circling round or ^ ie- treating. About a third of them are stationed on the Khush- khaneh plateau, which has fine pastures, requires defence being the weakest point of the border, and is a convenient centre to raid from. The Ilkhani is bound to give military service, and to guard his border and the district in his rear. lie has a hereditary friendship with the Russians, from whom 10 receives presents. The town of Kuchan is fortified in the usual manner, and must have been a strong place at one time, the ditch being about 35 feet deep, and 30 feet broad, and the line of fortification about K miles in circumference. The walls were, however, greatly damaged by an earthquake, and have never boen r.e- paired. A mound, with the ruined citadel, stands m the middle of the town. To the north-east of the town at a distance of 2 500 or 3,000 yards, is a hill, rising about-150 feet, which completely commands the town. Two mam roads to Meshed from Askhabad and Astarabad join here. The importance of Tabas lies in the fact that it is the first lab s. cultivated area met with in the northern portion of the eastern Lut. The main caravan route from Yazd to Meshed traverses the district. Its chief wealth consists of sheep and camels. Ihe258 Tun. Astarabad District. 1 liter arc bred in great numbers and arc available for biro. The town of Tabas has a 'strong brick wall, looplioled, and strengthened by circular towers at intervals. A broad, deep, dry ditch surrounds it. There are two gateways on the east and west respectively, each flanked by a couple of round towers. The citadel is built on an immense mound, about 30 feet high, and is situated in the centre of the south face of the old. town. It is about 80 yards square, and has round towers at the corners and in the centre of each face. It is surrounded by a ditch ; and the gateway, to which access is obtained by a bridge, is in the north face. The grain grown here is insufficient for the requirements of the town, and more has to be imported from Dastgardun and Gunabad. Water is good and abundant. The best camping- ground is on the west side of the town. Although not on the main route from Yazd to Meshed, -Tabas is within striking distance of it, and would be useful as a post from which to block or secure, as the case might be, the passage of the Lut desert by this route. Similarly Tun, being the first town reached on the main road from Kirman to Meshed, is an important place. More over, the district of Tun is very largely cultivated and capable of furnishing considerable supplies, though water is scarce. Astarabad district is rendered by natural obstacles peculiar ly difficult of access. It is most open towards the Caspian, but there still intervene, between the town and shore, 14 miles of low swampy forest land, over which the impedivienta of an army could not bo transported, without the construction of a road and numerous bridges. Troops landed at Gumish-Tappeh might, by a detour, reach Astarabad without much difficulty, save in the time of flood. The western border is covered with impenetrable forest and traversed by numerous small streams flowing in deep muddy beds, The Shah ’Abbas causeway is now so ruined by neglect that it is of no use. As the streams flow in narrow permanent beds, and the supply of wood is unlimited, tho construction of a temporary road for troops would bo easy.

There are three , principal lines from this side which might be improved into fair military roads. To the east the district is shut in by hilly country, through which there is one magnificent natural pass to the eastern provinces. To the north is the desert, across which are several very difficult routes. Large armies have, nevertheless, within recent times been marched into, and maintained for some months about, Astar- abad. Astarabad town is enclosed within a crenelated mudAstaiabad wall, about 35 feet high, and 3 to 4 miles in circumference, town ’ flanked by round towers. The ditch is mostly filled up, and the defences so ruinous as to bo useless, but they could speedily bo put into order. The town is overlooked by the Sar-i-Gul hill to the west, the ridge of which would have to be occupied by a small re doubt, water being obtained from a stream below. Works would also be required on the hills, within rifle shot on the south side, to modernize the defences. There is cover all round, to within a few yards of the ditch, consisting of thick, impervious, thorn bush, difficult to cut and impossible to burn. The thorn bush could be utilized for constructing obstacles. Shahrud lies so near Ashurada, that it could easily he occupi- Shahrud. ed by the Russians. There is sufficient water throughout the summer for a force of 60,000 men, and the district is very pro ductive. It would be difficult to invest the town, if properly fortified. After seizing the Shahrud-Bustan defile, a force could ad vance up the valley of the Gurgan, and over the Kafr and Sul tan Mefidan passes on Meshed. The best route to Shahrud from Astarabad is by the Quzluq pass, elevation 6,560 feet, over which, even in its present condi tion, guns have been taken by hand. The occupation, by the Russians, of the line Astarabad- Shahrud, would deny access to Khorasan to any Persian troops from the direction of Tehran.260 Section II.—The Caspian Provinces, Azarbdljdn, and the remainder of the Russian sphere of influence. There are few countries more completely protected by nature against external aggression than Gllan, for its coast is lined with a belt of impenetrable forest, behind which are deep “murddbs” or backwaters a,nd extensive morasses. On the south tho mountain passes are steep, difficult and long, and any force surmounting them would then find itself entangled in a maze of jungles and morasses, impervious without a guide. The province of Mazandaran resembles Gilan in places, but to a very modified extent. Tehran is connected with tho Caspian seaports (see Chapter VIII) by good communications through both the above provinces. It has no defences of any account, and its chief importance is that common to all capitals, viz., it is the seat of government. In 1870 a new rampart was constructed round the city, copied from tho fortifications of Paris before tho war of 1870. There is no masonry in this rampart, and not a single gun is mounted. The enceinte is II miles, and there are 12 gateways, strong, lofty archways, but useless for serious resistance. Tho surrounding country is a level plain. The city is well situated, being 500 miles from the north west frontier, while, from tho Caspian, the Elburz affords an excellent lino of defence. It has a central position command ing routes to the most valuable provinces of the kingdom, is half way between Meshed and Tabriz, and so able to control the provinces of which they are the centres, a .d is in easy supporting distance of the northern maritime provinces. Moreover, it stands as an advanced outpost to the older capitals of Shiraz and Isfahan, whither, in case of disaster in the north, the court might fall back. Rasht owes its importance to the sea port of Enzali, and to tho Russian road from it to Tehran. Very minor improvements only would be necessary to increase largely tho value of the port, viz., the dredging of the Enzali bar, and the deepening or widen ing of the creek and river, or the making of a canal right up to Rasht, to save unloading at Enzali.

For hostile troops advancing from the north, only the country between the Kara Dagh and Mount Ararat need be considered. The Kara Dagh mountains, being practically an impassable barrier, limit the field of operations on that side. Tho objectives of a hostile force would bo Tabriz and Urumieh. To reach these places, routes must be taken which necessarily pass by Maraud and Khol, the only points where tho Mesho , Dagh is pierced by good roads. These are important strategic positions, and any scheme of defence must take both into con sideration. Between them stretches the lofty wall of tho Mesho Dagh, south of which runs an excellent road, affording lateral communication between tho two places. Again behind Maraud and Kh5I the mountains lend themselves naturally to defence and fortified positions, and could easily be supported from Tabriz and Urumieh. Troops advancing from Julfa and tho Aras valley could Julfa. do so with ease. Julfa is the terminus of the Russian railway. There are here an iron bridge, a ferry, and also throe fords. The Russians have constructed a road from hero to Tabriz, which they intend to prolong, to join their Rasht road at Kazvm; this was constructed in such a manner, that it may easily bo converted into a railway, and is now used for motors. Maraud is a small town, commanded on all sides, where the Marand. main roads from Julfa and Trebizond converge. It is situated between two desolate barren ranges, and can only be turned at Khol. . Kh5I is a walled town, a quadrilateral of bastion trace. Khol. The bastions are small circular towers at every 80 yards, some large enough to hold one gun, giving flanking fire on ^to tho main ditch. The curtain is a mud wall 24 high. The interior wall is built up to within 8 of the top of the parapet, so as to form a roadway 6 / wide, i ho parapet is loop-holed, givincr direct fire at a steep angle on to the main ditch, which is 50'°broad. The outer line of defence is of the ordinary field work description, massive and broad with a good command, and has small ravelins thrown out at intervals. The secon ditch is about 40' broad and 15' deep, with the escarp and coun- ■ tersearp at sharp angles. Tho whole is in a very fair state of preservation. Access to the five gates is by wooden budges. Tho Ark, a largo waited enclosure, contains an arsenal with good262 Tabriz. UTumleh. Khaiuq'in. vaulted chambers, which are dry and well kept, and contain rifles, ammunition and stores. The possession of Kh5I would bo regarded by the natives as equivalent to' the possession of Azarbaijan. It is anticipated that the Chief of Maku, who has 7,000 irregular troops, horse and foot, would throw in his lot with the stronger power ; while the Kurdistan nomad tribes would bo a source of weakness, as they would probably rise and plunder the provinces indiscriminately. Tabriz has nominally a large garrison of all arms and in the ruined ark is an arsenal which contains rifles, cartridges and guns, but since the siege of 1909, there is no information as to what remains. Urumieh is surrounded by walls and a deep ditch, which can be filled with water, and is also encircled by orchards. The sur rounding country is one large plain of extraordinary produc tiveness. The occupation by Russia of Tabriz would place her favourably for a further advance on Tehran or Hamadan. The occupation of Urumieh would give her command of two import ant roads loading into Turkey, to Van and Musal respective ly, giving access to the Tigris valley and the Persian Gulf. Sho would also be well placed for a further advance on Kir- manshah. Azarbaijan would also furnish her with men renowned for pluck and endurance, who, disciplined and led by Euro peans, would probably make fino soldiers. -ykli. elevation ■ ' iigiected with hi! sfc, The walls a jj the moat is e: nichUie city f .sill miles east tc liftaty of water, i ijsijfls for 10,000 &amp; In arsenal here among which a all, elevation 5,91 ait many roads rad sjealv important, saai water and s ■»r days Hamad nil reference to £ steia.

It has also been recognized as the most favourable lino for a railway, and as far back as 1884, an attempt was made by a Persian to secure a concession for this purpose. Since then Persians, Germans and French have endeavoured to obtain and work concessions for a railway, service of motor cars, and road-mak ing. The only tangible result up to date is that the Russians obtained a concession to extend their road from Kazvin to Hamadan, and duly completed the work in 1908. Khaniqin, elevation 1,250', is the frontier town in Turkish territory on this route. The Turkish government keep a small garrison here. 3 ever.

The walls are 3 miles in circumference, but in ruins, and the moat is encumbered with their debris. The plain, on which the city stands, is 6 miles from north t&lt;3 south, and 30 miles east to west, studded with small villages. There is plenty of water, and the officials report they could easily get supplies for 10,000 men. This is a good centre for buy ing mules. An arsenal here contains a miscellaneous collection of weapons, among which are a few good rifles. Hamadan, elevation 5,930', lies on the edge of a fertile plain and from it many roads radiate, making it commercially as well as strategically important. Mules can be purchased in large numbers, and water and supplies are plentiful. In former days Hamadan was considered strategically im portant, with reference to a plan for defending Turkey in Asia against Russia. At the present day, its importance lies in the fact that it would probably become a great secondary base of operations for any Russian force descending on south-west Persia. Here an army could collect its supplies, and proceed advantageously with the further advance southwards, so long as its western flank were not threatened by a disciplined force. The present railway schemes for linking Hamadan with Baghdad and eventually Tehran, make the place more import ant than ever. Isfahan is situated in the midst of a large plain, extending about 75 miles from east to west and 20 miles from north to south, enclosed by mountains, and well-watered by the Zindeh Pud. Scarcely a vestige remains of its encircling walls, which were 20 miles in circumferenc. With the exception of the road to Burujird and Kirmanshah, which is closed by snowfall in winter, all roads in this district are open for the movement of troops practically throughout the year, and if closed by snow, it is only for a day or two. The hill passes are comparatively easy. Rivers are few, and all fordable. Irrigation channels in the plain are numerous, and larger canals would occasionally impede movement, as some have no fords, and, especially during the rains, present some diffi culty. Large rivers can be crossed by means of rafts. Wheat h extensively grown in the Isfahan plain. Kirmanshahi Hamadan.

The ark used to bo heavily fortified, and is still strong enough to resist •an ill-armed mob. Yazd is the starting point of the main caravan route across the' desert to Meshed. Transport is scarce, bread stuffs are all imported, the produce of the surround ing country in a good year only suffices the inhabitants for three months, though further supplies can be brought in from a distance. Section III.—The neutral zone. (a). The head of the Persian Gulf to Ahwdz, Shushtar, Dizful, Khurramabdd and Buriijird. For Muhammareh and Khor Musa, see Chapter VIII. From Muhammareh to Ahwaz there -would be no difficulty in transporting infantry and supplies by river, but herses and transport animals would have to march. The existing river steamers and barges are not suitable for carrying animals, and it would be difficult to transfer them from the sea transports direct to the river boats. The river at Muhammareh runs with a strong stream and cross currents, making it dangerous to swim animals ashore, and landing in boats locally available would bo slow and difficult. It is true that in the Persian War, 1857, the cavalry disembarked, in the presence of the enemy, a short distance up the Shatt-al-Arab; but to march up the Karun, the road follows the right bank as far as Kut-ul-Amlreh, where it would be necessary to cross the main stream by boats. Near Muhammareh the ground is a good deal cut up by irrigation and liable to be flooded, and therefore difficult for tlie move ment of troops or guns. There is no road up the left bank, the ground there being low and swampy and intersected by two large branches of the river. For this line, therefore, for mounted units and transport Khur Musa would be the best landing place. From Ma’shur there are two routes to Ahwaz and one to Muhammareh. The mud flats of Khur Musa, however, are liable to become impassable in wet weather.

It stands upon a somewhat high bank, and behind it is a desert. The village consists of about 160 houses, mostly built of biick, and the population numbers some 800, mainly Arabs, but there are some Persians. The people are chiefly agricul tural. The country, on the town side of the Karun, is a bare plain with slight patches of cultivation hero and there. To the south-east is a range of sand-stone hills, perfectly bare, and a few hundred yards to the north is a ridge, round which the river passes, rendering it a very strong position. The great plain, between the Karun river and the Ramuz district, lies entirely in the Ahwaz district; it is generally grassy and sprinkled with patches of wheat cultivation. After rain it becomes swampy, and in some seasons mosquitoes are trouble some. The permanent villages are, almost without exception, on the Karun. Bandar Nasiri or Nasirleh is situated on the left bank of the Karun immediately below the rapids, and about 1 mile from Ahwaz. It stands on a slight elevation overlooking the river, has 118 houses of stone, brick and mud, a number of shops, and a population of about 1,500, Shushtarls, Dizfulls, and Arabs. The Lynch road to Isfahan starts from here. A tramway with 3 foot gauge and length of about 2,500 yards, conveys goods, landed at the foot of the rapids, to the top beyond Ahwaz for reshipment., and vice versa. The line is badly laid with no ballast. There are probably about 6 trollies working, with a carrying surface of about G' S' x 4' 9', each drawn by one horse. The ground is well adapted for an extension of the line up or down the river, or even to Ramuz. At various points the sur rounding country is liable to be submerged after rain. From Ahwaz to Dizful the country is easy for pack transport, except in wet weather and it would not be difficult to construct a cart road. There are boats on the river to supplement the land transport as far Shalaili. Shushtar owes its strategic importance to its situation Shushtar. geographically and its accessibility from the Karun. The cita del or kaleh was in former days very strong, but is now command ed at short range from part of the town, and at longer ranges from the hills on the west bank of the Shatait. On the lower ground, to the west of the citadel, is an arsenal, which has a266 DlEful. Considerable open space between it and the town. There are throe exits:— the first to the west, by means of a ferry which takes the place of the broken Pul-i-Dizful; the second by the Pul-i-Lashkar into the Mianab, and the third over the dam by the Pul-i-Biilaiti to the east. Towards the southern extremity of Dizful the river is span ned by an ancient bridge, 430 yards in length, and built on 24 arches resting cn piers. The latter are of large blocks of cut stone the superstructure being of brick with a roadway mostly 16' wide and roughly cobbled. The parapets m some sections have disappeared. Several of the arches have been swept away and replaced by narrower structures. From Dizful to Khurram- abad and Burujird, the road is almost closed owing to the atti tude of the predatory tribes along it, and is only a fair mule track. Colonel Bell, with reference to converting it into a car- road,’classed 57 miles as good and level, merely requiring the removal of large boulders, 60 miles as fair, requiring to be widen ed and cleared of stones, and 40 as bad requiring to be widened and zigzagged. From Khurramabad a mule track runs to Kirmanshah, requiring a large amount of work and rock cutting to convert it into a cart track. Colonel Bell, as far back as 1892, pointed out that the coun try from Shushtar to Burujird and Qum, is more favourable to railway construction than any other line entirely confined to Persian territory. Also that the area, Kirmanshah-Sinneh- Buruiird-Hamadan, is capable of playing an important part m the defence of Persia and the Persian Gulf, and how very necessary it is that ready access should be given to it by the river Karun to Shushtar, and thence by rail or road to Kirmanshah. The country enclosed in the semi-circle, fcmnoh, Hamadari and Burujird, not only protects the eastern outlets of all the passes across the Kurdistan hills to Van, but also the whole of south-west Persia from Isfahan to the Gulf and nrevents any hostile advance across the Lur, Bakhaan Qashqai hills. Other authorities describe the mountainous country on this lino as comparatively easy and the route, as a whole, the easiest from the sea into the interior of Persia, though somewhat diffi cult owing to snow, during the winter months. asi# to Lub, i : ;;®r rears by tie tk iliSai Abgit at any difficulty, junta over tiler atMtmth tie first si iiramiei wt ik&amp;iri, atffii tjai aligkt railway shear Airamiei S force for at lea i (Mon 5,985', k tie Cietar -ie a few thousand aBakitianoounti jib at tie varic mount varies pve on supplio Tie min jifiheBakhtiaf few men ifet cleared.

(b) From Ahwdz through the BaJchtidrl country to Isfahan .— ‘ Ahramieh. Carts could move freely as far as Ahramieh 41| miles, three stages, in fine weather, though the sand is heavy in places to the east of Mulla Sani. A light railway could be run out to Ahramieh without any difficulty, no bridges would be required, and the earthwork would be easy. If it were required to move troops in any numbers over this road, railway plant might with advantage be sent out with the first transport, and laid down as quickly as possible. Ahramieh would be a very much better place than Bandar Nasiri, at which to collect transport, as the low hills to the east of it afford excellent grazing, especiallly during the winter and spring. The space for camps is unlimited. Presum ing that a light railway were laid down, and an advanced depot formed near Ahramieh, transport for the supplies of the whole force for at least 145 miles (11 stages), as far as Ardal, elevation 5,985', w r ould be required. If an advance beyond this were to be made, agents sent ahead could possibly collect, in the Chehar Mahal and Linj an districts, sufficient to enable a few thousand men to be pushed on rapidly to Isfahan, but the Bakhtiarl country would not bear the strain of a large force passing through. There is generally a certain quantity of supplies at the various halting places on the Lynch road, but the amount varies from time to time. It has been calculated that the maximum force that could normally live on supplies obtainable in the Bakhtiari Garmsir is 6,500 men. The minimum force that could safely enter the district, if the Bakhtiarls were hostile, is 1,000 men ; owing to the difficulty of arranging for the proper piquetting of the hills, an absolutely necessary precaution in this district, where, in many places, a few men could hold up an army, unless the heights were first cleared. The Kliurramabad-Burujird road to the west and the Bu- shire-Isfahan road to the east, both offer greater facilities for troops than any of the tracks through the Bakhtiari country. (c) From Bushire to Shiraz. For Bushire see Chapter VIII. Shiraz has boon fully described geographically. It is reportedthat supplies could be collected to maintain a division of troops. It could, therefore, be conveniently utilized as an advanced base for a force moving into the interior from Bushire. The best times of year for military operation in this district are from the 1st April to the middle or end of May, and from the 21st Septem ber to 15th November, but climatic conditions here are never at any time sufficiently bad to cause a complete suspension of operations. The main route, following the telegraph from Bushire, is well known, but the very difficult k idols and scarcity of water on it make it an indifferent line of advance, for even a brigade. The more circuitous Firuzabad route, by which the Persian artillery was brought down in 1856 is preferable, though, in its present condition, the passage of field guns would entail a consi derable amount of road-making. Once Shiraz were occupied, the telegraph route would be useful, for supply convoys. Khisht, elevation about 1,800', situated on this route in a plain 10 miles long and 5 broad, well supplied with water and fuel, is con sidered the first place from Bushire where European troops could be permanently kept during the summer months ; and even here they would suffer severely from the heat, from July to Sep tember. Kazarun, elevation 2,800', near the foot of the Kutal-i- Dukhtar is not so hot, though July and August would be trying for Europeans. It is estimated that 3,000 troops could be supplied here. The town is 70 miles from Shiraz and 95 from Bushire, and recommended as a suitable site for a depot. Without previous warning, a battalion of native infantry, with transport, could probably obtain sufficient supplies at each of the halting places on the post road. The number of troops moving at one time on the road would be limited more by the question of water than by that of supplies. Two battalions together would not find sufficient water at all seasons. The route,is, there fore, unsuitable for cavalry, except in small parties, and also many horses would be lamed by the rocky nature of the track. The alternative route via Firuzabad passes through moun tainous country, and crosses a succession of bare rocky ranges. This area is very sparsely populated, about 15 miles being the average distance betw eon villages, while in some cases it is over 20. Numerous ruins shows signs of former prosperity. Every viilago, however small, has a patch of cultivation around it, the269 intervening country being barren. Wherever the road crosses mountain ridges it is very bad, affording room for loaded mules in single file only. In other places the dry beds of nalds form the favourite path. Small parties of cavalry could obtain sufficient supplies; water for horses is almost always available, though brackish in places. There is a certain amount of grazing after the rains, but during the hot months the grass becomes sparse and scorched up. Limited supplies of barley and bhusa are procurable at the villages. Field artillery would be in constant difficuties, but the road could be made practicable by working parties. If guns were lequired to come into action, positions could be obtained cover ing the mouths of defiles ; but the higher ground is, as a rule, inaccessible, owing to the rocky precipitous nature of the hill sides. Infantry would find the marches very trying, 16 miles about here being considered a short march (due to want of water.) It is the only arm that could act efficiently in many places, the face of the country being rugged and broken. Machine guns would be useful. These passes can seldom be turned, owing to the precipitous nature and length of the ranges. There are lateral communications to the north, but to the south only a few rough foot tracks are available. During the hot months, it is sufficiently cool for marching up to 9 A.M., but it would be difficult to find suitable halting places half way through a march, as shade does not exist, and water is seldom obtainable. European troops would find the heat very trying, during the hot weather, from Bushire to Kalimeh. The Kalimeh. elevation of Kalimeh is 1,100', and it is the first good halting place at that season. It is an important strategical point, being at a junction of routes, and therefore suitable for a depot. Forage is abundant here during the spring. Flruzdbdd, elevation 4,180/ is well situated, along this line, Simzabal. for a halting place and supply depot. It has been described as in every way suitable for a cantonment. The extensive plain around the town is extremely fertile and well-watered, and forms one of the best corn-producing and grazing districts in Persia; it varies in breadth from 7 to 5 miles. There are ex cellent camping grounds, and supplies available for a large force. Fuel in large quantities can be brought in from Mahmand ; else where between here and Bushire there is a dearth of it. Va-270 Jahrum. Fasa. Supplies. Fort. rious roads radiato from Flruzabad and an important lateral route runs to Jain'am, a much larger place and strategically noteworthy by reason of the number of routes that converge there. But, as regards climate, supplies and fertility of the surrounding country, it is much inferior to Firuzabad. Be tween Jahrum and Fasa the country differs from that nearer Bushire, as the valleys separating the chains of hills are much broader and more level, being in fact small plains. The road between the two places is excellent, but rather circuitous. The route ascends the Avhole way with a gentle slope over a succession of plains, and is passable throughout for all arms. The country affords facilities for troops to move and fight, and their action here would not be continually cramped by bad ground, as is the case near the coast. Fasa is situated in a large and fertile plain, much irrigated, well populated and well watered ; during the rains parts of the country become swampy and impassable. It is important as a possible halting place or depot. The passes from here to Lake Niriz are compa ratively easy, and could be turned. Section IV.—The British sphere. The size of columns in Persia, (unless operating against the regular army of a great Power), is limited more by con siderations of water and supply, than the prospect of armed resistance. This is especially the case in the zone of the British sphere of influence. Probably two battalions, with a section of a mountain battery, could move anywhere without difficulty through this area. In most places, it would not bo possible to march more than half a brigade at a time. The water supply is very apt to vary, according to the season, and is obtained usually from wells and qandts. Except across the deserts, a whole brigade might be marched, if a battalion of Pioneers were sent ahead to clear out existing wells and dig others, if necessary, and, in case of qandts, to construct reservoirs to collect water before the arrival of the troops. In this part of Persia all supplies should invariably be car ried, until it has been actually found that sufficient (quantities aio at the time locally procurable.

Tufangchi torvors resemble lofty blockhouses with the door raised some distance above the ground. They are square, built of stone, loop-holed, and capable of holding a garrison of 15-20 men. The most useful classes of men for guides would be the Guides. Lsvy Savars attached to the consulates and the caravan men. Levy Savars are mainly recruited from Afghans, Baluchis, and occasionally Turkomans. They generally have considerable experience of the country, and accompany the Consul on tour, being more useful for this purpose than men of the escorts.

In general, Persia, Avith its lofty ranges of hills and broad Signalling, intervening plains, is an ideal country for signalling, but the atmosphere may be obscured for several days at a time by heavy dust haze. With clear weather a chain of stations might easily be organised betAveen Bandar ’Abbas and Slstan. The wind might be found to interfere at times with heliograph signalling to a certain extent. The atmosphere is generally clear when the wind is not blowing. The only possible route across the Lut desert, for troops crossing the from the south, appears to be that followed by the telegraph Lut desert, line between Bam and Sxstan. Even Persian caravans avoid tho route between Neh and Kirman, though Afghan caravans are said to go through here after rain. Troops, attempting to cross from Khorasan to Kirman, would folloxv some route from Turbat-i-Haidari or Birjand through Kaiband. This Avould, it is said, nowhere involve the passage of a greater extent of waterless desert than 30 to 40 miles. During the hot months, it wouldprobably be quite impossible for even the smallest force to cross.272 Cavalry. Intelligence officers. . From Blrjand to Khabis or Haur direct, the passage, even during the winter months, would involve great risk. The dis tance from water to water on this line, is 125 to 140 miles, and during these months there are dangerous blizzards. Following the route of the Central Persian Telegraph between Robat and Narmashir, the passage would be quite feasible for troops. _ Under present conditions of water supply, two battalions with full camel transport might cross but water for men should be carried on the longer stages. Dur ing the hot months, however, it should not be attempted except for very urgent reasons. If the wells were cleared out in advance, etc., even a full brigade with transport might cross. Sandstorms constitute a danger to bo reckoned with. Villages would be much more likely to bring supplies for sale to places, where they would not be under the influence of Mullas and others. In southern Khorasan, men mounted on riding camels are preferable to cavalry. Grazing may be considered practically non-existent, and bhusd is often difficult to obtain. Distances between water are frequently 30 miles, and seldom less than 20. Grain is very scarce in many parts. The surface of the country is covered with rocks, and the hilly portions unsuited for men mounted on horses. A small force of cavalry should, how ever, always accompany a force, for the moral impression they create. x ^ In Persian Baluchistan water is more plentiful than in south ern Khorasan. Grass is nearly always obtainable from neigh bouring hills, and usually sufficient hkusd or hurbl at even small villages for about 100 horses. Special transport arrangements for grain and forage would be necessary for any cavalry force, stronger than one squadron along most of the routes in Persian Baluchistan. An Intelligence officer should never believe, and never trust a Persian, or rely on his promises in any w r ay whatsoever. In dealing with the lower class Persian, formal interroga tion should be avoided, much good information can be obtained in the course of friendly conversation.

Half-a-mile to the easfof the city rises a limestone crag, some 500 feet above the plain, upon which are built the two forts 0 Kirman The first, Kaleh Ardashir, has walls of colossal sun-dried bricks,jesting on stone foundations, still in almost perfect order; below, on a westerly spur, is a second keep, from which the road winds up to the castle on the crest and which possesses a triple line of defence. The second fort’ Kaleh-i-Dukhtar, is situated on another crag of smaller dimen sions, half-a-milo north-west of Kaleh Ardashir; and between these two were the palace and other buildings, now all in ruins. On the southern spur of the main crag is a detached cliff with 143 steps hewn out of the rock leading up it; immediately below is the deserted quarter of Farmitan. In the plain, ruins are plentiful. • 1 ’ The city is surrounded by a clay wall, in a good state of repair about 30 feet high, with a ditch 40 feet wide and 10 feet neep, forming an irregular hexagon, measuring roughly a mile from east to west, and slightly more from north to south touching it, on the west side, is the Ark, in which the Governor- boneral resides, and which contains the post and telegraph omces, barracks and arsenal, all in good repair. In addition to the untrained and badly-armed garrison of all arms, several ovies of horse and foot do police work along the main roads, the nomad tribes of the district are fine raw material, which might be converted into excellent cavalry. Bam is served by three main caravan routes, of which the one to Bandar ’Abbas vid Jiruft, is a good road, but troubled at times by Bashakardi nomads. Caravans take 15 to 20 da™ between here and Bandar ’Abbas. The main caravan route to bistan, connects within three marches to the east. Bam conta in* a celebrated fort in the old town, built of sun-dried bricks with an outer and inner wall, each 40' high, and provided with stroim Bam.Persian Balu chistan. Bampur, 274 gateways. There are a few antiquated field-guns inside, and a garrison is supposed to be located here, but is usually conspic uous by its absence. The old town is also surrounded by a high wall and ditch. From Chahbdr inland towards Sistdn .—Owing to chronic unrest for centuries, the whole of Persian Baluchistan contains many forts, almost every village possessing one. These are built of mud, set almost as hard as rock, usually on an eminence, and rectangular in shape, with well-arranged flank defences, provided by towers and bastions. In the centre is the citadel, rising to 40' or 50' in height, and divided into two portions, connected by covered ways. Its plinth is usually filled up to half its height with solid earth, and has a well sunk right through the mound on which the fort is built. The walls of the citadel vary from 5' to 10' in thickness, and the entrance to it is always up a steep narrow passage, admitting the approach of only one person at a time. Against the perimeter of the outer wall the houses of the village are constructed, frequently ar ranged in tiers prepared for defence, and surrounded by another loopholed wall, with flanking arrangements. Loop-holed battle ments, 2' thick and 5' high, fringe the outer edge of the walls and machicouli galleries are also frequently provided. The loopholes are usually badly planned, and the field of fire from them greatly restricted. These forts are commonly built on the edge of a grove near a Jcdriz, and have a clear field of fire for about 100 yards. The approaches are usually easy, as the date groves afford good cover. Mountain guns are of not much use against the majority. They could, however, demolish the battlements of the towers and assist the infantry in keeping down the enemy’s fire, while gun cotton was being lodged in a suitable place to blow up the wall or gate. Large numbers of rifles in the past have be&lt; n smuggled over from Masqat, so the probability is that there is one rifle now to every two or three men. Bampur possesses some importance due to roads or tracks leading from the coast converging here, and continuing rorth- wards to Khorasan and Sistan. There arc also routes from the interior via Kirman, and from British Baluchistan via Magas. i fort stands oi plain, sras hilt, tat is ^repair.

It was of importance before the Fehruj fort was built, but is now more or less abandoned, and is not in good repair. Anrple camping grounds, and good camel grazing exist, but the climate and water supply are bad. The fort at Fehruj, or Fahreh, 15J miles east of Bampur, Fehrnj. was liuilt about 1892, and is in a good state of repair. It is not a place of any strength, being merely a fortified caravanserai, about 80 yards long, by 80 broad, with seven towers. It contains a storeroom, woi'kshops with artificers, stables, and quarters for the Governor, staff, and garrison of all arms. The climate is no better than Bampur. A sandy plain stretches along the south of the Pampur dis trict, and to the north-east also there is desert. In the centre, however, is a thickly-wooded fertile strip of country along the river. Sarhad has the best climate in Persian Baluchistan and an Sarhad. abundant water supply; though cold in winter, it is temperate insummer, and, with an elevation of 4,500'at Vasht (or Kwash) is well suited for the location of the British troops, while within 30 miles of Vasht on the slopes of Kuh-i-Taftan, exist many places suitable for hill stations, except that there is an entire lack of supplies, for which the district is dependent on Sistan. The soil on the eastern and southern sides of the Kuh-i- Taftan is very fertile, and there are good streams of excellent water. The present lack of local supplies is due merely to the chronic state of lawlessness in Sarhad. Under existing condi tions to raise a crop is to invite a raid. British troops, located in Sarhad, would threaten any hostile advance from the north towards the coast and a direct' line of communications to Chahbar or Bandar’Abbas is possible, through country in which the inhabitants are well disposed towards the British. The tribes of Sarhad are said to have a fighting strength of some 3,000 men, badly armed, with no combination, and con stantly at feud among themselves. Mlrjawa, elevation 2,800/ is an area of geographical Mlrjawa, and strategic importance along a disputed frontier. Withregard to this, a compromise was effected in 1905 between the British and Persian Governments. Persia has the water supply, but the British are allowed the use of it. It is at the junction of three routes, which turn the Kuh-i-Taf- tan on its east side for any force advancing from the north, (i) from Ladis via Sangun, (ii) from Ladis via Andar and Gazlr, (in) along the border via Gurani and Maksotagh. New Mirjawa is in British territory and is in a good posi tion to control the trade along these roads, as well as those to -Talk and Dizak, and protect the Nushki route against DamanT raiders. Ladis affords an excellent site for a cantonment, since it has an elevation of 4,186 feet and there is an abundant supply of good grass. The British post of Robat, elevation 2,800', is 373 miles from Nushki and at the 21st stage. It contains a thana, post and telegraph office, serai, baniais shop, officers’ quarters and levy lines. The strength of the levies here is 8 mounted men and 4 dismounted. Under present arrangements, camp accommoda tion is always ready for half a battalion of Indian infantry. There is a hill sanatorium adjacent. Nasratabad Sipi, elevation 3,836', is a village and fortified post in the Kirman district, on the caravan track across the Lut from Bam to Sistan. It is situated in a valley, which in wet weather is completely under water, and in dry weather is thickly covered with white saline efflorescence. There is a mud fort here, with walls 30' high and fortified with nine round towers. Each face is 100 yards long, and the place can accommodate 350 men. Owing to earthquakes it is in a ruinous condition. A levy post of about 100 men is maintained here for the protec • tion of the caravans. The water from qandts is brackish but drinkable. Neh, elevation 4,023,' is situated on an elevated barren stony plain surrounded by hills, and is well supplied with pro visions. It lies in a hollow in the middle of the plain and con sists of a ruined mud fort on a mound with a citadel held by a few men. Its importance is due to the fact that it is an ad vance post on the main route to Birjand from Sistan, and a track (a very bad one owing to lack of water) leads from here to Kirman across the Lut. There are 8 qandts and a fair amount of cultivation.Blijand is about 240 miles south of Meshed and situated Birjaud. on the northern slopes of a barren stony valley, principally on tho left bank of a river bed, dry except after very heavy snow or rain. Water is obtained from irrigation channels. Tlie town walls are in ruins. The Ark is situated at the foot of the hill to the east, and is a huge square enclosure with tho usual bastions and towers. It is of no importance, being in a dilapi dated state, and commanded from the north-west, north and north-east. Some 30 artillery men with antiquated guns are stationed here, and nominally a battalion of infantry. To the west of the town, at the end of the spur, is situated a fort, which is a more important work. It is a square of about 100 yards, ‘with walls 40 feet high, built on the river bank, which is scarped to the north ; the approaches from all directions are difficult and steejo. It is ao present in a ruinous and useless state, but, if put into good repair, might be held against infantry. Cover exists close up to it, and it is commanded by a hill about 1,500 yards to the east. Sistan is favourably adapted for defence against invasion Ststan. from the north, and a comparatively small force here should bo able to hold in check a much larger hostile force. In normal yeans, from April to November, a vast expanse of water or marsh stretches from Kaleh-i-Kang on the north-west, past Chakansur, and extends along the northern and western extremities as far sonth as the overflow of the Hamun to the Shilag river. In years of flood even unladen animals can only be taken across this with great difficulty by a few recognised routes. Were a hostile force to succeed in crossing this, the country remains a network of canals, and watercuts only kept from over flowing by protective embankments. The cutting of these would turn any position the enemy had taken up&gt; into a morass, or an island. Colonel McMahon’s views on the military position of Sistan may be briefly stated as follows :—The geo graphical position and productiveness of the country make it a most important strategic point, a fact fully recognised by Russia, who might, owing to its present defenceless condition, attempt to seize it at, or even before, th'e outset of hostilities with Britain. A rapid movement from Zulfikar, via Kariz, by a small mobile force would not be difficult. Once established m Sistan, even a small force would be difficult to dislodge before a larger force came to its support. It would appear ofprimary importance to prevent the possibility of a small Russian force suddenly seizing Sistan. Owing to the country being so favourably adapted for defence against invasion from the north, especially in the summer, a small defending force, with know ledge of the ground, should be able to do this. In summer the depth of the stretch of water at the crossing of the Hamun is 2 to 4 feet, and much deeper in other places, while through the reed beds regular recognised routes are cut. The bed of the Hamun is full of holes and ruts and the bottom of a soft sticky nature. The width of water varies from 12 to 15 miles in a straight line, but the actual distance traversed in crossing (except in the very southern portion) is 15 to 20 miles. Good guides are required in any case. A se rious obstacle to troops therefore exists, even if unopposed. To drag guns across would take days of immense labour. Baggage, etc., would have to be transported by tutins (rafts of reeds) worked by Saiyads, the only people who understand them, and who are very lazy and independent. The violent wind, usually prevalent in summer, sometimes raises a heavy sea on the Ha mun, and the tutins cannot cross for days. Broad heavy tutins carry about 10 to 12 maunds, or about 10 men, and are very perishable. The reeds from which they are made, are cut when high and kept in dry stacks. A force holding Sistan should secure, and guard or destroy, all such stacks and also seize all existing enlist the co-operation of the Saiyad tribe, and prevent them giving any assistance to the invaders. An enemy, attempting to throw an advanced line without impedimenta across the Hamun, could be met by an unseen foe in the reeds, and, disheartened and exhausted by crossing, should be made short work of by comparatively few opponents, v/hile retreat would be impossible. On windy days the labour of crossing would be increased, while on calm days the plague of biting insects would demoralize any men unprotected by muslin face and hand bags. Even if a force did succeed in crossing, as has already been explained, the embankments might be cut and the country flooded. In Mian Kang! these difficulties would also bo enhanced by the dense tamarisk jungle. It may be admitted that a force, unopposed, with local assistance, and given time, could effect a crossing, but, in face of armed opposition, during the summer months, it is noi believed possible. In winter the difficulties would be compara-tlvely less, but still very severe. Much water is still left in the Hainun, and the routes across are few, so a limited and definite number of points would have to be watched. To reach the Hamun through Persia, a stretch of waterless country, 40 miles wide, must be crossed. West of the Hamun is a desert. A Russian force would probably take the shortest route, from Kariz via Zainulabad to the Hamun at Baring. A commander would certainly find conditions, no supplies and swarms of biting insects, unpleasant for delaying there. He would have three courses ojmn to him. 1. To attempt the Hamun. 2. To try and skirt it by the north. 3. To skirt it by the south. The possibilities of (1) have already been described. During the summer months (2) may almost bo put out of calculation. It involves a long and difficult detour of 120 miles through Afghan territory, to the Kliash Rud, with difficulties of marshes, unfordable rivers, and want of supplies. To uso this route Afghan opposition would have to be disposed of and on arrival at the Khash Rud, the Helmand would still have to be crossed. At this point the left bank of the Helmand com- mands and greatly favours defence. h T o. (3) appears the most probable course. From Baring it means a detour of about 70 miles, through country devoid of supplies and fodder, to the head of the Shilag. This river during part of normal summers is unfordable, and its high precipitous banks make it formidable in face of opposition. Having crossed here, another 40 miles of uninhabited country would bring the invaders to Varmal or Seh-Kuha, their objective. The defenders could prepare for their reception both at the Shilag, and along the gravel plain and ridges, between that river and Varmal or Seh-Kuha, where there are excellent natural posi tions for effective d ‘fence. a Guns would be a great encumbrance, and little use to the invader, till the last phase. Against shell fire the defenders could intrench themselves ; in this the Slstan labourer could give valuable assistance, for at digging they are very efficient.280 Boats. It is less difficult to invade Slstan from the south, owing to the absence of water difficulties, and because it can be approach ed simultaneously from two directions, the Kuh-i-Malik Siah and the Helmand valley. A force, driven southwards out of Slstan, would endeavour to hold a position on the left bank of the Helmand, near Kuhak, and keep open, for the force eomiri' to its assistance, that entrance to the country. From Zulfikar, the nearest Russian post, to the capital of Sistan is about 490 miles ; the shortest route there from Nushki via Kwaja ’All, is 365 miles. With regard to climate, water and supplies, the heat on the British routes in summer is very severe, while in winter the cold on the Russian route is intense. It is advisable to arrange beforehand to supplement local defi ciencies in water and supplies from the British side. The short est routes from Nushki are down the Helmand, and on all of them 49 to 56 miles have to be traversed without water on the road. This can be mitigated by bringing water from the Helmand. By marching at night this waterless stretch can be traversed durum the height of summer. Unless supplies were stocked at the various stages, the rapid movement of any force would bo seriously impeded. Supplies could be sent from Sistan up the Helmand valley. Fodder in normal years is very abundant in the valley itself. The people in the Helmand valley and Afghan Sistan are mostly Baluchis and Barechis, and are friendly, except under prohibition from Kabul. They would cordially assist with labour and supplies. They are a quite inoffensive people. For water carrying arrangements, leather pakhdls are unreliable. Very large-sized aluminium or other metal vessels are required, and every member of the force should have a canvas chdgal. On the Helmand, and especially in Sistan, boats are invalu able. The Helmand is navigable, even in winter, by boats of draught not exceeding 2 feet. A military force should be li berally supplied with Berthon boats, 8 to 12 feet or more in length, and also with light, strong pontoons of shallow draught for heavy carrying work. Picked boatmen should be brought. A largo supply of ropes is most necessary for water work. Cables 5and 3' for bridging, and 1' manilla for ferrying work. Very giupes are neef n (of timber or yiieiisefiilfor Sis most impolong ropes are necessary, owing to the width of the Hehnand and its branches. Long bamboo poles are required for working rafts (of timber or reeds). Light portable bridging material would be useful for the narrow deep canals and watercuts in Sistan. Light axes or Jcukris are most necessary for clearing jungle, Axes, and cutting tamarisk for bridging, etc. It is most important to bring a quantity of handmills for Handmills. grinding wheat; only a most inefficient a id limited number of mills are available in Sistan.CHAPTER VIII. Ports, Harbours and Islands. Ashuradi or Ashur, an island on the Caspian at the mouth of Astarabad Bay, is one of a group of three islands on which a o the barracks of a Russian garrison and the ; ead quarters of the East Caspian Squadron. The latter is composed of 3 or 4 small inefficient vessels of war, and a few steam launches, while the garrison consists of some 40 Cossacks and perhaps 100 infantry and marines. There is an excellent harbour to the south of the island, where ships drawing 8 or 10 feet of water can lie off 450 yards from the shore; here the sea is never sufficiently heavy to prevent landing. A pier, about 16 feet broad andnear- ly 350 feet long, enables boats to disembark troops or stores. The value to Russia of Ashurada consists in a measure in the fact that there is only 9 feet of water all along this coast; so under cover of the A aval Station here she can disembark troops and stores in Astarabad Bay. The spit of land, on which the cantonment is built, is said to be decreasing in size, and even now is so narrow that, during storms from the north, the spray sweeps over it. Steamers discharge at a hulk moored about a mile from Bandar-i-Gaz. Astarabad Bay is in the south-east corner of the Caspian, Astarab-m r™ and forms a most favourable roadstead. Towards its western ' “' end it becomes quite narrow and shallow. The shores to the east are low, marshy, and covered with reeds ; and to the south also low and clothed with thick forest. The bay is deepest at its eastern end opposite Ashurada (20 to 2£ feet), the islands of which afford the best landing places. The Gaz shore is un favourable, owing to the sticky mud of which the bottom is composed, and the shelving nature of the shore. Bandar-i-Ga7, the port of Astarabad Bay, consists of a few Bandar-i-Gaz. houses and a pier, 350 paces long and 8 feet wide, reported suit able for the landing of troops and guns; at its sea end there is sufficient water for boats drawing several feet. It would be very difficult for a force to march from here to Astarabad in the ( 283 )284 Mashad-i-Sar. Enzali. present state of the roads, for where there is no mud, there are forests, rice fields, and impassable hedges and thickets. A Russian Vice-Consul is located at Bandar-i-Gaz, as well as a Russian telegraph clerk. The Russian steamers of the Caucasus and Mercury Steam Navigation Company, from Baku via Krasnovodsk, call weekly. Since the opening of the Trans-Caspian Railway the port has lost some of its commer cial value, but it still retains a considerable amount of trade, and possesses a Persian Customs house. The channel is well buoyed by the Russian Government and ships of the largest size navigating the Caspian can enter in any weather by day or flight. The harbour is quite sheltered and can hold a large number of vessels. Mashad-i-Sar is a Caspian Sea port, 15 miles north of Barfurush at the mouth of the river Babul. It is a small badly built village with an open roadstead. There is no pier nor wharf, and no conveniences for loading or unloading cargo ; steamers lie out some distance from the Customs House, and passengers and cargo are transferred to large flat bottomed cargo bflats, of which about 40 are available. When the wind blows hard from the north, steamers have to anchor still further out to avoid the surf, and the sea invades the village. A bar has formed across the mouth of the river, but a harbour might bo made by dredging this. Considerable import and export trade with Russia is carried on through this port, and communication with Tehran is via Barfurush, and over the Elburz. Enzali is situated in the south-west corner of the Caspian, and stands on the westernmost of two long sand spits, which se parate the Murdab from the sea. On the opposite or easterly sand spit stands Gazian. These spits are nowhere of great breadth, but are always dry. The entrance to the Murdab is between the two spits, from 200 to 300 yards wide, and very difficult owing to a bar. In Enzali all the native population dwell, and hero there is a bazar. In Gazian there are two Cus toms Houses—import and export—wooden wharves, and two landing stages, alongside which steamers can load or discharge. Mail steamers touch here twice a week in summer ; and once a week in winter. They lie outside off the Customs House, pas sengers and goods being landed in steam launches. If the weather is very bad, steamers go on without attempting to put passengers ashore. lie i; an old fort tadfragons.

Gazian is more or less a Russian settlement, and contains a hotel, steamship offices and Russian trading houses. The Persians have done little to improve the place and what exists is due chiefly to Russian enterprise. The harbour of Enzali could be rendered accessible to mail steamers by dredging the bar. Ships drawing up to 7 or 8 feet of water can, in calm weather, enter and unload at the wharves. There are two routes from here to Rasht, one by land the other by water. The land route goes from Gazian, is practicable for carriages and has lately been put into order by a Russian engineer. The water route is as far as Pir-i-Bazar (a Russian owns some shallow draught steamers, which practically have the monopoly of this part of the route), whence a carriage road leads to Rasht. At Pir-i-Bazar there are a landing stage, wharf, ware houses, and a large caravanserai. The river from here to the Enzali Murdab has an average breadth of 25 yards and shelv ing banks, on which there is a growth of willows, rushes, &amp;c. Its depth is about 8', and the current sluggish. A towing path runs along the right bank from Pir-i-Bazar for about 3 miles, where firm ground ends, and a belt of rushes and weeds 1£—2 miles broad begins. The M urddb itself is some 30 miles by 10 in extent, and for the most part shallow ; the water is sweet. At Enzali there are over 1,000 boats of different sorts, large decked sailing boats, open boats, fishing boats, &amp;c. The Russians have been contemplating the necessary im provements hero for some years, and as far back as 1905, a steam dredger was imported, and a protective mole commenc ed, but progress is slow. Another improvement scheme exists for the cons'ruction of a landing place near the mouth of the Mubarakabad creek, alongside which steam launches could go, and tranship goods, &amp;c., into carts for Rasht, thus obviating journeys up either river. Astara is situated on both banks of the Astara river, which Astara. here forms the boundary between Russia and Persia. The river at this point is some 40 yards broad, and. on the Persian286 Persian Gulf. Huhamniareh. f^ide there are two ranges of store houses for the reception of merchandise, and a good natural quay, alongside which boats of 3 tons can lie. A bar of sand exists at the river mouth, the only entrance being by a narrow shallow passage on the north side. Vessels have to lie a couple of miles out at sea. Astara is merely a landing place and there is no buza,r nor market, goods being transported immediately inland to Ardabil and Tabriz. Except for a small Cossack guard, no Russians are settled on their side of the river. The climate is most un healthy. The length of the Persian Gulf from north-west to south-east is about 460 miles and its average breadth about 120 miles, excejat at its entrance, where the distance from Ras Masandam to the Persian Coast is only 29 miles. On the Persian side, the coast being mountainous, the water is deeper near the shore than on the Arabian shore, which is flat and low, with reefs and shoals extending out nearly its whole length. Even on the Persian side at most places vessels have to lie out some distance. On the shores of the Gulf supplies and fuel are scarce, water, except after the winter rains, is difficult to obtain and bad, and the climate P unhealthy. The temperature at the head of the Gulf is much lower than at the entrance. Roadstead .—The anchorage for small steamers is a ; ] mile from the landing place^ and cannot be used when the Karun is in flood (usually in March a id April, but sometimes earlier). Larger steamers, which cannot swing in the Haffar Canal, anchor near the left bank of the Shatt-al-Arab, between the entrance to the Haffar Canal and the west of Dibba Island. Here 27 could find moorings in single line, and above the entrance to the Karun would escape the eddies off its mouth and any sudden freshets, which cause whirlpools to form and swing vessels round. Coast .—The left bank of the Shatt-al-Arab is fairly steep but low, becoming more shelving in the Karun. The beach is mud with no clip's. ijitl andpositioi fitbjpng’ Allow dflirater spring ti ^4, tteiottom swim force theii jiraleexpenditun 'iiselsdrafingDS o § 1 -Here are loc jbM fit'll yessds Hi lire four of t siere more are si is em harbour imHawte.--] 'is for teavy town inj places for tr I of the Karun sifleBalimansbir ats are necessary t- iiif, ( Tides and currents .—The rise and fall of tide is 8' at spiring and 6' at neaps, but varies according to season and water in the river. Freshets in the Karim from February to June are dangerous. Troops and stores should not be landed during strong ebb tides. ^Customs 60 HfiOyiEntrance to harbour.—The bar at the entrance to the Shatt- al-Arab is passable for ocean steamers only at high water. The depth and position of the best channel over the bar is always changing. At low water about 13' only would be found but at high water spring tides, vessels drawing 21'G' have st rap ed through. The bottom consisst of very soft mud, and po, er- ful steamers can force their w ay through a foot or more of mud. At a moderate expenditure the bar could be dredged so as to admit vessels drawing 25 or 28 feet.- Pilots. There are local Arab pilots, but they are not fit to be entrusted with vessels of any size. The British India mail steamers have four of their own, whom they bring from Bushire, where more are said to be available. There are no harbour officials. Tugs and launches.—There are 5 of these, of which one is suitable for heavy towing. Landing 'places for troops can be found anywhere on either side of the Karun or Shatt-al-’Arab, from ' barges or launches. The Bahmanshlr might also be utilised. No special arrangements are necessary, except a supply of 30' planks, Boats .— Name. Capacity. Ballams Baghlehs Iron lighters ..

River steamers come nearly alongside at high water, and at other times load by gangways. There is no equipment for handling animals, no cranes, tram ways, or trollies, and no means of lighting by night. The town wharf is so close to the buildings on it that there is practically no space for landing stores. Storage facilities .—The Customs House is adapted for a base supply depot and offices. Messrs. Lynch have about 400 square yards of covered shed, and there are some mud buildings of the Standard Oil Company. The corn market is a walled-in space without roof 420' x 210', with a 12' verandah running round half the interior. There is ample wharfage area on the Customs and Lynch wharves, behind tho Consulate, and along the foreshore, A plentiful supply of tarpaulins for the protection of stores is essential. Convoy grounds are situated behind the date groves in rear of the Consulate, 600 yards from the river. The soil is alluvial, but there is no grazing. Drinking water is from the Karun only. A supply of pumps, piping and canvas troughs is necessary. Camping grounds .—There is ample ground on either side of the Karun above the Bahmashir Channel, and on the new canal one mile from the town. The neighbourhood of the town is insanitary. The ground, on both banks of the river, is liable to flood during March and April. The Shaikh of Muhammareh lives four miles further up the Shatt-al-’Arab, at Failleh, where he maintains an escort of 300 men armed with Martinis. The Shaikh is at present friendly and supreme here, and assist ance in the way of supplies, transport, &amp;c., would depend on political relations with him.

The boat does not travel at night, (2) The Nasmt (Mu’in-ut-Tujjar) a stern-wheeler paddle boat, put together in 1906, length 122', beam 20'(including sponsons), draught 3' 4' with 65 tons, which is her maximum cargo capacity, but varies according to the state of the river. She can tow two barges each holding 50 tons. Average time taken to Nasiri is 36 hours (with halts), and 14 hours re turning. She has two decks and poor accommodation for 4 first class and 200 deck passengers. The Captain is an Arab and the Engineer a British Indian. (3) The Blosse Lynch. (E. T. S. N”. Co.) occasionally plies on the Kariin, length 220', beam 29', draught unloaded 2' 9' with 100 tons 4', with 150 tons 4' 6'. The Khalifa and Mejidieh, two other boats of the same firm, plying between Basrah and Baghdad, would also probably be available for the Karun. The Oil Company too have a launch' 1 and barge. The Tigris-Euphrates Co. steamers to Baghdad would also probably be available. The Shaikh of Muhammareh owns two boats, the Iran and the Kdru&gt;?, somewhat similar to the Nasrat, each carrying 50 tons of cargo or about 50 passengers, but in bad repair and 'not likely to be available. He has also two small steam launches of little use for military purposes. The Customs and the British Consul have small launches. In 1910, the Shaikh had a new steam yacht built locally, of which only the engines, boilers and plates were brought from England. The following steamers work between Ahwaz and Shalllieh steamers on the on the Upper Karun. Upper Ka,ruu. 1. The Shushan (owned by the Persian Government and worked by the E. T. S. N. Co.) built in 1888, a stern wheeler, length 116', beam 18', draught 2' 6' to 3' with a cargo290 capacity of 20 to 30 tons. She tows a barge carrying 40 tons on a 3' draught, and takes a day and a half going up, and 12 hours coming down stream. 2. A twin screw vessel and two 40 ton barges, owned by the Mu’in-ut-Tujjar, built in 1907, commenced running in May 1908. Her dimensions are, length 80', beam 19', draught 2|' to 3', with a cargo capacity of about 20 tons according to the depth of the river. She carries 150 passengers and tows one barge, the other remaining at Ahwaz to be loaded. Above Band-i-Qlr, the river navigation during summer and autumn is very difficult. The lower Karun, for 6 months of the year, has everywhere quite 5' of water, and during the remaining 6 months, channels with a minimum depth of 4'. There should always be at least 4' of water under the steamer. For landing purposes at Muhammareh, it would probably be found best to send out material for putting together hat- bottomed barges, which, for use up the Karun, should not draw more than 3' loaded.

Khur Musa is a remarkable inlet of the sea, which leaves the Persian Gulf at its northern extremity to the east of the Shatt-al-’Arab, and affords easy access to Buzxeh and Ma’shur. The channel begins m the sea at a distance from land. The entrance is crossed by a bar, carrying only 3 fathoms at low water spring tides, but isj practicable for large vessels at high water. The bottom is mud and could easilyjbe dredged. Inside the bar the depth steadily increases, and from a point at a little over 11 miles from the entrance up to the head of the main Khur, there is no bottom throughout at 9 fathoms. The Khur Musa pro per is navigable for large vessels, and a branch called the Khur Qanaqeh, which takes off west at 29 miles, is navigable for a distance of 7 miles. The only difficulty arrises from the invi sibility of the edges of the channel except at low water. The principal anchorages are completely protected from all winds, and easily defended against attack from the open sea. Water is procurable from the Jarrahi river, and the climate is less trying than in some parts of the Gulf. or jetty. is sometim I il ptw jfMwl tbe nature He a an 80 bog kfW i trac: ^isconnec if,; lM *els throj ' iJiffi{Ie !ynsedfe iJ'Swi.a ■ T urnthe onTt is considered that it provides the best, if not indeed the only, defensible naval position on the Persian coast west of the Straits of Hormuz. A good road could probably bo made from Ram Hormuz on the Ahwaz-Behbehan route to Ma’shur, whence communications exist to JNTasirl (Ahwaz) and Muhammareh. The distance from Ram Hormuz to Ma’shur is 59J miles as against 72 to Ahwaz on the Karim. From Khur Bukhadir, the western branch of Khur Musa, a direct route to Muhammareh can apparently be followed across high land. Between Ma’shur and the anchorage at the mouth of Khur Dauraq, it seems likely that the construction of a permanent road would be difficult, though water carriage is certainly possible. . The country from Ma’shur to Ahwaz is reported as level plain ; m parts barren, in parts grassy, possibly swampy after ram but ordinarily good going. The Jarrahl at certain times and places is fordable and a ferry and plenty of boats are always available near Makhsar. The only real difficulty m the way of road construction is likely to occur in the immediate neighbourhood of the Khur, where mud appears to extend inland for some distance from the banks, necessitating an embankment or jetty, and probably corduroy roads. The creek to Bandar Ma’shur has banks of shelving mud and at low water holds 3' of water with a width of 15'. On high tides it is sometimes 50' wide and has a depth of 6' to s. The landing place for goods is over 2 miles from the village, and the connecting path difficult in bad weathen ^The nature of the banks prevents towing from tihur Musa, while a muddy alluvial plain extends on both sides of the creek, so boggy as to be impassable except by a few narrow fishermen’s tracks.

Native craft lie close to the beach in a creek, but landing is difficult owing to mud, and cargoes are loaded and unloaded by means of donkeys. There are routes along the coast past here from Bandar Big and Bushire. Roadstead .—The inner anchorage is If miles from the Customs House landing place in Khur Sultani. There is room for mooring 15 or 17 vessels of the British India type in 18 of water. The outer anchorage is 4 to 5 miles from the shore, and has room for a large number of steamers in 4 to 5 fathoms. No fixed moorings are provided. Both anchorages are exposed (the inner to a less degree); but the holding ground is good. Coast .—The coast is shelving, generally sandy, but rocky in places. Cliffs run from the south end of the town for f mile to the south. Thence no more cliffs occur till Rlshahr, 5-| miles south of Bushire. Tides and currents.—Tides do not run strongly enough to interfere with landing in boats, and there are no dangerous currents. Entrance to harbour—Th.e shoal water between the outer and inner anchorages forms a bar, and vessels drawing over IS' should wait for half tide. There is 11' water at low water springs, 17' at high water springs, and 16' at high water neaps. Pilots. There are 4 or 5 local pilots, but pilots are hardly required except in thick weather or with a bad sea on the bar. Tugs and launches.—Only the Persian Customs and Resi dency have launches. Dredging.—The port would be greatly improved by dredg- ing. Landing place for troops.—In addition to the usual landmg niaec at the Customs House, a landing can be effected almost anywhere on the beach to the south of the town. A convenient place at Bushire itself is abreast the town Residency, on a sandy and rocky beach. The most convenient place outside the town is a natural landing stage, below the Cable house at .Rlshahr point Boats can get alongside at any state of the tide, but landing here would be impossible if the south-east wind were blowing hard, as the surf then becomes dangerous. jR tie troops li jifj miles south i die, If there? jsutcouveiiientlai jaiiii embankment iiE alongside, Thi ijifaclend.

Wharf Coolies .—There are 1,000 to 1,500 Basktls who un load vessels, but during harvest times (spring and August—- September) they are scarce. Store depots .—Accommodation exists in covered godowns for a very considerable quantity of stores, along the side of the wharf, 10 to 50 yards from the landing place. Convoy grounds. —Plenty of space is available to the south of the town, about 500 to 1,000 yards from the store depots. There is no real grazing ground near; the water, though brackish, is fit for aninnals. Mules used on the road always camp some 10 miles out near Ahmadi, where there is grazing. Sanitation .—Arrangements are usually nil. In the 1856 war, 100 sweepers had to be requisitioned from India. Soil. —The soil everywhere is very sandy and would cut up. Wherever a landing was made, light tram lines would be advisable. Camping grounds. The best camping ground would be on the high ground in the neighbourhood of the Imdmzadeh, the294 Sabzabad Residency, and Rlshahr. This position commands the whole town and approaches. Water is said to be plentiful, and the best obtainable in the peninsula. The site is the most healthy in the neighbourhood. [See pages 24 and 25.] Telegraph .—The Indo-European Cable leaves the water at Rishahr, where there is a staff of some 15 European and Eura sian operators. Water .—All water in Bushire city is so brackish and bad, that it is advisable, if the health of the troops is to be maintained, that condensing apparatus should be supplied. Pumps, cisterns and troughs would also be necessary. See camping grounds above. For supplies see page 199. Inhabitants .—The population is about 15,000, mixed but Persians predominate. Their well-bred manners conceal an unreliable and ungrateful disposition, and they are inclined to be incivil to foreigners, though less so now than formerly. The inhabitants of the hinterland are truculent and tolerably warlike, well supplied with modern rifles and ammunition. It is estimated that several thousand armed men could be collected within a radius of 50 miles. Garrison .—See Chapter V. All Gulf ports are furnished with detachments from this garrison, so only about 300 infantry and 36 artillerymen remain. There are in the neighbourhood, 45 infantry and 8 artil lerymen with a gun at Khurmuj, and 80 infantry and 4 artil lerymen at Ahram, also with a gun, a breech loader. Irregulars .—The inhabitants of the town and peninsula possess a good many Martinis, with 50—80 rounds per rifle. They are not a fighting class, numbering at the outside 1,000* with no horses, and have practically no military value. Sea defences.—There are none properly so called. The Persepolis has 4 guns and 40 soldiers armed with Martinis. The Customs steamer has 4 guns and about 15 soldiers, and another steam launch has one machine gun. Land defences .—The town lies at the northern end of the peninsula, 14 miles long by about 4 to 5 broad, and is con nected with the main-land by a broad track leading across the295 Masbileh or swamp on the east side. It is easily defensible from the land side, as the track from the interior across the Mashileh is commanded by a ridge', rising 100 feet above the road level. There are no modern forts, but at Rishahr there is a deserted redan. The town of Bushire has on the land side a wall, 30' high and 5' to 6' thick, pierced for musketry. Guns are as follows :— 14 obsolete muzzle-loading guns, only 6 on carriages. 4 small breech-loading guns on carriages. 2 20-centimetre continental guns on carriages. 2 howitzers. The last 4 are modern guns and are placed in front of Government House. The Governor is supposed to have /00 rounds for them, partly shrapnel and partly common shell, and 40 cases of gun powder. They command the creek and landing place. The Mashileh, especially when dry, for 15 miles is most excellent ground for cavalry, who can also work well up to the bases of the hills. The Mashileh, however, be comes very deep and sticky after rain. About 15 miles from Bushire, a long ridge passing through Gurak offers a position facing south-west, to a force advancing on Bushire from the east or south-east. It com mands the whole of the lowlying ground towards Bushire, and has a mean elevation of about 300' above the level of the plain. It would also afford a position facing north-east, to a force covering Bushire against an enemy advancing from the east, though its extent would require a considerable body of troops to hold it. Tahirl is one of the Shibkuh ports, approximately half Taliiri. way between Bushire and Lingeh. It is in a small open bay, formed by two low points 2 miles apart and covered with date groves. The village is built partly on the shore and partly up the side of the coast range, here 700' high. It contains 150 stone houses, inhabited chiefly by Arabs with some Per sian Shi’ahs. Water is obtained from wells 3 fathoms deep. A few horses, donkeys, cattle (500) and sheep (100) are the only livestock reported here, but more are said to be in laud,296 Chiru. Lingeh. The importance of Tahiri lies in the fact that vessels can be brought quite close in-shore, mstead of, as is usually the case in the Gulf, having to lie a long way out. The bay deepens regularly from the coast to 8 fathoms at £ mile off shore. The only routes into the interior are by two passes, by blocking which an enemy could be confined to the narrow strip along the sea coast. The hinterland is sparsely populated and little known, and thus the place would appear admirably adapted for smuggling operations. The inhabitants own about six trading sambuqs. Chiru is on the mainland, opposite HindarabI island, in a small bay, which is easy of access and forms a good anchorage in a shamdl, but is exposed to easterly and south-easterly winds. The shore is flat and sandy, and the water deep close to the beach, with little or no tidal stream. Inland from the village steep hills arise, the drainage from which is caught in 5 reservoirs. The inhabitants are Sunni Arabs and possess about 200 houses, five trading vessels and about a dozen fishing boats. In conjunction with Hindarabi island, the place might be suitable as a small naval station. Roadstead. —Ships at Lingeh usually anchor to f mile from the landing place, and are able to do so in all weathers. There is room for a great number of vessels, but no fixed moor ings are provided. Coast. —The coast is shelving, and the beach sandy. All ground near is lowlying and sandy, with a gentle rise inland. Tides and currents. —Tides do not run strongly enough to interfere with landing from small boats, and there are no dangerous currents. Pilots. —No pilots are required, since there is no bar. Launches. —One of the customs launches is generally stationed here, but no other steamers of any kind. Five fathoms line is half to three quarters of a mile from shore. Landing peaces for troops. —If inexpedient to land troops opposite the town, they could utilise any point 5 miles to the west or 10 miles to the east.

Normally the surf is negligible, but when a south-east gale is blowing it is dangerous to land from small boats. Native boats.—Somo 20 or 30, of 25 to 35 tons, and num bers of smaller craft, are always available. In non-pearling seasons 50 to 68 boats are left drawn up on the beach. Landing facilities .—There is no proper wharf, but the outer wall of a small boat harbour, formed by stone break waters, 80 yards long, can be used as a wharf, alongside which large baghlehs can come at high tide. Another convenient land ing place is formed by a flat rock, at a point a little to the east by the new Customs House. A large amount of timber is always available for constructing temporary landing places. Horses, camels, etc., are usually left in boats as close in-shore as possible at high tide, so that at low water they can walk ashore. Landing appliances.—No steam engines, winches, trol lies, carts, hawsers, cables, etc., are available. Wharf and lightermen.—In the cool season about 200 coolies are employed, but in the hot season labour is very scarce. Store Depots .—There are a number of godowns, 20 to 50 yards from the landing place. These are not always in good repair, and tarpaulins are necessary. Convoy grounds.—A large open space J mile from the store gociowns is suitable, with large hirlcehs (tanks) from which, in normal years, ^ ample water is available; there is no graz ing in the vicinity. After good rain, camels bring in grass from places 3 to 9 miles distant. . Sanitation .—There is no scavenger class. Mosquito cur tains are a necessity at certain seasons. The climate is reputed the best of any port in the Gulf. Rain usually falls from November to February. Telegrams .—Telegrams are forwarded to and from Han jam by boat. Water .—All sweet water is obtained from large birkehs dependent on rainfall, The well water is indifferent. With the298 addition of pipes, a much larger area could be made available for water-supply. Except in the case of a very small force landed soon after a heavy rainfall, distilling plant would be advisable. The Camping ground for troops is J mile east of the land ing place, just outside the town. This site has an area of about 4 square miles, and on it are the drinking water birkehs. The ground is hard sand, but in wot weather becomes rather a quag mire. Irregulars. —The local tribes until recently possessed few rifles and very little ammunition; but modern arms and am munition have of late been imported into this district by gun runners. The natives are not warlike, nor fit to be trained as soldiers. Sea defences. —There are no sea defences, nor garrison, nor any good position, which could be held to oppose a landing under the fire of a gun boat. Land defences .—Lingeh is situated in the open. The country round rises, gradually, by a bare stony incline, for some 3 miles. At the summit of the rise, a precipitous escarp ment is reached, which drops to a salt plain 50' below, and about a mile broad. This again drops 30' to 40' to another plain, which stretches for some miles north-west of the town. On the north-east, the mountains gradually close in, and reach the coast line some 5 miles east of Lingeh. A few guns, placed on the ridge, -would command the whole country to the north and west. Owing to the formation of the country, there are only three approaches to Lingeh from the north and west. A fourth road leads along the back of the moun tains and eventually comes in from the east, joining the main road from that quarter. Any force marching by either this or the sea coast road would be exposed to shell fire from ships in the harbour. During the threatened raid on Lingeh in 1910, the fight ing force of the town proved to be 70 tufangchis, and 200 men under the Shaikh of the Arab quarter. Ten masonry towers were built. These as a whole were placed in good positions, and six of them were taken over as piquet posts by the British naval force that landed. tyidk-Tlus al it tabs and Persia) jijflcentoftliefig! jiie seldom prodm I aM-SMps at smcW miles froi Am, 2|niiles out iippacli and anch d t*! sand and rke is considerable Mile vicinity i irifcoftlieS-fatho] :antic landing mi for a large nun a !

Only 1 per cent, of the fighting men are supposed to have arms, which are seldom produced except under the incitement of mullds. Roadsteads. —Ships at Bandar ’Abbas drawing up to 17 Bandar Abbas, feet can anchor 2 miles from the beach. There is an anchorage at 4 fathoms, 2-| miles out, for 2 miles each side of the town. Ships approach and anchor on the lead. Holding ground is good, being sand and mud. During a strong south-east wind, there is considerable surf on the beach. Steamers usual ly anchor in the vicinity of a buoy, about 2 miles from shore on the edge of the 3-fathom line. Gunboats could anchor a mile from the landing place opposite the town. There is anchorage for a large number of ships, which never becomes dangerous. No fixed moorings are provided. Coast is very gently shelving sand ; hence the distance of the anchorage. The beach is of sand and mud, and very soft, without cliffs. At low tide the shore is so flat that small boats take the ground 100 yards from the water’s edge. Tides and currents are not strong enough to interfere with boats or landing. During rough weather, rollers or surf are liable to broach a boat to, or capsize it. If landing 3 miles west of the town, caution is necessary as the tidal streams of Clarence Straights set up strong currents. The fore-shore dries up, at spring tides, for 200 yards opposite the town, and 400 yards opposite the new Consulate. Opposite Naiband the distance is greater, probably 600 to 800 yards. Pilots. —None are needed. Launches. —The customs have two launches, one 85' long, drawing 6', and new in 1908. The concessionaire of Hormuz Island has one launch, and His Majesty’s Consul expects one immediately (1911). Dredging. —The locality is not adapted for dredging, unless undertaken on a large scale in connection with harbour works. Landing place for troops. —The best point would be opposite the Consulate at Naiband. The coast is very shelving, but the beach hard and firm below H. W. mark. Above is a ridge of soft sand 10' high, and beyond a plain of loose sand, very difficult for carts or even men or mules. The nearest camp*300 ing ground is 400 yards distant in a palm grove, 200 yards south-west of the Consulate. Landing could be effected at any point up to 3 miles west of the town, or 9 to 10 miles east, but it would be through surf in small boats, and the troops would have to wade a long distance at low water. The surf is only dangerous with a strong gale, bad weather seldom lasts more than 2 days at a time. Advantage should be taken of high water to land stores. There is no estuary in the vicinity which could be used. Boats. —There are 5 or 6 rowing boats (capacity 10 to 15 men), and some 20 bagUehs of from 20 to 35 ton burthen, cap able of carrying 30 to 50 men or 20 tons of stores ; these draw 6' to 8', and are only useful for landing at the customs pier. Probably the best way of unloading artillery and vagons from these larger boats would be to beach them at high tide; even then it would bo difficult. Temporary landing stages would be difficult to construct owing to— (1) Absence of local materials ; (2) immense length required; (3) difficulty of finding a stable foundation ; (4) liability to damage during bad weather. Light tramways, owing to the flatness of the country, would be easily constructed and be very useful. Facilities for landing. —Practically none. There are no wharves. The pier, in the centre of the town, extends about 100 yards into the sea from high water mark. At low water, it is high and dry. Being in a very dilapidated condition, it would not bear the weight of heavy guns, and is very badly lighted at night. Goods are landed in lighters, which come alongside the pier when the tide is high enough. Landing appliances. —Nil. Wharf and lightermen .—In the cold season 200 to 300 coolies are procurable ; in the hot season not more than 100. Store depots. —The customs warehouses and other private godowns are situated in the vicinity of the pier.

Tramways would be difficult to lay in the town, owing to the narrowness of the roads and lanes. Convoy grounds. —There is ample open space to the east, and is- mile to the north-east of the customs pier, outside the town. Brackish water is obtainable by sinking wells, but good drinking water is only to bo had at Nalband, 2| miles dis tant. Grazing is not procurable anywhere near. ~ Telegraph .—A cable and land line connects with the Indo- European station at Han jam Island. Offices are established at the Consulate and in the town. Language. —Bastard Persian is spoken by the inhabitants. A number of Hindus speak Persian and Hindustani and could be utilised as interpreters. Water is distant, not abundant, and either brackish or im pure. The best for drinking is obtained from the shallow wells at Naiband. If a force of 2,000 men were landed, a base depot would have to be maintained here, however rapidly the force moved into the interior, so a condensing ship, or plant ashore would be a necessity. Camping ground. —Large open spaces sandy, well drained, audflat, exist all around Naiband and close to the water- supply. The town of Bandar ’Abbas stands at the foot of the bay and is about 1 mile long andmile deep, the buildings ap proaching within 100 yards of the water. Behind it, at a distance of 18 miles north by west, is the Kuh-i-Ginau (7,783'). • Tho immediate surroundings are bare sandy desert, and the country so open, for a distance of two miles, that it would afford no facilities in the way of cover to an enemy attacking from the land side. There are no land nor sea defences. Inhabitants. —In the cold weather the population numbers about 10,000, in summer it is very much less. The inhabitants are a hybrid race of mixed Persian, Baluchi, Arab, and Negro descent, and are known as “ ’Abbasis.” They are a poor- spirited race. The local tribes and villagers are only partly302 armed, and their value as soldiers may be regarded as negli gible. Their arms are chiefly rusty, ill kept Sniders and Martinis, with, at the outside, 200 rounds per rifle. They are very bad shots and have no leaders. ';hei iiil Mows the e; -*1 closer, but the : |ere is a s M'in r, b Khur is a saltwater creek 33 miles east by south of Bandar ’Abbas. The bar is nearly dry at low water. It is an indifferent harbour, but native boats not exceeding 20 tons can use it, entering at high water. Roadstead .—There arc two anchorages at Jask, east and west, respectively,-of the promontory on which stands the tele graph station. Large ships usually anchor in the west bay, 11 miles from shore, as the landing in small boats is more conveni ent there. During a strong “ shamll ” (which generally blows from the west at Jask), they anchor in the east bay, mile from shore and 1 mile from the telegraph station, as landing in the west bay then becomes dangerous. Coast .—The promontory is lowlying, and the beach sandy and shelving. Low cliffs only exist in places. Tidesani currents .—Tides never run strongly enough to interfere with landing in boats. The rise and fall is 9' and there are no dangerous currents. Capacity .—There is room for a large number of transports of the British India type ; but no fixed moorings. Pilots are not needed, but there are shoals in the ap proach to the western anchorage. Landing place for troops .—Troops could bo landed in fine weather anywhere along the open sandy beach, which forms the foreshore. Transports of the British India type could come within one to two miles from the telegraph station. Land- ins in the west bay would be dangerous with strong north-west to south-west winds, owing to the surf; so much so, that a strong swell may even set round the point into the east Lay. These winds are generally strongest in the afternoon, and com mon from October to March. it! out of boats. iffjfiwtt-Kil. kinpok-An old 5MiI21arge rooi plins;itis 50 yi ^ Wings contain 'M8(32'x8'),andi $I0 ywIs from the SMunodation: aiJimfe-Ther s w scarce, %k~-This is an ®iffl of the Indo ^iacomnmnicat awl-east of the ‘'ferdofthecab ;:Sw ble eaters the ^H andan A W-The inhat ,!®«or Baliich308 head of the promontory ; here the beach is sandy and shelving. When the shamdl blows the east bay is used ; here the transports can approach closer, but the beach is steeper and not so con venient. There is a small creek, 3 miles north of the station, which can only be entered by small boats at high water. Landing facilities .—There are no wharves, and no material for their construction* Apart from the small quantities of stores occasionally landed for the use of the telegraph station, very little merchandise is landed. Cattle, horses, and camels, wade ashore out of boats. Landing appliances. —Nil. Wharf and LijMermen .—About a dozen coolies could bo found. Store depots .—An old ruined Persian fort contains 24 small rooms and 2 large rooms, and would be useful if roofed in with tarpaulins; it is 50 yards from the landing place. The telegraph buildings contain 18 large rooms (32'xl5 / ), and 6 smaller rooms (32' x S'), and are situated 250 yards from the shore and some 400 yards from the landing place. The sepoys’ bar racks have accommodation for 100 men and two Indian officers. Convoy grounds .—There is suitable ground just east of the telegraph station, but grazing is not procurable for many miles. Water is very scarce. Telegraph .—This is an important station on the Persian Gulf Section of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, and is also in communication with Masqat- The cable leaves the shore south-east of the buildings, and vessels should never anchor westward of the cable. A small beacon denotes the point where the cable enters the sea. The staff consists of 10 or 12 European clerks, and an Assistant Surgeon. There is a tem porary British wireless installation at Jask. Language .—The inhabitants of this place and district speak either Persian or Baluchi. Some telegraph servants would probably be capable of acting as interpreters. Water is procurable, in small quantities and slightly brack ish, from wells outside the telegraph compound. There are 3 tanks inside the compound, in which rain water is caught for the use of the staff. To obtain an adequate supply a con densing ship or plant ashore would be necessary.Camping grounds .—There are 30 acres or more of ground east of the telegraph station. The soil is hard except after rain; there are no roads, and the water is brackish and scanty. Inhabitants. —The Persian village consists of 45 mud huts, and is inhabited by a mixed population of Baluchis and others including 8'dis. They are mostly Sunnis and fishermen by occupation. The only Persian officials belong to the Customs Department. An undisciplined rabble, about 500 strong and armed with Martini rifles and 10,000 cartridges and the usual knives, could possibly be got together from the neighbourhood, but their military value would be extremely small. Land defences .—Jask telegraph station has been placed in a proper state of defence. The old Persian fort is situated on the flank of the line of advance of an enemy attacking from the land side. During a threatened Aighan attack ha April 1908, this fort was occupied by a naval force and a gun. A trench was run across the promontory about 250 yards in advance of the telegraph station, and manned by the Indian infantry guard. Gun-boats in the west and east bays can command with their fire any advance against this position. The slope of the shore on the eastern side of the promon-' tory would afford cover, from the westward, to a small force advancing along the beach with the intention of enfilading the defences ; but it would come under fire were a gun-boat sta tioned in the eastern anchorage. Climate resembles that of Bandar ’Abbas, but the tem perature is always lower. _ Extremes of heat and cold are common, and in summer the moist atmosphere renders the heat very trying. Sandstorms are frequent, and malarial fever prevalent in the cold weather. The normal rainfall is about 4} inches. Galag is a small, dirty village of about 15 fishermen’s huts, on the east side of the eastern branch of the delta of the Rapch river, about 700 yards from the river mouth. Roadstead is open, and about 3 miles from shore, where the anchorage, in 7 fathoms, has good holding grounds. Boats, there are 5 boats of 20 tons employed in trade with Masqat, Qishm and other places. It is reported that o wing to the bar silting up, boats have now some difficulty in entering.305 Landing places. —A good landing place is situated just inside the entrance of the river to the east side, on to a steep beach. Men can land dryshod. Ships’ boats can enter in fine weather at half tide. If there is too much sea to enter, then the best landing place is about 1-|-miles east of the creek. During a heavy swell, landing would be difficult. Water is good from shallow wells. There is a small date grove near the village, and the in habitants should be able to supply fish, but there is little else except a few livestock. Roadstead. —The anchorage at Chahbar is exposed to the Chahbar. monsoon, and dangerous during that season. A large number of ships, drawing up to 20', could anchor in calm weather about 2 miles from the beach. Good shelter from the mon soon exists to the north of Ras Kulab, where there is deep water. The distance round the bay by land to ChahMr is 28 miles. Coast .—The coast, south of the promontory on which Chahbar is situated, is rocky and consists of cliffs 10' to 50' high. North of the promontory is a sandy beach, varying in breadth from 10 yards at the point to 200 yards opposite the village. The water north of the promontory is shallow, except for a distance of 800 yards opposite the village, where boats drawing 5' can approach to within 20 yards of shore, even at low tide. Tides and currents. —No currents exist. The rise and fall of the tide is about 9'. Rilots are not required. Boats .—About 20 boats, carrying 20 men each, are available here and at Tiz ; also 20 canoes capable of carrying 4 to 6 men. There are about 20 baghlehs drawing 7' to 9', capable of carry ing 100 men each. Landing troops, etc., by boats .—For this only the 800 yards of beach opposite the village is available. No facilities exist, but stone can be quarried, about 800 yards west of the tele graph buildings, suitable for the construction of land m 2 stacrfts * ™Labour .—About 400 unskilled labourers could be collected locally, mostly from British Baluchistan. Camping and convoy grounds are capacious and well situat ed on high level ground. Climate is fairly cool and healthy, except during June and July. Heavy rain usually falls from December to February. Telegraphs .—A land line runs to Karachi and to Jask, and a telephone to Gwatar and to Jask. Language .—Baluchi (Makran dialect) is the language spok en about here ; Hindustani is generally understood, but Persian is rarely used or understood. Water .—There are 3 wells in a garden, situated \ mile from the telegraph station, which give a supply of excellent water. They are soon exhausted, but rapidly refill, and their capacity should meet the requirements of a battalion. The water is pumped into a reservoir and pipes lead to the telegraph quarters. The remaining wells in Chahbar are brackish, and the supply barely suffices for the village. General .—There are no tugs, launches, skilled labourers nor European firms, and no defences nor local forces. The toivn lies round a ruined fort, standing 300 yards from the shore at the head of a small bay. Close to the south are gardens, with a few fruit trees and date palms, extending for | mile inland in a valley lying inside the coast hills. At a short distance to the north-east of the fort is a large white tomb, the dome of which is a landmark at sea. Population is mixed and totals about 2,300, chiefly Baluchis with a few Negroes {Sidis) and others. - Tlz is practically the same as Chahbar. It is situated at the opening of a valley, north of the tableland and hills separate it from that place, and may, under certain circumstances, be considered a more convenient landing place and base. It is only about 3| miles to the north of Chahbar, and information for the two places is identical, except the following:— Roadstead .—In calm weather a large number of ships could anchor in 6 fathoms about 2 miles from Tiz beach.Coast .—Between Chahbar and TIz point, the tableland terminates in cliffs about 150' high, which slope down to a sandy beach, backed by a valley north of the point. Landing by boats.~T1 \xq beach only is available, for landing troops and equipment. It is f mile long and 200 yards wide No facilities exist, but stone for constructing wharves, etc., is obtainable close by, though timber is scarce. Water is sweet and abundant from 3 wells in the bed of the Nfunkhani Nullah. Other wells could be sunk. Gwatar is about equally divided between Persian and n British territory. The village and the mouth of the river Dash- ' tian ‘01111 are in Persia. There is no harbour, and, the road stead is shallow, exposed, and unsuitable for large vessels. The inhabitants belong to the Maid tribe, number about 1 000 and are all fishermen. The Customs Department have an official here. Islands. 0 , J^badan is a large and valuable island in the mouth of the ’Abbadau. Shatt-al-Arab It is about 40 miles long and its width vanes froin miles at the centre to 12 miles at the southern end. Ihe interior is mostly desert, but. the margins bv the rivers and creeks are cultivated, and have date plantations. total population is reported at about 24,000, mostly Ka’ b Arabs. The island belongs to the Muhammareh district. In 1856 the Persians erected five batteries on the north side of this island, o prevent the British passmg up the river. The Turkish port tkS+f ° Pp0SitC the isIand on the r ^t bank of tbe bhatt-al- Arab. It comprises a cable station, landing iettv aiid garnson of Turkish troops. The Milage contains some 400 inhabitants ; the fort is of stone with no modern defences. mOes ° f KMrij (° rKh ^g) island is 34 Kharij or ff l7i n0 i th 7 e f T 0 BQsIlire ’ ancl2 i miles north of it begins Ehara g- Ibou^ ' r i 1Sl t nd °i Kh ? rgiL • Kh ' rijis 0Ver 4 nriles long g by hills th t a i br °f d ’ a : nd C0nsists chiefly of barren table -topped til s the highest point being 284'.

The remains of a Dutch fort exist near the village. The island is surrounded by a reef £ a mile broad : the best anchorages and landing places are off the village, but they are exposed, and the holding ground is rocky and indifferent. The climate has always been deemed very salubrious,and the water good. Under the Dutch occupation, it throve in commerce and increased in population to over 12,000 souls. Twice it was in the hands of the French. In 1838, an Anglo-Indian force occupied it, and in 1856-57, it was again taken by the British, and principally used for hospital purposes. Shaikh Shu’aib. The island of Shaikh Shu’aib, or ’Abu Shu’aib, subtends the coast of the Shibkuh ports, its nearest point being 5 miles from the mainland. In extent it is about 15 miles by 3 miles, rises to a height of 120' in the centre and has a low plain at either extremity ; the greater part is nearly destitute of vegetation. The coast consists chiefly of low cliffs w r ith sandy points and bights ; the anchorages are sheltered from one direction only. There are 10 small villages, with a total population of about 1,500, all Sunni Arabs, principally engaged in fishing and pearl diving. They possess about 40 modern rifles. Hindarabi. The eastern extremity of Hindarabi island is about 4| miles west-north-west of Chlru. The island is over 4 miles long by nearly 3 miles broad and rises gradually to a flat centre 100' high, devoid of vegetation except a little grass in the spring. The village is situated about the middle of the north shore, and contains about 100 houses of Sunni Arabs, mostly fishermen and pearl-divers, owning 15 to 20 small craft; about a quarter of the men have modern rifles. There are a few cattle and goats, date palms, banyan trees and some wheat and barley cultivation. The water from wells is brackish in summer. The harbour is safe, commodious, and sheltered from a north-west wind. Reefs round the island impede landing at low water, and in the straits render navigation difficult. Q&amp;is. Qais island was in former times of great importance. It is 11 miles off the Shibkuh coast, and divided from the mainland by a fine channel 20 to 30 fathoms deep. In area it is about and rises .g He shores ai gimstwardandwO' jsyassedbyareef, outside.

The shores are low and the beach sandy with rocky points ; eastward and westward it ends in low cliffs. The island is encompassed by a reef, nowhere more than a mile broad, with deepwater outside. It is bare of vegetation, except a few date groves. Sweet water is obtained by digging from 1 to 4 feet. There are 11 small villages, and the total population is estimated at 2,250 Arabs, possessing perhaps a score of modern rifles. They cultivate dates, melons, vegetables, wheat and barley, but are principally engaged in fishing and pearling, possessing some 20 large boats and 67 small ones. About 20 Hindu merchants are settled here. There are extensive and interesting Muham madan ruins on the island. It was occupied as a British military station for a time, after the operations against the Gulf pirates. The largest and most important island in the Gulf is Qishm. Qishm. It subtends the Persian Coast from Lingeh almost to Bandar ’Abbas. The islands of Larak and Hanjam are appendages of it. The extreme length of Qishm is 68 miles with a breadth averaging 10 miles. The island is almost covered with table- topped hills, without any dominant peaks, though Kishkuh, the highest summit, nearly in the middle of the island and a oout 17 miles from Basidu, reaches 1,300 / . Qishm is, apart from the villages, almost a desert, but the hills contain some animal life. The coast is rocky. The island contains hills composed a:most entirely of excellent rock salt, which is exported in large quantities. The total population amounts to about 13,500 souls, nearly all Arabs by race and Sunnis by religion. A severe earthquake, in 1898, destroyed a number of the people. Arabic is the langu age of the island. Qishm is held in farm by the Mu’In-ut-Tujjar of Tehran, whose authority locally is concurrent with a general political control by the governor of the Gulf Ports. The authority of the Deputy-Governor of Bandar ’Abbas is not respected. The Shaikh of Qishm, an Arab, is the local chief for general administration and resides at Qishm town. The Central Gov ern- menfc of Persia is only represented by a few customs officials. It is estimated that there are 279 native craft belonging to Qislim the island. There are 33 villages on the island of which Qishm town at the eastern extremity is the chief. The town standsBasidu. on a level sandy site, close to the sea and a date plantation. There are seven domed water reservoirs, but only one well (about a mile from the fort), which furnishes good water; this supply is generally sufficient for the population. An old Portuguese fort now stands in a ruined state. The climate is cooler than at Bandar ’Abbas. Thepopulationmay amount to 3,000, chiefly Arabs, with 100 families of Persians. These are mostly engaged in fishing, trade, boat-building and weaving lungls. The shipping is considerable, but there is no harbour, and off the town there are reefs. Vessels of large or moderate' size must anchor a mile or more out. Basidu is a British station on the westernmost point of Qishm island ; an Arab village of the same name stands about 1 mile to the east. Basidu point is a low cliff rising 20' above H. W.; the top is level, with a few date trees, and open to every wind. The station was practically unoccupied for some years, but in 1910 was reopened as a coaling station, in connection with the suppression of the arms traffic. The former officers ’quarters hospital, sepoy lines, lazdr, and store houses had fallen into disrepair. Accommodation has now been provided for some half dozen Europeans, and a dozen native employes. A good stone pier leads to the coal wharf. There is a bungalow, near the flagstaff, J mile south of the point, a rest house, forge, wifeless station, (the two latter adjoin one another), and three reservoirs in good repair. Four miles east of Basidu, at Nakhlistan, there are some good wells and a palm grove. A rifle range, up to 600 yards, still exists. There never were any permanent defences, but in 1910, a guard of ono non commissioned officer and six men of the Indian Army were sent there. The population, before the station was reopened in 1910, was some 50 souls. The shamdl cools the place in the summer! There are some Portuguese rums close by. The Arab village of 200 huts is included within British jurisdiction. The village possesses 8 reservoirs, and about 25 donkeys, 50 cattle, and 400 sheep and goats. The anchorage here extends parallel to the shore on the north side of the point, and consists of a bolt J mile broad, at i mile from shore. The depth is 5 to 7 fathoms, and the clay bottom forms good holding ground. Landing is inconvenient in a swell, owing to the rocky nature of the coast, and a mud flat uncovered at low water. |iu considerable .iiorth coast of t at.

It is built at the foot of a hill 200' high, and the ap proach is by a narrow creek in which native craft lie. The village consists of 250 houses of Arabs and Persians, engaged in fishing, boatbuilding, and cutting firewood from the adjacent swamps! The water-supply, from roofed tanks and wells, is slightly brackish, and the livestock consists of a few cattle, sheep, and goats. The hill behind Laft is scarped, and the scarps strength ened at their crests with curtains and flanking works. These, with a dilapidated fort, having five circular towers pierced for guns, appear to be traces of a former European occupation. Laft point provides good sheltered anchorage in deep water close to the shore, but tidal streams are strong and the climate excessively hot in summer. Hanjam island, sometimes called the “ Perim of the Persian Hanjam. Gulf ” is situated off the south coast of Qishm, and divided from it by a strait, 1 mile nude and 6 to 12 fathoms deep. It would form a good base of naval observation, the Gulf here being so narrow that the Arabian coast is visible on a clear day. It is not, however, altogether a suitable site for a defended naval establishment. The island is an agglomeration of rugged hills (the highest 350'), decreasing in elevation towards the south end. It is a dismal mass of barren, broken and almost black rock. The heat in summer is barely tolerable, and is aggra vated in June, July and August by sandflies and the stench of decaying sea weed. The rainy season is from October to March; the fall varies considerably. Only three points are inhabited ; of these, the British telegraph station for the submarine cable (also connected with ( Bandar ’Abbas) is on a cliff near the north coast The village of Hanjam at the south east side has 200 houses of Arabs from the Arabian coast, who are described as intelligent, industrious and hospitable. These people are engaged in date and other cultivation, and fishing and pearling for which they have 36 boats ; they own a few donkeys, cattle and goats. In summer the village is practically deserted. The third settlement is Ghail, with about 30 houses, 3 miles south-west of the telegraph station. There is an almost inexhaustible well here of excellent water, close by the beach, and a valuable anchorage, sheltered from the shamal, between Hanjam and Qishm. This was formerly312 Hormuz. Larak. a rendezvous for pirate craft, and occasionally slave s, and is now much visited by native craft to take in water. The anchorage lies on both sides of a sandy spit at the most northern point of the island, on which a beacon has been erected by the cable ship of the Telegraph Department. The bottom is hard, and holding therefore bad, especially as the ebb tides run very strongly. The depth is about 9 fathoms. The principal authority here is the Arab Shaikh; two fagstaffs and a customs post are the only signs of Persian sovereignty. No tribute nor revenue is paid. There are ruins of mosques and many other fine buildings on the island. The north point of Hormuz, the site of the celebrated an cient city, is 11 miles east-south-east of Bandar ’Abbas, and 4 miles south of the nearest part of the main land. The passage between is navigable for vessels of moderate draught about its centre. Except at the northern and southern extremities, the island has a broad belt of shoal water. The hills average over 300' in height and one peak reaches 690'. All ravines and valleys in the interior are incrusted with salt, and the whole surface is almost entirely barren. Copper, specular iron ore, red oxide of iron, and salt exist on the island, but only the last two are worked. The quantity of sweet water available from reser voir is strictly limited ; practically nothing else is obtainable. The only inhabited place is the village situated on the neck of the northern promontory, between the Portuguese port at its extremity, and the ruins of the ancient city landward. The population, while the mines are being worked, may amount to 1,200 souls, but in summer more than half migrate, chiefly to Minab. They are mostly Persians from Bashakard and Pud- bar ; but there are also Baluchis and Arabs who are largely employed as sailors, fishermen and miners, and own some 15 boats of different kinds. The anchorage is a mile to the east of the old fort, in 4 to 5 fathoms. A few reservoirs to store rain water exist, as well as some slightly brackish wells. The Portuguese fort is very dilapidated, but contains two magni- ficient reservoirs now empty, but in good repair. Larak island, 20 miles south by east of Bandar ’Abbas, is surrounded by deep water, except on the west side. The interior is a mass of rugged hills, two summits being just over 500' high, vegetation is entirely lacking, and sweet water is only found in the Salmi well, or perhaps in reservoirs.

Clarence strait, between Qishra and the mainland, and 1 to Ciarencj strait. 15 miles in width, is navigable for large vessels ; but a pilot is indispensable, as it is intricate and incompletely surveyed. The anchorage off Laft point would form a good harbour lor the largest ships. The tide at the springs runs about 2 knots an hour here. In conjunction with Bandar ’Abbas, Hormuz and Qishm islands, and Basidu, Clarence straits prossesses many necessary qualifications for a naval base, occupying a strong strategical position commanding the entrance to the Persian Gulf.( *10 ) CHAPTER IX. n Administration. Sultan Ahmad, the reigning Shah, was born 20th January The Shah. 1898, and succeeded his father (Muhammad’Ali Shah who abdi cated), 16th July, 1909, under the regency of’AH Riza Khan, Azud-uI-Mulk, Chief of the Qaj-r tribe. The latter died on the 22nd September 1910 and Nasr-ul-Mulk, formerly a cabinet Min- * ister, was elected Regent. The heir apparent, Vali ’Ahd, is a younger brother, Muhammad Hasan Mirza, born 19th February 1899. The present Shah is the seventh of the dynasty of the Qa- Constitution, jars. According to the Constitution, the Shah must belong to the Shi’ah faith, and his successor must be his eldest son or next male heir in succession, whose mother was a Qajar princess. The form of Government in Persia up to 1906 was very simi lar to that of Turkey. The Shah, within the limitations imposed by the Muhammadan religion, was an absolute ruler. In Januar v 1906, the then Shah, Muzaffar-ud-Din, yielding to the popular clamour gave his consent to the establishment of a national council or majlis. The number of members was first fixed at 156 Majlis. (60 for Tehran and 96 for the provinces). On 7th October 1906, the Majlis met for the first time and elected a president. Provi sion was now made for a senate of 60 members, 30 to be appoint ed by the Shah, and 30 to be elected by the Majlis ; this senate, however, has never yet been formed. In the meantime, Muham mad ’All succeeded his father as Shah early in 1907. He had al ready signed the Constitution, as heir apparent ; he now confirmed this, signed the final constitution, and on November 12th, 1907, before the Majlis, took the prescribed oath. The first Majl : s was dissolved on 23rd June 1908, and abolished by decree, the Parliament building being partly! demolished and sacked by the troops. The Majlis did not meet again till 15th November 1909, af ter the nationalists had entered Tehran. In April 1910, it was reported that the deputies then numbered some 60 members, who were divided into two principal groups, known generally as316 “ extremists ” and “ moderates The former were described as “ a noisy minority.” The “ moderates ” supported the two Chiefs, Sipahdar and Sardar As’ad, and' advocated a patient attitude to wards Russia. Since Nauruz 1910, a new hall for the Mayas has been fitted up at great expense. The deputies no long er sit on the floor, but are accommodated on luxurious benches arranged in tiers facing the presidential chair. Speeches are de livered from a tribune, and proper arrangements have been made for the diplomatic body, the public, and the press. The first election regulations were drafted in September 1906, and a later electoral law, dated 1st July 1909, was signed by the late Shah shortly before his abdication. This provides for the number of representatives of the people, and their distribu tion in the provinces and districts. The number of deputies of the people is .ixedat 120. The qualifications for the electors are as follows they must be Persian subjects at least 20 years of age, known locally, and owning a fixed amount of property. The next article defines those that have no electoral rights. Next the qualifications for those elected are laid down,—they must be true Moslems,, except representatives of Christians, Parsis and Jews, they must be Persian subjects, able to read and write Persian and be not less than 30 and not exceeding 70years of age. The elections are by two degrees, the meaning of which is that in the quarters of a town or in the towns of an electoral district, a particular number of persons is chosen by the electors; then those persons, elected in the first degree, meet at the centre of the electoral district, and elect from among themselves the desired number ; those elected in the second degree are the “ representa tives.” jfgferial ofees c Premier Minister Minister Minister Minister Minister Minister Minister Is two chief leac &amp;(iar As’ad 6% 1910, (kb 'In® immediate which capacif is* time.

This state of affairs still continues. At the end of 1910 the Ministerial offices consisted of the following :— Premier. Minister of the Interior. Minister of War. Minister of Finance. Minister of Justice. Minister of Foreign Affairs. Minister of Posts and Telegraphs. Minister of Education. The two chief leaders of the national movement, Sipahdar and Sardar As’ad were, from the time of the coup cV&lt;tat till July 1910, Cabinet Ministers. They then resigned office, but were immediately elected as ordinary deputies of the Maj- lis, in which capacity they continued to support Government for some time. The Cabinet so far recognise their own weakness, that they Foreign officials have submitted proposals to the Majlis for engaging foreign t0 a ? s ^ 8ttho officials for the different ministries, stating also, that it might Cabll! be necessary to empower officials engaged from abroad with ex ecutive functions and not limit their powers to the mere giving of advice. The question of the nationality of these foreigners aroused much controversy in various quarters. Finally in the beginning of 1911. five American financiers, with Mr. Shuster at their head, were engaged to place the Persian finances on a sound basis. By the supplementary fundamental laws of 7th October Provincial and 1907, it was provided that throughout the whole empire, Oouiiciis. lClltal provincial and departmental councils called anjumans should ( An i uman s.) be established. The members of these were to be elected by the people, and their duties were to exercise complete supervision over all reforms, connected with the public interest. The various anjumans, which now exist in Persia, mostly came into being during the Constitutional movement, which marked the end of 1908 and the beginning of 1909. These local bodies have not, however, fulfilled expectations. At the inauguration of each assembly, provision was made for the proper conduct of local affairs, but the experience of a few months was sufficient to show that the anjumans had no clear perception of their du ties, could not dissociate themselves from party and racialfeelings, and had no real weight with their respective local Gov ernments. The better class of citizens soon became reluctant to serve on the anjimans; public confidence was lost and interest declined. In most cases these bodies have lost all their importance, and in some instances have ceased to exist. The latter has been the case at Bushire. At Shiraz, Meshed and Tabriz the anjumans have sunk into a state of impotence. Administrate The country is divided into 33 provinces, which are o le provinces. g 0verne( j Governors-General, who are directly responsible to the central Government, and can nominate the Lieutenant-Gov ernors within their provinces. Some of the Governments General are very small, and do not bear sub-division into districts, etc.; whilst others are very large, and comprise several provinces. The number of Governments frequently changes, as several pro vinces are sometimes united under one Governor. The provinces are called viliyat or ayalat, and are sub divided into districts and sub-districts, called mahal, bululc (or b ldgh),nahlyeh, etc., which are again sub-divided into parishes and villages. Governors have the title of Vdli, Far man Farrnd, Hakim, or Nazim. Deputy Governors are known as Ndib- l- Hitkmah, and the Governor of a small district as Zdibt. Every town has a chief Magistrate or Mayor called begldr- begi, kaldntar, or ddruga ; every parish (mahalleh) of a town and every village has a headman called kadkhudd. These officers, who are responsible for the collection of the revenues and the or derly state of their towns, parishes or villages, are sometimes ap pointed by the crown, sometimes by the Governor, but general ly elected by the people. In the larger provinces, the Governors have attached to them a man of experience, to whom is entrust ed the accounts and details of the Government. This person is often nominated by the Central Government, and is called Vaz'r. or plshkdr. He has extended administrative powers, including at times the military command of the province. For the collection of revenues in towns and villages, the chiefs are often assisted by a pdkdr, who is a man of experience elected by the citizens. Vaz rs, p'shkdrs, and pdkdrs derive their incomes from cer tain charges, paid by the citizens in excess of the assessed revenues, and from payments in cash and kind extorted from the cultivators. In each province there are also a number of Govern-319 ment officials representing various departments, notably the ac countants of the Revenue Department, called mustaufi, sar- rishtehdar, doftardar; and those of the Military Department called lashkarnavis, all in direct communication with the Central Government. A system of purchase is in vogue, by which all these posts from the Governor downwards, are sold to the highest bidder ; this practice greatly militates against the efficiency of the ad ministration. To recoup these officials, for the bribes or gifts required to secure or retain office of any description there exists a cherished national institution in Persia, viz. , the raudakhil, which Lord Curzon describes as “ consideration, recompense, or profit, which is required to balance the personal account He further adds that the reason why the people endure it is, pro bably, because each man cherishes a hope that one day he may be in a position to reap a similar harvest himself. A second reason for the continuance, and as a product of the existence of this system, is the low r and inadequate figure of official salaries in Persia. That which is known as muddlchil from the point of view of the recipient, is classified as pishkash or gift (literally that which leads on or comes before) from the standpoint of the donor. The obvious result of the system is corrupt adminis tration and neglect of public works, and, indirectly, the enor mous number of attendants and retainers that swarm round officials. Among the nomad and military tribes, a different system of ■Nomad tribe-, appointments and titles prevails, the Governors^ of the Kurds, Bakhtiari, and other clans being known as Ilkhdni. Ilbegj, or Vdl&lt;, and their subordinate chiefs as Khan, Shaikh, Tushmal, etc., all of these being responsible to the Governor of the Pro* vinoe, in which they reside, for the collection of revenue. Slstan, for administrative purposes, forms part of the pro- ^ d s T s “J ratl0 “ vince of Khorasan, and the Governor of Sistan, locally known^as the Amir, is subordinate to the Governor-General of Knorasan, to whom he pays annually the Government revenue of the dis trict. The Persian Government have, of late years, begun in Sistan the policy, long practiced elsewhere, whereby the power of local Governors has been greatly restricted. Thus the Governor here is no longer the supreme local authority m all320 matters relating to administration, justice and everything else in the country, and his^ sole remaining duty seems to be the maintance of order in his district. A sarhaddar, in charge of the frontier of Sistan and Balu- chist'n and directly subordinate to the Foreign Minister at Teh ran, has charge of the military garrison and levy service. A muffatish, directly subordinate to the Minister of Revenue of Tehran, has taken complete charge of all revenue matters. Judicial administration is mainly in the hands of the priestly classes, triba,! sarddi s and village headmen. Larger Provinces Lord Curzon remarks that “ no principle, geographical, ox Districts. ethnographical, or political, appears to be adopted in deter mining the borders and size of the various divisions, which vary in extent from a province larger than the whole of England to a small decayed town with its immediate surroundings.” I.

The former are guided by the ’urf, the known or unwritten law, the latter by the shard, the divide or written law based on the Quran. Petty disputes are settled mayora of to ™ or village headmen, within their respective areas. ^The worst criminals are strangled, decapi tated or have their throats cut. Robbery and thieving are punished with mutilation, cutting off of a finger, thumb, hand or ear. The bastmado is the most favourite form of punishment, even for offenders of the highest rank. There is no such thing as penal servitude for life or even for a term of years; hard labour is unknown as a sentence ; and confinement for any lengthv period is rare. Women and male criminals of high rank are detained m the house of a priest. There is a kind of jurisdiction for commercial cases, some- Foremner, tunes assisted by a board composed of merchants. The tribu- and the law. nal of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at Tehran, as well as the agents {karguzdr) of that ministry in the provinces, look after civil suits between foreign and Persian subjects. In 1906, the Persian Government tried to introduce a law relating to jurisdiction in civil and criminal cases, in which foreigners might be involved in Persia. It was based on the system which obtains in like cases in Turkey. The Russian and British Governments, however, found it quite impossible to admit Persian jurisdiction over foreigners, in the present pri mitive condition of the country. British subjects have always been tried in Tehran at the fordgnOffice tribunal, before a Persian official assisted by the ffiitish Vice-Consul. In the provinces such cases are heard before the karguzdr, and the British Consul-General or Consul. The Persian clergy {ulema) are still very powerful, and, being Clergy, very conservative, are generally against all progress and re-322 Education. Office. form. In Persia, practically any person, capable of reading the Quran and interpreting its laws, may act as a mulld, and should he become known for his just interpretation of the Divine Law, and for his superior knowledge of the traditions and articles of faith, he is called mujtahid (literal meaning, one who strives hard) and is a chief priest. The mullds are referred to in questions of religious law, hold religious assemblies, preach in mosques and are appointed judges, head preachers, etc. There are many colleges (madraseh), supported by public funds, in which students are instructed in religion, and in Per sian and Arabic literature, as well as in a certain amount of scien tific knowledge. There are also many schools for children, while private tutors are employed by all families of means. A polytechnic school, with a number of European profes sors, opened in Tehran in 1849, has done much towards intro ducing the knowledge of Western languages and science into Persia, and four French professors were recently engaged for work at the college. A German school, with an annual subsidy of £2,400 from the Persian Government, and £1,000 from Germany, was open ed in 1907. Private subscriptions, raised in Germany, paid for the erection of a fine building with class rooms for 700 pupils, and suitable quarters for 5 German teachers and their families. There is also a French school supported by the Alliance Frangaise. Persian schools, with an improved system of teaching, have been opened in Isfahan, Tehran, Basht, Bushire and other cities, but are not well supported. The bulk of the population are taught only to read the Quran. A political college, Madraseh- i-Sidsi, prepares a few candidates for service in the Foreign Office. For military colleges, see Chapter V. The organization of a “ gendarmerie ” under foreign officers has lately been engaging the attention of the Government, but at present, although there are a few police in some of the larger towns, as Rasht, Meshed, otc., not much progress in the scheme is apparent. There is a chief of the police at Tehran ; the number of his men is given as :— Police 1,200. Gendarmes 300, of whom 150 are mounted.

Of the police'’ some have Lebels, others Werndls. It is proposed to add 400 men to the police and 400 to the gendarmes, and so keep a total force of some 2,000 men. The gendarmes are used for mounted patrol work, especially at night, for special missions, and as a support to the police on any extraordinary occasion. The total debt of Persia is very small, but owing to bad Finance, administration, there are very few sources of revenue that offer any security from an European financier’s point of view; these are already pledged to foreign loans. The revenue is affected by fluctuations in the value of silver. In 1875, 25 hrdns were equivalent to £1 sterling, at the present day the value of the lerdn is 53-54, but in Pebruary 1905 the exchange was down to 64‘25 per £1 sterling. Up to 1^09 the foreign liabilities were approximately In addition there were claims for compensation by Rus sian, British, and French subjects for losses sustained. The same year Monsieur Bizot, who was employed by the Persian Government to investigate the financial situation, es timated the total indebtedness of Persia at about £6,000,000. To the Russian Government To the British Government To the Russian Bank To the British Bank .. 3,300,000 at 5 per cent. 320,000 at 5 „ .. 1,160,000 at 0-12 „ 690,000 at 12* Total .. 5,470,000 * Now reduced to 7 per cent. promising prospects.For purposes of security, the resources of Persia are practi cally confined 'to the customs revenue, the average net annual income of which is about £520,000. On this, the first charges are secured to the Russian and British Government loans ; next to Russian and British banks, and finally to the pay and pension of European employ's, and to the Cossack Brigade. Sundry expenses, chiefly in connection with the customs ad ministration, and also the ex-Shah’s pension,* are also debited to this account. The total charges thus amount, it is calculated, to nearly £600,000, a sum considerably in excess of the average income. The regular revenue of Persia is derived from the follow ing sources (1) Regular taxation. (2) Revenues of Crown lands. (3) Customs. (4) Rents and leases. As no official statistics of revenue and expenditure have hitherto been published, the amounts derived from each source can only be conjectured. More than half the revenue consists in payments, in cash or kind, raised by assessments upon towns, villages and districts, and almost the entire burden lies upon the labouring classes. The amount collected from Christians, Jews, and Parsis is small. Taxation (maliat) is assessed under three headings, land tax, herd tax and trade tax. The main and staple source of revenue in Persia is, and al ways has been, the land tax. Religious endowments and lands held on the basis of feudal service are exempt from this tax, but it is levied on all other landed property, and about i of this revenue is paid in kind, usually cereals or bhusd. The principle upon which the land tax rests is that 4 or 20 per cent, of the produce is the property of the Shah. The system, however, varies in different parts of the country. In irrigated lands, the amount is commonly based on the nature or amount of the water-supply. * Declared to be forfeited in September 1911.P»™» te bura7tt^ not yet grasped the fast ilji . t/ ” J' P rovmcr ' i have eTnraSThaf t! ^^8^* Ttte aSSSSSSSSHt :°x s^£f 5 SS rHHfSHi Herd on the eon- ^Unadesn.W^S^lS-X^ the expenses of cultivation. parties to S iJ™s?o 0 l t i 8 s? &lt; t rganiZati , On Md a&lt;J “&gt;i”«tration of the Per- Cnsto™. sian customs was taken over by a staif of Belgian officials nnrW the directorship of M. Nans. Previous to that date, the post of collector of customs was farmed out to the highest bidder with results that were more satisfactory to the holders of the post than to the Treasury. The financial difficulties, in which Persia found herself, induced her to undertake measures for the adop turn of a more profitable system of collecting her customs and resulted m an application, in 1898, to the Belgian Government for the loan of a staff of Belgian officials. eminent The request was complied with, and, in 1899, as a tentative measure the custom houses of the provinces of Azarbaijan and Kirmanshah were entrusted to the Belgians. The result rum ed S ° satisfactory that, m 1900, th? Persian G 0 ™mm 6 n t ' abolished the farm system and extended the new r/gme to the remaining provinces. Under the new system, the revenue deriv-326 Banks. ed-by the State from the customs has shown a marked increase. In 1901, it amounted to nearly £320,000, whereas under the old system it seldom reached more than three-fifths, of that sum. In 1902-03, it reached £418,000 ^gross: and £380,000 net. In 1903 a new tariff was introduced (?ee Chapter I\ r , Commerce) which produced a further net increase, so that in 1907-08 the maximum receipt of £600,000 net was obtained. Owing to the present disorganised state of the country, there is at present (1911) a falling off. Rents and leases include the proceeds of various establish ments, institutions, or concessions, owned and leased out by Government. Of these, the Mint is worth about £50,000 a year ; post, telegraphs, passports, mines, press, share in the profits of concessions, Caspian fisheries, etc., may pemaps be worth £100,000 more. Irregular revenues, or sursat are sums arbitrarily and sud denly levied to meet some temporary need, or forcibly elicited under the disguise of gifts. The former is called sadr, and is a species of Persian ship-money, being a levy from a district or province, or even the entire kingdom, to meet some special expenditure. The latter is called pishJcash, and was very preva lent under the old regime, taking the form of offerings to the Shah, at Nau-Ruz, and other festivals. Expenditure. It appears impossible, in the absence of reliable statistics, to give, even approximately, the amount annually expended on the civil list, up-keep of army, public works, pay of Govern ment departments and payment of an enormous number of pensions. It is, however, generally supposed that internal loans and arrears do not exceed a total of £1,000,000. To meet everything, there appears to be an annual revenue of about £1,750,000, an amount which might be doubled under a good administration. (1) The Imperial Bank of Persia. This bank is, on the whole, the most important and valuable British institution in Persia. It was founded in 1889, in virtue of a Persian conces- £3,000,000. Bank notes may be issued in Persia to the extent sjilirongh which ion of the letter i awded in neutra i right to grant linperial Bant of I aal Bank, and ha; aiah, Isfahan, §fkhsm ikwn as the Ban lie Eossian State B aGorsmment. i ■■ffl tranches at Ri 3w,inthe fuh : Mar 'Abhis. ii fee mentioned ■' :i tf Russia, for a ^reused to be W k Commerce d( i the De •W The 3 ^Ndeahf the newly ele M; i® 8 was th327 one-third of the paid up capital. The majority of the Board must be of British nationality. See page 173. The bank has served a most useful political purpose, as the Agency through which the Persian Government has been en abled to accept loans from Great Britain, without too flagrant a violation of the letter of the Russian loan contracts, and has thus succeeded in neutralizing the danger of Russia acquiring the sole right to grant supplies to the Persian Government. The Imperial Bank of Persia is represented in India by the National Bank, and has branches at Tabriz, Rasht, Meshed, Kirmanshah, Isfahan, NTasratabad (Sistan), Yazd, Shiraz,' Kirman, and Bushire ; and native agencies at Ramadan and Kashan. (2) The Russian “ Banque d’E&amp;compte”. This was for merly known as the Banque des Prets de Perse, and is connected with the Russian State Bank ; it is virtually a department of the Russian Government. Its headquarters are at Tehran, and there are branches at Rasht, Meshed and Tabriz, and possibly branches may, in the future, be established at Kirman, Bushire and Bandar ’Abbas. .As above mentioned, the bank has made large loans to the Persian Government, secured on the customs receipts. As a condition of these loans, it was stipulated that Persia should repay the balance of the British loan of 1892, and agree to con tract no further loans from any foreign power without the consent of Russia, for a period of 10 years from 1900. (3) There used to be in Tehran a branch of the Russian ‘'Banque de Commerce de Moscon it was withdrawn in 1904. In July 1906, the Deutsche Orient Bank obtained a conces- np rman h ^ sion from the Shah to open a branch at Tehran, and at Tabriz aD ' also if required. The object was stated to be purely commer cial, but a good deal of political backing was apparent. In July 1907, the newly elected Majlis confirmed the agreement, but introduced many restrictions. One of these was that the bank must open within 3 years from the date of the agreement. The concession was not nearly so good as that enjoyed by the British Imperial Bank of Persia. An extraordinary point in the negotiations was that the German Bank asked for great privileges from Persia, but offered nothing in return. Tho328 only possible advantage to the Persian Government seemed to be the prospect of a substantial loan in the near future. On the 24th July 1909, the Deutsche Orient Bank not having opened an office in Tehran, the concession lapsed. The Ger man Legation tried unavailingly to obtain a prolongation of the time limit, but it seems probable that the enterprise is only abandoned till conditions are more favourable. On 1st December 1910, British representatives were thus presentatives distributed :—■ in Persia and the Persian Gulf. Place.

The unit of money is the krdn, a silver coin weighing Coinage. 71-04 grains troy ; its value varies with the price of silver, at the present time (1911) it stands at about 4|(f. In consequence of an excess of coinage, the copper money greatly depreciated in value from 896. The Government then decided to introduce a nickel coinage, and pieces of the nominal value of and ^ krdn, coined at Brussels, were put into circulation in 1900, the copper coinage being withdrawn. About five million krdns, face value, of nickel coins must now be in circulation. 8. d. krdn 0 22 krdn 0‘44 krdn ]•]0 krdn 220 shdhi 4-40 8-80 1 10-00 Note .-—The equivalent in British money varies according to the rate of exchange. In calculating the above 5 4 krdns are allowed to the £1, this would bo a favourable rate, the exchange has fallen at times to 60 and even lower. Gold coins are : 1, 2, 5 and 10 tumdn. These arenot in circulation owing to their ever-varying silver value. A tumdn in silver is the equivalent of 10 krdn? (worth 3s. 4d. in 1910), but a gold tUman has a value of 22 krdns. (Is. 4d.). Accounts are sometimes reckoned in dinar, an imaginarj^ coin, the ten thousandth part of a tumdn of 10 krdns. A krdn therefore —1,000 dinars ; one shdhi=50 dinars. The above is the general currency of Persia, and Persian money is acoep^ed (and sometimes Persian weights are used) in Trans-Caspia and Wes'ern Afghanistan. There are, however, local variations; for example, the nickel shdhi are not accepted iuKJhorasan, Trans-Ca-spia, or Afghanistan, but the old copper The coinage consists of Nickel Silver 1 Shdhi 2 Shihi 5 Shdhi 10 Shdhi 1 krdn 2 krdns 5 krdns = i — A 9 - 203.34 Weights. coins are current. Of the latter a is a copper coin, the size of an Indian pice, a shahi, a copper coin, the size of a half anna piece. The hran is often called hnzdr, from 1,000 dinar being rec koned to it. Though there are silver krdn pieces, the favourite coin is the silver 2-krdn piece ; this coin is often called a gudgdri, especially by Afghans and Baluchis, this being their pro nunciation of Qdjdrl, a name given on account of the image of the Shah on the coin. The Imperial Bank of Persia issues notes in denominations of 1, 3, 5, etc., tumdn. These notes are current in all towns of Persia, though a discount is generally charged, if out of the circle in which they are issued. Weights and measures differ in almost every province and toAvn.

As 100 man= 1 kharvdr, a kharvdr of Tabriz man =649 lbs, and one of shah-man=1,298 lbs. The following are some of the different weights used in the various localities.

The unit of linear measure is the zar, or gaz, and of this standard there are also several, but the most common is the so-called Tabriz one (which is not used at Tabriz), equalling 40-95 inches. The/orsaM = (theoretically) G,000zars or 3-87 miles, but varies in different localities, the generally accepted meaning of farsakh is the distance an animal loaded with bag gage can traverse in an hour. In Azarbaljan the zar=44-09 inches. The jar'b is the unit of area measurements, and varies from 1,000 to 1,066 square zars, or 1,294 to 1,379 square yards. A khlsh is only an approximate form of land measurement, and being such, only its approximate equivalent can be arrived at. It is described as the amount of land in which 15—20 mans hawizeh can be sown, roughly about 10 acres. The calendar in use in Persia is the lunar, known as the Hijfyeh, because its era begins with the flight (Hijreh) of the prophet Muhammad from Makkah (Mecca) to Madinah 16th July (622 A.D.) It has years of 354 or 355 days, divided into twelve months, consisting alternately of 29 and 30 days. To the last month an extra day is added eleven times in a period of 30 years, the year then consisting of 355 days instead of 354. Thirty- two Christian years are nearly equal to thirty-three Muham madan years. In Government accounts and documents a solar calendar is always used together with the lunar. This calendar has years, beginning on the vernal equinox, the 21st of March (nauruz), with 36f to 366 days. It is known as the ulghur or Mongolian calendar. The years run in cycles of 12. Each year is distinguished by the name of an animal, and Government documents written during it are dated with this name, and have in addition the Hijreh date. The names of the animals distin guishing the years are in Turkish, and the word il, meaning year, is suffixed, e.g., tungdz il (year of the hog).( 337 ) \\b } CHAPTER X. Communications. Roads, railways, waterways, telegraphs, cables, wireless tele graphy, posts. There are very few roads in Persia practicable for wheeled Roads ». traffic, and those that exist are almost all in the Russian sphere of influence. Made roads are not always viewed with favour because the bulk of trade is carried on by caravans of pack ani mals and the owners naturally prefer a track where there are no tolls. The chief main roads suitable for wheels, and on which car riages and postal fourgons travel without difficulty are (a) Rasht-Tehran, built by the Russians. (b) Julfa-Tabrlz, also Russian, with a projected extension to Kazvin ; reported to be constructed so as to be easily converted into a railway; rails,etc., necessary being stored at Erivan. (c) Kazvin-Hamadan, built by the Russians, with a view to a future extension on to Kirmanshah. (d) Tabriz to Urumieh vid Kh5I, to the Turkish frontier at Bayazid. This is a Persian road. (e) Tehran-Meshed. (/) Askhabad-Meshed. The Russians have constructed a road over the Elburz to Kuehan, thence onwards the road is Persian. (g) Tehran-Qum-Sultanabad. The result of British en terprise, see below “ Persian Transport Company (h) Qum-Isfahan-Shlraz, although this road has not yet been properly constructed, it is practicable for car riages throughout. In addition to the above, there are various roads on which wheeled traffic is possible either throughout or in parts; e.g., roads from Meshed to the Eastern Frontier ; and from Kashan to'338 f Lynch road. P orsian Transport Company. Yazd and Kirman. The latter, though not a built road, is unusually good, and fit for carts throughout. The remaining roads are either caravan or mule tracks, which have existed from time immemorial, and have been, to some extent, improved for commercial purposes by a slight ex penditure of labour ; or are natural paths worn smooth by gen erations of transport animals. Long stretches of sand, rough mountain tracks covered with boulders and loose jagged stones, slippery rocks, narrow defiles, and steep gradients, are the cha racteristics of most Persian roads. The numerous irrigation cuts, which intersect the cultivated portions of the country, would prove serious obstacles to troops moving off the beaten tracks. The only made “ caravan ” road is from Ahwaz to Isfahan, and is commonly known as the Lynch road. In 1898, Messrs. Lynch took over a concession granted to a Persian subject for this road, with rights of levying tolls, and opened the road for traffic in the autumn of 1900. The road is supervised in co-operation with the Bakhtiari Khans, who have an interest in its profits and arrange for its guarding.' The number of transport animals using it shows a very large increase, having developed from almost nothing to the following approximate figures Camels .. .. 2,000 Mules .. .. 3,000 Donkeys .. •. 3,000 These animals are largely furnished locally, to the great ad vantage of the peasantry. During the recent disturbances in Persia, traffic on this road was never interrupted as on other routes, though in 1908 traffic declined temporarily. Road statistics from 1909 show 11,999 animals passing over it, carrying some 23,326 packages, aggregating about 1,485 tons in weight; whilst £3,636 revenue from tolls was farmed or collected by the Khans. Duting the summer of 1911, however, even the traffic on the Lynch road was temporarily restricted by the universal disturbances. The Imperial Bank of Persia obtained a concession from the Shah, dated 26th November 1889, for the construction of roads Tehran-Qum-Isfahan, and Qum-Ahwaz. The section Tehran- Qum was soon in working order with a regular carriage service running; but it was the only one the Bank ever really made. In I H Messrs.

Lynch opened negotiations for the transfer of these concessionary rights from the Bank, to the Persian Trans port Co., which they now formed. An agreement was signed by the Shah, on the 24th August 1901, confirming the transfer, and prolonging the period allowed for road construction for another ten years from that date. In the case of the road Hamadan-Kirmanshah, the period was pro longed for 12 years. Caravan roads were authorized, with the right to be deve loped at pleasure into carriage roads. Tolls were sanctioned, not only for the use of bridges but also for the general use of roads. A further concession was granted, to construct roads be tween the ’Arabistan road and Kirmanshah, and Kirmanshah- Hamadan, the conditions being the same as in the case of the other roads. If in the future railways are permitted in Persia, the company should have priority of right to construct a railway from the south to Tehran. Except in the case of serious famme, the Persian Government should not allow embargoes on the export of wheat from ’Arabistan. By the end of 1906, the statement of work done and projected by the company was as follows :—- Ahwaz-Ardal in the Bakhtiari country (kno wn as the Lynch road), joining up with the track to Isfahan. Caravan road projected. S ultanabad-Sh ush fcar, via Burujird, Khurramabad and Diz- ful, Trace not decided on. Carriage road already constructed. Tehrhn-Qum. Qum-Sultanabad. Carriage roads projected. Qum-Isfahan Sultanabad-Ha ma dan Sultanabad-Kirmanshah Caravan road constructed.340 Methods of travelling. Motor cars. Latterly, owing to the disturbed state of the county, especial ly in Lurist in, work has not progressed, and the Company are now afraid they will not be able to finish within the period allowed by their concession. They calculate that under safe conditions less than a year would suffice to complete the work. The greater part of their concessions lies within the Russian sphere of the Anglo-Russian agreement. The concession is very important, as by it the entire route, from the mouth of the Shatt-al-Arab to the capital of Persia is, in this way, to a large extent, under British control. On the better class of roads, as explained above, services of carriages and fourgons are maintained, but on ail others the only methods of travelling are by chapar-tiding, or by caravan. The former is the posting system, by which relays of fresh horses are obtained at the chdpdr- khdnehs, or post houses, every 20-25 miles along the routes. A single traveller, with a servant and baggage, would require at least four horses, one of which is ridden by the post boy, who takes the horses back. This method of travelling was formerly the only one, but is gradually dying out as more roads become available for carriages. Draught horses are then kept at the chdpdr-Ichdnehs mstead of riding animals. Travel- lixrg by caravan is naturally much less speedy, but more inde pendent ; the transport animals and caravan equipment are hired or purchased for the w r hole journey. The takhtravdn, or mule litter, is sometimes used by Persians when travelling. The Russians have lately started services of motor cars, hav ing arranged to participate in a concession granted to a Persian, Sani’ -ud-Dauleh, for this purpose. They at first tried them on the Tehran-Rasht road, but apparently found them unsatisfac tory, for they were discontinued. They are, however, now run ning regularly on the roads Julfa-Tabriz, and Kazvln-Hamadan, In October 1911, there were, on the Julfa-Tabriz road:— 4 passenger cars, capacity 14 to 18. 6 fifty H. P. goods cars. Mr. Newcomen, in 1905, suggested British motor services :— (a) Tehran to Shiraz, and if possible to Bushire, but the Persian Transport Company have no prospects of a concession, and a suitable road Shiraz-Bushire is extremely difficult, (b) Bandar ’Abbas-Bam, and possibly on to Kirman and Yazd. A “ Renard ” train was purchased by Shah Muza£far-ud- Dln during his last visit to Europe, and arrived in Tehran in 1906, IhgloJersian srliAareinusec | jracipal routes i at adopted for tl aatlrougli route a k tie most in ia? given.

References to the Route Books are given. Section I (N.-E; Persia). 1. Nasratabad (Sistan) to Meshed vui Blrjand, Kain, and Nasratabad to Turbat-i-Haidarl. This is an important trade route. ^h° d . via Total distance.- —500| miles in 29 stages. (a) Nasratabad-Birjand, Volume IV, 78, is a good camel road and practicable for field artillery throughout. Distance. —210J miles in 12 stages. The road .—General direction north-west. Is chiefly over easy open country. Stage 2, seven miles of -which are over a con tinuation of a hdmun, is impassable in wet weather. The pass in stage 11 would require improving for wheeled transport. Telegraph line follows the road in stages 1, 4, 8 9 and 12. Supplies .—For a few months after harvest (end of July), supplies for a regiment, cavalry or infantry, probable at nearly all stages. For a large force a supply depot in advance at Bir jand is necessary. Water is sufficient for a brigade at all halting places, but might be deficient for numerous transport animals. Camel grazing .—Generally good. Fuel .—Somewhat scarce. Alternative stages .—From Zainulabad via Neh, Volume IV, 79, P 20 miles longer, and no supplies at four stages. (6) Bh’jand-Kam-Turbat-i-Ilaidari-Meshed. Volume I, 3, 290J miles in 17 stages, is a good camel road throughout, except stage 14, which becomes a quagmire in wet weather. Passable everywhere for artillery, but a few difficult places for wheeled transport. Important passes are the Saman Shah (0,7000 in stage 1, three Icutals (highest 6,800') in stage 7, the Khamari, stage 13 and Muhammad Mirza (6,540'), which are occasion ally blocked by snow.Camping grounds and water for a brigade, without many transport animals, at all halting places. A waterless march of 32 miles, ’Amrani to Maina. Supplies as between Nasratabad and Birjand ; advance depots for larger force necessary at Kain G unabad and Turbat, and transport for four days’ supplies. Fuel is rather scarce, camel grazing generally good. It is calculated that Cossacks and light artillerjr could move from Askhabad to Sistan, using this and other routes.(wd Khaf, etc.), in 30 days ; infantry and heavy artillery in 10.—-15 da.ys longer. Sistan-Meshed telegraph line follows the road, stages 1— 4, 13—16. Important alternative stages are Kain-Turbat via Rui Khaf, Vol. 1,11,165 miles in 9 stages. S upplies, water wad grazing good, but fuel sometimes scanty. The telegraph follows this route. Jum T n (Gunabad)-Turbat, ill miles in 7 stages, a good hard road well supplied with everything. An alternative route is Nasratabad-Sarbisheh-Durukhsh-Naudeh Pasang-Turbat- Meshed, total distance 457 miles, the shortest route available, but little used by caravans. Water is available and supplies for a small caravan. Only one pass is crossed. 2. Nasratabad (Sistan)-Duruh-Gazik-Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam- Meshed. Total distance, 486 miles in 29 stages. (a) Nasratabad to Gazik. 184| miles in 12 stages, Vol. IV, 74, is suitable for camel transport, also for artillery with some detours. Stage 2 is impassable when inundated. For con struction of a cart road improvements are required at (i) tho Gudar Masham pass (4,800''), stage 10. (ii). The kutal in stage 11. The road. General direction north-north-west. In stage 2, seven miles are across part of a hdmun, impassable in wet but dry in cold weather. In stage 4, the track crosses the Bandan pass, then follows the Bandan river for 2 stages ; thence for 3 stages is over open plain. Stage 10, Gudar Masham pass and another easy kutal are crossed. In stage 11 is a steep stony kutal, avoidable, it is said, by a detour. Limited supplies at stages 4 and 8, elsewhere nil. Water for the first 10 stages is very scarce. In stages 8 and 9, there is a stretch of 24 miles with only one well. At stages 11 and 12 the supply is good.Camel grazing is plentiful throughout, hut grass scarce; fodder could be collected from villages. Spring is the best time for marching, as the country is then green, there is more water and grazing, and standing crops could be cut for fodder. Fuel is plentiful at stages 2, 5, 6, 7/8, 9, fair at 3, none at 1. Alternative stages. —Between Nasratabad and Buruh via Asparan—and between Duruh and Tabas. (6) Gazik-Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam-Pariman-Meshed, Vol. I, 1. Distance 301 : } miles in 17 stages, is similar in character to the first section. For a cart road improvements are necessary at the Amrutakpass (6,6900, stage 2, a stretch of 4 miles of heavy sand in stage 3, and the low kutah in stage 7. The road has other wise no severe gradients, but would be heavy in parts after rain. Water-supply in stages 1 to 3 is good, but between 4 and 5 there is a stretch of 344 miles, waterless save for the small well at Chak- pai. This might be avoided by a detour, Findukt-Ruknabad- Mijnabad, total distance 44| miles. The remaining stages have plenty of water. Supplies for a considerable force are obtainable at Gazik, Tabas, Dastgardun and other villages of Sunnikhaneh district, and the Khaf valley could support a division for a week. Stages 1 to 6 furnish little beyond small supplies at Bamrad and Mij- nabad, and 7 to 11 nothing in any quantity. Between Turbat- i-Shaikh Jam and Meshed supplies are abundant. Camel grazing is plentiful throughout, except after Kariz ; south of Sangun there is scarcely any grass, but north of that place much lucerne is grown. The end of March and April is the best time for obtaining water and fodder ; but crops are not harvested till the end of June and July, so the stock of grain and dry fodder is then at its lowest. The movement of anything but a small force along this road would be difficult. Between stages 1 to 6 and 7 to 11, unless .advanced depots were arranged, grain and fodder would have to be carried. Water too in many places would be a difficulty. 3. Herat-Ghurian-Shurau-Rui Khaf-Turbat-i-Haidarl, total Herat to Tur- distance, 1891 miles in 10 stages. The road crosses the Persian bat-i-Haidari, frontier at Shurau, 72 miles from Herat in 3 stages. Here the 01 mrau '344 Meshed to Herat. Meshed to Zulfikar. water is bad, and supplies from Ghurian scanty. There are 5 routes, Rill Khaf to Herat via Ghurian, all have very bad water- supply. {a) Shurau-Rui Khaf, Volume, I, 21, is 46 miles in 3 stages. The road is suitable for camel transport only ; near Karat it is so bad and narrow that camels can get along with difficulty in single file. Supplies and water are for the most part scarce. (6) Rux Khaf-Turbat-i-Haidan, Volume I, 11, 72| miles in 4 stages. _ This is the route followed by the Meshed-Sistan tele graph line. It is practicable for wheeled transport throughout, but the Dehaneh-i-Darpal (stage 9) would present some diffi culty during snow or rain. Supplies are abundant, Khaf and Turbat-i-Haidarl being rich grain-producing districts. There is ample water and camel graz ing, but fuel is scanty in places. 4. Meshed-Kafir Kaleh-Herat,Volume I, 39, is the main cara van route, passable by artillery throughout, and for wheeled transport, with slight improvements between Bakirabad and Farlman. There are no severe gradients, but the track is heavy in places after rain. Water is good, except for 20 miles from Turbat-i-Shaik Jam to ’Abbasabad. Supplies and fodder plen tiful, camel grazing poor. Total distance to Kafir Kaleh, where road enters Afghanis tan, 157 miles in 9 stages. Thence to Herat, see above in No. 3. Alternative route, Meshed-Kariz via Kalleh Minar, Volume I, 29, is fit for camels and is 151 miles in 10 stages. 5. Meshed-Kalateh Minar-Zurabad-Zulfikar. Total distance 124 miles in 8 stages. Volume I, 38, is a camel road, passable for guns, and easily made into a cart road. Water is abundant, except for 14 miles in stage*5. Supplies scanty, grazing everywhere abundant. Alternative route via Baghbaghu and Zurabad, llli miles in 7 stages, is better as regards supplies. From Zulfikar, on to the Russian post at Khushk is about 70 miles ; to Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam is 62 miles in 3 stages, over a rough mountain track. ilM-Sadrai aeUR (fe jgi ktince Ik m {stages by; M-Meshed-Sa a, Artillery i g ml rough bet' (WiafEMisini vii At Ik D is for blocking * Mows the left! ile for all armi jfflctannels. : ffein stages Mportat shor arable for a car do there is pracl Bsofficientfora |»t would be ai 'siybal is everywhere ^Wash in the] ®land5. ^is scanty fort] %a?iMeshe :r«5, kjdloklacles,- •iDarband ani345 6.

Sarakhs to Merv is 92 miles ia 6 stages by a good camel road. Road. Meshed-Sadrabad is unmade, but suitable for camels. Artillery and. carts would find the track very stce P. anc - rough between Ak Darband and Sadrabad. When the Kaskaf Rud i_s in flood, it covers the track with water and deep mud. At Ak Darband there is a defile affording astreno - position for blocking the road. From Sadrabad to Sarakhs the route follows the left bank of the Hari Rud and is unmade, but suitable for all arms throughout, the only obstacles beinw irrigation channels. ° Supplies in stages 1 and 2 are usually sufficient for a brigade with transport at short notice. In stage 3 and at Sadrabad they are procurable for a cavalry regiment or battalion with transport m 4 and 5 there is practically nil. Along the Hari Rud to Sarakhs supplies sufficient for a native battalion or cavalry regiment with transport would be available at short notice, unless the season were very bad. Water is everywhere sufficient for a brigade or more, but some times brackish in the Kashaf Rud. Grazing is good, especially in stages 4 and 5. ^ Fuel is scanty for the first 2 stages and then abundant. The Persian telegraph Meshed-Sarakhs follows the road as far as Shur- jain stage 5. Physical obstacles .—There is a fairly easy pass (3,600') be tween Ak Darband and Sadrabad. The Kashaf Rud is hard to cross except at recognised fords, and may be in flood in April and May ; in autumn it is often dry. AZfernafw’e roafeyid the Mazdaran pass, Volume I, 67, about D1 miles in 6 stages. This is the direct road from Sarakhs to Meshed, and would be practicable for guns with slight improve ments to the Mazdaran pass (3,250') the ascent of which is stony but not difficult, with easy gradients on both sides. The pass offers a strong defensive position, which can, however, be turned by footpaths. Supplies between Mazdaran and Sarakhs are not procurable till near the latter place.346 Meshed to Kalat-i-Nadiri. Askhahad to Meshed. In summer there would possibly be a waterless tract of 46 miles between Mazdaran and the Kandukli canal ; this could be avoided by going via Chah-i-Haji Bamzan, Thick is passable for guns with one detour of 8 miles. 7. Meshed-Bardeh-Kalat-i-Nadiri, Volume I, 61,70 miles in 7 stages, is a road suitable for mules only, but could easily be made practicable for artillery as far as Qardeh. Camels can work up to Balghur. The last five stages traverse mountainous country. Supplies are obtainable for small parties at all halting places, also water. There is no information about grazing, but fuel is procurable. Physical obstacles.- —The Mirza Kuskt pass; 6,400', is crossed in stage 6, and has a very steep descent on the northern side. The Diveh Buiun kuial, in stage 5, is very difficult. The Trans-Caspian railway at Dushakh is about 30 miles from Kalat-i-Nadiri. 8. Askhabad-Kuchan-Meshed, Volume I, 44, is a made cart road and carries a constant traffic of carriages and pack animals. Total distance .—127 miles in 13 stages. It can be divided into two sections :— (a) Meshed-Kuchan, 98 miles, practically level over clay soil. The road is not kept in good order, being either deep in dust or mud according to the weather. Bridges and culverts are in very bad repair, but the surrounding country being level, detours are always possible. (b) Kuchan-Askhabad is 79 miles, all among hills except the last 10. The road is graded, but suffers from neglect except the portion under Russian control. Five ranges of hills are crossed, none of any great height; and tw'O rivers, the Atrak and the Duringar, both fordable. Supplies and water. —In section (a) abundant. In section (b) scanty. Transport. —No draught nor other post horses are now kept on the road. There are camping grounds in section (a) for an army corps. In section (&amp;), for a small force 2-| miles beyond Imam Quli at the river, and a very good ground just north of Gaudan.347 A single telegraph line generally follows the road through out, with stations at Kuchan, Bajgiran and Gaudan. 9. Kuchan-Shirvan-Bujnurd-Gurgan-Astarabad. Total distance .—259 miles in 11 stages. Divided into two f^rabad sections. (a) Kuchan-Bujnurd, Volume I, 48, ; 85 miles in 7 stages. This route, though 11 miles longer than No. 47 is easier and prac ticable for field guns throughout. Water is abundant and grazing good. Shirvan is the only large village passed, but the country is rich and well cultivated, and would furnish large amounts of supplies. (6) Bujnurd-Gurgan-Astarabad, Volume I, 78,174 miles in 11 stages, is the shortest route and passable by camels, but not artillery. Water and fuel are plentiful, but supplies scanty. There are several alternative routes :— (i) via Nardin, 198£ miles in 13 stages, which might be made passable for wheels with a little improvement. (ii) via the Atrak river, 214 miles in 13 stages, suitable for mules only. 10. Tehran-Samnan-Damghan-Shahrud-Sabzawar-Meshed is Tehran to the main caravan route, used by pilgrims and for transport of Meshed merchandise all the year round. A carriage road throughout. Total distance .—566 miles in 23 stages. (a) Tehran-Damghan, Volume IT, 5. Distance .—216 miles in 9 stages. The road is generally across desert, except for the cultivation around villages. It is only mountainous between Samnan and Ahuan. It is never repaired, but a Persian Com pany was reconstructing it, with a view to establishing a motor service eventually to Meshed: the work was in charge of a Belgain engineer. Tue Persian Company has has now (1911) abandoned this project. Caravans generally travel at night, but this is unnecessary from September to June. In summer the heat is excessive. Snow sometimes falls at Ahuan, but never blocks the road.Supplies are generally sufficient for ordinary traffic, but some times scarce in spring. Large quantities could only be collected %ith difficulty, except in the YaramTn District and near Damghan immediately after the harvest. Water is brackish throughout, and in stages 3, 4, 5 and 6 is apt to cause dysentery. There is always plenty for animals. Grazing for camels is good everywhere. There is no grass, and all animals feed on the tops of brushwood and sparse weeds. Fuel .—Wood is scarce, but brushwood plentiful throughout. Transport .—Wheeled traffic is rapidly superseding pack transport. Light, springless, Russian waggons drawn by four horses abreast carry the mails, pilgrims and other travellers of limited means. The same class of vehicle is used for ordinary merchandise and passengers. Pilgrim caravans are the largest that use the road. Shoeing smiths are available and shoes procurable at most places. At each post station, 12 to 16 horses, in good, hard condition, and used to riding and driving, are kept. In spring few mules are obtainable, as they are taken to the mountains to graze. There are no physical obstacles to stop even heavily laden waggons. The telegraph line follows this section throughout. There is a branch line from Samnan to Firuzkuh. b) Damghan-Meshed, Volume I, 69, Distance .—350 miles in 14 stages. The road is very similar to the part above described. There is a mountainous stage just before Meshed. In winter, and after heavy rain, the 8 miles between Zaminabad and Husainabad are difficult owing to the soft nature of the soil. Supplies in large quantities could only be collected near Mazl- nan immediately after the harvest; but a very fair amount can always be obtained in the Sabzawar and Nishapur districts, es pecially after harvest. The telegraph line follows the road except from Nishapur to Meshed. A branch line goes from Shahrud to Astarabad. 11 . Yazd-Jandak-Damghan. Total distance, —329£ miles in 18 stages.349 (a) Yazd-Ardakan, Volume, I, 142 . Distance.—^ miles m3 stages. It is practicable for wheeled transport throughout. Supplies and water are plentiful. An alter native route via Ruknabad is only 39 miles, but more sandy. ( 6 ) Ardakam-Jandak, Volume I, 145. Distance.—132 miles in 8 stages. This is a caravan route used every winter by cornel kafilehs. It is passable for all arms. There are no supplies except at Jandak, but sufficient water is available for small numbers at all stages. . ( c ) Jandak-Damghan, Volume I, 151. Distance.—15U miles in 7 stages. It is suitable for camels, except in wet weather when it becomes quite impassable, but impracticable for field artillery Its importance lies in the fact that it is the only way to pass the Ramr, which is just 68 miles across here, from north of Jandak to south of Maluman. The remainder of the road is practicable lor all arms. In summer the heat is terrific. There are no supplies nor water between a hauz north of Jandak and Maluman ; at other stages small to fair quantities. 12 . Yazd-Mshapur-Meshed, Volume I, 95. Total distance.— , 506f miles m 29 stages. An important caravan route, being Yazd to Meslied ' a continuation of the Bandar ’Abbas-Yazd road. It is suitable for camels and with slight improvements for field artillery. The water-supply is generally unsatisfactory, sometimes nil. Supplies are scanty, and sometimes none at all till Khur- ramabad, after which they are abundant. Camel grazing is . generally obtainable. 13. Tun-Duhak-Naiband, Volume I, 116. Total distance .—13H miles in 7 stages. This is a connecting Tan to link between the roads across the desert from Yazd, and those Naiband - from Kirman. It is practicable for wheeled transport, except for a hilly belt near Kaiband, which can be turned by a short detour. Water is good and plentiful at Duhak, Zanagun, and Nai- band ; brackish or salt everywhere else. Camel grazing is re ported scarce.350 Mashad-i-Sar Tehran. Tun-Bljistan is 42 miles in 3 stages, with water, supplies, and no obstacles. Thence to Turbat-i-Haidari is 62] miles in 4 stages. Tun- Kalat-Jumln is 47 miles in 3 stages, thence by- main routes to Turbat-i-Haidari, 96 miles. A good road and all requisites abundant. Section II. (N.-W. Peksia). 0 1. Mashad-i-Sar-Flruzkuh-Tehran, Volume II, 6. Total distance. —163 miles in 10 stages. The easiest route over the Mburz, but considerably longer than No. 9 of Volume II (see below). Snow sometimes blocks it, but is easily cleared away. It is a good road for mules throughout. The Guduk pass (6,620') is the main obstacle to a cart road. Supplies in small quantities are obtainable at all stages, ex cept 4 and 7, and water everywhere. Rice is abundant in the low lands of Mazandaran. Fuel is rather scarce, except in the valley of the Talar river. Physical obstacles .—As far as Haftan the road is liable to floods and the soil is boggy. Remarks .—The road lends itself readily to defence against an enemy advancing from the north. The long defiles as far as Guduk offer every facility for this ; a small determined force could confidently hold the 12-mile gorge between that place and ■ Surkhabad. Though this might be turned by the Duab defile, there also it should be very difficult to force a passage. Alternative route. —Tehran Imamzadeh Hashim pass, Amul, Volume II, 9. Total distance .—To Amul—110 miles in 6 stages ; to Mashad-i-Sar— 145] miles in 8 stages. After Rudian is only fit for mule transport. Supplies are obtainable, except at Baijan and Parasp, and water is plentiful. Physical obstacles. —The Imamzadeh Hashim pass is diffi cult. The stages along the valley of the Harhaz river are liable to be blocked by landslips, and are dangerous in winter and early spring. The gorge of the Harhaz river near Baijan could easily be defended against a force advancing from the north. I laul-Barfa] Jus 1,71 Til iistme.- His route folk jijoffso broker iofit.

This route follows the line of Shah ’Abbas’ ancient cause way, now so broken up that the road generally runs by the side of it. Suitable for mule and pony transport. Rivers are bridged, except the Talar which is unfordable 'when in flood. , abundant, water good, but supplies scarce, except at Amul, Barfarush and Sari. l A Persian telegraph line follows the road. 3. Tehran-Kazvln-Rasht-Enzali, Volume II, 16, was built Tehra . n to y a Russian Company with the financial support of the Russian Eazali ' Government. The road is metalled throughout and bridged Total distance .—234 miles in 19 stages. Scanty supplies are procurable at the post houses, but for a arge force previous arrangements would bo necessary. Water and fuel are abundant. J A Iter native routes are :—• I etween Tehran and Kazvin a caravan route, passable for ah arms and 2 miles shorter; and 3 mule tracks over the Elburz difficulties.--Alter heavy snowfall on the high domfnr aJOUt B Umal f 0 13 IiabIe to bo interrupted, but sfl- dom for more than a few days at a time. After much rain there re sometimes falls of rock, chiefly near Rustamabad. The Bikandi pass (5,000') is difficult in winter. The road has been now widened sufficiently to allow 2 carriages to pass abreast anywhere. Between' Tehran and Jiazvm 4 carnages could move abreast. It is, however not kept m good repair. The worst part is between Manjll and nudum, m which section, whenever rain falls, the road is blocked by falls of earth from above. Communications. —All posts and toll houses aion' this road are connected hy t lephone. A Persian telegraph line follows roughly the line of the road. Post houses are furnished with beds, tables and chairs.S52 Tehran to Julfa. Tabriz to Baya- zid, Khoi. The road Rasht to Gazian was built to allow goods landed at Enzali to reach Rasht direct, without intermediate boat trans port. It is a good road with iron bridges, and about 26 miles in length. 4. Tehran-Tabrlz-Julfa, Volume II, 92. Total distance. —437|- miles in 27 stages. A telegraph line follows this road the whole way. A main caravan route, and passable for artillery through out, though from Jamalabad to Mianeh, over the Kanlan Kuh pass, w'ould be difficult; otherwise a good cart-road could easily be made. Post fourgons are used except between Zinjan and Tabriz. Draught horses are kept between Tehran-Zinjan, and Tabriz-Julfa, and riding horses tetween Zinjan-Tabriz. A Russian Company holds a concession for the con struction of a chaussee from Julfa to Kazvln. The section Julfa-Tabriz is in working order, but doubts are still entertained as to its ability to withstand a heavy flood. The bridges are said to be made strong enough to take locomotives. Russian motor-cars traverse the distance in 3 hours. Supplies are abundant and water generally good through out ; fuel is occasionally scarce. The Russians have built an iron lattice-work bridge over the Aras at Julfa, and the road onwards, on the Russian side, is an excellent one. The Russian railway to Erivan was opened in December 1902, and the Erivan-Julfa section in August 1905. 5. Tabrlz-Kh5i-Kizil Diza or Bayazid, Volume II, 117. This is a part of the great caravan route to Trcbizond. Tail distance. —187^ miles in 17 stages. Section {a), Tabriz-Kh5x, has two main routes, one by the north of Lake Urumieh, the other via Sufian and Marand. The lake route is more generally used as supplies, and safety can bo depended upon, and it is well suited for camel and mule trans port, though from HajI Saiyid to Khoi is difficult, and from Tab riz to Tasuj is sometimes flooded. Section (b) Khoi to Kizil Diza is passable by carts, but the Dasht-i-Darreh or Dasht-i-Daneh pass is very difficult for them, and carriages make a detour to the east.

G. Rania-Urumieh.—■Volume II, 107. Distances. —Rania-Urumieh, 145 miles in 7 stages. Urumieh-Kh5i, 77! miles in 3 stages. This route would probably forma main line of advance Rania to into north-west Persia from eastern Turkey-in-Asiat Although Um ' llieh - practicable for military purposes much labour frwould be entailed in its preparation and upkeep for the passage of Large forces. The route varies from good going over open level ground, to steep ascents and descents through close hilly country or marshy swampy plains. It is passable for all arms in parts only. Although avoided by caravans owing to the turbulence of the frontier tribes, this route is reported to be the easiest line of communication between north-w est Persia and the Tigris valley. From Rania the road runs to Khol Sanjak, whence the Mosul-Blghdad road can be reached by easy stages. The lesser Zib river also is navigable for small steamers from Taktak (14 miles below Kh5I Sanjak) to its junction with the Tigris; the distance by river from Taktak to Baghdad is 326 miles. Snow blocks the passes during January and February, and military operations would not be practicable in winter. Except in the fertile Urumieh plain, supplies are limited. Grain and grass in the hilly parts are scarce. Fuel is obtainable in the hills ; dried cow-dung serves the purpose in the plains. Water is plentiful along most of the route. Pack buffaloes, don keys and ponies are obtainable near Urumieh, but very few are available in the hilly stages. Physical obstacles .—In some stages, the road is too steep for extensive traffic, and would require much labour to lessen the gradients. The Shulduz Chai, Lesser Zab, and Nistan Si! are all difficult to ford, and'would be impassble in flood time, when also the whole of the adjacent marshy land would bo impracticable to animals. 7. Baghdrd-Khaniqln-Kirmanshah-Hamadan-Tehran. Baghdadto , Khaniqiu. Tolxl distance :—517 miles in 33 stages.354 Ocean-going steamers ascend the Shatt-ai-'Arab to Basrah. Thence to Baghdad, the river steamers of the Euphrates and Tigns Steam Navigation Company traverse the intervening 500 miles in about 5 days. The Tigris is navigable for vessels drawing 5 in the rainy season and 3' in the dry. (a) Baghdad-Khaniqin-Kirmanshah, Volume, III, 96 222 miles in 15 stages. This is the main caravan and trade route between Mesopotamia and Persia. It is quite passable for wheels m dry weather, but in wet weather, unless the season is mild, it becomes in places a regular quagmire. Camels take -U days for the journey, horses and mules 14. Mules, ponies and donkeys are the usual transport animals, camels bein» on y used in the summer and not after the rains have set in.° Baghdad-Khaniqin is over rich alluvial soil, liable to inun- dation; one inch of rain makes the country impassable. A Persian Company keeps the road in fairly good order, though it is rough in places. It crosses low hills to Khaniqin, which offer no difficulties to railway construction. There is a regular carriage service for pilgrims between Baghdad and Shah- raban Climate.—In January and February the cold is considerable. July to September the heat is intense, but the nights are usually cool; m June there is generally a refreshing north breeze. Be tween Baghdad and Khaniqin the rains last from November to March; beyond Khaniqin thej begin earlier and end later. Snow falls between Sar-i-pul and Kirmanshah. Supplies of all kinds would be available in large quantities especially after the harvest. Grazing varies ; there is seldom much except in sprint. Bar ley and straw are always procurable. Fuel is scarce except in the Persian mountains. Water is good and plentiful throughout. Transport.—Kt Baghdad about 1000 camels could be col lected m a fortnight; other animals about 100 daily. Bevond Khaniqin no animals are obtainable until Kirmanshah. Most of the mules and ponies on this route come from Persia ; given time a very large number could be collected.

The boat bridge over the Di ala river, in its present state, is unfit for guns or heavy vehicles. At the Taq-i-Girreh pass (6,000') guns would have to be double- horsed. Stage 10 is either stony or swampy and intersected with streams. The Na’l Shikan pass requires improvement to make it fit for guns. {b) Kirmanshah-Hamadan, Volume II, 71, 103 miles in 6 stages, is the old post road and is followed by the Tehran- Khaniqln telegraph. It is passable for artillery throughout, and runs through mountainous country, with passes practicable for camels. Ordinary caravan supplies are procurable everywhere and for a considerable force at Kangavar. Water is good. Physical obstacles. There is a pass of 6,760' between Kangavar and Zagheh. The passes are sometimes closed by snow in winter. (c) Hamadan-Tehran, Volume II, 53, 192 miles in 12 stages, is the old post road, and the line followed by the telegraph, and is passable for wheeled transport. The post now goes by fourgons from Tehran to Qum, Sultanabad and Kirmanshah. Ordinary supplies are obtainable throughout, and large amounts of supplies at Nubartn, Bibikabad and Hamadan. Water is good except at Rahlmabad. The Shurrud, 36 miles from Tehran, is unbridged and passable in flood. 8. Tabrlz-Binab-Bijar-Kirmanshah, Volume II, 81. Tabriz to Kir- manshah. I otal distance.- —343| miles in 24 stages. This is a main caravan route, suitable for camels. Artillery tvould have to make various detours. The road is circuitous owing to the mountainous nature of the country. For wheeled transport a number of passes, none very difficult, would require improvement. Round Bijar two stages are sometimes blocked by snow. Supplies and forage are scarce in the first 3 stages, but obtainable at the remainder. Fuel and ivater are usually plentiful. A large force, moving slowly to collect supplies, would have no difficulties, except in winter. Many passes offer excellent defensive positions against the north, especially the Dlnavar defile.356 Kazvln to Hamadau- Hamadan to Burujird. Qum to Bum* jird. This route connects with Hamadan roin Bijar via Kuhkhurd ; distance 79 miles in 5 stages and tit for wheeled transport. 9. Kazvin-Hamadan, Volume 11,51. Total distance. —-145 miles in 8 stages, (12 for troops). This is a new road, bridged and metalled throughout, constructed by the Enzali-Tehran Road Company. The width of the metalled portion is 15'. Near Manian it crosses a pass 7,500' in height, the ascent on the north side being steep for the last 6 miles. Otherwise there are no difficulties to motor or other wheeled traffic. A tclc'phone wire accom panies the road throughout, and connects with all post and toll houses. Supplies are ordinary; from Nahvand to Ruan supplies in large quantities could not be obtained. JFaAr is always sufficient for a brigade, except at Sariab in a very dry season. 10. Hamadan-Daulatabad-Burujird, Volume II, 6. Total distance. —66J miles in 4 stages. Fit for wheeled traffic throughout. Riding horses arc kept at the post-houses. Supplies are plentiful at Daulatabad; about other places there is no late information. Water is abundant. 11. Qum-Sultanabad-Burujird, Volume II, 59. Total distance. —'158 miles in 10 stages. An important trade route. The road as far as Sultanabad has been made by the Persian Transport Company, and an extension is projected to Khurramabad and Dizful. This part-of the road forms the second section of the Tehran-Kirmanshah post road, and is suitable for wheeled traffic as far as Sultanabad. It is metalled where necessary and bridged; though narrow in places, the width is never less than 10 feet, and in most places is considerably more. Sultanabad—Burujird is suitable for camels, but could easily be made fit for guns. Supplies are not plentiful till Sultanabad is reached. Thence onward excellent, oven in spring when supplies are get ting low. Burujird could support a brigade. Water is good and abundant.

Tehran-Qum-Kashan-Isfahan, Volume II, 46, is a main road with a carriage post, by which the journey cam be per formed in 3J to 4 days. Total distance .—298 miles in 22 stages. Tehran-Qum is a made and bridged road, first opened in 1890. The mails are carried in fourgons, and the contractors also take passengers with the mails or in separate carriages. Qum-Kashan is the old post road, not made but partly cleared of stones, and fair for driving in good weather. Kashan-Isfahan is an excellent road, except for the last 2 miles into Isfahan, where several water channels, spanned by small weak bridges, incapable of bearing artillery or heavy waggons, have to be crossed. Ordinary travellers’ supplies are obtainable at rest house.-, but large supplies for troops only at Qum, Kashan, Natanz. Water is good as far as Qum, afterwards scarce at some stages. Grazing is scanty, and fuel very scarce. Transport. —Tehran-Qum, 12—16 horses are kept at each stage. Qum-Dehabad 8 draught horses, and thence onwards one team of 4 horses at each stage. In winter, numbers of camels may be obtained; in summer only mules. The old chdpdr route is via, Kashan-Kuhrud-Suh-Murchch- kliur. It is 31 miles shorter than the main road, impracticable for wheeled traffic, and covered with snow in winter. 13. Isfahan-Sultanabad-Hamadan, Volume II, 58. Total distance .—267 miles in 12 stages. This route is not staged for troops, for whom 17 stages could be arranged. Sultanabad to Hamadan has 7 post stages, which might perhaps be followed by troops. Tins route is less well-known than that via Burujird (see below). The section Isfahan-Sultanabad is extensively used for 9 months in the year. During the remaining 3 months it is closed by snow. It is easy for pack transport as 'far as Sultanabad; thence to Hamadan is a carriage post # road, which becomes blocked by snow in winter. Tehran to Isfahan. Isfahan to Hamadan.358 Isfahan to Burujird. Supplies are ample for the first 10 miles, after which the country is a succession of barren valleys between low ranges of hills. Large amounts of supplies are available at Sultanabad, small quantities at other halting-places. Supplies for one regi ment should be obtainable, at any time of the year, as far as Sultanabad, and for 2 regiments with a little notice. There is plenty of grazing for sheep en route, and a good deal of wheat is grown. Water is obtainable at all halting places, but, between Deh Haq and Tikan, there are 17£ miles without good water. Alternative routes ,— (a) Via Burujird. This is 10 miles longer. (b) Via Khunsar and Gulpalgan to Khumin. This is 7 miles shorter and the route usually followed. A Pioneer regiment would require a month to render the Isfahan- GulpIIgah section suitable for wheeled traffic, and there is a difficult ravine south-west of Khunsar, which alone would take 3 weeks work. Khunsar and GulpaTgan could supply a brigade for some time. There is good grrozt'ngr at Dumbineh ; thence to Gulpaigan fair only. 14. Isfahan-Burujird, Volume II, 63, 210J miles in 10 stages. Connects with the road to Sultanabad at Dumbineh, and could easily be made practicable for field guns. The most difficult part is the ascent of the high plateau near Tarun. Sup} lies, as far as Dumbineh, are sufficient for'a regiment, and for two regiments with notice. Fuel is scarce. Grazing poor except at Dumbineh. Every village has a flock of at least 300 sheep and goats, and milk is always obtainable. Water is good and plentiful. Transport .—About 500 donkeys could be collected, without taking animals belonging to professional chdrvdddrs. Climate .—From Isfahan to Darband, the road runs over a high plateau, where considerable cold, and storms of rain may be experienced in May, and it is sometimes blocked by snow in winter. The remainder is at a lower level and warmer. There are two caravan tracks, suitable for camels, as alternative stages, .silt easily 1 its are at Da iiir valley.

It is the main caravan route. The Lighirak pass is said to be impassable from snow after the 1st January but caravans can take a lower route. J ’ Supplies are fair throughout except at Nu Gumlaz Abun dant supplies are available at Kuh Pa. No details are known about Laghirak. Water is good except at Nu Gumbaz. Alternative routes.—{a) Via, the Zindeh Rud, No. 30, of Volume II, suitable for camels and practicable for guns, but rather difficult owing to irrigation ditches. Supplies and water are not so good. Distance, 186 miles in 11 stages, (b) Vi i Ushk and Sirv, the best summer route for troops, (c) Via Kiik Pa and Nain, 193 miles in 11 stages, the longest route. 16. Yazd-Nain-Kashan, Volume II, 29, 213| miles in 12 Y azd to stages, is a good level road suitable for wheeled transport. Water Kasban. is obtainable from wells throughout, except between Hasanabad and Nam, 31 miles. Supplies are rather scarce as far as Nam, but after that place sufficient for a considerable body of troops. This is the main caravan route to Tehran, and has a large traffic. At Nu Gumbaz (see preceding route), the Isfahan road branches off. Draught horses are kept at the [ ost-houses between Tehran and Yazd. Section III. (South-West-Persia). 1. Muhammareh-Ahwaz-Shushtar-Dizful-Khurramabad- Muhammerah Burujird. Total distance. —401 miles in 28 stages. to Burujird, vii Dizful and Khurramabad.360 (i) Muhammareh-Aliwaz via the western bank of the Karun, Volume IT, 89, is the main land route, and level throughout, the only obstacle to carts being the liability of the ground to become swampy after rain. The Karun is crossed in the last stage by ferry, and is about 250 feet wide here, and 18 feet deep, being deep ’ close to the bank. There is a small ferry boat capable of passing over about one ton of merchandise at a time. Horses and mules must swim across: the current is strong. This is an unimportant desert route, as practically all the traffic is by river. Distance.—82 miles in 4 stages. Supplies available are not worth considering. Graz'ng de pends on the rainfall. Fuel is obtainable in places, chiefly tamarisk bushes. Water in the Karun is always sweet, and after rain there are pools of fresh water along the route. (ii) Ahwaz (Bandar Nasirl)-Shushtar-Dizful, Volume III, 70, is easy for pack animals, except in wet weather. There would probably be no difficulty in constructing a cart-road; already it is fit for carriages as far as Shushtar in dry weather. The Ab-i-Gargar is crossed at Band-i-Qvr by a ferry, and the Ab- i-Shatait at Shushtar. The bridge at the latter place is broken at the centre arches, but should be easily repairable. The cross ing is a quarter-of-a-mile below the broken bridge by means of rafts on inflated skins. The river in spring is about 400 yards in breadth, with a current of 3-| to 4 miles per hour. Toe passage is dangerous for animals, which have to swim across, and this generally causes considerable delay. Distance .—99 miles in 6 stages. Supplies .—There is a considerable amount of cultivation all along the route ; large grain supplies should be available after harvest? The inhabitants own large flocks of sheep and goats. At Shushtar 1,000 men could be maintained. Fuel is very scarce, and obtained from about the Diz river.

It is only a fair mule track. Distance,. 220 miles in 18 stages. The nature of the hills admits the construction of a road with gentle gradients, and little rock-cutting. The road is never impassable on account of snow; its chief difficulties consist in the number of loose boulders strewn along it. There are no supplies except a few sheep and goats. Water is plentiful and good. Grazing for horses and mules is good and abundant, espe cially in the early summer months. Fuel is practically non-existent for the first 8 stages. Physical obstacles .— (a) The Glalan range iVcrossed by the Tang-i-Chal-i- Jaidar, winding and stony, but of good width; the final ascent is difficult. &lt; (b) The Tang-i-Panavur has an extremely difficult ascent to begin with. (c) The NaT Shikan pass is a very difficult but short ascent, over rocks and boulders. {d) The descent from the Kuh-i-Bavx is very difficult over boulders. (e) The crossing of the Dar Rud is difficult. Alternative stages.—From. Ab-i-Zal (stage 3) to Khurram- abad (stage 14), there is a devious but comparatively easy route, with abundant water-supply. (2) Ahwaz (Bandar Nasiri) Isfahan, Volume III, 69. This is known as the Bakhtiari or Lynch Road, already described in han'. aZ t0 S a ' previous chapters. It is used both in winter and summer, but The Lynch in winter is partially blocked by snow and closed to camels. oa Total distance. —276 miles in 18 stages, for troops 20 stages are recommended. The road may conveniently be divided into four sections:— (*) The plain section, Ahwaz-Salimeh, 42 miles over flat barren desert plain, suitable for wheeled transport except in wet weather,362 (w) The low hills section, Salimeh-Malamlr, 70 miles, a fair mule track, difficult in places, but never impassable except for a few hours after rain. It does not rise above 3,000', but could only with great expense and delay be made fit for wheels. (in) The mountainous section, Malamir Kharaji, 97 miles, varies greatly, according to the up-keep of the road* As a mule and camel track it is not good, nor easy, especially for large parties of animals ; and in places is incapable of being made fit for wheels. (iv) The.upland section, Kharaji-Isfahan, 67 miles, is a good camel and mule track, and guns could be got along it with difficulty. The road is suitable for infantry, except perhaps in January, February and March on account of snow, and from June to August on account of the great heat in the lower stages. Cavalry should not use it during the winter months, nor in summer except with local horses. The atmosphere is very dry. From 1st June to 1st October no rain falls. Military operations would be impossible in summer, the country being almost deserted and largely waterless. Transport .—It is said that the Ilidts require all their trans port for at least two months in spring and the same in autumn, and so would not part with their animals. Also that donkeys and bullocks are unsuitable means of transport for troops here, even if forthcoming. Supplies vary greatly every year. The main sources for large amounts of supplies would be Isfahan, Chehar Mahal, Dizful, Basrah, and the Tigris valley. Sheep and goats are very numerous, Fuel required in any quantity would have to be collected at depots. TFafer is mostly good, but from ’Ala Khur- shid to Pul-i-Shalu (57 miles) the supply is limited. Grazing .—Is poor and scarce, and in summer practically nil. Physical obstacles —• (a) The descent to the Karun at the Pul-i-Shalu (stage 7) is bad, but capable of improvement. (b) The descent from the Gardan-i-Marvarl (stage 9) to the Pul-i-Amarat over the Ab-i-Bazuft is, in summer, the most difficult point on the road, and would require much labour to improve it.

There is no track at first, but the route is passable by all arms though unsuitable, for troops owing to the marshy and unhealthy nature of the ground and the prevalence of mosquitoes. Distance.—126 miles in 7 stages. Supplies.—A large amount of wheat is grown in good years, but there is a great scarcity in bad ones. J Water. Througkoat, often brackish but drinkable. Fuel. —None.

Behbthan^^ 74 ^ fr ° m Ahw5z to and (m) Behbehan-Shlraz, Volume III, 61, is a caravan route and connects with Bandar Dilam. It is not much used owing to the insecurity of the road. Mule transport is chiefly employed, and on the maritime plain almost exclusively so. The track runs over rough hilly country broken up by ravines. Distance.—liGl miles in 18 stages. In summer on the earlier stages the heat would probably be excessive ;■ the winter is mild. Supplies.-At some large villages and in the valleys, grain nught be collected. Numbers of flocks and herds are owned oy the inhabitants, who are mostly nomads. Grazing is plentiful in summer. Fuel and wader abundant throughout.364 .

Total distance. —59J miles in 3 stages. Thi? road is used largely by caravans in summer and autumn, after the wheat and rice harvest. From June to September the heat would make military operations most diffi cult. At other times this route is best suited for an advance to the Bakhtiarl mountains. It is practicable for all arms, but requires cutting and widening for wheels in stage 1 about the 20th mile. Either bank of the Jarrahi river can be followed. The fords at Khalafabad are passable for laden animals except after rain; when unfavourable, boats may be collected at Makhsar for crossing. Supply of fodder depends entirely on the rains of the winter; if good, great quantities of bh'/sd are available, and large areas of wheat are standing from February to May. Water is everywhere available, but fuel scanty after Khalafabad. The Jarrahi river is said to be fordable at numer ous places in summer. Bushire to Shi- (6) Bushire-Shiraz via the Post Road, Volume III, 53. Road' P ° St Total distance. —182 miles in 11 stages. The Indo-European telegraph follows this route. Although this is the most important and direct route to the Persian plateau, it is one of the worst and most arduous in Persia. In parts, it is a difficult mule track over a series of very steep passes. The first 3 stages are over flat country, heavy after rain, and then impassable for camels. Thence to ShirSz it rises over a succession of four principal passes, from near sea level to an altitude of 7,400'at the Kutal-i-Prr Zan.

The track is difficult for cavalry, as horses have to be led up the passes in single file. The cold is sometimes severe from 21st December to 21st February, though the sun is powerful. Snow falls between mid- December and mid-March and cold winds are prevalent in January, February and March. The hottest months are June, July, August, and the heat is greatest between Dalaki and Kamar'j. Nights are always cool near Shiraz. Rain falls from December to March. The best months for marching are 15th March to 15th May, and in October and November. Supplies sufficient for one battalion of Indian infantry should generally be available. At Kazarun after the June harvest quantities of supplies are obtainable especially of grain. The supply of live-stock is limited before Kazarun, from which place onwards, except at Mian kutal, it is considerable. At Shiraz supplies are abundant. Water in stages 1 to 3 is generally brackish, but wells would furnish fair water sufficient for 2 battalions. At the remaining stages it is good and plentiful. In spring and autumn there is grazing for mules. Fuel is scarce for the first two stages, afterwards a fair amount would be available. Physical obstacles are numerous and formidable, some of the worst being the Kutal-i-Malu, the Kuta 1 -i-Kamarij, the Tang-i-Turkan, the track through the Dasht-i-Barm, and over the Kutal-i-PIr Zan.

On the whole it may be regarded as a camel or mule road though the Persians have used it for artillery. It may be divided into 3 sections:—- (i) To Ahram, 25J miles, the country is open and practicable for all arms, but liable to be heavy after rain, particularly the first stage. The Ahram river, if in flood, might prove troublesome. (m) Ahram to Kavar Serai, 144 miles, is a gradual rise over mountains, valleys and rivers, by a series of passes, none as formidable as the Tcutoils on the post road; *366 the Tang-i-Bahush would be bad^ for cavalry, and very difficult for artillery. {in) Kavar to Shiraz, 35 miles, is over fairly level country practicable for all arms. The last stage is apt to be heavy after rain. Wet weather, rather than excessive cold, is to be expected between 15th November and 15th March; never much snow, but the rivers are often impracticable. July and August are the hottest months. Supplies horn Tang-i-Zard onwards are said to be better than on the post road. At Firuzabad large quantities would be forth coming and rather less in the Khajal and Kavar villages. The harvest is gathered from the beginning of May to June, according to elevation. The water as far as Firuzabad is generally brackish, but sufficient drinking water for a regi ment should be obtainable. F'rom Firuzabad to Shiraz it is good and plentiful, though some wells are very deep and require long draw ropes. Grazing appears to be good generally. Fuel is fairly plentiful after the first two stages. Transport .—Mules are rare on this route; donkeys and camels in proportion of 10 to 1 are employed. Physical obstacles would be :—. (t) The Ahram river if in flood. (n) The Tang-i-Bahush, especially if there were much water in the bed. {in) Stage 5.

The Pulvar river becomes impassable for a day or two in (wet weather. The Quli-Kush pass is blocked by snow in winter, sometimes for 2 or 3 months Caravans then go round by Hanashk. Heavy snow often falls between December and March, and heavy ram also affects the passability of the road. The mid summer months are hot, but rarely excessively so. Large bodies of troops should not then march between 10 a. m. and 3 p.m. | Sivand and Murghab are feverish during the summer and autumn seasons. Animal sickness is often prevalent a^on^ the road. ° Supplies for a division would be obtainable at Shiraz and Isfahan for some time. It is calculated that 100,000 men and 25,000 animals, moving between Shiraz and Dehbid, could feed on the country without-drawing on the food supply of the inhabitants. Beyond this towards Isfahan the country is poor. Water is good and abundant at most stages, limited at a few, and brackish at stage 14. Fuel is scarce as far as Sivand, but could be collected with notice. Thence to Dehbid and Abadeh it is sufficient; but very scarce on to Yazd-i-Khast, where it is plentiful. At Qumi,shell it is procurable, and thence to Isfahan very scarce. From April to June there is good grazing between Shiraz and Dehbid for all animals. Camels find none from December to April. Transport consists of mules, camels, and donkeys. After notice at Qumisheh, 2,000 donkeys could be obtained, and at Mayar 2,000 camels. There are no physical obstacles of great importance for pack transport in ordinary seasons. For wheeled transport several detours are necessary.368 Kirman to Shlritz. j, Kirman Yazd. Stages 4, 5 and 6 are dangerous, in winter, on account of snow. 9. Kirman-Saidabad-Niriz-Shiraz, Volume III, 22, Total distance .— 334 miles in 16 stages. This is a main caravan route, suitable for camels, and, if widened and levelled, for guns. Up to Said at ad it runs through rather hilly country, and thence to Niriz across level desert with no obstacle. From Niriz to Khaiiabad the track is level or undulating, and mostly stony. Along the shores of Lake Nxriz, the ground would be soft in the rare event of very wet weather. &gt; In winter the cold is moderate. In summer from May onwards the heat is great, but the nights are fairly cool. There is little rain. Large quantities of supplies could be collected between Kirman and Saldabad, and beyond Niriz : in other places no thing much is obtainable. Nomads south of Lake Niriz own large flocks. Grazing is only sufficient for camels and donkeys, except between Khairabad and the Pulvar river, where grass remains green most of the summer. Water is plentiful everywhere, except at Khan-i-Khit where it is limited. Fuel is scarce except near Khan-i-Khit. 10. Kirman-Yazd by the post road, Volume III, 19. Total distance .—218 miles in 18 stages. This is the main route to Tehran, and roughly the line fol lowed by the telegraph. It is practicable for carriages through out, and runs for the whole distance down one of the great paral lel valleys trending north-west to south-east. The country is almost level, with a fairly salubrious and uniform climate. The heat is not excessive, in winter the cold is considerable, but snow only falls in January. Severe winds are experienced on the more exposed parts of the route. . Supplies in moderate quantities are obtainable throughout. The inhabitants keep large flocks of sheep and goats.

From Hormuz to Lar, water sufficient for a regiment and transport is obtainable from cisterns, sometimes dry in summer. At Lar the supply is unlimited. Chah Talkh is the only stage at which it is scanty. For transport, numbers of camels and mules could be collected at Bandar ’Abbas, 1,500 donkeys and 200 camels at Lar, and about 1,000 mules and 1,000 donkeys at Jahrum. Physical obstacles.—There; are five passes difficult for camels* especially in wet weather. Of these the Gardan-i-KnlTm is the worst. A tributary of the Kara Aghach river near Jahrum is impassable after heavy rain. Alternative routes are numerous ; the important ones are : L'mgeh to Lar. (a) via Jahrum and Fasa, which is valuable, being well supplied with provisions, though lateral communica tion is poor. (b) via Jahrum, Khaneh Kahdan, and Maharlu, with good supplies and lateral communication with the main route.

Total distance. —324 miles in 17 stages. It is a winter route, since it always remains open, and is most frequented during the rains, when the Tang-i-Za^h becomes dangerous. It is impassable for wheeled vehicles and is much more used for reaching Yazd than Kirman. In summer the lower stages are excessively hot and un healthy, but the higher parts would be quite tolerable for European troops. Snow falls in places, but never blocks the road. Bain may be expected from the end of November to the beginning of April, being heaviest in January. Supplies are more scarce than along any other route between Bandar Abbas and Kirman. It is probable that sufficient water would be found, even on the first part of the route, for say 2,000 men and their transport. Grazing as far as Saidabad, is comparatively scarce. Thence on there is no lack of camel grazing. During the rains there is good grass. Transport used is donkeys with a certain number of camels. Physical obstacles.—The Tang-i-Zagh (stage 6) is the worst place on the road, especially after heavy rains. Stages for troops are very long; supplementary halting places could only be arranged after enquiries as to the water available at the moment, on ahead. Alternative routes ,—See routes next following.372 Section IV. (S. E. Persia.) widar ’Abbas Kirman, vid 1. Baudar Abbas-Daulatabad-Baft-Kirmau, Volume IV, 143, is the main, caravan and postal route, but is liable to be closed by snow between December and March. Total distance :—270 miles in 18 stages. It is used by donkey caravans, and in spring and autumn by a few camels. To render it suitable for guns throughout would entail much labour. For rhe first four stages troops could move on a broad front. Stage 5 is only passable for cavalry in single file. Stages 5 to 9 are quite impracticable for guns, thence to Kirman guns could be taken. There are numerous rivers and water-courses throughout, which are difficult and sometimes impassable in wet weather for 24 hours at most. Some stages are liable to become boggy and slippery after rain. Fairly heavy showers may be expected in the coast plain during December and January, and light showers in November and February. In the upper parts of the road, rain falls from the middle of November to the middle of March and snow from the middle of December to the middle of March. In spring the streams are swollen from melting snow. Supplies .—In the lower parts of the road large quantities of dates are obtainable; wheat is scarce, barley fairly plentiful, the amount depending on the rainfall. Small quantities of supplies are found at most villages and large flocks of sheep and goats. Water is fairly abundant en route and at the halting places. There is no grazing in the coast plain from May to October. During the winter camel grazing is most abundant. On the highlands, camel grazing is found almost everywhere, though scanty in winter. Forage for mules might be found, but none for horses. The poisonous oleander is very common. Fuel in tho coast plain is everywhere scanty. Further on there are thorn bushes. Transport is mostly donkeys with a few camels in spring and autumn. Afghan camels come down only from January to March. Physical obstacles .—Stages 1 to 5 and 8 to 12 are slippery or even regular swamps in wet weather. The rivers between Baghu and Pariah'have sandy bottoms, which turn to quick-sands after rain. The Taftg-i-Zindan is extremely dangerous in wet weather. Sudden floods sometimes overwhelm whole caravans.

Bandar ’ Abbas-Minab-Rigan-ATasratabad Sipi-Sistan. Total distance .—526J miles in 28 stages. This is the main route from Bandar ’Abbls to Narmashlr SiSian and Afghanistan. It may be divided into two sections . , ^ Ba ndar ’Abbas-Minab-Rigan, Volume IV, 139, 2801 miles m 18 stages, is the easiest line from the southern coast 'to the ersianpIateau. At present it is impracticable for.wheeled traffic it is fully described in this chapter under heading “ Railways ” Tiom December to March there is snow on the higher parts of Bandar ’Abbas to Sistan Rigan. vidthe road, and on the Glshu pass over the Jabal Bariz range. In summer and even up to November the heat on the lower parts is excessive. The rainfall is as described above in No. 143. No supplies are obtainable till the fertile district of Narma- shir is reached. There are at least 1,000 cattle at Manujan and sheep and goats at eVery village. These would probably be driven off to the hills or desert on the approach of troops. Grazing for camels and donkeys is good throughout. On the whole there is no lack of bushes for fuel. VSater is generally good and abundant, but on a few stages is brackish or foul. _ Transport used is camels and donkeys. The camels are of light build, and could only carry on an average a load of 3£ ruaui*ds. Physical obstacles. —Stage 1 is liable to become a swamp after rain. The water-courses and Baghu and Minab rivers are subject to sudden floods, which make them difficult, dangerous or impassable, as the case may be. These floods subside with equal rapidity. The Kutal-i-Ginau and Gishu pass are difficult in their present condition. There are various alternative routes, of which that via Shamil, Khanu and Masitabad is useful when the road via Minab and Manujan is flooded. {ii) Rlgan-Nasratabad Sipi-Sistan, Volume IV, 70, 246 miles in 10 stages, is the main caravan route between south west Persia and Sistan. The Lut desert is entered at 19 miles and left some 80 miles further on. The track is passable throughout for guns, and easily convertible into an excellent cart-road, as the gradients are all easy. The section over the desert is not used from the beginning of June to the end of August, on account of the terrific heat. On the higher ground, from December to February, there is usually a light snow-fall. The rainy season is December to March. No supplies are obtainable en route, but the districts of Narma- shlr and Sistan, at either end, are very rich. Water is scarce till the Sistan plain is reached, and interme diate stages with water are impossible in the longer marches. It is brackish and scarce at stages 1, 2, 3 and 5, brackish but abundant at 6 and 7, good elsewhere.375 Camel-grazing is plentiful throughout, but grass is unob tainable. - Fuel is abundant, except at stages 2 and 10. There are no physical obstacles. 4. Jask-Kahn-i-’All-Khanu. Jashkto Khanu. Total distaice .—222J miles in 19 stages. This route connects Jask with the main roads to Kirman and Rigan. (i) Jask-Kahn-i-’ Ali, Volume IV, 135, 1721 miles in 15 stages, is the most direct-route to the north, but difficult even for camels in places. Stages 2 to 11 are through hilly and difficult country. The last four stages are fairly easy, except for a kutal just before Gashmiran. The Bandar ’Abbas-Rlgan road crosses at Kahn-i-’Ali. Supplies are nil, and water scarce, with none at all at stage 4. Camel-grazing is fair at stages 1 and 2, and excellent at 13, Elsewhere there is no information. About fuel there is no information. Physical obstacles. —Muddy estuaries in stage 1 are danger ous for camels. Stage 2 is difficult and the Charpar kutal barely practicable for camels. The Buhing Pass, stage 11, is very difficult, and the two next stages have some bad places. (ii) Kahn-i-’Ali-Khanu, Volume IV, 132, 50 miles in 4 stages, is a good camel track, practicable for wheels, except after rain. Large amounts of supplies are procurable at Khanu. At other places there'are none. . From Khanu, main routes run to Kirman and Rigan. Water is good and plentiful, except at Kahug'n where it is scanty. Camel-grazing is good generally, but limited at stage 2. 5. Galag-Bint, Volume IV, 98 A, is the easiest and most Galag to Bam. direct road inland, from the coast of Persian Makran, and is pur ’ m m ' passable for guns. It follows the course of the Rapch river throughout, and there are no obstacles to the passage of troops.Total distance .—61 miles in 4 stages. An important cross road (No. 108) connects Bint with Bampur via Fanuch, dis tance 116 miles in 6 stages. Supplies are scarce except at Bint. Camel-grazing is good, and fuel plentiful throughout, as is also water. 6. Chahbar-Qasrqand-Bampur, Volume IV, 45, is a main caravan route, but there is little trade, and it is only fit for camels. Total distance.—2211 miles in 15 stages. The first 53 r f miles are over low-lying coast border, easily made fit for wheeled traffic. The next 504 miles cross low, easy hills and tributaries of the Kaju river. After that, 86 miles up the bed of the Kaju rivei, with easy gradients but rough going over boulders. Then 17 miles over low hills and undulating ground, difficult for 5 miles. Thence on to Bampur, it is level and fit for wheels. The hot season is from the end of March to the end of Oc tober, and very trying and unhealthy for Europeans. At night mosquitoes make rest impossible without curtains. The cold season lasts the remainder of the year and is pleasant. Light snow occasionally falls in the higher regions, and rain is usual between January and March. With duo notice supplies for a brigade are obtainable at Chahbar, Qasrqand, Champ and Bampur. Water is abundant in the cold season. In the hot season thyro is always water in the Kaju river. Elsewhere it is good, and sufficient for a force with 500 animals at all stages. Camel-grazing is excellent throughout, but the poisonous oleander abounds about the Garreh Dap. Fuel is unlimited everywhere. Camels and donkeys only are employed for transport, and are obtainable in fair numbers. Physical obstacles. —Except the Tang-i-Hanzuk and the descent from the Gudar-i-Jangja, no serious obstacles to wheels exist. The Kaju river is impassable after heavy rain, but sel dom for more than 24 hours. The march up the river”would be very destructive to the boots of troops, and would lame horses and mules. An alternative route via Geh and Pib is 37 miles shorter, but more difficult, and water is not so good.7. Gwatar-Bahii Kalat-Sarbaz-Bampur. Total distance 230 miles in 18 stages, which may be describ ed in three sections :—• (i) Gwatar-Bahu Kalat, Volume IV, 23, is also part of the most direct route from Gwatar to Irafshan, (145 miles). It is fit for camels throughout, and for all arms in dry weather to stage 5, but suitable only for small bodies of troops. The country traversed is comparatively flat. * Distance .—50 miles in 5 stages. Supplies are nil; water is procurable in small quantities ; fuel and grazing are very doubtful. («) Bahu Kalat-Sarbaz, Volume IV, 33, is a good camel road, and fit for guns. It follows the Mazan Kaur river and is very stony. The Sarbaz and Hait defiles and other places are impassable after heavy rain. Distance .—93 miles in 8 stages. Supplies are procurable at stages 4, 5, 6 and 8. Water is abundant throughout. Grazing and fuel are good as far as Bafatan, scarce after wards. For transport, about 400 camels and 100 donkeys could be collected with difficulty along this route. [in) Sarbaz-Bampur, Volume IV, 32, is unfit for wheels, and presents some difficulties to camels. It follows the bed of the Sarbaz river and another stream to within 15 miles of Fehruj; the going is rough and stony, and the streams liable to flood. Some explosives would be useful in this section. The remaind er of the route is over the flat Bampur plain. Distance .—87 miles in 5 stages. v Supplies are nil between Sarbaz and Fehruj. At Fehruj find Bampur sufficient for a brigade should be procurable. Water towards the end of the dry season might be somewhat limited. In Bampur plain it is abundant. Grazing for camels is plentiful, and at place-i there is a certain amount of grass. Fuel is obtainable from shrubs 8. Purchinm Daf-Dizak-Gusht-Ladis-Robat (Kuh-i-Ma- lik Siah), Volume IV, 10, is part of the shortest and best route from Pasnl to Kuh-i-Malik Siah (about 450 miles in 30 singes); the first part lies in Baluchistan, vide southern Baluch* htan routes No^. 86 and. 111. Gwatar to Bam pur. Purchinan Daf to Itobat t i i Dizuk378 Bandar 'Abbas to Gwatar, along the coast. The total distance of the Persian section of the route is 322}- niiles in 21 stages. The section Purchinan Daf to Dizak, 74 miles, is important, being the shortest and easiest connection between Makran and the Diza'v valley, and all steep places are carefully ramped. Bam- pusht band range is crossed by an easy kutal ; other hills travers ed are low, but the road here is unfit for guns. Near the Kalgar kutal is a good signal station. From Dizak to Gusht the road is suitable throughout for wheeled traffic. From Gusht on is easy except stage 21, which is difficult, but fit for camels. There are no supplies except at Dizak. Water is generally plentiful, but scarce and indifferent at stage 7, brackish at 8, and undrink able at Kaur-i-Khar, 19. There is only one good alternative route. Gusht-Ladis vii Vasjit. This is 8| miles shorter with much better water-supply, but stage 2 is doubtful for guns. 9. Koutes along the coast. Bandar ’Abbas-Minab-Jask-Chahbvr-G &gt;vatar. Total distance. —471 miles in 34 stages. (t) Bandar ' Abbas-Minab is part of the main road to Rigan, No. 139, described in No. (3) of this series. Distance.—§&lt;6% miles in 5 stages. (n) Minab-Jask, Volume IV, 137, is generally over flat open plain, with the ground very soft and sandy in places. The marshy country is said to contain quicksands. The whole country would bo impassable after rains for a day or two. Distance. —137 miles in 11 stages. Supplies are practically nil. Water in summer might with care suffice for one battalion. It is slightly brackish in many places. Grazing and fuel are plentiful. (in) Jask-Chahbar, Volume IV, 97, is a good camel track in dry weather, and could easily be made fit for wheels. Distance. —205J miles in 14 stages. In wet weather it is impassable, owing to the clayey soil and the rivers and ndlds which rise very rapidly. The first 5 stages are over low-lying ground, the last 6 are flat and sandy. Supplie are sufficient for a small party, and water is generally very fair. Grazing is usually sufficient for a limited number of camels. Grans is scarce. Fuel is procurable.

It crosses a sandy plain to Ramin; 4 miles further it descends 200 feet: there are no difficulties. Supplies are not obtainable en route, but they are plentiful at Gwatar. The water-supply is fair, but generally brackish. Grazinq is plentiful. 10. Robat (Kuh-i-Malik Siah)-Nasratabad (SIstan), Volume Robat to Kas- IV, 8, is fit for all arms as far as Lutak. ratabad. Total distance .—115 miles in 7 stages. To Hurmuk (stage 2), it lies amongst winding nxlcis and the going is rough. Thence to Lutak is open desert. The remaining stages are over the well cultivated SIstan district with its numerous irrigation channels. Heavy rain, or snow, turns the whole country into a quagmire, impassable for camels, and so slippery as to be unsafe for horses. Juno to October is very hot; October to January dry and temperate; January to April cold and wet; April to June temperate. In January and February there are often dangerous blizzards. Large amounts of supplies are procurable in SIstan district; elsewhere practically nil. There would be very little difficulty for icater for a force not exceeding a brigade. Camel grazing is obtainable throughout, but for other ani mals grazing is scarce, except in SIstan. Fuel is obtained from thorn bushes. The length of the stages, and absence of grain mid fodder along the road preclude the use of an / transport animal, except the camel. The rough stony road to Hurmuk, and the irrigated SIstan land would be difficult for wheels, and the employment of cart transport hero would be neither eco nomical nor success ml. Noxious fi es abound in the hot weather Foie. — It may here be added that the Nushki-Robat trade The Xushki- route is 373 miles in 21 stages. It runs south of the Afghan- trad0 Baluch frontier; the greater part is straight, and level, and offers a fairly firm surface, except for certain stretches of soft sand from 1 to 2 miles. There are no obstacles to wheeled traffic, except as in the section Robat to Rasratabad. Here too the camel is the only suitable transport animal. Wells have been sunk and fortified posts established along the road. There is camel grazing practically everywhere along the road, but the380 waler-supply at some of the stages is still scanty and bad. During the cold weather, from November or December, till the end of February or beginning of March, there is generally suffi cient rain water to carry 2 brigades or more across the desert. Supplies even for small detachments cannot be relied on. The telegraph line follows this route. &gt; There is an alterna tive route from Nusliki to Nasratabad, via the Helmand. The river is reached at Ivhwaja ’All, Lundl A all, and Basabat by various tracks across the desert, which, though not devoid of serious difficulties for the march of troops, are practicable from February to May, when water is found in the depressions in the sand. The Sistan mission, 1,480 men, 156 horses and 2,250 camels travelled by some of those routes in 1003, but the season was exceptionally favourable. Along the bank of the Helmand from the above points to Chehar Burjak presents no difficulty, even for wheeled transport, and ivater and supplies are plentiful. The road to Nasrat abad follows the left bank to Band- i-Kamal Khan, and then strikes across the plain to Sehkuha. Here irrigation canals require bridging for guns otherwise the road is fit for all arms. The total distances by these. Helm md routes vary between 364 and 382 miles. 11. Bampur-Bazman-Bam-Kirman. Total distance .—3251 miles in 19 stages. (a) Bampur-Bazman-Bam, Volume IV, 114, is passable for all arms, except in stage 3, which is doubtful. Up to Chah Gaz the road lies over rocky and stony ground, but could easily be converted into a cart-road. Thence to Rigan is over the plain on the borders of the desert, and the going is good. Between Rigan and Bam cultivation and jungle occur, with no obstacles to wheeled transport. Between Bazman and Rigan the heat m summer is very great and quite unbearable for Furopeans. in winter the climate is good, and snow seldom falls. As a rule there is no snow between Rigan and Bam, but the summer is .ot and feverish. Distance- 2t)\l miles in 13 stages. Some of the stages are ,ng for troops, owing to lack of water at intermediate places. 'Supplies are obtainable at Bam, and very smaU quantities t Bazman. Thence to Rigan there is practically nothing.

( b) Bam-Kwman, Volume IV, 142. The post and telegraph road is alternative and avoids the difficult Kanaka Pass, which is sometimes blocked by snow in winter ; but water and supplies are scarce. The direct route crosses the pass and is 124 miles in (» stages. 12. Kir m an - Bir j and, there arc three routes :— (-T) Via Khabis and the desert, Volume IV, 89. Total distance. —276J miles in 13 stages. May be divided into two sections :— (' 1 Kirman - Khabis is a hill track passable by mules, darnels can only cross the pass in stage 2 with great difficulty'. Water is good and plentiful and a few supplies are obtainable.' {ii) Across the desert. After Khabis no water is obtainable, and no vegetation is to bo seen for over 100 miles. Camel kdfilehs alone use this route travelling night and day across the waterless tract with the briefest halts, even then it is only passable in winter. In summer the Bdd-i-Samum blows, and if encountered is almost certain death. In winter the cold is often intense, and there are violent hurricanes sometimes, ac companied by snow. (/?) Via Garmab and Haur across the Lut, Volume IV, 91, Total dist.ance.~2~3 miles in 10 stages. lid? iou.jO is extensively used by caravans in the winter mouths. In summer it is impossible owing to the intense heat; in winter the danger of a blizzard must be 'faced. One hundred and twenty-five miles are through the waterless stony Lut, where k is only fit for camels. The desert is a bare, gently rolling plain, covered with a hard surface of black shingle. The track is well marked in day light, but easily missed altogether at mght. At about 80 miles, a zone of kavir, some six miles wide and impassable after rain, is crossed. There are absolutely no supplies up to Haur; after that small quantities might bo collected. In the Lid no ivalcr exists. It must bo carried from382 Garmib. Abundant Sweetwater is readied at about 125 miles, on the Rud-i-Shirin, near Sar-i-Jangal. From tivo miles after leaving Garmab to Sar-i-Jangal, no grazing nor fuel are to be obtained. Thence onwards it is plentiful. (C) Via Ravar and Naiband, Volume IV, 93. Total distance. —295 miles in 15 stages. This is suitable for camel transport and field artillery. A kutal of 7,650' is crossed in stage 14, and stage 13 is sometimes closed by snow in winter. Supplies are very scarce. There are none at stages 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 11, but fair quantities at Ravar. Water is probably sufficient for two battalions. There is no water in stage 6, and the supply is uncertain at stages 4 and 11. It should be carried between A bid and Ravar, and Ravar and lS T aiband. The hauzes between (he stages are unreliable. Camel grazing is very scanty, except in stages 10 and 13. Fuel is scarce.

It w ist it was quic In 1889, as at ariousyear, Ru niiay concessio: we'd a prolon he years, or for ] ki a monopoly ns an equivalent Although at present Persia does not possess any railways except the small local line at Tehran, it appears certain that the whole future of the country, political and commercial, depends on railway construction. Lord Curzon traces this important matter, from its very commencement, briefly as follows : “ The preliminary obstacle is the configuration of the country, which would oblige any rail way, from the coast, to climb to the elevated plateau, upon which all the great cicies are placed; so that the cost of construction would bo hazardous to the pocket of either Government or the shareholders. The real obstacle, however, is not engineering difficulties; the question has been, and still is, one not of science bub of statesmanship.” Between 1865 and 1871, French, German, Austrian and English syndicates attempted unsuccessfully to work conces- sions. In 1872, the famous concession was granted to Baron do Reuter, for the immediate construction of a railway from the Caspian to the Persian Gulf, and also the monopoly of building other railways for 7 years. This concession was revoked ow ing to the hostility of Russia. Various other attempts followed with no better success; but in 1885, M.

See] Thesettlemen Jfeureisrende ^questions: ‘Wieipationby383 of railway concessions, the chief of which was a line from Rasht to the Capital, and, afterwards, thence to Bushire. All his projects failed, except the construction of the small railway from Tehran to the shrine of Shah Abdul ’Azim, about six miles south of the city, which was opened in July 1888. At the present day this is the only railway in Persia. It is wmrked by a B; Igian company, and is connected by two short branch lines, each 2i miles long, with some limestone quarries near the city. The gauge is one metre. A second railway was constructed from the roadstead of Mahmudabad on the Caspian to Amu!, the result of native enterprise. It w r as so badly constructed and run, however, that it was quickly abandoned. In 1889, as an equivalent to the Karim concession of the previous year, Russia obtained from the Shah the refusal of any railway concession in Persia for five years. In 1890, Russia secure'd a prolongation of the railroad prohibition for another five years, or for 10 years in all from 12th November 1890 and also a monopoly of all construction in northern Persia. This was an equivalent for the British successes in the matter of the Imperial Bank Mining Corporation, and Tobacco R ' j gie. Finally Russia extracted from the Persian Government an undertaking to give no railway concession before the end of 1910. As far as Great Britain was concerned with railways at this period, Nasr- ud-Dln Shah gave her a pledge, 16th September 1888, that she should have priority over others in construction of southern railways and also a jmsitive assurance that, without consulting her, no southern railway would be granted to a foreign country. This wording would justify her in asking to be allowed to con struct a railway in southern Persia, should she desire to do so, in the event of Russia obtaining a concession to construct one in the north. See page 32. By the Anglo-Russian arnangement of 1907, the Russian Government undertook not to oppose concessions supported by the British Government in the British sphere, nor, without pre vious discussion with the British Government, in the neutral zone either. See page 32. The settlement of schemes for the construction of railways in Possibilities of the future is rendered difficult by the important strategical and 111 tha political questions involved, and especially by possible attempts at participation by powers other than Great Britain and Russia.Another difficulty is to find the necessary capital; Persia is quite incapable of producing it, the Russian Government has none to spare for the purpose unless strong political reasons exist, while British and Russian capitalists naturally require some guarantee. To enumerate the possible alignments for railways, it will be convenient to commence with the older Russian projects from the north. These are as follows :— (a) Julfa-TabrR-Tehran.—This project is distinctly Rus sian, and only Russian commerce would benefit. This scheme now forms part of an Anglo-Russian one from Julfa to Mu- hammareh il i Tehran and Ramadan, which will be mentioned later. Should this line be constructed, Russia hopes that British and German trade would be diverted from Trebizond to Batoum. Railway construction between Trebizond and Tabriz concerns the Turkish Government, but Trebizond could not compete with Batoum, unless connected by rail with Tabriz and the route is of great importance to Persia ; Russia is believed to object to a railway thence on strategical grounds. In 188(1 Batoum ceased to be a free port, and Russia has not proposed to make it one, should the railway be realised. The Russians have connected Julfa, the southern terminus of their Trans-Caucasian railway system, with Tabriz, by means of a road so constructed that, if required, a railway can be laid on it. (i) Baku-Rasht-Tehran. Baku is directly connected with Moscow by rail, but the Caucasus, crossed north of Tiflh by an excellent road at the Dareil pass, is unlikely ever to be traversed 1 here by a railway. Baku, therefore, has been considered by (he Russians preferable to Tiflis as a starting point, and a particular ly fine station was constructed some years ago at Adji Kabul miles south-west of Baku, with a view to a possible extension along the western sRore of the Caspian to Rasht and thence to Tehran. Probably, from the Russian point of view, the fact that the Jnlfa-Tabriz line is within reach of the Turkish frontier, while this line is more secure, earned it to be regarded with favour. The engineering difficulties would be considerable and expensive. (c) Askhabad-Kuchin-Meshed.—The Russians have con structed a road here across their frontier to KCichan, but the zig-385 Mgs by which the ridges are surmounted, in their present condi- ion are quite impracticable for a railway. From Kflchfa to Meshed is a level plain. J m -tvucnan to ,, ( d l Dushakh or Tejen or Merv to Sarakhs-Mazdaran nass Meshed. This offes a circuitous but very easy means of linking the Trans-Caspian railway with Meshed. The natural sequencf would be an extension to Slstan, Kirman, or a southern sea port. As ^is, and the previous project, are calculated to arouse the susceptibilities of the Afghans, they are not likely to be nur A CrV t0 Sarakhs is 81 milea level desert woddt S e it£ 7 do“s e t.y h0rt&lt;&gt;8t ^ Vi£tb ° Km (e) Tehran-Meshed.-The physical obstacles here are in- irexcent’for tl Undertakin 8 is not ^ ^ be profitable, as, except for the grain-producmg areas between Tehran and Shahrud, the country is unproductive. (/) Baghdad-Khaniqin-Hamadan-Tehran.—The oldest and most discussed project of any in Persia. The kutals here are much easier than further south, but would be costly to surmount The only really difficult section would be from As’adabad to hamadan, a distance of about 18 miles. Pal Taq to Sur Kha- dizar, about 6 miles, is also difficult, for here the ascent of the steep Zagros range is made. The difference in level of the two ThTp-'L-S ^M^o 110 shouId bo commercially profitable, the Baghdad Railway Syndicate holds the right of laying a branch line m Turkish territory from Sadiyeh, 20 to 30 miles above Baghdad on the Tigris, to Khaniqln. (g) Julfa, Baku, or Enzali to Tehran, thence to Yazd, di rect or wd Isfahan, continuing on to Kirman, thence to join the Indian railway system, or to a southern sea-port. This is the proposed Trans-Persian railway, and, from an engineering point ot view, there are few difficulties in its construction. The other possible railways are the British ones («) Muhammareh-Dizful (164 miles)-Khurramabad-Buru- jird-Uamadan. From Muhammareh to Dizful there are two possible routes, due first leaves Ahwaz to the east, and touches Kut Nahr ilasfiim. The second follows the west bank of the Karun to Aminiyeh opposite Ahw&amp;z, thence direct to Dizful ; the latter is longer by 10 miles (174 miles). This sectioa would be easy386 to construct, and an estimate gives the cost at about £3,000 per mile, £500,000 to Dizful. Fuel would be obtainable from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s refinery. The country tra versed, if developed by an extensive irrigation scheme, would yield an extraordinarily rich harvest. From Dizful to Khurramabad, the country has not yet been accurately surveyed. It is mountainous, cut up by deep ravines and reported comparatively easy, except for about 50 miles where the elevations reach 6,000. It is liable to a little snow in the winter months. The inhabitants are Lfir tribes, notoriously lawless, but it is quite possible that an arrange ment could be made rvith their chiefs, and remunerative employ ment on railway construction would pacify them. Construc tion on this section would be costly, even with heavy gradients and narrow gauge. This scheme now forms part of a larger one connecting with a Russian railway from Julfa to Hamadan vid Kazvln; thus forming a complete system from Julfa to Muham- mareh. (5) Bandar ’Abbas-Minab-Rigan-Kirman. This is said to be the easiest alignment, for a cart road or railway, from the coast on to the main plateau of Persia. It was specially sur veyed for this purpose in 1905, with the following result. First 66 miles level, 62 miles up the course of Minab river, 13 miles over low hills and the Ginau pass 1,370', 63J miles level plain, 30£ miles over the Jabal BarTz range by the Gishu kutal, 3,160 '; 42£ remaining miles to Rigan practically level. The only part that would present any obstacle to construction is about the Gishu kutal; in its present condition it is impassable to wheels. Rigan to Kirman presents no difficulties. A rough estimate puts the cost for construction and rolling stock as far as Rigan at £2,410,000. The Newcomen commercial mission expressed an opinion that, under present conditions, neither this nor any other line in Persia would pay, unless the produc tion, population, and trade of the country were at least doubled. (c) From Bandar ’Abbas via Shiraz to Ahwaz or Muhain- mareh. Sir F. Goldsmid proposed two routes, the northerly one Yazd. Present opinion, however, seems to favour a line vid jnwztoLSr, toSliiraz.

From Jahrum to Fasa the country is extremely open and easy. From Fasa to Lake Niriz, by the Tang-i-Karun presents no difficulty, the gradients being insignificant. An easy main route runs along the lake shore, but there is one steep descent to Shiraz. It is probable that this line would have to pass north or Lar, for that place has high hills just north of it and the only exit in that direction is over a pass 800'high. The province of Laristan is the poorest and least productive in Persia ; the inhabitants are not accustomed to Europeans as few ever go there. The Qashqai tribe would be met with from near Firuzabad northwards. The other section is from Shirlz to Ahwaz or Muhammareb touching, if desired, a Gulf port en route. There are two ports available, first Khur Musa, the country around which is level and easy, but the approaches to the harbour very swampy ; the other is Bandar Dilam. From the latter place to Shiraz,Lieu tenant Hopkins, R.E., reported a quite feasible lino following the Fahlian river by a continuous easy ascent. There is one difficult place, a pass, 7,200', about 30 miles from Shiraz. The distance between Bandar Dilam and Shiraz is about 210 miles, the country traversed is well watered and timbered. The inhabi tants are predatory tribes. Lieutenant Hopkins also reported that the route on from Shiraz to Kirman was quite easy and practicable. (d) Bushire-Shiraz. This is quite impracticable by the post road (180 miles), but urn Firuzabad (200 miles) there are fewer physical obstacles to be encountered. The direction of the line here would, however, cut across the main trend of the mountains, which are a succession of parallel ridges with a uniform trend of north-west to south-east. In view of Bushiro being an old established and important sea-port, with monej^ invested there, a scheme has been suggested for connecting it by rail with the proposed line from Bandar ’Abbas to Shiraz at ’Aliabad, some 25 miles south-east of Jahrum. Little is known about the country that would be traversed. An alternative line might be found from Bushire to Bandar Dilam, and thence to Shiraz as above described. ThL coast belt is perfectly fiat but liable to inundation. (e) Chahbar-Bampur (220 miles) was reported on (1906) as on the whole unsuitable for the alignment of a railway as its388 construction would be an undertaking involving great expense. As a means of reaching the Central Persian plateau, this route possesses no advantages over that from Bandar ’Abbas to Rigan. tion with Indian . The possible lines for connecting future Persian railways railways. with the existing Indian ones are :— (a) Prom Kirman via Slstan or Robit to I\ushki. This line would have to cross two great deserts before reaching the present railway terminus at Nushki. Apart from any other consideration this line is strategically undesirable, (b) Kirman-Bampur-Panjgur-Las Bela-Karachi. (c) Kirman-Bampur-Sarbaz-Kej to a port in British Balu chistan or to Karachi. . (&amp;) and (c) are fairly accessible from the sea, and a more profitable country is traversed than in (a), but the direct line from Panjgur to Las Bela cuts across the trend of the mountains. The Russian Staff Captain, P. A. Rittich, made an explora tion across Persia to Baluchistan in 1900, under the orders of the Russian Government, for the purpose of investigating proposed lines of railway. He reported, and prepared estimates on three alignments, starting from the station of Allat of the Baku-Tiflis railway, and proceeding to Tehran via Rasht and Kazvln. Prom Tehran his proposed routes were :— (a) Isfahan-Shlraz-Bushire, avoiding the bad southern kutals by following the course of the Hand river and then the coast line. (b) As in (a) to Shiraz, thence via the Mand river to ’Aliabad, and thence via Lar to Bandar ’Abbas. (c) Tehran-Kashan-Yazd-Kirman-Chahbar. Among schemes for connecting Meshed with Trans-Caucasia, he was strongly in favour of a line Kushk-Meshed, and further advocated an extension southwards from either of these places along the Sistan and Baluchistan frontiers to the Arabian Sea. Inland Water Communications. Inland water The Karun river, already described (Chapter III,) offers the comnranica. only means of inland water communication in Persia. Its value is rather discounted by its tortuous windings, by the rapids at Ahwaz, which divide the river into two sections and necessitate a break of bulk at Bandar Nasiri, and owing to specially con- sgtecl boats bi a as far as Ban fa! point, moreo jlfiz, owing to t ts of the watei kpfer VIII.)

Boats which can work as far as that point, moreover, are unsuitable for the reaches above Ahwaz, owing to the sharpness of the bends, and the shallow- ness of the water there. (Bor details of river steamers see Chapter VIII.) Band-i-Qlr is considered the point at which the river will probably cease to have any military value as a means of communication. Native craft capable of taking 10 to 25 tons, are sometimes sailed and sometimes towed up stream, even beyond Ahwaz. The banks are in some places level with, and in others 30' above the water and unfavourable for towing, which is always done by men and not animals. The only value of the Karun above the rapids may lie in its utilization for the transport of grain and supplies, from Bizfiil and Shushtar to Ahwaz. For this purpose native craft or rafts might bo employed and floated down by the current. The facilities of the Karun river for transport purposes vould no doubt bo useful, in the early stages of military operations, for the establishment of advanced posts and supply depots, and, to a certain extent, for the transport of troops as far as Ahwaz. It might be found more profitable, however, to lay a light railway along one of the banks, according to the direction in vhich the force was required to act. For water communication between Enzali and Rasht see Chapter VIII. Communications by Sea. On the Caspian none but Russian steamers are allowed. The Caucasus and Mercury Company run postal steamers, weekly in summer, to the principal ports’. In winter, when the Volga is closed, the service is fortnightly, with an extra boat for cargo every alternate week. the Persian Gulf, the shipping is almost entirely British.. The most important line is the British India Sffeam Navigation Company which has a weekly mail contract between Karachi and the Gulf Ports. Other important British lines trading here are the Bombay and Persia Steam Navigation Company, the Anglo-Algerian Company, Messrs. Bucknall Brothers, and the West Hartlepool Company.390 In 1903, tho Russian Steam Navigation Company of Odessa started a service of four ships a year to tho Persian Gulf. Tho Russian Government granted thorn an annual subsidy of 200,000 roubles, which is to be paid for 10 years in all. The Company established agents at Basrah, Muhammareh and Bushire. In October 1906, the German Hamburg- Amerika line com menced a service between Hamburg and the following ports:— Masqat, Bandar’Abbas, Lingeh, Bahrain, Bushiro and Muham mareh. For the first two years the number of sailings was thirteen and twelve respectively, but from 1908-1909 only 8 steamers of the Company, and one Danish steamer chartered by them, visited the Gulf Ports, owing to depression in trade. There was a corresponding decrease in British shipping also at this time. Tho Hamburg-Amerika Agents have publicly denied that they are receiving any subsidies whatsoever from the German Govern ment. The operations of the line seem interdependent with those of the German firm of Messrs. Wonckhaus and Company, who previously, about 1903, estab ished themselves at Ba rah, Bahrain and Lingeh, and thence extended their branches to other ports after the advent of the German steamers. It is said that these ships are being run at a loss. Their agent at Muham mareh is an Armenian, but a a European agent, a Hollander, lives at Ahwaz. Sugar and oil are the chief items of cargo of the German steamers, imported to Persia, and the bulk of cargo h shipped at Antwerp. Telegraphs. Telegraphs. Persia has a system of telegraphs, returned, in 1909, at 6 590 miles of line, with 10,908 miles of wire and 129 stations. These lines are classed under four separate headings . (a) Those worked by an English Staff forming the “Indo- European Telegraph Department in Persia.” This is a British Government Department, established m virtue of a number of conventions, from 1863 to 1901, between the British and Persian Governments. The last convention was for the construction and working, by the British Government, of a 3 wire line from. wi Yazd, ^ling there w ^iion with Ini j]jj is known smeted under t ia cost was d is wires is at 1 * of local ad lines in Persi i, Chief station iiiBn-Gula’iek irin-Kashitn (iline). irin-Sishan (mw line).

Telegraphic com munication with India by this route was effected in May 1904. This line is known as the Central Persian Telegraph. It was constructed under the supervision of the British telegraph staff, and the cost was defrayed by the British Government. One of the wires is at the disposal of the Persian authorities for purposes of local administration. Lines in Persia of the Indo-European Telegraph Depart ment.

(b) The Indo-European Telegraph Company Limited. This must not be confused with the above mentioned Department. By a concession, dating from 18GS, this Company works a une of 415 miles, with three wires and 6 stations, between lekranand Julfa on the Russo-Persian frontier. From Julfa the line is carried, via Kertch, across Europe, thus connecting with London. This Company obtained a renewal of their telegra phic concessions to 1945, and by Article 3 of their agreement with the Persian Government, dated 12th August, 1882, they would have the right to take over the Tehran-Bushire line, if the British Concession for the line were ended. The British Government treaty has been renewed under an agreement, dated 7th January 1892, for a period ending the 31st January 1925. (c) Persian Government lines maintained by the Indo-Euro pean Telegraph Department. This at present consists only of the line from Tehran to Meshed, 568 miles with 10 stations and a single wire, except from Tehran to Shahrud which is double. It is hoped that the Majlis will consent to the Department taking over the reconstruction and control, up to 1945, of the lines Borazjun-Ahwaz, Dizffil-Muhammareh. The construction of a line connecting Kuh-i-MBik Siah with Nasratabad (Siskin), under similar control, may also be agreed to. A suggested arrangement is the exchange with Russia of the control 'of the Tehran-Meshed line for that of the Khaf-Nasratabad line. There are certain British rights over the Tehran-Khanqiin line which might have to be relinquished to facilitate this. (d) Lines belonging to the Persian Government and worked by a 1 ersian Staff. There are 2b of these lines, each consistin 0, of a single wire. The total length of the various lines is 3 732 miles with 88 stations. The principal stations are :— . _ .Tehran, Kazvin, Astara, Rasht, Khurramabad, Tabriz Sauj Bulagh, Marand, Urumieh, Pul-i-Saveh, Ardabil, Khani- qln, Hamadan, Burujird, Nahavand, Sinneh, Qurveh, Briar Daulatabad, Qum, Meshed, Nasratabad (Sistan), Sarakhs, Lut- fabad : Kuchan, Bajglran (and Askhabad), Bujnurd, Shahrud Astarabad, Chatli, Chikishliar, Samnan, Flruzkuh, Mashad-i-Sar' Borazjun, Dizful, Aliwaz, Muhammareh, Isfahan, Nam, Bandar ‘Abbas, Han jam. JVote.-~lhe line Meshed to Nasratabad (Sistan) was cm menced by the Persian Government in 1902, and finished December 1903. ^ The work was supervised by Russh engineers, and consists of a single wire on wooden poles.

Notes. *A concession, obtained in 1868, conferred the right to erect telegraph buildings on Hanjam, and considerable sums were expended by the Indo-European Telegraph Department in build ing water tanks and other improvements. In April 1904 a British telegraph station was re-established at the north end of the island, after having been in abeyance for 13 years. The Staff here consists of an Assistant Superintendent and 2 clerks. f From Fao, the Turkish Government line connects with Europe, tnd Basrah, Baghdad, Mosul, Diarbekr, Sivas and Con stantinople. Thence via Vienna, Munich, Strasburg, and Paris to London. $ The diversion from Hanjam to Bandar 'Abbas via Qishm was constructed for the Persian Government by the Indo-Euro- pem Telegraph Department, and opened for traffic dur ng 1906. There was some trouble over the question of the positions of the cable house and telegraph office at Bandar ’Abbas; the Persian Government, however, agreed to allow the British Con sulate there to be connected with the line by a private wire.394 Wireless telegraphy in the Persian On If. Postal System. The great advantage of the establishment of wireless tele- grap ! i stations in the Persian Gulf came prominently info notice in connection with the suppression of the arms traffic there. At the endof 1909, a temporary wireless station was established at Jask. The estimated land radius of action was put at 300 miles, but ships were picked up at sea at a distance of about 2,000 miles by night. Owing to financial and other reas ms little more has up to the present been effected. The full scheme suggested included stations at Bushire, Bahrain, Dibai, (or Zotra) Kuwait andLingeh, with inter-communication among them all and with the Indian system. A range of 200 miles was esti mated as sufficient for these stations, except at Lingeh and Bushire, where 300-mile ranges arc necessary owing to the dis tance between the two places. It is considered that these greater stations should be fitted for a normal working wave length of 600 metres, but with a capacity for transmission of wave length up to 803 metres and capable of receiving any wave length of 600 metres and over, in order to suit naval systems. A later and less comprehensive scheme advocates tempor ary stations at Bushire, Bahrain and Bibai (or Zora) for the pur pose of coping more effectively with the arms traffic. Hanjam and Basldu had previously been suggested as possible stations. Other proposals also are under consideration. Atmospheric conditions in the Persian Gulf frequently in - terfere with wireless telegraphy. These conditions are com mon to the whole of the Persian Gulf, which, especially in the autumn, is subject to a curious species of electric storm. Ac cording to the Chief Electrician of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, so far as he has been able to ascertain, this pheno menon is peculiar to the Persian Gulf. Occasionally, on dark nights, the electric storm is distinctly visible, and ' has been described as successive waves of light, smoke, or mist driven over the sea. The actual Avay it affects wireless telegraphy is not yet known. The first regular postal service was established by an Aus trian official in Persian employ, and opened in January 18i77. Under it, mails are regularly conveyed to and from the principal cities in Persia. As regards communication with other coun tries, there is a service twice a week to and from Europe, vti ftasht, or vi4 Tabriz and Tiflis (letters to be marked via Russia).
