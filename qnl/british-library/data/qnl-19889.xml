We have never answered this letter officially, though we have been on the point of doing so several times and we have had a good deal of inconclusive correspondence with India and the Gulf on the subject with copies of wnich I need not trouble you. It now seemsthat the problem has receded into the background, but it may be well if I summarise the position as it appears to us at present. We are all now agreed that nothing effective can be done on behalf of Bahreinis who have acquired Persian nationality by virtue of the Persian Nationality Law, but there is still a category, probably a small one, of Bahreinis who do not fall within the scope of the Persian Nationality Law (viz. presumably, Bahreinis born in Bahrein who possess no land in Persia). In regard to these the India Office view still is that it is desirable to protest ir cases of ill-treatment if only to avoid the appearance of acquiescing in the Persian claim to Bahrein. The question of backing such protests (which, by themselves, are litcely to be unavailing) by retaliatory action has been considered at some length with the Government of India and the Resident and no very satisfactory suggestions have emerged. The only two suggestions which still/ (Copy sent to Bahrain under P.L.NO^^-S • Baggallay, jfisq., .our p«X»No«-3f^ r '-»B ^reign Office, S.W.I. of «6-4~3ft. A e&lt;- vp'l ( OOPY SENT TO.still appear to hold the field, and on which we do not know the Resident * s final views, are (a) a scheme for cringing Persian schools under the control of the Bahrein Educational Authorities (a scheme which may, in any case, be desirable on administrative grounds), and (b) a suggestion that persecuted Bahreinis should be removed from Persia and settled on the west side of Bahrein where, apparently, there is vacant space. On this, however, the question arises whether even persecuted Bahreinis in fact wish to leave Persia. This is as far as we have got up to the present. But it would now appear, e.g. from Ahwaz Despatch to Tehran Vo.21 ^ dated 22nd April, 1935, that there is quite a good chance of no further trouble arising in this connection. We are therefore proposing to do no more at present unless Fowle, with whom we intend to discuss the matter when he comes to London, has any suggestions or views. The question of a Nationality Lav/ for Bahrein which has come into this discussion is, of course, a separate matter and is, I believe, being dealt with on your side by Ward at the moment. Yours sincerely, ( Sgd. ) M. J. CLAU SOls.Mr. Glauson Aa. &lt; o - 2 sr. fix. ?&amp;/ I note that the Foreign 0 Office (vide the enclosure to their letter of 30th August) do not disagree with clauses 1-4vard in paragraph 3 of my express letter of 2 _ _ii, as far as these points go, but are of opinion that they need a good deal of expansion. So far so good. With regard to clause 5, they also see no objection in principle (vide enclosure already referred to) but think that this should be dealt with not in the nationality law itself, but in a separate one to be published. I should have thought that the retaliatory side of this clause vis a vis the Persians would have been less obvious if published as part of the law, and not separately, but so long as it takes form somehow or other I am quite content. 2. With regard to the objection contained in Foreign Office letter of 30th August to my suggestion re raising the registration fee as against foreigners. The danger of mass registration of Persians, which I mentioned, is a real one, and some preventative must be /be devised. As the Foreign Office object to my solution they might be asked to put forward one of their ov/n. 3. With regard to the position of the Saudis under clause 5, referred to in the Note of 2nd August, if the Saudi Government penalize foreigners (including Bahreinis) in the matter of holding property in Saudi Arabia they cannot complain if Saudi subjects are similarly treated in Bahrein. T.G.FCMLE. 9.9.35.af/'o ? ±}y Air Mail dr INDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL, S.W.I. 11th October 1935. r With reference to the discussion at the Foreign Office yesterday which you attended about the proposed Nationality Law for Bahrein, I enclose herewith copy of the draft Bahrein Nationality Law in the fom in which it emerged from our discussion, together with a copy for your records of Ward's letter to me of 3Cth August last (l\ T o.E. 4931/762/91) with its enclosures. With reference to Article 5 of the draft Law, you pointed out that there might be serious objections to allowing the Sheikh of Bahrein the unfettered right to make and unmake Bahrein nationals, for example in the case of British subjects, ejid it was agreed that Article 5 should be subject to an exchange of letters between the Political Agent and the Sheikh of Bahrein, in which the Sheikh would agree not to exercise his powers under this Article without the previous consent of the Political Agent. ie Hon'ble Lt .Col . T. C . Fowle , CBE. , The Residency, Bushire. 2.//T 8 - 2. You will remember that Beckett made it clear that if the Political Agent is to charge fees for registration under Article 2 of the draft Law it will be necessary to provide for this by Order in Council. The Foreign Office pointed out the objections to laying dov.r. in an Order in Council a differential registration fee for foreigners as opposed to British subjects, and Beckett suggested that registration for the purposes of the Bahrein Nationality Law which would be non-recurrent should be kept entirely separate from the present annual routine registration of British subjects under the Order in Council, and that the former registration should be applied to British subjects born in Bahrein as well as to persons of other nationalities on exactly the same terns. Beckett suggested that an amending Order in Council should be passed which might be somewhat on the following terms:- 'The Political Agent shall keep a register of persons entitled to register with him for the purposes of Articles 1 and 2 of the Bahrein Nationality Law. Each registration shall be subject to a fee of x rupees.' You emphasized the importance of charging a fairly high f ee/xe© for r6gistration for this purpose in ord6r to deter persons born in Bahrein of Persian extraction from registering en masse at the Political Agency, thus divesting themselves of Bahrein nationality. It was agreed that you should ascertain from Loch the approximate number of British subjects and protected persons born in Bahrein who would be affected if an amending Order in Council were issued on the lines suggested by Beckett, and that you should then let us have your views on the whole question in the light of your discussion with Loch. 3. It has been generally agreed that simultaneously with the enactment of the Bahrein Nationality Law a law should be enacted providing that foreigners whose Governments prohibit the ownership of immovable property by persons other than their own nationals may be prohibited from owning immovable property in Bahrein. I am afraid that I am not yet in apposition at present to let you have a draft for this law, since we find that it will require a good deal of further consideration here. We shall l6t you have a draft of this law as soon as possible. 4. You will remember that Ueckett also suggested that the Bahrein Order in Council should be re -amended so/oa 4. so as to provide for the annual routine registration by the Political Agent of all persons subject to his jurisdiction and not merely of British subjects as at present. It was agreed, however, that the consideration of this proposal should be deferred until a year at any rate has been allowed to elapse from the date of the enactment of the Bahrein Nationality Law. It should then be possible to observe the effects of the Nationality Law and to calculate the number of additional persons who would have to be registered by the Political Agent if Beckett's proposal were adopted. 5. With regard to the proposal to undertake a complete revision of the Bahrein Order in Council the Foreign Office, in deference to the views expressed by Loch and by the Government of India, agreed not to press this proposal for the present, but they expressed the opinion that it was desirable that the task should be taken in hand within the next year or two, 6.

Through the operation of aost-fawoured- nation clnuses Article 5 becaae the charter for all foreigners In Persia to own property for their own re idential nnd business purposes, (but for no other). 5m The general prohibition seen* to have been disregarded, however, and on January 29th, 1931, the » er ; lan Government felt it neceBsary to pans a law requiring U foreigners to dispose of their agricultural property (see K (1931)* This law only gave the foreigner three nonths in which to do so, but contained 1 guards (in theory at any rate) to ensure that he received a proper price. 6* The position of Persisne In Bahrain is different frow that of Bahralnls In Persia, In that the former will have some choice as to their nationality and the latter have had none (but have at the same time had no &lt;Uftlcuity about seeping their property if they accepted the outward and visible signs of Persian nationality). But It would be fair that such Persians as elect to retain their own nationality under the new Bahralnl nationality law juld be fillowed to dispose of their real property on terms more/1/201.0/ 19j1) more or lose sinllar to thoae of the Persian law of January 29th 1931* ^ There la one apparent precedent which Right be regarded aa a reaaon for granting lets feT curable terras than those of the law of January P9th t 1931» to the Persians in Hahrainy i.e. the treatment of certain British subjects who haws been required of late to dispose of their real property in Persia* But the precedent ia not a true one and it is therefore desirable to explain the clrcuBetancea of these cases t if only to dispose of thens 7^7*3 011 7th 1929f the Persian Goremment 7 ii&gt;\ , 1 , intoduced a new nationality law which» with supplenentary articles passed on October 21st 1930t provided that certaia persons who were Peraian subjects under the new law f but had hitherto been foreign subjects» could opt for their foreign nationality within one year from the passing of the supplementary articles* Thoae who did bo were subjected to no penalties as regards any real property they might possess within the limits allowed by Persian law* Many British subjects omitted, however, through Ignorance or ineptitude to take the neceasary steps to divest themselves of their Persian nationality within the prescribed period and after much discussion the Persisn Government agreed at the end of 1932 to grant a further period of g race during which such British subjects might shed their Persian nationality* 9* The Persian Oovernment insisted, however, that this change of nstionality should take place, not under/under those articles of the law which were originallx applicable to the Britlah auhjecta in question (and und® r ilch they would have been free to choose either Persian or British nationality and to have kept their property) 9 but under the article (Article XIII) applicable to natural-bom Persian subjects who wish for any reason to acquire a foreign nationality. one of the conditions attached to the acceptance of applications under this article is that the person concerned shall dispose of his real property to Persian subjects within a period of one year, even if such property cen be held by other foreigners (e.g* for residential and business purposes)* This iu a longer period than was allowed in the lew of January 29tht 1931» but there are on the other hand no safeguards for the owners* interests. The Persian Qovernnent declined to waive this condition in the case of the British subjects who proposed to take advantage of the period of grace» but there can be no doubt that they were within their legal rights in doing so and that there ia no real coaparieon between the Persians now in Bahrain fnd those British subjects who were obliged through their own dilatorlness to appeal Tor leave to dlveet themeelye b of their Persian nationality under Article XIII.GONJJDEJTJAU NO* 820*3 of 1935• Brl tleh Kealdenoy and Consulate oeneralt itoehlre, the 31 at ootober 1935 To Ae Polltlqal A^flrit» Bahrain* fhofosed XAnomLlTY Keferenct paragraph 2 of India Office letter dated the 11 th uotober 1935f oopy sent to you direct* ATTSQ'£KD % for in the Persian uulf• te'A* Please let me know the apt roximate fiuriber of British subjects and protected persons born in Bahrain who would be afiected if an amending Order in council were issued on the lines sueeted. cr^t^ry io the Political Residentientifil 7 GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. —.—- Depar tment.

An high ^ee might bear hardly on poor British subjects and protected persons and it is desirable to avoid hardship to them without c iscrimination against other foreigners# ^ 1 venture to suggest the following device for prevent ing Hardship to British subjects and protected persons (and £-so to other foreigners in Bahrain) while making it possible to impose a heavy fee for registration as a foreign subject under r the provisions of the proposed Bahrain Nstionelity Law. All British subjects may (voluntarily) register the births of their children under King*3 Regulation No:i of J 00 (The Births, Teaths and Marriages Regulation 1925) under the Bahrain 0rder-in-(5ouncil. It is not clear, however, whether the term British subject includes British protected persons. 'The Births, Teaths and Marriages Registration Act, 1886' speaks only of - - lo subjects, but in the definition of 'British subject' - the Bahrain rder-in-Council, it includes British protected person. r erson€-ly I should interpret the position as being -iau or the purposes of Bahrain British protected persons are included. 5. In any case, foreigners (i.e., persons other than Bfhrain subjects) may register the births of their children in a egister kept in the Agency and a few (American, 'Iraqis and so on) have done so. No Persians have done so as they hold /Bahrain3. ahroin uo c s part of D ersia, so do not register as foreigners though tncy ?1 accept the position of foreigner for the purpose of recourse to the Agency c ourts.

It would be essential to keep the procedure suggested in paragrapns 6 and ? above confidential as otherwise there ■.ould be likely to be a rush of applicants to register in the Agency betveen the time that the proposals become known and the oime that the Bahrain Nationality Law comes into force. ;-Colonel D olitical Agent, Bahrain,GOVERNMENT OF (ND!A. confidential .

Consequently in Bahrain it includes the Political Agent. The Secretary f State's regulations have been made In 1930 and amended in 19X (Statut e* Rules and Orders 1950 S*» T40, and 1052 Ho. 636). These regulationa apply in Bahrain but it Is important to n&gt;tice that they apply only to British subjects, not to British Protected Person^. It is important that the Political Agents t Bahrain and elsev/^ero should be aware of these regulations beeaiise in s me cases the title of an individual, to be a British subject depends urxm whether his birth has boen *&gt;***•' ' iK. .-v^wa^KWrt im • so registered Y «ithin one or two years of its occurrence.

If we h ve rightly - ryrt^K. 1 construed t ie King 's Regulation then it is true that foreigners are able to register their birtha and marriages at the Political Agency; if we have not construed it rightly then there appears to b© no authority under which the Political .gent tas been registering their births and deaths.

The Bahrein Government may from time to time notify the Governments whose nationals in Bahrein will be subject to the prohibition laid down in Article 1 and such prohibition will have effect from the date on which the notification in question has been published by the Political Agency in Bahrein. 3. A foreigner who is a national of a Government which has been notified under Article 2 and who already at the date cf publication of the notice owns immovable property covered by the provisions of Art.l, may continue to own it for one year from that date. At any time after the expiry of one year the Bahrein Government may compulsorily acquire the property or may put it up for sale, but the price to be received, in either event, by the owner shall not be less than the sum determined by the valuation prescribed in Article 4.2. 4.

There may be objection, you point out, in the Bahrain Government issuing the Notification in question hut it is the only way in which they can legally enforce the law against the subjects of any particular State. jr Paragraph 4 of your Express letter. As it will be the property of foreigners , i.e. individuals who come under the Juris diction of the Agency, which has to be sold, it is the District Court alone, and not the Bahrain Government, which has jurisdiction in the matter. This being so it seems to me that all the District Court / S .6. ^ 15 I5 —(M-2089)—2-4-35—200,000.( / ly -2- Court has to do in case the two assessors do not agree is to appoint a third assessor. The odium, if any, for fixing the price of the property, which is the important point, will be on the assessors. If nobody buys at the assessed rate, the owner will remain in possession but liable at any time to be forced to sell at the price assessed, see Clause 3 of draft law. 4. X propose therefore informing His Majesty's Government that their draft Nationality and Property Laws are suitable and will do this when I receive from you drafts of the letters referred to in paragraph 5 of India Office letter under reference. These letters I will forward to the India Office with my commenls, if any. 5. When His Majesty's Government have approved of these letters the Nationality and Property Laws will be ready for issue by the Bahrain Government, but before the latter actually do this they must decide to what foreign nationals in Bahrain they intend applying the Property Law (see Clause 2 thereof), since I think it would be undesirable for there to be any delay between the publication of the Law and of the Notification applying it. Will you please therefore consult Mr. Belgrave personally and confidentially on this point and submit a draft Notification which I will send to His Majesty f s Government for their approval. The main point to decide is, of course, whether any other country besides Iran should be notified. Prima faci e I snould think, in the first instance at any rate, it had better apply to Iran only for the reasons given in the last lines of paragraph 3 of your Express letter. ^nce the law is made applicable to Iran and has been working for some time it will be easier later /-3- later to apply it, if necessary, to other countries. 6, A final point arises which, as far as I know, has not yet been considered, i.e. how the sanction for the application of the Property Law is to be legally effected. Since the individuals concerned are foreigners this sanction must come from us, presumably from a new King's Regulation which will have to be issued under Article 70 (b) of the Bahrain Order in Council.

In the case of sub -clause .2 (c) of the Nationality Law I prefer the alterna tive text commencing 'if tney shall have been registered....' . [t) With regard to the prohibition under Article 1 of the of Ownership of Immovable Property. The Bahrain Govern- m ent will doubtless want to make the prohibition immediately a Pplicable to nationals of Iran and I enclose a copy of a draft Notification by the Bahrain Government which has been drawn U P by the Political Agent, Bahrain, in confidential consulta tion with the Adviser, Bahrain. It is proposed that this (Signat Sh0Uld S -H. (Designation)siould be published by the Political Agent on the day that it is issued by the Bahrain Government. 4, A point arises, which, so far as I know, has not yet been considered, i.e. how sanction for the application of the Property Law is to be legally obtained. Since the individuals affected are foreigners this sanction must derive from us, presumably in the form of a King's Regulation under Article 70 (b) of the Bahrain Order in Council applying the local Property Law. If this presumption is correct I suggest that a draft King's Regulation may be prepared by the Foreign Office. 5, I note from the enclosure to India Office Printed Letter No. P. 2.2827/36 dated tne 2eth April 19S6, that it nas been agreed that the fee for registration for the purposes of Articles 1 and 2 of the Nationality Law should be fixed at Rupees S5 and that the Foreign Office are preparing a draft Amending Order in Council. ^ / % 6. With reference to paragraph 5 of tne India Oifice letter referred^to in my paragraph 1 above. I enclose cop,, of a draft letter which it is proposed to address the Shaikh after personal negotiations. Loch considers, anc I agree, that it would be preferable to leave him tc write a simple letter of acceptance couched in his own worcs. 7. Owing tothe necessity of keeping the proposal s^cr- 1 : until the laws are actually brought into icrce in order prevent prior mass registration, and the impossibility preventing leakage should the proposal be ccmi . ^n^catea t.c Shaikh (and through him to his family) at the prese t sta^e, the /tj A e draft laws have not been put before His Excellency. The Adviser, Bahrain Government, has, however, been consulted fully by the Political Agent on his draft laws and my foregoing recommendations relating thereto. I suggest that advantage should be taken of the Shaikh 1 s presence in England during his fortacoming visit to put the matter before His Excellency. As his Adviser will be with him. His Excellency should have no difficulty in replying and I think we can assume that he will raise no difficulties. The text of the two laws and the Bahrain Government Notification would then be sent by the Shaikh to his representative in Bahrain for immediate promulgation. At the same time His Majesty 1 s Government would telegraph me repeating Political Agent, Bahrain, that this was being done, and the Political Agent would arrange for the simultaneous publication of the King's hegulation and Amending Order in Council referred to in my paragraphs 4 and 5 above. 8. It may be convenient to sum up the steps still to be taken before the two laws can be brought into force. A. As I have no comments to ofi'er on the two drafts (except that I prefer the alternative text suggested for Clause 2 (c) of the Nationality Law) His Majesty's Government will presumably now finally approve of the two drafts. B. His Majesty 1 s Government to approve or otherwise of (1) the Bahrain Government draft Notification referred to in my paragraph 3 above, and (2) the draft letter to the Snaikh referred to in my paragraph 6 above. C. His Majesty's Government to draft the Amending Order in Council referred to in my paragraph 5 above. ^ ''VwV - v. a t ^ D. /-4- D.

On the Shaiith's acceptance being communicated by him to his representative in Bahrain, and by His Majesty 1 s Government to myself and the Political Agent, Bahrain, the Shaikh's representative will publish the two laws and the Notification, and the Political Agent will simultaneously publish the King's Regulation and the Amending Order in Council. sd.

Five Bahreinis resident locally who are in this category and who are expecting to be conscripted have asked us to intervene with the authorities.

Of which yo u were sent &gt; »opy with our eemi-official letter Mo, 60/2/3? of January 12th last. i end sie copies of a questionnaire and answers given Dy four holders of Bahraini passports at Basra, which have been sent to us by Brickell. The whole question as to their liability to be called up for military service seems to depend on whether or not Bahrainis were, in August, 1924, recognised in Iraq as possessing Bahraini, as distinct frora Ottoman, nationality. If the answer is in the affirmative, there seems to be no ground upon which the Iraqi Government could claim these men as Iraqi nationals, and indeed Article 9 of the Iraq T'atlonality Law (quoted in Bateman's letter to Briclcell) could be cited to prove conclusively that they are not Iraqi nationals. If, however, the Iraqi authorities contend that before Augist 6th, 1924, there was no such thing as Bahraini nationality, they could claim the men as Iraqis under Article 3 of the Law. f f\y ♦ r * * Foreign Office despatch No. 665 (B 7283/1527/91) of the i3th December, 1954, takes the view that it Is easy to establish that Bahrain has been Independent for 130 years and that Bahraini nationality has existed for all that time. If we/ 'WALIAY, S3Q.li&gt;S we are really confident of being able to establish this, the Iraqi claim would fell to the ground. There ie, however, the danger that ciscueeion of the status of Bahrain may result in which y?is Majesty's Government are anxious not to discuss. Whether we intervent on behalf of these men is therefore a question of expediency, and we should be grateful for your views on this. The matter is somewhat urgent, as one of them, Saiyid Jafer, has already been warned for military service and deprived of his passport. Yours ever, (Initialled).

My dear Fowle, Would ypti kindly refer to India Office Express Letter of the 17th April, P.Z*2333/37, and connected correspondence about the Bahrein Nationality and Property Laws. I now enclose - - ^ Mis- a copy of a demi official letter from the Foreign Office in which they suggest that some enquiries might be made as to the position of Bahreinis in the Hejaz or Iraq in regard to the ownership of real property, in case it should in due course prove necessary to consider whether the Government of Saudi Arabia and/or Iraq should be 'notified' under the new Bahrein property Law. If you agree, it may be as well that these enquiries should be made. i/ itP.Z.5070/37. (E 1885/30/91) FOKSIGN OFFICE, S.W.I. 5th Jfay, 1937. \T&gt;' v / / V My dear Clauson, In paragraph 3 of our official letter E 1885/30/91 ot the 8th April about the new Bahrain laws respecting nationality and the ownership of real property by foreigners we asked that a certain interval, say at least two months, should be allowed to elapse between the publication of the law about property and the intended notification bringing it into force against Persian subjects, and added that a further communication might follow regarding certain aspects of the question as affecting Persian subjects. The present letter is intended to be regarded as the further communication in question. 2. When the suggestion was first put forward in 1935 that the Bahrain Government might retaliate for the treatment of Bahrainis in Persia by placing before a substantial number of the Persian colony in Bahrain the unpleasant alternatives of (a) becoming Bahraini nationals or (b) remaining Persian nationals at the price of registering at the Political Agency and losing the right to own real property, we raised no objection because, leaving aside the expediency of retaliation, there appeared to be nothing in the legislation by which it was proposed that these objects should be attained that it was not perfectly permissible for any State to incorporate in its system of law if it wished to do so. We therefore contented ourselves in the main with purely legal and technical suggestions, only opposing the proposal that there should be discrimination as between British subjects and other foreigners in the matter of the fees to be paid to the Political Agency for registration and urging that safeguards with regard to the forced disposal of real •J-Clauson, E sq property/to ..q. m property not less adequate than those contained in the Persian law of June 7th, 1931, regarding the ownership of agricultural property 'by foreigners should 'be incorporated in the property law. Our views on these aspects of the ^ p ^ question were set out in Ward's letter E 493l/762 // 91 of the 30th August, 1935, to you, end the enclosures to that letter. 3. It is, however, necessary, now that the legislation is on the point of coming into force, to take account of the probable reactions of the Persian Government. 'e cannot expect them not to be annoyed, for they are clever enough and suspicious enough to guess that the measures are mainly directed against Persian nationals, ever; if the reasonable period for which we have asked is all ewer, for the sake of appearances, to intervene between the promulgation of the legislation and the 'notifioataon' cf Persian nationals. But owing to the care which has ceer, taken over the drafting of the laws, there is, fortunately, no provision to which they can point as constituting discrimination against Persia or any other country, or as amounting to a breach of any contractual obligation, or even as being, in the abstract, of an unreasonable or oppressive nature. Indeed precedents for many of the provisions are to be found in their own legislation. Provided therefore that no discrimination takes place in fact, we ought not to have any insuperable difficulty m finding an answer to any Persian complaints. 4. This question of discrimination in fact is, however, one with which we feel we ought to deal at this point, especially as we do not seem hitherto to have placed our views on the political aspect of the question on record in writing. The property law is permissive as regards notification, i.e. it leaves it to the discretion of the Bahrain Government whether to 'notify' a foreign Government or■ %) F m 3. or not. We expressed no objection to this at the time since it is always desirable to make provision for the exceptional case. But in general we could not, of course, agree to discrimination taking place against Persia in practice. In other words, if any other Government were crought to our notice or that of the Bahrain Government (especially by the Persian Government) as fulfilling conditions similar to those obtaining in Persia, we should probably be obliged to ask that the government in question should be 'notified'. 5. Whether or not a foreign government fulfils the conditions of the Bahrain law is a question of fact, to be decided in each case on the facts. The Bahrain Government cannot be expected to be acquainted v/ith the laws of all the countries in the world in regard to the ownership of property by foreigners. Moreover many States have different rules according to the ( personal characteristics of the foreigner concerned (e.g. whether he is a Moslem or not) and others have different laws in different parts of their territory (e.g. in the United States of America). In any case many States restricting the ownership of property by foreigners may have no nationals in Bahrain, and others again may have no Bahrainis in their territory. 6. For practical purposes the Bahrain Government would probably meet the required standard of noi -discriminatiDn if they were to 'notify' the Government of any country which had been cited and confirmed as fulfilling conditions similar to those obtaining in Persia in the matter o^ the ownership of real property by foreigners and in which either (a) resident Bahrainis were in practice restricted by the local municipal law in respect cf the acquisition and ownership of real property or, alternatively which had (b) nationals resident in Bahrain who, in the absence of 'notification', would enjoy greater advantages than Persian nati onals/4 1 90) n tj.oi.dls. either condition might prove a sufficient be,sis or 'notification' from the point of view of meeting Persian complaints of discrimination. 7. In actual fact, ss there are presumably no restrictions on the ownership of real property by Bahrainis in British India or the other Arab States of the Persian 1- , tie only countries which really come into the picture are Saudi Arabia and Iraq. 8. A copy of 'Regulations in respect of Landed Property in the Hejaz' issued by the Saudi Arabian Government in October 1934 was sent to the India Office luniou^ .-K ni jrta|n point under cover of Foreign Office letter E 6982/6849/25 of the 3rd December, 1934. On the 18th January, 1934, the Saudi Arabian Government issued an official communicLUd which was intended to be an interpretation of cer 4 in the aforementioned regulations and a copy of this communique was sent to the India Office under cover of Foreign Office letter E 1013/403/25 of the 13th February 1935.. In addition Foreign Office letter E 146],/403/25 of ^ /m? the 8th April, 1935, forwarded a copy of fa despatch of the 12th February, 1935, frcm Pyan, summarising the position generally. 9. The effect of these regulations seems to be that no foreigner, not even a Moslem foreigner, may acquire or own real property in the Hejaz (except that a Moslem foreigner may acquire it for the purpose of converting it into a 'Waqf') but that these restrictions do not apply in other parts of Saudi Arabia. 10. So far as we can ascertain without further reference to the Embassy in Bagdad, the acquisition and possession of immovable property by foreigners iij. Iraq is governed by (a) 'The Immovable Property (Consent to Alienation) Proclamation,' No.58 of 1919; and (b) the 'Law for the Registration of Immovable Property in the *V&gt; &gt; ' ' nam e of Juristic Persons,' No.34 of 1929. Copies of theIll ® s - foregoing enactinents are enclosed for ready reference, together with a copy of a despatch No. CO/1344 of the 30th Septa-nber, 1927, from the High Commissioner for Ira.q to the Colonial Office, which treats of the Question generally. 11. The position revealed by these documents is somewhat obscure, but seems to be that persons other than 'Arabs of the occupied territories' (presumably now 'Iraqi subjects') may not, whether juridical persons or individuals, acquire real property without the permission of the Ministry of Finance, which is not however as a rule withheld when the property is required for some legitimate purpose and is situated within the limits of a town or village. 12. We suggest that it might be prudent for the Bahrain authorities to make enquiries as to the position of the Bahrainis in the Hejaz (if any) or Iraq in regard to the ownership of real property. We will at the same time ask His Majesty^ Representatives at Jedda and Bagdad whether they (or the Consul at Basra) have any information on the subj ect. Yours ever, (Sgd.) Lacy Baggallay.P.Z.1081/35 IH BRITISH LEGATION, JEDDA. Copy No.26 S34/136/8) (E 968/403/25) Sir, 29th January, 1935, / With reference to my despatch No.3 of 6th January, relative to the recent Saudi legislation on real property in the Hejaz, I have the honour to forward herewith a ^translation of a communique of 18th January, which the Saudi Government circulated officially to the foreign missions here on the same date and which was published in the Umm-al- Ciura' on 24th January. It purports to interpret the regulations promulgated last October and is obviously intended to have a reassuring effect. I believe it to ue the work of Fuad Bey Hamza, who was away when the regulations were issued and on his return realised that they were too drastic. Fuad Bey told me himself on List January that the communique was one of the fruits of his labours at Riyadh and claimed that it removed every objection to the regulations. I hope to discuss the matter more fully with him when he next comes to Jedda, but in the meantime I think the position is that he has had to compromise with the authors of the regulations. The result is not very satisfactory for the reasons stated in the following paragraphs. 2. sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) of the communique deal with the acquisition of property by foreigners. The former reaffirms the principle that, so far as the Hejaz and the Hejaz only is concerned, foreigners are precluded from acquiring property. The following sub-paragraph foreshadows some measure of relief for foreigners, who are Moslems, but be Right Honourable kcVO .. etc. Sir John Simon, GCbl.,2. but it contemplates only measures to enable such foreigners to possess Government owned property e .g., under long leases. Both sub-paragraphs represent the attitude of the Government as being in conformity with Shari'a law but, so far as I am av/are, that law as such does not preclude any Moslem from acquiring property in the Hejaz in full ownership. In any case, the communique does not meet the difficulty of foreigners, who, being Moslems, were allowed in the past to acquire property, despite the provisions of the Ottoman lav; of lo67. 3. Sub-paragraph 3 of the communique deals with properties owned by persons who, at the time of acquisition, were Ottoman or Hashimite subjects and were therefore entitled to own property, not only under the Shari'a but under the former civil law. It holds out to the owners a hope of favourable consideration of applications under Article 11 of the recent regulations and this is prooa^ly intended as a definite promise. It is not, however, worded. Moreover, it does not set abide the ru ^ article 8, which appears to limit the right of the foreign owner to the full enjoyment of his property pending sale to a Saudi subject or conversion into Wakf or the rulB in Article 11 itself that a special tax of 15^ of the income from the property must ^e paid during any period of grace allowed. 4 I hope to be able to report further on the subject v .-hen ! have been able to discuss it more fully with Puad Bey Hamsa.

It will remembered that in the early summer of 1933, Ibn .aud removed the restrictions previously imposed on the enjoyment of their properties in this country by members of the Hashimite family, with one exception. For several years before that decision was taken, His Majesty's Government were consistently unwilling to intervene officially in the matter but, having regard to the instructions given to me at the time, I am assuming that there can be no objection to n«r sounding Fuad Bey personally and cautiously on the question whether the regulations of last October and the enclosed communique apply to Hashimite properties. I em inclined to think that Ibn Saud will find means to treat their case as one apart. 7. I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosure to His Excellency the Viceroy of India {Foreign and Political Department), His Excellency the Governor of the Straits Settlements, Singapore, and to His Majesty's High Commissioner for Transjordan, Jerusalem.

It has been observed that the object of the provisions 01 the Regulations concerning the possession of landed property in the Hejaz issued on 29th Jumad-ath-Thani 1353 (8th October, 1934) has been misinterpreted. The Govermne; therefore find it necessary to explain its object and scope and to define its mode of application. 1. The fundamental reason which caused the Government to prohibit foreigners possessing landed properties in the Hejaz was the establishment of a position which has continued to be respected from the beginning of Islam and the observance of the rules of the holy Shari'a, so as to put the Islamic holy country in a position of security against its passing into the hands of foreigners. Consequently the districts that come under the provisions of the said Regulations are the terri|ories of the Hejaz within its boundaries as recognized by the holy Shari'a; hut, in the territories of His Majesty the King, other than the Hejaz, the freedom of possessing landed properties hy foreigners is not governed hy the provisions oi the Regulations concerning the possession of landed property in the Hejaz. 2. In addition to the facilities allowed to foreigners under the provisions of the Regulations concerning the possession of landed property, as regards their ability to dedicate the landed prop^ty for perpetual charitable purpose, the Government of His Majesty the King contemplate giving consideration to a proposal for a regulation enabling t^ foreign to '» ^ ioo.t.4 1. » ' !

The Government declare that they accord to such persons the right to apply for extension of their enjoyment of their landed properties provided they apply for the same. 13th Shawwal 1353 (Sealed) Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 18th January, 19o5,I NO DIS'jjRIBU'nON .

A t P t .yan to Sir John S imon ~ (Received March 4. ) (No.40.) Jedda, February 12', 1935. sir, ^ % 0 WITH reference to ray despatch No.26 of the 29th January, I have the honour to state that on the 6th February I discussed at some length with Fuad Bey Hamza the effect of the Saudi regulations on real property promulgated last October, and of the interpretative communique of the 18th January, As this discussion was of a general nature, exploratory on my part and explanatory on the part of Fuad Bey, I do not think it necessary to record it in detail. The principal thing that emerged from it was that Fuad Bey, who had nothing to do with the promulgation of the regulations, is greatly embarrassed and has been trying to make the best of a bad job. His conversations with the foreign representatives, several of whom have shown interest in the subject, may encourage him to make a further enort to undo the mischief wrought by Sheikh Yusuf Yasin and others in his absence. 2, Another fact of some importance which emerged from my oonTersation with Tuad Bey is that the Saudi Government have raada the mess, into which they have got themselves by oiieir ill- considered legislation, still messier i'y trying i-o import into, it conceptions and one or two terms derived from the former Ottoman legislation on one particular iind cf properly, viz.. Government or 'Miri' land. This was, as you ore aware, the ^ subject of elaborate Turkish legislation^see Young-s Corps deDroit o ttoman. Vol.VI, p.45 ff.), which defined the quasi- proprietorial rights of private occupants of land, the fundamental ownership of which was vested in the State, It dealt, inter alia, with the nature of the titles, which occupants could acquire. I do not know whether that legislation was ever applied in the Hejaz, but there is certainly no machinery now in existence in this country which could give effect to its principles, even if the position as regards the legal character of all titles were not, as Fuad Bey confessed to me, hopelessly confused. 3, I have embodied a short general account of my conversation with Fuad Bey in paragraph 7 of the enclosed memorandum, which I have thought it advisable to circulate to the posts indicated in it, in view of the repercussions of this question in various directions. 4. As the enclosed memorandum brings the whole situation up to date, and as the special question of Eashimite properties is now the subject of separate telegraphic correspondence, I am not sending copies of this covering despatch to any other British authority. I have, &amp;c. a M)EEV&lt; ETAlu Enclosure in No.l 4 'Pircm nn ^tp1 cm Ov.nerS. hy Sir A ndrew iQ on inicj. ^ ^ TTopert y in the Hena^. THE Saudi regulationson real property, which w mentioned in paragraph 841 of the Jedda report for October and have been referred to in later reports, have proved to be of wider interest than was anticipated. I au thereiore of the above posts, although some of them are already fully or partly aware of the facts.ThQ regaiations in (iuestion were published in 'two instalments in the Uimn-al-Q.ura of the 19th and 26th October last. They reasserted the principle that no foreigner may acquire real property in the Hejaz, subject to a relaxation already admitted by Regulations promulgated in 1931 and reincorporated with slight alterations of form only in the regulations now in question. This relaxation was that a foreign Moslem could acquire property for the sole purpose of converting it simultaneously into a Wakf, but only a Y^akf, for the perpetual benefit of Moslems in the Hejaz. 2. What was really new in the regulations was the provision regarding persons who had acquired their property as Ottoman subjects but who had become aliens vis-fc-vis Saudi Arabia. Such persons were required to sell their property to &amp; Saudi subject or to convert it into Wakf, as above, within one year and were deprived, ty an obscurely worded article, of the right of disposal in the meantime. It was provided that the period might he prolonged on application to the Government, subject to the payment of a tax of 15 per cent, per annum of the income from the property during any extended period allowed. Foreigners inheriting property were similarly required to sell it to a Saudi or convert into Wakf. 4. The basic principle that foreigners may not acquire r..l property In th.

Nevertheless two classes to acquire real property in the .leja.. of question arise, as follows;--4- q0 (a) In practice many British subjects and protected persons mere in the past allowed to acquire property ^ua Moslems, Can they now be deprived of rights which they acquired by tolerance under previous regimes? (b) Many persons who were Ottoman subjects and had therefore a clear legal right to acquire property are now subjects of States other than Saudi Arabia which have emerged from the ruin of the Ottoman Empire, Can they now ue compelled to part with their property? And, if not protected in any other way, are they protected by article 33 of the Treaty of Lausanne? 5. Arising out of earlier correspondence regarding the regulations, I drew the further attention of His Majesty's Government to the questions at (a) and (b) above in a despatch No.3 of the 6th January, Shortly after I had done so, the Saudi Government issued a communique dated the 18th January, which was by way of remedying the grievances created by the regulations of last October, which it purported not to amend but to interpret. The main points in this communique were as follows: - to other parts of Saudi Arabia. (b) The Government were considering possible legislation to enable foreigners to hold Government ('Miri') property 'by way of long lease and other proper Sharia means,' (a) The regulations rested on a basis of Islamic principle applicable only to th^Hejaz, not (c) The Government did not wish to take retroactive measures against persons, nov- aliens, who, as Ottoman subjects, had acquired property under■ 5 ' I c l I ,793/ the Turkish regime or persons who had acquired it under the Hashimite regime. It had therefore given them the right of applying lor an extension of the period of one year, 6, This communique has not placated the interested foreign missions, least of all perhaps the Iraqi Legation, which^art from its general interest, is specially interested in the case of the properties owned by members of the Hashimite family. Gertsln restrictions on the exercise of their rights by members of that family were removed in 1922 and it is now suggested that the regulations of last October mq^ undo the effect of that removal of restrictions, 7, I discussed the whole subject unofficially with Fuad Bey Hamza on the 6th February. He admitted that the article in the regulations which deprives owners of the right of disposal of their properties pending sale or conversion into Wakf was badly worded and said that it did not mean that they could not let their property. He said that the provision of the communique mentioned at (c) in paragraph 5 above was intended to be promissory, i .e., that if applications were made for an extension of time they would be granted, and granted for an indefinite period. He admitted that the special 15 per cent, tax remained in force. He was vague on various minor points I raised, including the unfortunate political effect of the action of the Government in so far as it might affect the interests oi the Hashimites, Incidentally he admitted that the state of tenures in the Hejaz was hopelessly confused and that, though the law refers to Government or 'Miri' property, which was the subject of important Turkish legislation, it would be very hard to say what the tenure of any property was, 8, Fuad Bey made no secret of the fact that he disapproved of the regulations, which were promulgated in his absence. HetoXd me that he had had them by him for a long time, b W t had always been unwilling to see them promulgated both for economic and political reasons. He has had to face so much criticism by the foreign representatives, although I do not think that any mission has taken the matter up officially as yet, that he may make a further effort to remedy the^schief. In any case, u. am inclined t,o think that Ibn Saud would find some means of meeting the special grievance of the Hashimites, but at present those of ohe Tamily who are not Saudi subjects are in the same position as other ex-Ottoman owners of property, ANDREW HIAN February 11, 1935.r FOREIGN OFFICE, 461/403/25. s.w.i. 8th April, 1935.

The explanatory coi.jaunlque issued oy the Sauai GoTsrncient (a translation of vhich waa enclosed in your despatch ^o. 26 of the 29th Janu ary), and the record of yuur Bey conrersation with i 'uad/Eaidxa (as reported in paragraphs 7 and 8 of the memorandu.. enclosed in your despatch xio. 40 of the 12th February), suggest that there iu no f leas danger of a rigorous and inBqu.iti.--Oie application of the., re ulJition^. should, howerer, the Saudi authoritiea proceed against Briti ih subjects or protected persons who hare been suffered in -he past to acquire ownership of land in the flejaz despite their foreign nationality (class (1) in paragraph Co* y ur abore- mentioned oieino rand urn), I fear that it will 201 ae pos-.iOi.e to do more than to urge in their favour the general tolerance which, in default of direct evidence or of written permisaioa, must presumably hare existed to aaice the acquisition possible, and in the last resort to press for a re as nab. e opportunlt/ them to sell their land under equitable condi ioas. JH regulations theaeelTes do not expressly refer to the case of4 persons who have been suffered in +h 0 j-iLrea m the past to acquire ownership of land in the Hejaz, but as pointed out in paragraph 3 of mjr despatch No. 446 of the 11th Deoember, 1934, it would presumably be open to the Saudi Government to maintain that such ownership was contrary to the law as reaffirmed in article 4 of the regulations. At the same time their contention would surely be weakened by the fact that 'preTious Governments' in the form of the Ottoman and Hashimite regimes did in laci tolerate the acquisition of land by Indian and other osiem 'foreigners'. I am unfortunately not in possession of any information which would answer the enquiry at (b) in paragraph 3 of your despatch No. 3 as to the attitude adopted under the Kashimite regime towards the ownership of land by foreign iwoslems, but it appears at least to have been tolerated since cases have survived into the present regime. 3. As regards the case of British subjects or protected ^ ( persons in class (II; in paragraph 6 of your memorandum, viz., those owning land in the Hejaz, who at the time of acquisition were Ottoman subjects, but who have subsequently become aliens vis-a-vis the Saudi State ( e.g . Palestinians and Cypriots), it would not be possible to invoke the Treaty of Lausanne since the Hejaz did not become a party to it and the Saudi Government are clearly under no obligation to observe its provisions. The most that could be done on behalf of this class of person would be to insist on their obtaining a fair and reasonable opportunity to dispose of their land, such as the regulations themselves appear to allow. It now seems possible, however, l U * t t from paragraph 3 of the translation of the Saudi communique enclosed in your despatch No, 26 that these persons will be allowed to retain their properties indefinitely, subject to the tax imposed by article 11 of the regulations. 4, I assume from telegram No. 7 of the 16th February from the High Commissioner for Transjordan to the oecretary of- t.1 -3- iitate for the Colonies (repeated to you ae telegram No. 4) that the posit.j.on O-i. the Hashimite properties has now been satisfactorily settled, and that there is no longer any danger ol the regulations being applied in their case. 1 am, etc., (Sd. ) JOHN SI j LON.Telegram q. irom Political Resident, Buahire.

In practice it will'probably be found that the Persians who own property will elect to become Bahrain subjects in order to retain their property, so that the cases that will come up for assessment are likely to be few. The objection to transferring the work of assess ment from the District Coutt to a Bahrain Court is presumably that foreigners are subject to the jurisdic tion of the Agency. Finally, it is not compulsory on the Bahrain Goverr ment to acquire the property or put it up for sale under Article 5. If no buyer is forthcoming the Persian ownei- * would be left with a sort of Sword of Damocles hanging over his head. — Ref. para 5 of puc (4-^).
