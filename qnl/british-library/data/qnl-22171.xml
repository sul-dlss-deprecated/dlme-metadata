The articles to which I refer are meat on tho hoof and wood fuel. In order to forestall a possible shortage of these articles in the years to come in Bahrain the Bahrain Government might consider extending gra zing grounds on the island, and planting tamarisk groves. This latter developenent has proved a great success in the Sh&amp;iba and Zubair deserts of Iraq, and I see no reason why similar success should not be achieved here. 3. We were discussing the employment of an agricultural assistant and I suggested the employment of a trained Central European from Palestine as I had seen really excellent work done by them in Khuzistan. Have you thought any more about it ? 2. Speaking broadly there are two essential articles v C.Dalrymple Belgrave, iSsq., C.B.E., Adviser to the Government of Bahrain Bahrain.GOVERNMENT OF BAHRAIN. D.o.No./rr?-^^ Adviserat©, June EE, 1946, Reference your D # o*No. C/593 dated 5th June 1945, I have gone into the question of firewood and have considered the possible affect upon our supplies which would be caused if wood was not forthcoming from Persia. Though most of the wood which we use is imported to Bahrain by Persian craft yet only about 10 % of it is grown in Persia, the remainder comes from the Batna coast. If Persia tightened the control on native craft and reduced ( the trade between her coast and Bahrain we would suffer severely from lack of meat, certain cereals, dry vegetables such as onions and potatoes and many other necessary commodities but the reduction in imported wood would not affect Bahrain very seriously. S. I agree that it would be of lasting value to Bahrain if grazing grounds could be developed which would support herds of cattle, sheep and goats. At present, in years when the rainfall is normal, there is grazing in Bahrain for up to five or six thousand head of cattle and sheep for two or three months during spring. If fresh water were found on Hawar Island the grazing would be considerably augmented. In my opinion the main obstacle in developing grazing grounds is the lack of water. The average rainfall is about S inches which is I imagine very much lower than the rainfall E/- Coni.' Ji&amp;L B A HR Am RECEIPT.at Shaiba or Zubair therefore any cultivation of this type either grazing or trees would in Bahrain have to depend upon artificial irrigation. Artificial irri gation means the sinking of more artesian wells and for the last five or six years it has been the policy of the Bahrain Government to restrict the drilling of new artesian wells except where water is very urgently required. At present we have a file of applications for permission to drill wells in the towns and in the country, all of which have been refused. Almost every week His Highness Shaikh Sulman refuses requests for permission to sink new wells. The whole question of the water supply has been the subject of correspondence in the past between the Bahrain Government, the Agency and the Bahrain Petroleum Company. 3. Some years ago I formed the plan of putting AMi plain under cultivation by drilling wells to irrigate this large stretch of good land, but the two experimental wells which were sunk were both failures and tie scheme was abandoned. Later I learned that this area was outside the water bearing region. There are however large areas of good soil where water could probably be found, on the south west coast of Bahrain where an important agricultural experiment could be under taken, but before considering such an undertaking it would be necessary to obtain expert advise as to the chances of getting water and also to consider whether it will not endanger the future of Bahrain’s artesian water supply if the Government should decide to sink a number of new artesian wells. If this were done itis likely that the restriction against drilling wells by the public would have to be removed. The expert in these matters is Godfrey, of Bapco and I suggest that you and he and I should have a discussion. 4. Regarding an Agriculturist, for what we are doing now, in a small way, I think the man we have is suf ficient but if we did decide to launch out on a large scale then I think an Eastern European would be valuable although His Highness would prefer to employ a Moslem.

The Chief Local Representative, \ The Bahrain Petroleura Company Limited, Bahrain. Dear Sir, The Bahrain Government is interested in the possibility of developing some of the open land in Bahrain for agricultural purposes and for this $Mjkl80 we should like to obtain from you an opinion on the possibilities of obtaining a supply of water sufficient to irrigate a large area which might extend to as much as 100 acres. The question is tied up with the general water situation in Bahrain. In the past, as you are aware, there was no restriction on the drilling of artesian wells by private individuals. Later it appeared that many natural springs and also artesian wells were decreasing their production of water. In some areas large gardens were ruined owing to the drying up of natural water supplies. The Bahrain Government then forbade the drilling of any more wells except in a few particular cases and for the last eight years the drilling of artesian wells / has practically ceased. 2. The Bahrain Government would like to obtain a comprehensive report on the underground water supply in Bahrain with the following information 2 /—2 a. Description of formation where the under ground water occurs, both in the case of shallow surface wells and artesian supplies. b. Map of Bahrain marked to show where artesian and surface water is likely to be found. c. Any data that is available showing the effect of pumping on flowing wells on the underground supply. Is pumping iikely to reduce the general water level? Can it be explained why certain wells have gone dry, such as those in the Burri and Aali area ? d. Within whet areas of Bahrain could a greatly increased volume of artesian water be obtained without fear of exhausting the supply and at approximately what depth would such a source exist. Would it be likely to be available on the Aali plain or on the coast near Zellaq or Jesra or in the neighbourhood of Saar ? e. Is it likely that if an artesian supply, as mentioned above, was developed and used for irrigating a large area of land in which surface wells are abundant that the supply from the surface wells would be improved as a result of increased irrigation ? 3. If, from the information which the Company now possesses, you could give me information on these points I should be greatly obliged. Yours faithfully, Adviser to the Government. coF4-174.

Yours very truly For R K* Brown ? Chief Zo^al Beproscntativj, TSbe Bahrein Petrolffem Compesy’ Idiiut a. WtM Urtftin oc—His Britannic Majesty 5 s fteli« The principal source of Bahrein 1 s underground water supply appears to be from rainfall in the Dehnna of Central Arabia, though rainfall in the Hadhraiaaut and as far north as the Syrian Desert nay contribute to it. The supply is therefore being replenished yearly and though Xirdted in aaount is inea&amp;mstibia* Since the rainfall enters the underground strata where they outcrop in Central Arabia i*t a high elevation, this water flows from those underground strata In Bahrein when they are tapped by wells. The artesian belt as it is to-day on Bahrein Island is shown, shaded in green, on the attached saps. An increased rate of withdrawal of water by the drilling of many new wells will reduce the strength of the artesian flow in the areas where the wells are drilled and generally will re duce the size of the area in which wells will flow* Ten or twelve years ago the artesian belt was greater in area than it is to-d^. At about that time many new wells were drilled in some areas allowed to flew with little or no restriction. The result was that some wells ceased to flow in these areas and the strength of flow of the other wells was reduced. The effect is the same whether the water flows, or is pumped from the underground strata. The situation here is similar in mry respects to the artificial development of water supply by impounding streams with dams at higher elevation than the point of use of the water. For example, a stream is dammed near its source and an artificial lake or reservoir created. The yearly supply of water is not changed but the supply that there is can be piped from the dam to deliver s water flowing through these pipes over a wide area. So long as the rate of use is no greater than the supply the reseriuir will stay full and everyone will receive their quota of water. If raaiy new outlets are made in tbs dam the level in the reservoir will drop and everyone relying on the reservoir for their water will suffer. There is ample water at Bahrein to fill the requirements of all inhabitants if Its development and use is properly regulated. Excessive drilling of wells, improper completion of wells, and waste ful use of the water by individual land owners is a detriment to other land owners and Bahrein community as a whole. There are areas on Bahrein Island where the underground water bearing strata outcrop 0 The height of these outcrop areas are of course at or above the height of the water in them, otherwise the water would flow from them* Now if water were taken from these water bearing strata, down dip from the outcrop, and pumped to areas higner than the outcrop, then irrigation ditches could be so arranged that the excess water after irrigating would return to the under ground reservoir. In this way the water from the wells would serve a useful purpose and the only waste would be fro® evaporation.Bahrein Island where water is being from veils which are not ccntrtslXed ation of water a? ungth of water flow from the wells , l even enlarge the area** in which -iter Hesonreee of BaT 4» 4 «• 4) jRoao IMoJcoassa SO to 50 ft.

The crest of the deem is located imodlately cast of Jebal Dukhan in the centre of the Island. Btelnsfee expresses the opinion that the structural growth of the Bahrein dome started in the early Cretaceous, or possibly* earlier, and that the Island has remained a land area since the early Miocene or a period between 3boane and Miocene. The lend area was evidently subjected to oansidorabla erosion between the Rocene and Miocene resulting in Mlooene beds making fairly deep inroads Into the Boemi on the margins of the land maos. These Miocene beds are in turn covered by the more recent flat laying deposits on the margins of the present Island. Subsequent erosions! forces have further exposed formations deep in the Kooone and in the central basin inside the Rim Rook the beds below the Shark Toeth Shale series are exposed. These beds constitute the ChalSor !and m the oorglna of the exposed area oonoist of Hzoastono^ ToerXa and shales. The marls and shales provide structural traps for the accumulation of rain watar trm small catchment areas within the Hia hook and are the source of supply of water to the hand* dug wells which exist near the Kim Rock in the exposed area.

This 'terrace' has evidently been caused by slumping in the Chalky Zone by the removal of anhydrite and/or gypsum, either by solution* or what is more likely* the action of sulphate reducing bacteria# On the crest of the structure* and for some distance dawn dip* there is no anhydrite remain* lng in the Chalky Zone but as one goes further down dip, particularly on the northern plunge* considerable aggregate thickness of anhydrite is developed.

Political Resident, I v^it©a the Persian Qulf from 2rd to 7th March, 1949 for the purpose of advising on the possibilities of agricultural development. I jraveraed the cultivated area, of Bahrain island and some of Sitra island, visited many date plantations and other areas under cultivation, observed agricultural conditions and practices, and studied such reports a ' VJ ' literature bearing oh the subject as were available. Sir Rupert Hay personally accompanied me on one tour of the north of the island; Mr, Balrysapie Belgr&amp;va, Adviser to the Bahrain Government, and his son took me tp the cultivated areas on the east and to Sitra: ilhan oaldb liohamed Khalil showed me those in the north and west of the island. Sir Rupert also arranged for H.R. the Sheikh of Bahrain to receive me and he accorapanied me on that occasion. I met various oirtcers of the Bahrain Government and was specially interested to find that. Mr. S. Hills, Head of the Public Works Department, la basically a graduate in agriculture of Cambridge University, It was pleasing to meet iJmn Sahib Mohammed Khalil, whose jiome country in India X know well, x mn grateful to him for the general infomation he gave me on Bahrain conditions and for .interpreting for me the conversations which we had with (mltivators during our tour of the west, I wish to express my deep appreciation of all that was done by Sir Rupert Kay and Mr. Belgrave to enable me to seo conditions at first hand and to meet people likely to be of interest and help to me in fulfilling the purpose of my visit. PERSIAN GULP RESIDENCY AC35A 2. The territory covered by the Political Resident includes not Kuwait, Qatar, the Trecial Coast and Muscat. I did not tnese latter areas on this occasion. Regarding them an handbook on the rersian Gulf gives the following information ; - _ . i3 a waterless desert offering no scope for agricultural development. The annual rainfall of 5 to 6 inches a year is inadequate to support crop cultivation and at best can give a limited amount of grazing In ^avourable years to the flocks of visiting nomads from the Xiiai.nl-and, The local water is brackish and even drinking water has to be brought in by country craft. 2&amp;tar. This peninsula is rainless, hilly and barren, ^ Truoial Coaat, Of the seven Sheikhdoms in this area the territory of the largest is said to be mostly desert. In the submontane part of one of the smaller, however, there are fairly extensive date gardens and natural vegetation. This territory could not be visited in guc time available. Sea transport is slew whilst air transport to Sharjah is available only once a week and even then, in order to study conditions, one must be prepared to spend a week until the arrival of the next plane/ Much of the country consists ©f bare hills but for a miles along the Batinah Coast north of Muscat, there is a xertile area in which date gardens are abundant. There are said to be fertile oases in the Cte&amp;r, hills also. To visit this area from Bahrain a period of two to three weeks would be required. Further south, Dhafar province produces coconuts, millets and sugarcane. Its possibilities for agricultural development have been exaaiined already, in November, 1947» by the Director of Agriculture, Aden. '' &lt; BAHRAIN 3* The territory known as Bahrain consists of a group of small islands, Bahrain island itself is by far the largest of them: it is almost 30 miles long by about 10 miles broad at its widest point.

It should not be assumed that on this basis an artesian well could irrigate 12 acres day by day if operated non-stop. Apart from the adverse effect which a continuous flew of a large numbor- of such wells might have in depleting the underground water supplies* a 3-inch irrigation which is adequate for .a normal soil would be unlikely to suffice for salty soil^ of the Bahrain type.

The date plantations are usually owned by the sheikhs who aometimes work them by direct labour and' at other times.lease them to tenants. The lease is. generally for two years. Cash rente are said to be paid for crops and for fruit bearing trees, other than dates. The Gate paisas rent siay be'in kind or partly in kind* am partly in cash. The view was ejepreased that a tenant receives from v* t© •&lt;|* of the produce at a rough guess. On Sitra 1 aland the actual rents paid for two date plantations were given as 1* . Hs. 800 in cash plus 1.000 date sticks. (A date stick is the midrib of a date palm leaf* Owing to the scarcity or absence on the island of other wooci* it is of oonsiderable importance and value for building and other purposes). H'o ©ther charges were payable. According to &lt;iata given on the spot this plantation produced last year 192 m&amp;z (36 lbs. each) of dates. They Were sold at Ra. ? to 8 per maund. The total value of the fruit was thus about Hs* 1*500. At that rate the landlord got mors than half the value of the fruitband the date sticks in addition. 2» Hsi 1*200 cash* 2,000- date sticks and 3&gt;6 lbs* dried prawns* - The proportion of the. production which these payments ro'prpsented could hot bo ascertained, as ho information was forthcoming as to the value of the produce- of this plantation It is ©r interest to note that the rent included an.item not a product of the plantation.

Irrigation pos aiblliti 05 tl&lt; f 8 air ®f d J' stated, water, and not land, is the limiting factor in increasing agricultural production, and the prospecta of agiioulturiil development^depend basically on the extent to which more water can be mde available for irrigation j^a-poses. Possibilities appear to exist (a) better use of existing irrigation supplies. be possible 11 oonnsctlon th ^ e are in which improvements may \l) A reduction in the volume of irrigation applied at present to existing cultivation. It is common in Middle Sast- countries for cultivators, when soils are saline,^ to apply to their crops considerably more water than is ordinarily required for the production of crops on nonsal soils. This is eceaetimes considered a necessary measure of self- protection for, unless the gsut concentration in the soil is kept below the son© of the plant roots a poor crop will result. Such a practice, however, need not be continuous and never- ending. If conditions arc such as to permit the provision of an efficient drainage system, the heavy irrigation will gradually leach out the salts which will o&lt;y carried off to the sea in these drains. Automatically the volume of water necessary to produce an average crop on the soli will be reduced and the water thus saved can be applied to the cropping of additional areas, The tota saving in tMs. connection may m relatively small, in vie of the small area of cultivation. (li; It was stated frequently that a very appreciable volume ox existing water supplies is wasted through being allow© fco flow to the sea unused and uncontrolled in drainage ditches. Ia such water is suitable for irrigation purposes and is not drainage water with a salt content harmful to plant life and to the soil, steps should be taken to ensure,f o (h) Its proper, utilisation.

Whilst the growing of field or garden crops saay not be possible in all plantations* oases wore seen where the land was neither fuliv* ocxyjpiGd by date paisas nor utilised in any other vmy. Thus the water which supplied to the palms was inefficdently used* In Iraq it is a comatm practice so grow citrus fruit trees underneath the protecting shade of date.palms. It is suggested that in Bahrain more use could be made of the land within many of the date palm plantations and that water which has to be applied to them could sometimes serve a dual purpose in irrigating a fruit* vegetable* fodder or other crop tMlst fttqmlydng the needs of the palms simultaneously, f 41 :&lt; ‘ : ' lort * a3e ln present irrigation supplier. sources and , thiS oonn9otion to be sough* from underground fZf: p ** ls Knom &gt; it «» only taka artesian form, as other sup Axei] are ox fhar unsuitable or inadequate. , l6 ‘ _ .

Practically all the cultivation is done by hand labour. Cows are said to be very Jealously guarded from view in the closed yards of dwelling nouses because of th© 'evil eye* superstition. «5°* In considering the possibilities of an increase in the number of cattle, it has to be born© in mind that there is no natural grazing, that the animals mmh bo entirely stall-fed, that no dry fodder of the nature of wheat or oat straw, dried millet or maize stalks is produced locally, that the only local fodder is the excellent lucerne which is fed green and that dry concentrates must constitute the remainder of the feed. Concentrates of the types usually fed in other countries are not available, unless imported, and at present sun-dried sardines take their place. 31* 3-® clear, therefore, that the scope for Increasing the number oi livestock is limited by the food possibilities. An improvement in the cropping system, whereby fodders and vegetables are grown in rotation, may increase the supply of green felder and to that extent my permit 3xi increase in the number of cattle, as well ns an increase in the area of lana under cultivation, in so far as irrigation resources permit, Generally speaking, however, it would seem that the greatest contra button to animal husbandry may lie in an improvement of. the asilking tiualities of the cows. It appears to be popularly oonaidsred that the indigenous cow© give very fair milk yields but, even so, there can be ho doubt, jdiafc present milking qualities can be improved by the practice of selective breeding. That it can be improved to an even greater extent am within one generation only, by importing male animals of certain well- western cattle breads for crossing with local cows, is undoubted but ^ ne insroduction of mixed blood is not without certain drawbacks, and it c&gt;.e£»irabi.^ ti.* concentrate on the slower policy of improvement by selection within the indigenous-animals themselves. Such work should be a feature of the activities of the agricultural department of the State, x or this purpose it would bo necessary to found a small dairy herd. If properly organised and managed the sale of milk and other products of ■ ne dair ^ r should make the scheme almost, if not entirely, sulf-supporting. 32. Man-power for cultivation is said to be limited, but if bullock labour were used for some of the cultivation operations which are now performed entirely by hand labour, the capacity of the existing man-power could oe increased so as to enable larger areas to bo cultivated. 0 TH*&lt; STATE AGRICULTDRAI, GA«W -w*c ■*»*—J- tr~ , -.rMHf: •S f ~r Mt-» 33* tiC-j&amp;Q years ago the State established an agricultural garden at Badaiya on th© west coast of th^aland. From time to time its area appears to have been extended ~ the latest extension has been made only recently- — till it is now about 33 acres. 34» ^ i.he OiiicQr in charge of this garden is Mr. Ahmad Lutfi, an Eg^tian gentleman who was appointed in 1946 on a two years’ contract. On its completion Ms employment was further extended for four years. His salary and allowances are stated to b© Rs* 490 (about £36.15 B Qd) per mensem, plus a free house. Mr. Lutfi did a four ye«irs ? agricultural course at the Higher School of Agriculture at Shibin el«Kom in Egypt. On its completion h©'worked as a teaching assistant on fruit and vegetables at Giza under the Egyptian Ministry of Agriculture, He then went to ijaudi Arabia for three years, of which he spent two at El Khari and one ff 3a ‘ Subsequently he entered the service of th© Bahrain Government in his present capacity. He is 29 years' of ar?©.It is understood that »b,e duties of Mr» Lutfi are ocnfinod to the mnageiaent of the departmental g^irden, and that he does not go outside advT1 - se oultivators unless they ask for his help. Mr, Lutfi lives la e garden. There are no farm buildings. Recently purchased cquipaer t ^noludea spraying and dusting machines for the control of insect pests aoa fungal diseases but so far the necessary insecticides and fungioic ss have not arrived. .. o of the garden is of the light, sandy type, particularly ■ ■-i vho case ox r,he area v/hich has been added recently. The garden receives its irrigation water supply from two artesian wells: the newer weix lives the better water supply. The water table is about 3 feet from ground -surface, 37- The site of the garden lies lower* than the surrounding land tvna, consequently, when, rail falls the garden receives the drainage water froa the latter. 33. Cultivation is done entirely by hand labour. No bullocks are kept but occasionally, where necessary, ploughing is done by a P.W.D. tractor. About 25 working non are employed. Their pay was stated to be Hs * P er mensem each and that of the head gardcner Rs. 93 per mensem, 39* fh© expenditure on the garden last year was said to be about ds* 34»0GD and the incomc of the order of Ra. 24,000 « 25,000. W- ' rhe ^rden, which has been laid out neatly in plots, is devoted to i»he groy/ing of fruit, vegetables and fodder. 41. The vegetable crops are extremely poor as a rule, particularly carrots, cauliflower,^ beetroot asid brinjal. Onions and tomatoes which are bed ng grown for sale are better. Some plots arc being prepared fo - '* melons. Lucerne constitutes the only fodder crop. The growth is goci on the old-established plots but poor on the new area. The produce is supplied, to the horses of a police post ^ust outside the garden. 43; One small lino of sugarcane is being grown. Its origin couli not be discovered. Growth la fair, m 44* A variety of fruits is being triad. Date palms, papaya, mango, poioegranate, guava and grapes represent the older established varieties. ^5* The main varieties of Bahrein dates are said to be Mirzaban. ond dhanaizi, There wex*e no means of fudging at this season of the ye ir hovr the quality of the fruit cafsp&amp;res with that of the best Iraq varieties 46. Different varieties of grapes are being grown along some of the garden roads, as well as in plots. They are trained on wires. Th 3 . fruit is said to do well and to sell in Manasgaa at P.s» 3 per seer. 100 grape vine plants are available for sale; 200 have already been sold. 47. There* are ten well-established guava trees. It is stated tb it s4?is fruit grows successfully and that each fruit commands a price of Annas 2 in the local market. The Manager said that he has 300 nursery plants for sale. 43. Last year the Manager obtained from Iraq nursery plants of olives and of different varieties of citrus fruits « oranges, grapefruit, lemons. He stated that about 800 of these citrus plants had been sold directly to the public. 150 more had been planted for trial in the garden. li successful they will b© used in due course for the proviai n of budwooci with which to graft citrus root-stock for sale.49* $0 ol Vrn trees were also planted last year.

The future 5X This garden is the only depart&amp;entally-run area on the island. Its primary, functions should be exploratory B.n&amp; experimental. If cultivation in Bahrain is to be improved and if the beat use is to be saade of the very ligated area for which irrigation supplies are sufficient, much knowledge is still to be acquired and it can be obtained Qi&amp;y by trial and experiment. fhe first function of tills garden, therefore, should be to try ou&lt;» as iauny x .vui and. vegetables as possible and to dot ermine whidfi saosc successfully. Before this work is undertaken seriously it a,/ ’os necessary to acquire the services of someone more expert in that line than the present staff. In the growing of so-called English veg etables those responsible for the crops now on the ground have much to f.^am xx tae standard of these crops is a fair index of the state of their own knowledge* 55* Whilst the garden appears to have contributed little, if anything 00 far, to the improvalient of the agriculture of the island, a distinct step in the right direction was taken last year when a number of varieties of fruit trees were planted. In planting new fruit trees it is of the utmost importance that the best varieties of fruit should bo obtained. The iu&gt;.,!i and yield oi the produce wilr ultimately become knewn only after the lapse of sense years when the tree reaches maturity. If either should prove to b© bad these years will have been largely wasted. - uon re search and cocperimcnt have provided the necessary ini creation orv nhich to warrant the next stop, the second function of the garden should be the production of reliable, healthy, and cheap fruit nurfcesy P laiAto , tor sal ® local cultivators. A good citrus plant should coa- more nearly Annas f* rather than Rupees 5. which are charged now for plants uaported frem outside. Since the trees in the garden should provide the oudwood with which to produce nursery plants for the cultivator, it is to ' hoped that the-varieties obtained from Iraq last year are of high -3* The supply of good vegetable seeds from the garden say be a Matter of seconnary consideration so long as good seed not requiring acoll'-ixtixxiticn* in available at reasonable cost fro^ outside countries, as is said to be the case at present. x: ; i ® Rowing in the garden of lucerne or any other leguminous crop for sale as green fodder should be of secondary and very minor importance, unless in so far as it can occupy a profitable pX&amp;o© in a suitable crop .rc nation whioh should be adopted, 4 7 ° ^ p any further expansion of th© area of the present garden is contemplated it right bo desirable to consider whether it would not bo preferable to seek another site elsewhere. The impression was obtained ^ astfjdy soil of th© garden may bo representative generally ox the soil down the west co&amp;at of the Island it may be less typical ©f thav on the east coast. If, on closer examination such should prove to be che case, any increase in departmental activities of this kind would be °“ ; - i0re P ra ®txcai value if conducted under those different conditions. 29th March, 1949« H.R.
