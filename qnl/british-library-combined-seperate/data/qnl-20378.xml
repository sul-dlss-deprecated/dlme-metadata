Malet writes that it is the opinion of the Honourable Governor in Council that the Bahrain chief [Muhammad bin Khalifa] is responsible for the sale of captives in his territory, but that if Humud bin Mujuddel [Humeed bin Majdull] has quitted Sheikh Muhammad's service, there is a question over whether blood money can be rightly demanded of him. The Governor in Council recommends 'inflicting a severe penalty' upon Humeed bin Majdull.There is an enclosure with the Malet's correspondence: a copy of letter no. 38 (folio 36) from the Commodore and Commander in Chief of the Indian Navy, to Lord Elphinstone, the Honourable Governor and Resident in Council, dated 19 January 1854. The Commodore writes with reference to the act of piracy committed by Humeed bin Majdull of Gunnah, stating that although he does not have the resources to increase the navy's presence in the Persian Gulf, it would be possible to send a vessel to investigate this act of piracy.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051555.0x00000b#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
