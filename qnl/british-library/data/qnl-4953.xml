(B) If the Company is in default according to the provisions for arbitration set forth in the Sixteenth Article. Article Fifteenth. —The Shaikh shall not hold the Company liable if default should occur on the part of the Company in carrying out or fulfilling the provisions of the Agreement by the mere occurrence of force majeure delaying operation ; but should any difference occur between His Excellency the Shaikh and the Company as to the existence or non-existence of such force majeure, the same shall be referred to arbitration, as provided for in the Sixteenth Article. And the Shaikh stipulates that the force majeure delaying operation means that which occurs in connection with the Company's operations in Qatr and that nothing else must be taken into consideration and must not be used by the Company as an argument in this respect. And the Company shall proceed to effect repairs at the time when any damage, of any nature, takes place, and the period of the said delay, together with any period reasonably necessary for repairing the damage will be added to the period fixed in accordance with this Agreement. Article Sixteenth. —Should any dispute occur between the Shaikh and the Company in regard to the interpretation of this Agreement or of any matter arising therefrom or in regard to the engagements obligatory on either of the parties in accordance therewith, such dispute shall be referred to two arbitrators if no agreement can be arrived at for settling it by any other method, and the Shaikh will appoint one of them and the other will be appointed by the Company. Each of the two parties shall appoint his arbitrator within thirty days after receiving the demand therefor from the other party. The two arbitrators shall thereupon appoint a third arbitrator, but if the two arbitrators or any two arbitrators appointed instead of them are unable to agree upon the third arbitrator within sixty days from the demand for arbitration, the two parties agree that, in that case, the third arbitrator should be appointed by the Political Resident; and the Shaikh makes it a condition that he should agree to the third arbitrator.5 The award of arbitration shall be consistent with the legal principles familiar to civilised nations. The decision of the majority of arbitrators shall be final, and the place of arbitration shall be Qatr. On giving any award, the arbitrators shall fix a sufficient time within which the party against wbom the award is given, should carry out the said award. And that party shall be considered at fault only when he fails to comply with the award before the expiry of the aforesaid period and not otherwise. Article Seventeenth. —The labourers employed by the Company must be from amongst the Shaikh's own subjects or from amongst those approved by the Shaikh, excepting technical employees and the managers and clerks whom the Company may require and whom it cannot find in the country. As the Shaikh prescribes as a condition the dismissal of any employee whose retention is disapproved by the Shaikh, if the Shaikh has observed any irregular conduct on his part. And it naturally follows that the wages which the Company pays to the employees from amongst Qatr people shall be reasonable. Article Eighteenth. —The Shaikh and the Company declare that they base action upon this Agreement on the basis of good faith and pure belief and upon the interpretation of this Agreement in a manner consistent with reason. And the Company undertakes to acknowledge the Shaikh's authority and his rights in his capacity as the Ruler of the State of Qatr principality and to respect them in every manner. Article Nineteenth. —Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Shaikh in any manner whatever from granting concessions to other parties for anything excepting the Substances mentioned in the First Article provided that the said concessions do not interfere with the rights of the Company or its operations in accordance with this Agreement. Article Tiventieth. —The Company will pay all the sums due to the Shaikh, in accordance with this Agreement, into the Shaikh's account in the Eastern Bank Limited in Bahrein and the receipt taken from that Bank shall be a full acquittance of the Company's liability for the sum mentioned in the Bank's receipt. The Shaikh may, from time to time appoint another Bank or other Banks for the purposes of this Article, and this shall be done in writing. Article Twenty-First —This Agreement shall be binding upon both parties and their successors and assigns ; and it has been written in Arabic and English and all due care has been taken to make the two texts identical in meaning. And if any difference should arise as to the meaning or the interpretation of any article, at any time, the Arabic version is to be relied upon. Article Twenty-Second. —The expression year, month and day used in this Agreement shall mean what is consistent with the English Solar Calendar and not ^rny other. IN WITNESS whereof the two parties have hereunto set their hands and seals on the day and in the year mentioned in the preamble. (Signed) Abdullah Bin Qasim Al Thasi, Ruler of Qatar. Witness.
