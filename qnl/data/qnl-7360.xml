It was eventually decided that powers for the Aden Settlement could be granted under the Indian (Foreign Jurisdiction) Order in Council of 1902, through the Governor General in Council. It was also decided that the Aden Protectorate would best be served through the issuance of a Regulation under Section 71 of the Government of India Act.Subsequent correspondence for 1935 concerns the Defence of Aden Regulations (1935), and the potential for retrospective approval of emergency rules issued by the Chief Commissioner, in light of worsening relations with Italy.The principal correspondents in the file are as follows: the India Office Political Department (Sir John Laithwaite, Sir Horace Algernon Rumbold); the Legal Adviser to the Secretary of State for India (Sir Edward Chamier); the Air Ministry (Charles Evans); the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (Herbert Metcalfe); the Resident (later Chief Commissioner) at Aden; and the Under Secretary of State for the Colonial Office (Roland Vernon).The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the end of the correspondence (folio one).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Air Ministry</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Chief Commissioner, Aden</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Colonial Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Foreign Secretary</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Legal Adviser and Solicitor to the Secretary of State for India</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>War (concept)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Emergency Planning</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000517.0x0003af#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
