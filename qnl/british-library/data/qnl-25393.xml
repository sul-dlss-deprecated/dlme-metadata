Sir, Having received permission tso reside and trade in Mesop otamia (refce:- your P. 32 dated 19 th January, 1920), We now ask permission to investigate the commercial possibilities of the bitumen deposit'and wells in the Hit district. We ask, at this stage, nothing in the form of a concession, we propose to engage in an investigation entirely at our ovm cost by experts, and on the result of this investigation to base’ proposals to the local Government for the working of the products, probably on a royalty agreement. At this stage, all the action we ask on the part of the local Government, is that they should give their of r i sanction to such an investigation, and assist us using influence with the local landowners in having it peaceably carried out. We realise that any local landowners having valid claims to ownership of the bitumen fields will have to be made uil^mg parties in any ^scheme for their working. Finally we;may say that we do not propose to work kerosene oil or its bye-broducts, and consequently the existence of consessions if any for kerosene oil in thi ® a f e M”ld d te strictly hope he a har to our proposed operations which would he strictly limited to the extraction and refining 0 i bitumen. Presuming that this application will have to be hy you to the authorities in Mesopotamia, we v;ould ask that thMr decision may be communicated by cable as early as possible, in order that we may commence arrangements. ^ * ,r and on behaJ f °f ?e have the honour to he /*? 5 0TTI8H MESOPOTAMIA CORPORATION Ltd. * ** ^Jgpn) * i sir * ^ ^your obedient servants. ^ ' .Managing DirectorOTTISH MESOPOTAMIA CORPORATION LTD.

This Department understands that Major-General G. H. Grey does not propose to proceed to Mesopotamia on behalf of the British Trade Corporation, but on behalf of a private syndicate. It is understood in any case that General Grey and his party have deferred their departure for the moment, pending the question of the definite settlement of the future of Mesopotamia by the Peace Conference.

Please refer to paragraphs Nos. 75 to 77 of joint Trade Commissioners’ Report on Prospects of British Trade in Mesopotamia. Definite announcement of wishes and intentions of Ilis Majesty’s Government as regards grant of facilities to banks to commence or develop business in Mesopotamia would be of assistance, and is, I think, called for. We have at present, firstly, Eastern Bank, with branches at Basra, Amara, Baghdad and (by the end of the year) at Hillah. Arrangements whereby Eastern Bank has charge of funds of civil administration is terminable at six months’ notice. Secondly, Imperial Ottoman Bank, with branches at Basra and Baghdad; latter not yet working. Thirdly, Imperial Bank of Persia, with branches at Basra and Baghdad, and an agency at Amara, and branches at many places in Persian Gulf and Persia. Imperial Bank of Persia at present enjoy privilege of being the sole [? purveyor of coins] to His Majesty’s Government in Persia. Eastern Bank is, I understand, primarily an Indian commercial bank, and was only established in Baghdad a few years before the war. Management of Imperial Ottoman Bank is, I gather, predominantly French; has branches all over Middle East, except Persia, where it will probably open later. Imperial Bank of Persia is, as its name implies [? somewhat] local institution, with methods and traditions pecnliar to Persia. Management all British, and not closely connected with alliance (sic). It is understood following Banks are desirous of opening branches in Baghdad (1) Alliance Bank of Simla (after the war), (2) Tata’s Industrial Bank (immediately). So far as I can see it is in the interests of Irak that permission should be given to both these institutions to open here ; capital is scarce, and existing banks, perhaps not unreasonably, have hitherto adopted rigidly conservative policy. Latter bank, however, is financed, I understand, mainly with Indian capital which the Government of India may be unwilling to see invested abroad in existing circumstances. As regards former institution 1 suggest for the consideration of His Majesty’s Government that, if their entry into this field favourably viewed, Messrs. Boulton Bros, should be asked to send a representative to Mesopo tamia during the winter to investigate conditions with a view to opening branches in the near future. As regards Tata’s Industrial Bank, presuming that Government of India are, on their part, prepared to give permission, so far as concerns India, I should be glad to know whether His Majesty’s Government would approve, on grounds of general policy, their being allowed to open up in Mesopotamia. It may be mentioned that currency of this country, as far as can be ascertained, consists of about 7 crores of rupees, Government of India notes, and 3 crores silver rupees, with a certain amount of British and lurkish gold, almost all of which is in private hands.k l s ( 1J t ,^.-7 42521 From Political, Baghdad, 27th September 1918.

Please refer to Secretary of State’s telegram of 27th August 1917 intimating decision to postpone despatch of proposed Commission to Mesopotamia. With concurrence of General Officer Comma a ling in-Chief and ol Sir P. Cox, whom I consulted on his wa} T to Teheran, 1 venture to ask that possibility of despatching a small but authoritative Commission, say, three persons, to Mesopotamia during coming cold weather may oe considered afresh. The Commission which would doubtless include a representative of the Government of India, might perhaps include an officer nominated by General Officer Commanding-in-Chief in Mesopotamia, and should have power to co-opt heads of Departments and to call lor information on all subjects. It might usefully arrive in November or December and sit for three months. _ . , The decisions recently arrived at by Tlis Majesty s^ Government consequent on deputation to England of Sir P. Cox dealt principally with political and international aspects of our occupation of Mesopotamia and with general principles by which our actions on spot should be governed during period of occupation . . . T Though I have not been informed officially of these decisions, am being guided generally thereby so far as I am aware of them, and action has already been token and will continue to be taken so far as is possible on the spot to shape the administration in conformity with the principles appuned by His Majesty’s Government. . , . . , . . There is, however, a large class of political and administrative quest ions not covered bv the decisions of His Majesty’s Uovevnment. which will inevitably call for settlement immediately on peace. Many of these questions aie no. susceptible of settlement on the spot and cannot lie safely left ioi disposal by telegram when the time comes. nvA Some of them arise directly out of military demobilisation m • _ indirectly connected therewith, &lt;&gt;.(/., size and composition and location ot o-an-isom Facilities to British and Indian soldiers to remain aftei the uai.

Dear Mr. Wellesley:- I have teen discussing with some of our business friends here the desirability of giving immediate cons idera tion to the openings for British trade that the Persian Gulf and Mesopotamia will offer in the near future. We are informed that the Levantines are already at work to establish business agencies in those districts, especially in connection with the importation of cotton, woollen and hardware goods. No doubt they will profess that they are pioneers of British trade, but from past experience of these gentlemen we have reason to believe that the nationality of the article they deal with would be i immaterial to them. ^ at an early date to send out a small mission with the view of seeing whether it is possible to set up a few English merchant houses, or - where that is not feasible - to introduce a leaven of English blood into some of the existing firms. It is also desirable that we should see whether there are any public works, of perhaps minor importance, that should be taken in hand without undue delay.
