Bakhab was originally a home of the 3hihuh who ruled it until the time of shaikh Salim bin Sultan al ^asiml (circa 1830) f Shaikh of Has al KhaiBah f who seized it and appointed Shaikh Sulaiman y grandfather of the present ^shaikh Shaikh, as nis .^ali at hakhah* [^ing^Salaiman's time the Shaikh of Khasab attacked Bakhah y and when the ! all cf Bakhah appealed to the Shaikh of Has al Khaimah for help In repelling the invaders he refused to provide any and gave as his reason the fact that ne was prohibited by his treaty obligations with the Srltlsh from despatching an expedition by sea. ater Shaikh Suleiman succeeded in repelling the attacks from Khasab by his own efforts and his power gradually gained in strength. eventually, he hiaself attacked and plundered ias al Khaimah. After this the bnalkh of ftas al Khaimah abandoned all claims to Bakhah, which has since descended from father to son in the seme family. k. The present Shaikh is Muhammad bln Ahmad bin Sulaiman, Shlhhl. He Is about fifty years old. te at pears to be a straightforward man anvi to be respected by his people whom he does not oppress unduly. He is married into the Dubai family, and his wife is the sister-in-law of Shaikh Said bin **ktum of Dubai. He complains that his brother-in-law does not co-operate with him, and attributes this attitude to the Hi-advice of his son Has tld. He owns ten country- craft (four big and six small) which ply between India, East Africa and the Gulf ports. 3. The Shaikh claims that Bakhah consists of six Inhabited coastal villages, namely Bakhah, Al Jadl and Al Jari, (north of &gt;akhah), Teebat, Ghamdha and Fadhgha (South of Bakhah) together with some deserted villages on the coast and in the ....page £• and in the mountains. The northern limit he claims is Has al Jari and the southern Has &amp;1 Sha'aa and part of oha’ain village. In fact, he has no authority in She*am and the head•land is the natural boundary in that direction which is, incidentally, the end of the motor road from Bas al thaimah. 4. The inhabitants of fcakhah are Arabs (Shihuh), and Persians who live mostly by fishing and trading. There is one Hindu. The whole population is estimated at fc,000, and it receives its food supplies from bubal through the hharjah Agency in the same way as the Trucial Coast Sheikhdoms. The Shaikh charges neither customs duty nor anchorage fees on boats calling at hie port which is not an open anchorage. 6. The Sheikhdom is independent and pays tribute to nobody. The Shaikh mentioned that though he had been to Muscat to pay his respects to the Sultan, he owed him no allegiance ana preferred the protection of the Hrltlsh by whom he wished to be considered independent.
