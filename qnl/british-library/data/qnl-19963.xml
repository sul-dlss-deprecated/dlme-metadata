Sir, I hare the honour to state that I have recently returned !from a week* s tour to Bahrain* As in the case of my tour to Kuwait, my main object was to establish friendly personal relations with the Ruler. Go?onel Loch had just taken over from Captain Prior as Political Agent, Bahrain, and we discussed at some length the various problems with which the Bahrain State is faced. 2# The Deputy Ruler - His Excellency Shaikh Hamad (now the Ruler owing to the recent death of his father Shaikh Isa) is a kindly, simple soul, but unfortunately with no strength of character - unlike his fellow Rulers of Muscat and Kuwait. He is also laay and unbusinesslike. Mr. Belgrave, his Financial Adviser, informed me that when unpleasant subjects, such as State finances, have to be brought to his - the Shaikh's - notice, the latter has a trick of picking up binoculars and inspecting the shipping in-2- in the harbour, through the Palace windows, with other little w Bide-tracking' diversons of a similar nature. He is extravagant, with little or no idea of the value of money, and heavily in debt, though this does not prevent him from indulging in the expensive hobby of building netv res i denote ^3 for himself, or his sons. His extravagances for the time being are some what curtailed by the fact that - as Ur.Belgrave informed me - the credit balance of his private account now stands at the sum of Rso37-8-0. His passion is h«wking, which is the only activity that really Interests him. At the conclusion of the Durbar for instance, with which it is customary to welcome a new JPolitioal Resident, and at which I had made an oration of the usual official complexion, on my leaving the Palace, bhaikh HamaiJ. who presumably had been thoroughly bored with t.ti.e whole proceeding, instead of reflecting on the wise words I h;. d just uttered, insisted on displaying to me his favourite hawk, who - he was delighted to point out - actually answered to its name. 3. His iixcellenoy in short has my liking, but not my respect. A much worse man, endowed with some of the qualities of a ruler j would make a much better Shaj-^h. - t may be that now he is de .lure Ruler, instead of Deputy Ruler, he may rise to his responsibilitiest I have, however, little Lope ol this# It is of course possible that he may not live long to carry these responsibilities. He is nearer to 60 than to 55 and suffers from diabetes. Kor is he as careful of his diet as he should be. At an official dinner which he was kind enough I ' to ^ive me, ani which we ate Arab fashion withour finfers, and seated on the ground, he disposed of large quantities oi food* I do not blame him for this*, the cooking was excellent, and I daresay I ate almost as much as he did, but such indulgence for a man in his condition of health cannot be continued indefinitelyi SFM - i &lt;5 indefinitely with impunity. Shaikh Hamad's health raises the question of hia possible successor, on which I will address Government separately, as also on the other Bahrain questions, as they come up, which I discussed with Colonel Loch. I hare confined this despatch to an appreciation of Shaikh Hamad* s character, as this,of course, now more than ever since he is actual Ruler, is an all-important factor in Bahrain affairs. I am sending a copy of this despatch to Hia Majesty's Secretary of State for India» I have the honour to be.

Your Excellency For some years you have acted as Huler of Bahrain on behr.lf of your late Father,-lis Excellency Shaikh 3ir Isa bin Ali al IChalifah. He was ^uler of Bahrain for no less than 63 years,but now,alas,he is no more and Your Excellency Is now called upon to assume the full position -Jid responsibilities of the Ruler. It has always been the uark of a good Ruler that his first concern should be,not for his own welfare,but for that of his people,and in these days especially a modern Ruler has to take part in uany activities for the prosperity,safety and advancement of his State. For this reason I am glad to see that in Bahrain ''embers of the Al Khali Tail Family are taking part in the work of Government and especially in the administration of Justice and in the ^aladiyahs I would ecpocially mention Your Excellency's own work in this respect. You have acted as Ruler for more than ten years ana are,therefore,fully acquainted with the working of the Government and the needs of the State; and you have yourself administered Justice in the highest Court. Your experience in all branches of the Government will be of the greatest help to you now that you have yourself become Ruler of ^ahrain,and it is,T am sure, a privilege valued by your people to know that in matters of grave importance they can receive justice at their Ruler's own hands. There Lave been great changes in Bahrain since T first knew it. I see an efficient administration growing up,good Customs House (2)arran^einents, roads and motor cars,a Power 'louse and uany new uaildings. :.'ucli has bean done -o bring Bahrain into line with, modem requirements,Lac much remains ^o oe done and,unforuunateiy, money is no loiter available for improvements. Your Excellency is aware of ohe difficulties w -ith which Bahrain,in common with all other countries,has been faced ov /ing to one fall in prices and to the unemploymexit among' ohe people. Inaeed, one financial position of Bahrain is one of the most important problems,if not ohe most important problem,before Your Excellency,^nd it Is a matter which gives me cxlso grave anxiety. Steps have been iaken by Your Excellency oo meet ohis serious situation. All forms of public ex.&gt;e:idi^are nave been reduced,except for what was absolutely necessary to keep up existing institutions and to prevent a break down of the Administration. T fear that no further reduction in public expenditure is possible without ceasing oo provide such essential services as Police,Justice Education ana Public Health. Reductions in expenditure are always hard to make,but T think that the efforts of Your Excellency 1 s Government have won the approval of all who realise what has been accomplished. \s Your Excellency is aware '-lis Tajesty's Government have agreed to help the Government of Bahrain by foregoing their Treaty rights regarding the rates of Import duties,and the Government of Bahrain have accordingly enhanced the rates levied on certain imports But in spite of Your Excellency's efforts,and the reduction In expenditure,and the Increase in imporo duties and a reduction in the allowances granted to the Members of the Al Khalifah Family, which redaction they cheerfully accepted,a deficit occurred in the la^o Budget. I trust that it will oe unnecessary to call upon the Al Khalifah Family to face further reductions in their allowances but should it become necessary to make any further reductions,! am sure that they will accept them loyally for the good of the State. I would also say to them that it is not only in Bahrain that such reductions have been necessary. The Officers of the British Govern ment all over the world have agreed to a reduction in their pay and (3)oe liivued in igiisii )eecli. 4 allov /ances and in this they have been led by His L'ajesty the King, who,xiimse 1T y of his own Tree v /ilL,has surrendered a very large sum from his Civil List in order uO help his Empire and to show an example to all his people. The other Members of the Royal Family have 0 -iven up large sulis for the good of the Empire,and x.he people have also been called upon to make sacrifices,which they have done in the hope of restoring good conditions of trade and employment. Tot long ago T advised Your Excellency to make all the savings that were possible in the Civil List and especially thau, ♦ when any member of the \1 Khalifah Family (God preserve you) should pass away,it would be wise uo lei his allowance lapse to the State, wholly if possible,or in any case to reduce it ^.o such an amount as might be essential for the needs of his dependants# I am very glad to learn that Your Excellency has followed my advice in the case of the allowance of your late Father,His Excellency Shaikh Sir Isa bin Ali al Khalifah. By this means part of the very serious deficit in the Budget of the State has been met. T also congratulate Your Excelleacy and the Members of the Al Khalifah Family on their wisdom in continuing to observe the well known customs that all property of the Al Khalifah reverts to the possession of the 'Ruler,and that no Al Khalifah property shall ever be disposed of to persons outside the Al Khalifuh Family. It would be most .mfortunate if the ancestral property of the \1 Khalifah ;/ere to fall into other hands and so impair the position of the luler of Bahrain and the position of the M Khalifah as a Ruling family. T am afraid that T have had to paint a somewhat gloomy picture,but I hope and believe uhat better times are coming and that Your Excellency will,in uhe years to come,see Eahrain once more restored oo a position of jealuh and prosperity. It is possible, for instance,that the discovery of oil ma^ improve the financial position of the State. I hope most sincerely that this may be so, but it would not be prudent until it is quite certain that oil exists in commercial quantities to build hopes of this and,in any C4;■ # case,it mast take some time Tor an oil. field to be developed. There ars , more over, si^s, though uimy are out, small signs, of an improvement in trade,but a considerable period must elapse before the effects of an/ improvement will be appreciably felt in ^ahrain. In the meantime,^ as Your Excellency is of course aware,it is essential tnat no effort should be spared in balancing- the Budget and finding means for tlie development of the State. '•xaculy one handred and fifty ycai^s ago the A1 IChalifah Branch of the Utub conquered Bahrain,and it is o^er a century since the first Agreement was made between the British Government and the Ruler of Bahrain,and since that time the friendship between them has steadily increased. T am certain that .nder Your Excellency 1 s rule, the bonds between our countries will become yet stronger; and I would assure Your Excellency that fne British Government will al./ays be ready,as in the past,to advise you and to help you ./hen need arises. Both c/he Political Agent and T ar old friends of Your Excellency, and Your Excellency knows that you can count on us to do all Lhat lies in our power to help you in fulfilling the responsibilities which you are called upon to bear. I have the honour to bear to Your Excellency a message of goodwill and of hopes for Your Excellences happiness and prosperity as ^uler of Bahrain from TT is Excellency tile Viceroy and I pray that,God-willing,Eis Excellency^ good wishes may amply be fulfilled.

Sir, rtith reference to the correspondence ending with Government of India's telegram No.9t)-H of 2dth January 1933, I nave the honour to enclose a translation ol a letter ol thanics from His Kxcellency Shaikh Hamad to Kis iixcellency the Viceroy for the Kharita which His Excellency was kind enough to send him. 2. I presented the Kharita to Jhaikh hamad during my recent visit to Bahrain, at a iiarbar Held on the instant ^ at which the large number - for -lohrain - of 8ome / six hundred people were present, H.^.i3 . w Triad M , with Captain Crabbe, the Senior Haval Officer, on board, and the purvey Chip H.M.S. ^Ormonde', were both on a visit to Bahrain, while two Flying Boats accompanying Air Commodore Cunningham, Chief of the Stafi to tne ^ir Officer Commanding, * Iraq Command, had flown down from Baghdad on their way to luscat. Thus some twenty ^aval and r &lt;oyal Air Force officers were able to be present at the ijarbar. Arrangements for this function, which entailed considerable work, were made by Colonel Loch and Mr.Belgrave, Financial Adviser to the Bahrain Government.3. i sad expected, bb indicated in my letter «o. c Jo4-^ of 22nd December laat, that the presentation of the Kharita wo .la ce appreciated. Its reception, however, exceeded my anticipations. Shaikh Hamad was indeed most grateful tor it, ami I ieel s^re that the letter which 1 enclose is a sincere expression of his feelings, and not merely tne conventional ooBBunication cal eJ lot by occasion. The people off Baiirain too displayed mucn interest in tne Darbar, a crowd of some thousands collecting outside tne Efll where it was held, while the town was en fete for tnree days. There is little doubt tnat the public recognition of an Sxcellency as Ruler has consolidated His position, while he him self is personally popular with his subjects. it is to be regretted that - as X pointed out in my letter of 17tii December last, No.926-S - His xixcelj enoy lacks tiiose qualities whicn would make him respected and feared as a Jheikh in adciitioii &gt;.o being liked as a man. 4 # in the course of tne speech which I made before presenting the JUmrita, I took tne opportunity, besides ocnrtyin^ to the Shaikh assurances ot txie friendship oi the uovernwent ol India and of myself, of reviewing briefly the financial and general position of the State, of congratulating .lis .xcelxency on certain economies which he had recently effected, and - with, out being unduly pessimistic - of emphasising the fact txiat even further economies might be necessary in the future. It is an unfortunate fact that the number of indiriduals outside tne A1 Khalifa family who realise the seriousness ol the 1 inaneial position ol the State is small. 13oth Colonel . och and 1 tuere- fore considered that some remarks of this tenor would be bene ficial as likely to strengthen the hand of the Shaikh with regard to such economies as he had already effected^ or which it mijht be necessary for his Government to carry out in the future, ....future, and would carry the .aore weight as bein^ delivered on a public occasion* I Have tlie honour to be.

It is unfortunate tnat tne 3nailcn nas found nimself compelled to accept tne invitation from Ibn Saud, and thus to make a somewhat arduous overland Journey in his present state of health. 3. T/en If accompanied by a medical attendant the 3nBikh will run risks of not surviving the overland Journey, and this risk brings to a head a matter which I nave had on ny mind for some time i.e. what is going to nappen when the Shaikh does actually die, either in the course of the ntxt re# months, or &lt;? the next fe* years. 4. as you know, Arabs do not generally recognise primo geniture though they do insist that the successor to a Shaikh must come from the lhaikhly family, beyond this it is simply a case of the best man winning, by getting the strongest party in the State on his side. Sometimes he succeeds by bloodshed (the famous Mubarak, of Kuwait, killed two of his brothers in one night),and sometimes by a mere show of force as in the case of the present r&gt;naikh of Snarjah when ne deposed nis ; relative Thai id. 5. In lahrain Salman is the eldest son, but is ne likely to succeed, or #111 another member of the family probably Abdullan bin ' laa or tne Shalkn'a youngMt son, Abdulian put / Veightman, TUsquire. Political Agent, Bahrain.■ tn • 2 - 1 put hiraaelf on the tftrone ? And is tners likely to be any aort of open strife ? 6. The policy of tne Government of India, and of His ^j&amp;Jeaty'a Government, in tno Oulf is, for sound reasons, not to recognise fce/erehand any succesaor to a ohaikh, and though ve departed'from the practice in ^tar it was for tne special reason of inducing the .Ihalkh to give an oil concession in tne right direction. In Bahrain, however, we nave recognised nobody as successor, nor has tne Shaikh asked us to do so. 7. I like Abdullah bin Isa personally, and on various i occasions he has rendered us assistance e.g. in helping Belgrave to acquire the lana for the naval base, and in connection with the transit dues negotiations with the Saudi delegation. I seem to remember also Belgrave telling me tnat he - Abdullah - adopted a sensible attitude to the claims of the Baharna to better treatment. 9alman, on the other hand, is lively to be more amenable to our influence, but would not be such a strong ruler, and I have a personal predilection for a Shaikh who can stand on his own lege. The young Abdu?lan I do not know much about. In your reply to m./ letter please iacluJs a ahort career and character sketch of these tnree individuals, with ages etc. /hich of Va^se tnree do you tnink has the most popular support in ^nrain ? I presume there is no other likely candidate ? 8. learing the above considerations in mind, *hen the Shaikh does die what part, if any, do you think we ought to play in getting any particular individual made Shaikh ? It ria.y well be that we should play no part at all. 'The best work of a Political Officer is very often what he has left undone. • .Ve certainly do not want to pursue the injudicious policy /policy tfe Have adopted in otner parta of Asia oi setting up a puppet Huler, whom we nave tnen to support on tne tnrone against popular feeling. 9.

No....fa. Date... confidential records The 6th January 1938. Please refer to your demi-official letter No. 908-S dated the 30th December 1937 on the subject of the Bahrain Succession. 2. Everyone, Including Shaikh Abdullah and Shaikh Salman, did his best to dissuade His Highness from accepting Bin Saud's invitation to return overland, but the old man was hopelessly stubborn and would not move an inch. 3. As you say, there is a fairly considerable possibili ty that the succession will open in the near future, and an immediate report on the questions that you have raised seems necessary, though there will not be time to prepare dossiers of Abdullah Mr 'Tsa, Salman bin TT amad and the younger Abdul lah before I leave for Qatar. These will follow by the next mail. 4. T have had a long talk with Belgrave and even he, with so long and intimate an acquaintance with everyone in Bahrain, is reluctant to forecast v/hat may happen if His Highness dies on the way back from the Haj. We both agree with you that the likely candidates are the three whom you name, though the young Abdullah is perhaps scarcely a serious candidate yet. In a few years he certainly will be, and if he develops as he promises, he will be a most desirable claimant too; but at present there is insufficient serious support for him in the A1 Khalifah Family. ► 6. Another outside chance is Shaikh Mohammad bin f Isa, but he need not be considered very seriously. His mother was/- Hon'ble Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Trenchard Fowle, K.C.I.E., C.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire,-2- v/as not of the blood, and he does little to increase his popularity by absenting himself from Bahrain almost all the time. The main point to note about him is that he may try to organise support in the Family for Salman against Abdullah, since the former's succession would obviously be less harmful to his personal prestige, 6. rn :.Uo : t there are two candidates, Abdullah bin 'Isa and Salman. In the ordinary course of events His Highness should, when he feels his time is coning, nominate one of them as his successor; andjsuch a nomination should settle the matter since otherv/ise the scales are fairly even betv/een the two. And here comes the first check to hopeful prophecy. Sometimes Salman is in his father's good books and sometimes very much the reverse, and nomination by the old Shaikh on his death bed might easily be influen ced by some petty cause for annoyance given him by Salman. At present it seems Salman stands well with his father, and His Highness has, from his own share of the oil royal ties though at Belgrave's suggestion, recently increased his allowance. Consequently if His Highness begins to fail on the present Haj it is quite possible that he will nomi nate Salman. It is nevertheless totally unpredictable what he might do, and since it upsets him even to think of his own death no one has for years dared to put the subject to him. 7. Apart from possible nomination, the betting is very even, with perhaps a shade of odds on Abdullah bin 'Tsa. The essential fact is that Abdullah appears to command ra ther more support in the Family than Salman. Outside the Family, it seems possible that the Bahama would be with him against Salman who retains the old-fashioned idea thpt they/-if I *■ ■ I 17q % -3- *■* f m they are no more than the servants or the slaves of the Ruling Family, and is rather inclined to be too free with his opinion. As you remark, Abdullah has in recent years adopted a far more sensible attitude towards them. The majority of the Arab merchants will probably lean towards Salman, but they do not carry the weight they used to for the simple reason that they have not the money. But, as T have said, the essential factor is the Family, and though T accept 'Belgrave's opinion that Abdullah should receive the backing of the majority, we cannot ignore the under currents, the strength of which it is so difficult to esti mate from one month to another. T find it equally diffi cult to estimate v/hat effect the new wealth from oil may have, but I have a sneaking feeling (not shared by ^elgrave) that this may serve, as a factor in Salman's favour. Every one knows that Salman is a bit of a coward and fairly easi ly stampeded; he may therefore appeal to some members of the Family as more easy than Abdullah to loot of a fat sha 'e of the oil royalties. Even so, if T am asked for a definite opinion, I should follow Belgrave and say that Abdullah has probably greater following in the Faj7ii?-y; he certainly has a better brain and knows how to use it, and T should expect him to succeed. 8. Neither Belgrave nor T feel that there is any very great danger of disturbance on the supposition that the succession becomes open in the near future -- certainly if Abdullah's star appears to be in the ascendant. T con fess I should not be quite so comfortable if Salman looked like succeeding; for I should not expect Abdullah to let A that 12 lakhs slide out of his grasp v/ithout an effort though T believe he is wise and strong enough to prevent anything/-anything In the nature of rioting, ''hether there might be a nasty accident in the Family is a different matter, though it is noteworthy thatjthe Family has always been sin gularly free of 'accidents^. 9. Accepting the premise that Abdullah bin 'Isa and Sal man are the only candidates to be considered, T do not consi der that there is any need whatever for us to attempt to wei ght the scales on either side. At the worst either of th em would be a passable ruler, and either of them might develop really well. Abdullah obviously would not be so amenable and might want to strike out a line of his own, but he seems to have acquired plenty of ballast lately; he is undoubtedly capable and even in the present regime he is the ultimate arbiter on many questions. Belgrave likes him well and T believe the liking is mutual, so T should not apprehend any sudden or violent changes either in policy or in the adminis-» trative system. Allowing that he will not be easily led, he should nevertheless be quite a desirable Shaikh. Salman would, as you say, be more amenable to influence, in fact very much a duplicate of his father. He is a nice little man v/hom T like, but for whose personality T cannot find much respect. 10. Thus, quite apart from the point v/hich you make and which in my opinion must in any event be decisive - that we cannot think of setting up a puppet ruler against popular feeling, there need be no question of our backing either of the candidates. But even so, if the succession opens without a nomination made by the present Ruler, I think we may have a part to play -- in oiling the wheels. In considering the part we should play we must clearly visualise who have the right to share in the selection of the next Shaikh. Obviously no foreigner (including ourselves) should come into it. Bin Saud/-Saud might try to exert some influence and we must do the best we can to prevent this, - not an easy task if His High ness dies in his territory with many of the Family around him. The Bahama cannot, officially at any rate, 'be allowed any say whatsoever. The merchants too should not opjnly 'be consulted, and as I have suggested, their underground power is probably not what it used to be. Officially the decision must and should rest with the A1 Khalifah Family alone and I consider that we should be prepared openly to assert this position. Let us assume His Highness dies without making any nomination. The Political Agent should at once arrange for a Council of Hejency, if one is not already in existence, as there is at present under another name during His Highness* absence. He should then summon the v/hole A1 Khalifah Family and after a short sermon, in which he will make it clear that His Majesty's Government have no concern with the succes sion beyond requiring that the new Shaikh should honour the Treaties and Engagements of his predecessor, he should in vite them separately and secretly to inform him whom they wish to nominate as Shaikh. In brief he should arrange a secret ballot, which I believe would be welcome and would certainly be much to everyone's advantage. Having done so, he should then summon the Family again and announce the name of the winner. That, to my mind, is all that is required, public announcements etcetera being left entirely to the Bahrain Administration. 11. I do not recommend that this should be regarded as a hard and fast procedure to be followed in any circumstances. It may conceivably be quite unnecessary, but the Political Agent should be authorised to put some procedure of this sort into operation if he is satisfied after consultation with the Adviser that it will be to the public advantage to do so.

I have given Weightman 1 a opinion as to what line we should take, as ne is the man on the spot. 1 do not, nowever, agree with all his suggestions. (a) In the first place, according to general Arab custom It is not tne ^haiKnly Family wnich elects a new 3naiicn, but influential representatives of tne wnole tribe or cowiunity, and tnough in tne special circimBtances prevailing In 'fcnrain tne Tamily have considerably more power and influence tnafl in most Arab centres, nevertneless 1 do not tnxnic it is for ua^ to exclude others from s voice In tne election: if tne Faauly can exclude otners tnat is tneir affair, not ours. (b)/(to) If tne election of the new Kulcr is net Htceiy t o ce delayed Deyond a few daya, - Wbs eener«lly eloct h new SJiaikn pretty quicKly - tnen no Counoil of He^ency would appear to be neceesary. If tne election was delayed, tnen wnetner such a Gounoil anould be formed could Oe left to Oe decided at tne time* (c) I do not tnin'^ tnat the 1'olltical A^ent snould summon tne A1 JOialifan Family, as, wnatever ne aaid or aid not eay to tnem, it would certainly te generally fcelievel tnat ne nad tutored tnem. (d) If tfte family of tneir own accord an«ced for an Interview wltn tne jfolitical Agent, ne could not very well refuse to see tnem, out cnould content nmfself wltn informing tnem tnat nis Majesty's government did not wian to interfere in tne election of tne new Ruler, out tnat oeiore tney (.lis Majesty's Government) accorded recognition ne (tne new Huler) would be required to undertake tnat ne would n on our tne Treaties and ftiejagements of nic predecessor. («; I am afraid tHAt tne 'secret oallot' would nave an unfortunate effect as it would certainly be put about by tne losing candidate and nie party tnat tne political Agent, wno would be tne only one to Know now eaon vote was cast, nad rigged tne election. 7.

During-the last ten years of Shaikh Isa*s life his wife had very great influence over him. The old lady is still alive and is now doing the Pilgrimage. Shaikh Abdul'a was Shaikh Isa's favourite son. p - age la about 55. Ke has had a very slight educa- 4 -: - cr, a fact which he always regrets, but he has a remarkably good knowledge of foreign politics and western progress end Ideas. He Is very Intelligent, politically ambitious - I believe he has Ideas that when Tbn Saud dies Bahrain might possil ly manage to acquire some control of part of the maln- lan , - :.s cape. 1 ;?^ of making rapid decisions, and sticking to them In spite of opposition - the way he dealt with trouble In the schools some years ago Is an example of this - he Is gcoa at .isgti:s:ng his own feelings, has progressive Ideas e oi;1 administrative matters such as reforming the conditions under which estates of minors are looked after, the need for more medical work by the Government, Education, sanitation and agriculture. He Is more religiously tolerant than most of his relations, he disapproves of such things as liquor more from -he r of view of the harm that drinking causes than from vhe strict 'oslem view that intoxicants are Haram. T To -3 physically fit, until quite recently, and posslblv over ^ St- 11, he used to be thoroughly hauled /by Dr Dame every few s. 3 addiction to Vvomen is notorious, he has had more v.i\es and concubines than any member of the fhallfah famllv, which Is saying a good deal. He is reputed to be generous to Ms women while he has them and when he discards them. He always lives beyond his Income, most of the family do, but he never asks for money, '/hen he takes a loan he repays it - eventual, ly./-eventually. T Te Is not vindictive and treats his servants ana his own tenants we?.'!. TT e t akes a firm line with his sons - 1 vy of end - 4 : 1 em, some time a£;o he had one of them thrashed st-van.s In his Teglis for coming to the house drunk, were In vhe pe.^ 4 ; Shaikh ,'t'dul?.a amd his mother/feared and hated by the Bahama (the Shla aboriginals) towards whom they v ;ere very severe. Today he Is not liked by the Baharne, es pecially the older ones whoremeEber his past but their animo sity towards him has lessened and since I have krown him I have not heard of any cases of his ill treating them. 3ha. kh Abdulla has a strong following among the Khallfah especially ar,.on 0 the younger men and a certain set living In I'uharreq but he Is disliked by the older Shaikhs who mistrust him. He Is not popular among the Arab and foreign communities in I'anama but he is not actively disliked, it is generally eccepteC that his opinion Is valuable and his capability Is iccognisec 1 r. mun'clpal and educational matters. He is far ■-C* vtf ft_ ; c ^^e and bus^-nesslike than his brother r. T ohaiumad. The latter is very jealous of him partly t ecause Shaikh Abdulla has always had a larger salary from the Civil List although he is younger than I'ohammad, About twenty years ago Shaikh Abdulla was the most power- rr ir BJira-r , Shaikh Tsa gave him great authority, he uosit -^ith all cases and d isputes - there were no regular courts - and with y money matters and political affairs although Shaikh Hamad v/as the 'eir Apparent and had been officially recognised as such some time before. Possibly Shaikh Hamad took a second l^.ce from natural Inclination not entirelyhecause his brother i as given more mtnority than him by Shaikh Isa. T. shaikh fbdulla went to Kngland with his eldest son and some other Arabs from the Sulf. He also went to India and to Egypt between 1919 and 1923. In 1923 Shaikh Isa was deposed/-i ; 1 K j ■ lo'b deposed and Shaikh Hamad v /es made Deputy Iftaler. Shaikh Abdulla and his mother were the real leaders of a strong party which opposed Shaikh Tsa 1 s compulsory retirement though Shaikh Abdulla agreed outwardly to supi^ort his brother. . A number of leading Arabs w .re members of this party which was financed by She-'kh Abdulla and his mother, they included Shaikh Abdel Wahab Zayanl, Abdulla Zaid who now runs a print ing press, Jasim Chiravi v /ho retired to India and several others. Shaikh Abdulla was threatened with banishment if he did not behave. After this he made no open attempt to upset the autho rity of Shaikh Hamad and although in 1332 he was suspected by some of giving encourage:■ ent to the divers who created a riot T have never known any occasion when he has not supported his brother. I think sometimes he has influenced matters in such a way that he has obtained credit for settling trouble which he r.ight have pift a stop to earlier on. In 1225 Shaikh Abdulla, and a wife, went to England with Shaikh TT ar ad and his family. Shaikh Abdulla preferred his first visit. Since I have been in Bahrain Shaikh Abdulla has been consulted by Shaikh Hamad in aLiost every important matter regarding politics, oil negotiations, finance and family matters. In many cases matters of importance have been passed on by Shaikh Hamad to ryself and Shaikh Abdulla or in some cases to myself and Shaikhs Abdulla and Sulman and in all ry dealings with Shaikh Abdulla I have found him quick, diplo matic and far seeing. Shaikh Abdulla has four sons, Mohammed, Tjteshid, Ali and Kamed. Three of them used to d^ink, two of them still Jlrink. Kbne of the three elder sons are in any way distinguish- | ed and the youngest is still a boy. cCo4 /D^ -.tt- 3—r- r The eldest son of Shaikh Hamad and a v/ife who died many years ago who was £ member of the rhalifah family. Aged 42. He has very little education and very little knowledge of the outer world having never travelled anywhere except one visit to India and once to 'gypt when returning from the Haj • His outlook resembles very nearly that of his uncle 3haikh Fohaiui ad bir Tsa, his point of view is definitely that of the last generation which differs radically from the younger men of today. He has the feudal feeling, he is old enough to remember the time when conditions were very different to today, when the Bahama were regarded by the Khalifah as serfs. He does not appreciate the changed con ditions today end the fact that the people of Bahrair 5 espe cially the 'Bahama, no longer regard individual members of the Ruling FamiTV as feudal overlords. He has a strong and undisguised antipathy to the Baharnc who reclprocete this feeling. He is not progressive and /has shown no Interest in nodern innovations. He Is rather warlike byt he is not physically or mentally brave. He can be extremely obstinate. Shaikh Sulman is very good natured and has a sense of humour. He is a good mixer and gets on well with Europeans though he speaks no English. He is careful and sensible over money, not given to getting into debt but not mean. Aa a magistrate he was excellent, he has a retentive memory and knovs more about the local people than any of the senior Shaikhs- He is sympathetic towards people or communities who are illtreated, such as the divers, strongly patriotic and aggressively anti-Persian. His domestic life gives no c-use for conrrent. His view of peculiar morals, drink etc is that people should be allowed to do as they like as long as they are not found out./o &gt; T Te Is not popular ar ong the younger Fhallfah, he Is ^i^-.lkeu the Bahama but has a following among the Arabs♦ he Is frequently on bad terms with his father for reasons which often appear outwardly to be'quite trivial and is jealous of some of his younger brothers who are closer to their father. TT e does not like his uncle Abdulla. Shaikh Sulman owns more property than any of his bro- -Lersj • ost of it was gifted to him by Shaikh Tsa who was fond cf him. TT e does not take much interest in it but used constant ly a D be involved in aases with his tenants. He has two wives, ' u ^ ie i.j and two young sons by one of them. welve years ago 'haikh Sulman counted for very little. T ~ lived mostly in I,uharraq and was not friendly with his fa- tner. About 'en years ago he was appointed as a magistrate on the Bahrain court, he sat Intermittently for about s even „ ears ..u + retired two or three times until he v/as persuaded to resume the work by being given a higher salary. He worked -ai-J and vvel7 bu't in cases where Shia BahaiTia were involved he ■.'.■as not impartial « nd this was one of the main causes of the disturbances among the Bahrana ir 1935. ~ng the last three or four years Shaikh Sulman, T think greatly owing to my suggestion, has taken part in moat liodiSEZons or important matters, especially local policy, a'jrre ..jnes • h shaikh ''aiiied and the tv .'o brothers and mvself hut usually with myself and Shaikh Abdulla. On these occasions he has been very much less helpful tl an his uncles, t is was especially the case during the Zabara affair. Shaikh Sulman is handicapped by never having been to Europe, I believe it would alter his outlook considerably, fcr hotter, if he could be ^iven an opportunity of seeing some thing of European countries and administrations.Fifth son of Shaikh Hamad, his mother was a daughter of Shaikh Sulnaji bin DaiJ al Yialifah, who died when he was quite young. He is full brother of I'ubarak, Daij snd Ahmed. Age 24. He has two wives, one is a daughter of Shaikh Abdulla bin Tsa, the other a daughter of Shaikh Khalifah bin SulmaJi, by the former wife he has two sons, the eldest is about six years old. Shaikh Abdulla has had a better e ducation than any of his brothers. About twelve years ago he and T'ubarak v/ent as boarders to the Mission School at Kuwait for a term. During the year when an Indian tutor was employed to teach Shaikh Hamad*s younger sons Abdulla was the only one who showed any wish to learn and h- worked hard and made the most of his oppor tunity. For the last three years he has been having regular lessons in English and other subjects from a young Arab in the lover ment Office. He is genuinely leen on educating himself. Shaikh Abduil^a 1 s first public duty was about five years ago \ hen he was appointed as a Magistrate on the Small Joint Court. After working there for some years during which time he adquired a good idea of court work he was is: promoted to the Bahrain Court in place of Shaikh Sulman v/ho gave up doing court work. In court he is sensible careful and impartial, it is easier for him than for some of his relations to be impar tial beeause he is not involved with any of the local merchants. About two years ago he was made the President of a committee which was appointed to compose a Code of laws and regulations in response to local demand. Although the comnittee has not yet produced its Code it has done useful work in editing vari ous proclamations and rules and Shaikh Abdulla has dealt with the work and th ■ members ejks sensibly 9nd diplomatically. Four years ago Shaikh Abdulla went down to Bombay, for eye treatment, travelling through some of the native states en route. In 1936 he accompanied his father to England, in his/-his case the visit v/as a most valuable experience, he was very observant, and showed a keen interest in all he saw including hospitals, schools, law courts and all the visible sijns of western civilization. Shaikh Abdulla has now obtained rather reluctant permission from his father to go to England for six months or a year to learn English. Shaikh Abdulla is in many ways typical of the present dsy young Arab of Bahrain. His point of view differs enormous ly fBom the point of view of the last generation. He is too young to remember Shaikh Tsa's regime and therefore has no regrets for the past. Having grown up since the introduction of existing government institutions he regards such things as courts, r unicipalities, police, rules and regulations, all of which are comparatively recent, as though they had always exist ed. His older relations still consider many of these reforms as new and unv/elcome changes. He is interested in outside affairs and reads books and newspapers. He is broad minded and tolerant and has not the violent dislike of the Shia Ba hama which characterises so many of his relations. He is liked by the public who consider that his judgments in the court are fair. He often takes part In discussions with Kadis or deputations about court matters and on these occasions he argues s ensibly. Physically he is fairly strong but very short sighted, he was attended by Duke Elder in London. Since he married he has lived a quiet respectable life. He is very anxious that his children should be properly educated. He is not extravagant but rather fond of money. He takes an interest in his garden and town property and has lately built a number of shops. It is difficult to e stimate the value of his popularity, his father is fond of him and depends more upon him than he used to. He is on good terms with his young cousins but the older Shaikhs/-Shaikhs resent his 'being on the Bahrain Court except Shaikh Has':id bin 1'ohammad who supports him strongly. He and his brother Sulman are not friendly.INDLn. OPPICE, ? -^3758/38 Cu_ idential. dushire residency. No Date. CO^F'DENTIAL RECORDS HHITESLJjL LONDON, S.-J.l. 31st May, 1938.

In the course of a visit to Shaikh Sir Hamad bin r Isa this morning the latter mentioned that he had a very important subject which he wished to discuss with Belgrave and myself in private. The room was cleared and His Highness proceeded to say that he thought it might be desirable if he nominated a Wali-Ahad. He asked for advice and, though I said I must necessarily obtain your views before giving him any official advice, he pressed me to say what I thought personally as his friend. Accordingly I replied that I thought it would be a very good thing indeed if he would nominate his successor# It would put an end to the type of intrigue which goes on in which agitators attempt to make play with the names of the two main candidates for the Shaikhdom and to the whispers that go around that Shaikh Abdullah and Shaikh Salman are (separately) supporting agitation for their own ends; and generally it would clear the air, and remove cause for doubt and misgiving. Shaikh Hamad expressed appreciation and asked me to obtain official advice from you on this matter. He added that he intended to consult us also about the actual person to be nominated (assuming that he is advised to proceed with the idea). 3/- i 5} e Honourable Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Trenchard Fowle, K.C.I.E., C.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.A it 3. His Highness* proposal is not quite as surprising as it would have been three or four months ago. The younger members of the Family have been at him to make a nomination and he has been greatly concerned at the rumours first that Shaikh Salman and afterwards that Shaikh Abdullah were tacitly supporting the agitation which has been going on, even though he does not believe them. I have on various occasions mentioned to you that I thought it was a great pity that Shaikh Hamad would not nominate his successor, and now that he has come to the point I would strongly urge that he be encouraged to do so. Admittedly we must side-step any attempt by him to involve us in the nomination, but that should not be difficult; at the worst it could be indicated that we should be quite content to see Shaikh Abdullah bin 1 Isa or either of his sons Shaikh Salman and Shaikh Abdullah so nominated. Indeed there might be advantages in so doing. These three are recognised as the on only possible candidates, and/Shaikh Hamad making his selection His Majesty's Government might 'take note n of it, without any possible danger of committing themselves to the active support of the nominee in the event of a disputed succession. In f'9o point of fact, as I have said in paragraph 6 of my letter No. C/15-l.a/16 dated the 6th January 1938, a nomination would almost certainly settle finally the question of the succession here. 4.

Shaikh Hamad* s declared intention of consulting us about the actual individual to be nominated as his successor is probably prompt- ed by a desire, which he will then formulate, that His Majesty's Grovernnent should recognise this successor. j.iiis in my opinion His Majesty 's Government should not do. 4o I suggest that I be authorised to instruct tfaightman to inform Shaikh Hamad verbally as followsj (a) His Majesty's (Jovernment are of the opinion that it would be a wise provision for Shaikh Hbmad to appoint a successor* (b) should Shaikh H&amp;mad take the further step of consulting us as to the actual individual to be nominated Weight man should reply that His Majesty's Government are of the / Aubrey Metcalfe, KCIB.,GSI.,MVO., 3eo»etary to the Government of India, ©eternal Affairs Department, New Delhi.3*) H lb —2— the opinion timt this is, of coarse, entirely a matter for the Shaikh to decide, but presumably the Shaikh's choice will fall on Shaikh Abdullah bin 1 Isa or either of his sons, Shaikh Salman or Shaikh Abdullah. (c) Should Shaikh Hamad ask for the recognition indicated in paragraph 3 above nightman should reply that His MaJ esty* s Government, while they take note of Shaikh Hamad's decision, cannot grant this prior recognition since to do so would be against their general policy concerning succession in the Arab States of the Persian Gulf. 5.

I saw His Highness on the 18th March and informed him that His Majesty 1 s Government, the Government of India and you all thought that his plan of appointing an heir-apparent was admirable. He v/as pleased, but immediately invited me to tell him whom he should nominate, his brother or his son. After a good deal of argument I induced him to realise that he alone must make the selection betv/een these two. 3. I now hear that he v/ants to make the nomination in writing, without telling the Family that he has done so, to get me to wit ness it and to deposit either the original deed or a copy with me. He shrinks from making a public nomination, since he fears the reproaches of the unsuccessful candidate. 4. I am afraid that there is very little prospect of getting him to change his mind again and to nominate publicly. On the other hand it is obviously most desirable that a nomination should be made, even if the paper on which it is written is locked away until his death. At the same time it is of the utmost importance that no allegation should be made later that .ie has been influenced by the Political Agent5 and equally there must be no question of the authenticity of the document. In order to meet these desiderata I suggest the following procedure. The Honourable Lieutenant-Colonel His/- Sir Trenchard Fowle, K.C.I.E., C.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. O */ 3 His Highness might have a document written out, leaving the name blank; he could then summon the leading members of the A1 Khalifah Family to a meeting at which I myself should be present. He could inform them that he was making this nomina tion which would remain secret until his death, and then every one v ^oulcl be sent to 'the other end of the room while he wrote in the name. The paper could then be folded over and all pre sent could sign as witnesses; it could then be placed in an envelope and sealed, and handed to me, and I should deposit it in the Eastern Bank. I myself (alone) should know the name of the successor, merely in order to be certain that His Highness had not nominated-someone quite unsuitable. 5. By this procedure we can ensure that the nomination is made, we could avoid any subsequent charge of undue influence, and there would be no question raised later that the document was not authentic. If you approve of this, I should be grateful for early orders as I anticipate that His Highness will ask to discuss the matter with me in the very near future.

The cru.x of the problem Ilea in the laat sentence of your paragraph 4: •♦I myself (alone) ahould know the name of the auccesaor, merely in order to be certain that Hia Highneas had not nominated someone quite unauitable 1 *. If we were certain that he vouxd nominate either Abdulla bin laa or Salman, or even hia a on Abdulla, any of ^rhom would auit ua (vide paragraph 4 ( b) of my demi-official letter No.678-3, dated the 7th December 1938 to Metcalfe), the courae could be followed of leaving tne Shaikh / to Veightman quire. I.e.3., Political \gent, Bahrain.I I I4 &amp;S t^ -2- to #rite out his own nomination and lodge it himself in the bank, ^ as you indicate the Shaikh would probably want the docu ment witnessed. You should certainly not witness it, and it would be undesirable, I think, for 3elgrave to do so, while if any Arab witnesses It,the nomination will certainly not remain a secret. Is it absolutely necessary for it to be witnessed ?) This course would be distinctly preferable to your having any hand in the matter. if you do, even under the precautions suggested in your paragraph 4 it will certainly get about in Bahrain with embroidery from the family that you, on behalf of His lajesty^ Oovernment and myself, rigged the succession. This would have an extremely bad effect locally and, whoever the successor vas, would certainly tend to make him unpopular with some, at all events, of the local elements. 5. if the coarse suggested above were followed I do not suppose that the Shaikh would care to divulge to his family the fact of its having been carried out, since he would probably be badgered by his relations, including his wife, to reveal his selection. If he felt like this he could postpone revealing to his family until on his death-bed the fact of the selection having been made, tne name of the heir, and the fact that the document was deposited in the bank. 6. it would be important for the Political Agent to know ^hom the Shaijch had selected and I suggest that in the course of some interview the latter could merely inform you privately and ve. bally of the name of his selection. I think we can trust Hamad to tell the truth. o/c 4■L Dated the 12th April 1939. mJSHIRE RESIDENCY. No r '/V 3 ^ ^NFID^NTIAL RECORDS Will you please refer to your demi-official letter No. 287-S of the 31st March 1939 on the subject of the Bahrain Succession ? 2. I had some further discussion with His Highness on this matter this morning and he is still very anxious that everything should be kept entirely secret. He wanted to write out his nomination and to hand it to me to b e kept until it is wanted and I had a little difficulty in explaining to him that this would scarcely be to the advantage of his successor. However in the end he did agree that the document had better be lodged in the bank. 3. His Highness said that he wanted to consult the actual documents drawn up when he himself was nominated as heir - apparent and he promised to show these to me. T did not therefore raise the question of witnesses to-day and shall wait until I have seen these old papers. This is therefore a purely interim report.

I&gt; The circumstances in which the present Shaikh of Bahrain (Shaikh Hamad) came to be recognised as successor designate to the Chiefship by His Majesty's Grovernment were as follows. jc iatLer fro# lc ^ ^ sa » father of the present Shaikh, |irftLoVersian ent S6nt hiS SOn t0 interviev; the Political Resident with jfndia^Forei^n 0 ^ I ^ ot ^ ect seCurin 8 recognition by the British Eafeo c; 0 ifi697 ^Qvemment. The Resident informed Shaikh Hamad that it would be necessary for his father to address him statin^ what his wishes were and that the Shaikh's propo sals would be forwarded for the consideration of G-overnm if sufficiently strong reasons were urged. On 7th February 1698 Shaikh Ssa wrote to the Resident enclosing ^a copy ol his will in which he declared the appointment c.f. letter from the Pol. Resident in the Persian Gulf No. 57-^.,^ wi toarrf ' t, % of his son as heir apparent. The will was attested — ibio — by 44 of the leading men of Bahrain. Before referring the matter to the G-overnment of India the Political Resident asked for the views of local officers with particular regard to the custom and practice obtaining among Arab tribes relative to succession to Shaikhship and the probable reaction of the people of Bahrain and the surrounding tribes to a recognition by us of Shaikh Hamad. The general view appeared to be that whilst there was no recognised rule governing succession which in many cases was determined by financial and other considerations and by the approval of the elders of the tribe^, it was usual for the bhaikh's nominee to be regarded as his successor and particularly so in the case of tribes dependent on, or tributory to, another x-ower lor its peaceful existence. As Bahrain was regarded generally as a British protectorate, it was anticipated ....- 2 - c.f. letter from tlie Pol. Resident in Persian G-ulf dated 15 1696. ^ - £ Hi* a No. 194 of 1696. r anticipated that G-overnment's support of Shaikh Hamad's claims to uhaikhahip would not only be viewed favourably but would also ensure a peaceful succession c.na increase our influence without augmenting our responsibilities. 3. In recommending the Shaikh's request to the G-overnment of India, the Political Resident expressed tnes opinion that the time has come to take a more decided position in Bahrain than we have hitherto done, and that the treaty engagements entered into between the British (government and the Shaikhs of Bahrain, followed by more recent closer relations, appear to justify an intimation by the British aovernment that the status of Bahrain towards the Government of India is identical with that of protected Native States in India'. It %as argued that if this was done the recognition of shaikh Hamad would merely follow prece- oent oiten aaopted in India* Further reasons urged were that the succession was approved by many of the elders of the tribes, a peaceful succession without the inevitable family quarrels which ensue on the demise of a Luuhamnadan ruler; and that recognition would otrengtnen the position of Shaikh Hamad. Another (and at the time not unimportant) reason mooted was that the recognition v/ould effectually put an end to Turkey's pretensions in regard to Bahrain. 4» ihe quesbion was examined by the Government of India and the manner in which it was dealt with is • v briefly explained in their despatch to Secretary of tate. dated the 27th October 1696. It may, however, ue mentioned that the matter was fully discussed from the point of view of the constitutional issue raisedc .f • Govt, of India's despatch No . 194 dated 27-^0.1696 • * ¥.o. 44. h*&gt;t c.fbetter from the .^vt. of India No. 205-S.i. dsied 7.2. by the Political Resident that M a more decided position in Bahrain' should be taken and that an intimation should be made that the 'status of Bahrain towards the Government of India is identical with that of protected Nstive States in India*. It was pointed that the intention was to establish an exclusive protectorate over Bahrain. The Government of India were not in favour of this surest ion and held that in view of the existing Treatv engagements with Bahrain our position in respect of Bahrain did not stand in need of revision: while it was a maxim of general policy to avoid interference in the internal affairs of a Chiefship and particularly in dynastic disputes. It was, however decided to support the recognition of Shaikh Hamad on the grounds that the weakness of Shaikh Ssa^ rule had given rise in the past to intrigues for the restoration of the exiled branch of his family and that in the event of the succession remaining undecided there might have been risk of disturbances, on the Shaikhs death, which would have been detrimental to British interests. * 5. The Secretary of State in his despatch dated 16th December 1696 expressed the approval of Kis L-Iajesty's Government to the proposed recognition of Shaikh Eamad» The decision was conveyed to Political Resident on 7th February 1699 and he was told at the same time that, without extending a British protectorate over Bahrain, the Government of India were 'prepared to consider proposals to improve the arrangement for the discharge of local political auties in the island'. 6» ....

British Government should recognise his eldest) taxttax son. Sheikh Hamed, as successor designate to the Chiefship► Lieutenant-Colonel Meade is of opinion tnat it is desirable to take a more decided position in respect to Bahrein: he recommends that we should accede to the 3heikh T s request, and that advantage should be taken of the opportunity to secure control of the customs of Bahrein and to appoint, as our representative in the island, a political Officer of higher rank than our present 4gent. 2. The Gnief of Bahrein is bound, under the terms of the vide Aitchison's Treaties, ..Ureement si^ied on the &amp;c (3rd jkiition), Yol.X, pa^es 120-i21. 22nd December 1880, ! to abstain from entering into negotiations or making treaties of any sort with any State or Government other than the British Vvithout the consent of the said British Gr-overnment, and to refuse permission to any other Government than the British to establish diplomatic or consular agencies or caaling depots 1 in his territory, without similar consent.

Under these circumstances, it does not a^ear to us that our position in ros^eco uo Bahrein stands in need of revision; while it is raaiim of general policy to avoid interference in the internal affairs of a Ghiefship and particularly in dynastic disputes, 'he '■.eaknesslpf the present Sheikh's rule has, however, + ^ee despatch T rom the Fiven riap + *■« xi x Government of India, No. 0 in the ^ ast 19:., dated the 23rd October 1874.past to intrigues for the restoration of the exiled branch of his family; he has four sons; and, if the succession remains undecided, there may be risk of disturbances, on the Sheikh's death, which would be detrimental to British interests. On the whole therefore, ^nd taking into considerat ion the opinions of txie local officers as recorded in the ^ 9U enclosures to the Political Resident's letter of the 13th June 1898, we are disposed, as at present advised, to authorise the recognition of Sheikh Hamed as heir to the Chief ship; but, before replying to Lieutenant-Colonel Meade, we desire to learn whether Her Majesty's Grovernmont have any advice or instructions to offer at the present sta^e.t * Telegram Q* From Political, Bahrain.

For several years Shaikh Hamad had been in poor health. When he was in London in 1936 he visited the leading medical authority on diabetes and had a course of treatment and was recommended a diet and regular doses of insulin. After his return to Bahrain he was treated by Dr. R. Holmes and later by the State Medical Officer, Dr. R.H.B.Snow. An Indian dresser from the government hospital was allotted to him and was in attendance wherever Shaikh Hamad was living. The insulin treatment was carried out un ceasingly but in spite of incessant warnings, requests and reminders from his medical attendants, his rela tions, servants and myself Shaikh Hamad practically ignored the rules of his diet which had been laid down. One of his few concessions in the matter of diet was abstention from sweet tea, which he had never liked, and from sweets and sweet cakes on public occasions. He continued recklessly to eat quantities of rice and dates, especially during the fresh date season. He used to be a very light eater but towards the end of his life he ate heavily. In consequence of this it became necessary to increase the quantity of insulin which was given to him until at the end he was receiving abnormally large doses. About two years ago - it is difficult to decide any actual date - it became notice able that Shaikh Hamad had become very stiff on his left side, both his arm and his leg being affected. It was for this reason that he found it comfortable to use the small arm®^' chairs which he kept in the palace. -8- at Manamah and at Sakhir, He used to lever himself with both arms when rising from the chair. He never discussed this matter but it was commented on by his servants. After he died his household servants said that twice before he had attacks which reduced him to a state of unconsciousness for a short time but these incidents were not made public at the time and consi derable vagueness exists as to their dates. On the whole, considering his physical liabilities his general health had been well maintained. His heart however always required careful watching, and during the last six months its condition had been slowly and insidiously showing signs of strain. On Monday 16th February 1942 the annual celebra tion of the anniversary of Shaikh Hamad*s accession day was held, owing to the war the only public event was a ceremonial parade of the state forces in front of the ■oalace. On the previous day Shaikh Hamad discussed the programme with me and said that as he found that walking tired him so much he did not intend to pass down the lines but would remain seated throughout the parade. He had been suffering for some days from a swollen rheumatic ankle and though Dr. Snow and I per sonally asked him to keep his leg resting on a chair he neglected the advice and twice during the few days before the parade I found him sitting in the gate room at Sakhir not resting his leg. The parade was held on Monday 16th. Various people commented on the fact that Shaikh Hamad did not look well. When it was over he drove back to Rumaitha where he was staying for some days in order to enjoy the results of the recent rain. Rumaitha is a little valley in the high country towards the south end of the —the island, here during recent years Shaikh Hamad built a small hunting lodge, a mosque and some out houses and spent much of his time. Dr» Snow visited Shaikh Hamad on Tuesday afternoon and found him in good spirits and with no unusual symptoms. On the same evening at about 8-30 Shaikh Hamad had a stroke. He was praying in his house and one of his personal servants was present when he fell on his side, unconscious. The man summoned the other servants end they managed to lay him down comfortably. None of the relations were present. Messengers were sent in for Dr. Snow and Dr. Holmes, who happened to be staying in Bahrain and for Shaikh Hamad's sons and brothers. When I heard the news, next morning, I went out to Rumaitha. I found Shaikhs Mohomed, Abdullah and Salman in the outer room with some of the sons and great many of the family outside the house. I stayed there most of the morning and made certain arrangements about additional guards on the room in Sakhir where Shaikh Hamad kept a very large amount of gj_3_Y0P and gold. Before I left I saw Shaikh Hamad who was in a state of coma. During Wednesday and Thursday and until he died shortly after midday on Friday Dr. Snow, Dr. Holmes and Dr. Harrison took turns on duty at Rumaitha. During most of the time the sons and brothers were present but when he actually died none of them were there. On Thursday evening Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa came to see me and discussed the possibility of Shaikh Hamad recovering. Nothing of a political nature was mentioned. On Friday at about 1 p.m. I received a telephone message from Dr. Holmes at Awali telling me that Shaikh Hamad was dead. I informed the Agency andand went to Rumaitha taking my secretary Mr. Narayan. Before going I gave orders for all flags to be flown at half mast in order that the public should know what had happened. I stopped on the way at Shaikh Salman's house at Rafaa, he had gone to Rumaitha but the news was not known there. A little distance from Rumaitha I met a long pro cession of about 60 cars with the Bahrain Petroleum Company^ ambulance in the centre. I turned off the road. The leading car and the whole procession stopped and Shaikhs Mohomed, Abdullah and Salman got out and had a conversation with me on the roadside, Shaikh Mohomed was the spokesman and he told me that he wished me to know at once that the family had chosen Shaikh Salman to succeed his father and now they were taking Shaikh Hamad to the cemetery at Rafaa. They asked me to follow their car. All along the road the proces sion was joined by cars which had been going out to Rumaitha. The procession turned off the main road across the desert to the little cemetery near the Hanaini well in the valley below Rafaa. Shaikh Abdul— latif, one of the Sunni Qadis, was waiting here with a great crowd of people, all the inhabitants of the two Rafaas. On the cliffs below the fort there were many hundreds of women. The service was taken by Shaikh Abdullatif, Shaikh Hamad was buried close to the grave of Shaikh Salman bin Ahmad who was the second ruler of Bahrain and who lived early in the 19th century. Among the large crowd of people who were present were Dr. Snow and Dr. Harrison, Jews, Indians, Persians and Arabs. After the funeral I returned to Manamah. On the way I met several cars full of people driving out to-5- &amp; 'to Rafaa among 'them Shaikh Khalifah bin Salman, Shaikh Hamad's nephew, son of an older brother, who was very angry and upset at not having been told the time and place of the funeral. Hearing that large crowds had collected at the Muharraq and Manamah cemeteries I telephoned to the police, from Rafaa, giving orders that people were to be told that the funeral had taken place. On the same night, at about 8 p.m. I took the document which Shaikh Hamad had written appointing Shaikh Salman as his successor from the safe custody of the Eastern Bank and went to see Shaikh Salman at Rafaa. I had a private conversation with him and delivered the document which he read. He said he had heard something about a document being written by his father but he did not know what it was about. He then told me that on the previous night Shaikh Abdullah came to see him alone and had said that if Shaikh Hamad died Shaikh Salman should succeed him and he would support Shaikh Salman. Shaikh Salman said he had at first refused the suggestion but after discussion he had been prevailed upon to agree on con dition that all the family supported him. He also described how after his father's death, at Rumaitha, Shaikhs Mohomed and Abdullah took him aside and told him that he should now become Shaikh and that they would support him, they promised to be loyal to him and behave towards him in the same way as they had to his father. They then returned to the other sons and the relations who were present and Shaikh Mohomed told the family that Shaikh Salman was now Shaikh and asked whether anybody had any objection. The other brothers -IV * m -6- brothers and the cousins unanimously signified their consent# They then mounted their cars and drove to the cemetery. Shaikh Salman appeared to be pleased and re lieved to find that Shaikh Hamad had appointed him as his successor. He spoke for a long time about his duties and his responsibilities which, he said, consisted of three chief obligations, to protect and preserve the rights of the Ruling Family, to look after the interests of his people with fairness and justice and to preserve the friendship with the British Government, He said he had told his uncles and brothers that he would undertake these three chief duties. He said he wished everything to continue as it had in his father's time and did not want any changes made. Regarding the document itself he said he would like his two uncles to seal it, showing their approval and would also like it signed by the Political Agent, perhaps after his uncles had signed it. He said neither they nor anybody else had any knowledge of this document although some knew that a document about something had been signed by the late Ruler. Shaikh Salman spoke of my service to his father and said that he wished me to remain with him in the same capacity as I held with Shaikh Hamad, On the following day the Shaikhs remained in their houses receiving visits of condolence. On Sunday Shaikhs Salman, Mohomed and Abdullah came to the Adviserate. Shaikh Mohomed arrived first and told me again what Shaikh Salman had told me on the previous night, he emphasized that the family were unanimous in wanting Shaikh SaQnian and he thought he —-7- he was the best, if he had had any doubts he would not have hesitated to make them known. He reminded me that he had told me sometime ago that he himself had never aspired to be Shaikh. He did not remind me that at about that time he told me that he thought Shaikh Abdullah should be the successor. Shaikh Abdullah and Shaikh Salman came later, there was a good deal of talk about the Ruler's duties towards the family. They told me that they had decided that Shaikh Hamad should be buried at Rafaa because most of the family were buried there. They discussed the document and the uncles said that they had both sealed it and they spoke a good deal about carrying out the wishes of Shaikh Hamad. All three asked me to remain as Adviser. After returning from the Agency they drafted a number of replies to telegrams and I suggested that it was desirable that some sort of proclamation should be published in order to let everyone know that Shaikh Salman had succeeded his father. A proclamation was then drafted, written by Shaikh Mohomed who suggested adding to it the sentence about the British Government which they all agreed upon. The proclamation was based upon the gist of the document which Shaikh Hamad signed and the wording in this was copied almost ver batim from the document in which Shaikh Isa appointed Shaikh Hamad as Heir Apparent over forty years ago. The matter of the estate, which is large and affec ted by family custom, was not touched upon# Shaikh Abdullah reminded Shaikh Salman that he would have to give up his seat as President of the Muharraq Municipality and as President of the Minors* Department. It was agreedagreed that we should meet again on Thursday, At present public opinion is generally in favour of Shaikh Salman, who, it is thought, is the best choice among the family but unlikely to acquire the affection in which his father was held. He is not and never has been liked by his brothers, who are mostly very much younger than him. When the fact was first known there was consternation in the house holds of many of the Shaikhs but since then Shaikh Salman has seen or sent messages to a number of re lations and people who were dependent upon his father promising to look after them. Shaikh Mohomed and Shaikh Abdullah, especially the former, have let it be seen very clearly that they do not contemplate any withdrawal from the control of the State. I think this is a good thing. Actually for several years the two uncles and Shaikh Salman and myself have constituted a sort of unofficial State Council for dealing with all matters of importance which were invariably handed over to us for consideration by Shaikh Hamad. The matter over which there may be friction is Shaikh Hamad 1 s estate and Shaikh Saljnan's administration of his Privy Purse. A certain faction mostly in Muharraq including some local merchants and younger members of the Ruling Family also most of the 'Shubban' (young men tT ) are extremely disappointed that Shaikh Abdullah did not become Ruler. The Bahama are intensely relieved that neither Shaikh Mohomed nor Shaikh Abdullah have come into power. There was an idea current mainly among the Bahama that Shaikh Hamad would be the last Khalifah Ruler and that after him the British would take —-9- 5&gt; take over Bahrain. Apparently the Bahama viewed this prospect with equanimity. On the whole the Bahama are glad that Shaikh Salman has succeeded partly because they feared and disliked so much the prospect of being ruled by either of his uncles. The Bahama have never liked the Ruling Family for religious and political reasons but they were fond of Shaikh Hamad who always treated them well and granted them many privileges which they had not enjoyed before. During Shaikh Hamad*s illness there was much conjecture as to who would succeed him. The chances of Shaikhs Mohomed, Abdullah, Salman and Daij were discussed, the last was well known to be his father's favourite son and has the reputation of having something of his father's disposition. Shaikh Salman's popularity will depend much upon his treatment of the family and the people. One of the things which caused general irritation was Shaikh Hamad's lavish generosity to foreign Arabs, Bedouin and Q.attaris. Shaikh Salman never sympathised with this and it is possible that he will discontinue patronising them. Adviser to the Government. Adviserate, February 26, 1942.11 s I Copy of letter 1T o.

The Agency, Bahrain| the 13th March 1942* Prom K^BoWakefield Bsquire, I*C»So ^ Political Agent 9 Bahrain* To The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Camp, Bahrain* Sir | I have the honour to submit a report on the death of His Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad bin # Isa al Khallfah, K.C»I»3# f C*S*I* 9 Ruler of Bahrain, and the succession of his eldest son, His Highness Shaikh Salman bin Hamad al Khallfaho 2# The last occasion on which I saw Shaikh Hamad was on the 16th February, 1942, when a ceremonial parade of the State Forces was held in front of the Palace at Manamah to mark the tenth anniversary of his accession, had I had also /an interview with the Shaikh on the 15th February when we discussed in some detail the war situ- atlon, with particular reference to the impending fall of Singapore. It seemed to me, on both these occasions, that His Highness 1 general health was not good and that the improvement which followed his hawking expediuton in Saudi Arabia earlier in the winter had not been maintained* / 3* I j rIV 3 # on the 17th February I left Bahrain hy air for a week t s tour of the Trucial Coast • On the afternoon of February 19th, on fly return to Sharjah from Aba Dhabi, I found awaiting me a telegram from Kr^Jackaon, Assistant Political Agent, Bahrain, informing me that Shaikh Hamad had had a stroke on February 17th and had not, by the afternoon of February 18th (when the telegram was des patched), recovered consciousness. By the courtesy of Squadron Leader Kewall, Officer Commanding, R*A*F• st.at.ion, Sharjah, I was enabled to return to Bahrain on the morning of February 20th in a service aeroplanej and I actually arrived at Bahrain about a quarter of an hour after His Highness Shaikh Hamad had died* 4* It appears that after the ceremonial parade on the afternoon of February 16th His Highness Shaikh Hamad had driven out to his country house at Rumaitha. At 8 &lt;&gt;30 p»m# on the following day, February 17th, he had a stroke while he was saying his prayers, and fell on his aide, unconscious* Hear relatives and doctors were at once summoned* Dr.Snow (State Medical Officer), Dr. Holmes (Residency Surgeon) and Dro Harrison (American Mission) attended the Shaikh and one of them was always with him until, without having re covered consciousness, he eventually died at about 12*15 p*m on Friday, February 20th. At the time of his death only Dr* Holmes airl one or two servants were present* Members of the family had left the house a little earlier to take their mid-day meal. The funeral was held the same after noon, the burial taking place at the cemetery at Rafa 1 * Shaikh Hamad's age at the time of his death is not known exactly. It is believed, however, that he was in his seventieth year* Those who sent telegrams of condolence included the Kings of Egypt, Iraq and Saudi Arabia, Her Royal Highness Princess Alice and the Karl of Athlone, His Majesty's Qovernment and His Excellency the Viceroy* / 5*5* It bad 1&gt;«aQ 6*p9ct®&lt;i tha't when Shaikh ;ia;aa(i dlad the succession would be disputed. In fact, however, ShaiKh Salman assumed the reins of govemunent with the unanimous consent of the Khallfah family and without objection on the part of any class of his subjects. Tha t.i*audi«ion from one rule to another has. Indeed, been so peaceful, so free from the displays of partisan spirit which normally mark such occasions in Arab Shaikhdoms, that it may be of interest t.o record in some detail the steps by *iich It was accom plished. 6„ On the evening of February 19th, while Shaikh Hamad was still lying in a state of c oma. Shaikh Abdullah paid a private visit to Shaikh Salman. ShaiWi Abdullah, it will be recalled, is the younger of Shaikh Salman's two uncles and had been commonly regarded as Shaikh Sal man's most dsngerous rival In a disputed succession. Shaikh Abdullah, in the course of his interview with Shalich Salman, urged that he. Shaikh Salman, should succeed Shaikh Tiomori if Shaikh Hanad did not recover from his stroke? and he promised his full support to Shaikh Salman. After discussion Shaikh Salman agreed to take his father's place on condition that all the family supported him. It la not known whether Shaikh Mohammad (Shaikh Salman's elder uncle) was privy to Shaikh Abdullah's overtures before they were made, but immediately after Shaikh Hamad's death, when the family collected at Rumaitha, Shaikhs Mohammad and Abdullah took Shaikh Salman aside and told ha/n that, they regarded him as the natural successor of Shaikh Hama-l and that they would support him loyally in the same way aa they had supported his father. The three Shaikhs then rejoined the other members of the family who were present and Mohammad, announcing that Shaikh Salman would succeed Shaikh Hamad, asked whether any one had any objection / The/ 8* The members of the family, seeing that Shaikh Salman had the support of his two ancles (the most inflaentlal and respected members of the Khallfah family), unanimously signified their acceptance of Shaikh Salman. 7* In the late afternoon of February 20th MfoBelgrave Informed me that the Khallfah family had chosen Shaikh Salman to succeed his father* I did not know at that time what part Shaikh Abdullah had played In the s election of Shaikh Salman, nor had I reason to suppose that any of the Khallfah family knew the contents of Shaikh Hamad's testament appoint ing Shaikh Salman to succeed him* It seemed to me that Shaikh Salman had already gone a considerable way to estab lishing himself In his father's place and that, If the con tents of Shaikh Hamad t s testament were known. Shaikh Salman 1 s position would become secure against any possible rival* I therefore asked lCr»Belgrave to secure Shaikh Hamad's testa ment from the local branch of the Eastern Bank, where It was lying In safe custody, and to take It to Shaikh Salman Immediately* Some difficulty was experienced In obtaining from the Bank the sealed envelope containing Shaikh Hamad's testament but eventually Mr•Belgrave secured the envelope and, having arranged a private interview with Shaikh Salman, delivered it to h**™ at 8 p»nu Shaikh Salman was both pleased and relieved to find that his father had appointed him his successor. He said that neither he nor any other member of the family had any knowledge of Shaikh Hamad's testament although one or two people knew that Shaikh Hamad had on one occasion signed an important document* He said that he would try to get his two uncles to endorse the document in token of their acceptance of its contents and that he would also like it to be signed by the Political Agent*- 5 - 80 On the morning of February 21st I paid the custofoary visits of condolence) first to Shaikh Saliitti 9 then to Shaikh Mohammad, then to Shaikh Abdullah, end finally to Shaikh Rashld bin Mohammad, father-itwlaw of the late Baler. The order In which these visits were paid was taken, no doubt, to be an Indication of the attitude which His Majesty's Government were likely to adopt towards the succession: But in my conversations with the Shaikhs I strictly avoided any reference, direct or Indirect, to that subject. When I arrived at Rafa* to call on Shaikh Salman he introduced me to his seven brothers* In the course of our conversation, which was mostly about Shaikh Hamad and his many fine qualities, Shaikh Salman expiressed his determination to follow as closely as possible in his father's footsteps• In par ticular, owri in an emphatic manner, he gave an under taking that he and his brothers would always be friendly and faithful to the British Government. During ay call on Shaikh Mohammad he told ma that he would gt^fe his full support to Shaikh Salman whom he now regarded as the Head of the P«Bily. Helther Shaikh Abdullah nor Shaikh Rashld made any reference to Shaikh Salman and his ne^ position. 9 0 on the mining of the 22nd February Shaikh Sal- man and his two uncles, accompanied by Mr.Belgrave, came to see me at the Agency. I met Shfii 1 ^aXman, who walked ahead of the others, at the place at which the Political Agent normally receives the Ruler of Bahrain} but in «y conversation I avoided the use of nonorifi^s •to which only the Baler of Bahrain is entitled. the usual preliminary courtesies Shaikh Salman gave ma formal intimation that his family had unanimously selected him to succeed his father. Shaikhs Mohammad and Abdullah / confirmed/el 6 - confirmed this and added that nowhere In Bahrain, either among the Khalifah family or among the populace, was there a single dissentient voice* Shaikh Salman then informed me that he had set before himself three main objectives* These were *- (1) Loyally to preserve the existing ties of friendship with the British Government; (2) To respect the rights both of members of his family and of his individual subjects; and (3) To promote the public welfare by all means in his power* He expressed his determination to be loyal to the British connection and to implement all undertakings given by the previous Rulers of Bahrain; and he spontaneously offered te be guided by any advice which the Political Agent might ten~ der to him* In reply I expressed pleasure at hearing his declaration of friendship and loyalty; and I promised that, for ay part, I would always deal with him frankly and openly so that nothing would be hidden between us and there could never be any misunderstanding; and I further told him that I would report at once to the Honourable the Resident in the Persian Gulf the sentiments that he had expressed to me and the fact that his aaccession had the unanimous support of his family and people* Before taking his leave Shaikh Salman told me in detail of his father's last hours, and praised the devotion of the doctors who attended him* He also ex pressed his gratitude for the help which lfr*BeIgrave had given to his father in the past mod was now giving to him* 10* In the afternoon of February 22nd Shaikh Salman Issued a proclamation announcing that he had 'taken over the role of Bahrain 11 in accordance with the wish and behest of / Shaikh7 - Shaikh Hamad and with the approval of his ancles, his brothers and of his tribe. The Proclamation contained the following wc hall continue to strengthen the prove# ties with the British Snpire, and shall always maintain Its friendship'o Mr# Belgrave consulted me unofficially before the proclamation was Isaoed. To delay Its Isaae would have been to promote locally speculation and disquiet; if, on the other hand, i were officially to authorise its Issue I should be anticipating the decision of His Majesty's Government. X decided that, on the whole | the Issue of the proclamation was justified since His Majesty's Government were deflnltel|r opposed to official interference in the suceesaion - though, of course, they could wlthold recognition of a successor if they so wished: Moreover, there was reason to believe that His Majesty's Government would welcome Shaikh Salman as Ruler of Bahrain and would, therefore, welcome any step which helped to establish him firmly and peaceably In that position* I therefore suggested to Mr •Belgrave that the proclamation should be Issued without reference to me* 11* The formal recognition of His Majesty's Government and the Government of India to the succession of His Highness Shaikh Salman was comnonicated to the Shaikh In a letter which I personally handed to him on the 1st of March, 1942* His Highness was very pleased at the prompt recognition of his succession and expressed the hope, which I cordially reclpro~ cated, that I should always be the bearer of good tidings* 12* It Is satisfactory that Shaikh Hamad's successor has established himslef as Ruler of Bahrain without the active Intervention of the Political Agent* The only positive steps which l took to assist the course of events were my request to Mr •Belgrave that he should take Immediate steps / te• 8 - /Z1 to place Shaikh Hamad's testament in Shaikh Salman's hands, and opt unofficial concurrence In the Issue of Shaikh Salman* s proclamation of February 22nd. 1 should like to place on record, however, that the responsibilities which devolved on me when Shaikh Hamad died were greatly lightened by the knowledge of the policy to be pursued in such a contingency which 1 derived from study of the records of 1938 and 1939 when, It will be recalled, the question of a successor to Shaikh Hamad was discussed from every angle* As matters have turned out Shaikh Hamad's testament appointing his eldest son to succeed him has proved fortunate as the terms of that testament have added the sanction of Shaikh Hanad's authority to the independent choice of the Khalifah family; and the testament which Mr» Weightman was at such pains to secure from Shaikh Hamad has proved an invaluable asset to Shaikh Salman in securing general assent to his succession* In slightly altered circumstances, however. Shaikh Hamad's testament (the secret of which was almost too well kept) might have proved an embarrassment* If, for instance, at the interview between Shaikhs Salman and Abdullah before Shaikh Hamad died, the decision had been that Shaikh Abdullah should succeed, it would have been very difficult for the Political Agent to know whether to withhold the testament •» and be guilty of duplicity - or produce It - and create strife* A similar difficulty would have ariaen if, events occurring as they have occurred, Shaikh Hamad's testament had been in favour of Shaikh Abdullah* The factor which was not, and could not have been, foreseen was that the question of the succession would virtually be decided before Shaikh Hamad was dead, and, therefore, before the contents of his testament could be known* Happily, however, the / secretsecret choice of Shaikh Hamad and the public choice of the Khalifah family coincided* The clash of eqaally balanced claims was avoided, and Shaikh Salman, without opposition or dispute, ruled in his father's stead* I have the honour to be, Sir, Tour most obedient servant, Political Agent, Bahrain*Confidential. Ko .c/23 8 of 1942. Office of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Camp | Bahrain. Dated the 26th March, 1942. Prom - The Hon'ble Lieut.-Colonel W.R.Hay, C.I.S., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To - The Secretary to the Government of India, External Affairs Department New Delhi Sir, JPjli I have the honour to forward herewith a copy of a report I have received from the Political Agent, sahrain, on the death of His Highness Shailch Sir Hamad hin 'Isa al Khalifah, K.C.I.E.,C.S.I., Ruler of Bahrain, and the succession of his eldest son. His Highness Shaikh Salman bin T 'araad al Khalifan. 2. It is extremely satisfactory that Shailth Salman's succession took place so smoothly. Although Mr. .akefield was confronted with no particular difficulties I consider he handled the situation arising out of the death of Shaikh Hamad with tact and ability. The influence of Mr.Belgrave who has for so long guided the affairs of the Bahrain Government was also undoubtedly a stabilising factor. 3. The new Ruler of Bahrain is 47 years old. He is abstemious in his habits, though unlike his father he smokes, and conservative in his general behaviour - though by no means so old-fashioned as his father. He has the reputation of bein.g: somewhat close-fisted and is unlikely to continue Shaikh Hamad's excessive liberality towards the Bedouin, which is all to the good. He is already selling off and giving away many of the useless camels and ponies which his father received in exchange for motor cars and other costly gifts. He can read and write Arabic, is a student of geography and takes a keen interest in affairs. He has a ready flow of conversation and possesses intelligence and ability. Though he has for many years been associated with the affairs of the State as a meaber of his / father 's-2- father's Cabinet, and has latterly been President of the Court of Wards and Chairman of the Muharraq Municipality, he has remained somewhat in the baclcground. He has however slipped very easily into the position of Ruler, seems thoroughly to enjoy his new dignities and I consider it probable that he will take a much more active part in the direction of his Stated affairs than his father. He is said to be an admirer of Heza Shah and to have expressed an opinion that it is necessary at times to take strong measures to stimulate the progress of a backward country. It is I think probable that in due course he will be anxious to cerry out reforms in Bahrain, though it is to be hoped that he will not endeavour to imitate Reza Shah too closely. At present he is respected by all classes because of his impartiality and refusal to interfere in people's private affairs. It is dangerous to prophesy but on the whole I am inclined to think that Shaikh Salman should prove a better Ruler than his father though he will never inspire the same universal affection. It is possible that his anxiety to assert his authority may give rise to some difficulties to begin with. 4. I would call partial lar attention to the concluding paragraph of 'Jlr.Wakefield 1 s report. I agree that it was most useful to have on record all the discussions which took place on the subject of the succession, but in the event the secret testament of Shaikh Hamad had no influence on the course of events, and as Mr.Wakefield points out it might have proved a most serious embarrassment. I am inclined to thii k ; t at any secret declaration of this sort should be avoided in future. If a Ruler is strong enough to appoint a successor in his life time and to obtain his family's consent to the appoi. jtment, well and good - otherwise it is better, though no doubt less conven ient for us, to leave the question of succession to be settled by a fanily conclave after the Ruler's death, in acc -rdance / withwith the usual Arab custom. 5. Shaikh Salman is a 'good life 1 and it is to be hoped that it will be many years before it is necessary to consider the succession question again in detail. The position may however be briefly stated. He has three sons of whom the eldest is only ten years old. It seems unlikely that any of these will be fit to succeed as Ruler for at least fifteen years. He has two surviving uncles Shaikhs Muhammad and Abdulla, the latter of whom was considered as his most likely rival for the succes sion on the death of his father. Both these uncles are now of advanced age and I am inclined to think have more or less faded out of the picture. Should Shaikh Salman die before one of his sons has emerged as a leading personality I should expect the family to select one of his brothers as his successor. These are seven in number and I should expect the choice to fall on Duaij or Abdulla, probably the former. Duaij is the more popular and has succeeded the Shaikh as President of the Court of Wards. Abdulla is well educated and speaks English freely; he has taken Shaikh Salman^ place as Chairman of the Muharraq Municipality. A family tree is appended. $ 6.
