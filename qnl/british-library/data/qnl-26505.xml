VKING IBN iSS-SAUD'S ACTIVITIliS IN INDIA Pakistan and the Arab League London 21, ANA: - An article appeared in the Weekly Tribune today about the singular activities of King Ibn es-Saud among the Maharajas of India, and the paper found relation between these activities and the residence in New Delhi of the British Moslem St. John Philby who is well versed in Arab affairs. The (English) paper says that no sooner had the idea of establishing a Moslem State in India crystallized, than the Arab States began to show great interest in it; and this interest increased when it became evident that there would be more than one Moslem State in India. It goes without saying that the participation of the Islamic Indian States with the Arab League will raise its prestige. It is therefore no wonder that H.M. King Ibn es-3aud, in his capacity as Defender of the Two Shrines (in Mecca and Medina) is acting as a mediator and encouraging the/Islamic Indian States to 3°In the Arab League.1 COPY AL-HAYAX, June 24, 1947 ' INTKIGUS AGAINST THB AKA3 LclAGUS' 'Th^re* is no doubt that the Arab League has of late become a thorn in the side of those who do not wish to see it prosper. For this reason they have started to conspire against it, especially as it has become evident to them that the Arab League cannot be used as a tool to serve the interests of this nation or of that. Two days ago ANA sent a cable to the effect that there is a move to change the Arab League into an Islamic League of which Pakistan can be a member; and inspite of Azzam Pasha's denial, certain papers published the Ah A report under prominent headlines. The rumour of an Islamic League is of the same category as that of Greater Syria, and has as its sole object the undermining of pan-Arab co-operation by stirring up fear and anxiety among Arab Christians in general and Lebanese Christians in particular. Therefore we warn Arab public opinion not to be misled by such manoeuvres'. ,,( 3 ) 19, There are indications that th. ^ Ministry arc not seeing eye-to ey . t ^ie lack of co-operation rr^.ution on November 16th ;.xpres. ing g League was not consulted citered by the Ministry and deciaring that ri ^ for anything in matters of policy it would not hold itself pons ^ ported that untoward which might happen ia thettend a meetLg of the the Premier, Khan Abdul t r ^to^.‘d^ dlto. league-, provincial Muslim league at which it was proposeo « ^e differences with the Ministry, tepresentatives of ^ ^ promise fros recently visited labors and are December to Mr. Liaqat All Khan to go to Peshawar in the in .t wee study the situation on the spot.SECRET D.0.

In so doing you should however make it clear that as all the States members of the Arab League will be represented at the Conference the question of his right as Secretary, General of the League to speak on behalf of its component members will not of course arise. 2. Question of correspondence with the Arab League is being given urgent consideration. This question raises however various important considerations and it is not possible to take an immediate decision regarding it. Presence of Azzam at the Conference need hot however in any way prejudge this issue particularly since representatives of various Jewish organisations will be invited.

My despatch No. 155. 'Trud' of 19th March printed a two-and-e-half coluinn account of this lecture on the Arab League v/hich has a slight shift of emphasis from that given by our reporter. The lecture has apparently been revised for presentation in the press. 2. 'Trud''s account brings out more clearly the two contrary points of view on the League, which may be seen as representing either the true interests of the Arab peoples in their struggle for national independence and unity, or an attempt on the part of 'e certain foreign power to political weapon in the Middle East, and 'for this reason a bloc which threatans peace and security'. The report says that both views are one-sided, and that a struggle is going on inside the League. But the lecturer's prediction that 'progressive tendencies' would carry the day has been excised from the 'Trud' report. 3 ...k - 3 - French relations with the Levant States. This hostility to France in the Levant contrasts with tie silence maintained over events in Indo-China despite their similarity to Indonesia.

Your letter No.RB/37^ oX’ tlie luth June 1945 has come via Muscat and this accounts a good deal for the delay in replying. The paper is difficult to reply to for in fact it does not repre sent the title at all. it is not written from an Indian view point but from a British one. All Howes seems to have done is to collect un &amp; number of the Hid die Hast problems of today and male somewhat ranuon. observations on them under the heeding - Arab Federation as seen from India. • 2. 'Arab Xeneration’' is not, as Howes rightly says, a pan-Islamic movement, though you may not have heard that cei'tain sections of the Persian press in their searches lor iuug to throw at the British have accused us of successfully destroying the pan- Islamic origin of the movement, and ox’ leaving only the dry bones of Federation. That is a stupidity that one might e?pect from their so often scurrilous pens. 3. as regards the term ’’Federation, a great deal has already been written on the subject all pointing to the fact that real political federation was never intended. The most that the ’’Arab oeopies' hoped for was a commonwealth of Arabic-speaking people base' on the unifying factors of languag# ana culture. There was not, however, to be any capital to the commonwealth, and the movement in this respect car/ fairly be likened to a revival of the Caliphate without the Caliph. 4. The term 'Arab peoples” is vague end pretty well meaningless in this connection without explanation. Howes’ explanation in paragraph 4 that the 11 Arabs’’ mean a Federation of reasonable human beings using a common civilised language is, in my opinion, but using words for words’ sake, ano if the last sentence is taken into consideration he concludes that the Arabs mean a Federation of ’’men”. This seems mere verbiage to me. He also says that the words ’’Arab”, or ”the Arab people”, conjure up for us ”hawked-nosed sons of the; desert in snowy burnous or else the riff-raff of Port Said”. It would have been more instructive and accurate, if less picturesque, to have described the people of the Federation concern ing whom his paper is written as the Araoic-speaking people of the Middle hast. The illustrations savour of ”3eau Geste” films and the P.5; 0. passengers impression en route to India. ooth Howes’ illustrations are geograpnicaliy wrong, arad they are unfortunate for the idea benind them is of western ^radic-sneaking people, whereas the 'Federation” concerns primarily and essentially eastern Arabic-speaking peoples. The term ’’Federation” is out of date, and the appellation for the movement met m th today is ’’Arab League”. This term should be qualified in one’s mind as the Eastern Arab League, for the tens of millions of Arabic-speaking people from the Ludan to the Atlantic have no part in the movement. 5. This brings us to another point with regard to the hawk-nosed and riff-raff gentry, which is that while they are Moslem (or I should think the more popular term ’’Mohammeaans” would suit the original thought) and while in conception, the League - 3et us now call it - was predominantly Islamic; a Tne Sunni at that, in inspiration, a change has taken place 'recently. The Maronite community of Syria and the Lebanon nas cast in its lot with the league, presumably in the common anti-French cause and not because of any love of Islam. The incipient iaea was Eastern Arabic speak ing Arabs, as opposed to other religious sects, who were to unite, federate, league together or whatever it may be on the common grounds of language and culture. Alreauy this has broadened into the inclusion of Christian elements, and it would indeed be a full turn of the wheel if the League and its opposition to the West were eventually to obtain the cooperation of Palestinian Jewry. 6 6. A parallel which might have been drawn is the rather obvious, from the Indian point of view, one of Pakistan, and a nimble wit might even invent a similar term in which to cloak this Arab aspira tion to pseudo-nationality with its endeavour at eliminating racial,* social and even religious differences across the existing frontiers 7* A further point on which I differ strongly with Howes is his estimation of the Americans. I refer to his paragraph 26 where he dubs theoi pretty v/ell as misfits. They would be if tney were altruistic enough, as Howes suggests they are, to leave to the British the leading of an jlrnb Federated ' t‘- 1e because^ of the sufficiency of their o.vn dominant position on the Arabian Peninsula. That latter is another debatable point, but it was not that which I wish lo point out but the inaccuracy oT his estimation of the Americans. They have dome most able men and brilliant linguists, men and women, diplomats, doctors and both secular and religious teachers, and I snould say ticn in relation we have. to in a iorican responsibilities liuch higher pr o p or - atbi commitments than 8. Howes has overlooked the fact that the American University at Beyrouth has been in existence for many years, how many I regret to say I don't know. This institution is of inestimable value for the diffusion of American thought and of equal value as a training centre for personnel, uands, the American Vice-Consul at Dhnhren who has interested nimself so much in Bahrain, nut now toon sent there for training. This is remini scent of Aass muns and the special training he was given oy the Germans; and .\ith what success that system was f oil owed we well nnow. xne American minister at Jedda was trained at Beyrouth, and is one of the few westerners who can converse freely with Bin gaud, ^ramco have at ciiO expert on Arab tribes and the language, anu this mar) h*s trained men under him. Also the Arabian Ajissions with their mealed and scholastic establishments dotted about the countries of the League and elsewhere in the Middle Last should be remembered. In the very heart of Cairo the Americans hav e a 1urge Mi s sion C tnIre. 9. fce have nothing, to compare with these facilities for training, absorption ana dissemination of Arab thought and ideas, not excluding the Arab Centre in Jerusalem. That is only in its infancy, and sets out to give rapid training to young officers, and does not attempt the education of arab youth as does the American University at Beyrouth. 10. I see that ’Howes in the final paragraph brings in the old chestnut of a coriination of various services, end says that it is 'quite obvious” that u cadre of specially trained officers must be founded without delay, lersonally I don’t think it is so obvious, particularly as he claims to b** writing from an Indian angle. From Muscat to Casablanca and the Mediterranean to the Equator almost would be about the territory of r,ho cadre and what \direct connection with the greater area of that territory has India, and why should officials for all that territory be caste from the same mould ? Indeed, for India’s commitments In countries connected with the Arab League, India has, I think, a not inefficient body of officials, and I am not at all prepared to admit that they, or India, would be any the better off for their being sent to sit at the feet of lecturers Tor years. I would agree to special training, which would include dialectal language training, for a selected few who have shown a bent in certain directions, as for his recommendation to absorb the various services, Sir Header Bullard’s remark to me the other day was apt. He said that the formation of the Foreign Service had 'created a Service without experts”, incidentally he added that events may soon turn us into ,f a body of experts without a Service”. That was a nice compliment. 11 11. I am afraid that I have found myself at difference with Howes through many passages of his paper and the more I read it the more this appears. He says in paragraph 17 that 'the only possible way to discharge our pledge to the Arabs would be to call a council etc.” Lurelywe have made no pledge to the Arabs in this war, and have we officially pledged ourselves to promote Arab unity (vide paragraph 13) ? V.hat the Eden Declaration says is that we promise to support any scheme that commands general approval and that is a pretty broad statement. I don’t think we have, or ever shall, take any action to promote Federation. It is difficultto f.ee how we can for by supporting a b]oc, say, in Tre^., oyria, cind the Lebanon we should be antagonising, s&amp;y, Saudi Arabia and Transjordan. We are unlikely to ccire into the open with a policy of opposition which, besides being impolitic, might but stimulate the movement. Lo we let it go ahead, well aware of the strong rivalries among the various states. 12. Howes seems to me to be quite confused on. the main issue which is to what extent political federation is actually desired by the countries of the ireb League. You will find that in paragraph 2/&lt; there ic to be a TT *'td ea n bloc of Lgypt ar.o the Sudan, Ter .•on a nd r.audi Arabia, and in paragraph 22 there is to be a new stste of the old Levant states ^’hinh with Iraq is to form a 'firm base to out-flank Lucs la’’ and ?t the same time 'to counter balance Fgypt in the Arab world'. r “hon everybody is to do some cnees-up” until there is one happy union. 13. 1 don’t think Howes gets on any better in paragraph 17 where he says that v. r e should have to settle up our affairs in Palestine with a 'wetk Arab Federation”, whatever that might be. There is no reason that I can why we ‘should settle with any Federation.

That was innocuous, but he added that plans were afoot to put American air lines and radio-telegraphic comjiiunications into overy Middle East country. So much for a card of entry (paragraph 26 of Howes’ paper); it looks more like playing out of the wrong hand to me. 3. With reference to paragraph 4 of my letter, from the 'Times” of the 5th June I see that the League Council went into secret session and that it was learnt (not so secret!) that the Council had decided to raise the question of the independence of other Arabs, notably those of the French north African colonies.

Bagdad No. 9. ) Beirut No. 18. ) yyyyyyyy Old rivalries between Arab States have become accentuated during discussions leading up to constitution of Arab League, and in these rivalries Egypt has entered as a new element. The rivalry between Egypt and Iraq for the leading rdle in the Arab Union became evident from the beginning of the discussions. The Hashemites and Nuri so intimately associated with the Arab Movement from its early stages, were not unnaturally piqued at being ousted by a newcomer from the major rdle. By a naturaly process Ibn Suud aligned himself with Egypt against his old enemies, the Hashemites and Nuri. The Lebanon, which was fearful of domination by a still uneuropeanised Muslim hinterland, naturally followed suit, regarding Egypt as more modernised and less fanatical than Cyria and Iraq. Memories of Ibrahim Pasha were even evoked to promote closer relations between the Lebanon and Egypt. Syria, which at the beginning was not enthusiastic ally pro-Egyptian, has gradually evolved towards Egypt owing to the desire of the present governing elements in Syria to preserve the republican regime and their apprehensions of Hashemite designs on Syria. King Farouk has always treated the Emir Abdullah very superciliously and there is no love lost between them. More over inevitably a Hashemite Emir, with liis dreams of a Syrian throne, would find himself in the opposite camp to that of the present Syrian rulers. It wras equally inevitable that, in spite of rivalries between Abdullah and the Iraqi Royal family over §,yfia, the two Hashemite powers should find themselves standing together against the Egyptian bloc. 2. The latest phase of these developments has been the movement towards the conclusion of treaties between Egypt and Saudi Arabia, with the suggested adherence of Syria, and between Egypt and the Lebanon. The Hashemites are thus tending to be isolated.in the Arab League. - - 3. The movement towards Arab Union, encouraged by our declaration of sympathy towards any attempt of the Arabs to get together, started with the genuine desire to attenuate the balkan- isation of .Arab lands Drought about mainly by the necessities of Anglo-French politics and with the’equally genuine desire to protect Arab lands from outside encroachment.- rs= ENCLOSURE ii5 AlR kiff&amp;R No. 42 2 &gt;'&lt; 0 UT .la^o SECReHrV, EXTERNAt fctW* , miA SECRETARY, EXTERf /4. Egyptwhich of 4. Egypt took the lead, actuated at the beginning largely hy reasons- of internal politics. Nahas Pasha wished t 0 strengthen his internal prestige by posing as a leader ol tne Arab world, and King Parouk wishes to strengthen hls , by assuming a similar role. King Ibn 3aud was from the Deginnifc opposed to the idea of Arab Union because he feareu mean a Hashemite domination of the Fertile Crescent with the consequent danger to his own position in the Hejaz. Hence his determination to saooter any northern combination. -The Lebanoi was determined to preserve its complete independence in oi’ aer to avoid absorption in a Muslim Bloc. The attitudes of uhe Lebanon and Ibn Saud -led to the emasculation of the corporate idea of the League and that of the Lebanon to the attenuation of any executive function of the League,- such as that involved in compulsory arbitration. Ibn Saud and the -Lebanon were kept within the League largely by the influence of E^ypt-, whose support in the Council they regarded as a guarantee* against the dangers they saw- in it to their respective countries. Syria, alter aiming at the creation of a Greater Syria under the rule ol Damascus, acquiesced in the maintenance 01 the present aivisions of the western part of the Fertile Crescent. -his acquiescence was due to the fear that prosecution of the idea a Greater Syria would drive the Lebanon back into Irench arms. Syrian acquiescence was no doubt also partly due to the influence of Egypt, whose assistance it needed for its emancipation from France and for support against Hashemite designs. * 5. It is clear from all this that the influence of ^vot is a determining factor in the present evolution oi^ Arab States. It is also clear that the Hashemites are being relegated to the background, largely owing to Egyptian mani pulation of their rivals. This is not a haopy state ol el*airs. Vie are under obligations to the Hashemites for the role tu.ey placed in the last war and lor -their stabilising inlluence m Transjordan and Iraq. As things are at present in the Arab worxd, it'is not in our interest that,Hashemite prestige should be weakened in those two countries. I submit therefore, that our efforts should be directed against the isolation of the T Uashemites within the Arab League. If we make representations to ibn Saud against exclusive treaty making, we^should make similar representations to King Farouk and the Egyptian ^ Government'. We can justify these representations by our desire to promote union among our Egypto-Arab friends and to remove the aanger that the present discords may wreck the League. 6 A v *ab Union has now been realised m paper oy the f o-tt tion of an Egypto-Arab Bloc ol independent units preserving tPi'- of ten coni lifting policies of the ore-League period. There will no doubt be much friction between the members of the League ana without our good offices these frictions are likely to end m a relaxation, if not disintegration of the League. It may noaoubt be argued by some, on the principle of divide and rule, that such disintegration would not be contrary to our interests, swhile^on a'short term view this is an arguable proposition, I reel that vou will agree that on a long term view it fs to our advantage - that the Egypto'-Arab world should not be distracted by internecine conflicts which will expose it not only to British but also to Russian penetration. Moreover, the balkanisation of the Arab woiId leads to material retrogression which militates to provoke ais content in a large area lying across our lines of communications and containing our vital oil supplies. I suggest, therefore, tha w have a long term interest in promoting through Arab cooperation the material welfare and the satisfaction of the sentimental aspirations of these countries as far as our imperial interests permit. ^hese /aspirations5 * aspirations, though often obscured described, nevertheless constitute relations of these countries with in the stability of the whole Middl 4 r vpltiQ su a permanent fac Great Britain ar ]e '••• ! f945 ch as I have tor in the d moreover 7. At present it may be said that the only aims on ^aich all these States are united are those of getting rid of the French from Syria and of preventing the Zionist domination of Palestine. V/hatever discords may weaken the Arab League in the immediate future, we must count on its oeing united on these two issues.: &amp; personal. External Affairs Department, NEV, DELHI.

Cleary, Esq., India Office, Whitehall London, S.A.1. C V ■ . tv ./ K7 0 o ^OP 3SCPIT AND PERSON^. ARAB FEDERATION AS SEEN FROM INDIA, It should not be thought that this is intended to be a paper pn the current situation in the Levant. It is quite impossible to write effectively on such a subiect at this range, and'in the absence of information about H.M.Grs policy towards France and the French colonial empire, of which even the Government of India de not seem yet to have been apprised. It is, in fact, impossible t^ attempt any sort of topicality* w^ 10 ^- 6 issue of world security, regional pacts, etc,, isin the melting pot at San Francisco: the 'Alexandria Protocol' signed last November by the Arab States has been reviewed at a further » council held towards the end of last February, but still no report of the conclusions of that council have been released, nor is even the ratification of its conclusions - whatever they may have been - certain: while a burning issue is now being fought out, involving the whole principle of the position of Western Powers in the Middle East. It may, however, be of some value to attempt an assessment of # tendencies in the Middle East as seen from India. Leaving aside the bonds of unity felt by Indian Muslims for the peoples of Middle Eastern countries^ there is an intense interest in india as a whole in the political changes now taking place there, which serve as a prototype of India's own problems in more ways than-one. The question of the relations of Asiatic peoples with a paramount European power will be a touchstone in Indian eyes, or British honesty and goodwill. Similar problems of harmonizing ppposing interests, and protecting the rights of minorities without unduly weakening the central power, are raised both by Arab Federation and by the Indian constitutional problem. Finally, it must not be forgotten that the Middle East is at once the vital strategic zone for India’s defence against aggression from Europe, her link of communication with every part of the world except Australia and the Far East, and the area of her most natural economic expansion. 2, It is not intended to draw a history of movements towards Arab Federation (or more strictly, Arab independence from the Turkish empire) during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, from the insurgence or Mohamed Ali, through the days of under ground revolutionary societies in Syria, to the final victory of Feisal. Arab Federation, as we now understand it. is quite a different thing from Arab Independence, although the solution of the problems of mandated areas bulks large in its objectives. ,3. # must, we think of Arab Federation in pan-Islamic terms. The idea.of pan-Arabism was developed as an offset to the pan- Turanianism of Abdul Hamid, at a time when Turkey was still officially a Muslim State. Moreover, the proposed Federation clearly excludes certain important Muslim area, Persia to the •i«ast and Morocco to the West. 4. We ourselves know very well what picture is coniured up in our minds by the word Arab, the hawk-nosed son of the desert, in snowy burnous etc. etc., or else the riff-raff of Port Said. But n, Arab' is indeed a proud name on the lips of an Arab, and means exactly what the Greeks implied themselves to be when they referred to all non-Hellenic races as 'barbaroi' - people who can only talk in unintelligible syllables like 'bar - bar'. The word Arab' is composed of three letters, ’a, r and b; and this simple- 2 - root has many compound derivations. Take a few:- : Aruba - to be an Arab, or to speak (distinctly) f Arraba = to Arabicize pr to speak on behalf of someone A’raba to express oneself (clearly). So, whatever i.e may think that Arab Federation means, it clearly means to the Arabs themselves a Federation of reasonable human beings, who are able to make themselves understpod in a civilized language. In fact, the word jt Arab is often used without much more connotation thaii '’men' . 5. This seems to throw a good deal of lighi' on the suggestions which are sometimes made for ”guiding Arab Federation into • . . » 'i n a T -■ X X 1 ~ ^ Via H A • nil T. 1 1 innocuous channels”. A little can perhaps be done; but it will by full adult diplomacy. The day.of mandates is ’ J tutelage will be unacceptable have to be ending, and anything savouring of tu to a Federation of the clear-speaki ng men 6. Tfe may perhaps first see what obiectives the Arabs have set themselves in ':heir move to Federation. For this, it is necessary to read the Alexandria Protocol, and it is accordingly reproduced as an appendix to this paper. It will be seen that its avowed objectives are innocuous in the extreme, and consist merely of cultural, social and economic cO“Operation t and the execution of the Arab League’s decision on States which agree to accept them. The question remains whether, and if so when, this is likely to develop into a full political federation. 7. The Protocol certainly foreshadows the possible use of coercion against recalcitrant members. The Council of the League of Arab States, when formed, will ”execute agreement^' independently arrived at by member States. Its decisions will only be binding on those who accept them, unless the point has been referred tor arbitration, in which case the decisions W will have t o b e. carried_put”. No State ” a foreign policy prejudicial lo the League. 8. Now it is clear that the three points contained in the quoted passages do imply a possible use of sanctions by the^ League against recalcitrant members, although at the same time 'it is forbidden to have recourse to force to settle % conflicts between two States of the League”. It is hard to imagine what economic or other sanctions could be imposed, e.g. by Saudi Arabia on Iraq, or by Egypt on Transjordan, that would have much effect. 9. Azzan Bey has tacitly recognized this defect in a pronouncement m which he said that M public # opinion is 89 firmly behind us that within a very snort time the Council will nave the same authority and prestige as the American Supreme Court, and no member State will feel itself strong enough to disregard the Council’s decisions”. The same ideal might, however, be said to have been the swan song of the Leagu© °f Nations, while at San Francisco the world is evidently building rn a more realistic appreciation of human nature. fc r~/&gt; - 3 - 10. It must protably be recognized that ^® p ^ c ?® s | h ° r ear i y failure of the Arabs' attempts to federate depend in dl ^ stages on the goodwill of the Western powers.Itis haraiy possible to fail to remark that up t? date ™ere tea eeen^a^ complete absence of constructive 5£ tl f’ovnnt t Hisou?e - apart from the Alexandria Protocol to solve the Levant dispute aparu a vague offer by Egypt to mediate. forget that history is merely repeating itself, ior ^00^ was bombarded after the last war. as mus ._xl.py. 4-uq French issue in Syria is.not merely a question of whether the^frencn qtav or cet out, it is a question of whether they go wiwi a trtat? of without one.

Unquestionable economic and strategic intepesta demand that Great Britain maintain her position in the Middle East, but this is no longer to be secured oy the old means of mandates, subsidies^ adders, and so forth! We have officially pledged ourselves to promote Arab unity, and it would be a fatal blow to our credit in Arab eyes if we were ever to go back on the w Eden Declaration”. . The salient passage of this runs.- H The Arab world has made great strides since the settlement (sic) reached at the end of the last war, and many Arab thinkers desire xor uhe Arab peoples a creator degree of unity than they now enjoy. In reaching out towards this unity they.hope for our support? No such appeal from pur friends should go unanswered, ft seems to me both natural and ^iSh that the economic ties between Arab countries,and th political ties too. should be strengthened. . N.M.lr. for their part will give their full support to any scheme that coimands general approval.7 - 4 •• 14, Apart from this,.we have long-soanding ties with the^ Arab States, and a prcblem on our own nands x. fa^estine. +.hArpf , nrfi nil' out'of the Question for us bo give lire cl therefore quite out of tiie question for us oo ^ v support to the French in.Syria either by force or diplomacy.

He would not exactly welcome a union of Syria Palestine^ the Hashimites: but such a union would not be nprtninlv * actual Hashimiie rule in those two countries, ^ the must not forget that the father of ohe Regent^Abd pwi r King Ali whom Ibn Sand evicted from theHeiaz^andtheEmir Abdullah still emits an occasional snarl at the Saudi King. But Ibn Baud has little to^fear from them mlitari y economically with Great Britain and the U.S.A., as a P &gt; vying to support him, and witn vast wealth lying und ^ surface of his country e He has not latterly seemed to take veryseriously the possibility of one of his sons succeeding to the^Syrian throne and has probably more or less dropped the idea. on a consolidation of the Mediterranean Arab countries, vi£. the old Ottomn vilayets of Syria, Aleppo and Beirut would Have certain definite advantages. The Jewish ^d Maromte problems would fall more into perspective;.Palestinian fT^bs would welcome the accession of support from their fellow Muslims of Syria ad Transioraan: while uhe position of the Jews and Lebanese could be 1 safeguarded by some measure of local autonomy within the new State, Is was enjoyed by the sanjaq of Lebanon under the Turks. The Druzes might possibly receive some similar treatment. .The onat of overnment would obviously be considerably reduced, while thf neV^tateToGld have little to fear from a confderation with Iraq, with which she would be sufficiently equal a partner. 21. If this can be achieved by.joint Anglo-French action now to terminate the mandates, there is n ° re ® son .^y ba y strategic treaty should not concurrently be signed.by the Arabs with both the ex-mandatory powers. In any case, with the range of modern weapons, it is.no longer sufficient to hole Palestine *n nvrl pv 1*n ^pcurc tii6 air^routG and th.0 Sugz Canal, oiiir strltegczonemistexolnd to the Turkish and Persian frontiers. 22. The suggestion therefore is that our promised support of Arab Federation should be in three stages:- Stage, Unite up the Mediterranean Arab countries; keen France in the ring; terminate the mandates and get our strategic requirements bv treaty.- 6 - Stage II *’ Encourage the new State to federate (or # confederate) with Iraq; if necessary, assist matters by revising our treaty with Iraq in the form of a strategic treaty with the whole bloc; thus create a firm base to out'-flank Russian advance to the Persian Gulf, and at *• ‘ «the same time create a strong counter-balance • /to Egypt in the Arab world. Then mark time indefinitely for Stage III, viz , the full Arab Federation. i 23. Egypt obviously wants Stage III to come first. With the other Arab countries weak and disunited, she can rule the^roost, commanding their support for her demands for treaty revision, the evacuation of troops from the Canal Zone, etc.; and later on (though not so long hence) in stiffening her terms when the renewal of the Suez Canal concession comes up. Air routes also give her a strong card, for although the post-war passenger plane may be able to fetch Bahrain non-stop from the Mediterranean it will hardly be possible to avoid the use of Egypt as the junction for the Far East and the South African lines. 24. Egypt has lately seemed to be at considerable pains to consult ion Saud. No doubt this partly due to his personal prestige; but with the extension of Ibn Saud’s influence over the Imam of Yemen, and of Egypt's interest in the Sudan, one cannot help wondering whether they are thinking in terms of a kind of 'Red Sea' bloc within the main Federation, If so, it still more behoves the northern Arab countries to make a conmon front. 25. Clearly, in dealing with the problem Great Britain and France will have to keep in consultation with America, Admittedly, American interests in Arab countries lie rather in the Arabian peninsula than in the 'fertile crescent' countries. In Saudi Arabia they have their oilfields and their gold mines; they have insisted on a joint Anglo-American military mission instead of the British Muslim mission which it was at one time planned to send; they aim at establishing airfields across the Arabian peninsula; they have put in an American Consul at Dhehran opposite Bahrain, and plan to develop the port of Ras Tanura, in order to break the stranglehold imposed on Bin Saud's eastern coast by the string of Naboth's vineyards which we maintain there; they have offered to make up to Ibn iaud whatever sum Great Britain reduces from the subsidy granted as compensation for the loss of pilgrim traffic revenue; and so on. 26. America has only one card of entry into the northern Arab area in the form of her support of Zionism; but it is a high card, since that policy is imposed on the u.S. Government by verybig # business interests. The writer has little doubt that Zionism in the U.S.A. is closely linked with the Ickes project for a pipeline from the Hasa oil-fields to the Mediterranean. Moreover, it can hardly be doubted that one of the main motives behind the Balfour Declaration was to secure the support of American Jewry from the U.S.A.'s entry into the last war. and America’s interest in the matter has recently been unmistakeably affirmed. We may, therefore, even if it is agreed that the French and ourselves should settle the political structure of the 'fertile crescent', have to give certain preliminary guarantees to America. Direct and active American co-operation m settling the problems of the mandated areas is hardly a prospect that can be welcomed. America has neither the tradition nor the responsibilities in the Middle East which Britain has r\? I - 7 - had for centuries? and Americans do not fit these countries either by capacity to learn the languages Sdlo to understand the'people - or by knowledge of how_to behave towards Middle Eastern peoples. f° _ operation with us (sc. rather than our ^°t' 1 ^ 1 y rnean 3 a n accept- subiect to American concurrence) would not only mean an anceof the position of junior partner in an area where we have been head of the firm for hundreds of years,.but would also involve us in the slightly contemptuous ^^(iia^is Eastern peoples have for our presumed collaborators Uhat^is, for them personally, as ppposed to the n rjemnsula their money). Their dominant pos!tip h ° ''r aa . on i s ^ g 0 f the ought to rinke them content to let us be the protagonists United Nations in the ’’fertile crescent • 27. As a tailpiece to a paper on Arab Federation, one should perhaps cast a brief glance at the other countries of t Middle East, which Arab Federation r(3 ga conmented interesting to note that a section of the Pe J s ^n press conmentea on the Arab Federatipn mpve as an artifice of 0 f the strengthen her position in the Middle East. The collapse oie Saadabad nact has left Persia and Afghanistan high ana if the British Conmonwealth does not maintain its influence in these two countries, Russian influence will hold the field. It has been contended in another paperthat the natural member of the British Conmpnwealth to Ml this ga^ is India, which has not only ancient historical connections wion both.^t has also a cadre.of officers trained and equipped to HnnHlfl dinlomatic affairs m these countries. n.M.u. s diplomatic^ and consular posts in Afghanistan are already mnned from the Indian service, while India.also i llls , a numDer of Consulates in Persia. The retention r n Ji a i. strengthening of this organization fits.in well s Gulf special interest and representative ^ h f n 5f”^to a The desirability was ou - ^ould not position of direct contact with Russia, in which she could not fail to see the necessity, for her own safety, of staying m the Comnonwealth. 28 Finallv. it seems quite obvious that a cadre of officers with special training, particularly in the Arabic language should bo formed without delay; and perhaps the Middle East Ministry of State continued after the war. Steps have been taken to train certain junior army officers in Arabism ; but the ultimate objective of this training and the method of manning senior posts do not seem to be clearlvdefined.. Such an 'Arab cadre' might conveniently absorb the Sudan service, and also take over . Consul arposts in Turkey, North Africa and perhaps Abyssinia and Somaliland, as well as the obvious Arab countries of the proposed Federation. PIM.The A lexandrla._Prot.oaol.. Part 1.

REUTER.(A* D. I Ion teat h spoke to me on Saturday about the vlesarability of* seeing that the Government ox Inoia v/ere kept in touch with developments,, such as the Levant crisis, which affect India as a partly Ifoslem country but which are only on the fringe of her direct range of interests. The present practice is that the Government of India have related to them all ^the important telegrams about Persia, but ohat so far as^rabia, Iraq and other Moslem countries further afield are, concerned, they only get a few of tiie telegrams mainly in the form of copies through the India Office from the somewhat limited selection cu those which we receive ourselves. The Government of India do, however, get most of the foreign Office Prints about Middle East and \rab affairs, though tnese are only available to them after some lapse of time. ^ V, r e recently asked the Foreign Office to circularise their Middle East posts reminding them ox the desirability of letting the Government of India and the Political Resident have copies of important papers on Middle East and Arab matters direct, and Foreign Office did this, (see their letter of 1st May, flagged). Apart from the above arrangements the Viceroy himself gets copies of the irportant telegrams on xoreign affairs which are sent to the Dominions Prime Ministers, and these he is at liberby to show to Sir 0. Caroe. I now understand (though I was-» - * * . v not aware of it when I spoke to Sir D. Monteatli on Saturday) that the practice of repeating to the Viceroy telegrams in the M Intel' series (circular information telegrams to Foreign Office Missions abroad] has now been resumed, so that he and Sir 0. Caroe are kept in touch by telegram with the main developments in foreign affairs. These, however, are often only very sketchy and I think there would be no harm in asking the Foreign Office to let us see more of their telegrams of Middle East affairs generally so that we may be in a position to pick out for the Government of India anything that is likely to be of particular interest to them.

Every independent Arab State has the right to join the League. It desirous of joining, it will present an application to that effect and deposit it at the Permanent Secretariat-General for submission to the Council at the first meeting to be held after presentation of the application. A Hide 2.—The object of the League is to strengthen relations between member States, to co-ordinate their political action with a view to ensuring collaboration between them and protection of their independence and sovereignty, and generally to consider all questions concerning the Arab countries and their interests. Likewise its aim is to ensure close co-operation between the member States consistent with the regime of each State and the conditions prevailing therein, in the following matters : {a) Economic and financial matters, including commercial relations, customs, currency, agriculture and industry. (6) Matters of communications, including railways, roads, aviation, shipping, posts and telegraphs. (c) Cultural matters. {d) Matters relating to nationality, passports, visas, execution of legal judgments and extradition of criminals. [e) Social matters. (/) Health matters. A rticle 3.—The League shall have a council composed of the representatives of the member States of the League, each State having only one vote irrespective of the number of its representatives. Its task will be to realise the aims of the League and to attend to the execution of agreements made between the member States on matters referred to in the preceding article and others. p) Note. —The King of the Yemen being unable to send delegates to Cairo, the text of the Covenant is being sent to him at Sana’a to be signed by his plenipotentiaries.3 The duties of the Council will also include those of determining the means of collaborating with international organisations which may be created in tne future to maintain order and peace, and of organising economic and socia relations. _ . , Article 4.—For each of the questions enumerated in Article 2, a special commission will be formed on which tihe member States of the League will be represented. These commissions will be entrusted with the task of laying down the basis and extent of collaboration and of putting them into the form of dratt agreements to be examined by the Council before being submitted to the btates concerned. . The commissions may include representatives of other Arab countries. 1 he Council will define the circumstances in which such representatives can be admitted and the bases of their representation. A rticle 5.—It is not permissible to resort to force in order to settle disputes between two or more States of the League. In case of a dispute which does not affect the independence, sovereignty, or territorial integrity of the State and if tihe litigant parties apply to the Council for the settlement of the dispute, the decisions of the Council shall be considered as effective and binding. In such a case the States involved in the dispute will take no part in the deliberations and decisions of the Council. The Council will also mediate in any dispute which it is feared might lead to war between one of the States of the League and any other State of the League or third State in order to effect a conciliation. Decisions on arbitration and in cases of mediation will be taken by a majority vote. Article 6.—In case of an aggression by a State against a member State of the League or in case of threat of such an aggression, the State attacked or threatened with attack may apply for an immediate meeting of the Council. The Council will decide on the necessary measures to prevent the aggression. Its decision will be unanimous. In case of aggression by a member State of the League the vote of that State will not be taken into account when reckoning unanimity. Should the aggression take place in a manner which renders the Government of the State against which the aggression is committed unable to com municate with the Council, the representative of the said State may apply for a meeting for the purpose set out in the preceding paragraph. Should the repre sentatives also be unable to communicate with the Council, then any member State may apply for its convocation. Article 7.—Decisions taken unanimously by the Council are binding on all member States of the League while decisions taken by a majority are only binding on those that accept them. In both cases the decisions of the Council will be executed by each State in accordance with its organic regime. Article 8.—Each member State will respect the regimes established in the other States of the League and will consider those regimes as a right of each State. It undertakes to abstain from any action tending to change that regime. Article 9.—The Arab States of the League wdio may wish to establish between them closer and stronger ties than those laid down in this Covenant may conclude between themselves such agreements as they may desire to realise these objectives. Treaties and agreements already concluded or which may be concluded in future by a Government or Governments of the League with any other Govern ment whatsoever do not (and will not) bind and do not (and will not) commit the other members. Article 10.—The permanent seat of the League of Arab States will be in Cairo, but the Council may meet at any other place as may be appointed. Article 11.—The Council of the League will meet in ordinary session twice a year during the months of March and October. It will meet in extraordinary session whenever the necessity arises at the request of two States of the League. Article 12.—The League will have a permanent Secretariat-General com prising a Secretary-General and Assistant Secretaries and an adequate number of officials. The Secretary-General will be appointed by the Council of the League by a two-thirds majority of the States of the League. The Secretary-General will appoint, with the approval of the Council, the Assistant Secretaries and senior officials of the League. The Council of the League will lay down internal regulations covering the duties of the Secretariat-General and staff matters. The Secretary-General will hold the rank of Ambassador and the Assistant Secretaries the rank of Ministers Plenipotentiary. [65—83] • b 24 The first Secretary-General will be designated in an annex to the present Covenant. , . . . Article 13—The Secretary-General will prepare the League s budget and will submit it to the Council for approval before the beginning of each financial year. The Council will determine the share of each State of the League in the expenses, which may be reconsidered when necessary. A rticle 14.—The members of the Council of the League as well as members of its commissions and its officials as laid down in the internal regulations will enjoy diplomatic privileges and immunities. The premises occupied by the organisations of the League will be inviolate. Article 15.—The Council will meet for the first time when summoned by the Egyptian Prime Minister and thereafter when summoned by the Secretary- General. The representatives of the States of the League will assume the presidency of the League in turn at each ordinary session. Article 16.—Except in the cases mentioned in the Covenant, a majority vote will suffice to constitute a binding decision by the Council in the following matters: {a) Questions concerning the staff; (5) Adoption of the budget of the League; (c) Adoption of regulations governing the Council, Committees and Secre tariat-General ; (d) The closing of sessions. A rticle 17.—The member States of the League will provide the Secretariat- General with copies of all treaties and agreements concluded or to be concluded with any member State or third State. Article 18.—If one of the States of the League desires to withdraw from it, the Council is to be informed of its intention one year in advance. The Council of the League may consider any State that does not comply with the obligations of the Covenant as excluded from the League by a decision given unanimously, excluding the vote of the State in question. Article 19.—This Covenant may be amended by a two-thirds majority vote of thp. States of the League, especially with a view 'to strengthening their ties, to creating an Arab Court of Justice or regulating the relations of the League with international organisations that may be formed in the future to guarantee order and peace. ^ No amendment will finally be adopted until the session following that in which it was first raised. Any State not accepting the amendment may withdraw at the time of its entry into force without being bound by the provisions of the preceding article. Article 20.—This Covenant and its annexes will be ratified according to the constitutional provisions of the various high contracting States. The instruments of ratification will be deposited at the Secretariat-General and the Covenant will become binding on those States that have ratified it, after the expiration of fifteen days from the date of receipt by the Secretary-General of the instruments of ratification from four States. This Covenant has been drawn up in Arabic in Cairo on 8 Rabia el Tani, 1364 (22nd March, 1945), in single copy to be deposited at the Secretariat-General. A true copy will be delivered to each State of the League. 1 i i Annexes. I .—Special Annex on Palestine. At the termination of the last Great War, the Arab countries were detached from the Ottoman Empire. These included Palestine, a vilayet of that Empire, which became autonomous, depending on no other Power. The Treaty of Lausanne proclaimed that the question of Palestine was the concern of the interested parties and, although she was not in a position to direct her own affairs, the Covenant of the League of Nations of 1919 settled her regime on the5 basis of the acknowledgment of her independence. Her international existence and independence are therefore a matter of no doubt from the legal point of view, just as there is no doubt about the independence of the other Arab countries. Although the external aspects of that independence are not apparent owing to force of circumstances, this should not stand in the way of her participation in the work of the Council of the League. The States that have signed the Covenant of the Arab League consider there- ftre that, owing to the peculiar circumstances of Palestine and until that country enjoys effective independence, the Council of the League should undertake the selection of an Arab delegate from Palestine to participate in its work. II. —Special Annex relating to Co-operation with Arab Countries not participating in the Council of the League. Considering that the States participating in the League will have to deal, both in the Council and in the commissions, with questions benefiting and affecting the whole Arab world, and in view of the aspirations of the Arab countries that are not members of the Council, it being for the Council to take them into account and work for their achievement, the States that have signed the Covenant of the Arab League invite the Council of the League, when considering the participation of those countries in the commissions referred to in this Covenant, to act in co-operation with those countries to the greatest possible extent, also to spare no effort to be acquainted with their requirements, to understand their aspirations and hopes and in addition to work for their welfare and for the assuring of their future by all means which political methods provide. III.— Special Annex on the Appointment of the Secretary-General of the League. The signatory States of this Covenant have agreed on the appointment of Abdel Rahman Azzam Bey as Secretary-General to the League of Arab States. His appointment will be for two years and the Council of the League will define subsequently the future organisation of the Secretariat-General.£ With th • CarrpfFrWeni Ur *nts c* Ha ‘ fry ofState • jun 1945 ' SECnET ^\jdjUC( ClO ** Z^r A ° ^ VW|\| 1J^3 WAr-O I 5 -T n J v [Thds telegram is of particular secrecy and should he ^ retained by the authorised recipient and not passed onj [En clair &amp; Cypher] WAR CABINET DISTRIBUTION FROM CAIR O T O FOREIGN OFFICE Lord KiHearn, D. 1*46 p.iru 27th March, 1945, No,750 R. 3c 35 p c m 3 27th iiarch, 1945, 26th March, 1945.

First part of the resolution is more unhappily worded than the text contained in annexe to draft of the Covenant (see my despatch No. 378 March 9th) particularly the suggestion that Palestine has become autonomous after the last war, no longer dependent on any other state. This however is an attitude which lias been steadily taken up by not only the Palestine Arab but by Arabs of other states who have refused to recognise the mandate. 3.

Bagdad Jedda Beirut Jerusalem Tehran Angora Govt, of India Washington Paris Moscow (all Saving; Despatched M Your telegram No.80 Saving /of March 23rd: formation of Arab League_/ contained an illuminating analysis of the forces at work in the Arab League. We must evidently take into account the possibility of the latent rivalries and discords between the member States increasing to such an extent as to lead to the collapse ot the League and the disintegration of the whole Arab unity movement • 2. I agree entirely with your view tnnt it is in our long-term interests that the Arab world should not be divided by inter necine conflicts. H.M. Government would have little to gain from the Balkanisation of the area, with rival Arab groups appealing for the help of outside Powers against each other. Our interests require a state of political stability in the whole area, such as will enable us to maintain and strengthen the friendly relations which we have been able to establish with each one of the Arab States. 3. There has long been much sympathy in this country for the aspirations of the Arabs to reduce the barriers set up between them as the result of the last war, and the Arab unity movement has been encouraged and helped by various public pronouncements made by H.M.G. during the past few years. The general policyof H.U.G. has been not to oppose the Arab unity movement, as tnis would only incur Arab enmity, but on tne contrary to continue to show sympathy towards it, and, while leaving it to the Arabs themselves to formulate a practical scheme, to endeavour to guide it into non-objectionable channels. 4. How that the Arabs themselves have on their own initiative been able to set up an Arab League, it must clearly be the policy of H.M.G. to maintain their sympathetic attitude, and to endeavour to guide the new League's activities in such a way that they shall not run counter either to British interests or to the real interests of the Arabs themselves. I agree, moreover, with your view that there will be real advantages in continuing to promote general solidarity among the Arab States and in encouraging them to look to us for leadership and help. b. It is true that the Arab League may well play an embarrassing r61e if we have serious difficulties over Palestine or the Levant States, or even over our treaty rights in Kgypt or Iraq. So far, however, as Palestine or the Levant States \ are concerned, it has become clear in recent years that the whole Arab world will in any case be united on such topics and will expect its views to be taken into some account if our friendly relations are to endure. Moreover, one of the difficulties in dealing in the past with the Palestine problem has been the lack of any representative Arab body competent to handle the Arab case. The new organisation may well simplify this problem.Xcfy 6, The League would, I am sure, be well advised to concentrate mainly on its own internal affairs, i.e, on co-ordinating the economic and cultural relations of the Arab States and their various systems of administration, and on abolishing internal differences and divisions. Such a policy would command universal sympathy. There is, however, some danger that the League might devote itself instead to the more showy but dangerous task of agitating on behalf of Arabs outside the territories of the member States, e.g. in French i* 0 rth Africa or even the Persian Oulf Sheikhdoms. The wording of the annex to the Covenant regarding Arabs in non-independent Arab States, as quoted in your* telegram Ho. 730 Zpf March 26th_7, is unfortunate. Activities of this kind would in the long run do the Arabs no good and would cast doubt on the statesmanship of the new League, as being little better than an assembly of professional agitators, while incidentally any excessive interference in Horth African affairs at this stage would inevitably prejudice the Syrian and Lebanese settlements with France which we are now trying to arrange. I earnestly hope that we shall be able to guide the League, and in particular Axzam Bey, away from any such tendency, or indeed from any tendency to agitate for the revision of the Anglo-Egyptian or Anglo-Iraqi treaties. 7. To sum up, I agree that we should welcome the Arab League, that we should do what* A we can to smooth over its internal dissensions and that we should endeavour to guide its activities into useful channels. All H.M. Representatives in the Middle East will have to co-operate to this end. I agree that you should make informal a*id friendly representations to King Parouk or to tne Egyptian Government if necessary in order to avoid the isolation of the Ha s hi mite rulers.4. I ic.

The rivalry between Egypr and Iraq for the leading role m the Arab Union became evident from the beginning of the discussions. The Hashemites and Nuri so intimately associated with the Arab Movement from its early stages, were not unnaturally piqued at being ousted by a nev/comer from the major role. By a^natural process Ibn Saiid aligned himself with Egypt against, his old enemies, the Hashemifes and Nuri, The Lebanon, which was I earful of domination by .a still uneurop.eanised Muslim hinterland, naturally followed suit, regarding Egypt as more modernised and less fanatical than Syria and Iraq. Memqries of -Ibrahim Pasha were even evoked to promote closer relations between tne Lebanon and Egypt. Syria, which at the beginning was not enthusiastic-. . ally pro-Egyptian, has gradually evolved towards Egypt owing to the desire of the present governing elements in Syria to preserve the republican rdgime and their apprehensions of ^Hashemite designs on Syria. King Farouk has always treated the Emir Abdullah very superciliously and there is no love lost between them. More over inevitably a Hashemite Emir, with his dreams of a Syrian throne, would find himself in the opposite camp to that of the present Syrian rulers. It was equally inevitable tnat, m spite of rivalries between Abdullah and the Iraqi Royal family over Syria, the two Hashemite powers should find themselves standing together against the Egyptian bloc. 2. The latest phase of these developments has been the movement towards the conclusion of treaties between Egypt and Saudi Arabia, with the suggested adherence of Syria, and between Egypt and the Lebanon, The Hashemites are thus tending to be isolated in the Arab League* 3. The movement towards Arab Union, encouraged by our declaration of sympathy towards any attempt of the.Arabs to get together, started with the genuine desire to attenuate the^balkan- isation of Arab lands brought about mainly by the necessities of Anglo-French politics and with the equally genuine desire to protect Arab lands from outside.encroachment.2. 'n 4c Egypt'took the lead ? actuated at the beginning largely by reasons or internal politics. Nahas Pasha wished to strenthen his internal prestige by posing as a leader of the Arab world, and King Farouk wished to strengthen his throne by assuming a similar role. King Ibn Baud v/as from the beginning opposed to the idea of Arab Union because he feared it would mean a Hashemite domination of the Fertile Crescent with the- consequent danger to his own position in the Hejaz* Hence his determination to saboter any northern combination. The Lebanon ' was determined to preserve its complete independence in order to avoid absorption in a Muslim Bloc, The attitudes of the Lebanon and Ibn Baud led to the emasculation of the corporate idea of the League and that of the Lebanon to the attenuation of any executive function of the League, such as that involved in compulsory arbitration, Ibn Baud and the Lebanon were kept within the League largely by the influence of Egypt ? whose support in the Council they regarded as a guarantee against the dangers which they saw in it to their respective countries, Syria, after aiming at the creation of a Greater Syria under ihe rule of Damascus, acquiesced in the maintenance of the present divisions of the western part of the Fertile Crescent. This acquiescence was due to the fear that prosecution of the idea of a Greater Syria would drive the Lebanon back into French arms, Syrian acquiescence was no doubt also partly due to the influence’ of Egypt^ whose assistance it needed for its emancipation from France and for support Against Hashemite designs, 5. It is clear from all this that the influence of ' ' Egypt is a determining factor in the- present evolution of Arab States. It is also clear that the Hashemites are being relegated to the background, largely owing to Egyptian mani pulation of their rivals. This is- hot a nappy state of affairs. % are under obligations to the Hashemites for the r61e they ; played in the last war and for their stabilising influence m Transjordan and Iraq. As things are at present in the Arab world, it is not in our interest that Hashemite prestige should be weakened in those two countries. I submit therefore, that our efforts should be .directed against the isolation of the Hashemites within the Arab League. If we make representations to Ibn Saud against exclusive treaty making, we should make similar representations to King Farouk and the Egyptian .. Government. We can justify these representations by bur desire to promote union among our Egypto-Arab friends and to remove the danger that the present discords may wreck the League. 6., Arab Union has now been realised on paper by the'- formation of an Egypto-Arab Bloc of independent units preserving their often conflicting policies of the pre-League period. There will no doubt be much friction between tne members of the League and without our good offices these frictions are likely to end in a relaxation, if not disintegration of the League. It may no doubt be argued by some, on the principle of divide and rule, that such disintegration would not be contrary-to our interests.,. While on a short term view this is an arguable proposition, I feel that you will agree that on a long term view it is to our advantage that the Egypto-Arab world should not be distracted by internecine conflicts which will expose it not only to British but also to Russian penetration^ Moreover, the balkanisation of the Arab world leads to material retrogression which militates to provoke dis content in a large area lying across our lines of communications and containing our vital oil supplies. I suggest, therefore,-that we have a long term interest in promoting through Arab cooperation the material welfare and the satisfaction of the sentimental aspirations of these countries as far as our imperial interests permit. These aspirationsr * r aspiratioas, though often obscured by rivalries such as I have described, nevertheless constitute a permanent factor in the relations of these countries with G-reat Britain and moreover in the stability of the whole Middle East. 7. At present it may be said that the only ainson which all these States are'united are those of getting rid of the French from Syria and of preventing the Zionist domination of Palestine. Whatever discords may v/eaken the Arab League in the immediate future, we must count on its being united on these two issues.Department.

Copy No. Sir K. Cornwallis to Mr. Eden.—{Received 2bth November.) Baa dad. bth November, 1944. T eferred (No. 517.) Sir, /• _ / / IN paragraph 11 of my despatch No. 510 nf the 31st October, I referred briefly to the reception which had been accorded in Iraq to the decisions of the Preliminary Conference on Arab Unity, which met in Alexandria between the 15th September and the 7th October. It may be of interest if I analyse those reactions more fully. 2. Regarding most matters, it is not possible in this country to predicate any one feeling or view as representing “public opinion ’; each community tends to regard affairs, both internal and external, primarily from its own sectional point of view and with an eye to its own advantage. The Shia leaders are naturally not enthusiastic about the Alexandria Protocol. As good Arab patriots, they must at least give it lip-service, but as sectaries they are disturbed by the prospect of the Shias becoming a still smaller minority in a still larger Sunni world. They well know that they cannot enlist the support of their Persian co-religionists without appearing unpatriotic, and they are therefore forced into uneasy acquiescence in the official policy. To the Kurds, any step which strengthens, actually or potentially, their secular opponents, the Arabs, is unwelcome; and the Arab tribes are on the whole quite indifferent to what they no doubt regard as just another manoeuvre of their urban rulers. Nor can the Christian and Jewish communities be expected to acclaim the protocol with genuine satisfaction. 3. The general public (by which I mean .the politically-minded, newspaper- reading townsmen), like all general publics, is primarily interested in gaining its daily bread. But next to self-preservation there are few stronger stimuli than national pride; and there is to my mind no doubt that the general public were flattered and pleased by the success which the conference attained. It has made them feel that it is something after all to be an Arab; and Arab Unity undoubtedly appeals to the Iraqis very much as the reunion of Christendom appeals to Christians, namely as an ideal which, if incapable of immediate realisation, is nevertheless devoutedly to be. wished. 4. The fact that the Iraqi delegation was headed by the Prime Minister and included the forceful, if erratic, personality of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and above all (contrary to the wishes of Nahas and Ibn Sand) General Nuri-al-Said, who is the doyen of living exponents of Arab Unity, has naturally made Iraqis feel, not without reason, that their own country is taking a prominent, if not pre-eminent, part in the realisation of the ideal. Moreover, as I have suggested in my despatch under reference, Iraq has a very practical interest in Arab Unity, because she regards the Levant as her natural economic corridor, and is much concerned to see that the exits for her pipe-lines and her trade routes on the Mediterranean do not come under hostile, i.e., French or Jewish, control. 5. In paragraph 4 of his letter No. 48 (2) of the 19th October to you, Lord Moyne has mentioned that the aim of the conference seems to have been to unite the Arab World in co-operation with Britain. I have every reason to endorse this view. Both Nuri Pasha and the Minister for Foreign Affairs have said clearly and definitely that this was the aim of the conference, and that it was this which lay behind the clause of the protocol guaranteeing the present Lebanon frontiers. To me this is the most interesting and important aspect of the conference, because it shows that the Arabs have responded whole-heartedly and practially to the invitation which you, Sir, conveyed to them at the Mansion House on the 29th May, 1941, when you said : — “ The Arab World has made great strides since the settlement reached at the end of the last war, and many Arab thinkers desire for the Arab peoples a greater degree of unity than they now enjoy. In reaching out [60—29] Qy 1302 towards this unity they hope for our support No such an appeal from our friends should go unanswered. It seems to me both natural and right that the cultural and economic ties between the Arab countries, and the political ties too, should be strengthened. His Majesty’s Government for their part ^ will give their full support to any scheme that commands general approval.” This undertaking you reiterated in February 1942, and it has become known as “ The Eden Declaration.” At the time when it was made, many must have wondered whether the Arab World would ever unite in any practical way or direction, and still more whether they would be prepared to put themselves under the guidance and leadership of Great Britain. In Iraq it certainly seemed most unlikely; but, as you know, the change of feeling here during the past three and a half years has been deep and marked, and it is true to say to-day that the orientation towards Great Britain is popular here. The revolt of Rashid Ali profoundly shocked the pride and confidence of most thinking Iraqis. With their political instinct, whatever their feelings for Britain might then be. they were quick to see that the revolt, had it been successful, would have ranged them on the wrong side, and would have shattered their political hopes for perhaps a generation. 6. Apart from that, the generous policy of His Majesty’s Government in this country, both as regards the armistice terms and in many spheres since, has done much to conciliate the people of Iraq besides causing a great impression in other Arab States and particularly in Syria. The Atlantic Charter and similar declarations of the statesmen of the United Nations have also created a new feeling of confidence, here and throughout the Arab World, in Great Britain and her willingness to help the Arabs, and her determination to stand by her agreements. 7. It was this feeling, I am sure, which led the delegates to refer to the White Paper in dealing with Palestine. The declaration was so phrased, I under stand, because it was desired to find a form of words which would be not unacceptable to Jamal Hussaini, who had actually, despite Amin Hussaini s threats, initialled the White Paper (with trifling reservations), together with Musa al Alami in Nuri Pasha’s house in May 1940. It was therefore felt appropriate to make a reference to it. It seems to me that this acceptance of Britain’s last official statement of policy by and on behalf of the so-called extremist Palestine party, and its endorsement by the conference, is very significant. It means on the one hand that the Palestinian Arabs are now committed to an acceptance of the White Paper, and that we have the general support of the Arab World for the policy it enshrined. But, on the other hand, it means equally that any serious divergence from that policy will confront His Majesty’s Government not only with the hostility of the Palestine Arabs, but with that of all the signatories to the Alexandria Protocol. 'Jo them, the solution of the Palestine problem on the basis of strictly limited Jewish immigration, like the guarantee of Syria and the Lebanon, is an integral part of their scheme for Arab Unity, a movement which we have undertaken to support. If we oppose, in any important particular, the plan they have formulated, we shall at once be accused of having gone back on our undertakings. We shall lose the confidence that we have so laboriously built up over the past three years, and with it the friendship which has proved such an asset to us. 8. The Arab World, like the Western World, finds it hard to co-operate on cultural and economic matters, or the promotion of an idea, but an external threat will unite them as it unites us. Thousands to whom the theory or ideal of Arab Unity means little or nothing at all will enthusiastically support and share in any action undertaken to protect or preserve Syria or Palestine from what is conceived to be foreign aggression. Already, before the meeting of the Alexandria Conference, the Arab World had shown surprising solidarity on two occasions : first of all over the Lebanon crisis last November, and secondly over the protests to the United States Congress against the ” Wagner Resolution ” early this year. 9. There is, however, a profound difference between the reaction to the incidents which have so far evoked, and astonishingly evoked, united Arab action, and that to be expected should we adopt a policy contrary to the protocol. Hitherto the Arabs have been our friends and have remonstrated as friends. If, having assured the Arabs that their aspirations for unitv have our sympathetic support, we now 7 oppose their official plan for its attainment, they will be our friends no longer, and their opposition will be hostile and almost certainly violent. At this moment feeling in Iraq on Palestine and Syria and theKXT. 1037/45 Dear i ike ley.

Address of T 'T' HE war has receded a long way from the Middle East X and on every side there are signs of preparation for the coming peace. The Arab states have met together in prehminary conference to discuss the establishment of an Arab League. The Middle East Supply Centre has virtually ceased its control over imports and exports. Its American co-director, Mr James Landis, has returned to . America. A number of American business delegations are ouring the Middle East to establish contacts for post war trade. Business men and commercial delegations from hgypt and Turkey have gone to the United States. From the British side, however, there is so far not very much evidence of a new orientation. Yet the area is vital to British interests. There is no question of a British withdrawal after the war. On the other hand Middle Eastern problems are such that a policy of drift would carry Britain to nothing but disaster, l he old tutelary and mandatory relationship will not last on its own momentum. Self-government for Palestine can not be postponed indefinitely. In Egypt, nationalism has risen to a marked degree during the war and is causing me local British community some anxiety. The other Arab countries are likely to conform to the same pattern. Either the association of Britain with the Middle East must seem to the advantage of the states involved or it will lead to friction and deadlock and dangerous possi bilities of conflict with other Great Powers. There is no reason why Great Britain should not succeed in establishing a new relationship. There is no tundamental clash of interest. Britain is powerful enough to support the security of smaller nations, not powerful enough to threaten it. The political need of the Middle East-unity—and its economic need—^industrial develop ment and rising living standards—are aims which this country can both applaud and help to achieve. The two aims are really inseparable. If Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, Pales tine, Transjordan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the Yemen are to pursue their prosperity in division and competition, the result will be a repetition of such pre-war follies as the customs war between Syria and Lebanon or the tariff barriers between Palestine and its neighbours. Without unity there will be no prosperity ; and prosperity is the surest bond of unity. r r j ^ iere is undoubtedly an impetus towards unity in the rab world itself. The result of the preliminary conference on Arab unity held in Alexandria last October went further than many people expected. The protocol signed at the time by Iraq. Syria, Lebanon, Transjordan and Egypt and since signed by Saudi Arabia and the Yemen proposes the establishment of a League of Arab States. Its Council wou’d co-ordinate the external policies of the members, protect their independence, arbitrate between them on request and in general “ concern itself . . . with the affairs and interests of the Arab countries.” At the same time six Commissions were set up to prepare plans for closer co-operation in economic and financial affairs— tariffs, currency, agriculture, trade, industrial develop ment and commun cations. The procedure proposed was that when these Commissions were ready to report, the Middle Eastern Unity Preparatory Committee would meet again and summon a general Arab Congress. Elaborate constitution-drawing and commission-forming do not of thqmselves bring any plan to political birth. Although the aspiration to unity and co-operation is present in the Arab world, it is still too largely negative It represents the union of Arab states against the outer world rather than their desire to co-operate for positive purposes. Thus if their aspiration is to become reality, the outside world—in this case principally Great Britain -will have to assist them in two ways, by removing the grievances which give them spurious unity, and by substi tuting for negative defensive unity a genuine co-operation based on common interests and common policy. * The first move naturally turns on Palestine. The situa- k as d eter i° r ated. The attempted assassination of Sir Harold McMichael and the murder of Lord Moyne are sensational examples of the kind of terrorism that has broken out among the younger and wilder Jews. If the White Paper of I939&gt; promising the Arabs an end to Jewish immigration, were to be withdrawn, the terrorism would probably arise as fiercely on the Arab side. Without some new initiative, which can only come from the British Side, the Palestinen problem will be as bitter and in-- soluble as the Indian deadlock—and as damaging to British prestige. The solution that increasingly commends itse.f to uncommitted opinion outside Palestine—though it is perhaps too reasonable and moderate to get much of a hearing in the inflamed atmosphere of Palestine itself—is which has been outlined on a number of occasions in 7 he Economist. Its essence is the restoration of the old greater Syria by uniting Lebanon, Syria, Transjordan and parts of Pa.estine in an Arab state or federation, and the establishment of an independent Jewish state in the re mainder of Palestine. This would not meet the full Jewish claim for all Palestine, but it would give them control over immigration in a larger area than any envisaged in the various partition schemes. Such a policy could not, however, be achieved by political means alone. It would be necessary by the offer of loans and suitable capital deve’opment to convince the Arabs, particularly the Palestinian Arabs, that life in treater Syria offered them opportunities and prospects whxh their present divided existence does not provide. This point is part of the larger problem of underpinning Arab unity with stronger economic foundations, but in the matter of securing Arab acquiescence to a partitioned Palestine, it might be necessary to provide very special inducements. ' The larger objective—that of expanding the economic prosperity of the Middle East as a whole—is in the long nin the determining factor in the success or failure of British policy. There are two sides to the problem—the • willingness of the Arab states themselves to act together and the decree of help thev will rece : ve from the outside world. Capital development in the Middle East must depend very largely on Britain, the United States, andDepartment. PARLIAMENTARY NOTICE SESSION 194 M- - Af- $' P^' IC i. Undersecretary ...

Office of Minister ffesidenl' (jfL.E.), My dear Secretary of State, Cairo, l$th October, 1944. IN his despatch N^ 1V7Q 10 th Or-tnhpr Mr. Shone has analysed the protocol of the Preparatory Committee for the Arab Congress and commented oh the implications of its various clauses. In general I am in agreement with the views expressed by His Majesty’s Minister. It may be of use if I add a few comments on my own part, from the general Middle East point of view, based on the interviews which the various delegates had with me during their stay in Cairo, and on conversations with them which have been reported to me. 2. I should like in the first place to endorse the summing up of the outcome of the conference given in paragraph 10 of Mr. Shone s despatch. Whether or not the various resolutions are given immediate practical effect, the result of the holding of the conference and of the formation of the “League ” or “ Common wealth ” of Arab States cannot fail to tighten the ties joining the various States of the Middle East. The existence and strength of these ties was shown by the spontaneity of the reaction against the attempted French coup in the Lebanon in November 1943. To this general feeling of community there has now been added the machinery to give it concrete expression. 3. There is a further fact that emerges from a careful reading of the protocol and from conversations with members of the conference. The protocol envisages that the Arab world (or that part of it with which the protocol deals) should have one orientation, and one only, towards the outside world. This feeling has been expressed more and more in recent years, particularly in regard to the partitions of the Middle East which were carried out after the last war. It is now quite clear that the Arab States are convinced that there is not room for two orientations, taking different parts of the Arab world in different directions. The protocol expresses a growing sense of solidarity among the States composing the “Arab Commonwealth,” and a realisation that the deflection of one part of the area from the general line of development must affect the interests of the whole. 4. There is little doubt that the direction envisaged at present is that of co-operation with Great Britain. The Middle East group as a whole is willing, and indeed anxious, to co-operate with Great Britain on a basis of independence and free association. They believe that this will be to the mutual advantage of both, since it gives the best guarantee on the one side of the security of the Arab countries, and on the other side of the maintenance of British imperial communications. All the indications are, however, that a policy of political penetration on the eastern fringe of the Mediterranean, whether by Great Britain herself, or by other Powers with the assistance or acquiescence of Great Britain, would be interpreted as a threat to the essential interests of the whole “ Common wealth.” This could not fail to have an effect upon the present inclination of the Arab States to range themselves alongside of us, and might do so to such an extent as to cause them to overcome the misgivings which they probably feel as regards other possibilities and to look elsewhere for the support that they need. In this connexion it is important to recall that the recent recognition of Syrian and Lebanese independence by the U.S.S.R., which gave such satisfaction in the Levant States, is stated to be conditional on the two States not entering into an agreement which would give a specially favoured or “ pre-eminent” position to any one European Power. We must realise, in my view, that, if His Majesty’s Government is forced to adopt local policies in any part of the Middle East which are unacceptable to the majority of the Middle Eastern opinion, there is risk of the whole orientation of the Arab bloc of countries being changed to some other direction which might or might not be acceptable to us. 5. It is in this light that the special resolutions relating to the Lebanon and Palestine (clauses IV and V) can be read. It is implied in the former that, if there is any “ default” on the part of the Lebanon in allegiance to the objects [59—55] 127of the League as a whole—that is, if the Lebanon allows itself to be used as a foothold for undesirable European penetration into the Arab world—the other States of the League would no longer recognise the independence of the Lebanon “ within its present frontiers,” and would support Syria in taking back the predominantly Moslem, non-Maronite districts at present incorporated in the Lebanese State. This interpretation has been confirmed in conversation with several of the delegates. Similarly, as regards Palestine, it should be noted that. the protocol speaks of the engagements entered into by Great Britain as involving the stoppage of Jewish immigration, the safeguarding of Arab land and the leading of the country towards independence (an oblique reference, it would appear, to the principal clauses of the 1939 White Paper). It follows that, unless we are prepared to ensure those objects, we cannot avoid some measure of difference with the Arab world, and the risk which has been referred to is one that we cannot hope altogether to escape. 6. The delegates have, in conversation, expressed definite hopes that there will be forthcoming from His Majesty’s Government some sign of sympathy with their achievement, which they maintain is entirely in accord with the declaration made by you, Sir, in 1941. The reception given to the protocol by His Majesty’s Government may well be taken as an important “test case” for our future intentions in this part of the world. 7. It is also fair to say that the conference marks a considerable advance in constructive political thinking on the part of the Middle East States. The protocol looks to the future, not to the past. The era of recriminations over such matters as the MacMahon Correspondence seems at last to be over. The delegates have shown in conversations that they are aware of having made a fresh start and that they look for a response in kind from His Majesty’s Government. The general spirit in which the conference appears to have been conducted, and the lines of the protocol itself, show, moreover, that the States of the Middle East have not been slow to learn the new technique of international co-operation developed in war-time United Nations conferences such as those at Bretton Woods and Dumbarton Oaks. “ Regionalism ” is in the air, and it is noteworthy that it should be the newly-developed States of the Middle East who have taken the lead in attempting to work out a practical scheme of regional co-operation. Clause III of the protocol is of interest in this connexion. At the end of the third paragraph of his despatch, Mr. Shone suggests that the reference in this clause to post-war institutions is perhaps intended as a sop to the Syrians and Iraqis. More than one of the delegates, however, has stated in conversation that this clause is intended to leave the door open for the “Commonwealth” as a whole to join in any wider world organisation which may emerge in the post-war period. The Arabic text is obscure on this point, and is capable of either inter pretation. A copy of the Arabic, which is the official text, is enclosed^ with this despatch, and will repay comparison with the French translation, which is in some respects misleading. 8. Since the protocol was signed, there has been a change of Government in three of the signatory countries—Egypt, Syria and Transjordan. Although the coincidence has caused some remark, it seems to be beyond doubt that none of these changes was the result, direct or indirect, of the conference, nor do they imply any dissatisfaction in the countries concerned with the policies formulated at Alexandria. The Governments of Egypt, Transjordan and Syria fell on internal domestic issues which had been pending for some time, and in the two former cases it seems probable that the changes were actually held over until after the conclusion of the conference in order not to interfere with it. Arab unity ” is to a large extent a non-party matter in these countries, and the changes should not in practice have any great effect either way on the develop ment of the project. Isevertheless, it is unfortunate that these three Governments should have fallen in such rapid succession immediately after the publication of the protocol, since I am informed that His Majesty’s Government have already been accused on the Axis radio of engineering their fall in order to sabotage the Arab unity movement. 9. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Representatives at Cairo, Beirut, Bagdad and Jedda, the Acting High Commissioner for Palestine and the Governor of Aden. (*) Not printed.

Copy No. J () rJ Mr. Shone to Mr. Eden. — {Re/feivi (No. 11/9.) , CairoVlOth October, 1944. ’ WITH reference to my telegram No. 199 7 of the 8th October I have the honour to transmit herewith the * rench version ot the Erotocol of the 1 repaia iy Committee for the Arab Congress published in the Journal d Egypte ot the Hth C^ct/oloor 1044 2. The Protocol was so fully analysed in the telegram above referred to that 1 need not dwell on the details in this despatch. 3. It is evident that the resolutions adopted by the Preparatory Committee are of potential importance. Divisions and jealousies as well as the instability of the Arab States concerned may militate against effective implementation ot the resolutions, but, nevertheless, it is clear that discussions which ha\e been taking place for over a year between the Arab States have cleared the ground of impracticable ideas such as those oi immediate administrative unions oi federations and led the Arab States in the more practical direction ol Aia &gt; co-operation, political as well as economic, cultural and social. Moreover, a machinery has actually been proposed for giving permanency and method to this political co-operation, i.e., the Council of the League of Arab States, whose main purposes will be to consolidate relations between the Arab States and to safe guard their independence and sovereignty against aggression. It will be noted that the committee expressed the hope that this first step will lead to other results, especially in connexion with any post-war institution for uniting States generally. This is perhaps intended as a sop to the Syrians and Iraqis, who hanker after a Greater Syria or Arab Federation. 4. The particular resolution regarding the independence of the Lebanon within its present frontiers appears to have been due to conflict which arose during the proceedings between the Lebanese and Syrian delegations. The only reports which I have hitherto received of this incident come from an agent attached to the Palace and from Hassanein Pasha, both naturally prejudiced against Nahas Pasha. According to their accounts, Nahas Pasha, in full meeting, suggested to the delegates that they should produce the proces-verbanx of their separate meetings with him previously. He added that, if any of them wished to suppress any part of their proces-verbaux, they were at liberty to do so. The Lebanese and Iraqi delegates said that they had nothing to hide and produced their proces-verbaux. Saadallah Jabri Bey, Syrian Prime Minister and head of the Syrian delegation, looked very embarrassed, but finally said that he was a frank man and would not conceal anything that he had said. He then produced his proces-verbal, which contained passages against the Maronites and the Jews and suggesting a Greater Syria and the reduction of the Greater Lebanon to its old Little Lebanon frontiers. 5. Musa Mubarek, head of the Cabinet of the Lebanese President and one of the Lebanese delegates, said that he was the representative of the head of the Lebanese State, who was a Maronite, and that he must protest against this attack on the Maronites. The Lebanese delegates also protested against the proposal to reduce them to their pre-1920 frontiers. A reconciliation was patched up thanks to the intervention of Riad al Sulh, the Lebanese Prime Minister. 6. Subsequently King Farouk received the heads of the Syrian and Lebanese delegations as well as the head of the Transjordan delegation with a view apparently to smoothing over matters between the Syrians and Lebanese. As the head of the Lebanese delegation is a Muslim this step of the Palace seems to have been rather clumsy, for obviously the people who wanted quietening down were the Christian members of the Lebanese delegation. Incidentally, Nahas Pasha, according to Amin Osman Pasha, strongly objected on con stitutional grounds to the Monarch’s receiving, and discussing political matters with, Arab delegates without his Minister for Foreign Affairs being present. 7. The story recorded above may be too highly coloured but its main features were confirmed by the Transjordan Prime Minister in conversation [59—16] B(*) Not printed. 2 with the Orientai Counsellor. It is suggested that this apparently clumsy intervention of INahas Pasha may have far-reaching consequences and that the Lebanese will probably now be confirmed in their suspicions that the Syrians are out to devour them. It is further suggested that the Lebanese may revert to the old lines of Christian policy instead of that of the present Sacred Union between Muslims and Christians on the basis of independence. The result of such an orientation would be a reversion of Christian feeling in the Lebanon ii favour of Prance. The fear of Muslim domination is always lurking in the minds of the Lebanese Christians. 8. The references of Jabri Bey to the Lebanese in the proces-verbal of his separate discussions with Nahas Pasha are enclosed in Lord Killearn's despatch No. 1129 of the 8th December, 1943. The substance of these passages is that the Greater Lebanon was created by force against the wish of its inhabitants; that all Syrians yearn for a Greater Syria, but that they wish to settle the Lebanese question in a friendly way; that, if the Lebanon remained outside a Greater Syria and again became a focus of colonisation, Syria would have to reclaim the Muslim provinces which had been unjustly added to the Smaller Lebanon. Jabri Bey also referred to the difficulty of the religious, i.e., the Maronite, question. These references to the Lebanese are fairly objective and moderate but they were obviously not suitable for communication to the Lebanese, who are extremely susceptible to any suggestions for the reduction of their present territories. The declaration just made by the Maronite Patriarch, a press telegraphic version of which is enclosed,(') would seem to be part of the Lebanese reaction to the incident detailed above. 9. In this connexion, I would invite attention to the resolutions in the first part of the Protocol limiting the right of the Arab States to conclude agreements with non-rnembers to such as would not be contrary to the text or spirit of the Protocol and forbidding foreign policies prejudicial to the policy of the League or any one of its members. These resolutions may be aimed at Franco-Lebanese or Franco-Syrian treaties such as France is anxious to con clude. 10. As indicated in paragraph 3 above, it is not yet certain how much practical effect will be given to these resolutions. Nevertheless, it would be imprudent to ignore the fact that the result of this conference constitutes a step forward towards the political solidarity of the Egypto-Arab world against European encroachment. This political development will not only affect our position in the Arab countries proper but also in Egypt, which is on the verge of putting forward its claims for treaty revision, complete independence, &amp;c. The terms of these resolutions accentuate the unity of attitude to be adopted by the States of the Egypto-Arab world towards States outside it, of which we are the principal one. We are regarded as having promoted this Arab unity movement, and the general feeling still is that we will welcome its fruition. It is not impossible that this solidarity of the Egypto-Arab world may be conciliated with our essential interests of communications and oil supplies, provided we are able to adapt ourselves to the new conditions quickly enough. If, however, in addition to securing arrangements for the safeguarding of our above-mentioned interests we have also, in the interest of our world policy, to adopt local policies in Syria and Palestine unacceptable to the Arabs, there is little likelihood of our being able to bring a consolidated Middle East into friendly co-operation. In that event, we should have to maintain these essential interests of ours by force against a less disunited Egypto-Arab world. 11. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Minister Resident in the Middle East; the High Commissioner for Palestine, Jerusalem; His Majesty’s representatives at Beirut, Bagdad and Jedda; and the Governor, Aden. I have, &amp;c. TERENCE SHONE.k Odh g;jro : to i t qhsign office Mr. Shone No . 1997. 8th October, 1944. D, 8.16 p.ni. 8th October, 1944. R. 10.20 p.ra. 8th October, 1944. Repeated to Jerusalem Beirut Bagdad Jed da [][][] IMMEDIATE Following is summary of resolutions of protocol of Preparatory Committee for Arab Congress published in the Journal d’Egypte this morning. Part I. (a) League of ^rab States will be constituted by the independent-Arab States-who wish to join it. This League will have a Council in which the States will be represented on a footing of equality. Its mission will be to execute agreements which States conclude among themselves to organise periodical meetings in order to strengthen their relations and co-ordinate their political programmes with a view to realising co-operation and to safeguarding by every possible means their independence and sovereignty against aggression and to occupy itself generally with the affairs and interests of Arab countries. The decision of this Council will bind those accepting them except in the case of a difference between two States of the League which they have referred to the Council for settlement. In this case the decisions of the Council will have to be carried out (sic). In all cases it is forbidden to have recourse to force to settle conflicts between two States of the League. Each State, will have the right to conclude with another State, whether or not a member of the League, particular agreements which are not contrary to the text and spirit of these dispositions. In no case will a State be-allowed to follow a foreign policy prejudicial to the policy of the League or to any one or the member States. The Council will mediate in every difference susceptible of provoking war between a member State and another member or non member with a view to reconciling them. A commission will be formed of the members of the preparatory committee in order to elaborate the statutes of the Council and to examine political questions wnich could be the object of agree ments to be concluded between Arab countries. Part II. 3*1 •Jtmm • r * iTi * ^ - **. '* » •v* _N ^ 2 ' Part 2, The Arab States represented on the Committee will co-operate in economics cultural and social questions such as commercial exchanges customs currency agriculture industry , communications cultural questions nationality passports social, and sanitary questions etc. A Commission of experts in each category of these questions will he formed of representatives of the Governments which have participated in the Preparatory Committee in order to elaborate projects determining the means of co-operation. A 2. In these matters a commission of co-ordination will be formed to control the workings of these various Commissions and to put their resolutions in the form of draft agreements for submission to the different Governments. When all these Commissions will have completed their work the Preparatory Committee will meet again to examine results with a view to the convocation of a general Arab Congress. Part 3. The Committee hopes that the Arab countries will consolidate this first happy result by others especially if after the present war world events should lead to institutions which will unite states by closer and stronger bonds. Part 4. The States represented at the Committee unaimously affirm their respect for the,independence of the Lebanon within its present frontiers, which their Governments,have already recognised, after the Lebanon has followed a policy of independence proclaimed by its Government. Part 3. • •' (a) The Committee considers that Palestine constitutes one of the important elements of Arab countries and that the rights of the Palestine Arabs cannot be affected without danger to the peace and stability of the Arab world. The Committee considers that the engagements taken by Great Britain which involve the stoppage of Jewish immigration, the safeguarding of lands belonging to the Arabs and the progress (acheminement) of Palestine towards independence constitute acquired-rights for the Arabs and that their execution will be a forward step towards the goal, towards the strengthening of peace and stability. The Committee proclaims its support of the Palestine cause for the realisation of its legitimate aspirations and for the safeguarding of its just rights. The Committee declares that as much as anyone it has compassion for the sufferings which Jews have endured in Europe by the action of some dictatorial States but the case of these Jews must not be confounded with Zionism for nothing would be more unjust than to wish to settle the question of European Jews by another injustice of which would be the Palestinian Arabs to whatever religion or confession they belong (b) ...,A- r-§ 3. (t&gt;) The proposal coDoerning the participation of Arab Governments and peoples in the fund destined to preserve Arab lands in Palestine will be referred to the Commission of Economic and Financial questions for examination and submission of the result of the Preparatory Committee at its next meeting. The protocol was signed by all the Delegations except Saudi and Yemeni Delegations who postponed their opinion pending reference to their respective Kings.

As to enquiry whether Ibn Baud would meet Dr. Weizman, the King is prepared to receive anyone of any religion except (repeat except) a Jew. The Jews are a special case, and^there is an ancient enmity between them and the Arabs. The King is^ suspicious of Jewish treachery and can neither hold discussions with them, nor trust their [grp. undec.]. More particularly Ibn Baud considers Dr. vVeizman as his personal enemy for it was he who had the outrageous insolence to approach Ibn Baud and^to ask him to be a traitor to his religion and his country. This approach was made in the first year«of the.war when Dr. Weizman sent a certain European with request that Ibn Baud should abandon the ^ Arabs of Palestine in return for £20,000,000 to be guaranteed by . * President Roosev elt himself. The man dared to put this base suggestion to Ibn Baud and to suggest that the President would guarantee such a dishonourable proposal. Could anything be baser or more criminal than this? From this the President may^judge to what lengths the Jews are prepared to go in order to attain their object. 6. In reply to a question from Colonel Hoskins' enquiring what was the 'promise' referred to in paragraph 5 above, Ibn Baud said he was referring to 'the President s statement that after the war question of Palestine would be fully considered. Colonel Hoskfns also asked for an explanation of the King s statement that the immigration of the Jews into Palestine was in excess of - numbers stipulated in the White Paper (see paragraph 3 above). Ibn Baud replied that if illegal immigration were added to legal immigration it would be seen that numbers had exceeded limits stated. 7. Please repeat to Washington if necessary.

WAR CABINET STANDING OFFICIAL SUB-COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE MIDDLE EAST ARAB FEDERATION REPORT Great George Street, S.W. 1 23330ARAB FEDERATION. REPORT. 1. The following is an extract from the minutes of a meeting of Ministers held at the Foreign Office on the 26th September, 1941, (M.S.C. (41) 14, Item 5) : “ The Middle East Official Committee was invited to examine forthwith the various forms which a scheme of Arab federation might take and to report on their advantages and disadvantages and their practicability. In making this examination the Committee would pay special regard to the help such a scheme would afford to a solution of the Palestine problem. It was made clear in the course of the meeting that the Committee was expected to proceed on the assumption that, in the view of His Majesty’s Government, “ Arab federation ” was a development calling for favourable consideration on its own merits, quite apart from its bearing upon the question of Palestine. 2. We think it right to reproduce, at the beginning of our Report, the words used by Mr. Eden in his speech at the Mansion House on the 29th May, 1941, in which the attitude of His Majesty’s Government towards Arab federation has been defined. In the course of this speech, Mr. Eden said :— “ It seems to me both natural and right that the cultural and economic ties between the Arab countries, and the political ties, too, should be strengthened. His Majesty’s Government, for their part, will give full support to any scheme that commands general approval.' 3. No doubt as a result of this speech, the Saudi Arabian Minister in London suggested to Mr. Eden in August that it would be desirable for His Majesty’s Government to take the lead in preparing a scheme for Arab federation without awaiting the end of the war. It was afterwards ascertained that the Minister had acted without instructions from Ibn Saud, and, indeed, that his suggestion did not correspond to Ibn Saud’s wishes. The British Ambassadors at Cairo and Bagdad, the British Minister in Saudi Arabia, and the High Commissioner for Palestine were invited to put forward their observations on the Minister’s suggestion. One and all expressed the strong opinion that it would be unwise for His Majesty’s Government to promote a scheme for political federation at the present time, and they recommended that, if any action was to be taken, it should be confined to encouraging closer co-operation in the economic or cultural spheres.* 4. The Committee can only endorse the view that this is not the time for endeavouring to formulate and carry through a scheme of political federation. It is not without regret that we have reached this conclusion. From certain points of view it would appear that our means of influencing political developments in the Arab world are stronger now than they are likely to be in future years. Ibn Saud, the proved friend of this country, is perhaps the only Arab statesman with whom a satisfactory solution of many complicated problems might be reached. There is much to be said for taking the initiative while he is * Since these views were expressed the record of a conversation at Cairo on the 28th November, 1941, between General Catroux and Mr. Oliver Lyttelton, Minister of State, has become available. Discussing the future of the Arab world, General Catroux said that he was not one of those who believed that Arab Federation in any ambitious form was a practical possibility for as far ahead as one could see. The most that could be done in the measurable future was to look for some form of closer economic ties. Mr. Lyttelton expressed his entire agreement with this view: the dynastic, geographical, social and other differences between the Mohammedan countries were too great for any Arab Federation to be realised in the lives of ourselves or our grandchildren. The only progress that could be made was on the basis mentioned by General Catroux. He was glad to find that they were thinking on the same lines. It was most important that British and French policy on this question should be in concert.3 still at the height of his power. A second argument in favour of taking the initiative at present is that we now have in the Middle East a much stronger military force than we can ever hope to maintain there in time of peace, with the result that, for the moment at any rate, British influence is greater now than ^^4t is likely to be after our troops have been withdrawn. Thirdly, the grant of Independence to Syria and the Lebanon, and the supersession (to that extent) of the Syrian Mandate, may be expected to stimulate Arab aspirations elsewhere, particularly in Palestine and Trans-Jordan, where, as time goes on, there may be increasing agitation against the continued maintenance of the Mandatory regime. If it were practical politics to carry through some scheme of Arab federation which would also comprise a satisfactory solution of the Palestine problem, there would be much to be said in favour of immediate action, without awaiting the end of the war. 5. There are, on the other hand, strong arguments against an endeavour to promote a political federation of Arab States at the present moment. In the first place, there is nothing to show that Arab opinion is yet prepared for any scheme of federation.* Secondly, we believe that any scheme would in practice arouse such contentious issues that its discussion would inflame political passions throughout the Arab world, and probably also throughout the Jewish world. Thirdly, we are convinced that any scheme sponsored by His Majesty’s Government would be received with suspicion, and would probably arouse much unnecessary anti-British feeling, at a time when it is essential not to take any incautious step which might give our enemies in the Arab w r orld an opportunity for exciting agitation against us. It is mainly for these reasons that our representatives in the Arab countries have unanimously recommended that the main problem should be allowed to lie dormant until the present imminent dangers of war in the Middle East have passed. 6. As regards Arab opinion, we are given to understand that “ federation has never represented a fixed or genuine aspiration on the part of the Arab States or the Arab peoples as a whole, and must not be taken as one of the fundamental aims of the Arab national movement. So far as we are aware, there is at the present moment no Arab scheme of “ federation ' in existence. There is no evidence that, if His Majesty’s Government were to put forward such a scheme, it would meet with favour in any quarter. It is not always remembered that three at least of the Arab territories, viz., Iraq, Saudi Arabia and the Yemen, have enjoyed a full measure of independence for a number of years past. If they had wished to federate, there was nothing to prevent them; certainly there was no opposition or lack of goodwill on the part of the British Government. In fact, the three States have taken a certain step in this direction which merits closer examination. A treaty of “ Arab Brotherhood and Alliance ” was concluded between Iraq and Saudi Arabia in 1936, to which the Yemen acceded in the following year. The object of this treaty was &lt;£ mutual co-operation and under standing in regard to matters affecting the interests ” of the three Kingdoms, with a view to safeguarding the integrity of their territories; and the spirit actuating the contracting parties was based on “ the ties of the Islamic faith and racial unity ” which bound them together. The Articles included a number of undertakings for consultation and co-operation, but no attempt was made to set up any new political machinery or any form of joint political or administrative authority. This treaty (which has so far produced few tangible results in practice) is a fair measure of the Arab desire for unity as envisaged by the Arabs themselves. They have no desire to be absorbed in a single State or federation of States. Each unit is tenacious of its own individuality and its own independence. They may be willing to co-operate, when necessary, for a common * It is interesting to note what Colonel T. E. Lawrence wrote on the subject in 19*28: — “ When people talk of Arab confederation or empires, they talk fantastically. It will be generations, I expect—unless the vital tempo of the blast is much accelerated—before any two Arabic States join voluntarily. I agree their only future hope is that they should join, but it must be a natural growing-together. Forced unions are pernicious: and politics, in such things, should come after geography and economics. Communications and trade must be improved before provinces can join.” (See the Letters of T. E. Lawrence, page 577.) [23330] b 24 purpose, but none of them will recognise the hegemony of any other or subordinate local interests and aspirations to those of a larger whole.* 7. Any scheme of federation which we could devise would also raise many long-standing difficulties which are probably best left alone at this moment, there are difficulties arising from the intense jealousies among the rulers of the Araj|^^ States, between Ibn Saud and the King of the Yemen, between Ibn Saud ana the Hashimite rulers of Iraq and Trans-Jordan. There are difficulties due to rivalries between the inhabitants of the Arab States themselves, between Damascus and Bagdad, between Sunni and Shiah, Moslems and non-Moslems, desert-dwellers and townsmen. There are the strong objections which the French have always manifested towards any question of closer Arab union. Moreover, Arab suspicions have been aroused by the interest recently displayed by the Zionists in the project of Arab federation. At the present moment, the Arab States are quiet and are busied with other questions than that of federation. Neither in Palestine, nor in Syria, nor in Iraq, have the Arabs manifested any desire that His Majesty’s Government should take the initiative. Ibn Saud, for his part, told us not long ago that in his view all our efforts should for the present be devoted to winning the war, and that speculation on future political forms in Arab lands is only a distraction from the main aim. Still more recently, in conversation with a British Political Officer, he again laid emphasis on Arab disunity as a fatal obstacle to any successful plan of federation. 8. Nevertheless, while it may be undesirable for His Majesty’s Government to put forward at the present moment a wide scheme of political federation, it does not necessarily follow that no action whatever should be taken in connexion with the vague Arab wishes for some form of closer co-operation between the Arab States. On the contrary, it appears to us that His Majesty’s Government might suitably take action in two directions without awaiting the end of the war. In the first place, since Arab nationalism, and the wish for a closer unity between the Arab States, is almost certain to grow, it is very desirable to examine carefully the question of what our own future policy should be, and what form we should prefer that any future Arab co-operation should take. Secondly, we believe that there are certain restricted measures which might usefully be taken even at the present juncture with a view to encouraging closer co-operation between the Arab States. In general, we accept the conclusion of His Majesty’s representatives in Middle Eastern countries that it would be useful to study now some restricted measures of co-operation, with a view to showing practical sympathy with the Arab cause, and willingness to assist in removing some of the barriers which now separated the Arab States. 9. We have examined, as instructed in our terms of reference, a number of schemes of Arab federation, details of which are summarised in the Annex to this Report. We would point out that, in drawing up these schemes, we have ruled out any idea that some particular project should be imposed on the Arabs by force. We cannot contemplate, for example, a scheme for a federation under the supreme control of Ibn Saud to whom all the other Arab States would be invited, and in the last resort, compelled to subordinate themselves. The Ministerial meeting on the 26th September recorded the view that “ We could not force the Arab States into federation.” We can only record our full agreement with this conclusion. 10. As a result of our examination of these schemes, we have formed the opinion that Saudi Arabia, the Yemen and the other States of the Arabian Peninsula, are even more unsuited to participate in a scheme of federation than * The following is an extract from a Memorandum prepared by Mr. George Antonins, a prominent Palestinian Arab, at the invitation of the High Commissioner for Palestine, in October, 1940: — When Arabs speak of (Arab unity) they have in mind a somewhat looser association of separate States than is conveyed by the term Federation, an association which is to be achieved, first by attainment of independence and the removal of artificial (sc. imposed) frontiers and divisions, then by the strengthening of cultural and economic ties, and lastly, in some more or less immediate future, by the conclusion of such political conventions between the separate independent Arab States as time and trial may show to be in the best interests of the collective family of Arabic-speaking peoples. The conventions now in force in Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Yemen are examples in point, and their conclusion is universally regarded in the Arab world as a substantial realisation of their ideal of (Arab unity).”5 the less backward Arab countries further north. We are satisfied that L experiments in federation are to have any prospect of success they must at first be confined to Syria, the Lebanon, Palestine and Trans-Jordan. For the present our main action should be in the direction of securing closer economic co-operation between these four territories, and the British representatives in the Middle East should be invited to draw up a scheme on this economic (not political) basis ” =f ' - aor consideration by His Majesty’s Government and, if approved by them, by the Free French authorities. On the political side, we should have no objection to the now independent Syria and the Lebanon adhering to the existing treaty of “ Arab Brotherhood and Alliance.” On the cultural side, our representatives in the Middle East could be asked to consider what non-political projects of a cultural nature, designed to establish closer harmony between the Arab States, are deserving of encouragement. 11. We have given attention, when examining these problems, to the difficult question of how British interests and British strategic needs can best be safe guarded if, as we believe is probable, the Arab Nationalist movement grows in importance, and Arab federation becomes a more immediate problem than it is at present. Unfortunately, the pan-Arab movement, the more extreme form of Arab nationalism, is largely inspired by anti-foreign motives. The Aiab desire for a closer union, in so far as such a desire exists, is in effect a wish to form a block of Arab States which will be strong enough to secure what are considered to be Arab rights in Palestine and Syria, and to present a united front to foreign Powers, especially Great Britain and France. It may easily be supposed that the movement for Arab federation is likely to degenerate into an anti-British, anti-French and, above all, an anti-Zionist and anti-Jewish movement. This is a very real danger. It is for this reason that it is so important that His Majesty’s Government should not content themselves with a purely negative policy, but should show positive sympathy towards the movement and endeavour to guide it so far as possible, on lines which are both advantageous to the Arabs themselves and not incompatible with British interests. 12. It is important, in any case, that those responsible for British policy in the Middle East, if they are to endeavour to guide the movement on lines which are compatible with British interests, should bear in mind British strategic needs in the Arab States. Essential British interests in the Middle East have been defined as communications and oil. It is clear that we shall at least require to maintain those naval, military and air facilities which are essential to protect those interests. These are all points which will call for full consideration at the proper time. 13. We have also considered, as required by our terms of reference, how far a scheme of Arab federation might assist a solution of the Palestine problem. On this point proposals have been put forward in various quarters which, in our view, fall entirely without the range of practical politics. It has been suggested, for example, that Ibn Saud, in return for British support for some scheme of Arab federation under his own supreme control, and in consideration of certain financial inducements, might be persuaded to give the Jews a free hand in Palestine and allow them to turn Palestine into a Jewish State. We cannot regard such a suggestion as deserving of serious consideration. It is quite certain that a man of Ibn Saud’s high spirit and honourable character could not be bribed or cajoled into taking a step which every Arab would regard as a shameful surrender of Arab interests. 14 14. At the same time, we do not rule out all possibility that a scheme of Arab federation might assist in a solution of the Palestine problem. It is necessary, however, to be clear exactly what we mean by the phrase “ a solution of the Palestine problem.” What we have in mind is the replacement of the Mandate by some permanent system of Government in Palestine, which shall be acceptable alike to both Jews and Arabs. The prospects of both communities agreeing on such a solution are admittedly very slight. Nevertheless, it is just conceivable that the Arabs, if they wish to secure the disappearance of the Mandate and the participation of Palestine in an Arab Federation, might be willing to acquiesce in a greater degree of Jewish penetration than they^would otherwise contemplate, and that the Jews of Palestine on their part might come [23330] ° c6 7 to understand that the best prospect for the future of the Jewish National Home lies in a genuine endeavour to come to terms with the Arabs within the Iramewo nf n sphpmp of federation. 15. The formation of a joint Arab-Jewish State was the solution contemplated by the White Paper'of 1939 (Cmd. 6019). There is an alternative solution, viz., that based on the establishment of a distinctively Jewish State* in a part of Palestine. Unfortunately it cannot be supposed that such a reversion to the partition proposals of 1937 would ever be acceptable to the Arabs. 1 he latter would never agree to allow the Zionists unrestricted control of Jewish immigration. Nor is it conceivable that a Jewish State, confined within a part of Palestine, and exercising only restricted control over its own immigration, would be accepted by the Jews. 16. Our general conclusion is that, while it might be possible to find a solution of the Palestine problem within the scope of a federal scheme, there is no great likelihood that any scheme for political federation which would include Palestine could be successfully launched unless the Arabs and the Jews in Palestine had acquired a greater readiness for compromise and collaboration than exists at present. 17. Our recommendations regarding further action may be summarised as follows :— («) Economic co-operation. —‘British representatives in the Middle East should be invited to draw up a scheme for closer economic co-opera tion, and removal of economic barriers, between Syria, the Lebanon, Palestine and Trans-Jordan. If their recommendations are approved, they should be put to the Free French, and an endeavour should be made to bring them into force. (b) Cultural co-operation. —Uis Majesty’s representatives should be invited to consider what non-political cultural contacts between the Arab States are deserving of encouragement. (c) No objection should be raised to the extension of the “ Treaty of Arab Brotherhood ” by the adherence of other independent Arab States, such as Syria and the Lebanon; and. indeed, encouragement might be given to such a proposal if it were initiated by the parties concerned. (d) A study could, if necessary, be made of our post-war strategic require ments in the Arab States, and of the means by which they can best be reconciled with French rights, with the aspirations of the Jews and Arabs, and with our existing obligations. It will, however, be realised that such a study cannot, at this stage, lie other than of a very general nature. Signed on behalf of the Committee : J. E. SHUCKBURGH, Chairman. Great George Street, S.W. 1. January 9, 1942.7 ANNEX. Schemes for Arab Federation. A .—Political Federation. The territories concerned are— {a) The Kingdom of Egypt. (b) The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia; the Kingdom of the Yemen; the Sheikhdom of Koweit; the Sheikhdom of Bahrein; the Sheikhdoms of Qatr and Trucial Oman; the Sultanate of Muscat; the Colony of Aden and the Aden Protectorate. (c) The Kingdom of Iraq. (d) The Republics of Syria and the Lebanon (each independent, but still under French Mandate); the British Mandated territories ol Palestine and Trans-Jordan. As regards Egypt, Sir M. Lampson reminds us that she considers herself the natural leader of the Arab world and would probably want to play some pai t in schemes of Arab federation. The chance of Egypt being willing to limit her own political independence by joining a confederation of Arab States seems, however, to be so remote that it has not been thought necessary to pursue this suggestion in further detail. Scheme I .—Federal scheme on a comprehensive scale covering the whole Arabian Peninsula, Iraq, Syria, Palestine, &amp;c. (i.e., all the territories named in (b), (c) and (d) above). The constituent States would retain their independence of each other, and could maintain their separate treaty and diplomatic relations with foreign Powers, if desired. They would send delegates to a federal assembly. The presidency of the confederation might be held in rotation; or, preferably, Ibn Saud might be president for life. The federal assembly would have power to deal with certain specified questions, and federal laws would on these questions take precedence of those of each individual State. The constituent States would have a number of votes on the assembly, roughly in proportion to the size of their population. Each constituent State would remain responsible for keeping order m its own territory. There would be federal machinery available for settling disputes between the constituent States, but, if hostilities broke out, there would be no obligation on other members of the confederation to join in the hostilities. External aggression against one of the constituent States would, on the other hand, be the concern of the federation as a whole. The confederation could not stand alone, and would require a military guarantee from His Majesty’s Government, who would in return require guarantees safeguarding British interests and British strategic needs. As part of the new arrangements, an endeavour should be made to secure Arab and Jewish consent to a solution of the Palestine problem, involving the abolition of the Mandate, new arrangements for Trans-Jordan, and for the Jewish National Home. A dvantages. (1) Such a comprehensive scheme would show Arabs that we are taking seriously their talk about “ unity. # (2) It would show the world at large that His Majesty s Government were taking a wide view of post-war settlements. (3) An Arab organisation of this magnitude might be more prepared to make concessions to the Jews on the Mediterranean seaboard. Disadvantages. (1) There is good reason to suppose that any such scheme would make no appeal to the Arab rulers concerned, e.g., Ibn Saud, the King of the Yemen or the Emir Abdullah of Trans-Jordan. Nor is there reason to believe that it would be supported at present by any of the Arab States.8 (2) His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda has pointed out that it is difficult to see how Saudi Arabia could usefully participate in any scheme of federation. That backward country has little contribution to make to a federation and could not derive any advantage from federation. (3) The Yemen is an even less promising member, nor are the Sheikhdoms of^ the Persian Gulf at all qualified. (4) The difficulties of fitting in the Aden Protectorate are obvious. Practicability. A confederation which would include Saudi Arabia, the Yemen, the Persian Gulf States. Muscat and the Aden Protectorate is likely to be impracticable for many years to come. If there is to be any progress towards political federation, a start will have to be made in the more progressive Arab countries further north. Scheme 11. —A. federal scheme on a more restricted scale, covering Iraq, Syria, Palestine, &amp;c., hut omitting Saudi Arabia and the other States of the Arabian Peninsula. It is sufficient to say that rivalry between Ibn Saud and the Hashimite family is such that Ibn Saud would regard a federal scheme on these lines as directly opposed to his vital interests. For this reason alone, it would be best to make a start with Syria, the Lebanon, Palestine and Trans-Jordan, leaving Iraq out of the picture until a later stage. Scheme 111. —A federal scheme applying only to Syria, the Lebanon, Palestine and Trans-Jordan. The essence of this scheme is that federal machinery should be established to deal with political, as well as economic, matters affecting the four territories. The greater the powers which could be given to the federal machinery, the greater chance there would be that the scheme might assist towards a solution of the Palestine problem. All Middle Eastern experts are agreed that, if Arab federation is to be brought about, Syria, the Lebanon and Palestine are by far the most suitable territories, and a start might well be made there. “ Greater Syria ” was a single unit in the past, under Turkish rule. Its separation into Syria, the Lebanon and Palestine was (as the High Commissioner for Palestine has pointed out) a defiance of history and has been responsible for much trouble. There is, in fact, an underlying unity between the three territories. The present boundaries between them are unnatural and indeed indefensible on any accepted principles. The difficulties are, however, very great. (a) The French have always objected strongly to Arab federation. The Free French will certainly oppose any far-reaching scheme for closer political union between Syria and the Lebanon on the one hand and Palestine and Trans-Jordan on the other. From the French point of view, this might be regarded as a manoeuvre for increasing British influence in the Levant at the expense of French influence. (b) As regards Palestine, the scheme would involve the termination of the British Mandate, and the difficulty would lie in replacing the mandatory regime by some arrangement acceptable to both the Arabs and the Jews. It is arguable that there mav be, under this federation, a better chance of solving the question of the Jewish National Home; at any rate, it would provide a larger and different framework within which to find a solution, when the prospects of finding one within the smaller limits of Palestine alone are not favourable. It is important, however, to remember that the termination of the Mandate, and the future arrangements with regard to the Jews in Palestine, would have to form part of the scheme from its inception. The successful launching of the scheme, with the goodwill, or at least the acquiescence, of both Arabs and Jews, would thus seem to require a greater readiness for compromise and collaboration than has yet developed in Arab- Jewish relations. (c) As regards Trans-Jordan, it would be difficult to leave Trans-Jordan out of any scheme which included Palestine, Syria and the Lebanon, but it would be equally difficult to fit the Emir Abdullah into any such -»9 scheme. We should have to show in some way that we recognised the Emir Abdullah’s loyal services to us for the past twenty years. Any proposals, however, that the Emir Abdullah should become King of the whole area would be strongly resisted by Ibn Saud. For these three reasons, viz., French suspicions, the necessity for a solution Sf the Palestine problem, and the Emir Abdullah s position, it is considere essential to confine our proposals, at all events at first, to the economic sphere (see Scheme V below). Scheme IV. —A development of the Treaty of Arab Brotherhood and Alliance This Treaty, which provides for consultation and co-operation, was concluded in 1936 between Iraq and Saudi Arabia. The Yemen acceded in 1937 ihe suggestion now for consideration is whether this Treaty might be extended, an its provisions reinforced, to provide the basis for Arab federation. lor example, Syria and the Lebanon, now that they have acquired their independence, might be encouraged to accede to the Treaty. Then, in due course, arrangements mig t be made for representatives of the parties to the Treaty to meet from time to time to discuss questions of joint interest, and put into effect the provisions regarding consultation between the parties to the Treaty. In this way, regular federal machinery might be gradually developed. A dvantages. There would be advantage in building upon the foundation of an existing treaty, particularly on a treaty concluded between Arab rulers on their own unprompted initiative. Disadvantages. It would be more difficult for His Majesty’s Government to exercise any cmiding influence if federation were to take this form. It is cleai that, so long as the ^British Mandate continues, Palestine could not adhere to a “ Treaty of Arab Brotherhood ”; and its exclusion might tend to give the federation an increased tendency to criticise and oppose British policy and Jewish aspirations in Palestine. It is to be noted, however, that so far the existing “ brotherhood has taken little or no effective action; and it is possible that increased membership would not lead to greater activity. . , If Syria and the Lebanon should wish to adhere to the Treaty ot Arab Brotherhood, there is no reason why His Majesty’s Government should not encourage the movement. B.— Economic Co-operation. In general, the removal of economic barriers should be encouiaged, but L would seem best to make a start with Syria, the Lebanon, Palestine and Trans-Jordan. Scheme V. —Economic Co-operation between Syria, the Lebanon, Palestine and Trans-Jordan. . . . The Minister of State has recommended that British representatives in the Middle East should be instructed to draw up such a scheme. This suggestion should certainly be approved. In the meanwhile, no attempt has been made in London to work out detailed proposals. A dvantages. A purely economic (not political) scheme would seem to be in the general interests of the four territories mentioned, and there seems no reason why the Free French should necessarily object. It is to be hoped that the removal of the economic barriers may reduce the unnecessary inconvenience arising from the present artificial frontiers. It should be noted, however, that measures of co-operation in the economic sphere are likely to lead to a desire for measures of co-operation in the political sphere, viz., a scheme started on these lines might develop on the lines of Scheme III above.C .—Cultural Co-operation. The British Ambassador at Bagdad wrote as follows in a recent despatch :— Cultural barriers could possibly be removed by establishing closer harmony in school curricula, by periodical cultural conferences, by the publication of journals of common interest to all, by the exchange of students*^_ in higher educational institutions and similar devices.” There seems to be no objection to British representatives in the Middle East being authorised to encourage such cultural contacts between the Arab States. It is perhaps worth noting that it is in these matters within the cultural sphere that Egypt comes into the picture. Cairo is regarded by the Egyptians as the cultural centre of the Arab world. It is not certain how far it would be wise for His Majesty’s Government to take the initiative in cultural questions affecting the Arab States, but we can at least show ourselves ready to welcome and support any initiative taken by the Arabs themselves.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRIT ANNIC MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT May 13, 1943.

HIS Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad presents his compliments to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and has the honour to transmit to him a copy of a memorandum by Sir K. Cornwallis, dated the 26th April, 1943. for the Middle East War Council : The Present Situation m Iraq. Bagdad, s 2iSth April, 1943. Enclosure. The Present Situation in Iraq. Memorandum by Sir Kinahan Cornwallis for the Middle hast War Council. RELATIONS between Great Britain and Iraq are established on the provisions of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of Alliance of 1930 and the Iraqi Govern ment are at present carrying out satisfactorily their wartime obligations towards His Majesty’s Government under article 4 of this treaty. With the co-operation of the Iraqi Government Axis propaganda has been virtually eliminated and all persons whose activities were seriously prejudicial to harmonious relations between Great Britain and Iraq have been interned or have fled the country. In January 1943 the Iraqi Government, entirely on their own initiative, declaied w 7 ar on the Axis Powers and signed the declaration ot the United Nations. Since then the Cabinet have been making a sincere, if not always very effective, effort to improve the country’s economic contribution to the common war effort. Cui rent relations with His Majesty’s Government may therefore justifiably be called good. Internally the situation is tranquil, though there is a certain effervescence of vouth, which tends at the moment to show a somewhat “ red tinge. These two outstanding features of the present political situation, good relations with His Majesty’s Government and internal tranquillity, which are in such contrast with the hatred and strife of April and May 1941, are attributable to three mam factors, the turn of the tide of the w 7 ar in our favour, the presence of strong British forces, and the comparative calm of the contemporary political situation in Palestine and Syria. Iraq and Arab Union. Since her earliest days Iraq has always been strongly represented in the van of the pan-Arab movement, and her people have never failed to take a close and deeplv sentimental interest in the political fortunes of her closest Arab neighbours Palestine and Syria. The disturbances in Palestine in the late thirties diverted attention from ideas of Arab unity and federation to the more urgent issue of the fate of Palestine and her Arab population, and the outbreak of war with Germany ao-ain, for a time, put into the background thoughts of rebuilding the Arab empire of the past. Recently, however, faith in the ultimate victory of the United Nations and confidence in the Atlantic Charter have brought about a revival of activity directed towards a closer union of the now divided Arab states and peoples. The statement made by Mr. Eden m the House of Commons on the 25th February of this year reaffirming the sympathy of His Majesty’s Government with any movement among the Arabs to promote economic, cultural or political unity has, moreover, acted as a spur to the political leaders who are now seeking to formulate a scheme which will be able to command general approval. The protagonists of the pan-Arab movement in Iraq are the veterans of the Arab revolt of 'the war of 1914-18. They have no declared programme, but there [42-3]2 is small doubt that their ultimate objective is the inclusion of all the Arab peoples in both Africa and Asia in a single Arab State. They appreciate, however, that this can only be achieved gradually by stages, and their immediate aim is to help Syria and Palestine to win independence as a necessary preliminary to their union with Iraq. They see that neither Iraq nor Syria nor Palestine is strong enough to dispense with the support of a Great Power, but they hope that when united in a political and economic unit these countries will be able to stand alone without the invidious support of a foreign alliance and the concomitant limitation of their national sovereignty. Though they are ready to accept schemes for closer cultural and economic co-operation between these countries as helpful preliminaries, such expedients will not deter them from continuing to work for the earliest possible implementation of measures which will enable Palestine. Syria and Iraq to devote their united strength to the Arab cause. These pan-Arab leaders enjoy considerable support among their contemporaries and generally among the Sunni Arabs of the country. Most of them are now well disposed towards ourselves and, in spite of many disappointments in the past, subscribe to the principle that Arab aspirations can only be achieved through close and friendly co-operation with Great Britain. The Shiahs, who number more than half the Arab population of the country, are, however, showing little enthusiasm for the federation idea. For some time they have been absorbed in the task of winning political equality with the Sunnis, and they foresee that if Iraq is at all closely federated with the other Arab States, they may again recede into the status of a {kditically impotent religious minority. The half million Kurds are another important element in the country, indifferent, and to a small extent opposed, to pan-Arab ideals, and even among the Sunni Arabs a number of the younger men interested in politics take the view that federation should be postponed until many fundamental social and economic reforms have been carried out within Iraq itself. The leaders of the federation movement have not up to the present shown much sign of being discouraged by the negative attitude of the elements mentioned above, but the outcome of the recent pourparlers of Jamil Madfai and Tahsin al Askari with political leaders in Syria and Hgypt has evidently proved disap pointing to them. It is not yet clear what further steps they will now decide to take, but they are not likely to let the matter drop for long. A branch of the Arab Union Club founded by Fuad Abbaza Pasha of Egypt has recently been established in Bagdad, but it is as yet too early to judge whether it will play an active part in Arab politics. Iraq and Syria. It has already been mentioned that Iraqis have for long taken an interest in Syria’s struggle for independence. When British forces entered the country in 1941, there were hopes that Syria would rapidly be set on the path already trodden by Iraq. Disappointment and irritation followed with the creation of the Taj ud Din Government, and what appeared to be the reluctance of the Free French authorities to restore the Constitution, and the opportunity of Mr. Wendell Willkie’s visit to Bagdad in September 1942 was taken to submit to him a memorandum signed by two ex-Prime Ministers and the President of the Senate, urging the intervention of the United States to secure for Syria her legitimate rights. A pointed reference to Syria’s struggle for independence was also made in Nuri Pasha’s reply to the message which Mr. Churchill sent to him on the occasion of Iraq’s declaration of war on the Axis. Political developments since the death of the late President have, however, given considerable satisfac tion to political circles in Iraq and there is now less anxiety about Syria’s future prospects. Palestine. Iraq’s interest in Palestine has been even deeper than her interest in Syria and, since the end of the last war, w henever there have been political disturbances in Palestine, strong reactions in favour of the Palestine Arabs have been evident in Iraq. At the beginning of the present war the ex-Mufti of Jerusalem and a large number of his most determined followers were in Iraq. Their anti-British propaganda among the people and their intrigues with the remaining diplomatic representatives of the Axis Powers were a serious menace to our position, and were to a noteworthy degree the cause of Rashid Ali’s open defiance of his Majesty’s Government in May 1941. Since the restoration of a constitutional and friendly3 Government, in deference to Iraq’s alliance with Great Britain, a tacit truce has been observed in agitation about Palestine, but towards the end q|, 1942.,news of Jewish arming in Palestine and of Zionist propaganda in Ameriek phused fears to be felt in this country that the Zionist Jews were taking advant&amp;geTTf this'Arab quiescence to strengthen their own position. During a visit to Cairo in December 1942, the Prime Minister discussed with Nahas Pasha the idea of addressing a lest to the United States Government to dissuade their prominent citizens from making public statements favourable to militant and extreme Zionism, and also endeavoured to induce King Abdul Aziz al Saud to take parallel action. In March 1943 the Iraqi Government communicated a memorandum to His Majesty’s Government in which concern was expressed at the increase of Zionist propa ganda in Great Britain and the United States, and added that the Iraqi Govern ment could not overlook the possible effect of such propaganda in Iraq, where the people were deeply interested in the Palestine question. His Majesty’s Govern ment, in their reply, drew attention to the answer given by the then Secretary of State for the Colonies to a question by Lord Davies in the House of Lords on the 6th May, 1942, in the following words : “ While I would make it clear that there has been no change in the policy of His Majesty’s Government with regard to Palestine, the noble Lord may rest assured that His Majesty’s Government will not enter into commitments regarding the future of that country without prior consultation with those including both Arabs and Jews whom they may judge to be concerned.” The reply added that the policy reaffirmed in that statement remained that of His Majesty’s Government. This reply appears to have been accepted. The general attitude of Iraqi Arabs towards the Palestine question is that they are resigned to the policy of the Palestine White Paper of 1939 and regard it as the declared and accepted policy of His Majesty’s Government. They look forward to the early implementation of its constitutional provisions, and many hope that this having been done the way will be clear for Palestine to enter into closer political, cultural and economic relations with her neighbours. Any material whittling away of the safeguards provided for the Arabs in the White Paper, and especially any relaxation of its restrictions on Jewish immigration, would be regarded as a serious breach of faith and would provoke dangerous reactions in this country, where our politico-strategic interests are likely in the difficult post war years to assume even greater importance than they do to-day. In particular, the large Jewish community would be in jeopardy. The Iraqi Prime Minister has set out his personal views on the future of Palestine and Syria and on the Federation of the Arab States in a lengthy memorandum which he addressed in January last to the Minister of State at Cairo. It began with a renewed protest against current Zionist claims and propaganda, went on to review the recent history of Syria and Palestine, and concluded with a recommendation that the United Nations should immediately declare the federation of Syria, the Lebanon, Palestine and Transjordan into one State and promote the formation of an Arab Union, to which this Greater Syria and Iraq should adhere at once and other Arab States join at will. 26^/f April, 1943.2 fJpJpC'ftpere^T * for Doniinlos ‘TaSs'^l.

AFTER our conversation about the future of the Arab States I decided to follow your advice and write a memorandum on the subject showing my personal interpretation of the problems facing us and putting foward my suggestions for their solution. The attached note has been prepared by me in my personal I capacity, and although I know that several of my colleagues and other Iraqi leaders have similar views, yet I do not wish it to be regarded in any way as a statement of the Iraqi Government’s policy. As you are very busy these idays and cannot be expected to read up the details of pledges and promises made twenty-four years ago, and all the discussions that have taken place since, I have tried to give as briefly as possible a summary of what has happened since the end of the last war. While my reading of the past differences between the Arabs and the British and the French is perhaps not unnaturally coloured, I have for the purpose of this note treated the subject as objectively as I can. In view of the recent activities of Zionist organisations in England and America I feel that some declaration should be made by Great Britain and the United States regarding the future of the Arab territories which formerly formed part of the Ottoman Empire. The Palestine Post on the 2nd November, 1942, gave prominence to a report of a public demonstration held in London on the 1st November under the auspices of the Zionist Federation. Messages of sympathy were sent by a number of prominent persons who are entitled to their own views, but we were surprised that two serving Secretaries of State sent messages of sympathy. The Zionist Federation has always declared that by a national home in Palestine they mean an independent Jewish State and sympathy with Zionism implies support of their policy of creating such a State in Palestine, although the British Government has frequently and categorically declared that that is not her policy. In Iraq we are not allowing news of this kind to be published, as we do not want Arab feeling to be inflamed against the Jews and the British. But, if the Zionists and their sympathisers are allowed to continue their propaganda, it will be very difficult for Arab leaders to restrain Arab journalists and politicians from initiating counter-propaganda in the Arab States. Unfortun ately, in England and America, friends of the Arab cause have always experienced m-eat difficulty in securing publicity for their views, and now in war time the position is worse owing to the shortage of nevEjiilfaaflftff. MtlTOYfil, [39—39]mama wmmem r 2 terrible persecution which the Jews are suffering in Germany, Italy and occupied Europe naturally evokes sympathy for Jews generally and any body who writes or speaks against Zionism is in danger of being regarded as condoning these persecutions. Some time ago there was an agitation by the Zionists to create a Jewish army in Palestine and elsewhere to fight against the Axis. The British Government refused to be persuaded. But taking advantage by the present^^ disclosures of Jewish massacres in Poland and Germany, the Zionists are agar^^^ pressing for a Jewish army and have succeeded in enlisting very strong support for it in the United States. A Jewish army unconnected with Palestine is no concern of the Ambs in Palestine or of the Arab States. But will the Zionists be content with a Jewish army divorced from the Jewish National Home or Zion (Palestine) ? If there is any intention of recruiting such an army in Palestine or using it in Palestine or neighbouring Arab countries, the Arabs are bound to consider that the intention is to force the Allied Nations to accept the Zionist demand for a Jewish State, and that this army’s ultimate purpose will be to fight the Arabs for the possession of Palestine. As you know, some Jews are boasting that already in Palestine they have the nucleus of an army with stores of rifles, machine guns and grenades. I am inclined to disbelieve this, but if such claims continue to be made they will cause further alarm to the Arabs there. Hr. Chaim Weizmann, the Zionist leader, in an article in Foreign Affairs, an American quarterly, for January 1942, again urges the creating of a Jewish State in Palestine, and writes as if. it is bound to be established after this war. From 1919 to 1922 he expressed the same views ; then, when he realised the strength of Arab opposition to these claims, he modified them. Now he lias revived them. I feel that if the United Nations made a definite pronouncement now to the effect that they will not support the creating of a Jewish State in Palestine, but adhere to the policy laid down in the White Paper of 1939, the Zionists would make protests, of course, but would accept the decision as final. They believe that it is possible, in the course of a great struggle such as the present war, to exact promises which would not be made in time of peace. So their extreme claims should be refused categorically now. At the same time, if you agree with my suggestion, it would be possible for the United Nations to guarantee the future of the Jewish National Home as it exists at present in Palestine with all the possibilities of its normal semi-autonomous development within the fabric of a greater Syria and an Arab League. I invite your consideration of these matters as I am of opinion that, unless both the Zionists and their British and American sympathisers cease their propaganda during the war, the Arabs will start their owm propaganda and that the Axis Powers will seize the opportunity, so presented, to create bad blood between Great Britain and the Arabs of the Near and Middle East. Yours sincerely, NOURY SAID. A j'' Sub-enclosure. Note on the A rab Cause, with Suggestion for the Solution of its Problem. THE Arab peoples can be divided into two main groups : (1) those living in Africa, and (2) those living in Syria, in Palestine, in Iraq and in the Arabian peninsula. Although in the second group the Arabs of the Arabian peninsula can be generally distinguished from those of Syria, Iraq, Palestine and Transjordan, yet linguistically, culturally, economically, the Arabs of those former Ottoman provinces are one people. In spite of the fact that during the past twenty years they have been divided into several different States and that diverse laws have been introduced into these States, yet, owing to the improvement in communica tions and education, they are culturally as close together as they have been for centuries. (This sameness particularly applies to the Ottoman territories lying on the south-eastern coast of the Mediterranean. Syria formed one compact Arab area, of which Palestine, the Lebanon and Transjordan were parts not distinguish able from each other nor from the present truncated State of Syria.) These areas, including Iraq, were all part of the territories of the Ottoman Empire, no inter national botmdaries divhteflU&amp;Uem, the form of administration was the same, and &gt; Vthe same law applied. The habits and customs of the inhabitants in these areas were the same, whether they were Muslim or Christian, as, indeed, were their food and their general outlook. Although in Syt'ia and Palestine considerable numbers of Christians are to be found, they are mainly Arab in origin, and their customs, their language, their way of life are much the same as those of their Moslem neighbours. In the past ^4he Christian denominations have frequently been more hostile towards each eher than towards the Moslems, who treated all denominations alike. The only Christian community which had a special position was that of the Maronites. In 1864, following disturbances between the Maronites and the Druzes of the Lebanon, this province was “ placed under a privileged regime based on a large measure of autonomy which allowed the Maronites to have their own system of local government under a Christian Governor.' This special form of administration rested on an international guarantee. As under the old Ottoman Empire there existed various “ Millets ' with special rights, the idea of semi-autonomous communities within the State is familiar to all Arabs of the succession States and generally accepted as a fair and sensible policy. This privileged regime of the Maronites deserves careful study, as it can be the model for a semi-autonomous Jewish province in Palestine, as will be explained later. These Arabs of the Near and Middle East have for nearly a century been struggling to secure their natural right to independence, so that they may be able to unite; to recreate their ancient glory and to progress in the path of civilisation in freedom and peace. But, so far, political factors, external rather than internal, have obstructed their way and stood between them and their legitimate goal. When the Arabs lost their independence several centuries ago, some of their countries fell to the Ottoman Empire and others were later seized by European countries and treated as colonies. Yet all this did not destroy the idea of indepen dence in the Arab mind. Although Arab aspirations were suppressed for many years, the desire for independence eventually revived, stronger and mightier than ever. In the Ottoman Empire Arabs as Moslems were regarded as partners of the Turks. They shared with the Turks both rights and responsibilities without any racial distinctions. The higher appointments in the State, whether military or civil, were open to the Arabs; they were represented in both the Upper and the Lower Houses of the Ottoman Parliament. Many Arabs became Prime Ministers. Sheikhs al Islam, generals and Walis, and Arabs were always to be found in all ranks of the State services. • When the decline of the Ottoman Empire began and the Party of Union and Progress started the Pan-Turkish Movement, the Arabs preferred to separate from that Empire; they launched a campaign for the defence of their rights, thereby paving the way for the independence of their countries. At the beginning of the first Great War in 1914 the Arabs realised that a gloomy future awaited them owing to the sinister behaviour of the Party of Union and Progress, which had thrown itself into the arms of the Germans and joined them in the war against the Allies. So King Husain bin ’Ali (who was then the Sharif and Prince of Mecca) approached Great Britain, who definitely pledged herself to secure for the Arabs their independence. Relying on those promises, King Husain proclaimed in 1916 the separation of the Arabs from the Ottoman Empire and joined the Allies, who were then pressing through the most critical and dangerous stage of the war. The Arabs in all their countries welcomed the step taken by King Husain and supported him, in the hope that they would find in the pledges of the Allies the realisation of their national aspirations. In consequence, Arabs in Turkish territory were subjected to indescribable persecution and atrocities. But they fought the Turks on the side of the Allies and shared in the conquest of Palestine and Syria. In spite of the doubts raised in their minds when the Turks made public the terms of the secret Sykes-Picot Agreement and when the Balfour Declaration was published, the Arabs continued to trust in the repeated pledges given by Great Britain to King Husain and to the Arabs of Syria and Iraq generally, in various proclamations, that ‘ ‘ the future government of these territories should be based on the principle of the consent of the governed.” This confidence became a certainty in Arab minds when, in his famous Fourteen Points, President Wilson laid down that: £&lt; The Turkish portions of the present Ottoman Empire should be secured a sure sovereignty, but the other nationalities which are now under Turkish rule should be assured an undoubted security of life and an absolutely unmolested opportunity of autonomous development.”But the Arabs were gravely disappointed after the war, which ended with victory for the Allies, with whom they had joined and with whom they had fought, relying on their pledges to secure Arab independence. At the Peace Conference the Arabs realised that their victorious Allies had gone back on their promises. In fact, the treatment which the Arabs received from their Allies was worse than that accorded to the vanquished, who were not placed under any form of tutelage. The Allies divided the Arab territory amongst themselves according to secret, treaties granting themselves mandates over these regions, in spite of the strontf^ protests of all Arab leaders. These mandates were harder for the Arabs to bear than the old Ottoman rule. The mandatory system broke up the Arab territories into a number of separate administrations and was an arrangement which, if persisted in, would destroy Arab unity for ever. Iraq was placed under Great Britain, as was Southern Syria, and Northern Syria was handed over to France. Only the Arab States of the Arabian Peninsula were allowed complete independence. During the last twenty years the Arabs have tried in every way to attract the attention of the civilised world to the wrong that has been done to them; they have constantly endeavoured to persuade world opinion of the justice of their cause and have struggled incessantly to obtain their independence. This mandatory system adopted by the Allies of the last Great War was obnoxious to the freedom-loving Arabs, who resent any form of tutelage. It has been the cause of all the disturbances, rebellions, boycotts and ill-will which have existed in these Arab countries and which still threaten their peace. Iraq. Iraq had been a mandated territory till 1932. when, by the exertions of her own people and aided by the British Government, she obtained her independence and was admitted to the League of Nations in the same year. Ever since her independence, Iraq has been chiefly interested in her own affairs, following the path of development and advancement which can be seen in all the fields of her activities. She is bound to Great Britain by the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of Alliance of 1930 under the terms of which both States co-operate with complete under standing to the mutual benefit of both parties. Iraq is not merely a neighbour of other Arab countries, she is closely connected to them by the strongest linguistic, racial, religious, cultural, economical and other ties. In addition, Iraq shares with her neighbouring Arab countries the ideal of Arab unity which it is ultimately hoped will be realised. Without such union the Arabs will never be able to have their proper place in the world and regain their past glory, of which they are so rightly proud. Iraqis believe that such an Arab union can only be effected by securing true independence for all Arab countries, which, in the course of time, will make their choice as to the nature of the union which suits them best and fully guarantees their interests. These considerations have made Iraqis always respond to happenings in the neighbouring sister Arab countries and take an intense interest in them. Whatever happens in Syria or Palestine has some repercussion in Iraq. Although for centuries the Jews enjoyed complete liberty in Iraq and lived on excellent terms with their Moslem neighbours, yet violent anti-Jewish feeling has been aroused by the events in Palestine. This hostility has been fanned by German radio propaganda. As a result, in 1941, when an interregnum existed in Iraq and the forces of law and order were out of hand the mob looted the peaceful non-Zionist Jews of Bagdad and murdered a number of them. For this reason responsible statesmen in the Arab States where large Jewish communities are residing are always apprehensive of the effect in their own countries of what happens in Palestine. This also applies to all that occurs in the non-independent Arab regions. Northern Syria: the present mandated territories of Syria and the Lebanon. This was the most advanced of all the Arab provinces. The Syrians were the first to begin the Arab National Movement for independence. American and French universities and schools have been propagating learning and ideas of freedom among Arabs in Syria for over eighty years. In consequence Syria not only has a very numerous highly educated and cultured class of lawyers, doctors and arts graduates, but has a population with a highly-developed political spirit. In spite of the fact that Syria and the Lebanon are not less civilised than many European countries, the unsound mandatory system which has been imposed upon tlhem has impoverished them and created dissension among their peoples, leading to frequent disturbances and disorder. The Syrian Arabs have seizedo every opportunity to win true independence and even sacrificed their desire for unity in order to obtain it. They made agreements with the hrench tor their country to be divided into two States—the Lebanon and Syria. Unfortunately they have been informed by a recent official announcement that, after about twenty-five years of waiting for freedom, their countries are still to remain part of the French Empire. At the time of this declaration the French were lying under the yoke of nazism, and their Governments, both central and colonial, were supporting the Nazis wholeheartedly. The Arabs cannot believe that this decision will be upheld by the United Nations. Southern Syria: now divided into two mandated territories as Palestine and Transjordan. The rivalry of Britain and France has separated these two countries, which are British mandated territories, from Syria, of which they form an integral part. Transjordan enjoys a form of autonomy under the rule of His Royal Highness Prince Abdullah, son of King Husain, but is as anxious to obtain full independence as any of the other Arab countries. Of all the various problems facing the Arab countries, that of Palestine is the most difficult and calls for most serious attention, because the policy hitherto followed has resulted in obvious injustice to its original inhabitants, the Arabs, who still constitute two-thirds of the population. The Arabs of Palestine want to live independent in their own country, but the Zionist policy aims at wresting the land from the hands of its legitimate owners in order to transform it into a Jewish State. The Arabs do not hate the Jews, but they abhor the Zionist policy, which aims at the annexation of their country. The Zionist Movement is backed by unlimited funds, powerful institutions and political parties, as well as by distinguished personalities of great influence in Great Britain and America, while the Arabs of Palestine can only rely on the justice of their cause and their own exertions. Although the Arabs of Palestine have the moral support of Arabs in all neighbouring countries, these countries have been powerless to help them, materially or militarily, owing to their alliances in force or contemplated with Great Britain or France. Moreover, the Arab States want a peaceful settlement by agreement not by force. The Arabs from the very beginning believed that the pledges that Great Britain gave to the late King Husain (both when he was Sharif of Mecca and later when he was King of the Hejaz) included Palestine, Transjordan and most of Syria. The declaration stated :— “ That, subject to certain modifications (which excluded Mersin, Alexandretta and portions of Syria lying to the west of Damascus, Homs, Hama and Aleppo), Great Britain is prepared to recognise and uphold the independence of the Arabs in all the regions lying within the frontiers proposed by the Sharif of Mecca.” The British Government has never seriously challenged the Arab contention that Palestine was included in this pledge conveyed through Sir Henry McMahon in 1915. (The full text of the correspondence is attached to this note.) The Balfour Declaration was made subsequent to this definite pledge, and, when its contents alarmed the Arabs, the British Government sent a special envoy, Commander Hogarth, to set the doubts of King Husain at rest. King Husain was assured that ‘ ‘ Jewish settlement in Palestine would only be allowed in so far as would be consistent with the political and economic freedom of the Arab population.” While the terms of the Palestine Mandate give special rights to the Jewish Agency and Jewish settlers in Palestine, it nowhere lays down that the Jews are to have a Jewish State in Palestine. (The Arabs, of course, have never accepted the mandate as legal or binding on them, and in the mandate they are not even mentioned by name.) In successive Statements of Policy, published as White Papers, His Majesty’s Government has in 1922, 1930 and 1939 declared that: “ It is not part of British policy that Palestine should become a Jewish State.” When Great Britain accepted the mandate for Palestine, her first concern was to facilitate the creation of a Jewish National Home by assisting the Jewish Agency and other Jews to purchase land and arrange the peaceful transfer of the Arab cultivators of such land. She also endeavoured to secure Arab goodwill for the Jewish National Home. The mandatory was also occupied in establishing efficient administration and essential public services. [39—39] cSo for many years she made no serious effort to carry out the duty imposed upon her of assisting the inhabitants of Palestine to advance towards self- government. Unfortunately, when she eventually did consider how best to execute this part of her task, Arab fears of ultimate Jewish dominance and hostility to the mandate had become so intense that it was impossible to secure their co-opera tion in any proposed legislative or other assembly which might have paved the way for self-government. In 1937 Mr. Ormsby-Gore, then Secretary of State for the Colonies, told the Permanent Mandates Commission in the clearest possible terms “ that, in the absence of a radical change in the political relations, it would not he possible to carry on (the government of Palestine) except by methods of continuous military repression. The fact was that in Palestine the vast majority of the population was hostile to the mandatory Power and to the mandate. The loyalty of the Arabs was not directed towards Great Britain, the mandatory Power, but to the Arab race and the Arab ideal.” At this meeting the Secretary of State reiterated this view: “The mandatory told the Mandates Commission—as it would tell the Council later—that they were convinced of the necessity of political changes ” ; and again : “It was his definite opinion that, once the Arabs of Palestine (fired as they were with political hostility both to the mandatory Power and to the Jews) were given self-government, it would be to their interest to maintain security . . . As a result His Majesty’s Government recommended the partition of Palestine into three States—a Jewish State, an Arab State and a British- mandated area. Upon careful examination by a special Boundary Commission the partition of Palestine into separate States was found to be impractical. But this commission did not examine the possibility of creating a Jewish enclave or enclaves, with special rights on the Maronite model, inside a Palestinian State or a greater Arab State which would include Syria and Transjordan. The creating of two or more completely independent States out of the small territories of Palestine would have involved the creation of complex artificial boundaries with numerous pockets of Jews in the Arab State and vice versa, it would have meant the creation of at least one international corridor and possibly more. But if all Palestine were included in one Syrian State, the boundaries of the Jewish enclaves would he administrative boundaries only. The Jewish areas might consist of a number of qadhas or even nahiyas in which the Jews would enjoy special rights : alternatively, by arrangement with all parties a definite consolidated area could be assigned to the Jews for semi-autonomous administra tion, and Arabs settled within it would have to accept to live under the special regime or could be found land elsewhere. However, the partition of Palestine into two independent States and a mandated area, which had pleased nobody, was declared impossible, and the final policy of Great Britain was made public in 1939 after the Palestine Conference had broken down. In the latest White Paper of 1939 His Majesty’s Government declared that— “ (1) The objective of His Majesty’s Government is the establishment within ten years of an independent Palestine State in treaty relations with Great Britain .... “(2) The independent State should be one in which Arabs and Jews share in government in such a way as to ensure that the essential interests of each community are safeguarded.” The White Paper of 1939, in effect, limited the Jewish National Home in Palestine to the Jewish communities then resident in Palestine, plus 75,000 Jews who were to be allowed to settle in Palestine during the five years 1939-44. This meant that the Jews in Palestine would in 1944 constitute about a third of the population and that they would remain a permanent minority. His Majesty’s Government therefore considered that by 1944 her pledge in the Balfour Declaration would have been fulfilled and a Jewish National Home established in Palestine. All that remained was to establish self-government in Palestine in such a way as would best safeguard the rights of the Jews who had settled in Palestine under the terms of the Balfour Declaration. The detailed proposals put forward by His Majesty’s Government to reach this objective do not affect the underlying basis of the statement of policy : that Palestine had to be given self-government as soon as possible and that the Jews should be a permanent minority in this new State. The conference which met in London for the7 consideration of the Palestine question in 1939 was the first occasion on whic 1 Arab States were recognised by His Majesty’s Government as being mu ua y interested in the settlement of the Palestine problem. 1 he conference me m u delegates representing Egypt, Saudi Arabia. Yemen, Transjordan and Iraq, w o were invited because their States were interested in the future of I a lest me, i being an Arab territory and its administration and future development a nia er of common concern to all Arabs. . . . - In Arab eyes this invitation marked a return by Great Britain to the spin of her old pledges to King Husain which regarded all Arabs in the old Ottoman Empire as one community united by one ideal. This is my first justification loi raising these issues and making my suggestions at this time. It has to be admitted that conditions in all these Arab countries have remained unsettled ever since the end of the last Great War. Numerous rebellions have broken out causing much bloodshed and devastation in many pai ts of these Arab lands. Apart from this, the most law-abiding inhabitants of those countries have always been the victims of worry and anxiety about their own future and that of their compatriots during all these long years. In Palestine and Syria even the non-rebellious Arabs feel that they have not been allowed to develop their full civil and political rights. They have had no confidence m the ability of the mandatory regime to provide a permanent peaceful form of govern ment. They have had to live in territory too often subject to disorder to enable them to consider the future and prepare for it. As soon as the present war broke out the Axis Powers did not lose a moment in looking for weak points m the Allied position in the Arab countries and promptly exploited any weaknesses they were able tc discover. Elements of disorder and anarchy in all Arab countries were actively and unscrupulously supported, with the result that both the Arabs and the United Nations suffered severely. In spite of previous disillusionments the Arabs have welcomed the Atlantic Charter with satisfaction, because they consider it a guarantee for the realisation of their national aspirations which will be united in the way they choose of their own free will. We feel that the British Government regards the Arabs’ claims with sympathy and that they are ready to solve the problem of the Arab countries in the same satisfactory manner as they solved those of Iraq. If they succeed in putting these sympathetic intentions into effect, the present chaotic state of the Arab countries will come to an end to the benefit of the interests of Great Britain as well as to the Arab countries themselves. We realise that the British Government has not a free hand in dealing with these problems, because their action is subject to the concurrence of their Allies. But now that the United States are co-operating so fully with Great Britain the hands of the latter are freer and we feel that it will be possible for her to reconsider her whole policy towards all Arabs. All Arabs and particularly those of the Near and Middle East have, deep down in their hearts, the feeling that they are “ members one of another ” Their “ nationalism” springs from the Moslem feeling of brotherhood enjoined on them by the Prophet Muhammad in his last public speech. It differs therefore from a great deal of European nationalism and patriotism. Although Arabs are naturallv attached to their native land, their nationalism is not confined by boundaries. It is an aspiration to restore the great tolerant civilisation of the early Caliphate. We therefore believe that any policy which satisfies the legitimate political rights and aspirations of the Arabs will restore peace to the Arab countries and that such peace and contentment will be of invaluable service in promoting the interests of the United Nations in this grave period of war. Moreover, such a policy will put an end to the Axis intrigues in the Arab countries and stop the flood of Axis propaganda which finds there a most fertile soil for sowing its evil seeds, owing to the discontent of the Arabs with their present situation and their anxiety about their future. The events of the past few years have revealed the weakness of very small States. It is generally assumed that after the war the peace settlement will endeavour to group the smaller States together in some form of regional leagues or alliances which can be sufficiently powerful to protect all the members from aggression. While I realise that many years must elapse before the Arab States can stand completely alone, yet. even their allies among the Great Powers will probably demand that they make a greater contribution to their own defence services. Therefore the old idea of creating an independent Palestine and an [39—39] Dindependent Lebanon and Syria must be abandoned and a new solution considered. , Great Britain and France have repeatedly declared that they agree to tne future independence of each of these parts of historical Syria. If independence is admitted to he the right of the peoples living in these areas, they must, t'pso facto, have the right to coalesce in a unitary State or join together in a league or confederation, if experience has proved that very small States cannot adequately defend themselves and that they constitute a danger to their neighbours and tq the peace of the world, then union or federation can justly be imposed on them ir these separate States really form one community, linguistically, culturally and economically. Paragraph 4 of article 22 of the Covenant of the League of Nations reads as follows :— “ Certain communities formerly belonging to the Turkish Empire have reached a stage of development when their existence as independent nations can be provisionally recognised subject to the rendering of administrative advice and assistance by a mandatory until such time as they are able to stand alone ” Doubts have been expressed at various times as to whether Palestine came within the ambit of this paragraph. But Mr. Malcolm MacDonald told the Mandate Commission of the League of Nations in 1939 that the Arabs of Palestine could not be regarded as so utterly different from the Arabs of Iraq or Syria that rights which clearly belonged to the latter under paragraph 4 should be completely denied to their fellow-Arabs in Palestine.' This statement goes to the root of the whole problem. The Arab contention is that all the Moslems, Christians, Jews and Druzes who occupy the Lebanon, Syria, Transjordan and Palestine are one community not differing very greatly from the inhabitants of Iraq. In 1918 this community was better educated than the Iraq is and more acquainted with and tolerant of modern, centralised, bureaucratic administration. . . The Permanent Mandates Commission of the League of Nations decided in June 1939 that the proposal of His Majesty’s Government to set up in Palestine an Arab State in which the Jews would form a minority was contrary to the interpretation which had always been placed upon the Palestine Mandate. In commenting on this decision His Majesty’s Government pointed out that it had been found impracticable to form both an independent Arab State and an independent Jewish State in Palestine but that one of the possibilities yhich the mandatory Power had m view is the establishment of a federal constitution. Now Palestine is a very small territory with a population of less than 2 million souls. To create federal constitution for such a small country would be difficult and cumbersome. But if Palestine reverts to its proper place as part of the historical Syria it should be possible to create for Syria, Lebanon, Palestine and Transjordan either a unitary State or a federal constitution which would work efficiently. . , • , , * , . 0 , If the Palestinian Arabs could be reunited with the Arabs of Syria and Transjordan they would not be so apprehensive of Jewish expansion, and the Jewish communities now in Palestine would feel safer and more settled. They could be allowed a considerable degree of local autonomy .under some form of international guarantee, if that is considered necessary. In the very protracted and frank discussions which took place between Mr Malcolm MacDonald and the Permanent Mandates Commission in June 1939 the point was raised again and again that there must be a spirit of evolution in the consideration of specific pledges and promises. While in no way denying the validity of the various pledges and promises given by His Majesty Govern ment to various communities, Mr. Malcolm MacDonald felt that these pledges and promises had to be reinterpreted from time to time in the light of the development, both political and economic, that had occurred in Palestine since the pledges were first given i 10 r Such reconsideration is, indeed, specifically provided for in article 19 of the Covenant of the league of Nations which lays down that “ The Assembly may from time to time advise the reconsideration by members of the League of treaties which have become inapplicable and the consideration of international conditions whose continuance might endanger the peace of the world.” This is another justification for recommending the re-examination of the whole position of the Arab States of the Near and Middle East.9 15^ t * t *- * In Iraq, whose population in 1918 was more backward politically and educationally than that of Syria and Palestine, it has been shown that an independent native State can function with the minimum of advice and support from its ally. In Saudi Arabia, His Majesty Ibn Saud has shown that an Arab ruler can maintain peace and order over nomad Bedouin occupying vast stretches of desert and over settled Arabs in towns and oasis and considerably develop their resources. ''The discovery of oil in Arab countries has given them economic resources and revenue not hitherto available. Iraq needs an outlet to the Mediterranean for its oil and other r products. Palestine, which is being rapidly industrialised, needs markets for its products and oil fuel for its factories. These are facts which have to be taken into account and which justify a re-exa^nination of the pledges given by His Majesty’s Government, some of which were embodied in the mandates of the League of Nations. These present factors call for a new policy altogether, which will settle permanently the future of the inhabitants of the Near and Middle East. My proposals which follow are based on the close relations which already exist between Iraq and all the Arabs of historic Syria. The States of the Arabian peninsula, although so near to us in language, custom and religion, have a different economy. Egypt has a larger population than the Succession States and has her own problems in the Sudan and elsewhere. I have therefore assumed that these States will not at first be inclined to join an Arab Federation or League, though, if such a union succeeded between Iraq and Syria, there is every likelihood that they would in time wish to join it. But from the very beginning I anticipate that such a League, even if limited to Iraq and Syria, would facilitate joint consultation between, and action by, all Arab States whether within the League or not. Many of our problems are the same; we are all part of one civilisation; we generally think along the same lines and we are all animated by the same ideals of freedom of conscience, liberty of speech, equality before the law and the basic brotherhood of mankind. Conclusion. In my view the only fair solution, and indeed the only hope of securing permanent peace, contentment and progress in these Arab areas is for the United Nations to declare now :— (1) That Syria, Lebanon, Palestine and Transjordan shall be reunited into one State. (2) That the form of government of this State, whether monarchical or republican, whether unitary or federal, shall be decided by the peoples of this country themselves. (3) That there shall be created an Arab League to which Iraq and Syria will adhere at once and which can be joined by the other Arab States at will. (4) That this Arab League shall have a permanent council nominated by the member States, and presided over by one of the rulers of the States, who shall be chosen in a manner acceptable to the States concerned. (5) The Arab League Council shall be responsible for the following :— (a) Defence. (b) Foreign affairs. (c) Currency. (d) Communications. \e) Customs. (/) Protection of minority rights. (6) The Jews in Palestine shall be given semi-autonomy. They shall have the right to their own rural and urban district administration, including schools, health institutes and policy, subject to general supervision by the Syrian State. (7) Jerusalem shall be a city to which members of all religions shall have free access for pilgrimage and worship and a special commission composed of representatives of the three theocratic religions shall be set up to ensure this. (8) That, if they demand it, the Maronites in the Lebanon shall be granted a privileged regime, such as they possessed during the last years of the Ottoman Empire. This special regime, like those to be set up in paragraphs 6 and 7 above, shall rest on an International Guarantee.If it is possible in the manner suggested above to create a Coniedeiation o Arab States, including Iraq, Syria, Palestine and r i ransjordan at the beginning, to which other Arab States may later adhere, then a great many of the dimculties which have faced Great Britain and I ranee in the Near hast during the pas wo decades will disappear. The Arabs of Palestine at present tear that they will become a minority in a Jewish State, and therefore bitterly oppose the grant o special rights to the Jews, but this, hostility would be allayed if Palestine became part of a large strong Arab State. The Jews could establish their National Homcj^v m those parts of Palestine where they are now the majority with a greater t eel mg of security, because there would be more goodwill on the part ot their Aral) neigh bours, and as a semi-autonomous community in a much larger State their economic opportunities would increase. • • • j i * t? The British Empire is not founded on negations, but on positive ideals, rree institutions and free co-operation give it a living force ol tremendous strength. Upon this foundation of free co-operation a true union of many diverse peoples and countries has been formed, depending less upon stipulations and statistics and more upon the nobler and more permanent principles which are written on the heart and conscience of man. If an opportunity is given to the Arab peoples to establish such a free co-operation among themselves they wdl be prepared to deal generously with all the Jews living in their midst, whether in Palestine or elsewhere. Conditions and guarantees there must be, but let them not constitute a dead hand, lest they become a dead letter, as so many minority provisions m European Constitutions became during the past twenty years. If my proposals meet with favour they will require a careful examination, so that the appropriate steps are taken at the right time and in the right order. Obviously, the union of the various parts of historic Syria must come first. It may at first take the form of a federation of Syria, Lebanon, Palestine and Tians iordan, each State continuing its own local administration, leaving defence, foreign relations, currency and customs to the Central Government. On the other hand*! it may be found possible to unite Syria at once, making provision for the Jewish enclaves and the Jerusalem administration at the same time. Steps should be taken at once to define these enclaves, and for this purpose it would be necessary to prepare an accurate ethnographical map of Palestine, showing the number of Arabs and Jews in each nahya and town, also a map on the same scale showing the land under cultivation and the land which can be cultivated intensely m the I future. An enquiry should also be made as to the number of Jews who have /settled in Palestine since the outbreak of the war in September 1939. To secure Arab union sacrifices of sovereignty and vested interests may have to be made. Similar sacrifices have been made in the British Dominions and can be equally demanded from Arab leaders. I have throughout assumed that as France before the war declared that she was prepared to grant independence to Syria and the Lebanon she will not be allowed by the United Nations to repudiate her offers, nor to obstruct any federation of Arab States by insisting on old privileges or antiquated rights.[This_telegram is of particular secrecy and should be retained by the authorised recipient and not passed on.] [CYPHER] W AR CABINET DISTRIBUTIO N.

WWW My telegram No.75 paragraph 10. I have now completed my studies of Prime Minis ter s letter to Minister of State. It begins with protest against current Zionist propaganda, goes on to review the history of Syria, Palestine and Iraq since the last war and concludes with advocating immediate declaration by the United Nations that Syria, Lebanon Palestine and Transjordan shall be united into one state and^that there should be created an Arab League to which the above united states and Iraq shall adhere at once and others shall join at will. 2. Minister of State will no doubt wish to comment in detail on various points made by Nuri Pasha and I^am therefore reluctant to say more than that although it contains some useful and constructive material, it also unhappily includes number of | inaccurate and sometimes ungenerous statements, ^w f hich alienate the reader's sympathy. It also fails to take into account practical difficulties when making final recommendations. As the Prime Minister is having 300 copies printed for private circulation, its contents are certainly becoming widely known among Arab politicians in all countries, and I foresee that it will become document of considerable importance. A good deal of it is I think based on speech which Nuri Pasha made at London Conference in 1939 but new and rather menacing feature is his v/arning that unless Zionists and their sympathisers cease propa ganda during the war it will be very difficult for Arab leaders to restrain the less responsible Arabs from resuming propaganda themselves. Were this to occur it would have profoundly unsett ling effect here and no doubt throughout the Middle East and the threat should in my opinion be taken seriously.

Once let it be thought he was following a policy dictated by the British, his influence with the Moslem would go, and he would give Axis propaganda a stick with which to beat him, 3, He told me that whilst he would do all he could to help His Majesty 5 s Government, short of going to war, he must do nothing to cause provocation, firstly because he would be offering the enemy an excuse for air attack on him and secondly, because his present strong position vis-d-vis his own people and especially Hejazis was due to the fact that the policy he had pursued had resulted iri the country being kept clear of war* 4, The fact, he added,* that he had rid us of Italians and had allowed the press (especially Iraqi press) to say without a dementi from' him, that he had expelled them because of his love of democracies, was sure enough indication to His Majesty’s Government and others, where his sympathies lay, 5, I feel Ibn Saud is right, and I should deprecate an approach to him by Nahas Pasha direct or through His Majesty's Government”.

It seems doubtful whether the Governments of the Independent Arab States^would find it easy to agree on terms o an abstract declaration in favour of the democracies and question of whether specifically applied principles of democracy offer any assurance of realisation of Arab hopes would prcoably come up if Egyptian Prime Minister were to act as he suggests.

On this last point the Prime Minister had had a conversation with General Catroux during the latters 1 recent visit to Cairo and had found the General receptive on the subject of more representative Governments in these two States. 2. Nahas Pasha r s idea appears to be that he should point out to the Arab States the disadvantages they had to expect from Axis domination and the advantages from co-operation with the democracies. 5.

From the more exclusively Indian angle it is impossible to ignore considerations such as the potential effect on Muslim India of any initiative which H.M.G. might take to promote Arab Federation. We could not expect for instance that criticism offered by the Muslim League would be either informed or take account of India’s interests in the maintenance of stability in the Arab lands. Just as H.M.G.* s attitude to Turkey after the last war had to take account of re-actions in India,so must policy in the Middle East now and after the present war make allowance for Muslim opinion in India, and for this reason alone we should be strongly opposed to any attempt to lead political development in Arab countries of the Middle East, though admittedly spontaneous developments in these countries must be watched and, as far as possible, guided into innocuous channels. part tending to diminish the security of those tremendous assets.

The Committee’s report has now been completed and has been circulated to you by the ..sbinet Offices. As the next step, I think it would be useful if we were to have another meeting to consider the action to be taken on the report, and I suggest 3 o’clock on the 7th April, if that is convenient,^ paragraph 17 of the report contains the Committee’s recommendations regarding further action. The first two recommendations, (a) on economic cooperation, and (b) on cultural cooperation, seem to me to be on the right lines, and for convenience I .enclose drafts on the subject which eoull, if we are agreed, be addressed to the Minister of State. Recommendation (c) about the extension of the ’’Treaty ’•of Arab Brotherhood” I think rightly suggests that proposals should first be initiated by the countries concerned, and I doubt whether we should do more than encourage such proposals if made by the Arabs themselves. As regards recommendation (d), the Chiefs of Staff have agreed that post-war strategic questions can be studied by the Joint*Planning Staff. I think that these Middle Eastern problems might with advantage be examined by that body, and a draft to the Secretary of the Joint Planning Staff is attached, which we might also consider at cur meeting.

This recommendation was the conclusion reached on one of the preceding paragraphs of the Report, which ran as followss *It is important, in any case, that those responsible for British policy in the Middle last, if they are to endeavour to guide the movement on lines which are compatible with British interests, should bear in mind British strategic neede in the Arab States* Sssential British interests in the Middle East have been defined as coHimunications and oil. It la clear that we shall at least require to maintain those naval, military and those interests* These are all points which will call for ful? r&gt;nr\a -1 f i n t. fch* proper time”* Q&amp;The Toreign Office would be glad if the Joint Planning Staff could make a study of our post-war etrateglc requirements in the Arab States as soon as possible. They wieh» m o^r /er, to emphasise that, in their view, this is not vderely a post-war problem, but one of practical importance at the present time. Decisions on policy are constantly required, and in the absence of any authoritative statement of British strategic needs. It is not always easy to frame policy or to reach the correct conclusions on the problems which arise from day to day. 3. Conditions within the irab tates, as in other countries, are in fact liable both to gradual development and to sudden change, and British policy must always be prepared to take account of such development or change^ in order to safeguard or advance Britisu interests. For example, the grant of independence to Syria and the Lebanon, and the supersession (to that extent) of the French Mandate, has profoundly modified the situation throughout the Arab States. One result has already been that the Smir^ Abdullah of Transjordan has asked also to be accorded independence and to be relieved from the burden of the Mandate, and the British authorities in the Middle ,ast have recommended that we should now promise the mir to grant him this independence after the war. There is bound also to be ever*-increasing pressure on us from the Arabs to grant independence to Palestine and to abolish the Palestine Mandate, whereas the Zionists may similarly press for a final solution of the Palestine problem on lines favourable/favourable to their own aspirations. The question has thus already arisen what is to be the ooeition in Transjordan when independence has been granted and what, if any, are our strategic needs in that country; while the further question may arise at any time what is to be the future of Palestine, and what are our essential strategic needs in that country too. 4. Another contingency which we cannot afford to overlook entirely is the possibility that, when Ibn baud dies or loses his grip, his heirs may not be able to hold together the whole of the tribes and settled areas which he has made into the Kingfloin of Saudi Arabia, and there is even the possibility that the whole of Saudi Arabia may then relapse into a state of primitive lawlessness. e do not suggest that we need have a cut and dried plan ready for such an emergency. But here again it will be very important indeed to know what our essential strategic needs are in that part of the world. 5. Another strategic problem arises with regard to the Persian Gulf States. During the 19th century it was considered a matter of the utmost importancei largely on strategic grounds, that our paramount position in the Persian Gulf should be secured. This resulted in a series of treaties with local sheikhs, some of whom ruled only very small territories, whereby they engaged themselves to look solely to the British Government, and to refrain from having anything whatever to do with any other Power. No doubt our objective remains the same today, in regard to European lowers,for we could hardly allow a Buropean Power to establish military naval or air bases in these territories. But/^u^^jArab federations ie in the air t and even alt^jcgh it may not come to much for some tim** yet, there may eell be a tendency on the part of the Oulf Statea towards establishing closer relutione with other r,rab countries. This may in turn affect, the means by which we have up till now secured our objective, and it would be well to know now whether any amalgamation,or disappearance, of Oulf Sheikhdoms would be contrary to our essential strategic requirements. 6# A similar, but more general, question is to what extent it may be desirable for His Majesty’s Government to undertake military commitments for the defence of the Arab btatee, in order to exclude other Great Powers# 7# Another strategic problem arises from the tendency recently shown by the Turkish Government to demand territorial rectification of the Turco-byrian frontier. This raises political problems of great importance. There is also a strategic aspect, namely, the question whether, and if so to what extent, the grant of Turkish demands for complete control of the east-west railway through Syria, and for the town and district of Aleppo, would affect our own strategic position in Palestine, Transjordan or Iraq# 3. There Is also the extremely complicated question of our general interests in Syria and the Lebanon. This la, of course, the only part of the Arab World (except for Rorth Africa) where another European Power is already installed; and we are pledged that after the war the French shall retain th* predominant position here, in so far as any European Power is to have a predominant position. It may of course be that France will be incapable/incapable of aeeerting that position and it would be useful to know whether from a etrategic point of view it would suit ue better to aaeist France to do so, or not. In short* how far does the presence of the French in the Levant States help us strategically? Would it benefit us strategically if we could secure a military understanding with the French by which we would support French strategic needs in £yria and the Lebanon* and the French would in return support British strategic needs in neighbouring countries? 9. The Foreign Office would suggest, that the questions for consideration might be the following (although the proposed study of the whole problem may reveal other questions of equal importance which require an answer):- (a) What are the military, naval and air facilities which His Majesty’s Government will require in the Middle Eastern area as m whole? (It is suggested that the answer to this question should be drawn up on the assumption that it is likely to be politically impracticable to induce the Iraqi Government to agree to grant us more extensive facilities than those set forth in the existing Treaty of Alliance). (b) If Transjordan is to be granted independence* what facilities shall we require in order th*t our strategic requirements may be safeguarded in that country? (c) Similarly* what would our strategic requirements be in Palestine in the event of a change in the present regime in that country? (d) ^hat is the military importance of maintaining the British position in the Persian Gulf States and Southern Arabia in the face of •tty/? f ^^*«ndency ^riong Arab States to develop clo*dr relatione among themaelves? (e) To what extent may It be desirable for Hla Majesty’s Government to undertake military commit^nte, for the defence of the Arab ktateB t in order to exclude other Great Powers? (f) What would be the military implications of acceding to Turkish demands for Aleppo and other territorial concessions in Northern Syria. (g) Would Anglo-French cooperation in the Eastern Mediterranean be likely to possess any military advantages? 10. The ultimate object will of course be to frame a policy which will have to take account of political and other considerations, but that is a later stage. The first thing is to know what we should try to secure to suit our strategic requirements. And we should like to know not only what we should try to secure If circumstances are favourable, but also what we must have for our safety - i. a. our minim m strategic needs. 11. Finally, ae oil is one of the essential British interests in this area, I should draw your attention to the enclosed letter from the Petroleum Department, from which you will see that they wish to have a chance of submitting Tiheir views. I panwhile, 1 ©m sending them a copy of this letter,Petroleum Department* 7 f illllbanlc, London* 35rd February* 1942• My dear iiarold* In connection with the Report on Arab Federation, M.K.(u)(43)4* I hope that if and when it ia decided to proceed with recommendation 17(d), the Petroleum Department will be inforn*d, bo as to have an opportunity of submitting its views. This does not irqply any criticism of the Gounittec^ conclusions, with which we are in entire agreement; but oil is defined in paragraph 12 aa an essential British interest and I believe that the technical and supply aspects are inseparable from the political. It will probably also be necessary for the financial be taicen into consideration. There ia every likelihood that a lack of foreign exchange will persist after the war, and in this event it may well be rieceaaBry to increase proportionately our imports of oil from sterling sources. The Middle Hast ia* of course* our principal potential source of sterling oil. There is* moreover* another angle from which 1 feel this question should be approached. Gil is not only an essential British interest* but the chief economic asset of the Arab states of the Middle Kaat. Apart from the colossal reserves of Iraq and the important though small production of Bahrein and Gaudi Arabia, new fields have recently been discovered in Kuwait and ^at^r, while iiyria, Palestine and the Trucial Coast sheikhdoms are not without speculative possibilities. Perhaps/ H.A.Gaccis,bsq., Foreign Office* Downing street* M.tf.l.Perhaps the moment has not yet come to formulate a policy doaigned to Meet circumstances which have yet to become acute* It does seem to me» however» that seme planner the allocation or distribution of oil revenues will sooner or later become necessary* States which are small, weak and rich will always offer an irresistible prize to their hardier and hungrier neighbours, and nothing constructive can be gained by pouring into the pockets of minor rulers an income which is beyond the capacity of their peox^lo or territory to absorb* Surplus funds can at best only be accumulated as useless bullion, and are more likely to find their outlet in guns, decadence and intrique* I am afraid that this letter only emphasises difficulties without offering a solution, but I thought it might be worth while to put these points on record in case we can be of any assistance when the time la ripe for a more detailed discussion, since I cannot feel that an economic federation based purely on a form of customs union cun touch the core of the problem* Yours ever, (ad) Maurice Bridgeraano Ho- 3.i (CGP/33/2/42) Representative of India Middle East V/ar Council 10, Sharia Tolumbat CAIRO January 26, 194-2. iTextH a r~ Will you please refer to the papers en closed with your demi-offi cial letter No.48/S-dated Januar y ^ 1942^ regarding A.rab Federation. Before 'dealing with the position of the Persian Gulf States vis-a-vis such a scheme it will be convenient to consider the subject as a whole. 2. In my opinion a Federation of all the Arab States is at present impossible, and no serious move in this direction has yet been made by any of the protagonists. If we were to take up the matter our selves we should raise hopes which could not be ful filled, and since the attempt would be bound to fail — we should automatically be discredited by its non success, for which we should, moreover, be held respons ible. It appears from the correspondence that in this instance the move has no other source than the fertile brain of Hafiz V/ahba, and though it is a favourite hobby horse of Arab politicians there is nothing to ‘lU-'sro. show that any authoritative body among them is serious- ^ ly contemplating it any practical form. 3. Indeed, the obstacles militating against any close form of federation must appear insurmountable. The absence of any altruistic spirit, and the total lack of any desire to subordinate individual interests to the common weal (which must be the basis of any form of federation), the potential struggles for hegemony and the disparity of assets and culture - in fact the whole history of the Arab race - make any form of close association both unpalatable and unpractical. Once it was perceived by one partner, e.g. Iraq, that they would run the risk of having the quicker witted Syrian placed by a Federal authority in lucrative posts in their country, the proposal would lose all its glamour, and if it was fully realised that their armed forces might be expected to serve abroad in the interests of the other components they would be profoundly alarmed. Nor is language any sound base, for the spoken forms of Arabic differ widely and are so firmly grounded that^a^person speaking one variety is under a serious disability in other areas. 4. On the whole, I agree generally with the views expressed by Sir Kinahan Cornwallis in his d espatch No. ■ - ~ 282 m .K.Caroe, Esq., C.S.I., C.I.E., I.C.b., Secretary, External Affairs Department, New Delhi7 . As • • • 2 . / (r; 282 of October 4, 194-1? and his telegram 1179 dated October 15, 194-1? to the Torelgn Office, with the^ following exception. He contemplates that the initial experiment could be conveniently restricted to the adjacent territories of Iraq, Syria, Trans-Jordan and Palestine. I certainly agree that Syria, (with which I include for the purposes of this note the other components of the French mandate) Trans-Jordan and Palestine would be suitable subjects for an experiment since they were formerly portions of the same economic unit, and their separation has involved their inhabi tants in great hardship. The position of Iraq, however, is entirely different. Iraq has always been separated from Syria and both ethnologically and economically its interests have always been essentially divergent. The whole history of this area is one of prolonged rivalry from the Greeks and Persians to the Abbasid and Umaiyyid and this divergence of interest is now enhanced by the fact that Iraq is possessed of great mineral wealth and is on the way to becoming a second Egypt. Syria, Trans-Jordan and Palestine must remain ' in the nature of poor relations, and it is most un likely that Iraq will v/ish to share her growing riches .with them. On the other hand, as I have said above, there are no great difficulties apart from artificial political obstacles in bringing these three into closer relationship with each other. Su^ '■t ^ oukJ ticst eccrwmuc&lt;v^ CL U.K10VI . pyi/RL' P’ 5 . Our proper role is a simple one. We should keep abreast of any movement towards unity and facilitate as far as possible the removal of economic and administra tive barriers. I see a zollverein menti oned in _C airo_ ^ te legram ^221 of 0ctob er-14^-a941; to thT Foreign Office. f I lioubt very much whether the removal of customs barriers between the whole area is practical politics within any reasonable space of time, since it is inconceivable that j Egypt would be prepared to share her wealth Y/ith the |other Arab nations. On the other hand, although cultural barriers can be more easily raised, the main difficulty will lie in the intellectually important area where the population are accustomed to and based on the French cultural connection. Since any attempt at closer cultural union will almost inevitably loosen the links #iich bind them to France this will be bitterly opposed and we have everything to gain by remaining aloof from this struggle. The means and the methods of severing the French cultural connection will have to be found by the Arabs themselves. 6. It is interesting to see the problem through Arab eyes and in this connection I enclose a cutting from the 'Egyptian Mail' of January 21. It will be seen that what is contemplated here is a conference between representatives of radio stations to study collaboration and also between educational experts to discuss unification of studies. It is doubtful whether broadcasting will provide a\ very fruitful field for co operation, and it is probably in the educational sphere that most progress will be found practicable. I suggest that some form of postal and perhaps telegraphic inter- ccynmunication at reduced rates might also form a useful contribution on the lines of the Empire penny post of happier days. This should not be difficult to achieve and would have a practical value in facilitating communication between people of the same linguistic interests.7. As regards the position of the Arab States in the Persian Gulf, all the disadvantages of a federa tion apply to them with greater force and the advantages appear less attractive; in other words they have less to gain and more to lose. Any form of zollverein or unified customs control would cost them a large propor tion of their customs revenues, since this would presum ably be allocated on a population basis. Again, there is little doubt that the other members of a powerful federation would expect Bahrain, Kuwait and Qatar to pass on to tiem a large portion of the oil royalties which they now enjoy, if only on the plea of providing for their defence. Finally, their distance from the centre, their paucity in numbers and their relatively backward condi tion would make it obvious that they could carry little weight in any organized body of Arabs and they would have little say in a federation to v:hich they would, how ever, be expected to make very substantial contributions. 8. From the Imperial point of view, the advantages of a federation to the Persian Gulf are even less obvious. There is little doubt that any form of greater unity amongst Arabs would carry as a necessary corollary a^ closer front against non-Arab interests. We should in evitably find the discrimination against Indians which exists already in Iraq and which was responsible for their being ejected as soon as the mandate terminated extended to the Gulf States, and, though its climate would help to deter a Syrian or Palestinian invasion on any scale, there is little doubt that the Nejdis would be only too delighted to use the slogan 'Arabia for the Arabs' to expropriate the businesses of their Indian competitors. 9. Our Imperial interests in these States are so vital that we cannot afford to encourage them to turn away from us. The security of the air routes, our naval base, the new r oil fields that are being discovered and developed all point to the fact that these States should be encouraged to look to us and to no one else. Even the instance of postal and telegraph communications which I mentioned above would, if taken to its logical conclusion, i.e. a Federal Post and Telegraph Service, hit our control over post offices in this area which is very valuable to us and injure our cable communications. Now that the Red bear has tasted the Persian honey he may well prove 1 reluctant to return to his Caucasian mountains, in fact I it is almost a foregone conclusion that he will find \ some means of remaining in this Naboths vineyard. Since the Russians have found their strength this may well lead to a great extension of their influence and as a con comitant a waning of ours. The more our position on the Persian coast v/eakens, the more valuable our links on the Arab shore become. We should therefore do all w r e can to preserve and strengthen them. 10. I see that the proposals have been alluded to throughout the correspondence as a Federation of Arab States, and I have therefore continued to use this term. Actually what is contemplated is a Confederation and not a Federation, for while a Federation means a Union of States in which the accent is laid on the supremacy of the common government, (which is a chimera so far as the Arab w'orld is concerned), a Confederation implies a Union of Sovereign States in which the stress is laid on ...4 on the sovereign independence of each constituer J body. It is clearly this type of Union alone that is in any way suited to the conditions we have in mind. 11. To sum up. Since we cannot oppose a confedera tion of Arab States, we should keep abreast of the move ment and give it our blessing. We should confine our active assistance to the removal of economic and administrative barriers, and lose no opportunity of uiding the movement into innocuous channels. We should nobtrusively discourage the Persian Gulf States from taking any part in the movement, and encourage them at all times to look to us and not to the Arabian Peninsula for their salvation. 12.

Professor Makdeshi suggested that there should be a conference of representatives from Arabic radio stations to study collabora tion, and, secondly, another conference be tween representatives of educational administra tions from the Arab countries to discuss the unification of studies. Professor Makdeshi also declared that the development of educational collaboration could not be attained unless economic restric tions were lifted and freedom of thoughfexisted. 'Our allies,' he added, 'have the qualities which can produce these conditions by helping the Arab countries to break down the barriers between them, strengthening the feeling of brotherhood and teaching them to live in the established political regine with a confident feeling that there is justice and collaboration^' A.N.A. •* « 0 •/ith the compliment b of Mr, G» Syers v &gt; \^ TRfiASUHY CHAMBERS, S.W.l.

Discussions anc consultations had since taken place hetween the two Departments as a result of which he had reached the conclusion that the he£ M.E.(o)(4l) 5th Meeting Minutes, Conclusion (a).and most expeditious plan would Idg to prepare the draft of a formal report for ciroulation to the Conmittee as a basis of discussion* The report took account of the views which had been expressed by the British Representatives in several of the Arab countries concerned. It was to a large extent negative in its conclusions. This might be a matter for regret, but the logic of circumstances was inexorable# It was clear from all the evidence obtainable that Arab Federation on political lines lay outside the practical politics of the moment, and that there was small hope in this direction of finding a solution for the problem of Palestine# THE COMMITTEE proceeded to consider the draft report and the following were the main points made:- (i) Referring to paragraphs 12 and IT'(d), COLONEL SPRAGGETT said that at the last Meeting of the Committee the Service Representatives had stated what were the essential British . . - ’ strategic interests in the Middle East# He did not think it was possible to carry consideration of this question further as eo much would depend on the military position after the war. (ii) MR, BAXTER said'that we ought to have some idea of what our post-war policy would be* Clearly we should have to safeguard oil supplies and communicatibhs.' Moreover it was to be anticipated that the Arab States would draw closer together# In these circumstances, from the politico- strategic point of View could we not determine now such questions, as,.for exemple, whether it was necessary, to ; prevent the Sheikh of Koweit and the Trueial 'sheikhs from turning towards some central tendency on strategic grounds, Were these grounds still valid? Again if it was clear that • we required a naval base at Haifa, it might be well to consider the question of the area in the neighbourhood of the base which would be needed for jits protection;, either from the-air, or-on the ground* • ■.; : &gt; ■ ■ (iii) MAJOR KIRWAN. oq ,the behalf .of the War Office expressed agreement with Colonel Spraggett but raised the question whether the Joint Planning Staff might not:be invited to say now ‘What our future, requirements were likely to be* ' Lv. ::0 ■. (iv) GROUP CAPTAIN LONG on behalf of .the Air Ministry expressed agreement .with Colonel Spraggett. He considered that it was essential that our present policy should be to keep such degree of control now as to ensure that after the war our minimum strategic requirements would be met. After further discussion it was agreed that the Admiralty Representative should prepare, in consultation with the Foreign Office and with the other Service Departments, a revised draft of paragraphs 12 and 17 (d) of : the Report taking into account the points made in the discussion; and that the revised text of these paragraphs, as agreed by the Departments concerned, should be communicated to the Secretary as soon as possible. -2-'-3- k Great Subject to the revision of the two paragraphs, and to a certain number of minor amendments mainly of a verbal character, the draft Report was adopted by the Comanittee# In conclusion, the Chairman raised the question of procedure in presenting the Committee’s report. In the past the Committee had been a sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence to which its reports had naturally been submitted. Now that the C.I.D. had coaoed to exist, its former Sub-Committee was left rather in the air. In the present case the invitation to examine the question of Arab Federation had come from a Ministerial meeting presided over by^the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. In these circumstances the appropriate course seemed to be that the Report, v/hich would be signed by the Chairman on behalf of the Committee, should be forwarded to the Foreign Office under cover of an official letter from the Secretary. The Committee agreed to this procedure. George Street, S.W.I., 19TH DECEMBER, 1941.t SSS.£2SyiL 1 - : ^.I3 TI-E FR0P:i:5TY op his bbitannig majesty 1 s govermmIht S ECRET. hHE.

The following is an extract from S meeting of Ministers held at the Foreign Otfice on 26th September, 1941:- 'The Middle Eost Official Committee was invited to examine forthwith the various-forms which a scheme of nrah federation might take and to report oei advantages and disadvantages and pay In making this examination t h e I^nid. afford special regard to the help such a scheme would an. to a solution of the Palestine problem* It was made clear in the course of th ® that, in Committee was expected to proceed on^the a 3 laDmen t the view of H.M.G., ’’Arab federation was a ^elop ite calling for favourable consideration on its o ^ apart from its bearing upon the question ox Pal 2.

In the course of this speech, Mr. ^d »It seems to me both natural and right that the onitnrnl and economic ties between the ^rab countries, and the political ties, too, should His Majesty's Government, for their par , •, full support to any scheme that commands general approval.' , No doubt as a result of this speech, the Saudi nrabian would'be desirable lofje^s^gve™f to^tek^ the lead in preparing a scheme for was f a f t erwards ascertained awaiting the end. of the ™;' s , n „ tT , uctions f ro ra Ibn that the Minister ha e uggest ion did not correspond to Saud, and indeed thai. his s gg . lors Cairo and Ibn Saud's wishes, British ^soadorn Hlgh Bagdad, the British Minis inT ited to put forward their Commissioner for Palestine were ^ gnd all observations on the Minis that S ft wou id be unwise for His expressed the strong opinion that ^ h ™°^ or politica i Majesty's Govemnent t ° P r ° an | f hey recommended that, federation at the P r0 ^ n Mken it Should be confined to ^ZaS^se^^^^P^raliofifthe economic or cultural spheres. 4.

Lawrence', page 577). complicated problems might be reached. There ie much to ■be said for taking the initiative while he is still at the height of his power.* A second argument in favour of taking the initiative at present is that we now have in the Middle East a much stronger military force than v/e can ever hope to maintain there in time of peace, with the result that, for the moment at any rate, British influence is greater- now than it is likely to be after our troops have been withdrawn* Thirdly, the grant of independence to Syria and the Lebanon, and *the supercession (to that extent) of the Syrian Mandate, may be expected to stimulate Arab aspirations elsewhere, particularly in Palestine and Trans-Jordan, where, as time goes on, there may be increasing agitation against the continued maintenance of the Mandatory regime* If it were practical politics to carry through.some scheme of Arab federation which would also.comprise a satisfactory solution of the.Palestine problem, there would be much to be said in favour of immediate action, without awaiting the end of the waro 5. There are, on the other hand, strong arguments against an endeavour to promote a political federation of Arab States at the present moment. In the first place, there is nothing to show that Arab opinion is not yet prepared for any scheme s of federation. 35 Secondly, we believe that any scheme would in practice arouse such contentious issues that its discussion would inflame political passions throughout the Arab world, j and probably also throughout the Jev/ish world. Thirdly, we are convinced that any scheme sponsored by His Majesty‘s Government would be received with suspicion, and would . probably arouse much unnecessary anti-British feeling, at a time when it is essential not to take any incautious step which might give our enemies in the Arab world an opportunity 1 for exciting agitation against us. It is mainly for these reasons that our representatives in the Arab countries have unanimously recommended that the main problem should be allowed to lie dormant until the present imminent clangers of war in the Middle East have passed. 6. As regards Arab opinion, we are advised that u federation 11 has never represented a fixed* or genuine aspiration on the part of the Arab States or the Arab peoples as a whole, and must not be taken as one of the fundamental aims of^ the Arab national movement. So far as we are av/are, there is at * I x It is interesting to note what Colonel T • ID * Lawrence wrote on the subject in 1928:- ,r When people talk of Arab confederations or empires, they talk fantastically* It wil.i. be generations? I expect — unless the vital tempo of the Last- is much accelerated - before any two Arabic States join voluntarily. I agree their only future hope is ^that they should join but it must be a natural growing- together. Forced unions are pernicious2 and politics, ! in such things, should come after geography and economics. Communications and trade must be improved before provinces can join.'\ 2J^ y 1 1 i Majesty's a schenie, it would ; a territories ? / ijioment no i».ral) scheme oi‘ 'i'ecLera L-ion ■ iu There is no evidence that, if His to put forward such _ meet with favour in any quarter# It is not always remembered that three at least of the .iirab — n viz.

Nevertheless, while it may he un&amp;esirahle for His Majesty's Government to put forward at the present moment a wide scheme of political federation, it does not necessarily follow that no action whatever should he- taken in connexion with the vague Arab wishes for some form of closer co-operation between the Arab States. On the e* contrary, it appears to us that His Majesty’s Government might suitably take action in two directions without awaiting the end of the war. In the first place, since Arab nationalism, and the desire for a closer unity between the Arab States, is almost certain to grow, it is very desirable to examine carefully the question of what our own future policy should be, and what form v/e should prefer that any future Arab co-operatign should take. Secondly, we believe that there are~krei r tain restricted measures which ^ might usefully be taken even at the present junction, with * a view to encouraging closer co-operation between'the nrab States, In general, we accept the conclusion of His ] Majesty's representatives in Middle Eastern countries that it would be useful to study now some restricted measures of co-operation, with a view to showing practical sympathy with the Arab cause, and willingness to assist in removing some of the barriers which now separate the Arab States. 9. We have examined, as instructed in our terms of reference, a number of schemes of Arab federations details of which are summarised in the annex to this Report. V/e would point out that, in drav/ing up these schemes, v/e have ruled out any idea that some particular project should be imposed on the Arabs by force. We cannot contemplate, for example, a scheme for a federation under the supreme control of Ibn Saud to whom all the other Arab States would be invited, and,in the last resort,compelled to subordinate themselves. The Ministerial meeting on the 26th September recorded the view that ,f We could not force the Arab States into federation”. We can only record our full agreement with this conclusion. 10 « As a result of our examination of these schemes, we have formed the opinion that Saudi Arabia, the Yemen, and the other States of the Arabian Peninsula, are even more unsuited to participate in a scheme of federation than the less backward Arab countries further north. V/e are satisfied that if experiments in federation are to have any prospect of success they must at first be confined to Syria, the Lebanon, Palestine and Transjordan. For the present our main action should be in the direction of securing closer ^aoncmic co-operation between these four territories, and the British . j» 0 p 2 » 03 @fl t , kQ'tlves in the Middle East should be invited go draw up a scheme on this economic (not political) basis for consideration by His Majesty’s Government and, if approved by them, by the Free French authorities. On the political side, we should have no objection to the new independent Syria and the Lebanon adhering to the existing treaty of^ A?ab Brotherhood and Alliance”. On the cultural side, our representatives in the Middle East could be asned to consider what non-political projects of a cultural nature, dosigned to establish closer harmony between the Arab States, are deserving of encouragement.2-20 -5- 11. V/e have given attention, when examining these problems, to the difficult question of hov; British interests and British strategic needs can best be safeguarded if, as we^believe is probable, the Arab nationalist movement grows in importance, and Arab federation becorfes a more immediate problem tnan i is at present. Unfortunately, the pan-Arab movement, the j more extreme form of Arab nationalism, is largely inspired y anti-foreign motives. The Arab desire for a closer^union, in so far as such a desire exists, is in effect a wish to ^ form a block of Arab States v/hich will be strong enough to secure what are considered to be Arab rights in Palestine a . Syria, and to present a united front to foreign Pov/ers, especially Great Britain and Prance. It may easily be ^ # supposed that the movement for Arab federation is likely to degenerate into an anti-British, anti-French and, above all, an anti-Zionist and anti-Jewish movement. Tnis is a. very real danger. It is for this reason that it is so important that His Majesty^ Government should not content themselves with a purely negative policy, but should show positive sympathy towards the movement and endeavour to guide i , so far as possible, on lines which are ^e-t opposed ^ British interests. 12. We think that further consideration [should bel^iven to British strategic needs in the Arab States concerned. British interests in the Middle East have s communications and oil. We have found it diu.iicul ^ c-o [obtain any authoritative expression of opinion showing^how these essential British interests are to be sa^eguardea after the war. Yet it is clear that our general policy^ for years to come must be greatly affected by the exoenu to which we shall have to maintain military, naval or air bases in the territories concerned. 13.

Schemes fqr_Arab Fe deration . A* Politica l Federation 0 The territories concerned are: (a) The Kingdom of Egypt 0 Cb) The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia; the Kingdom^of the Yemen, the Sheikhdom of Koweit;. the Sheikhdom of Bahrein; the Sheikhdoms of Qatr and Trucial Oman; the Sultanate oi Muscat; the Colony of Aden and the Aden Protectorate. ( c) The Kingdom of Iraq. 0 (d) The Republic independent, but st Mandated territorie s of Syria and the Lebanon (each _ _ ill under French Mandate) ; *...the Briti o of Palestine and Transjordan. sh As regards Egypt, Sir M. Lampson reminds us that she considers herself the natural leader of the Arab world and would probably want to play some part in schemes of Arab federation. The chance of Egypt being willing to limit her own political independence by joining a confederation of Arab States seems, however, to be so remote that it has not been thought necessary to pursue this suggestion m further detail c Sch eme' I „ Federal scheme on a comprehensive scale covering the whole Arabian peninsula, Iraq, Syria, Palestine, etc., (i,e. all the territories named in(b),(c) 9 and (d; above). The constituent States would retain their independence of each other, and could maintain their separate_treaty and diplomatic relations with foreign powers, If..desired. They would send delegates to a federa? assembly._ The presidency of the confederation might be he in rotation; or preferably Ibn Saud might be president for life. The federal^ - assembly would have power to deal with certain specified questions, and federal law would on these questions take precedence of those of each individual State. The t constituent States would have a number of votes on^the assembly, roughly in proportion to the size of their population. Each constituent State would remain responsible for keeping order in its own territory. There would be federal machinery available for settling disputes between the constituent States, but if hostilities broke out, theie would be no obligation on other members of the confederation to join in the hostilities. External aggression against one of the constituent States would, on the other hand, be^ the concern of tho federation as a whole. iho confederation could not stand alone, and would requiro a military guarantee from E.M*Gc r who v/quld in return require^ guarantees safeguarding British interests and British strategic needs.as part of the new arrangements, an endeavour should he , made to secure Arab and Jewish consent to a solution of the Palestine -orohlem, involving the abolition of the Mandate, new arrangements for Transjordan, and for the Jewish National Home, Advantages . ( 1) Such a comprehensive scheme would show Arabs that we are taking seriously their repeated cry for unity . (2) It would show the world at large that H.M.G-* were taking a wide view of post-war settlements. ('*)) An Arab organisation of this magnitude might be more prepared to make concessions to the Jews on the Mediterranean seaboard. Disadvantages . ( l) There is good reason to suppose that any such scheme would make no appeal to the Arab rulers concerned e.g. Ihn Saud the King of the Yemen or the Amir Abdullah of Transoorda . Nor is there reason to believe that it would be supported at present by any of the Arab States. f 2 )* H.M. Minister at Jedda has pointed out that it is difficult to see how Saudi Arabia could usefully participate in any scheme of federation. That backward country had little contribution to make to a federation and could not derive any advantage from federation. (- 5 ) . The Yemen is an even less promising member, nor are ^ the Sheikhdoms of the Persian Gulf at all q.ualifiea. ~ difficul^-fc^fe^^rr (4) draw the Aden protectorate practicability . A confederation which would include Saudi Arabia, the Yemen, the Persian Gulf States, Muscat and the Aden / rot ^ t ^^ is likely to be impracticable for many years tocome. If there is to be any progress towards political federation, a start will have to be made in the more progressive Arab countries further north. Scheme II* A federal scheme on a more restricted scale, covering - Iraq., Syria, Palestine etc., but omitting oaudi Arabia and the other States of the Arabian Peninsula. It is sufficient to say that rivalry between Ibn baud and the Hashimite family is such that Ibn Saud would regard ^ federal scheme on these lines as directly opposed to his vital interests. For this reason alone, it would be best to make a start with Syria, the Lebanon, Palestine and Transjordan, leaving Iraq out of the picture until a later stage,’Scheme III. A federal scheme applying only to oynia, the Lebanon, Palestine and Transjordan, The essence of this scheme is that 4 £? der ^ + .^_ 1 machinery should he established to deal with po &gt; ieS ^ as well as economic, matters affecting the fo -federal The greater the powers which could he given to the- federal machinery, the greater chance there would he that the^ scheme might assist towards a solution of th F problem. All Middle Eastern experts are agreed that if Arab federation is to he brought about, Syria, he Lebanon and Palestine are by far the most suitable territories, and a start might well be made there. ’•Greater Syria” was a single unit in the past, nmer Turkish rule. Its separation into Syria, tde L ^^ ti and Palestine was (as the High Commissioner for Pal has pointed out) a defiance of history^ and has eon responsible for much trouble. There is infact an underlying unity between the three territories. ™e present boundaries between them are unnatural and indeed indefensible by any accepted principles. The difficulties are, however, very great. (a) The French have always objected strongly to Arab federation. The Free French will^certainly oppose any far-reaching scheme for closer political union between Syria and the Lebanon on the one hand and Palestine and Transjordan on the other. From the French point of view this might be regarded as a manoeuvre for increasing British influence in the Levant at the expense of French influence. y v(b) As regards Palestine, it-4rfi'-ttirrfTcult to ^ 7 how Palestine, while still a mandated State, could federate with Syria and the Lebanon. If and when-Palestine acquires vu . independence she will be free to^d^Pate with Syria and the Lebanon if she so dost-nes. It is therefore arguable that a solution of-th^rp'alestine question is an_ essential preliminary 1 a&gt;' dny scheme of Arab federation which is intended to include Palestine. (c) As regards Transjordan, it would be difficult to leave Transjordan out of any scheme which included Palestine, Syria and the Lebanon, but it would be equally difficult W fit the Emir Abdullah into any such scheme. We should have to show somehow or other that we recognised the Emir Abdullah’s loyal services to us for the past twenty years. Any proposals, however, that the ,Emir Abdullah should become King of the whole area would be strongly resisted by Ibn Saud. For these three reasons, viz. French suspicions, the necessity for a solution of the Palestine problem, and the Emir Abdullah’s position, it is considered essential to confine our proposals, at all events at first, to the economic sphere (see Scheme V below).Scheme IV . A development of the Treaty of Arab Brotherhood Imd Alliance. This Treaty, which provides for consultation and co-operation, was concluded in 1936 'between Iraq, and Saudi Arabia. The Yemen acceded in 1937, The suggestion now for consideration is whether this Treaty might be extended, and its provisions reinforced, to provide the basis for Arab federation. For example, Syria and the Lebanon, now that they have acquired their independence, might be encouraged to accede to the Treaty. Then, in due course, arrangements might be made for representatives of* the parties to the Treaty to meet from time to time to discuss questions of joint interest, and put into effect the provisions regarding consultation between the parties to the Treaty. In this way ? regular federal machinery might be gradually developed. Advantages . There would be advantage in building upon the foundation of an existing treaty, particularly on a treaty concluded between Arab rulers on their own unprompted initiative. Disadvantages . It would be more difficult for His Majesty f s Government to exercise any guiding influence if federation were to take this fom. It is clear that, so long as the British Mandate continues, Palestine could not adhere to a 'Treaty of Arab Brotherhood'; and its exclusion might tend to give the federation an increased tendency to criticise and oppose British policy and Jewish aspirations in Palestine. It is to be noted, however, that so far the existing 'brotherhood' has taken little or no effective action; and it is possible that increased membership would no.t lead to greater activity,, If Syria and the Lebanon should wish to adhere to the Treaty of Arab Brotherhood, there is no reason why His Majesty’s Government should not encourage the movement! B. Economic Co-operation . In general, the removal of economic barriers should be encouraged, but it would seem best to make a start with Syria, the Lebanon, Palestine and Transjordan. Scheme V. Economic Co-operation betv/een Syria, the Lebanon, Palestine and Transjordan. The Minister of State has recommended that British representatives in the Middle East should be instructed to draw up such a scheme. This suggestion should certainly be approved. In the meanwhile- no attempt has been made in London to work out detailed proposals. Advantages . A purely economic (rot political) scheme would seem to be in the general interests of the four territories mentioned, and there seems no reason why the Free French should necessarily object. It is to be hoped that the removal of the economic barriers may reduce the unnecessary inconvenience arising from the present artificial frontiers.It should 'bo noted, however, that measures of co-operation in the economic sphere are likely to lea o a desire for measures of co-operation in the politica sphere, viz. a scheme started on these lines might develop on the lines of scheme III above. C. Cultural Co-operation . The British Ambassador at Bagdad .wrote as follows in a recent despatch; ’'Cultural barriers could possibly be removed by establishing closer harmony in school curricula, by periodical cultural conferences, by the publication of journals of common interest to all, by the exchange of students in higher^ educational institutions and similar devices.” There seems to be no objection to British representatives in the Middle Bast being authorised to encourage such cultural contacts between the Arab States. It is perhaps worth noting that it is in these matters within the cultural sphere that Egypt comes into the picture. Cairo is regarded by the Egyptians as the ^ cultural centre of the Arab world. it is not certain how far it would be wise for His Majesty’s Government to^ take the initiative in cultural questions affecting the ^».rab States^ but we can at least show ourselves ready to welcome and support any initiative taken by the Arabs themselves.•v 55CHET ( 22^ B&gt;.v- ig'. i- if- xi(.i(.|. 3rd December 19^1.

His-Ma jesty * s Government had much experience in work o. . this kind and • uniess they gave a lead and helped the Arabs by offerine: .loir advice and, if possible, putting a scheme forward,' i o vvould be hardly possible to make progress.

It is difficult to see what useful advice could be given by His Majesty’s Government or what scheme worked out until there is more agreement on what is meant by the rather vague term of Arab federation. For instance, is it envisaged as a political federation under a single leadership or in the form of states bound together by a comprehensive political agreement? Or is it contemplated under the more modest forms of cultural, trade and customs unions? 3. Another point to be considered is the extent of territory which such a federation would aim at embracing. The Saudi Arabian Minister mentioned only Arabia, Iraq and Syria. Palestine is an important omission from this list for without it any Arab Federation would be defective for practical purposes. Moreover, Egypt, it must be remembered, considers herself the natural leader of the Arab world and would probably want to play some part in such federative schemes. 4. The chances are that any politcal federation of Arab states would not be a practical proposition for some time. The strong existing rivalries between Arab rulers and personalities of the different states involved, e.g. King Ibn Baud's feud with the Hashimites, constitute serious obstacles to an Arab federation. Apart from these native difficulties,' there are the foreign difficulties, i.e. our position in Palestine and that of the French in Syria. Are we prepared to establish a native government in Palestine which, under a British administration, could hardly enter an Arab Federation? Are the French prepared to waive their fundamental opposition to Syria’s., entry into any federative scheme? * 5. Cultural, economic and customs unions of Arab countries might be more practical politics, and these aspects of ’’federation” might be studied now. 6. Palestine, no doubt, will have much to say regarding /thethe possibilities of economic union which would react on some of its industries built up under a wall of protection. Anyhow, the question of economic unity would have to be discussed by economic experts with local knowledge of the situation in the countries concerned. As regards cultural union the danger of our doing anything to promote it at the present moment is that cultural contacts inevitably lead to political ones, an( ~ in the existing state of feeling in the Egypto-Arab world great prudence would have to be exercised in encouraging such contacts during the course of the war. 7.

With reference to your despatch No.103 (E.4761/53/65; of Avigust 27th, I have the nonour to submit herewith some observations on the question of Arab federation. 2. I should like to say first of all that it seems to me improbable that Hafiz Wahba in speaking to you as he did on August 13th was acting on instructions from hing Abdul Aziz . His Majesty's position in the Arab world is-in. fact one of the big problems that face those who seek to bring the principal Arab countries, closer together and he has not in the past shown any real desire to further Arab federation except insofar as such federation might serve his own* dynastic ambitions. I am disposed tnerefore- to think that Hafiz Wahba, in the manner common to many of Ibn Saud's representatives abroad, was expressing hi sown rather than his master's views. ' 3. Tne High Commissioner has stated in a.recent note on this subject that among the Arabs in Palestine interest in federation is waning because they suspect the motives of the Jews wno are pushing it. In Syria tne. free Irehch nave set up ,a Government which enjoys little, favour-with the nationalist party, who appear to be far too bus-y with internal matters to show any immediate interest in plans, for Arao federation. Moreover as, according to many.. ; accounts the Syrian nationalists are under German -influence, it would seem probable that as a matter of principle they would oppose any action taken by the present .Syrian administration and would prooably be unwilling to- cooperate with us in tni s matter. ' 4. In Egypt interest in Arab federation is at the best luke-warm and apparently confined to a-few enthusiasts and in Iraq internal politics are tne dominant interest of, the moment. In all reports which have, reached me there, has /' been no hint of a desire that we should take the initiative. 5. I have no doubt that the question of Arab f ederat.ion. i s of great and urgent importance to all Arab nationalists but it seems that at present there is no general movement in the Arab countries in favour of raising it and rj see no advantage indeed many disadvantages, in our setting, the ball rolling. In Iraq pan-Arab activity has in the past-been closely associated with anti-British propaganda and has invariably led to a feeling of unrest and to demonstrations of ill-will. towards/towards the non-Arab (and non-iviuslin) elements, in the country* Moreover the underlying motive of Arab federation is in its essence anti-foreign. It is inspired by a wish to form a block of Arab States which will be strong enough to^ secure what are considered to be Arab rights in Pale’-stinc^^tid Syria, to strengthen the independence of all the Arab countrie concerned and to piesent a united front to foreign powers, especially Great Britain and Prance. 6. Nevertheless it is I think in our interests to move with tne stream and to continue to show sympathy towards the movement as it develops strength. I take this view partly because we shall only incur tne enmity of the Arabs if we oppose the movement, partly because in spite of its potentially hostile inspiration it need not necessarily^ be inimical to our interests, and indeed could in certain circumstances be beneficial, and partly because we know that the.jealousies and rivalries between the different Arao countries will deprive it of much of its dangers. 7. Although, as I have mentioned above, public interest in unity or federation is not now unusually active it is inevitable that tne question will be raised by the Arabs either in tne near or more distant future and it is important that His Majesty’s Government should decide beforehand the policy which it will be wise to follow when this occurs. fhe advantage of securing french agreement to any plan adopted should be borne in mind. 8. The countries concerned are clearly not yet ripe for full coalescence but it would not I think be impossible to evolve a practicable plan for a modest beginning. -*-he first objective to be aimed at would have to be limited in .scope and should I suggest be regarded more as a step towards the removal of the artificial cultural and economic barriers that have grown up between the Arab countries than anything so ambitious as the organisation of any form of political federation. With this principle in mind initial experiments could be conveniently restricted to the adjacent territories of Iraq.9 Syria, Transjordan and Palestine. 9 There axe many practical difficulties in the way of the application of this idea but I think that through close study of the prevailing conditions in each country means could be found to overcome them. Cultural barriers could possibly be removed by establishing closer harmony in school curricula by periodical cultural conferences, by the publication of journals of common interest to all, by.the exchange of students in highei' educational institutions and similar devices. The xemoval of economic barriers such as different currencies, different tariff systems and in some instances conflicting local interests would be a more- diilicult, bu y no means an impossible task. As Dr. Magnes ol tne Hebrew University in Jerusalem pointed out in a recent paper, history ms shown that economic union can be organised successfully before political union takes place and can appripriately be made the first expression of the political aims of countxies which desire to federate. 10 The fact that Syria has now been brought into the Sterling Area is important and should simplify many aspects of this problem.(Scd.) KINAHAN CORNWALLIS 11. Wnen tne time comts to deal with an effective demand foi federation it mignt be possible for His Majesty’s Government to facilitate the setting up of Commissions to study these- questions and to report to the Governments #(( ^concerned. Such Commissions should have a preponderant *v Arab &lt; lament with British experts to assist. 12. A restricted scheme of tnis kind should be advantageous to us and should lead to increased contentment and prosperity amongst the Arabs. Since* however* it ignore the idea of political federation* it would not satisfy the extreme and vociferous nationalist elements and* if proposed by us, would be likely to meet with a hostile reception, especially so long as the Syrian and Palestine questions remain unsolved. It is those questions which are the cause of most of our troubles with the Arabs and, until they are settled, any initiative which we might take along the lines, set forth above, would, I feel sure, be regarded with suspicion in many quarters. 13. It appears probable that the responsible Arab leaders themselves will come to the conclusion that their wisest course is to begin slowly. They talk vaguely of .'political confederation and unity but I do not believe that any of them have attempted to define those terms. When they ‘come to realise the immense difficulties which exist, I have a feeling that they will shrink from trying to solve them and tnat they will be tne more ready to turn to us for help and advice after they nave made t eir own decision to start on more modest lines. 14. For obvious practical reasons it would be better tnat any action of this kind should be postponed until we can visualise what will oe the basis of the post-war settlement and I nope that the whole question will be allowed to lie dormant until the present imminent dangers of war in the Middle Bast have passed. It is however quite likely that our hands may be forced earlier than we wish and for tnis reason I would suggest that the action to be taken to meet such an eventuality should be studied on the lines adumbrated abovt. 15.

You will realise th .t what is required is something more constructive than an analysis of the many difficulties in the way of any scheme of .a-ab federation. Problem involves clearing our own minds as to what the future of the various Arab territories ought to be, and consequently what the ultimate aim of British policy in these territories .ought to be. As a result of the study of these fundamental questions * it should be less difficult to decide whether the time nas now come for His Majesty’s Government to take some further step, and whether they should attempt to take the initiative in drawing up some practicable scheme for bringing about some form of federation or closer co-operation between tne .ir.ab States.- 8 - 3NCL0SURS NOc 5 &gt; * ' ! ‘- Copy of Jclu^ram No. 3,221 dated 14th October , 19U1 from Cairo' to tho Foreign Offic eV My despatch No, 939 containing my views as called for in your despatch No. 266 left by air on October 6th. It should, therefore, be in your hands in the next few days. 2, My broad conclusion was that political federation was not at present a practical possibility owing, amongst other things, to bitter rival claims to the leadership of various Arab States e.g. Iraq, Ibn Saud, (G-rp. undec. ? latterly) Egypt, but that something on the lines of cultural or economic federation might be more feasible though, even there, there are obstacles that may be insurmountable. 3, If the above is correct, it follows your question of. what the future of various Arab territories ought to be, if we are considereing practical possibilities, is difficult to answer. In their ultimate interest I should surmise it would be right to begin v/ith some form of zolluercin, , possibly leading later in the course of years and in the light of practical experience to v/ider union of some kind. This wider union might best be promoted by giving all the States concerned sufficient independence to enable them ’freely to negotiate federative agreements and by encouraging them to do so. But we should then have to face:— (1) Giving large measure of independence to Palestine. (2) Taking a different line in regard to Zionism and (3) Forcing the French to restrict their special rights in Syria and the Lebanon to an extent which would not preclude an Arab Federation (e.g. on lines similar to the rights which we enjoy in Iraq under the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty). Our recent recognition of French interests in Syria does not necessarily go beyond this. In my opinion such a scheme can only be envisaged as a possible long term policy dependent on the success of the first steps tov/ards closer and cultura.! relations. 4, Whether a strong union of the Arab states would be to our advantage is another matter. Our main material interests in the area in question are, and are likely to-9- remain, c on-muni cat ions and oil, to secure which uho continued presence of troops and the possession ox aerodromes in various parts of the area will presumably ou necessary* -Arab nationalism .will naturally tend to work for the removal of these symbols of foreign occupy- oion^g^i on the other hand the Arabs are so exposed to foreign dangers that they might acquiesce for a long time in military guarantees, though -not without ’much grumbling* The problem of our*post-war interests in all this part of the world must largely be strategic; and before we can attempt to frame a wider political scheme for the area involved it seems essential to Itnow more clearly what our strategic requirements will be* Consider particularly the questions of 'the Persian Gulf and Southern Arabia and the effect on our interests there of an Arab federation. These suem o me additional reasons for limiting our present efforts to 'economise) and possibly the cultural field in so far as e Arab world in general is concerned* 5. All experts seem agreed, however, that the separation of Palestine from Syria is artificials I agree with Sir H. MacMichael. that this separation is unnatural * and th*at there are more practical possibilities in -some form of limited federative union there, in the interests both of those areas and our own* • But we should have to square the French* authority be likely 7* To turn back to I should be very chary to take any initiative 5, A few days ago I discussed the idea of Arab, federation with His Majesty’s Minister to Saudi Arabia prior to his return to-his post* He was ox the opinion that, if the Saudi Arabian Minister in London had raised the idea, he must have done so on his own and without from Ibn Saud, seeing that the latter would never to agree to any federation not under his hegemony. paragraph 4 of your telegram (sic), of advising His Majesty’s Government in this mattero I do not believe it will at present lead anywhere, save to probable odium and misinterprea.tion* I should therefore counsel confining our role, as in the past, to vague expressions of good-will as and when opportune* ■ For example, your recent public statement which created an excellent impression though somewhat dulled by our subsequent-re-instatement of Free French in Syria* If, as .a practical fornrof good-will, decisions embodied,in the a/hite Paper could be reaffirmed and their implementation expedited I believe that would do far more good and be far less risky than embarking on the initiation or the sponsoring of any scheme of political federation which, to my mind, is not at this time a matter of uractical politics* If on their own initiative c.ny Arab state suggested customs union or economic rapprochement, then would be the time for us to show practical interest and encouragement* (IHDIV.)ENCLOSURE NO. 6, 1941 Your telegram No. 3431 to Cairo.

As I felt convinced that Itn Sand had not instructed his representative at London to raise the question, 1 Y u Yasin without mentioning Hafiz Wahba s demarche, ™ h ® t King had recently been considering the question of Arab federation. 2. Yusuf Yasin replied as I expected, that though the of relations with the Arabs was of the greatest concern ^ 1 Saud his whole thought was now concentrated on the war a achievement^of Allief victory. Unless mis victory were achieved, the Arabs would have little say m the settlement of their prooxems. 3. Yusuf Yasin's personal view was that Arab federation impracticable, if by the term was meant the form in force in United States. Some form of close union might eventually be achieved but not for many years. The first pre-r q .^ division of Arab lands into as few separate units as possible, fhl was not referring to the division of Palestine from Syria but of the sub-divisions of Syria), the second was the achievementof harmony and in due course of complete independence in each Arab unit. Whatever bonds united them, the Arab countries could no , Yusuf Yasin thought, stand alone. They would need the suppor of a European power, but of one only, and that Great Britain. 4. I find it difficult to see how any form of federation could be of advantage to Saudi Arabia - nor even how they c °Uf- d t)e fitted into any such scheme. Federation can, presumably, only be achieved by States enjoying /grp. undec._/ approximately the same form of Government and which have reached the same standards of culture. Saudi Arabia must, by its nature, differ. The Hejaz is a Moslem?Cp)reservation, the rest of the country consists of a conglomeration of primitive Beduim, chiefly held together by prestige of one man. Saudi Arabia has thus\ little contribution to make even to a cultural and economic union* 5. Unless Xbn Saud took an entirely altruistic view, it is difficult to see how he could support the idea of federation. a federation of Arab states which excluded Saudi Arabics might be regarded by him as a menace especially if under (A.A)-« --himi e. In a federation which included Saudi Arabia, his backward and primitive country x could play only an insignificant role. 6 Ibn Saud's hope is, I think, not that the Arabs should he united 'S one unit, but that they should achieve close friendship amongst themselves and unity of purpose and policy in close collaboration with Great Britain. /Repeated to Cairo under Foreign Office No.3714 Bagdad under Foreign Office No.1106 and Jerusalem under Colonial Office No.1714._yr TO BE KEPT UNDER KP V It Is requested that special care may be kken ensure the secrecy of this document.

We must hold the United Kingdom secure and supply it. 2, For this - (a) The sources of supply must he safe. (h) The lines of cornmunication must he secure. O. The importance of the Atlantic as a supply route is well Known. The importance of our Indian Ocean sea communications is not so well known hut is equally vital to us because the development of the maximum war effort of the British Commonwealth, and indeed its very existence, depends on the maintenance of these highways, 4. Thus the enemy must not he allowed to obtain direct access to and bases in the Indian Ocean, as our naval requirements to defend the vital cominuni cat ions in that area would then be greater than those now required to contain the Italian Fleet. 5. Furthermore- we require certain economic advantages which we can now draw from the Middle East, 6. In particular Iranian oil is necessary to maintain our eastern life lines. The Tanker situation is now- acute and we have insufficient to carry oil from other sources to supply our eastern shipping. Moreover, if Abadan were lost the security of the East Indies oil fields would be vital to our existence. With Japan sided with our enemies this source is not secure. V* We must also cover India. If we do not, and the rot spreads in the Arab world, India will be a liability instead of an asset.- 2 *- 8. T.c prevent the enemy from threatening our Ocean sea routes and seizing our Middle East raw we must hold defensive p sitions. to cover them* 9. Defence iij. depth is necessary. # It is not to hold the outer ring, even i.f we could do so. 10. * Egypt, Syria and Irac give us those positions. The inclusion of Turkey and Iran would improve our . position. The capture of Cyrenaica would better ia. 11. Defensiv e ly, therefore t it is sound strategy . to ho ld at least our present positions. FOR OFFENSIVE AGAINST GERMANY. —— 12. The collapse of France reduced our powers of carrying out our offensive strategy in the Middle East, but these pov/ers are by no means lost, .st we hold our present x^o^iii 011 we can:- Interrupt tranquil Axis trade in the Mediterranean. Even by the use of submarines and aircraft alone we have achieved considerable success. Impose a measure of blockade by denying the enemy many of the economic benefits of the Middle East. Attack Italy and, later, with growing resources, attack enemy communications with North Africa, Greece and the Balkans. the future, the holding of our present position a base from which to - Recapture Cyrenaica.; and restore the mobility of the Fleet. (ii) (iii) (iv) (ii) Drive the Axis powers from Libya; threaten Italy with -direct attack; and possibly bring in French North Africa on our side. (iii) Bolster up Turkey. (iv) Join hands, with Russia through Iran. 15, Thus, to fulfil oui offensive strate.gy the holding of our present wosi'cion is necessary , CONCLUSION ON STRATEGY. 16. By retaining our present position in the Middle East, we extend the German effort and compel Germany to maintain her forces over long and difficult lines of communications at a time when her transport system is working at a maximum strain. In particular, large air forces are contained which could otherwise be used elsewhere. Whi 1 (a) (W (c) 14. In will give us U) Indian materials, enough/■N If we withdrew to an outer ring;, not only would our whole position 'be greatly worsened but we should suffer:- (a) A tremendous setback to morale in the United Kingdom, the Dominions? India and our Moslem countries. (b) The immediate reactions in Spain and Turkey who would throw in their lot with Germany. This would react most unfavourably on the Atlantic battle. (c) Great material loss; we should not be able to save more than a small proportion of the vast quantities of material now accumulating. (d) Considerable' economic loss ? even if we held the Iranian oil fields. This would be disastrous if Abandan were lost or che refinery were destroyed. Germany would gain in proportion to our loss, and would have a free run over the whole of the Mediterranean, North Africa, and Asia as far as India, without having had to tight for it. She must be made to fight for every inch.

As part of this arrangement King Ibn Saud would be expected to agree that, on the formation of this Federation, he would enter into a treaty setting up a Jewish autonomous State in Palestine. This scheme-had. been felt by the Ministers to be impracticable if only because we could not compel -the Arab rulers to .accept the suzerainty of Ibn Saud. The Ministers were nevertheless anxious that the possibilities of federation should be explored not only as offering a possible solution of the Palestine problem, but also as being in itself a desirable object. ... • y • : - --M l ni •J..V .j':rr Essential interests of H a M. Gey or lime nt He suggested that the Committee should first determine.what were the essential interests and obligations of His Majesty^ Government in the area: these might be conveniently considered under the headings (A) Political and (b) Strategic 0 The following is a summary of the main points ..in..the y discussion under these headings. A. Political . (1) The F oreign Office consider that the essential British interests may 'be' summarised as the maintenance of Imperial communications, the safeguarding of British oil interests,,.and the exclusion from the area of the influence of any major, power that might at any time become hostile to us; Apart from these general desiderata, there are a number of existing commitments, e.g. (a) The Treaty of Alliance with Iraq: (b) The Suez Canal Agreement: (c) The treaties with the independent rulers of the Persian Gulf region and of the Aden Protectorate. Fur t her, a joint Anglo-Fr o o .French guar ant ce had recently been given to the people of-Syria and the Lebanon and His Majesty f s Government had recognised the pre-eminent position- : -bf France over other European countries in these territories. (2) The Colonia l O ffice are concerned with the implementation'of past pledges and the conduct of future policy in Palestine. It has been publicly' stated (White Paper of 1939, paragraph 10(7)) that in the event of the establishment of an-2- independexlt Palestinian State, adequate provision would have to be made for (a) the security of, and freedom of access to, the Holy Places, and the protection of the interests and property of the various religious bodies, C'b) the protection of the different communities in Palestine in accordance with the obligations of His Majesty*s Government to both Arabs and Jews and for the special position in Palestine of the Jewish National Home© • X (c) such requirements to meet the strategic \ - situation as may be regarded as necessary by His Majesty*s Government in the light.of the \ circumstances then existing, ; Further, His Majesty* s Government would also have to ' : • be satisfied that the interests of certain foreign .countries in.Palestine, for the preservation of which they are at present responsible, are adequately safeguarded© Finally, His Majesty's Government are responsible for carrying out the stipulations contained in the Agreement with the Amir of Trans-Jordan, (3). The principal interest of t he Government of I ndia is to maintain the tranquility of the Persian GuBT^area© They would probably be opposed to any scheme of federation v/hich would prejudice their interests there,' e* g© if it were proposed that such rulers as the Sheikhs of Koweit and Bahrein or the Ghe:-kG of the Trucial coast should be placed under the hegemony of the King of Saudi Arabia, It would in sny case n e essential to ensure, under any form of Federation* th^t our ability to carry out our guarantees to protect these Tcrtes against external aggression should not be weak one do B, Strategic © (1) Naval © The Admiralty consider it to be essential that (b) In the Persian Gulf we must continue to possess the (c) We snould not allow ary strong power to establish itself in the area of the Middle-3- (2) Military ? The interests of the '7ar Office are to^ secure the right 'to maintain garrisons and safeguard communica^ tions as may he necessary* These requirements would necessitate the preservation of internal security within tne Arab States, involving the appointment of advisers and the control of foreigners. (3) Air . Prom the Air Ministry*s point of view the Middle East (including Persia) is the most important strategical area in the world. Within this area the maintenance of peace and the rigid exclusion of all hostile influences are vital necessities. It contains oil wells v/ithout which our Middle East War effort would be crbppled, and it constitutes a central point of support in our system of imperial communications. Having no industrial resources, the Arab countries within the area are incapable, either^ individually or collectively, of establishing and maintaining an air force which could defend them against aggression from any industrialised power, and we must accordingly assume responsibility for their defence against air attach. The Air Ministry would not oppose a soheme for Arab federation so, long as it would not increase the dangers of internal disorder or mahe it more difficult for them to secure their defence requirements in the territories concerned. They would deprecate a joirit Anglo-French guarantee to an Arab federation if it meant that the French v/ere to be given a say in the formulation of our policy for the whole area. Scope and Constitution of an Arab Feder ation. . .. i. • , * Discussion then turned to the question of the scope of the proposed Federation and of the model which might be followed for its constitution. It was generally agreed that it would in any case be necessary to exclude, for the time being at any rate, the possibility of Egypt joining the Federation, and that the choice lay between: V- ; (a) A federal union on a small scale to include only Syria and the Lebanon, Palestine and Trans-Jordaru (b) A wider federation embracing all the Arab States including Saudi Arabia, Iraq, the Yemen and the Aden Protectorate, and the Arab Rtetec on the Persian Gulf coast. The suggestion was made that, if the latter alternative were adopted, the German Federal Constitution of 18?1 might serve as a useful model in regard to certain details. Time for Establishm ent of a Federation . As regards the time for the establishment of a Federation there was something to be said for proceeding as soon as possible with any promising scheme provided it could be based upon a strong strategic position in the Middle East and the exercise of a decisive influence in the Arab world, . This might be preferable to postponing settlement until the Peace Ccnferenca&lt;&gt;-4- / im mi’niMnninm / In this connection it is to .be rcmeriibered that, while bhc Mandate for Syria has been formally renounced., one Mandate for Palestine and Trans-Jordan still, remains in our hands. This may prove ; a useful bargaining counter 0 Need for Secrecy. Emphasis was laid on the need for maintaining complete secrecy in regard to 'the Committee's discussion* If it became known that .a scheme for Arab federation was under consideration in London, there were likely to be agitations and intrigues that would go far co prejudice the chances of a satisfactory settlement. 'CONCLUSIONS.

The function of the series is not to advocate policies, but to present in a brief and convenient form some of the considerations relevant to each issue as it arises. These papers will not, except by special authorization, be distributed to anyone not working in Government Service. It has not been thought desirable to bind the series to regular dates of publication, but it is anticipated that the papers will normally appear at fortnightly intervals.-i ARAB FEDERATION The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, speaking at the Mansion House on the 29th May, 1941, made the following statement: ‘The Arab world has made great strides since the settlement reached at the end of the last war, and many Arab thinkers desire for the Arab peoples a greater degree of unity than they now enjoy. In reaching out towards this unity they hope for our support. No such appeal from our friends should go j*«answered. It seems to me both natural and right that the cultural and economic ties between the Arab countries, and the political ties too, should be strengthened. His Majesty’s Govern ment for their part will give their full support to any scheme that commands general approval.’ The purpose of this paper is to discuss, firstly, the meaning of Arab Federation, and, secondly, the form and directions in which support may be needed for its realization. 1 . The Objectives of Pan-Arabism The object of the pan-Arab movement is to translate the cultural unity of the Arabic-speaking countries into a political union. The most authoritative definition of this political objec tive is given in the first article of the Arab Covenant formulated at Jerusalem on the 13th December, 193 1 • The Arab lands are a complete and indivisible whole, and the divisions of whatever nature to which they have been subjected are not approved nor recognized by the Arab nation.’ By Article 2 of the same Covenant Arab nationalists are pledged to direct their efforts in every Arab country ‘towards the single goal of their complete independence, in their entirety and unified , and every ideal which seeks to limit the sphere of action to local and regional politics’ is condemned. The ultimate objective is thus the inclusion of all Arab countries, in both Asia and Africa, in a single unified State. Since this is not at present a practical possibility the first duty of Arab nationalists is to work for the liberation of all Arab territories from foreign control and the establishment of fully independent Governments in each. As the next objective, the nationalists in the Near East aim at forming a federation of Iraq, Syria, Palestine and Transjordan, with or without Saudi Arabia and Yemen, while those in North-West Africa aspire to the creation of a similar federation of the North African coun tries, excluding Egypt. These groups of countries, it is hoped,2 W- / will enter into mutual economic and political agreements which will pave the way to some form of federal organization. The danger of separatist tendencies within each country can, they believe, be overcome by the pressure of public opinion and the creation of a network of cultural and economic organizations on a pan-Arab basis. No exact definition of what is meant by federation is generally current. It is assumed that it implies a common economic, financial, foreign and military policy, but the organs by which such policy would be elaborated, discussed and decided a^not clearly specified. The relation of Egypt to a federation o. .irab States is also undefined. Although Egypt has a national tradi tion of its own, it is a part of the Arab world, of which, indeed, it is the cultural leader at the present time; and both in Egypt and in the other Arab countries it is generally believed that the ties which already exist between them will eventually be drawn much closer. 2 . The Obstacles to a closer Arab Union The strength of Arab nationalism lies in the fact that, with few exceptions, every leader and every party in the Arab countries accepts its programme in general outline. Its weak ness lies partly in the vagueness of this programme, and partly in the serious obstacles to its progress which arise out of existing conditions. These are of two kinds, internal and external. (i) Internal obstacles: (a) The existence of inherited dissociative forces within the Arab world, especially dynastic rivalries and sectarian or communal antagonisms. (b) The development of new obstacles to unity, such as regional economic interests and nationalist sentiment, in the post-1918 political units. (c) Political inexperience and retarded economic develop ment. (ii) External obstacles: (d) The Mandates in Syria and Palestine, and the status of the Jewish National Home. (e) French, Italian and Spanish rule in North-West Africa. Although it is rarely possible to dissociate these factors in the discussion of specific problems, the nationalist leaders have, in accordance with their programme, stressed almost exclusively the external obstacles to the attainment of their goal. It must3 he recognized that in the present excited and hypersensitive state of nationalist feeling no progress towards a settlement of internal Arab questions can be made until the broad lines of a settlement of Arab relations with the Western Powers have been laid down, more especially in relation to the status of Syria and Palestine. Exasperation at the lack of progress made hitherto has produced a readiness to resort to violence, exemplified by the outbreaks in Syria and Palestine and the recent rising in Iraq. It is, therefore, essential for the stabilization of the Near EasU^iat a more organic political and economic system should repL.~e the present conflicts of interests. 3 . The Reconstitution of Syrian Unity The passionate insistence of Arab nationalists upon the wrong done to the Arabs by the administration of the French Mandate in Syria and the separation of Palestine and Trans jordan from Syria, together with the establishment of a Jewish National Home in Palestine, rests upon natural social, geo graphical and economic grounds. The disruption of their former economic unity, the hindrances placed in the way of political progress by subdivision and colonial administration, the embittering of confessional and regional antagonisms which have been to a great extent attenuated in other Arab countries, are felt all the more keenly since Syria-Palestine is the keystone of any unified political structure in Arab Asia. Palestine is the strategic link between the eastern Arab countries and Egypt; Syria, with its frontage on the Mediterranean, is their economic link with Europe. Syria was the nursery of the nationalist movement; lacking Syria, Arab nationalism is a body without a head. That grave difficulties exist in the way of reconstituting Syria outright as a single sovereign State is admitted by all but extreme nationalists. Nevertheless, the undoing of the hindrances placed in the way of Syria’s advance to independence must be the first step towards any practical accommodation with Arab nationalism. The external problems which call for solution are those of the relations of a Syrian State with Great Britain as the guaran tor of Jewish interests and with France as the guarantor of the Christians of Lebanon. But it seems certain that no solution would be acceptable to the Arabs which involved the indefinite maintenance of foreign political control, or a geographical distribution of French and British interests and influence. This■ point is of particular relevance to the questions discussed in paragraph 6. Internally, the considerations indicated in paragraph 5 suggest that only a federal arrangement is practicable in Greater Syria, an area which, indeed, offers the most promising field for the immediate application of the federal ideal. 4 . The Framework of Federal Unity in Arab Asia Given a clear idea of the immediate objective and the re moval of the external obstacles to the association of Syi^^and Palestine with the other Arab countries, the task of Arab nationalism will be to construct the framework of a wider federal organization. So far as the questions involved have been thought out at all, the nationalists appear to contemplate a triple system of cultural collaboration, economic and military agreements, and finally a constitutional linking-up of the whole. (a) Cultural collaboration implies the unification of the standard language, of education and professional services, and, at a further remove, of law. Rudimentary organs already exist for some of these functions in the Arabic Academy, the annual congresses of Egyptian, Syrian and Iraqi doctors, and the ex change of educational missions. In this field there are com paratively few hindrances to unification. (b) Economic federation and the removal of tariff barriers between the Arab States are universally advocated, but little has been done to realize these aims in practice. Arab national ists, with some show of reason, usually impute this failure to the economic interests of outside parties, especially in the mandated territories. But serious difficulties have been raised, and are likely to be perpetuated, by the policy of protecting local economic interests and by the large proportion of local revenues which is derived from customs duties. One method of side tracking these difficulties would be to devise joint schemes for development, marketing, currency, banking and the like. Such a functional approach would have, from the nationalist point of view, the further advantage of drawing closer the relations between Egypt and the other Arab States. (c) The military union of Arab Asia for common defence plays a very large part in nationalist schemes. But here too no effective steps have been taken towards unification of the regional armies and of strategic policy, and the main obstacles are the same as those which have hindered the progress of con stitutional federation. Rival dynastic systems and territorial 4 am Bet wai wai / Tr&lt; Ap uni ind to t hi s tha Tr; Ar Ar Le ble coi tio pri tw alt Sy po th&lt; otl •* str th&lt; m; . lor • wi a ' ho un Ar an5 ambitions are still strongly resistant to the ideal of unity. Between 1918 and 1930 there was a well-nigh constant state of war within Arabia and along its northern frontiers, and in 1934 war broke out again between Saudi Arabia and Yemen. Arab nationalists have, however, hailed the Saudi-Iraqi Treaty of Arab Brotherhood and Alliance, signed on the 2nd April, 1936, as a first step towards a closer political and military union. By Article 6 of this Treaty it was left open to ‘any other independent Arab State’ (Yemen being specifically mentioned) to a^ere to the Alliance. The Imam of Yemen in fact gave his aancsion on the 29th April, 1937, and it was clearly intended that in due course Syria (including, if possible, Palestine and Transjordan) should join in, and perhaps also Egypt. 5 . The Stability of a Federal Union The cohesion of any federal structure that might be set up in Arab Asia would largely depend upon the skill displayed by the Arab leaders in counteracting the internal factors of disruption. Leaving aside the Zionist question, the two outstanding pro blems are the rivalry of the Saudi and Hashimid families and communal antagonisms. Both of these are most acute in rela tion to Syria. The installation of either a Saudi or a Hashimid prince in Syria would upset the present balance between the two houses, but there is no obvious third choice as yet and the alternative of a Syrian Republic, though desired by some Syrian parties, offers peculiar difficulties. In addition to possible rivalry over Syria, the expulsion of the Hashimids from the Hejaz in 1925 by Ibn Sand is not yet a closed question. The communal problem is more acute in Syria than in the other Arab countries because of the relatively greater numerical strength, as well as economic, political and cultural progress of the ‘minorities’ (taken as a whole) as against the Sunni Moslem majority; and also because of the separatism resulting from a long tradition of autonomy won and held by force of arms. The question of stability is thus bound up in the first instance with the problem of a Syrian settlement, not in isolation, but in a constructive relation to the other Arab units. Behind this, however, lie the still unconsidered problems of co-ordinating units in such different stages of development as Syria, Iraq and Arabia, and the linking-up of a pastoral with an agricultural and industrial economy.6 / 6 . Relations with Great Britain and other Powers (i) Great Britain The basis of British relations with the Arab States — again exclusive of Palestine — has been to form alliances by which, in return for the right to protect the essential British interests of communications and oil-supply, Great Britain undertakes in effect to protect them from external aggression. Granted a settlement of the status of Syria and Palestine, there appears to be no reason why such a relationship, based on mutual interest, should not continue. This will involve, h&lt;r* ver, something more than a passive attitude towards the internal development of the Arab countries. The problems with which the Arab leaders are confronted in building up any common economic or political organization in the Arab lands, and in relating their interests to those of other countries in the post-war world, are beyond their power to solve unaided. They need a friendly Power to stand by to give disinterested help and encouragement and even, if necessary, to take the initiative in a tactful way. (ii) France It is probable also that relations with France would be maintained, but upon similiar conditionsi that a settlement is reached in Syria, that French support is given disinterestedly, and that French hostility to the idea of Arab union is abandoned. Above all, the pre-war rivalry of France and Great Britain must be avoided. The long tradition of French culture and French law, especially in Syria and Egypt, opens up particularly important fields of co-operation, which will, however, call for very flexible handling. (iii) (iii) Turkey and Iran Provided that no political disputes disturb the relations between the Arab States and Turkey and Iran, the natural trend of development would be towards increasing association between them, especially in the economic field, in communica tions and in technical services. Iraq is already linked to both by the Saadabad Pact of Friendship, which was intended to lay the foundations for a more extensive collaboration in the future. There are, however, two more immediate issues which may produce tension between them. These are {a) the status of the Sanjaq of Alexandretta, whose detachment from Syria and7 annexation to Turkey in 1939 is a sore point with Arab nationalists, and {b) the future of the Kurds, who are now distributed between Turkey, Iran, Iraq and the Syrian Jazira. 7 . THE JEWISH NATIONAL HOME There is no incompatibility in principle between support for a movement in the direction of Arab federation and the fulfilment of the obligations assumed in 1917 towards the Jewish people. Responsible Zionist leaders, including Dr. W^mann himself, have publicly declared their support for the policy of Arab federation and for the integration of the Jewish National Home into such a system. The leaders who take this view are in general those who in 1937 supported the plan to partition Palestine. They favour federation now because they hope that it would confer upon the Jewish National Home at least the same advantages — the title of a State, with extensive powers over an area not less than that suggested by the Peel Commission. On the other hand, those Zionists, notably some of the Labour leaders in Palestine, who opposed partition would probably also resist a federal solution of this kind. And the hope of gaining assent to larger demands is growing in Zionist minds with the increasing implication in the war of the U.S.A. Arab nationalists, while in general prepared to accept the existence of the National Home, think in terms not of partition but of cantonization. They have frequently expressed their willingness to grant an appreciable degree of local autonomy to those districts which are already predominantly Jewish, and to embody guarantees for these and other rights in a Treaty with Great Britain. They are not willing to concede to the Jewish National Home either political control over areas at present predominantly Arab, or a status which would enable it to pursue an independent diplomacy. These differences, with the critical question of Jewish immigration looming behind them, would perhaps form insuperable obstacles to an agreement directly negotiated between representatives of the two peoples. But if it became possible for the British Government, either alone or in associa tion with other Governments, to initiate negotiations on the future of the National Home as an integral part of discussions directed towards a comprehensive settlement in greater Syria, the chances of reconciling Arab and Jewish claims would be immensely improved.'ze i; TO BE K EPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.

My Lord, Enclosure I have the honour to transmit to you a Memorandum on Arab Affairs submitted to me on 3rd October by Mr. George Antoni us* It Is, I think, worth while to recount its genesis* 2* Mr. Antonius came to see me on 25th September and I quote the following from my note of the interview:- “Mr. Antonius referred to conversations which he had previously had with me about the future of the Arabs. His ideas had then been nebulous and indeterminate. They were now crystallsing* He felt it v/ould be a good thing - indeed essential ~ that His Majesty* s Government should formulate, in a comprehensive memorandum virritten ad hoc, their policy regarding the future of the Arab world as a counterblast to the propaganda and promises which were being disseminated by the enemy® I said that (a) there was no mystery about His Majesty’s Government’s standpoint, but I # agreed there might be a case for suggesting the compilation by His Majesty’s Government of a comprehensive memorandum to re-state it in authoritative and concise terms® Nevertheless, (b) though Mr. Antonius visualised the Arab world as a single whole, it must be remembered that in many obvious respects it was not so at the present and His Majesty’s Government had to deal with things as they were and not as they might be« Any statement made v/ould have to take account of this fact* Mr. Antonius said that (a) he strongly favoured the idea of a comprehensive memorandum, though he would revert later to the question of the method of its preparation® He had not in mind the making of new promises or any more 'McMahon letters', but rather a clear recapitulation of policy; (b) he agreed that there were differentiations and discrepancies, but there were also common factors. I said that I assumed (from his previous conversations) that he had in mind such matters as education policy, customs restrictions, social services, etc., which might be susceptible of co-ordination, but that in the political field I saw difficulties'. 3. I described some of these difficulties as I saw them, and a discussion of the meaning of the term 'federation' The Right Honourable The Lord Lloyd of Dolobran, P.C., G.C.S.I., G.G.Ioli., etc., His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for the Colonies.'federation** followed (op* paragraph 8 of the Memorandum)* 'We then', to. continue quotation from my note* ’’reverted to the question of the memorandum, or statement of policy, alluded to earlier in the conversation* Mr# Antonius said that instead of this 'being compiled, e*g* in the Foreign Office, he suggested he might compile it himself and that it might be then sent to His Majesty’s Government s representatives in various Arab States* He asked my advice about this* I said that until I knew what would 'be its contents I could not say how His Majesty's Government would regard it or what they would do with it* Did Mr* Antonius envisage a memorandum as from himself individually, or one compiled in collaboration with others? He said that the latter would involve consultations with people in Egypt, Syria, Iraq, etc*, which would mean squabbles and delays* He thought in terms of a memorandum under his own name. I said that I felt sure the Secretary of State would welcome any contribution from him if it avoided too much controversial recrimination, and was directed to constructive purposes* Whether it would be circulated to His Majesty's representatives and, if so, with what instructions as to the use to be made of it, I could not say, but I thought that a really thoughtful constructive essay of the kind he'had in mind, would almost certainly be utilised, and might even form the basis for some authoritative statement* I went on to say that I would gladly do anything I properly cobld to help Mr. Antoniua unofficially in the preparation of his memorandum, e.g* by suggesting corrections in matters of fact that might be within my knowledge, or in warning him off lines which might cause offence, if he cared to show me what he had written in draft; and he would of course be as entirely free to accept or reject my advice as I should be to make any comments in forwarding the document* He expressed his gratitude for this offer and said he would get to work at once as he had plenty of time on his hands and a strong inclination to do something helpful** • 4. The present Memorandum was brought to me in draft form by Mr. Ajitonlus on October 2nd and I went through it with him in the course of an interview lasting an hour and a half that evening. As a result he made a few minor alterations, to which I will allude, and sent the Memorandum to me in its present final form the next day, 5* (a) My first criticism had been that it v/as not quite clear whether the opinions expressed in paragraphs 2 to 4 were shared by himself or represented an objective description of the opinions of others. He said the latter was the case; but he avoided any 'disasoociation of himself from them. He has now, in the second part of paragraph 2, replaced 'at heart equally imperialistic” by 'from our point of view equally imperialistic”, and 'Arab rights’* by 'our rights'. (b) Since I queried the likelihood of Germany being content with 'economic privileges' (see third part of paragraphIparagraph 2), he has added 'oil concessions and'&gt; since he regards the control of the oil supply as being a primary objective* (c) I had also asked l.$r&lt;» Antonlus to explain more fully his intentions regarding the 'creation in some suitable centre in the Arab world of a political bureau' ( paragraph 6 of the Memorandum)* He at once said that he meant a British bureau* and he has added this to the final draft, both in paragraph 6 and in paragraph 10* (d) In his paragraph 7 he had first written of the fundamental aims of the Arab national movement as being “Unity, Independence, Cultural and Economic Solidarity'® I suggested the dangers of .over-generalisation and the use of cliches without definition, adding that these four alma might not all be equally applicable to the cases of all the States in mind* Mr® Antonius has nownritten “Independence and Unity, and their corollary trends towards Cultural and Economic Solidarity'® This does not seem to me to remove my initial criticism- * ♦ 7* As regards the special British bureau of paragraph 10 of the Memorandum, I had some difficulty in elucidating Mr® Antoniue^ precise objective, but I gathered that it lay in the desire to enlist in the service of pan-Arabism a selected body of British officers and officials somewhat on the lines of the Arab Bureau of tho last War* I asked Y/hether he did not think that, so far as Palestine was concerned, its functions would tend to overlap, e*g®, with my own, but he decried tho idea® The suggestion in its present form seems to me to pre-suppose the existence of a united Arab world and a recognition of their claims to unity, independence, etc® (see paragraph 5(d) above); nor does it take into sufficient account the difference between ti.v&gt; circumstances of 1915-1918 in tho Arab world and those of 1940® 8®. My more general criticisms of Mr* Antonius^ Memorandum may be summarised as follows:** (a) He assumes a unity of thought motive and purpose in the “Arab' world, and ignores the discrepancies which exist both in those respects and in the political circumstances of the various States; and he would like to see His Majesty’s Government undertake the task of unification v^hich has so far baffled the “Arab' politicians themselves*(“b) He ignores the immsense debt which the ’’Arab world already owes to Great Britain© Had we broken up and destroyed an Arah Empire and then proceeded to oppress its disjecta membra for our ow i selfish purposes* the background* of the Memorandum would be more in keeping with the attitude of mind implicit in it as exemplified by such phrases as ’’bitterness and resentment caused b?/ the errors of the past ”© (c) He ignoi’es the Jewish problem entirely* ana this lends a certain touch of unreality to the proposals read as a whole© Had some statement been included evincing the least realisation of the existence of the problem^ and offering any more or less reasonable suggestions for its solution or mitigation* the Memorandum would have gained in content and sincerity© As it is* it suffers from a touch of intellectual dishonesty^ coupled, perhaps* with a certain lack of courage? neither is deliberate nor* I think* realised by the writer himself* The fact remains that the Memorandum is more of an essay by an ambitious writer* than a xziece of constructive statesmanship 9© Hone the less the Memorandum is e thoughtful one* representing &amp; sincere* if somewhat nebulous* desire for constructive achievement* and you may be willing to give it the wider circulation for which* as I have remarked in paragraph 3 above* its author certainly hopes© In an^ case I am confident that Mr© Antonius would greatly appreciate an expression of your interest in his suggestions and appreciation of the spirit prompting their submissions I have, etc** (Signed) Harold HacMichael* HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR PALESTINE.confidential Sir, Jerusalem* 3rd October*1940c In continuation of our recent conversation I have the honour to submit the accompanying Memorandum on ^rab affairs* which I ,haVe drawn up on my own initiative in the belief that the public interest demands it? I should like the Memorandum and the suggestions it contains to be read as being no more than an individual contribution from a student of Arab .affairs who believes in the value of AnArab collaboration and is anxious to contribute what snare he can to the furtherance of such collaboration, not only for its own sake but also as a means towards the upholding of those principles of freedom and^of the decencies of life* in the defence of which Great Britain is setting such a gallant example to the world© My knov/ledge of Arab affairs enables me to state, with the deepest conviction* that the Arabs are at heart as attached to those principles os any other civilised people, and that any effort that might be made to secure their collaboration in the right spirit would not be found to have been made in vain,. I am, etCc (ScU) Go Antonios His Excellency The High Commissioner for Palestine* Jerusalem^C QNFID KMTI.u, Jerusalem, 3rd October, 1940o M-EMQRAUQUM OK ARAB AFFAIRS &gt; The present moment seems opportune for a review of the state of feeling in the Arab world in regard to the issues arising out of the conflict between Great Britain and the iixis Powersu Considerable uneasiness reigns in Arab politics, circles.. In the course of the last twelve months, I have had numerous conversations with Syrian ? Lebanese;, Palestinian* IraCji and (to a lesser extent) Egyptian and Sarudi Arabian personalities; and I have found that the opinions they expressed, whatever their trend, were generally dominated by uneasy forebodings as to the future of their respective countrie8^ The fears expressed were not always the same 0 But there was among them a common denominator of apprehension* which ie all the more striking as it is grounded not only upon distrust of Italian and German assurances but also upon uncertainty as to British and French intentions in respect of the political and economic future of those countrie.3o In regard to Great Britain, the prevalent trend of opinion may roughly be summed up as follows: *11 the great powers of Europe are, from our point of view, equally imperialistico But Great Britain is on the one hand a satisfied Power, and on the other less harsh than the others in her exploitation of weaker nations and less intolerant of their national aspirations.. The blackest mark against here is Palestine, and. it is all the blacker as she does not seem able to shake off the Jewish hold upon her mandatory policy* The present composition of iCrc. Churchill’s Cabinet, with its-high percentage of proved Zionist sympathisers, ic such that due recognition of our rights and aspirations is scarcely to be expected at their handso .mother black mark against Great Britain is her pro-Turkish policy, that is to say her support in the past of the Turkish usurpation in the sanjaq of Alexandretta and her rumoured readiness to countenance Turkish designs upon Aleppo and other parts of K or them Syria in the future £ &gt; In regard to the Axis Powers, the consensus of opinion is roughly as follows: We have no love for either Germany or Italy* But there is one distinction to be drawn between the two, Italy is needy, over~populated and in her colonial methods, ruthless; her record in Libya and Abyssinia shows us clearly enough what to expect If she were to have a free hand in our countries « which God forbid * Kazl Germany is also ruthless; but, being lees in need of mass colonisation and better equipped in technique,technique^ she might content herself with oil concessione and other economic privileges (which it would pay ug to grant) and leave ua free to govern ourselves., She might even compel Italy to submit to a new order of her (Germany's) maiting in the Arab world and thus curb the excesses of unrestrained Italian coloniaation u One thing at any rate is certain, and that is that both Germany and Italy would give' very short shrift to the Jewish national home and rid us of that incubuso But as against that* what guarantees have we or can we get other than the verbal and somewhat specious assurances contained in the daily broadcasts from Berlin and Hornet These condensations of opinion do not reflect ill that is said in .^rab circles.. Here and there, and more particularly In Iraqi and Egyptian circles 9 a certain amount of imdisguised admiration of Nazi achievements and power is expressed. In others, the view is held that the natural ally of the Arabs is Great Britain and that a British victory would inevitably result in the elimination of Prance from Syria and the achievement of Arab unity in the form of Independent states (Egypt* Syria cum Palestine and Trans-Jordan Iraq, Sa'audi Arabia and Yaman) closely bound to each other and to Great Britain by treaties of alliance^ Now and again* the view is expressed that the most advantageous thing for the ,*raba would be a stalemate, leading to a sort of peace-* without-vtctory, in which neither side would be free to impose a regime of his own malting upon the .wrabs, or strong enough to ignore or over-ride .~vrab national aspirations. These views do find their way into the general stream of speculation; but they are not, in my Judgment, so widely held as to merit inclusion in a general picture of what may be regarded as the standard opinion.. 4 Other viev/s, of a still more sectional nature, are sometimes expressed,, But I am deliberately omitting tnem bedause* while they may be interesting in themselves, they cannot be regarded as indicative of the trend of a nation- vide, or even a truly national, sentiment t . One of them* however, does perhaps merit mention^ I refer to the changed attitude of a larger proportion of the Christians of the Lebanon tov-'ards a continuation of the French Mandateo The change la remarkable both for its amplitude and for the ways in which it manifests itself,- In lay circles. It takes the form of a sweeping •-jondemnation of Franks fitness to rule,. InIn ecclesiastical Maronite circles* it expresses itself in surreptitious attempts to effect a rapprochement with Italy* Yet the change should not be mistaken for a new manifestation of the national sentiment. Its main significance is that it affords another example of the waywardness of the Christians of the Lebanon who, bo they laymen or clerics, are primarily guided by self-interest rather than by a philosophy of adherence to the tenets of a national political creed* bo The standard opinion is, I believe, as accurately represented in the condensations given in paragraph 2 above as may be expected from so compressed a generalisation. The picture is such as to cause concern to all those who desire an Anglo-Arab understanding and believe in the fruitfulness of Anglo**Arab collaboration. The next step must be to examine the ways and means in which that body of opinion might be appealed to and influenced in ouch a manner as to make it of its own accord veer in the direction of an Anglo-Arab understanding* It is because of ray belief in the desirability and the feasibility of such a consummation that I venture to advocate it in the present memorandum, in a form which must of necessity be somewhat sketchy and tentative. 6* The measures which I would advocate as being necessary are of three kinds* One would be a public declaration by the British Government* The other, a series of political measures to be taken by the Palestine Government* The third, the creation in some suitable centre in the Arab world of a British political bureau* 7, With regard to the first, the declaration should consist of an enunciation of principles defining the attitude of the British Government towards Arab national alms* It need not be - in fact, it seems preferable that it should not be - given out as the result of Anglo-Arab negotiations, but should rather take the form of a spontaneous and unilateral declaration* It should mention the fundamental aims of the Arab national movement - namely Independence and Unity, end their corollary trends towards Cultural and Kconomic solidarity - and express as great a measure of sympathy with and support of those aims as the British Government may feel and want to give, without however going into questions affecting the ultimate political structure of the Arab States, e.g* Federation, Zollvereln, Einplre and so forth* It should contain some positive assurance that the British Government realise the harm caused by artificial frontiers arbitrarily drawn across lines of natural and economic inter course , and that they would use their influence to secure their abolition if such be the desire of the populations concerned. It should avoid all appearance of laying down a policy for all or any of the Arab States to follow, especially in regard to those points which might impinge on the sovereignty of each State; but should rather stress on the one hand the determination of the British Government to leave it to the Arabs themeelveo after the war to choose theirowa forma of government, and, on the other, their readiness to co-operate with the Arab statesln the building up of a new order baaed upon ^the broad principle® enunciated in the de'clarationr Q* It v/ould be well to explain the reasons which have led me to recommend that no commitment be entered into with regard to an Arab Federation or any altemativ inter-state system. In the first place, a commitment on that point would be premature and might prove embarrassing. In the second place, there is a great diversity as well as a certain nebulousness of opinion among Arab leaders as to the ultimate structure of that system. And lastly, it is a mistake to think that the federative or the imperial concept is necessarily on of the fundamental aims of the Arab national movement. The mistake is largely due to mistranslation, that is to say, to the rendering of the expression Al-^wahda al- * arabiya into ’'Arab Federation' 1 . The English phrase is not a true rendering of the Arabic expression which, in fact, means 'Arab Unity' (in the sense of Oneness) and no more. When Arabs speak of e l- wahd a al~ * ar ably a , they have in mind a somewhat looser association ot separate states than is conveyed hy the terra Federation, an association which is to be achieved, first by the attainment of independence and the removal of artificial (s£* imposed) frontiers and divisions, then by the strengthening of cultural and economic ties, and lastly, in some more or less immediate future, by the conclusion of such political conventions between the separate independent Arab States as time and trial may show to be in the best interests of the collective family of Arabic-speaking peoples. The conventions now in force in Iraq, Sa J udi Arabia and Y^nan are examples in point, and their conclusion is universally regarded in the Arab world as a substantial re alias tism of the ideal of al~wahda al-*arablya . 9. With regard to the second, that is to say to the measures to be taken by the Palestine Government, I would advocate (a) the speeding up of the liberation of the remaining political internees; (h) the raising of the ban on the entry into Palestine of the remaining members of the Higher Arab Committee and of other political exiles; (c) the early enactment of measures to give effectto the constitutional and administrative changes on the lines of the White Paper of May 18, 1939., 10, With regard to the third, I am of opinion that there is a pressing need for the creation of a special British bureau in the Middle East, whose main functions would be to attend to political and economic problems in the Arabic- speaking countrieso The most suitable location for the bureau would seem to be Cairo* but it should have branches in Jerusalem and Bagdad, and possibly in Jedda and Aden P and a liaison agency in Whitehall., The head of the bureau should be a personality of seme standing to whom a high military rank might be given* and he would have to assist him a small staff of carefully selected men who have experience of Arab problems and contacts in the Arab world. One of the functions of the bureau would be to establish close and y/idespread contact with persons of all shades of opinion in the Arab world* with a view to keeping its pulse on the movements of ideas, the reactions to military events and to Axis propaganda, the hardships caused by economic dislocation and the underlying grounds of discontent. Another function would be to put the knowledge thus collected to good use by studying possible remedies and devising practical suggestions* Although such functions are as a matter of course being discharged by the appropriate official agencies in each of the Arab countries, yet there is need of an ad hoc agency specially equipped to attend to the problems as a whole with single-minded concentration* and to discharge the essential task of centralising* pooling and collating all the relevant information with a view to following it up with comprehensive recommendations as to the.action required. lie Much could be written in amplification and justification of the above proposals* But I do not feel that there is need for me to labour the point 3 Anyone conversant with the real state of feeling in the Arab world must realise (a) that* notwithstanding the bitterness and resentment caused by the errors of the past and by the policy adopted in Palestine, there are throughout the Arab world an underlying preference for Great Britain as a partner and a willing recognition of the benefits that have secured to the Arab countries from their past association with her; (b) that the prestige achieved by Nazi successes and the impression made by the daily blandish ments of Axis propaganda have gone a long way towards shaking Arab confidence in the invincibility of the British Empire, and in Prance’s and Great Britain's willingness and capacity to collaborate with the Arabs in the fulfilment of their remaining national aspirati ons; (c) that the silence'maintained by the British Government and their apparent passivity in regard to present Arab hopes and anxieties are being misunderstood by the Arabs end exploitedexploited by the ; Axie, to the obvious detriment of that measure of understanding and go* operation which should reign and could be made to reign between Great Britain and the Arab world; (d) that the time has come when action to remedy the present state of affaire should no longer be delayed; (e) that this state of affairs cannot be cured by words alone; but that, alongside of a public enunciation of the principles of their policy, the British Government should take action, partly of a kind to ease the present discontent over Palestine, and partly of a kind to provide for © closer contact with and a speedier attention to the movement of ideas which the fortunes of war are bound to set into motion in the Arab world* f 12o The present memorandum is the fruit of my own study of the situation, and I alone am responsible for Its contentSo It has no other value than that of an individual contributioru Although I have no representative status whatever, I feel confident that my analysis of the prevailing currents of opinion and the suggestions, I have ventured to maxe would find general acceptance in thoughtful and responsible Arab circles* My proposals are of course not intended as a panacea to cure every sort of discontents But I believe that the adoption of the first two (namely the declaration policy and the measures in Palestine) would have an immediate and favourable effect, and that the adoption of the third proposal (special bureau) would ensure the keeping of a close watch and the initiation of constructive measures to bring the idea of Anglo«Arab understanding to ultimate frui tion* (Intld) G&lt;,A„TO BE KEPT UNDER LOOK AND KEY, II Is requested that special care may be takm t* insure the secrecy of this document.

After a short discussion the Meeting agreed as follows (l) -The Foreign Secretary was invited to reply to the prime Minister’s Minute on the following lines (a) A scheme of Arab federation had considerable attractions and, if feasible seemed to offer great advantages from the point of view of a solution of the Palestine problem. (b) A scheme of federation in the form set out by Sir Firozkhan Noon must be regarded as impracticable. (c) Any scheme of federation would probably be found to be attended by considerable difficulties, but it had been agreed that the whole matter should be fully examined by representatives of the Departments concerned. Until this exai'aination had been carried out, and a decision had been reached as to the most promising lines on which to proceed, it would be undesirable to take steps to sound the various parties concerned. (d) It was clear that we could not force the various Arab States into federation. ( 2 ) The Middle East Official Committee was invited to examine forthwith the various forms which a scheme of Arab federation might take, and to report on their advantages and disadvantages and their practicability. In making this examination the Committee would pay special regard to the help which such a scheme would afford to a solution of the Palestine problem.JTHIS HOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT EASTERN (General). CONFIDENTIAL. (15727) [E 6357/6/31] Sept ember 28. 1939. Section 3. Copy No. Memorandum respecting Arab Federation. THE independent States which are commonly called the Arab States aie Egypt. Iraq, Saudi Arabia and the Yemen, the first and second of these foui being allies of the United Kingdom. To these must be added S\ua, Lebanon and Transjordan, which are administered by their own Governments under the guidance of a mandatory Power (I ranee in the first two cases and the United Kingdom in the third),'Palestine, which is directly governed by a mandatory Power (the United Kingdom), the British Colony and British Protectorate of Aden, the British-protected States of Koweit, Bahrein, Qatai, Kalba and the six Trucial Sheikhdoms, and Muscat, which is juridically entirely independent, but in practice subject to a considerable degree of British influence. To make the picture absolutely complete, mention must be made of the Kuria Muria Islands, which are British territory, and certain islands in the Red Sea of which the sovereignty is at present indeterminate. The inhabitants of Tripolitana, which is part of the Italian Empire, and other territories of North Africa are sometimes referred to as Arabs, but the fate of these countries lies outside the scope of the present memorandum. So does the Sudan, which is under the condominium of Great Britain and Egypt, for, although Arabic is spoken there, it cannot be called an Arab country. 2. It is doubtful whether even the most enthusiastic pan-Arabs regard the union of all the Arab countries in Asia, together with Egypt, in a single empire or federation as anything but a distant dream, although now that wireless and the motor car have solved many problems of distance and communication, and the discovery of oil has gone a long way towards solving the problem of finance, there is no intrinsic reason why the whole of the Arabian Peninsula as far north as the Anatolian and Iranian plateaux should not amalgamate into a single political unit. Egypt would always be likely to remain apart, although in the past it has on more than one occasion formed a part of great empires which embraced Syria, Mesopotamia and parts at any rate of the Arabian Peninsula. 3. Pan-Arabs usually begin with more modest schemes, and these schemes usually contemplate— (a) The federation of Syria and Iraq (this was the form of federation most discussed in earlier years, a common idea being that there should be a dual monarchy under the King of Iraq); (b) The federation of Syria (and possibly the Lebanon), Palestine and Transjordan; or (c) The federation of Palestine, Transjordan and Iraq (this has been advocated by General Nuri-al-Said, the present Prime Minister of Iraq). 4. The idea of closer union of one kind or another among the Arab States on the lines of one of these three schemes, or even on more ambitious lines, has at first sight much to recommend it, and must seem especially natural to those older men who remember the days when they all belonged to one country, even though that country was under alien rule. For instance, Palestine and Trans jordan are geographically, economically and strategically somewhat unnatural entities, which only exist as the result of external support. The same is true of Syria and the Lebanon. The four territories are geographically a single area and some kind of union between them ought to increase the prosperity of each of the four. Some kind of union between Iraq and Syria (especially if Syria were enlarged by the addition of the Lebanon), Palestine and Transjordan would also be natural On the other hand, any kind of union between Iraq, Transjordan2 and Palestine, without Syria, would not be very natural. In short, there ts nothing inherently permanent about most of the present boundaries of the Arab countries Apart from Egypt, and to a lesser extent Iraq, few of them correspond to natural geographical or economic divisions. A tendency to rearrange their political divisions and groupings in future years is only, therefore, to be expected. 5. Small States find it increasingly difficult, moreover, in the world of to-day, to maintain their independence. Directly or indirectly they must rely upon the aid and support of some more powerful neighbour. A single large State could aspire with greater prospects of success to independence in the fullest sense of the word. 6. Finally, there is throughout the Arab countries, including even kgypt, a common language (despite local forms and dialects), for the great majority, except in the Lebanon, a common religion (which upon the whole transcends sectional differences) and a common culture (all allowance made for vast differences in development, education and sophistication). It would be tempting to add that there was a common racial origin, but there is probably nothing of the kind. On the other hand, Sunni Arabs regard themselves as forming one large community, and, whether this sentiment is scientifically justifiable or not, they are in consequence the main standard-bearers of pan-Arab ideals. 7. As a result of these factors, of more extensive education and of easier communications, there is unquestionably a growing sense of solidarity among the Arab peoples. This sense of solidarity has been intensified in the case of Iraq, Syria and Palestine by the struggles of each country to gain its independence. It may also have been exploited by political leaders for reasons of their own, and it has unquestionably been stimulated enormously in all Arab countries by the troubles in Palestine. But many national movements have been similarly exploited and stimulated and are none the less real on that account. In the case of the Arabs this sense of solidarity may ultimately overcome, at any rate temporarily, the personal jealousies of their rulers and politicians, as well as narrower focal patriotisms, just as German nationalism eventually led to the German Empire and the Third Reich, despite the opposition of the German princes and Austrian politicians. 8. But meanwhile all such ideas are beset by formidable obstacles, which may be classified as the divergent interests of— (a) The rulers of the various States, (b) France, (c) Turkey, and (d) Great Britain. 9. The jealousies among the rulers are intense. The strongest and most influential man among them is Ibn Baud, although his territory is one of the most backward and, until its oil and gold resources can be developed, certainly also the poorest. He is determined that, if there is to be any outstanding leader among the Arabs, it shall be himself and no one else. He is particularly jealous of the Hashimite family, which formerly ruled in the Hejaz and is now represented in Iraq and Transjordan, and the prospect of either the young King Feisal II or the Emir Abdullah extending his rule over Syria or Palestine appears to Ibn Saud as a direct threat to his interests. The Royal families in Iraq and Transjordan no doubt repay his dislike with interest. Moreover, the Emir Abdullah and his relations in Iraq are rivals in various matters, especially that of the nebulous throne of Syria. Another aspirant to leadership in the Arab and indeed the Moslem world is King Farouk of Egypt, whose ambitions in the direction of the Caliphate have already made him suspect to Ibn Saud at least. The Imam Yahya of the Yemen is an old man to whom suspicion is second nature and the mere suggestion of dependence or subordination an outrage. Even the little sheikhs of the Aden Protectorate and the Persian Gulf, although they may not like British control for its own sake, prefer it to absorption by stronger neighbours. 10. The jealousies of the Arab rulers are reflected, though less strongly, in their Governments. The Ministers and officials composing the Administration of such a country as Iraq are like Ministers and officials elsewhere, in that they try to make the best political and economic bargains they can for the community which they represent, without letting sentimental ideas about Arab brotherhood3 interfere over much with their aims or reflecting too closely upon the precise composition of that community For instance, the Sunni element, to which allusion has already been made, is actually outnumbered in Iraq by the Shiah Arabs and the Kurds, although it is politically predominant. Moreover, Arab brotherhood is soon forgotten whenever the Iraqi Government, for example, employ a Syrian or a Palestinian or an Egyptian for a post which an Iraqi thinks he himself could fill. Again, there is a genuine national sentiment at least in Egypt and, of recent years, in Iraq. In the other Arab countries national feeling in the wider sense can hardly exist. An Arab from Damascus, or the Hejaz, or the Hadramaut may and probably does have a fellow-feeling for those of the same local origin as himself, and a feeling of loyalty—if he is a tribesman—for his tribal chief. But it is unlikely that his emotions are profoundly stirred by the Republic of Syria, or the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia or the Sultanate of Shi hr and Mukalln. 11. Finally, whatever the wishes of the Arabs may be (and notwithstanding the fact that a single large State or federation might, as already suggested, be better able to stand on its own feet than a number of-small ones), the difficulties inherent in administering such a large, sparsely populated and backward country, in which Iraqis, for instance, will still look on Syrians as effete and Syrians still look on Iraqis as boors, make it most unlikely that even a single Arab State or union of Arab States could, at any rate for a long time to come, dispense with friendly help and support from outside. In fact, the best advice which sympathisers with pan-Arabism can give to its supporters is that each Arab State should first learn how to become strong and prosperous, so that it can bring strength and prosperity to the eventual federation, instead of weakness and poverty. 12. The French attitude towards Arab federation and a fortiori towards any closer form of union has been expressed emphatically and categorically on many occasions^ 1 ) The French Government are definitely and implacably opposed to it as something which may weaken their position in Syria and even in the Lebanon. They maintain that it is in the interest of both Great Britain and France to stabilise as soon as possible the existing situation in the Arab world. Why the French Government attach so much importance to their position in the Middle East is not always easy to understand. The retention of Syria and the Lebanon under mandate cannot be of any particular advantage economically, except in so far as it provides employment for a number of French officials. Although use is often made of the argument that it is cheaper to maintain troops in the mandated territories than in France, the defence of territories so remote from other French territories must on the whole be an anxiety and a commitment rather than a source of strength. The reason is, no doubt, partly to be found in the historic cultural connexion of France with the Levant and in memories of the French role of protector of the Christians in the East: in fact, a matter of pride and prestige, rather than of solid benefit. 13. Jealousy of Great Britain also plays its part in deciding the French attitude. Since the area in the Middle East where British influence is predominant is much larger than the area under French control, and since, more over, His Majesty's Government have always been regarded as more sympathetic than the French Government to Arab aspirations, it is assumed in France that French influence in a united Arab State or federation would be much less powerful than British influence. Any sympathy shown by His Majesty’s Government for pan-Arab aspirations is consequently not regarded as being wholly disinterested, and, in so far as it is considered to be a subtle attempt on the part of His Majesty’s Government to rob France of her share in the spoils of the last war, it causes considerable resentment. 14. In any case, the France of to-day is determined to maintain an effective hold upon Syria and the Lebanon, whatever their precise status may be, and. if there is one part of the Avorld more than another where French Governments and officials have in the past been suspicious and resentful of British rivalry and where even to-day His Majesty’s Government must pay more than ordinary regard to French susceptibilities, it is here. 15. There is not much that can be said about the position of Turkey. The Turkish Government have repeatedly declared that they harbour no territorial C) See annex for some examples. [705 ee—3] B 24 ambitions. But there are many people who refuse to believe this, especial!) since the absorption of the Malay (the Sanjak of Alexandretta), and these people maintain that sooner or later Turkey will take steps to obtain control of ..Ueppo and Mosul, if not of areas further south. Although it is unlikely that Turkey will take these steps so long as her political interests tie her to Great Britain and France, the existence of latent ambitions of this kind is probable enough. If these latent ambitions do exist, an Arab federation might, indeed, appear to Turkish eyes as a prospective obstacle to Turkish interests, although it would be difficult for the Turkish Government to say this openly. 16. There remains to be considered the position of Great Britain. His Majesty’s Government are sometimes exhorted to have a “ comprehensive policy for the Middle East( 2 ) and to formulate and pursue this policy on a “ long view.” This is admirable advice, but of a kind which it is seldom possible to follow effectively in practice. There may be an “ ideal Middle East, a grouping of States or political systems which would suit British interests better than any other. But it would' be difficult to find any two persons to agree on what form this ideal should take and even if the ideal were self-evident it would probably be most difficult, if not impossible, to bring it into being. For the purposes of day- to-day diplomacy it is necessary to be less ambitious, to take the Middle East as it is and to endeavour to addpt the existing scheme of things to the more obvious needs of British Imperial policy. 17. The fundamental British interests in the Middle East are, as it happens, well defined. They are communications and oil. Great Britain has two main lines of communication from the Mediterranean to India, Australia and the Far East. The first, which is primarily a sea route, runs through the Suez Canal and the Red Sea to the Indian Ocean; the second, which is primarily an air route, runs from the Mediterranean coast, through Palestine, Transjordan and Iraq, to the Persian Gulf and thence down its Avestern shore to the Indian Ocean. The principal sources of oil are Persia (Iran) and Iraq, with Bahrein and Saudi Arabia making rapid progress. The Persian oil is shipped by way of the Persian Gulf. The Iraqi oil is shipped from Tripoli and Haifa, on the Mediterranean coast. In years to come increases in the range of aircraft, the discovery of oil in large or larger quantities in the United Kingdom or Canada or other develop ments may alter the strategic basis of the British Empire and make it possible for British policy to be less concerned with developments in the Middle East. But, until that day comes, Great Britain must in some form or other—not necessarily the precise form of to-day—conduct her relations with the Middle Eastern countries, through varying degrees of protection, influence, alliance and friend ship, so as to ensure that her essential interests shall continue. In particular she must maintain effective control, whether direct or indirect, of certain vital points like Haifa, the Suez Canal, Aden, the Persian Gulf and the Basra-Haifa air route, and she would not care to see any European Power less friendly than France established in Syria and the Lebanon. 18. Judging their needs by this standard, His Majesty’s Government do know fairly AA^ell what they Avant from each of the Arab countries; and, in spite of German and Italian rivalry and an unpopular policy in Palestine, they haA^e con trived until noAv to maintain their position as the predominant Power in the Middle East. It is impossible in pursuing any policy, “ consistent ” or otherAvise, to please all the Middle Eastern countries and peoples equally. When one can only be pleased at the cost of displeasing another, all that can be done is to balance the major against the minor interest. 19. How then, in the light of all this, ought His Majesty’s Government to regard the question of closer Arab union ? 20. It is sometimes supposed by advocates of pan-Arab ideas that Great Britain must necessarily be opposed to these ideas for much the same reasons as France opposes them, and particularly because a single State embracing all the Arab countries would not be amenable to British influence in the same wav as a number of small and weaker States. The invitations extended to the Arab States to be represented at the conferences on Palestine may haA^e shaken this belief to ( a ) This term is used here to cover the Arab countries mentioned in paragraph 1 , with the addition of Persia (Iran). It is usually held to embrace Turkey too, but Turkey lies outside the problem here under discussion. It might also be held to ?nclude Afghanistan, whose main importance is her position as a buffer between India and the Soviet Union.r 5 some extent, but there is some truth in it, and it is unlikely that His Majesty s Government would of their own accord ever wish actively to promote am encourage pan-Arab ideas, even if the attitude of the French Government lelt them free to do so, and even if their relations with the various Arab rulers were f such a kind that they could support a policy which seemed to favour one among em without causing offence to the others. 21. At the same time, as has been said in earlier paragraphs, there is nothing inherently permanent about most of the existing boundaries of the various Arab countries, while pan-Arabism is a phenomenon in the politics of the Middle East which has probably come to stay. This being so, any attempt to oppose the idea which it embodies, as opposed to any particular manifestation of that idea, or to treat it with open lack of sympathy, would be not only ineffective, but extremely unwise. His Majesty’s Government have therefore taken the line, when the question has been discussed in the past, that, while they would be unwilling to take any initiative and think that this initiative should, and must, come from the Arabs themselves, they would, if the point were to arise, endeavour to avoid displaying active opposition or open lack of sympathy, and would instead endeavour to guide the movement along lines which should ensure that the ensuing federation or union was friendly to Great Britain, these views have been expressed to the French Government on more than one occasion and they probably represent the least, and also the most, that His Majesty’s Government can decide or do for the moment. 22. This memorandum is not intended to be an exhaustive examination of the different forms which Arab union might take and somewhat vague terms have therefore purposely been used. But union can naturally take many forms, from alliances to complete amalgamations under a single administration. Iraq, Saudi Arabia and the Yemen are already parties to a Treaty of Arab Brotherhood and Alliance, which is not, in point of fact, an alliance in the true sense of the word, but a consultation pact. So far, this treaty represents almost the only step taken by the Arabs towards the realisation of pan-Arab ideas. So far as is known, no attempt has yet been made to give effect even to the limited obligations assumed under this treaty. It is not, therefore, a very long step, but it may prove the beginning of a long march. 23. In conclusion, some reference must be made to the interest which the Zionist leaders take in the question of Arab federation. It has often been suggested to His Majesty’s Government by these leaders and their sympathisers, as well as by other persons of no marked Zionist sympathies who, nevertheless, wish to find a solution of the Palestine problem, that an effort should be made to promote the union of Palestine and Transjordan with Iraq, or Syria, or both, because the Arabs of this larger State would have less objection to the immigration of Jews than the Arabs of Palestine alone; and the inducement held out to His Majesty’s Government to make this effort is that they would be laying up for themselves treasure in Heaven by earning the lasting friendship and gratitude of the Arabs. 24. It is conceivable that His Majesty’s Government might be able to win the friendship and gratitude of the Arabs in this way. But it is unlikely that any assistance given by His Majesty’s Government and the French Government to the union of the Arab States would lead the Arabs generally to agree to any really substantial increase of Jewish immigration either into Palestine or into the Arab area as a whole. 25. It is also possible that continued German or other propaganda in favour of pan-Arabism may lead to pressure being put on His Majesty's Government to declare themselves in the same sense. 26. It is hoped, however, that enough has been said in this memorandum to show that a spontaneous attempt by His Majesty’s Government to promote Arab federation, from whatever motives, would be a very risky experiment, from the point of their relations with the existing Arab countries, as well as their relations with France and possibly Turkey; and that a positive declaration on the subject should be avoided as long as possible. Changes in the Arab world are doubtless bound to come, possibly changes in the direction of closer union. The present Middle Eastern edifice is slightly ramshackle and His Majesty’s Government may sooner or later have to help in repairing it. But it will be better for them to wait until the play of natural forces has shown how theirassistance and support can most usefully be applied. To add to the present edifice a further storey, with nothing but theory for use as mortar, might merely bring it tumbling to the ground. Eastern Department, Foreign Office, September 28, 1939. Annex. The French Government have always been opposed to any idea of a federation of Arab States, and have on many occasions made their views known to His Majesty’s Government. In a memorandum referring to the Peel Commission report of July 1937 the French Ambassador drew attention to certain points in it which seemed to indicate that federation was a possible solution. He pointed out that such suggestions tended to encourage pan-Arab aspirations and had a disturbing effect on the situation in Syria. He urged that it would be to the interest both of Great Britain and France to stabilise as soon as possible the existing situation in the Arab world. The French Government themselves were doing their best to stabilise Syria. In October 1938, before the issue of the Woodhead report, the French Ambassador again spoke about allusions in the press to the idea that some form of Arab confederation might receive the blessing of His Majesty's Government. This had greatly disconcerted the French Government, who were always desirous of being of help to His Majesty’s Government in those areas. In this instance they hoped most earnestly that nothing of this nature would materialise. Their own position vis-a-vis Syria was always difficult, and any idea of a confederation could not but add to their difficulties. Even were the inclusion of Syria not contemplated—and to this the French Government attached the utmost importance—nevertheless,, such a confederation would act as a magnet and augment disquiet and agitation in Syria. Officials of the Quai d’Orsay spoke in the same sense at the same time. They explained that the French Government wish Syria and the other States to remain as individual entities within their existing frontiers; they would not favour any idea of a large conglomerate Arab State under a sort of joint Franco-British mandatory regime such as had been mooted in the British press.A10IEX III TRACT PROM A SP5&gt;J0H MAIM BY KH .

V/e have countless v/ell-v/ishers among them, as they have many friends here. Some days ago I said in the House of Commons that his Majesty’s Government had great sympathy with Syrian aspirations for independence. I should like to repeat that now. But I would go further. The Arab world has made great strides since the settlement reached at the end of the last War, and many Arab thinkers desire for the Arab peoples a greater degree of unity than they now enjoy. In reaching out towards this unity they hope for our support. No such appeal from our friends should go unanswered. It seems to me both natural and right that the cultural and economic ties between the Arab countries and the political ties too, should be strengthened. His Majesty 1 Government for their part will give their full support to any scheme that commands general approval.Annex V f T30PY. (S 4536/1730/G) FOR SIGN OFFICE , G.’/.I 19th September, 1941* MOST SECRET . Dear Boyd, Many thanks for your letter 75872/115/41, of the 7th August, in whioh you invite our comments on Sir Harold f MaoMichael 1 s telegram No* 1021, of the 13th July, and the Colonial office minutes on that telegram, about future policy in Palestine. I may say at once that there is very little, if anything, in the Colonial Office minutes with which we disagree. 17e had also reached the conclusion that there is nothing very attractive about any of Sir Harold MacHichael f s three suggestions, and that by far the better course will be to carry out the policy laid down in the White Paper of 1939. There is just one point of detail that occurs to us, notably with regard to MacMichael*8 second suggestion. We wonder whether MacMichaei is right in assuming that_ the setting up of a mixed Advisory Council, and subsequently of a mixed Legislative Council, is Inconsistent with the V/hite paper policy. The constitutional proposals to which MacMichacl refers were, of course, abandoned for good and sufficient reasons, viz. that they were discovered to be quite inadequate to meet the Arab views. The Arab delegations at the Palestine Conference made it clear that they had very little use for a mixed Advisory Council which, after all, was merely a reversion to an arrangement in force In 1920. Y/hat they wanted was what Sir Harold MacKichael calls a ’ f jobocracy*' or, in other words, posts where they would have responsibility and executive powers. It is clear that the mixed Advisory Council scheme would not satisfy the Arabs now any more than it did in 1939 as a substitute for the Y/hite Paper policy. If, however, MacMichael likes the idea of setting up a mixed Advisory Council etc., is there any reason v/hy he should not do so*? He could explain, if necessary, that this was not part of the '/bite Paper policy, but that as His Majesty^ Government have been compelled by the war to postpone temporarily the implementation of the constitutional proposals in the White Paper, he had decided to proceed with this other scheme, which did not of course mean that the -Yhite Paper plan would not also be carried out so soon as circumstances rendered this feasible. We have, however, one far more important comment. It seems to us that sir Harold MacMichael is regarding the Palestine problem as one that can still be.considered in isolation. You will remember that the Middle Bast official Committee h.B. 3oyd, Esq., C.M.G., C.V.O.Committee tr-ied to discuss the Trans-Jordan problem in isolation not long ago 9 and reached the conclusion^ vmxc.t thinlc was the right conclusion# that there was nothing maen that could he done until we had made up our minds on the wider questions of policy affecting not only Trans-Jordan# hut also Palestine# Syria and the Lebanon* e have now to consider these wider problems# taking Palestine# Trans-Jordan* Syria and the Lebanon as the unit# and trying to clear o ! -r ideas as to what the future of those territories outfit to be. V/e must try to devise some practicable ultimate aim towards which British policy should be directed. v/hen v/e know what we want, we shall have a clearer idea of what our day to day * or month to month# polioy should be# and shall be better prepared to take advantage of every opportunity that may arise to advance a step further forward in the right direction* It would# we feel# be quite wrong to imagine that consideration of future developments in these territories can safely be postponed until the end of the war. The situation is constantly changing. As you know# the abolition of the mandate covering Syria and the Lebanon has already been, proclaimed. That is a new development of the greatest importJince which is bound to have its effect upon the local attitude towards the Palestine mandate. (iii) * v . ? e have reaffirmed in general terms our sympathy with Arab Federation, without having any precise idea of how far we would be prepared to go to bring this about. At any moment we may have to consider the desirability of taking urgent action of some kind, rather than allow the situation to drift towards a recurrence of the disturbances which have caused us so much trouble in the past. It seems to us# therefore* that the moment has come to study some fundamental questions, with a view to determining our own ultimate aims in the whole area. You will no doubt be the best judge of what questions ought to be considered in this connexion, but I would suggest something on the following lines:- (a) That exactly are British and French essential requirements in the area? (b) Hoy/ can these best be reconciled with the independence which has been promised to Palestine# Syria and the Lebanon? (c) As regards the future of the Jewish National Home, what would be the relative advantages or disadvantages of the following:- (i) a Federation containing a Jewish unit (or units) and several Arab units? (ii) a Jewish independent State side by side with an Arab independent State or States? (iii) more or less permanent maintenance of direct British rule over a (Jewish) part of the area under a revised mandate or Grown Colony government?area:- (d) As regards the future of the Arab -oart of the (i) would we wish to see it more closely united than at the present, e.g* under a single Icing? (ii) would we he prepared to give it a joint Anglo- French guarantee against external aggression? (iii) would we see any objection to its being absorbed into other Arab countries, to its becoming a part of Iraq, or a part of Ibn Fauci’s dominions? (e) Would it be desirable to initiate an exchange of views with the Free French, in order to endeavour to co ordinate British and French policy in the area? Yours aincex'ely.

The Rt« Hon, The Lord Moyne of Bury St. Bdaund®, D.g.o.HQTK OH PRQ3PSCTS OF '* JV SOLUTION OP THE PAI^STINE PROBLEM. It is necessary* first# to drav/ attention to the fact that the term ”Pe derat ion 1 * has heen used p in x*elation to Pales tine ? in at least three different senses:* (a) to describe a federal system confined to Palestine and hardly distinguishable from ** cantonisation*'„ This form of federation was rejected by the Royal Commission (Chapter XXI). but a letter which the surviving members of the Committee wrote to the Times on 22*5*59* after the publication of the White Paper# shows that they thought that federation might have some chance of success if it covered a wider field; (b) to describe a wider federal system comprising all or most of the so-called 'Arab World' (Iraq# Baud! Arabia# Syria, Palestine# Trans-Jordan and at times even figypt)* This conception is one which has not infrequently been ventilated for many years past in 'Arab circles as part of their campaign for the unification of the Arab world* It received little prominence, but periodic mention# in the English parliament or press until after the White paper (published in May 1939) failed to receive the assent either of the Jews or the Arabs; (c) 'Federation' frequently appears as a mistranslation of what the 'Arabs' did in fact want# namely 'tauhid' # l 0 e. 'unification'. This does not necessarily imply a federal system at all; but 'federation' was usually the word used in English to describe the Arab aspiration. 2. I assume that 'federation' in its true sense implies, not hegemony by any one party, but a union constituted for economic*and other purposes and involving the relinquishment of certain sovereign rights by each of a number of independent states and the pooling of those rights in the hands of a federal government# with the result that a union is formed in which the several parties retain autonomy in internal administrative matters. a distinction between 'federation' of this kind, however faulty my attempted definition, and the 'unification' to which the 'Arabs' aspire. 3. The original impetus towards unification of the 'Arab world' was political in its conception and naturally came from the 'Arabs' themselves. It dates back to the period of the war of 1914-1918. For the purpose of presenting a united front and obtaining full value from H.M.G’s pledges, the 'Arabs' represented themselves as being a single race with the same ideals, having as one of their objects the consolidation of their various units into a single political whole. The acceptance of this theoretic unity would entitle all alike to claim benefit by participation in the promises of Independence which had been given. In the following paragraphs I have tried to maintain InIn fact? however'i the word M Ara■b ,, covers a number^ of un5.ts ? which? though all spealcing Arabic and all inhabiting the Middle Sast as neighbours? differ in race? in religion? in culture? in way of living? in stage of development and in political aims* Further reference is made below to these differences,, 4o But there has also been a parallel movement on the part of the Jews for the unification of the whole of the Middle tfast* Since Theodor Herzl founded the Zionist Organisation in 1897 this conception? with Palestine as the centre of the unified area? has appealed to Jewry as providing a sphere for Jewish activity and domination, and at one period or another it has received impetus from opportunities appearing to present themselves for its translation into practice* The later stages of the last war was one such opportunity* What is assumed to be the later stages of the present war is another* In each case, it has been felt, the general settlement to be reached at the Peace Conference must include a recognition of Jewish u rights” formally recognised by the victorious powers* 6* The Balfour Declaration of 1917 accorded recognition for ”a National Home for the Jewish people” in Palestine? with a reservation to safeguard the ”civil and religious rights” of the rest of the population* It is to be noted that, to quote the Royal Commission’s Report (page 40), !? In 1919? when the Covenant was signed, the vast majority of the population was Arab* It was those half million Arabs, with a small minority of 66,000 Jews? who had been removed from Turkish rifle and were now to be entrusted to Mandatory admlnietration”• There are now something over a million Arabs, of whom nearly 97,000 are Christians? and over 463,000 Jews in Palestine* These latter have built a National Home in Palestine and they are conscious of a great opportunity,about to arise for extending its sphere* Arab ”federation” is useful for this purpose* 6* Thus we have the idea of unification as canvassed by the ”Arabs” for their own reasons, concurrently taken up by the Jews, who had already thought of it? and who see in it a unique opportunity for the extension of their own influence and power* There are differences of opinion, of course, among the Jews themselves as to how beat unification may serve their ends* Some would restrict influence and power in the unified area to matters cultural and economic; some (the political Zionists in particular) would extend them to politics and Government; some would go further in the direction of compromise with His Majesty’s Government and/or the ’’Arabs” than would others; but there would, I think, be general agreement that the spread of Jewish9 = Jewish Influence-and power, whatever the de ®-i?'^unIfled would be facilitated by the provision oi a single unilieo field for their operation^ 7. The 'Arabs' are perfectly alive to the aepiratione of the Jews, and to whatever extent unification, whatever name, is favoured by the Jews j.t fj ow something of its original attractionin Arab ey , then, it may be asked, does it come about that so many irabs still regard unification with favour? 8, The answer must, I think, be given under several heads: (a) There is, in fact, a marked decline in the Arab enthusiasm for unification for the reason stated in my preceding paragraphs It la true that when, towards the close of the London discussions of 1939, it was proposed b y ^ia Majesty s Government to insert the words 'possibly of a federal nature in clause 10(l) of the White Paper, the representatives or the Arab States, then in Cairo (.the Palestine dele gat. having already dispersed), objected and asked that the words should be omitted; but the form of federation reierivd to at the time was the 'cantonal' form mentioned under U) in my first paragraph* The words were duly omitted in the,White paper but in defending it subsequently (23rd Kay 1939) in'the , House of Lords the Government spokesman specifically aaaea as the Colonial Secretary had warned the Arab States that he would « ’’There is nothing in the White Paper to rule • out the possibility of a federal solution”, and it appears from the debate that ’’federation” by now was being understood in its wider sense ((b) of paragraph 1), and it was ^ advocated in that sense by Lord Samuel* Lord heading ana the archbishop of Canterbury* Similarly in the discussions held at Geneva in June* 1939, with the Permanent Mandates Commission it became clear that, though it was only in the narrower sense that ’’federation” had been discussed with the ”rirabs” in London, the wider conception was not by any means to be ruled out of consideration^ (b) Many ’’Arabs” - I refer of course to the political intelligentsia - may feel that some unification is possible, and that it can be made an instrument for the of Jews, in spite of Jewish designs to make use of it for their own ends^ (c) A proportion of these same ’’.vrabe” do not altogether dislike the idea of Jewish permeation, because they^are shrewd enough to see that without it there will be less money in their several countries and less opportunities for profiteering in land values* ’^ hile reconciled to economic pemeation they draw the line at political domination, and thus, to whatever extent they continue to accord favour to uitfication it must understood that the term relates only in their mind to cultural and economic mattersc9* I pass now to the question whether in fact ’•federation” or political unification in any sha i )e “. the matter really at ieeue - is a practical proposition ror the 'Arab World' P In brief, X consider it little more than a chimaera, though I need hardly add, there are directions in which differences in the field of culture and economics could oe removed cr minimised^ The improbability of success for any form of political unification arisein my view, from a variety facts, which may be summarised thus:- of (a) Racialo The term 'Arab' covers such discrepant^ elements a® the nomadic Beduin of Saudi Arabia, the Euphrates, Beereheba and Tran8-Jordan, on the one hand, and the Levantines of the &amp;!editerranean seaboard on the other* and eve^ v/hen^ convenient, the Cairenes and Kellahin of iSgypto The racial ingredients of the Levantine comprise an Arab element, no douDt* but there are few Mediterranean elements unrepresented* I*' is these I^evantines, or Syrians, who are more vocal politically than all the resto (b) Reli gious * The term 'Arab' covers the Christ!^ '.Arabs' of Palestine (say 97,000) and the Lebanon and Syria* who have come into the political fold in order to preserve a united. 'Arab' front but who nervous of an 'independence” which would place oower in the hands of the large Mohammedan majority* It covers also the great rival Mohammedan groups cu Shi a and Sunni in Iraq and Syria, Alawiyin, Druze, etc- (c) National and Dynastic ^ The term 'Arab' covers the bulk of the population ruled by independent governments in Saudi Arabia, the Yemen, Iraq - and, when convenient Agypt and by Mandate in Syria, the Lebanon, Palestine and Trans-Jordan* It also covers the House of Hashim, which used tc rule the Hejaz and now controls Iraq and Trans-Jordan, and the Saudi dynasty which ejected the Hashimites from Arabia* Sach group * Iraq, Trans-Jordan, Syria, Saudi Arabia * wouid willingly accept hegemony over neighbouring countries, but none of them would care to accept the minor r$le* But If 'federation', so far from implying a hegemony, involves a voluntary surrender of sovereign rights, one can only say that this is not what the 'Arabs' intend and that sovereign rights are the last that any of the larger units would part with* It is tO:be particularly remarked that, until the recent revolution/Iraq, under the guidance of Ruri Pasha, had been the chief exponent of unificationc I have not mentioned the question of the Caliphate, which 16 apparently dormant at present, but any attempt at unTic at ion or to assume the hegemony of the 'Arab' world, would no doubt bring this vexed subjectsubject into prominence again, with Egypt and Ba^udi Arabia as the protagonists* t d ) Family. The very strongly defined family groupings to be found in Palestine and Syria (and no doubt elsewhere) seem to be purely feudal in their conception^ The big ^houses’ 1 , Uusseinis, Kashaahibis, Abdel Hadis, etc., represent the big landowners of the Turkish period, and land (in Palestine at least) has been held in ownership by suoh ever : since the fashion was set (if it did not already exist) by the Crusading barons in the twelfth centuryo The villagers were merely tenants, having no say in the administration of the country* This feudal system no doubt derived support from the tribal ideas of the Arabs of the desert, which strongly resemble those of feudalism*. The disturbances of 1938/9 demonstrated very clearly that; though the well known families have for the most part lost their ancestral possessions, the lines of cleavage were at root still due to family jealousies and vendettas rather than to politics, and that the political motif was generally imported (not as a rule without cash) to give spaciousness to the 'revolt'* (e) Political. Little need be said of the various political parties into which the 'Arab' world of Palestine, Syria and Iraq are divided. They derive their force partly from the “family' jealousies referred to under (d), and partly from the personal ambition and desire for the power of patronage which arc uniformly predominant In the East. Racial and religious differences may be tided over, national quarrels may be resolved for a time, but family feud© die very hard, and the potency of personal ambition will continue unabated so long as there is scope for it. 9. In considering the practicability of Federation, it is well to avoid assuming a unity of thought motive and purpose in the 'Arab World' at least. The medley of conflicting motives which I have tried to outline derives, it is true, a certain coherence from a common fear of the Jews, and it is easy to speak of 'Unity', 'Federation', and so on, so long as the terms remain undefined: but not even the fear of the Jews can overcome the deep seated, age-old jealousies and love of intrigue which, coupled with a frankly admitted disinclination to accept responsibility or show moral courage or self- sacrifice, will continue to keep dissension alive. Even if it were otherwise, and some measure of internal reconciliation had a chance of success, the likelihood that the path of Zionism would be smoothed by 'unification' or 'federation' would lessen the chances of a solution by that method being found acceptable^ If, nevertheless, the attempt to form a confederation were pressed by Hia Majesty’s Government, it seems fairly certain that the two main forces operating in the Middle East, namely internal dissension on the one hand and fear of the Jews on the other, would combine to defeat it. 10. I doubt, therefore, whether Federation will provide a solution for our troubles or those of the 'Arabs' or the Jews. On the contrary, it is arguable that the 'Arabs' will be more susceptible of control and less dangerous if they remain divided into the comparatively small units which time may yet demonstrate their abilityto manage decently for themselveo; that the Jews ere more likely to extend their influence hy gradual and legitimate processes in the sphere of economics and culture if they come to terms (as they can) with each unit separately and without precipitating bloodshed by attempts at political domination; and that m 9 for our part f shall find the task of furthering the good of both parties, while safeguarding our own interests, considerably eased if we retain whatever powers of control wo may now have in each unit until experience shows that we can safely leave it to its own devices- (Sgd) A* klacMichael Jerusalem, 13- 9. 41THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF pis'BRITANNIC MA^STY’S GOVERNMENT DURING the course of a conversation with the Saudi Arabian Minister this morning, his Excellency asked me whether I could give him any information about our plans for an Arab federation. He himself thought that it was desirable to work out those plans now and to consult with the chief Arab rulers—for instance, with King Ibn Saud, with Iraq and with Arabs in Syria. His Majesty’s Government had much experience in work of this kind and unless they gave a lead and helped the Arabs by offering their advice and, if possible, putting a scheme forward, it would be hardly possible to make progress. The Arabs looked to us for leadership and, if we would give it them by propounding a scheme for Arab federation, they would join with us in the fight and we could then raise Arab troops to do battle with us and there would be no such great need to bring troops from overseas to fight in the Middle East. His Excellency continued that he felt sure that Sir M. Lampson, with his experience, could help us in this work, and, since Arabs knew the interest I had always taken in the Arab world, they hoped that I would devote attention to preparing a scheme for federation. If we could work this out, we should be conferring a great boon upon the Arabs. 2. I told his Excellency that I fully understood the importance of what he had said to me, but that the task which he was setting us was an immensely formidable one. Since the days of Muhammad no one had been able to arrive at a satisfactory scheme for Arab federation. There were so many conflicting interests to be reconciled. It was not easy in war-time to find the hours necessary for the elaboration of such a scheme and for its negotiation. His Excellency replied that none the less he hoped that we would not leave this matter until after the war. The Arabs would be deeply disappointed if they thought that such was our intention. 3. The conversation was throughout most friendly and I asked the Minister to convey to King Ibn Saud my greetings and thanks for the loyal help which he had rendered us in a difficult period. Sheikh Hafiz replied that, whatever happened, we must know that we could count upon his King. WAR (General). August 15, 1941. 19 41 . CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. [E 4761/53/65] Copy No. 97 (No. 44.)

The same French officials were still in authority there. Yesterday it had been the Vichy French, now it was the Free unpopular. It was important that the Free French rule should show itself to be different from Vichy rule. I would understand that the true confidence of the Arab was reposed in the British, not in the French, whether they were Vichy or Free French. The Arabs recalled the statement I had made in my Mansion House speech, and it was in this that their confidence rested. 2. Sheikh Hafiz said that, if he might make a suggestion, he thought that General de Gaulle would much improve his position with the Arabs if in his speeches he would not always and exclusively speak of France in the Levant. He should mention the Arabs, too. He could make it plain that he understood that the inhabitants of Syria had not been happy in the last twenty years, and that now a new era was opening up during which they would live together, French and Arabs, as friends. 3. I thanked the sheikh for his advice, and said that I fully understood its wisdom. At the same time, our position in Syria was a delicate one The military command was British, the civil administration was French. The French probably understood that we were more popular than they, and much tact was needed on oui pait to bring about the state of affairs which we all wished to see I felt sure that General de Gaulle wished to realise the ideal of Svrian independence. He was. however, handicapped in this bv his desire not to appear in French eyes to be ceding French rights. While watching Syria, he had to watch Vicny, too. Sheikh Hafiz said that he understood this, but that, unless the inhabi tants of Syria were taken into General de Gaulle’s confidence and treated as triends, the situation could hardly improve, and all Arabs were watching developments in Syria. ^ French, but the individuals were the same, and the people were not happy under them. 1 he truth was that the late French Administration had been most I am, &amp;c.

Following is extract from my speech at Mansion House on 29th May. Begins. 'Before turning to the broad world scene that to-day confronts us I should like to speak for a moment about the position in Iraq. Reports from that country are encouraging. The pretensions of Rashid Ali to speak for the Iraqi people have been proved false. Since his return to Iraq a few days ago the Regent has received innumerable messages of loyalty and support from all over the country. Many of Rashid Ali's followers have already fled. I hope therefore that very soon we shall have rid Iraq of this self-constituted dictator who has brought much unnecessary suffering on his fellow- countrymen. Then we shall be able to establish a basis for sincere and cordial co-operation with the Iraqi people in accordance with our Treaty and our mutual interests. That is all that we ask. We have no designs of any kind against the independence of Iraq. 'This country has a long tradition of friendship with the Arabs, a friendship that has been proved by deeds, not words alone. We have countless well-wishers amongst them, as they have many friends here. Some days ago I said in the House of Commons that His Majesty* s Government had great sympathy with Syrian aspirations for independence. I should like to repeat that now. But I would go further* The Arab world has made great strides since the settlement reached at the end of the last war, and many Arab thinkers desire for the Arab peoples a greater degree of unity than they now enjoy. In reaching out towards this unity they hope for our support. No such appeal from our friends should go unanswered. It seems to me both natural and right that the cultural and economic ties between the Arab countries, yes, and the political ties too, should be strengthened. His Majesty* s Government for their part will give their full support to any scheme that commands general approval.' Ends. c C .

At a later interview he offered the following observa tions based mainly on a message he had received from Ibn Saud. 2. He and the King were very grateful for expose of His Majesty's Government's views. Ibn Saud saw no point in holding a conference at this juncture; Iraqi Government appeared to be com posed of individuals each working for his own ends rather than in the_interests of Arab world: position of Egypt was difficult; Syria was an unknown quantify which could not be oroperly repre sented by anyone; ^ policy in Palestine and Trans-Iordan was the concern of His Majesty's Government; Imam would, he was convinced, always follow his, Ibn Saud’s lead. Matters would be discussed and opinions expressed which could not fail to embarrass His Majesty's Government, Ibn Saud thought that Nuri had only sug gested conference with a view to his own self aggrandisement. Ibn Saud could demonstrate to His Majesty's Government that he did not wish to play any dominating role or interfere in affairs of Arab states, but as a Moslem he was anxious to do all in his power to help so long as he was not asked to do anything which in his opinion was contrary to interests of Arabs or of His Majesty’s Government. As the future of Arab states lay in the hands of His Majesty s Government and was dependent on a British victory, v/hich could_be brought nearer by full Arab co-operation, it would be well for His Majesty's Government to counter enemy propaganda by attracting sympathy and goodwill of all Arabs. Ibn Saud did not wish to tabulate any views on future fate of Arabs which he felt was a matter for His Majesty’s Government to decide in due course. Amir Faisal did not think that time was ripe for [? Questioning], what was desirable was good understanding among Arab states and community of aims. 3. Asked in what way His Majesty's Government could 'attract Arabs' Amir replied that ibn Saud was referring to Palestine which alone stood in way of a perfect understanding between His Maiesty's Government and Arab world. Though Ibn Saud was convinced that His Majesty's Government genuinely intended to implement the Yhite Paper, many Arabs did not believe it and unconsciously immigration figures were lending colour in these peoples’ eyes to enemy insinuations that His Majesty's Government’s real aim was to form a Jewish state in Palestine. 4. In reply to Amir Faisal’s question as to attitude of Egyptian Government to Nuri's proposals, I said Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs had received a cold douche (Cairo telegram pou N 0 . 932) \ND\kN&gt; : ^952) z ^ Amir was pleased and relieved. ( !940 2 . 5. At the end of the interview Amir said that he had been expressing his personal views and the views of the King based on a telegraphed summary of my aide-memoire. When King had received Faisal's despatch covering full text he thought he would reply at length in writing.

He apologised for the frequent occasions on which the Saudi-Arabian Government have recently bothered His majesty's Government but explains it is because: 1. Their policy has always been to bring matters to the notice of His majesty's Government. 2. They wish to avoid taking any action which might prove prejudicial to the interests of His Majesty's Govern ment. 3. Ibn Saud realises that words may have consequences affecting the interests of Saudi Arabia and His Majesty's Government and Arabs in general (this presumably refers to Nuri Pash&amp;s conversations and proposals for meetings.) In conclusion Amir Faisal states the views of the Saudi- Arabian Government coincide with those of His Majesty's Government and he will continue to communicate to me all matters tportance,as this in his opinion, is in the interests not | only of our two Governments but of the Arabs generally.

Your telegram No, 131 to Jedda 0 I should have recorded in my earlier telegrams that the Prime Minister was definitely inclined to pooh-pooh the ideaof any direct Egyptian interest as an 'Arab State', In his talks with Nuri he limited the scope of Egyptian help to the moral field, lending technical experts for the development of Iraq such as irrigation, etc, I did not sound the Prime Minister regarding an idea of an Arab Conference but his attitude as above described [?had] some bearing on his probable reaction to any suggestion of an Arab Conference. 2. On the other hand we must always remember that Nuri is hand in glove with Ali Maher, with whom he had close contact during his visit here,‘ Ali Maher and his clique (Azzam, Saleh Harb, and company) are rabid pro- Arabists and undoubtedly hoped to see Egypt taking a prominent if not dominant rCle in any discussions and they still have ways and means (specially their close association with the Palace, which continues unabated) to make their presence felt.

Generally speaking it is important to avoid giving impression that views of His Majesty’s Government necessarily constitute obstacle to federation, whether this idea (which may mean anything from a combination of States or territories each retaining their individual identity to complete political amalgamation) is conceived as applying to a large or a small part of present Arab world. General line of British officials who may be tackled on subject should be that, while there are obviously many difficulties in the way, Hie Majesty*• Government are perfectly willing that anyone who is interested should go ahead and work out a practical scheme. If this is done His Majesty’s Government are only likely to intervene in order to secure essential British interests or fulfilment of their international obligations. Scheme must, however, have , eneral Arab support, i.e. support of all leading Arab groups. 2 . I realise that question at once arises as to what essential interests and international obligations His Majesty’s Government have in mind. Hie Majesty’s Government would be unlikely to conmit themselves on these points unless by some innlikely chance it seemed xxxxxxxx /that1940 ] that a practical scheme was being shaped by responsible representatives of Arab Government.

This note has now been prepared and printed, and I attach a copy for your information. 2. In drawing up this note, we have not consulted any other government departments or any of our representati abroad. It is being circulated to all those departments and posts abroad which are likely to be interested, and will no doubt provoke a great many useful ideas, which may even render desirable a revised edition later. 3 .

CONFIDENTIAL. ,1 * Section 3 \—/ (15727) [E 6357/6/31) Copy No. j | Memorandum respecting Arab Federation. THE independent States which are commonly called the “ Arab States ” are Egypt, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and the Yemen, the first and second of these torn being allies of the United Kingdom. To these must be added Syria, tne Lebanon and Transiordan. which are administered by their own Governments under the guidance of a mandatory Power (France in the first two cases and tne United Kingdom in the third), Palestine, which is directly governed by a mandatory Power (the United Kingdom), the British Colony and British Protectorate of Aden, the British-protected States of Koweit, Bahrein, bJatai, Kalba and the six Trucial Sheikhdoms, and Muscat, which is juridically entirely independent, but in practice subject to a considerable degree of British intluence. To make the picture absolutely complete, mention must be made ot the Kuna Muria Islands, which are British territory, and certain islands m the Ked feea of which the sovereignty is at present indeterminate. The inhabitants ot Tripolitana, which is part of the Italian Empire, and other territories of JNorth Africa are sometimes referred to as Arabs, but the fate of these countnes lies outside the scope of the present memorandum. So does the Sudan, which is under the condominium of Great Britain and Egypt, for, although Arabic is spoken there, it cannot be called an Arab country. 2 It is doubtful whether even the most enthusiastic pan-Arabs regard tne union of all the Arab countries in Asia, together with Egypt, in a single empire or federation as anything but a distant dream, although now that wireless and the motor car have solved many problems of distance and communication, and the discovery of oil has gone a long way towards solving the problem of finance, there is no intrinsic reason why the whole of the Arabian Peninsula as fai noith as the Anatolian and Iranian plateaux should not amalgamate into a single political unit. Egypt would always be likely to remain apart, although in the past it has on more than one occasion formed a part of great empires which embraced Syria, Mesopotamia and parts at any rate of the Arabian Peninsula. 3. Pan-Arabs usually begin with more modest schemes, and these schemes usually contemplate-— (a) The federation of Syria and Iraq (this was the form of federation most discussed in earlier years, a common idea being that there should be a dual monarchy under the King of Iraq); (b) The federation of Syria (and possibly the Lebanon), Palestine and Transjordan; or (c) The federation of Palestine, Transjordan and Iraq (this has been advocated by General Nuri-al-Said, the present Prime Minister of Iraq). 4. The idea of closer union of one kind or another among the Arab States on the lines of one of these three schemes, or even on more ambitious lines, has at first sight much to recommend it, and must seem especially natural to those older men who remember the days when they all belonged to one country, even though that country was under alien rule. For instance, Palestine and Trans jordan are geographically, economically and strategically somewhat unnatural entities, which only exist as the result of external support. The same is true of Syria and the Lebanon. The four territories are geographically a single area and some kind of union between them ought to increase the prosperity of each of the four. Some kind of union between Iraq and Syria (especially if Syria were enlarged by the addition of the Lebanon), Palestine and Transjordan would also be natural. On the other hand, any kind of union between Iraq, Transjordan : 705 ee—3] BTnd Palestine without Syria, would not be very natural. In slimt, theie is nothing inherently permanent about most of the present b / ,ullll f’ , h es ^ ‘ 'j^ countries. Apart f^m Egypt, andto a lesser extent ra ? ew of to-day, to^maintai^their independence. ^Directly or .ndnectly Jey ^t r^y sense of the rvord^ throughout the Arab countries including even Egypt, a common an-uage (despite local forms and dialects), for the great majority Lce“ t'heiZnon. a common religion (- h - b “^Vate'Se ~as sectional differences) and a common culture ow “ c ® tempting differences in development, education and sophistication). It would r»e remp to add”that'there 6 was a common racial origin, but there is probably nothmg of the kind On the other hand, Sunni Arabs regard themselves as foinnng one large community, and, whether this sentiment is scientificallyjustifiable not, thev are in consequence the main standard-bearers of pan-Arab idea . ' 7 As a result of these factors, of more extensive education and oi easier communications, there is unquestionably a growing ®“ 0 f n fraa Arab peoples. This sense of solidarity has been intensified m the case ot Liaq, Svria and Palestine by the struggles of each country to gam its independence. it has unquestionably been stimulated enormously in all Arab countries by tne troubles in Palestine. But many national movements have been similai y exploited and stimulated and are none the less real on that account. In the case ofhhe Arabs this sense of solidarity may ultimately overcome, at am ate temporarily, the personal jealousies of their rulers and politicians, as we as narrower local patriotisms, just as German nationalism eventually led to the German Empire P and the Third Reich, despite the opposition of the German pnnces-V^nTarS ideas are beset by formidable obstacles, which may be classified as the divergent interests of (a) The rulers of the various States, (b) France, (c) Turkey, and (d) Great Britain. 9 The jealousies among the rulers are intense. The strongest and most influential man among them is Ibn Sand, although his territory is one of the most backward and, until its oil and gold resources can be developed, certainly also the poorest. Hb is determined that, if there is to be any outstanding leadei among the Arabs, it shall be himself and no one else. He is particularly jealous of the Hashimite family, which formerly ruled in the Hejaz and is now represented in Iraq and Transjordan, and the prospect of either the young King Feisal II or the Emir Abdullah extending his rule over Syria or Palestine appears to Ibn Saud as a direct threat to his interests. The Royal families in Iraq and Transjordan no doubt repay his dislike with interest. Moreover, tne E,mir Abdullah and his relations in Iraq are rivals in various matters, especially that of the nebulous throne of Syria. Another aspirant to leadership in the Arab and indeed the Moslem world is King Farouk of Egypt, whose ambitions m the direction of the Caliphate have already made him suspect to Ibn Saud at least. The Imam Yahva of the Yemen is an old man to whom suspicion is second nature and the mere suggestion of dependence or subordination an outrage Even the little sheikhs of the Aden Protectorate and the Persian Gulf, although they may not like British control for its own sake, prefer it to absorption by stronger neighbours.^ . j oug . es ^ rll l e rs are reflected, though less strongly, in their Governments. The Ministers and officials composing the Administration of such a country as Iraq are like Ministers and officials elsewhere m that they try to make the best political and economic bargains they can for the romniumty which thev represent, without letting sentimental ideas about Arab brotherhood3 interfere over much with their aims or reflecting too closely upon the precise composition of that community For instance, the Sunni element, to which allusion has already been made, is actually outnumbered in Iraq by the Shiah Arabs and the Kurds, although it is politically predominant. Moreover, Arab brotherhood is soon forgotten whenever the Iraqi Government, for example, employ a Syrian or a Palestinian or an Egyptian for a post which an Iraqi thinks he himself could fill. Again, there is a genuine national sentiment at least in Egypt and, of recent years, in Iraq. In the other Arab countries national feeling in the wider sense can hardly exist. An Arab from Damascus, or the Hejaz, or the Hadramaut may and probably does have a fellow-feeling for those of the same local origin as himself, and a feeling of loyalty'—if he is a tribesman—for his tribal chief. But it is unlikely that his emotions are profoundly stirred by the Republic of Syria, or the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia or the Sultanate of Shi hr and Mukalla. 11. Finally, whatever the wishes of the Arabs may be (and notwithstanding the tact that a single large State or federation might, as already suggested, be better able to stand on its own feet than a number of small ones), the difficulties inherent in administering such a large, sparsely populated and backward country, in which Iraqis, for instance, will still look on Syrians as effete and Syrians still look on Iraqis as boors, make it most unlikely that even a single Arab State or union of Arab States could, at any rate for a long time to come, dispense with friendly help and support from outside. In fact, the best advice which sympathisers with pan-Arabism can give to its supporters is that each Arab State should first learn how to become strong and prosperous, so that it can bring strength and prosperity to the eventual federation, instead of weakness and poverty. 12. The French attitude towards Arab federation and a fortiori towards any closer form of union has been expressed emphatically and categorically on many occasions.(’) The French Government are definitely and implacably opposed to it as something which may weaken their position in Syria and even in the Lebanon. They maintain that it is in the interest of both Great Britain and France to stabilise as soon as possible the existing situation in the Arab world. Why the French Government attach so much importance to their position in the Middle East is not always easy to understand. The retention of Syria and the Lebanon under mandate cannot be of any particular advantage economically, except in so far as it provides employment for a number of French officials! Although use is often made of the argument that it is cheaper to maintain troops in the mandated territories than in France, the defence of territories so remote from other French territories must on the whole be an anxiety and a commitment rather than a source of strength. The reason is, no doubt, partly to be found in the historic cultural connexion of I ranee with the Levant and in memories of the French role of protector of the Christians in the East: in fact, a matter of pride and prestige, rather than of solid benefit. 13. Jealousy of Great Britain also plays its part in deciding the French attitude. Since the area in the Middle ' East where British influence is predominant is much larger than the area under French control, and since, more over, His Majesty's Government have always been regarded as more sympathetic than the French Government to Arab aspirations, it is assumed in France that French influence in a united Arab State or federation would be much less powerful than British influence. Any sympathy shown by His Majesty’s Government for pan-Arab aspirations is consequently not regarded as being wholly disinterested, and, in so far as it is considered to be a subtle attempt on the part of His Majesty’s Government to rob France of her share in the spoils of the last war, it causes considerable resentment. 14. In any case, the France of to-day is determined to maintain an effective hold upon Syria and the Lebanon, whatever their precise status may be, and. if there is one part of the world more than another where French Governments and officials have in the past been suspicious and resentful of British rivalrv and where even to-day His Majesty’s Government must pay more than ordinary regard to French susceptibilities, it is here. 15. There is not much that can be said about the position of Turkey The Turkish Government have repeatedly declared that they harbour no territorial (’) See annex for some examples. B 2 [705 ee—3]4 ambitions. But there are many people who refuse to believe this, ^ 11( f the absorption of the Hatay (the Sanjak of Alexandret a), an \iomio maintain that sooner or later Turkey will take steps to obtam control of ; PP and Mosul, if not of areas further south. Although it is unhkeiy that Tur ey will take these steps so long as her political interests tie her to Ueat BriUn a France, the existence of latent ambitions of this kind is probable enough. „ these latent ambitions do exist, an Arab federation might indeed appeal to Turkish eyes as a prospective obstacle to Turkish interests, althoug i difficult for the Turkish Government to say this openly. 16. There remains to be considered the position of Great Britain His Maiesty’s Government are sometimes exhorted to have a comprehensive po icy ^ for the Middle East( 2 ) and to formulate and pursue this policy on a lon g VT' This is admirable advice, but of a kind which it is seldom possible to follow effectively in practice. There may be an “ ideal Middle Last a grouping of States or political systems which would suit British interests better than any other But it would be difficult to find any two persons to agree on what form this ideal should take and even if the ideal were self-evident it would probably be most difficult, if not impossible, to bring it into being. For the purposes ot day- to-day diplomacy it is necessarv to be less ambitious, to take the Middle Last as it is and to endeavour to adopt the existing scheme of things to the more obvious needs of British Imperial policy. , Ar - , „ 17. The fundamental British interests m the Middle Last are, as it happens, well defined. They are communications and oil. Great Britain has two mam lines of communication from the Mediterranean to India, Australia and the I ar East The first which is primarily a sea route, runs through the Suez Lanai and the Red Sea’to the Indian Ocean; the second, which is primarily an air route, runs from the Mediterranean coast, through Palestine, Transjordan and to the Persian Gulf and thence down its western shore to the Indian Ocean. The principal sources of oil are Persia (Iran) and Iraq, with Bahrein and Saudi Arabia making rapid progress. The Persian oil is shipped by way of the Persian Gulf. The Iraqi oil is shipped from Tripoli and Haifa, on the Mediterranean coast. In years to come increases in the range of aircraft, the discovery of oil in l ar cre or larger quantities in the United Kingdom or Canada or other develop ments may alter the strategic basis of the British Empire and make it possible foi British policy to be less concerned with developments in the Middle East. But, until that day comes, Great Britain must in some form or other—not necessarily the precise form of to-day—conduct her relations with the Middle Eastern countries, through varying degrees of protection, influence, alliance and friend ship, so as to ensure that her essential interests shall continue. In particular she must maintain effective control, whether direct or indirect, of certain vital points like Haifa, the Suez Canal, Aden, the Persian Gulf and the Basra-Haifa air route, and she would not care to see any European Power less friendly than France established in Syria and the Lebanon. 18. Judging their needs by this standard, His Majesty’s Government do know fairly well what they want'from each of the Arab countries; and, in spite of German and Italian rivalry and an unpopular policy in Palestine, they have con trived until now to maintain their position as the predominant Power in the Middle East. It is impossible in pursuing any policy, “ consistent ’’ or otherwise, to please all the Middle Eastern countries and peoples equally. When one can only be pleased at the cost of displeasing another, all that can be done is to balance the major against the minor interest. 19. How then, in the light of all this, ought His Majesty’s Government to regard the question of closer Arab union ? 20. It is sometimes supposed by advocates of pan-Arab ideas that Great Britain must necessarily be opposed to these ideas for much the same reasons as France opposes them, and particularly because a single State embracing all the Arab countries would not be amenable to British influence in the same way as a number of small and weaker States. The invitations extended to the Arab States to be represented at the conferences on Palestine may have shaken this belief to ( a ) This term is used here to cover the Arab countries mentioned in paragraph 1, with the addition of Persia (Iran). It is usually held to embrace Turkey too, but Turkey lies outside the problem here under discussion. It might also be held to include Afghanistan, whose main importance is her position as a buffer between India and the Soviet Union.t Go some extent, but there is some truth in it, and it is unlikely that His ^flajesfty^s (;ro\eminent would of their own accord ever wish actively to proimjtfi. JiXtjd encourage pan-Arab ideas, even if the attitude of the French Government left them fiee to oo so, and even if their relations with the various Arab rulers were ^^pf such a kind that they could support a policy which seemed to favour one among ^Wiem without causing offence to the others. 21. At the same time, as has been said in earlier paragraphs, there is nothing inherently permanent about most of the existing boundaries of the various Arab countries, while pan-Arabism is a phenomenon in the politics of the Middle hast which has probably come to stay. This being so, any attempt to oppose the idea which it embodies, as opposed to any particular manifestation of that idea, or to treat it with open lack of sympathy, would be not only ineffective, but extremely unwise. His Majesty’s Government have therefore taken the line, when the question has been discussed in the past, that, while they would be unwilling to take any initiative and think that this initiative should, and must, come from the Arabs themselves, they would, if the point were to arise, endeavour to avoid displaying active opposition or open lack of sympathy, and would instead endeavour to guide the movement along lines which should ensure that the ensuing federation or union was friendly to Great Britain. These views have been expressed to the French Government on more than one occasion and they probably represent the least, and also the most, that His Majesty’s Government can decide or do for the moment. 22. This memorandum is not intended to be an exhaustive examination of the different forms which Arab union might take and somewhat vague terms have therefore purposely been used. But union can naturally take many forms, from alliances to complete amalgamations under a single administration. Iraq, Saudi Arabia and the Y emen are already parties to a Treaty of Arab Brotherhood and Alliance, which is not, in point of fact, an alliance in the true sense of the word, but a consultation pact. So far, this treaty represents almost the only step taken by the Arabs towards the realisation of pan-Arab ideas. So far as is known, no attempt has yet been made to give effect even to the limited obligations assumed under this treaty. It is not, therefore, a very long step, but it may prove the beginning of a long march. 23. In conclusion, some reference must be made to the interest which the Zionist leaders take in the question of Arab federation. It has often been suggested to His Majesty’s Government by these leaders and their sympathisers, as well as by other persons of no marked Zionist sympathies who, nevertheless, wish to find a solution of the Palestine problem, that an effort should be made to promote the union of Palestine and Transjordan with Iraq, or Syria, or both, because the Arabs of this larger State would have less objection to the immigration of Jews than the Arabs of Palestine alone; and the inducement held out to His Majesty’s Government to make this effort is that they would be laying up for themselves treasure in Heaven by earning the lasting friendship and gratitude of the Arabs. 24. It is conceivable that His Majesty's Government might be able to win the friendship and gratitude of the Arabs in this way. But it is unlikely that any assistance given by His Majesty’s Government and the French Government to the union of the Arab States would lead the Arabs generally to agree to any really substantial increase of Jewish immigration either into Palestine or into the Arab area as a whole. 25. It is also possible that continued German or other propaganda in favour of pan-Arabism may lead to pressure being put on His Majesty’s Government to declare themselves in the same sense. 26. It is hoped, however, that enough has been said in this memorandum to show that a spontaneous attempt by His Majesty’s Government to promote Arab federation, from whatever motives, would be a very risky experiment, from the point of their relations with the existing Arab countries, as well as their relations with France and possibly Turkey; and that a positive declaration on the subject should be avoided as long as possible. Changes in the Arab world are doubtless bound to come, possibly changes in the direction of closer union. The present Middle Eastern edifice 'is slightly ramshackle and His Majesty’s Government may sooner or later have to help in repairing it. But it will be better for them to wait until the play of natural forces has shown how their r* T? ; T6 assistance and support can most usefully be applied. To add to the present edifice a further storey, with nothing but theory for use as mortar, might merely bring it tumbling to the ground. Eastern Department, Foreign Office, September 28, 1939. Annex. The French Government have always been opposed to any idea of a federation of Arab States, and have on many occasions made their views known to His Majesty’s Government. In a memorandum referring to the Peel Commission report of July 1937 the French Ambassador drew attention to certain points in it which seemed to indicate that federation was a possible solution. He pointed out that such suggestions tended to encourage pan-Arab aspirations and had a disturbing effect on the situation in Syria. He urged that it would be to the interest both of Great Britain and France to stabilise as soon as possible the existing situation in the Arab world. The French Government themselves were doing their best to stabilise Syria. In October 1938, before the issue of the Woodhead report, the French Ambassador again spoke about allusions in the press to the idea that some form of Arab confederation might receive the blessing of His Majesty’s Government. This had greatly disconcerted the French Government, who were always desirous of being of help to His Majesty’s Government in those areas. In this instance they hoped most earnestly that nothing of this nature would materialise. Their own position vis-a-vis Syria was always difficult, and any idea of a confederation could not but add to their difficulties. Even were the inclusion of Syria not contemplated—and to this the French Government attached the utmost importance—nevertheless, such a confederation would act as a magnet and augment disquiet and agitation in Syria. Officials of the Quai d’Orsay spoke in the same sense at the same time. They explained that the French Government wish Syria and the other States to remain as individual entities within their existing frontiers; they would not favour any idea of a large conglomerate Arab State under a sort of joint Franco-British mandatory regime such as had been mooted in the British press.1. 16th hecerah No. • 7 6- /6930/66 Confidential .

IN the course of conversation some days ago Dr. Naji-al-Asil informed me that the Egyptian Minister, Abdul Rahman Bey Azzam, had been speaking to him about the possibility of an alliance between Iraq and Egypt. Ihe idea underlying this proposal was that, as Egypt and Iraq were now both allies of Great Britain, it was appropriate and desirable that they too should be allies. The Minister for Foreign Affairs explained the project to me in terms similar to those which Nuri-al-Said had used when he raised the matter with His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires last summer. You will remember that Mr. Bateman reported his talk with Nuri in his despatch No. 430 of the 21st August, and that it gave rise to some semi-official correspondence between your Department and Cairo. . 2. Dr. Naji went on to say that he had instructed the Iraqi ( narge d’Affaires at Cairo to sound the opinion of the Egyptian Government. I asked Dr. Naji what sort of an alliance he had in mind, whether he was thinking of the adherence of Egypt to the Iraqi-Saudi alliance, or of something quite separate between Iraq and Egypt alone. He replied that he had not yet attempted to think out in detail the scope of the proposed alliance, but it seemed to him that, having regard to the special relations of the two countries with Great Britain, Iraq and Egypt should be the only signatories. 3. A few days later I had an opportunity to discuss the matter with Abdul Rahman Azzam. He surprised me by saying that it had been Nuri and not he who had raised this question in the first instance and that in the present the initiative had been taken by Dr. Naji. Last summer he himself had felt no enthusiasm for the proposal because he had thought that Egypt, even after the conclusion of the treaty with Great Britain, would be too preoccupied with her internal affairs to embark on a policy of further foreign commitments. He had therefore tried to put Nuri off by suggesting that it was best to defer any further discussion of the matter until the treaty with Great Britain had been signed. He had then gone off to Iran and had thought no more about it. 4. Abdul Rahman went on to say that Dr. Naji had expounded the same ideas to him soon after his return to Bagdad. He still felt that nothing much was to be gained by the proposal. To him it seemed to be enough that Egypt and Iraq should each be the ally of Great Britain. So far as he could see the present proposal might bring to Iraq a little prestige in Arabia, Syria and Turkey, and even in Iran, to Great Britain perhaps a little more stability in her system of alliances in the Middle East, but to Egypt he thought it would give nothing. 5. He was surprised to hear from me that the Iraqi Charge d’Affaires at Cairo had been instructed to take the matter up with the Egyptian Government, for he had suggested to Dr. Naji that nothing should be done until he himself went on leave of absence to Egypt. In any case he felt pretty sure that no move would be made in Cairo until he arrived there. 6. I have known Abdul Rahman long enough and well enough to feel little doubt that his version of the story is the correct one. 7. Since my talk with Abdul Rahman, I have had another opportunity to speak to Dr. Naji. He told me that the Iraqi Charge d’Affaires at Cairo had spoken about the proposed alliance to Mustapha Nahas Pasha, who had seemed to welcome the idea and had told him to talk it over with the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Wassif Ghali Pasha too had given the proposal a favourable reception [931 a—3]2 and had spoken of the possibility of a treaty in the nature of the “Facte d ’ Entente balkanique. 8. Dr. Naji asked me what the views of His Majesty’s Government were likely to be. I said that I would report what he had said to you. 9.

ARCHIBALD CLARK KERR,THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY QF-mS3RTTXflN1id“MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT WITH reference to correspondence ending with despatch No. 32 of the 18th January last from Sir A. Clark Kerr, a copy of which was forwarded to me, I have the honour to report that the Egyptian Government has given me no intimation whatever of any pourparlers with the Iraqi Government regarding the possibility of an alliance between Iraq and Egypt. 2. To me it seems hardly consistent with article 5 of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty that the Egyptian Government should continue such discussions without keeping their ally informed. Indeed, it would appear that the Iraqi Government have interpreted the same treaty obligation to imply that His Majesty s Govern ment must at least be kept informed on the subject. 3. Before sounding the Prime Minister on the subject, I should, however, be glad to know what are the views of His Majesty’s Government regarding the desirability or otherwise of such an Egypto-Iraq treaty of alliance. Obviously in the minds of Iraqis and Egyptians who have discussed this question there is always present the idea of a larger entente between the Arabic-speaking nations of the Near East. The advantages and disadvantages of such a development have been discussed in Mr. Kelly’s despatch No. 1039 of the 4th September last and Mr. Rendel’s memorandum of the 22nd September last wuth Sir A. Clark Kerrs minute thereon, both enclosed in your despatch No. 925 of the 1st October, 1936. 4. Obviously there are both possible advantages and dangers in this development as regards our interests generally in the Arabic-speaking Near East. The interests of all these countries are more in harmony with ours than they are with those of Italy. A Turco-Arab-Egyptian bloc, working in close co-operation with Great Britain, would greatly diminish our difficulties in the Eastern Medi terranean. On the other hand, it is, as suggested by Mr. Rendel in the third paragraph of his memorandum referred to above, difficult to imagine that such a bloc would be prepared to agree to the permanent retention of our present military and air positions in the Near East. 5. ' Leaving these more general aspects of the question, it seems evident that, as regards the particular problem of Palestine, the conclusion of ententes between Egypt and Iraq or other Arab-speaking countries must be disadvantageous to us as long as we are committed to a form of Zionism which the Palestinian Arabs will not accept. Such ententes would tend to intensify external co-operation with the Palestinian Arabs against Zionism and ourselves. 6. On the other hand, as suggested by Sir A. Clark Kerr, its seems inevitable that Egypt and the neighbouring Arabic countries must sooner or later get together with a view to international co-operation. In principle it would seem undesirable to oppose tendencies which have in them such elements of inevitability. 1 suggest, therefore, that our attitude should he one of benevolent expectancy rather than of discouragement ; that in speaking to the Egyptian Prime Minister L should lay stress on the necessity of concluding no pacts contrary to the obliga tions and spirit of our treaty of alliance and of the League of Nations, but that otherwise I should, if asked for the opinion of His Majesty's Government, say that, while in principle viewing with satisfaction the prospect of friendly agreements between two of their allies, His Majesty’s Government must naturally reserve a definite expression of opinion until they are acquainted with the details of the project. 7.

Extent to which His Majesty’s Government can insist on prior consultation in regard to Egyptian foreign policy is not entirely clear since there is no specific provision in Anglo-Egyptian Treaty corresponding to paragraph 2 of Article 1 of Anglo*-Iraqi treaty. It is therefore difficult to maintain that Egyptian Government are under any legal obligation to keep His Majesty’s Government informed, although existence of an implicit obligation can be argued on ground that without free consultation between the two parties one of them might conclude some treaty which in the view of the other infringed provisions of Article 5. In any case the Egyptian Government might be reminded of action of His Majesty's Government in keeping them informed of the discussions with Italy leading to Anglo-Italian Mediterranean Agreement. 2. On substance of question I agree generally with your views and with action proposed in paragraph 6. Everything naturally depends on terms of any draft instrument which may emerge. In the case of the Iraqi-Saudi Treaty of 1936 the first draft vias from point of view of His majesty's Government unsatisfactory in certain particulars, but owing to the readiness of the Iraqi Government to consult Sir A. Clark Kerr it was possible to secure the necessary amendments. (See print of 1956 Eastern (General) January 15th Section 1 **• r2 . Section 1 and January Slst Section 2 and Eastern (Arabia) April 15th Section 1). In view particularly of the situation in Palestine it is desirable :.that His Majesty's Government should he able to supervise closely the wording of any mutual obligations assumed by Iraq and Egypt. 5. As regards the general form of an Iraq-Egyptian treaty, I agree with the view of the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs, reported in paragraph 2 of Sir A. Clark Kerr's despatch Ho. 52 cl the 18th January that a special bilateral instrument would £e preferable. It seems unlikely that Egypt would wish to accede to the Saudi-Iraoi treaty, which is essentially based on a common frontier between the parties. Balkan Pact which Egyptian Foreign Minister has apparently suggested (paragraph 7 of Sir A. Clark Kerr's despatch No. 32) seems innocuous as a precedent although of doubtful suitability for two countries physically so far apart as Iraq and Egypt. 4.

Mr. BATEMAN’S despatches No. 436-and•:430T o you of the 25th and the 21st August, respectively, are of consid^raWe interest from the point of view of Anglo-Egyptian relations. 2. It has generally seemed hitherto that Egyptian interest in the neigh bouring Arab States has been superficial, and there have been various reasons to support this view. The unique dependence of Egypt on the Nile, and the relative unimportance of trade relations with Near Eastern neighbours has tended to create geographical isolation. The governing classes in politics and commerce have been drawn mainly from Turkish, Coptic or fellaheen sources (Ziwer, Makram and Nahas are typical examples in the political sphere), and the modern Bedouin Arab is usually either half starved in the desert or an object of jealousy in the “ cultivation ” owing to his ancient fiscal privileges. The religious motive (which, in any case, acts in a contrary sense in the case of the Copts, and of the Syrians who play such a large role in the conduct of the press) has been apt to cut both ways, as was shown by the recently ended dispute with the W ahabee Kingdom and the resentment caused in Egypt by a dispute as to the disposal of funds contributed for the Mosque of Omar at Jerusalem. The religious bond with its product of common Islamic culture is there, an immense latent force, but it has been temporarily obscured. Chief among the factors making for isolation must, however, be counted the long modern association with England and the absorption of Egyptian interest in the treaty question and everything connected with the activities, real or imaginary, of the Residency. The whole emphasis has been laid on Egyptian nationalism in the strict sense, and racial and, still more, religious, motives have been entirely ignored. 3. There are definite signs of a changing outlook in this respect, and there is no doubt whatever that but for the treaty negotiations this change would have become very manifest in connexion with affairs in Palestine. In addition to the concentration of public interest on the treaty, the negotiations also gave Nahas Pasha a very strong inducement to meet us more than half-way in taking active steps to smother the attempted agitation, which, had it not been firmly handled, and had it not been for the successful issue of the treaty negotiations, might have developed into a situation resembling that at the end of last year. Nahas, however, took, every opportunity of passionately advocating the Arab cause in private conversation, using on one occasion the phrase “ we, too, are Arabs.” He is not; but, as the prevailing doctrine in Germany illustrates, the importance assumed by racial myths need not bear any relevance to the degree of truth contained in them, and there is, of course, much Arab blood in the fellaheen. It will be remembered also that the extremely moderate, sensible and highly westernised Dr. Hafez Afifi Pasha made a very determined effort to secure the reception of some Palestine Arab delegates at the Residency in June with a view to mediation being set on foot in Cairo. It is unfortunately far from certain that there will not be a revival of this agitation when the numbing effect of the signature of the treaty has worn off and the students reassemble next month. 4. Among secondary examples of the growing interest in neighbouring Arab States may be cited the spontaneous popular welcome given last year to the Amir Saud (followed by Ali Maher’s settlement of the religious dispute), but more considerable future significance may attach to the appointment as Minister in Iraq and Persia of Abdul Rahman Assam who, as described by Mr. Bateman, “ achieved a conspicuously higher standard of thought and eloquence than those of the Iraqis present” Although Abdel Rahman Assam was perhaps the most effective contributor to the campaign inaugurated in July 1935 by Takla’s Ahram [806 p—1]for treaty and Constitution, he is personally very well disposed to Great Britain, though at the same time a fanatical enthusiast for Arab unity. For this ideal he fought for years side by side with his fellow Arabs in a desperate campaign— prolonged till it was more than hopeless—against the Italians in Tripoli. Before his recent appointment he frequented and influenced an interesting group of younger Egyptian professional men or rentiers who met periodically in each^ other's houses, and though out and out Nationalists habitually included in their^-r gatherings several English officials and university teachers 'who had obtained their confidence on an unpolitical basis. Both at one of these private parties, which I attended as a guest, and on several other occasions, Abdel Rahman Assam developed to me at length his ideal of an Arab Commonwealth of Nations able to defend themselves against imperialist aggression and working in close alliance with the British Empire which would, in return, find that section of its communications doubly assured. He insisted that it was first essential for His Majesty's Government to settle with Egypt if only because that country was the only one in the Near East with an important Arabic press, instancing the wide circulation of his own paper, Ahram, in Syria and Palestine. I have dealt at some length with his views first as he is a man of real character and attractive personality with the restless independent nature of the true Arab. His mind works (unlike the Egyptians) on military lines—last year at the height of his press campaign it was always the idea of a military alliance which interested him primarily, not of the treaty as traditionally visualised by the Wafd—and further, because his views were well known to those by whom his appointment as Minister to Bagdad was made. Moreover, the views developed by Nuri Pasha, as reported by Mr. Bateman, tally so closely with those of Abdel Rahman that it would be interesting to know whether Nuri Pasha held them before Abdel Rahman’s arrival in Bagdad. 5. However vague and theoretical the new gospel of Arab solidarity may be when it comes to concrete action (and I am well aware of the volatile and unco-ordinated mentality of the “ bird-witted Arabian ”—Doughty’s expression, I think—a tendency observable in the history of his politics as of his religion),’ I nevertheless feel that it is a sufficiently definite and shaping state of mind to be a factor with which to reckon. Even though it may remain only a state of mind, it may make the difference between a wave of friendly or a wave of hostile emotion towards ourselves in all these parts. 6. It is a factor which might now be turned to our advantage with the help of the Anglo-Egyptian treaty (an indispensable preliminarv), and there is, after all, nothing intrinsically fantastic in the vision of a Near Eastern “ Little Entente ” headed by Egypt and working in close harmony with His Majesty’s Government. But it is a double-edged weapon which, in the event of its not being turned to our advantage, may contain elements of serious trouble. 7.

DURING the course of a recent conversation Nuri Pasha told me that he had been reflecting on the new situation created by the impending signature of a treaty of alliance between Great Britain and Egypt. He seemed to think that, as Egypt would soon be the ally of Great Britain, Iraq and Egypt could be considered, for defence and other purposes, as allies of each other. 2. He went on to say that, in view of recent developments in the Mediterranean and Abyssinia, it behoved the countries of the Near East to act together as far as possible in withstanding Italian aggression. In his mind it was clear that His Majesty’s Government had determined on a stronger line in the Mediterranean, and he believed that joint action by Iraq and Egypt, in the promotion of a forward Arab policy in the Near East, would be of no little assistance to Great Britain in this connexion. Egypt would now have a great opportunity to increase her influence in Yemen and the Hejaz, while eventually she might be destined to play an important part all along the north coast of Africa. Iraq could be a co-partner in this movement—in the Eastern Mediterranean and Arabia—and he himself was all in favour of getting busy without loss of time. 3. His idea was that, for a beginning, the relations between Egypt and Iraq should be strengthened in the following particulars:— (a) The improvement of communications by land, sea and air. (b) The adoption of a common military doctrine, aided by the use of the same text books, works of reference and words of command in the Iraqi and Egyptian armies. (c) Closer cultural intercourse. 4. As the new Egyptian Minister seems imbued with similar ideas, I should not be surprised if in the near future Nuri Pasha makes some definite suggestions in the above sense to the Egyptian Government. He said that he had, when in London in the spring, spoken in somewhat similar terms to Sir Lancelot Oliphant, who had told him that it would be well to wait until the signature of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of Alliance had become a fait accompli, 5.

The main points which appear to emerge are (a) it is necessary to distinguish between 'Pan-Arabism” and 'Pan-Islamism'. The Pan-Arab movement is essentially political and the purely religious aspect is of little general importance. (b) The Pan-Arab movement is continually hindered and side-tracked by Arab Nationalism in the individual post-war Arab States. For instance, the Syrian or the Palestinian Arab is necessarily more interested in conflict with his own Mandatory Power, with a view to national independence, than in striving for a 'United States of Arabia' or the like. 3330 1000 12.34(c) The present force of the Arab movement lies chiefly in the spread of Arabic literature and journalism, and is more on the intellectual plane than the practical. Colonel Mackereth has served since the war in Beirut, Tangier, Fez and Addis Ababa and has been in Damascus since 1933. His views are probably of value, and his theories seem to be borne out by events in Syria and Palestine and by the fact that disturbances in these countries do not in practice appear to have led to any general Pan-Arab activities on a comprehensive scale. He sees the matter, of cours* from the Syrian aspect, and may not perhaps give enough weight to the Pan-Arab diplomatic activities of the Iraqis (see Sir A. Clark Kerr’s despatch on P.Z.4684/36 below); but on the v/hole it seemias if local Arab Nationalism v/as likely for some time to come to take precedence of any efforts to secure a Pan Arab international ’bloc’.

May 27, 1936. CONFIDENTIAL. P. z Section 1. [E 3039/381/65] Copy No. (No. 46.) Sir, Damascus, May 15, 1936. I HAVE the honour to transmit to you herewith a short memorandum on pan-Arabism. I have made these notes largely with a view to clarifying my own mind on this very confused question. There is no doubt of the existence of an Arab movement, but there is considerable doubt regarding its potentialities. BEFORE attempting a brief examination of the Arab movement, a quotation from Meredith Townsend’s essays Asia and Euroye, written at the end of the last century, may not be out of place, for that writer possessed undoubted qualifications as a student of the East. He wrote :— None but those who have lived among Asiatics can understand how an oriental mind can brood over an idea. It is perhaps the most marked distinction between him and the Western man : the European thinks, the oriental only reflects, and if left to himself the idea turned over and over endlessly in his mind hardens into the consistency of steel.” It is difficult to think of a description that would better depict the attitude of the Arab towards the idea of pan-Arabism, which has been put before him by a small body of his own intellectuals. The idea bears no close investigation, yet it cannot be questioned but that it is deep-seated in the Arab mind and' only questioned when individual interests become involved. The Arab leaders themselves seem to find much of their inspiration in a per verted history of the past and ignore, or pretend to do, the reasons that led to the rapid decay of the Arab-Berber civilisation that seemed so glorious 1,000 years ago. These leaders preach that all the obstacles to the re-establishment of Caliphate Arabia can be surmounted by intellectual processes and passive resistance, and they encourage their followers in this fascinating exercise of self- deception. It may here be added, parenthetically, although it does not alter the general question so far as Great Britain and France are concerned, that pan-Arabism or Arab nationalism has never flourished otherwise than as a subversive movement finding its chief stimulus in a revolt against law and order, which the Arab has ever found irksome, especially when established by foreign rule. It has thrived only under what is thought to be oppression, and has always died in liberty. So to-day the pan-Arab movement is most lively in the mandated territories, where the mandatories are the “oppressors,” and yet are inhibited from employing “ the old Tartar method of stamping out ” the revolt against their rule. Since the war, the viper kept alive abroad to bite the Turk now finds in the bosom of its protectors a softer flesh for its fangs. Strictly speaking, the Arab movement concerns the group of States that were carved out of the Ottoman dominions conquered by the Allies. They fall naturally into four divisions, as follows : — 1 (1) Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Moslem and Christian Palestine, and Trans jordan. [706 dd—1] n I have, &amp;c. GILBERT MACKERETH. Enclosure. Memorandum respecting Pan-Arabism.2 r (2) Saudi Arabia and its dependencies of Hasa and Azir. (3) The Yemen. ^ v • a (4) The Arab States in Southern Arabia under British influence or protection. Religio-politically, the North African countries come within the scope of what has been described as a pan-Islamic movement, but which is in reali \ on y an extension of the pan-Arab movement. . . . , This grouping of Islamic countries is open to objection; it is, howevei con- venient and applicable to the present purpose. In order to avoid undue P^xity, only the Arab movement in the first group of countries will be considered, although it is a well-known fact that political activity in any of the countries in this group produces immediate reactions in the Berber-Arab North African countries. The leaders of the movement are themselves extremely vague as to the meanings they attach to the terms nation, nationalism confederation or pan- Arabism, but, in any case, their interpretations differ widely from our own. I hey will, on occasion, look upon Syria, Palestine and Transjordan as the Arab “ nation ” having a population of 5 million Arabs, or englobe the countries o Arabic-speaking peoples in Asia and think of a “ nation ’ of Id million Arabs. In more expansive moments they claim all Moslems as their brothers, and ta ^ o an Arab people of 300 million. In the Nation arabe, Shakib Arslan and Ihsan-al-Jabri (before the first-named became a remittance man of the Italian Treasury) used to take up the cudgels, not only on behalf of Arab countries, but of the whole of Asia and Africa, against Europe m general. . . , Amidst this confusion one finds the paradox of intense chauvinism m Aiab clans and Moslem sects of all matters concerning their personal rights, hatreds and beliefs. At first glance, the elements of disruption appear so potent that the ideology of pan-Arabism seems an absurdity; yet it cannot be dismissed so easi y. The movement in its modern guise began in 1905 with the creation by Syrian students in Paris of an “Arab League “ to resuscitate the Arab empire; an empire to be formed within what was then held to be its natural limits : from the va eys of the Euphrates and Tigris to the Gulf of Suez, and from the Sea of Oman to the Mediterranean.'’ , , i • Subsequently the pan-Arab idea was nursed almost exclusively m the colonies of Syrian emigres in North and South America, as well as m small groups ot Syrian and Lebanese students in France, Germany, Austria and Egypt. At that time the object of the conspirators was revolutionary and directed solely against the Turks; it was racial and in no way religious. It was equally so during the war when the services of Bedouin bands, under the leadership of the late King Hussain and his sons Feisal and Abdullah, were available in exchange foi Bn is gold and certain ill-defined promises. , , The war over, the movement, which had flourished and been fostered (not altogether disinterestedly) in European capitals, became anti-European. I he celerity with which the Svrians and Iraqis, after having for nearly four years been at one with the Turks in opposing the Allies, claimed as brothers the Bedouin whom they had hitherto despised and welcomed the British forces as liberators, almost immediately after to execrate them and the French as oppressors, exposes the inconstancy of the Arab, which is the outstanding characteristic ot his nature * a fact that in England, romanticism has sometimes tended to obscure. With this change of front the movement developed a unifying rehgrous aspect, which had hitherto been absent, and spread beyond the limits ot the P16 ''Notwdhstandhig P however, this newly acquired religious force the congress held in Cairo in 1924 for the purpose of appointing a Caliph of Islam did little but bring into relief the jealous cultivation of separate and independent nationalism, which had developed in each of the Arab States that had come m o as a result of the Allied victory over the Turks, let the Aiab leaaeis in these States, with an inconsequence so natural in them yet so disconcerting to e European observer, have never ceased to accuse England and France of Mach - vellian cunning in the post-war parcelling of Arabia into the very States that now insis ^P^ a j^^^£ C ^^^ ) j 1 ^tel^ctuals aim perhaps not so much at the attainment nf a “United States of Arabia” or federation as at a conglomeration of Arab States imder the moral*control of a central congress (a sort of Arabian League of3 ► 35^ Nations) seeking inspiration, guidance and discipline from the head of the most powerful State-member. Much hope of this died with the late King Feisal of Iraq in 1933, for King Ghazi has not in this respect taken the place his father held. Since then, eyes are turned rather in desperation and with little optimism, to King Abdel Aziz of Saudi Arabia, who has at last, after years of jealous hesitation, in signing a treaty with Iraq, taken the first tangible step in the “ Halaf Arabi(Arabian Alliance) that was dear to the former King of Iraq. The “ Halaf ' was to comprise Iraq, Transjordan and Saudi Arabia and later be extended to other Arabian States. The fundamental underlying idea of these projected alliances was mutual protection against European Powers and Turkey. Syrian and Palestinian Nationalists consider that the most important imme diate hindrance to further progress lies (a) in the divisions effected by the French in Syria and Lebanon and, as they see it, in the exaggerated regard the French are showing for the protection of “ minorities,” even to the extent of importing fresh f£ minority ” elements, in the Assyrians, from Iraq, and (b) in the rise of a Jewish population in Palestine strong enough to resist Arab domination. So the Nationalist executives in Syria and Palestine, like any Arab muleteer with his beasts of burden, seek to keep every political sore open on the back of a docile and ignorant population the better to goad it to self-impoverishing strikes and to desperate and painful civil disobedience, with the object of developing a sense of grievance and of wearying the mandatory Powers to the point of making them anxious to be rid of their mandatory burden. The programme sketched in 1932 at the Jerusalem meeting of Arab Nationalists of different countries under the chairmanship of Yassin-al-Hashimi (the leader of the Opposition party in Iraq and now Prime Minister there) avoided discussions on religious problems and followed the advice of the late Saad Zaghlul in Egypt to abstain from disputes over Islamic or quasi-Islamie rites and non- Islamic faiths. The avowed object of such unaccustomed silence was to “ deprive imperialistic policy of the arm of minorities that it finds so handy a means for keeping the peoples of the East in subjection.' The rest of the programme j consisted in an Arabian Zollverein, the unification of currency systems, the creation of an Arab bank and the abolition of passport formalities. Finally, as a symbolic gesture, it recommended the adoption of a uniform flag and postage stamp for Iraq, Syria and Transjordan. The congress which was to have been held in Bagdad under the presidency of the late King Feisal following this preparatory meeting to discuss and approve the programme there fixed did not assemble because (so w^rote “ Fata-al- Arab ” on the 8th October, 1932) of personal ambitions nurtured under British inspiration. This was a blow to the hopes of the pan-Arabists that proved all but fatal. Out of the flames, however, of the Syrian disturbances in January 1936 (set blazing by almost as small a spark as that which enflamed Palestine three months later), the pan-Arab phoenix rose again with an astonishing display of vigour. The Nationalist parties that had for three years remained divided by trivial personal rivalries reunited in opposition to the French, just as the Arab parties coalesced later, if somewhat awkwardly at first, against Zionism and the British upholding of it. How long this united front will endure is a matter for doubt; if the past is any guide, it will not long outlast the disturbances that gave it birth. Dissension is the very lifeblood of the sons of Ismail. Militating against the ideology of pan-Arabism is, as has already been men- j tioned, the creation and growth of separate Arab States (imbued with all the 1 chauvinism and individuality that the word “nation ” implies) in the old Ottoman provinces of Mesopotamia, Syria and the Arabian peninsula. Herein, perhaps, exists a force that will grow increasingly inimical to Arab cohesion and confederation. Slowly, yet surely, the national idea is developing. In each State has been formed a Government with a permanent or semi-permanent officialdom, recruited on European lines and jealous of its power and prospects. Autarky has more than made an appearance and national defence forces have been individually organised and infused with local esprit de corps. Legal and political systems, grafted upon different roots, have grown quite dissimilar. Each country has apart from the influence of the mandatory Powers tended to become increasingly conscious and jealous of the boundaries fixed by the “victorious allied Powers.” It is sufficient in this connexion to recall the frontier difficulties 1 [706 dd—1] b 2 \4 t # that have arisen between Iraq and its Arab and Islamic neighbours. Xenophobia has also reared its head in the labour market in Iraq where, as in Egypt some years ago when considerable hostility was shown by Egyptians to officials of Syrian or Lebanese origin, Syrians are still regarded bitterly and begrudged the savings they make and export to their own country. In Syria, Saudi Arabians or Iraqis are generally despised, secretly if not always openly, and scoffed at as “ ajanib ” (“ajanib” is one of the Arabic words for foreigner and has an opprobrious tang to it). Transjordan, too, has shown the same distaste for foreigners. Great fear of the Zionist movement has made the Palestine Arab slightly more tolerant of his brethren from adjoining countries. Possibly a cantonment system, the idea of which Mr. Archer Gust recently revived, could it be made workable, might render leaders of Arab political thought there more exclusively Palestinian in their outlook. They appear, even to-day, to be loath to consider amalgamating their lot, except as the dominant partner, with that of the more primitive Arab population of Transjordan. Saudi Arabia, being on a much lower plane of social evolution, has witnessed a slower growth of “ national' spirit and so less objection is at present raised to the enlistment of the services of “ ajanib.' A noteworthy instance of this is the employment of a Druse (the last of heretics to a Wahabi, one might suppose) as an important official. The position of Egypt in the pan-Arab movement is by no means clear. It has shown little sign of wishing to take any collective responsibility in an Arab or Islamic confederation. Indeed, it has been said that Egypt has yet to make up its mind whether it is an Arab, a Pharaohic or a would-be-western State. If the facts and tendencies of the Arab movement have been fairly indicated so far in this memorandum, it is evident that the whole matter is in a state of considerable confusion and charged with incompatibilities. The partition of the Arab or quasi-Arab provinces of the Ottoman Empire into separate States, and the internal organisation of some of these newly-formed States on differing European lines, have created a peculiar political situation, and have at the same time confronted Arabian politicians with three conflicting alternatives : pan-Arabism, pan-Islamism and nationalism. The effort to render these alternatives mutually sympathetic has led to obvious contradictions, which seem to have weakened each and have led to a dissipation of vital political force, for any one of them argued to its natural conclusion rules out the other two. The pan-Arabists urge the suppression of the individual State and seek to abolish as between Arabs all political and religious barriers. But these same pan-Arab rhetoricians are no less ardent in demanding the exclusion from State-paid employment Arabs from neighbouring countries, or in protesting against having an undue number of Christians, as in Syria and Palestine, or of Sunnis or Shiahs (according to the religious complexion of the speaker) in Iraq. Iraq, rich in its oil royalties, feels no urge to share its wealth with Syria or Transjordan, through which countries its oil passes to the markets of the world, while Syria cultivates the hope that its independence will enable it to extort from Iraq transit dues on the oil passing through its territory. Perhaps it is in these local jealousies (and they are only taken as samples and are by no means exhaustive) that to-day, as 900 years ago, lies the weakness of the Arab movement and of Islam as a permanent political force. The power of religious as distinct from political (and the distinction exists) Islam to weld the heterogeneous elements into a whole may also be doubted, notwithstanding the fact that a considerable weight of Arab opinion favours the possibility. The ability of the faith to infuse strength into resistance against English, French and Jewish “colonisation' is marked, but it represents only half of the present story of pan-Islamism. The other half concerns the possibility of reconciliation of the many Islamic schisms : Sunni, Shiah (the main ones), Wahabi, Metawileh, Ansariyeh, Druse, and many smaller sects; and, finally, the numerous Islamic confraternities. In addition, the element of Christian Arabs, particularly in the ranks of the intelligentsia, is by no means as negligible as their numbers would seem to imply. So great and intangible are the difficulties of establishing pan-Arabism on a religious basis that it may seriously be questioned whether the religious aspect is of any importance at all beyond its immediate value as a focal point against the European Powers immediately affected.The more advanced, and possibly the most energetic, protagonists of pan- Arabism have been ready to appeal for support to the “ free thinkers ” in England, France, Germany and Russia, and to go so far as to propose a union of agnostic and communistic forces against Christianity; anything, in fact, to get freedom from the Western yoke. In this way pan-Arabism has begun to be h divorced from pan-Islamism after but a brief marriage. (; Nowadays the vital force of the Arab movement lies chiefly in the spread of modern Arabic literature and of journalism. Thanks to the persistent and skilfully directed efforts of the Egyptian educational authorities to standardise a modern and simplified language to replace “ classical ” Arabic, which has become as dead as Latin, a growing literary output has been made intelligible in countries using different dialects. The standard of thought found in Arabic journalism is, to say no more, mediocre, and full, as Johnson would have said, of deliberate anf ractuosities of temper, but it is widely esteemed by the masses. It is a diverting sight to visit an Arab cafe and find a literate Arab reading to a large circle of semi-literates bits from Arabic newspapers, published in Damascus, Jerusalem or Cairo, reviling the Western Powers for their iniquitous treatment of orientals or proclaiming the power of the Italian air force to blow the British fleet out of the sea, and a thousand and one more abstruse mysteries that must have about the same influence on the hearers as the tales of Scheherazade. Discussions follow that usually take the most ludicrous turn; all with an air of gravity that might lead the onlooker to think it represented profound understanding. In this manner a fairy web is woven all over the Arabic-speaking world. It will be instructive to follow closely the effect of Arab journalism and literature in moulding and unifying Arab opinion and in weaning it from its present parochial interests. But, if a guess is permissible, it will be many generations before » anything palpable appears. Until then it would seem certain that local Arab I nationalism will be the rule. And the longer it is the rule the more important Jj will local factors become. With this, the dream of a “ United States of Arabia ” or an Islamic confederation brought about by culture, religion and peaceful persuasion in a greater common weal, will tend to become an abstraction suitable ' onlv for the entertainment of philosophers.

I HAVE read with interest the report on the pan-Islamie Arab movement enclosed in Sir Miles Lampson's despatch No. 223 of the 24th February last, which came to me under cover of your despatch No. 229 of the 15th April, and 1 venture to submit some observations on this subject derived from my own contact with it in this country. 2. In the first place, I think it is perhaps a little misleading to use the term pan-Islamic when discussing the modern movement which springs from Ara &gt; nationalism. The efforts which have been made in recent times to quicken the spirit of Islam have been fundamentally religious and universal in their aims, while the manifestations of Arab nationalism have been political and regional. There are, of course, points at which the two movements meet, but these are. I feel, too few to justify their being dealt with as connected phenomena. 3. The Islamic world has not yet recovered, and may, indeed, never recover, from the shock of the Turkish abolition of the Caliphate in 1924.^ If, in their hour of victory, the Turks had not thrown aside Islam and the Caliphate and declared for a purely secular and nationalist State, a new unity might have developed among Islamic peoples. As it was, Islam was rejected by the one State that might have assumed the role of leader, and the Mahometan world was deprived of the one central institution (apart from the Haj) which stood above the regional interests of its diverse peoples. Appreciation of the gravity of the situation led to a movement in some quarters to revive the Caliphate, but the proclamation of King Hussein as Caliph in 1924 and the Caliphate C ongress in Cairo in 1926 were both failures. The Congress of the Islamic World summoned bv King Abdul Aziz A1 Saud at Mecca in the summer of 1926 was equally barren of results. The General Islamic Congress founded in Jerusalem in December 1931 has also failed to establish its authority as a central directive body for Islam, and it now appears to be moribund. It should also be noted that, although its conception owed much to the idea of the Mufti of Jerusalem that the congress could be used to bring to the Palestinian Arabs the help of the Moslem world in the Wailing Wall dispute with the Jews, the congress itself was careful to resist all efforts to convert it from a pan-Moslem into a pan-Arab gathering. 4. The failure of this last effort to organise Islam was very largely due to the aloofness of all the Islamic Governments. The Turkish and Persian Govern ments regarded it as reactionary and obscurantist. The Arab Kingdom of Iraq and Saudi Arabia were suspicious of any organisation in which they could not enjoy a predominant influence. Egypt stood aside and Afghanistan was too distraught by internal disorders to have time to spare for the outside world. Only the Yemen accepted officially the invitation of the organisers. The line of cleavage was clear. National interests had usurped the allegiance once given to the faith. Henceforward, the peoples of Islam were to rally under their national flags rather than under the banner of the prophet. 5. The modern history of the movement to attain some form of political unity among the Arab peoples follows a different course. The spectacular manifestation of Arab national sentiment which was brought about by the Amir Feisal and T. E. Lawrence in the Hejaz (which, it must be remembered, was a revolt against the Caliph) did not evoke universal response in other Arab countries. In the heart of Arabia, in Nejd and in Hail, the princes and the people were quite unmoved. In Mesopotamia the revolt in the desert was scarcely 1731 f—1]■ HiHH known, and Egypt had not then made up her mind whether she was really Arab at all. In Syria and Palestine the Hashimite rebellion won more adherents, but these two countries were too strongly held by the Turks for the Arabs there to give effective support. The vicissitudes of King FeisaTs career need not be recapitulated here. So long as he lived, some of the ambitions, which his father claimed to have been recognised in the MacMahon correspondence, survived, but the Hashimite conception of Arab unity had in reality ceased to be practical politics when King Abdul Aziz conquered the Hejaz in 1925. With the death of King Feisal the last dream of a Hashimite hegemony over Arabia finally passed away. For a while there was nothing to take its place, but although King Feisal was dead, the men who had led his troops and who had been his Ministers still remained, and before long they began to evolve a new plan for Arab unity. It is this revised conception of the older ideal which is now being developed and which is the characteristic feature of the pan-Arab movement of to-day. 6. The heart of the movement is now in Iraq, where the political leaders have become masters of their country’s destiny and are free to turn to wider issues. Palestine and Syria are still shackled by mandates, and until these shackles are broken the attention of the Arab leaders in these countries will inevitably be focussed on their local struggle for independence. Saudi Arabia is free from foreign domination, but is too backward and too self-centred to be able to take the lead. Egypt, like Palestine, is at present preoccupied with the settle ment of her relations with Great Britain. It has therefore fallen to Iraq to inspire and direct the revival of the pan-Arab movement. 7. I have reported some of the chief indications of this revival in my despatch Xo. 101 of the 24th February last. Since then other events have continued to reanimate national sentiment. Another semi-official Iraqi delegation has been vociferously welcomed in Syria, Palestine and Egypt, a treaty of Arab Brotherhood and Alliance has been concluded between Iraq and Saudi Arabia to which it is open to all other independent Arab States to accede, and a significant rapprochement has taken place between Egypt and Saudi Arabia. The disorders in Palestine and the struggle of the Arabs for a positive limitation of Jewish immigration have at the same time evoked strong feelings in Iraq. 8. The immediate objective of the leaders appears to be the steady strengthening of a common national feeling among all Arab peoples. Their methods are incessant propaganda and the fullest possible personal intercourse between the leaders and publicists of the principal Arab countries, Iraq, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Palestine. Their ultimate aims are less easily defined. They are no longer dreaming of an Arab Empire under one ruler or ruling family. They think more in terms of some form of close federation which would leave a wide autonomy to each individual State and which might perhaps stretch some day from the Persian border to the Atlantic. 9. The essence of their ideals was, I think, revealed in the negotiation of the Iiaq—Saudi Arabia 1 reaty, in which a defensive alliance between all Arab States, a common Arab foreign policy, a common Arab culture and economy and the facilitating of intercourse between all Arab countries were at first the’main issues discussed. For a variety of reasons provisions concerning all these points could not in the end be embodied in the treaty, but I suggest that they may be accepted as the objectives which the leaders of the pan-Arab movement are striving ultimately to reach. 10. The attitude of these leaders towards Great Britain is not I believe unfnendly. Bitterness about the alleged failure of His Majesty’s Government to lulni the so-called MacMahon pledges to King Hussein is now a thing of the past, and the straightforward honesty of British policy in Iraq, our friendship with I bn baud, our stand for Abyssinia and the present hopefulness of the situation in Egypt are all facts which encourage confidence in the goodwill of His Majesty s Government. In Syria, I am told, the Arab nationalists constants eulogise the success of Great Britain’s work in Iraq. It is only the Jewish question m Palestine which tends at present to embarrass our relations with the pan-Arabs; and the best of the leaders in this country and, I believe, elsewhere (although I cannot speak for Palestine) have not yet lost confidence in the desire and m the ability of His Majesty’s Government to devise an equitable solution ot this problem. It Jus can be done, 1 see no immediate reason why the pan-Arabmovement should be in any way hostile to Great Britain, or why its aims should be inimical to British interests. On the other hand, if the situation in Palestine continues to deteriorate, there may be, I fear, uncomfortable consequences for British interests in the principal Arab countries. n. i am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s High 'Commissioners at Cairo and Jerusalem, to His Majesty’s Minister at jedda and to His Majesty’s consular officers at Beirut, Damascus and Aleppo.

It will be seen that the movement has branches in Palestine and in a few of the principal towns in £»ypt and that its main objects are to uphold the purity of Islam and to purge all Islamic countries of the presence and control of Europeans. 2. The leader of this movement has recently been active in publishing articles in the Egyptian press attacking British policy in Palestine. A secret report receivad from a special section of the Ministry of Interior states that the Society held a meeting in Cairo on fcay loth to discuss the situation in Palestine. The President, Hassan el Banna, called upon all Egyptians, J osleme and Copts alike to defend the Masjid Al Ages and to show their sympathy towards the Palestinian Arabs by contributions of money.

They are known to have a branch in Palestine, and it is believed that they have a branch in China as a letter frona China has been seen referring to the activities of the branch there. In ,gypt there are various branches; amongst the more important ones are Tanta, Port Said and Alexandria. The numbers in each c&amp;so are unknown, but the approximate total membership in Bgypt la believed to be about eight hundred. The objects of the society are somewhat similar to those of the 'Young Moslerfie* ana they aim at maintaining the purity of the religion of Islam and the carrying out of its tenets rigidly. They also have anti-foreign and particularly anti- imperialistic views. They wish to purge all Islamic coun?;ries of the presence and control of Europeans. The President of the movement is a Government official in ono of the primary schools, his name is Haasan el Banna, iie is a graduate of D&amp;r &amp;1 Ulum school. Formerly he wore a turban, but he now wears a tar bush. The society hold weekly meeting*, at which the members are requested to make propaganda by every means in their power in favour of the movement. Subscriptions are collected regularly.

[E 1886/381/65] Sir M. Lampson to Mr. Eden.—(Received April 8.) (No. 362.) Sir, Cairo, April 2, 1936. WITH reference to my despatch No. 223 of the 24th February last, I have the honour to transmit herewith a copy of a further report prepared in the Sudan Agency in Cairo on the “ Pan-Islamic Arab Movement.” 2. Most of this report summarises facts already familiar to you, but the final paragraphs may be of interest. 3. The reasons of the sudden French yielding to the Syrian claim for treaty negotiations are given in paragraph 9, i.e., the fear of troubles in Europe, the Syrian tenacity, and the sympathetic interest of the Mahometan world in the Syrian effort. 4. It may be argued that there is some similarity in the development of the Egyptian situation. England’s preoccupation elsewhere encouraged the Egyptian demand for treaty negotiations and Egyptian tenacity made it difficult to refuse the demand. 5. The suggestion in paragraph 10 that the French yielded to the Syrians in order to make negotiations with Egypt difficult for us is too far-fetched. 6. With reference to paragraphs 11 and 12, 1 have, more particularly in my despatch No. 3 of the 30th March to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad, a copy of which was forwarded in my despatch No. 348 of the same date, reported on recent manifestations of the movement for closer relations between Arabic speaking peoples, in the Near East. An effort is now being made to constitute a new moral front of these countries against European encroachment. It is therefore likely that the results of the treaty negotiations between Syria and France on the one hand and those between ourselves and Egypt on the other are likely to produce mutual reactions in the two countries. I have, &amp;c. MILES W. LAMPSON, High Commissioner. ; d o i 4 April 8, 1936. ~| O g Section 1. (Secret.) Enclosure. Memorandum, respecting the Pan-Islamic Arab Movement. II. (The first note was issued on February 14, 1936.) AFTER a complete strike by the city of Damascus, which lasted more than fifty days, and a similar strike in most of the leading Syrian towns, the French Government suddenly gave way to the Syrian demands by declaring its willing ness to receive in Paris a Syrian delegation representing the Syrian Nationalist party, and the new Syrian Government which had succeeded the unpopular Government of Tag-el-Din Hussein, in order to negotiate a Franco-Syrian treaty which would place the relations of the two countries on a permanent basis. The terms were to be not less magnanimous than the British-Iraq treaty. This declaration by the French Government was quickly followed by a general amnesty to those arrested during the troubles. The political leaders, who had been exiled only a few weeks before, were recalled; the Government officials as well as the teachers of the school of law, &amp;c., discharged for political reasons, were reinstated, and both the French High Commissioner and his staff who had been only a few days before expressing disdain and contempt for the national demands, suddenly changed their attitude to one of sympathy and readiness to help in the achievement of their aims. [681 h—1]2 2. The Nationalist delegation, which consisted of H ashem-e 1 - A t a si ( ea e ), and comprising Saadalla-el-Gabri, Jamil Mardan, Faris-el-Khoun, a s aunc Nationalist leaders, left Damascus on Saturday, the 21st March, and arn\e( Paris on the 26th. Mardan is a graduate of French high schools m Paris ana Faris-el-Khouri (Christian) is a graduate of the American University ot Beirut. 3. The chief aim of the delegation is to get the French Government to recognise the union of the five different republics, into which Syria was ivi e by the French authorities, into one State with Damascus as capital. ® State is to include the Nasairiya country of the north and the Druses o e)e Hauran, and the efforts of the French to get these two distinct races to ask for their districts to remain under the present system of administration nave failed. The Syrians further aspire to a free Constitutional Government am their own army, with provisions for a military agreement and nnancia co-operation; also to membership of the League of Nations. . , 4. The position of Mount Lebanon will now be a source ol anxiety to bom the new Syrian Government and to the French. 5. Lebanon, as may be remembered, was granted an autonomous Government in I860 guaranteed by the six Great European Powers. Care was .taken to include in it as few Mahometan districts as possible, with the result that it became an essentially Christian State (with about one-tenth of the population compose of Druses).^ ^ mnce t(X)k over the man date, they added to Lebanon the whole stretch of coast from Tripoli to Tyre, with a considerable part of the hmtei lam . This considerably increased the Mahometan population—so that nearly halt the population of “Greater Lebanon is now Mahometan and Druse. ^ 7. When the French Government’s recent decision as regards Syria became known, a movement was at once started in the towns of Greater Lebanon which had been detached from the pre-war Syria, and added to Greater Lebanon, clamouring for their return to their original States, or, altei natively, the union of all Lebanon with the new Syrian- Federation. The majority of the Maronites of Lebanon, now the privileged ruling class, will oppose this movement but all the Mahometans for racial, religious and political reasons will continue to agitate for reunion with Syria. Wdth them are now ranged most of the non-Maionite Christians and the'commercial classes of all creeds, who foresee a dark future, economically and financially, for this small State if not amalgamated in the future Syrian State. ... 1 8. The French Government in Lebanon is taking drastic action against those clamouring for union with Syria—proscribing the formation of such parties as illegal, and forbidding newspapers to discuss the subject. This will probably have the opposite effect. Further, the French Government has expressed its willingness to resuscitate the Lebanon Parliament abolished some years ago and substituted by a small sinecure Parliament. 9. ' News received by private letters from Syria tends to show that the French were forced to alter their front for the following reasons :— (1) The fear of troubles in Europe. The change of policy was declared onlv a few days before the incidents on the Rhine. (2) The unexpected and unusual tenacity of the Syrians in maintaining their strike and in arranging for its advertisement throughout the whole world. (3) The great interest taken in the matter by the whole of the Mahometan- Arab world, including the official protest by the Iraq Parliament and the campaign by the Arabic press in Egypt, Palestine and Iraq. 10 Some persons add to the above the desire of the French to render the negotiations in Cairo difficult for the British; whether this is true or not will appear from the result of the negotiations in Paris and the extent of the self- government granted by the French to Syria. 11. The interest taken in all Mahometan-Arab countries and the sympathy shown to the Syrian cause have been immense. Iraq, Palestine and Egypt and Hejaz have unanimously condemned the previous French line of policy, and finally expressed their great pleasure and relief at the solution. On the occasion of the anniversary of King Ghazi’s birthday on the 24th March great celebrations were held in Damascus, Beirut and other Syrian towns. Contributions for the help of Syrian sufferers are being collected in Iraq, Palestine and Egypt.3 Even Prince Omar Toussoun has contributed £E. 50 to the fund, although he and other leaders in Egypt have, since the Great War, shown little interest in the Arab movement. (They probably look upon it with great dissatisfaction as being the cause of the downfall of the Caliphate.) The Prince and partisans /.' of this policy now declare that the only policy against European colonisation is^ an Arab pact. 12. The reception in Egypt of the Iraq parliamentary and school delega tions, of the Syrian and Palestinian students and pressmen, the speeches and poems delivered on these occasions go far to prove this new spirit of common feeling amongst the Arab countries. 13. The reaction in Palestine would certainly be the demand for an autonomous Government on the same lines as Iraq and Syria.

I w«8 invited to attend a tea oarty which the 'Moslem Brethren Society' of No* 15 Sharia Naarie held this evening in honour of some 50 members of the 'Oamiyet-el-^akaeed-el Kheiria' of Syria who had arrived to this country on a visit. The following ia a summary of what I have heard and seen in the meeting : The meeting includes some 200 members of the ’'Moslem Brethren Society moet of whom are University and Aihar students They are devout young men who make their orayers punctually and who adhere to the tenets of their religion to the ooint of fanaticism. Some of them delivered speeches in which they urged those present to lament the bygone days of Arabs and to do their beat to chase out the Imperialists. (Cheers of 'Down with Imperialism '). In the course of these speeches reference was made to certain Koran verses and Proohet sayings dealing with martyrdom and self-sacrifice for the sake of God and Country. Then came the turn of some of the members of the Syrian Society who delivered inflammatory speeches all of which dealt with the necessity of making endeavours to turn out Imperialists, Kngliah and French alike. The speakers wondered why Arabs should not be proud of their race, the same as Germans, Italians and Knglish who out themselves at the top of the other nations of the world. One of the Syrian speakers delivered a violent attack against the Italians and their atrocities. I consider that the ’’Moslem Brethren Society' will in the course of time be in a position to produce a reckless and heedless generation who will not abstain from selling their lives cheep end whose best wish would be to die as martyrs for /thethe sake of God and their country. It is a custom of the members of this Society not to auplaud sneakers but to shout In a chorus : 'God is great; Praise be to God*. The President of the Syrian Society delivered a sneeoh in which he told his hearers that the colleges belonging to his Society included 6000 students who, he said, must be considered as having become members of the Moslem Brethren Society'. He further promised that soon as they arrived back to their countries, he and the members of his Society would do their best to put into execution the principles of the brethren’* as well as they would unify their word in combating Imperialism and restoring the glory of Ajrabs.

I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith a copy of a report prepared in the Sudan Agency in Cairo on the “ Pan-Islamic Arab Movement.” 2. You will, of course, be familiar with the progress of this alienation of the Moslem populations of Syria and Palestine from France and England owing to the operation of their respective policies in favour of the Christians in Syria and the Jews in Palestine. The influence of Egypt on Palestine and Syria is considerable owing to its cultural prestige in the Near East and the diffusion of its newspapers. The agitation in Egypt has recently been reflected in both Palestine and Syria, and no doubt any increased tension in Egypt will similarly react on those two countries. 3. Press reports of agitation in French North African possessions seem to* show that the unrest described above is not without its counterpart in the western half of the Islamic territories on the Mediterranean. 4. His Majesty’s Government will no doubt have in mind the importance of conciliating Egypt and detaching her as far as possible from the anti-European fermentation in neighbouring countries. I have, &amp;c. MILES W. LAMPSON, Hiah Commissioner. Enclosure. Report on the Pan-Islamic Arab Movement. (Secret.) THE recent events in Damascus, Aleppo, Hama and Homs, the leading Syrian towns, ostensibly against French misrule, but really part and parcel of general Arab-Islamic unrest, are worthy of the attention of those interested in the political future of the Near East. To appreciate fully the importance of this unrest one has to go some years back in the study of events. Under the Turkish caliphate the Arabs of Mesopotamia, Syria and Palestine always felt that they formed a part of the ruling Turkish authority. They shared to a certain extent in the civil and military administration, but, more important than that, they were given a free hand by the Turks in the ill-treatment and robbery of the non-Mahometan elements of the population. With the advance of education and travel, however, the Mahometan Arabs began to feel that, in spite of their supremacy over the Christians and other elements, they had been deprived by the Turks of many of their national rights and privileges, and a spirit of dissatisfaction began to spread amongst the most enlightened element. Expression of these feelings were drastically suppressed by the severity of the Hamidian regime. During the short rule of the Committee of Union and Progress, this faction raised its voice even louder, and it was clear that it would be a force to be reckoned with in the future. But the advent of the Balkan, Tripolitan, and finally the Great War, crippled any growth of the movement. At the outbreak of the Great War the Arabs were anxious and ready to shake off the Turkish yoke and assume some sort of self-government. Hence the universal response to the call of King Hussein against the Turks. Events, however, after the war went far to disillusion them. (656 k—1]*2 It must be remembered that the feelings of the Arab Mahometans in general were exceedingly pro-British, and anti-British propaganda carried out in Egypt had little effect on them. They were witnessing with their own eyes the prosperity, the advancements and the liberty enjoyed in Egypt through British rule and longed to en joy a similar position themselves. The expulsion of King Feisal from Damascus, the end of their dreams of an Arab State, the Balfour promise, Zionist policy and French rule in Syria have gone far to alienate their feelings. The Arab Mahometans, who enjoyed immense material privileges and moral and social ascendancy under the Turks and who were looking forward to improving their social and political status and their future prospects, suddenly found themselves handed over, in Syria to French misrule, and in Palestine to the prospects of a Jewish State. In Syria they found all progress in their social and political life arrested and their country impoverished by the greedy economic policy of the French, and in Palestine they discovered the Jews, upon whom they have ever looked with scorn and contempt as inferior creatures, suddenly raised by the British to a degree of equality, with a threat of future suzerainty and supremacy in the country. Their general disillusionment and their conviction that Great Britain and France have misled and cheated them has altered their attitude altogether, and has totally wrecked their past confidence in Great Britain’s honesty and loyalty. They are now firmly convinced that the creation of the essentially Christian State of Great Lebanon in Syria and the Zionist State in Palestine are political strokes of France and Great Britain intended to create two non-Mahometan Arab buffer States in order to separate the Syrians and Mesopotamians from the Egyptian and Sudanese and other African Mahometans. The Syrians and Mesopotamians now believe that the political anti-British movement in Egypt, upon which they looked in the past with indifference, is genuine and worthy of their sympathy. The feeling throughout the whole of the Mahometan world may be safely described as one of restlessness, and in Syria, Palestine and Egypt as one of serious political fermentation. Hitherto the “ Pasha and old Arab notable classes ’’ have been scattered, disunited and self-interested; they have lacked experience and political individuality and have no common ties or interests. Circumstances have now greatly changed. Better communications and the advent of the motor have brought all the Arab States and peoples into close touch with each other. The morning papers of Cairo are read in Syria and Palestine in the course of the same day and in Mesopotamia a day or two later. The Arab youth, collected from all parts of Egypt, Syria. Mesopotamia, Hejaz and Yemen, now live and study together in large numbers in schools and universities. In the American University of Beirut, the pivot of Near Eastern education, nearly a thousand Mahometan Arab young men, from all the above countries, associate and enjoy perfect freedom of self-expression. They dwell on past grievances of their race and are inspired with future ambitions; when they return to their homes in the vacations they relate to the older generations the precarious political status of Islam and of the Arabs, denouncing the infamy and treacherous policy of Great Britain and France. This undercurrent of political unrest and dissatisfaction, based on the conviction that instead of advancing the Mahometan Arab has been thrown some generations backward, is now the problem to be tackled by statesmen in the Near East. The movements are now led by educated men who understand the world, but they lack a leader to co-ordinate the activities in different localities. At one time King Feisal of Mesopotamia was looked upon as the likely future man. But his career was cut short, and the movement will continue to be irregular so long as France keeps her large army in Syria and deals with the movement in the high handed manner she adopts at present, and so long as Great Britain can quell the movement in Palestine. But the students’ factor which has now come on to the stage, and which will develop and increase, is naturally going to keep this restive spirit awake and active. French corruption and misrule in Syria, unfortunately, is adding fuel and accelerating events. The present rising is due to a feeling of despair owing to the stifling of all national ambition for an autonomous Government in Damascus, and owing to the extremely bad economic and financial position to which the country has been allowed to fall. The movement is now widespread and more serious than the French authorities will admit. Recent arrivals from Syria state3 that, had the G.O.C. listened to the High Commissioner’s orders, he would have caused a massacre in Damascus similar to that of General SarraiJ’s a few years ago. The G.O.C., however, refused to allow the French troops to fire indiscriminately on the unarmed crowds. In Hama, however, where, it is said, eleven French soldiers were killed, French troops opened fire on the crowds and ‘there were over 200 casualties. The movement in Damascus is still holding its own. On the 11th February the business town had been closed for twenty-five days and a complete and successful boycott of the French tramway and lighting companies has been carried out. The strike threatens to continue and merchants are moving all their goods from the markets to their dwelling-houses. The expression of sympathy in Palestine with the above has been unanimous and all over Syria and Palestine the mosques have been used as the meeting-places and stormy speeches are heard from every pulpit. 1 he problem of the future is : “ What will be the attitude of these people in the event of another world crisis in which Great Britain and France are involved? ’ Surely they will do their best to seize such a valuable opportunity to rise, and with an independent and armed Mesopotamia and Hejaz the movement may be troublesome, especially to the French. The attitude of the Druses is certainly in favour of such a rising, but their past experience with the French has taught them not to make another attempt alone. The Christians in Syria are now suffering in the same way as the Mahometans from the economic crisis and look forward to the financial future with horror, and they are compelled to throw in their lot with the Mahometans, although the real feelings of the latter—when their mob is out of hand—may be illustrated by the fact that during the troubles of the last week a Christian funeral was stoned by the Mahometan ruffians. The Mahometans have apologised for it, but the real spirit is evident. In Palestine the Christian union with the Mahometans is now a genuine one. based on the fear of future Jewish financial supremacy and their own economic ruin.

Said Sabet, one of the Iraq deputies, spoke on Arab unity and said that Iraq would not consider itself independent until Palestine and Syria had also obtained independence. Danger surrounded Palestine and other Arab countries and the Iraqis pledged themselves to assist the Palestinians in their struggle. The Palestinians should persevere, unite and be ready to offer sacrifices on the altar of independence and Arab unity. As usual Ha 3 Amin was careful to ensure that only his supporters were in evidence at these receptions.

Clark Kerr to Mr. Eden.—(Received March 3.) (No. 101.) Sir, Bagdad, February 24, 1936. I HAVE the honour to report that there has recently been a noticeable revival in this country of public enthusiasm for pan-Arab ideals. This has been due in part to events in other Arab countries and in part to official stimulus. 2. The political disturbances of the last few months in Syria, Palestine and Egypt have naturally been given prominence in the press, and have been used as the text for innumerable newspaper articles which have dwelt upon the common interests of the Arab peoples and the necessity for co-operation between them. 3. Public interest in the affairs of the Arab world has also been kindled by visits paid to this country by several men of mark from neighbouring Arab countries. Amil-al-Ghaury from Palestine in December last, Ibrahim Abdul Qadir-al-Mazini and Assad-al-Dagha from Cairo during the present month are examples. All of these have been generously entertained by Arab and Islamic clubs and associations, and have addressed representative audiences on pan-Arab ideals. Dr. Sanhuri, the new Egyptian principal of the Bagdad Law School, and the other Egyptian professors and teachers who have lately been recruited by the Ministry of Education, have also been given a warm welcome as symbols of the growth of a closer understanding between the sister peoples of Egypt and Iraq. 4. The arrival of parties of young men from the Yemen for education in Iraq, the presence of Sheikh Yusuf Yasin from Saudi Arabia, the rumours of the conclusion of a pact open to all Arab States, to which his negotiations with the Iraqi Government have given rise, and the request of the Sultan of Muscat for an Iraqi expert to be sent to improve date cultivation in his State, are other factors which have been exploited by the enthusiasts to quicken popular interest and hope in Arab nationalism. 5. Another significant event is the conducted tour of Syria, Palestine and Egypt arranged this month for a party of over thirty students from the Bagdad Law School and Teachers’ Training College. 6. At the same time it is noticeable that there is now little or no talk of organising a pan-Arab conference, the favourite scheme of the late King Feisal, and that nothing has been heard for a long time of the union of Syria and Iraq under one crown. 7. The present promoters of the movement seem to understand that before ^ any sort of real political union can be established between the different nations of I the Arab people, a common sympathy and a community of ideals and aspirations j must first be developed. They are, consequently, at present chiefly concerned to j profit from every opportunity to popularise the principles of Arab fellowship, to ) inculcate pride in the common heritage of the Arab race and to arouse a determination to strive together for national liberty and prosperity in the future, j 8. The fact that Iraq herself has made such remarkable progress during ? the last decade and is free from irksome foreign political control undoubtedly gives the Iraqis a sense of pride in their achievement and places them in a position from which they feel able to help and encourage their neighbours in their struggles to move along the road over which Iraq has already travelled. 9.

Following the publication in ”A1 Jamia al Arabia' of an article on the subject of the Italian Abyssinian conflict, propagating the cause of Italy and praising its improved attitude towards the Arabs and criticising Abyssinia, the opposition press opened a campaign against the editor of 'Al Jamia al Arabia' and alluded to the liaison of his party with Italy. There have been further publications in favour of Italy reported to be from Shakib Arslan. Some efforts have also been made to recruit workers or Army followers for Italy, partly owing to 'Opposition' endeavours and # partly owing to the natural disinclination of the Arabs from Italy on account of its policy in Tripolitania, etc. this is not meeting with any measure of success. Generally speaking it appears that Emir Shakib Arslan and his co-workers in Europe, who had seme acquaintance with Mussolini before he assumed power, had been granted about a year ago an interview with the Duce who informed them that he favours a policy of friendship towards the Arabs and Moslems and asked them to cease propaganda against Italy. Emir Shakib Arslan and his companions seem to have agreed to do so on condition that Italy changed her treatment in Tripolitania, and an agreement to help the Arabs in the League of Nations; and they must have received a sum of money for propaganda purposes. The movements of Ihsan Jabiri from and to Palestine and the meetings held in Jerusalem after the return from Hedjaz last year of the so-called Peace Delegation must have/have centred on this matter. It is reliably reported that Ihsan bey’s medical advisers now s wish him to abstain from active politics for some years. (Please see periodical Appreciation dated(COPY) (291/6/35) CONFIDENTIAL .

When here they Rome, 27th March, 1935Ho•£36/74/£« (E 144l/144l/2i&gt;) and Peraonal British Legation JedcLa, lith i’ebruary, 19^ i&gt;* (My dear Mac) , I have just been reading with great interest the quarterly report for October to December enclosed in your despatch of 7th January. It creates doubt in my mind as to my own vie*'8 regarding the present state of pan-Arabist and its possible importance. I am specially impressed by v/hat you say in paragraph 4 about Nuri Pasha’s advice to the Syrian nationalists. It is quite evident from the Jerusalem reports that the Arab leaders there are as hopelessly divided among themselves as ever. You give a similar description of the position in Lyria. On the other hand I was a good deal struck, last year by evidences of efforts on the part of , eople like Shakib Arslan and Xhsan Jabri to stimulate interest in pan-Arabism as distinct from local movements, which have been so unsuccessful and have led to so much discussion. Is it not at least possible that the idea of such a large movement might attract ardent spirits all the more because of their despair of achieving anything by local efforts? The importance of this question for me lies in the fact that pan-Arabism takes in the minds of many of its exponents one of two principal forma according as it turns on the conception of one great Arabia under one strong domination or the conception of some kind of federation of Arab states. I think tnat the more practical men dismiss the first conception as unrealisable at present though some of the idealists see in it still the ultimate objective. There may even/ Lt.Col. C.maokereth, m.O. i/ ainascus.I even now be influences at work to induce Ibn Saud to pursue it, as be ins the man who might play the dominating role. I am not sure that the attitude of Saudi Arabia towards the second conception is as cold as it was in King Feisal^ lifetime and there are certainly people who would be glad to see this country the principal state in a constellation of Arab states, composed of a small namber of major states like itself, Iraq and the Xemen, and a larger number of satellites, (doomed perhaps to ultimate absorption by their big neighbours) like Kuwait, the frucial hheykhdoms, and perhaps i*oiscat and Oman, which might, however, be regarded alternatively as being qualified lor inclusion among the larger states or as being too remote to be taken into account at present. Certain facts come into my mind. huri Pasha seemed to advocate an Arab League in 19£l and huri is a tenacious roan. You reported some time ago a public statement by de ilartel that Ibn Saud had promised in no circumstances to interfere in the Syrian question. Fuad Hamza spoke highly to me of Huri last September in private conversation and spoke of the possibility of a meeting between Nuri aid Ibn Saud. Italy has been showing great interest in Arabs and pan-Arabs. It is true that the Italians tried to ride too many horses at the same time but the Treaty of Taif removed the principal bone of contention between them and Ibn Saud. Huri advises your Syrian nationalists to make terms with the French. These are only a few of the pieces in my jig saw puzzle. I cannot put it together, but is it not conceivable that active spirits may be willing to sacrifice Syria for the present for fear of embroilment with the French, to keep an open mind about Palestine, where it would be difficult to get Ibn Saud to take a hand and to concentrate, with some encouragement from Italy, on an effort to create a bloc of inner/ **■inner Arab states with Iraq, Saudi Arabia and the Yemen strung along its axis? It might be all moonshine but the idea would attract me if I were an Arab nationalist sick of local wranglings. You see those things from a great Arab centre; I # though well informed at second hand, see them from a position of isolation in a place, vhere most people are only concerned to know what they can make, directly or indirectly, out of pilgrims, I should therefore very much like to know how the facts, fancies and questions in this letter strike you.

A preliminary meeting for the organisation of the new Party which will be sympathetic to the pro-Mufti faction, was held in Jerusalem on l6th instant. It was attended by sixteen persons. It was agreed to call the new party the Arab Party; to draw up a pact to be signed by the members, to approve the statutes (with certain modifications), etc. The organising Committee will hold a further meeting on the 23rd instant to discuss, finance, the venue of the proposed Congress, internal regulations, and the final approval of the statutes of the party. It was decided that the Congress should be held on or about the 26th March. The draft statutes define the objects of the party as (1) the realisation of Arab Unity; (2) the realisation of independence in Palestine within an Arab federation; (3) to reject the National Home policy and to work for its abrogation; (4) to spread propaganda in favour of the Palestine Arab cause in particular and the whole Arab cause in general; (5) to improve social, economic and political conditions in Palestine. the people, particularly merchants and townsmen, seem uninterested./ The intention to organise this party, which had been declared several months before, did not occasion any feeling2 cln) uninterested. The ^pro” and 'anti^-Mufti factions have been vying with each other in supplying relief, or expressing sympathy with the Arab Zubeidat and the victims of the floods in Nablus, v/ith the object of drawing public opinion to their sides. The Mufti has visited Arab Zubeidat, Arab Ghawarneh, and members of his party in Haifa, Nazareth, Nablus and Tiberias. The tension between these two factions in Nablus is great. The Mufti of the town was insulted and one person was set upon and beaten by political opponents for cheering Haj Amin Husseini. Pan-Arab Affairs . 3. Ihsan Bey el Jabiri, formerly Syrian, arrived in Palestine ostensibly for reasons of health, but reports received show his intention to meet Syrian and Palestinian leaders and communicate to them the result of negotiations with Italian diplomats. The visit of the ex-Khedive, Abbas Hilmi, has attracted Arab and Jewish attention and speculation. The visits of the Mufti and the alleged friendly attitude of Government are the subject of public comment. It is said that interest as to his enthronement is still alive, particularly since the death of ex-King Ali. It is rumoured that he has promised the Mufti to invest money in the purchase of lands in Palestine so as to save them from Jewish invasion and that he intends to promote other schemes in Trans-Jordan. *- * , 'Jtw 1b i d*? v Extract from Summary No.l/35 from Criminal Investigation Department, Jerusalem, Dated 10th January 1935.

When Amir Shakib Arslan and others visited Palestine last summer it 'was agreed to hold a further meeting in January and preparations for this meeting are now in progress. The meeting will discuss the arrangements for the Congress and other matters and will be attended by delegates from Palestine (of the pro-Mufti and Independent Parties) and will be held in Egypt and the visit of Amir Adel Arslan to Palestine and Iraq is reliably reported to be in connection with thejproposed Congress. It is hoped that Abdel Aziz Thaalibi will attend on behalf of Tunis, Abdel Rahman Azzam and Mohamed Ali Pasha on behalf of Egypt, and that Yemenite, Hejazian and other Arabs resident in Egypt will also attend. The Palestinian leaders may also confer with Egyptian leaders with a view to obtaining their cooperation on the following matters:- (a) To gain the support of the Egyptian press for the Majlis Party and its leader and to induce editors to publish articles against the Opposition Party as being pro-Government. (b) To meet the Syrian leaders in Egypt, particularly Abdul Rahm§ 43 »J 3 hahbander and Kheir el Din Zerakli and to persuade them to spread propaganda for a general congress of Arabs from Mandated territories to discuss present conditions in their countries. (c) Through the medium of Nahas Pasha to get into touch with influential Egyptians and to ask them to take up the question of the sale of land to Jews. The delegation proposes to ask these men to publish pamphlets dealing with the disastrous effect of such sales and to persuade the more prominent Sheikhs in Egypt to issue n fatwas n prohibiting further sale of land in Palestine.

(ft- V 1. The pan-Arab movement is coming increasingly into prominence, and is likely, in future, to have considerable importance. Since the death of King Peisal this movement and the all-Arab Congress scheme fell into oblivion. Discussions, however, held in Hejaz and Yemen by members of the 'Peace Delegation' and the termination of hostilities between the Ibn Sioud and Imam Yehia resuscitated the movement and encouraged its sponsors to renew their activities. Consequently a number of leaders repaired to Jerusalem to lay down a programme of concerted action, while Hashem el Atassi acted in Egypt and Assad Dagher proceeded by air to Iraq to apprise the leaders of the new position. Amongst the leaders who gathered in Palestine were the Emir Shakib Arslan, Abdel Aziz Thaalibi, Ihsan Bey el Jabiri, Izz el Din Halabi, Hashem el Atassi, Assad Dagher, Jamil Bey Mardam, Hiad Bey el Sulh, Haj Adib Kheir and Shukri el Quatli, while the Syrians already in Palestine (namely Ahmed Hilni Pasha, Nabih Bey el Azmeh and Sami Sarraj) and Palestine leaders such as Owni Abdel Hadi, Ajjaj Nweihed, and Jamal Husseini took active part. Haj Amin Husseini, Mufti of Jerusalem, was confined to bed, but was in close touch with these leaders. There have been numerous meetings and movements, with Palestine as the centre, partly due to its central position, and partly to the freedom with which it was believed they could act without Government interference, supported by the interest of Haj Amin Husseini. It is clear that a definite policy and course of action for the futureibr all Arab countries have been decided. Owing to the secrecy observed and the very limited circle of discussions it is not yet possible to say with precision the exact details of the programme; reports in this regard vary. It can generally be stated that the leaders aspire for complete independence and an Arab Confederacy. They hold that the independent efforts made locally in each Arab country should be abandoned and a concerted movement replace them; thus in the event of a European war or other emergency, the efforts of the Arabs may be united in one direction. An event in any country (e.g. a strike) may not only cause a reaction in other countries, but lead to a general movement. An organisation with branches in every country is established. In regard to the proposed organisation, the formation of an all-Arab party with headquarters, possibly in Jerusalem, and branches in other countries was decided upon. Whether an all-Arab Congress will be held (in Mecca, Baghdad, or elsewhere), for the purpose, or whether the discussions held in Jerusalem will be considered sufficient is immaterial, but if a Congress is held its task, besides the establishment of an Executive Committee and branches of the pan-Arab party, will be in main to adopt formal decisions, binding representa tives of Iraq, Syria, Palestine, Trans-Jordan, Hejaz, Yemen, Tripolitania, Tunis, etc., to a national pact. Treaties of2 . 'i friendship and cooperation between independent and semi-independent Arab Governments are advocated, particular attention being paid to Iraq and Hejaz. In regard to Palestine Haj Amin Husseini, and many others, hold that the only solution for Palestine and its deliverance from Zionism lies in the establishment of an Arab confederacy and a world Islamic bond. Propaganda in Moslem and Arab countries on behalf of Palestine will increase. Haj Amin has stated that during his visit to Hejaz he succeeded in gaining the sympathy of Ibn Sioud, more important than merely effecting peace; his activities in India are known. As the conflict between the pro and the anti-Mufti parties is believed to be irreparable, the control of the movement in this country should be vested in the proposed pan-Arab bodies. There is also a suggestion for the amalgamation of Palestine and Trans-Jordan with Iraq, as a third step forward towards laying the foundation of an Arab confederation. In Syria the movement is directed by the extreme section of Syrian nationalists. It appears that the nationalists in Syria itself and those abroad, who had separated, have now agreed that the ' , negative ,, policy should be pursued to the end. Interest in Iraq is double. During the reign of Pei sal Iraqi leaders were at the head of the pan-Arabian movement; King Ghazi appears not to show great interest, hence rumours in the press that the Iraqi leaders are averse from committing themselves in the affairs of other Arab countries. In Iraq also party division is stated to be active and the fear has been expressed that it may jeopardise not only the independent life of that country, but also the furthering of pan-Arab schemes, and it appears that all agree that Yassin Pasha Hashimi and Nuri Pasha Said should form a strong Government and take the reins of Iraq in their hands. There is already a tendency in the Egyptian Wafd to support morally, if not materially, all pan-Arab movements. That Hashem el Atassi carried out certain discussions with the Egyptian Wafd and the Syrian elements is known, but it may be a manoeuvre on the part of the Wafd to threaten the British policy and not due to any feeling to share the destiny of other Arab peoples. It is, nevertheless, believed in Arab circles in Palestine that certain Egyptian leaders, who are in touch with King Pouad and Abbas Hilmi, endeavoured to obstruct peace between Ibn Sioud and Imam Yehia owing to the alleged connections of the former, with Italy and the aspirations of the latter to attain Caliphateship, with the assistance of Emir Abdallah and Imam Yehia, in the event of the defeat of Ibn Sioud. Now that he has assured himself against Imam Yehia, Iraq, the Idrisis, and the Hashemite leaders in general, Ibn Sioud is expected by Haj Amin and the others to support the pan-Arab movements.The telegrams exchanged 'between Ahdel Aziz and King Ghazi on the occasion of the Yemenite-Saoudi treaty of ”Islamic friendship and Arah fraternity'’ reveal the feeling of Ihn Sioud. Furthermore, according to press reports Jamil Bey Mardam, (who headed the medical mission to Hejaz), is credited with a statement that Ihn Sioud aims not only at the unity of Arab peoples, hut at the institution of one Arah kingdom, and an understanding exists between Ibn Sioud and the Arah leaders, appropos. The new movement is intended also to include Tripolitania and the neighbouring Moorish countries. Amongst certain leaders who have been approached is Ahdel Aziz Thaalibi, the Tunisian leader, now in Palestine. With feeling in favour of Ihn Sioud, it is expected that opposition to the present regime in Trans-Jordan and propaganda against Emir Abdallah will persist and it is clear in Arah circles that Ihn Sioud will not tolerate any future attempts by Emir Abdalla to interfere with his rule in Hejaz. It may thus he expected a general movement to demand independence will break out with the support of the Moslem world. Immediate efforts will he directed to peaceful means for the spreading of propaganda and organisation. That this is the intention in the beginning at least is clear from such suggestions agreed upon as early delegations to Europe to demand the establishment of Arah unity and propagate the cause of the Arabs, a newspaper in English, French and Arabic, the opening of an Arab Bureau in Europe, assurance to safeguard interests of the British, both economic and commercial, in case of independence, etc. There is no information that any revolutionary activity is contemplated, but once public opinion is aroused and the proposed organisation becomes operative, such schemes as are proposed cannot achieve the desired result without some form of revolutionary activity. Much importance seems to be attached by the Arab leaders to the possible outbreak of a European war, when the Arabs can be in a position to dictate. Reference is necessary to the important role which Haj Amin is playing in this world movement. He is no longer content with the local leadership of Palestine, neither is he much concerned with purely local affairs; he aspires to become a leader of the Islamic world. He takes interest in every movement for the Moslem welfare./fD^&gt; COPY OF P.Z.5476/34. Extract from Periodical Appreciation Summary No.11/34, dated 6th August, 1934. Pan-Islamic Movement. 2. It would appear also that at the meetings referred to above discussions took place respecting the early convocation of the Islamic Congress, which was delayed owing to certain obstructions, and subsequently, to the travels of Ha^ Amin Husseini. 'A1 Jamia al I8lamia ,, in continuation of its pan- Islamic campaign, published a virulent attack on the French administrations in Morocco for alleged atrocities worded in such terms that a party of Moslems, over 50 in number sallied forth from the Mosque in Jaffa in the form of a demonstration and had to be dispersed by the Police. It has been suggested that Sheikh Sleiman el Farouki was moved to write this article, either because of the exclusion of his paper from Syria, or by Italian inspiration by which he is swayed. This form of propaganda by H A1 Jamia al Islamia ,, may mean not only a new Moslem—Christian rift, but alienating the affection of the people from the 'Christian” government of the country. This newspaper has often tried to compete with its Christian rival 'Falastin” on religious lines.14—6130 10292 (2) \NDEXtD r p.

The celebrations in Bagdad were conducted on a more extensive and elaborate scale than usual, and the speeches made in the mosques and else where show that the anniversary has taken on a new significance. 3. Instead of the time-honoured and fantastic recitals of the Prophet’s miraculous feats, embellished by descriptions of his angelic physical grace, long, well-prepared speeches were delivered, dilating upon his character, and those of his attributes and qualities that enabled him and his early successois to build up a vast empire. . . , 4. These speeches appear to have been designed as exhortations to the Arab Moslems to regain their place in the sun by awakening in them a new sense of their pristine glories. 5. I understand that the changes in the nature and extent of the celebrations have been made at the instance of the Government (with little or no encouragement from religious quarters) in order to emphasise the Moslem character of the State of Iraq.

The possible evolution of the national movement which is said to depend on the Congress and the renewed activity of the Young Men’s Executive and of the Istiqlal, appears subject to the influence of pan-Arab and pan-Islamic schemes, and the Palestine Arab case is following a new direction. The effort to remove the Palestine question from a local to an international sphere and to merge it into a world movement is not new. While in Hejaz, Haj Amin Husseini interested the two Arab potentates not only in the Palestine case, but also in the pan-Arab confederacy, also the spirit in which the treaty was drawn up, with frequent references to Arab and Islamic brotherhood, is significant. Advocates of Arab unity have hailed the signing of the treaty as a further linis in the chain of Arab confederacy, the treaty between Iraq and Ibn Sioud being the first link. The division in the past in the sympathy of Arab politicians respecting allegiance to the Hashemites or Ibn Sioud seems to be disappearing with the ascendency of the latter. The death of King Feisal, the inefficiency of Ghazi or ex-King Ali and the unpopularity of Emir Abdalla, all combined influence the leaders in other countries to advance the cause of the victorious Ibn Sioud.• : P.Z.909/34. j / S Copy extracts from letter from Deputy Inspector-General, C.I.D.,Jerusalem, dated 15th January,1934. taken hy the Arab Young Mens Executive to assist in the final disaffiliation of independent Arab Boy Scouts groups from the Baden-Powell Association, and to form a separate general Arab Association. About 30 representatives of such groups met in Jaffa to hear the draft constitution of a new association formulated at the request of the loung Mens Executive. With the exception of one who has been taunted as a Government employee, all representatives approved of the principal points in the constitution regarding disaffiliation with the Baden-Powell and the organisation of an all-Arab Palestine organisation under the honorary presidency of King Ghazi of Iraq, perhaps with the ultimate object of the Palestine organisation becoming a branch of a general Arab organisation. The possibilities of this organisation being exploited as a tool for political purposes and as a means for educating the future generation on principles of hatred to foreign rule, are obvious. previous to the death of King Feisal centred on the amalgamation of Syria and Iraq under one crown and the convocation of an all-Arab Congress, is being diverted into an effort to form an all-Arab party under some such title as the Arab Federation or bnity with branches throughout the Arabian countries, a central council perhaps in Egypt, and a body to defend their case to be composed of the present Syrian-Palestine Delegation in Geneva ana two or three other leaaers. Political leaders will agree to dissolve all existing parties in Palestine, Syria, Egypt, Europe, or America, and affiliate to this one party. The party will apparently be only concerned with Syria, Palestine, Iraq and Trans-Jordan, and will advocate the unity of these countries under one monarchy. Ihsan Bey Jabri on his present trip is mainly concerned with this project and it has been saia that the idea is being favourably received. The formation of such a party, it is argued, is essential to prepare Arab public opinion ana to unite Arab people in view of the expected developments in Europe. Arab Boy Scouts Association. 2.

The visit of Ihsan Bey Jabri, member of the Syrian-Palestine delegation, which has been situated in Europe for several years, is not only for the purpose of assisting in the formation of an all-Arab delegation to effect peace between Ibn Sioud and Imam Yehia or to study the Syrian problem and the advisability of a new delegation to Paris, or, as has been declared, to pay his respects to King Ghazi, but, the opinion has been expressed, also for the purpose of furthering pan-Arab schemes; and the fact that the visit followed so soon the first of a series of articles which Emir Shakib Arslan has commenced to publish, lends colour to this opinion. In carefully couched terms Emir Shakib suggests, amongst other measures, which he opined should not be published and so become accessible to the 'enemy', that accredited representatives of the people of Syria and Palestine should adopt formal decisions denying the rights acquired by post-war settlers in these countries respectively. His reference to unexpected occurrences in the world and the necessity of the Arabs being prepared to benefit from such occurrences is significant. Arab politicians are accustomed to apeak of their sympathies and share, should another European war occur. The suggestion has already been made that the pan-Arab Congress should be convoked at the earliest possible time at a suitable place, perhaps in Palestine, but quietly and without great publicity.fei V' Pan-Arab Al'falrs. 2. Intensification of pan-Arab activity is expected in this country and negotiations on the holding oi an AJ.l-A.iab Congress may be resumed. The movement for holding this Congress was initiated and led in the past by the Palestine Istiqlal Party until, owing to the undue interference of some of its leaders in favour of Ibn Saud, the late King Feiaal caused the project to be indefinitely deferred, but it now appears that, if resumed, the movement will pass out of the hands of the Istiqlal who are, for good reasons, now looked upon as Wahabite propagandists. The outcry raised by them on the approach of hostilities between Ibn Sioud and Imam Yehia was a further indication of their attitude in tuis regard, and it is definitely reported that AJJaJ Nweihed and Izzet Darwazeh have received subsidies from Jedda. In this movement the pro-Council leaders may be expected to come mure to the fore, while the disintegrated opposition factions, having lagged bertad other parties in the recent manifestation! may now attempt to take a share in order to re-instate the Nation’s Party* The Tact has now become clearer thai Iraq will become the centre of gravity of this pan-Arab moveoent and ' that Arab leaders will rally around the young Hashemite King. Runours that the King is opposed by the British Government and that, therefore, the Arabs should all uphold him are discussed.

It appears that Arab politicians in Palestine are turning their face to Iraq rather than to Syria, which is now divined and pre-oocupied in its internal affairs. The all-pervading sympathy shown on the death of King Pei sal and the manifestations on the arrival of the body leave no rcom for doubt that pan-Arab sentiment has reached such a degree that incidents in other Arab countries aie likely to have a re-action in Palestine. Pan-Arebism is no longer a mere pious wish; in Iraq, Syria, Palestine and Trans-Jordan, there are political leaders who have established the strongest possible ties between them, regardless of the differences which separate one territory from the other. The congregation of leaders in laghdad to attend the funeral ceremonies has afforded an opportunity for exchange of views on pan- Arab affairs, and the holding of the Congress to decide on a common programme for the future after the death of King Pei sal. Pollowing the Assyrian incidents, funds in aid of the Iraqian distressed families have been sought in some parts of the country at the instigation of the Istiqlal but, considering the economic state of the country and the various other collections demanded, it is unlikely that any substantial sum can be raised.I P.Z.4089/33.

Z, The visit of King Feisal was an outstanding event in the political situation in view of the unusual manifestation of pan Arad feeling which accompanied this visit. It has called to mind the sweeping enthusiam which reigned during the short reign of King Feisal in Damascus. It has revealed the latent feelings, particularly of Syrians and Palestinians for pan-Arad unity and the confidence which certain sections of them are ready once again to place in King Feisal. This, and other tendencies, may indicate the possidility of the revival of the Arad movement, which existed under the Turks, end which, whatever may de said of its merits and demerits and lack of organisation, may de destined once again to play an Important part and influence the trend of local politics. The pan Arad movement depends for support on the independent Goverrments in Iraq and Hejaz, and efforts to establish unofficial connections with this or that Government have not ceased. Politicians are, however, divided in t$feir sympathies in this respect and try to promote the cause of the Hashemites or Idn Seoud according to their respective affiliations. The difficulties of the amalgamation of Tyria and Iraq under the crown of Feisal seem now to de realisedrealised by Arab politicians, although references to such a scheme continue to be made; and the opinion has been expressed by some that King Feisal has reverted to the policy which it was intended during the early days of the war to pursue: i.e. to place his brother Ali on the throne of Syria. Following the example of Syrians, Palestinian delegations in which the Arab Executive, the Istiqlal and the young men were represented, waited on King Feisal and asked him to intervene in official circles in favour of their case, but they have not, like the Syrians, gone as far as giving him a power of attorney. This was according to a decision reached at a meeting held in Jerusalem and at which a memorandum to be handed to the King embodying Arab demands was drawn up. The expressions of sympathy reported, to have been made by King Feisal to the various delegations and his reference to Arab 'unity and reciprocation of interests tended to encourage pro-nasnemxte feeling. The Palestinian politicians, however, are not all whole-hearted supporters of the Hashemites. An element is still favourably disposed to Ibn Sioud, while the Istiqlal Party contains a strong pro-Wahabite element; this was strongly in evidence at the visit of Yousef Yassin. This element loses no opportunity to spread propaganda in favour of the Wahabite ruler and against the Hashemites M A1 Carmel' is definitely opposed to the various pan-Arab schemes under discussion and mentions the the acquiescence on the part of King Feisal anq/Hashemites towards the Zionist policy. Judging, however, from the recent manifestations in Atman and the attachment which Palestinianf Palestinian and Syrian delegates showed to the person oi King Peisal, it appears that the Hashemite cause is progressing. The concourse of political leaders in Anman end Jerusalem has afforded an opportunity for informal assemblies and political discussions. Iv.any oi ohese leaders were received in audience, possibly by prior arrangements, by King Peisal and his Ministers, while the reports that a meeting of pan Arab leaders with the King and his Ministers will take place in Europe are Reference has been made in some discussions to the hope that Arabs should avail themselves of the first opportunity, such as a state of war in Europe, to rebel against the existing foreign Governments in their countries. may ultimately fail, as the preparatory Committee, of its organisers) has lost the confidence of King Feisal and Yassin Pasha Hashimi. It is doubtful- if either the King or his Minister will continue to support the movement or allow the Congress to be held in Baghdad, and, if it should be held __in Hejas^ lt is doubtful if it will receive universal support from the Arabs. It is not possible to make a definite statement in this regard until further negotiations after Yassin Pasha’s visit to Europe. The Istiqlal Party, on account of its short sighted persistent.

It appears, however, that it (on account of the pro-Ibn Sioud activities of somesighted policy, its excessive enthusiasm and the heterogeneous nature oi its manhership, has not only incurred the opposition o± the strongest political party in Palestine, hut seems also unlikely to attain representation in pan-Arah circles.

Sir Francis Humphrys had, I under stood, already discits^d the matter with His Majesty, who had been so good as to piomise his personal ntt^ryention to prevent any action being brought in the Iraqi courts to dispossess H^sheikh. I added that His Majesty’s Government were most grateful to His Ma&gt;sty for his friendly and helpful attitude in this matter, which was one of some impoH^nce, involving as it did the fulfilment of a pledge given in the name of the Governntei^. leisal leaffiimed his intention to safeguard the sheikh s rights, and added with a smile that he ventured to express his pleasure at this further evidence of the British Government’s fidelity to its pledges. There were other pledges, given about the same time to other rulers in the Middle East, and he felt sure that His Majesty's Government would hold them to be as sacred and bindim” as those gi\en to the Sheikh of Koweit. I gathered that he was referrin 0, to the correspondence with King Hussein, generally known as the McMahon letters. Arab National Policy. . ^ r . om this point King Feisal turned the conversation easily to the subject oi his ambitions for the Arabs. He had, he explained, been most anxious to ha\e an opportunity to discuss this with me, and to express frankly all that was3 in hi* hpart He did not wish to go back into matters which were better, perhaps, J left in the past to which they belonged, but he would like to real! t ' 61 .''’ ! , which he had had with Mr. Churchill (then Secretary of State for the Colonies just before he left England to go to Iraq as a candidate for the throne. A conversation Mr. Churchill had explained a policy which he had agreed to to , and he thought he might say that, since that date, he had worked out that po fn all sinSty and loyalty. He felt now, however, that the stage covered by the Alerstanding entered into with Mr. Churchill had been ‘^versed and a nen stage lav before his country. What path were they to follow .°' n „ P^' bearing'in mind the close alliance into which he had entered with Great Britain he was g most anxious that the policy of his Government m ^d^th that of His Maiesty’s Government. It was for this reason that he would 11 e discuss with me several aspects of the Arab question with which his Governme v.ere^onfmnted des i re( i t0 establish a line of communication between Iraq and the Mediterranean. This could be done either ^ough .yria o Palestine. The Iraqi Government, however, were puzzled to know which route to favour. On the one hand, the manner in which the French mandate had been exercised in Svria gave them no hope that there would in the near future up in Syria a Government favourably disposed to Arab aspirations; aiM on the other hand, although they felt confident of the genera sympathy of His Majesty s Government, the development of Zionism in Palestine gave rise to misgivings concerning the future of the Arabs in Palestine. The ra beino- driven out of Palestine and Transjordan, and would soon be quite unable to withstand the economic and financial strength of the Jews. The potentialities of such a situation made Palestine unattractive as a route for Iraq s line ot communication with the sea. . . . . . . n 15. These problems could, King Feisal explained, in his opinion all be solved if the Arabs worked in harmony with British policy, and continued to enioy British sympathy and support. His aim was to lay down a policy in full Consultation with His Majesty’s Government and thereby to obviate the possibility of embarking on a course of action which might mvohe his Govern ment in serious difficulties with His Majesty’s Government, or even jeopardise the continuance of the happy relations now existing betvveen the two countries. For example, there was a growing desire among peop e in ^aq, and their representatives in Parliament and the Government, to help the Arabs m Syria, and it had been proposed that Iraq, as a member of the League of N M 10I ? S - should in the Assembly, challenge the French application to Syria of the nrincinles of article 22 of the Covenant of the League. What would be the attitude of His Majesty's Government towards such a demarche f Again, so long as Syria remained under a French mandate in its present form, the Iraqi Govern- ment felt obliged to obstruct the development of Syrian communications with Iraq, and across Iraq with Persia, as they feared that, particularly m the north, any facilities given for the development of lines of communication with Syria would te used by the French for the spread of their influence into Iraq. Such a pohcy might involve the Iraqi Government in difficulties with France, to which His Majesty’s Government could not remain indifferent. Here again, he would be g ' a ^16 t replied that I could not, of course, give an immediate opinion on the very important issues which His Majesty had raised. I promised however, to inform my colleagues of the most interesting and valuable conversation which I had had with him, and I undertook that the situation which he had descri &gt;ec should be most fully considered. Arab Congress. 17 I mentioned also the matter of the proposed Arab congress, and explained the view of His Majesty’s Government that the holding of such a congress in Bagdad would, in all probability, cause serious embarrassments for Iraq with^neighbour^iied ^ he attached far more importance to working out with His Majesty’s Government a policy which would offer reasonable hope of bringing about the realisation of Arab aspirations than to the congress, and. provider! such a policy could be agreed upon, he would exercise all his in pence to prevent the congress from being held in Bagdad or elsew here. [851 a—1] B 2 _4 19. I again assured His Majesty that I had listened to his views with the. greatest interest, and I renewed my undertaking to give them the closest consideration and study.-»s INDEXED Itr A ? /C 362: (ji 3119/347/65) iC^- LS FORnIGrN OFFICE* 3../* 1. 20th June, 1933, 3 ^ LIy dear GrilbeFTf^ 3ince I wrote my letter No. E 3014/347/65 of June 12th* about my draft memorandum on the question of Aral unity, it has been decided, as I mentioned orally a few days ago, not to deal with the question of the Arab Congress in that memorandum, but to put up a separate memorandum about it. 2.

Attitude of His Majesty'$ Govetffment towards the Question of Arab Unity. THE phrase “ Arab unity ” is an extremely vague one, which has been used in many different senses. 2. It is generally most in evidence on such occasions as Arab or Moslem congresses, and was freely bandied about during the Moslem Congress at Jerusalem in the autumn of 1931. On such occasions it is generally used extremely loosely as a popular rallying cry against either “Western imperialism ’’ or the Zionist movement; but in actual fact it seldom amounts to much more than a rather undigested idea of co-operation between Arabic-speaking people in matters of education and propaganda, and possibly also in such politico-religious questions as that of the Heiaz Railway, the future of the Holy Places, &amp;c. Arab unity in this sense is something rather akin to pan-Arabism, and appears to have no more practical significance than the rather shadowy pan-Islamic movement, of which so much was heard some twenty years ago. 3. From the political and practical point of view. “ Arab unity ’ ’ should mean the union, either in a single State or in a confederation of autonomous States, of all former Ottoman territories, south of present-day Turkey, which have a predominantly Arab population. This would limit the application of the idea to the north-western half of Arabia, i.e., to the Arabic-speaking territories north-west of a line drawn from the middle of the Persian Gulf to the southern end of the Red Sea. It is, in fact, only to this area that the idea can be regarded as properly applicable, and it is therefore mainly from this point of view that the question is discussed in the present memorandum. But attempts may well be made to extend the idea of Arab unity to the Persian Gulf States and to Southern and South-Eastern Arabia generally. It is thus not possible to consider the problem without touching on its possible relation to these areas also. 4. The idea of Arab unity, as applied to the former Ottoman territories, i.e., to the Arabic-speaking areas north-west of the line mentioned in the preceding paragraph, was the ultimate aim of the Arab revolt during the war, and was the ideal for which the Hashimites, under Hussein and Colonel Lawrence, strove during the war and armistice periods. There is no doubt that the remaining members of the Hashimite family—Feisal, Ali and Abdullah—have never abandoned this dream, although subsequent developments have rendered it impracticable. 5. The most important of these subsequent developments, from the purely Arabian point of view, has been the rise to power of Ibn Baud, and his conquest of the greater part of the Arabian Peninsula,-including the former Kingdom of the Hejaz. The dynastic rivalry between the Hashimites and the Saudis renders it almost inconceivable that there could be any close or organic combination between the territories respectively ruled by them. It is true that King Feisal of Iraq has come to terms with King Ibn Baud and is now in friendly relations with Saudi Arabia, and that we are working hard—with at last a fair hope of success—to secure a similar rapprochement between Ibn Baud and the Amir Abdullah of Transjordan. But the rivalry between the two family systems is still a basic factor in the situation, and unless one group were virtually to disappear, there seems no prospect whatever of any effective combination of the territories at present ruled by Ibn Baud {i.e., the greater part of the Arabian Peninsula, including the former Kingdom of the Hejaz) with those at present ruled by the Hashimites {i.e., the independent Kingdom of Iraq and the mandated territory of Transjordan). While the Arabs are themselves divided into these two camps, any talk of Arab political unity in the wider sense must be illusory. 6. It would, moreover, be impossible in present circumstances for His Majesty’s Government to support either of these groups against the other, since they are bound by special obligations to each. Apart from the support which the Hashimites gave to the Allied cause during the Great W^ar, King Feisal and the 6924 [8732] bAmir Abdullah have in the past shown themselves to be well disposed towaids His Majesty’s Government. It is not necessary to enter into details, but two cases in which the Amir Abdullah, by his co-operation, materially assisted His Majesty’s Government are the Druse rebellion of 1925 and the Palestine disturbances of 1929. Moreover, His Majesty’s Government have a special responsibility to support the Amir Abdullah’s regime, which has been set up in^ Transjordan under their direct protection as mandatory. His Majesty s Govern ment are no less closely bound to King Feisal of Iraq by the Anglo-Iraqi 1 ieat\ of Alliance of 1930. On the other hand, His Majesty’s Government are also bound by special ties to King Ibn Baud in Saudi Arabia. They ha\e maintained friendly and, indeed, cordial relations with Ibn Baud ever since the conclusion or the Treaty of Jedda in 1927. King Ibn Baud has not only continued ;ind developed these friendly relations, but has proved himself one of the very few rulers capable of establishing and maintaining a stable and ordered Government in Arabia. Further, it is important for His Majesty s Government, with their great Moslem interests in India and elsewhere, to remain on friendly terms with the ruler of the Holy Places of Islam. In these circumstances the policy of His Majesty’s Government is to hold the balance evenly between the Hashimites on the one hand and the Saudis on the other, and, while doing all in their power to promote friendly relations between the two, to refrain from any action which might lead to the predominance in Arabia of either House at the expense of the other. . 7. Apart from this major difficulty, there are also other elements m Arabia proper which are unlikely to be capable of combination in any unified system. The most important of these are the independent Kingdom of the Yemen, whose ruler (the Imam Yahia) is short-sighted and quarrelsome, and on uncertain terms both with Ibn Baud and King Feisal, though he ostensibly has treaties of friend ship with both; and the various minor Arabian rulers, such as the Sheikhs of Kovveit, Bahrein, Qatar and the Trucial Coast, who are extremely jealous of each other and of their own independence, and have never shown any sign of capacity for political co-operation. The Sultanate of Muscat and Oman, and the Aden Protectorate need not for the moment be considered in this connexion. On the other hand, if the protagonists of the political idea of ‘ Arab unity ’ were ever to succeed in translating their ideal into practice, it is probable that they would exercise strong pressure on the sheikhdoms of the Persian Gulf and of Southern Arabia, and on the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman, to join in furthering their aim. Such sheikhdoms as Kovveit and Bahrein are in close touch with Iraq and Saudi Arabia, both commercially and politically. Moreover, all these States, including Muscat, maintain a link with Saudi Arabia through the annual pilgrimage to Mecca, which is attended by many members of their ruling families. The pilgrimage offers exceptional opportunities not only for religious and cultural, but also for political, propaganda; and if Mecca were at any time to become a political centre of a united Arabia, or of a great Arabian confederation, it is possible that the political ideal for which it would stand might exercise a considerable attraction over the Arab rulers of the South Arabian and the Persian Gulf States, and stimulate them to a greater desire to co-operate with the leading States of Western and Northern Arabia, at any rate from the negative point of view of combating Western political and cultural influence in the Middle East. 8. As regards the minor Arab States of the Persian Gulf, an important consideration is the fact that, save in the case of the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman (where, however, we exercise a dominating influence), the foreign relations of the rulers concerned are by treaty exclusively conducted by His Majesty’s Government, and that His Majesty’s Government are bound by a series of treaties to give these States varying degrees of protection against foreign aggression and to assist them to maintain their independence. Apart from these treaty obliga tions, it is a basic principle of the policy of His Majesty’s Government in the Middle East that these States should not be absorbed by any of their powerful neighbours, but should remain as far as possible separate units under effective British control. The development of inter-imperial air communications, both civil and military, has in the last few years given this well-established principle a new importance. In the case of Koweit, both Kin^ Feisal of Iraq and King Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia have at various times shown signs of wishing to acquire a hold over this territory, which would be a useful acquisition to either.3 Both on treaty grounds, however, and on grounds of imperial policy, it is important to us that Koweit should not he absorbed by either Saudi Arabia or Iraq. Similarly, as regards Bahrein, apart from our treaty obligations to protect the sheikh against aggression, it would be definitely against British interests that the islands should be absorbed by either Saudi Arabia or Persia. King ''^Ibn Saud has already, by article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda, specifically recognised the special relations of His Majesty’s Government with the Arab States of the Persian Gulf, and is not likely, therefore, to seek to annex Bahrein. Meanwhile, it is one of our main objects in our negotiations with Persia to obtain a similar recognition by Persia of our special relations with Bahrein, &amp;c., and the abandonment of the antiquated Persian claims both to Bahrein and to certain other Arab islands in the Gulf. In these circumstances it would clearly be impossible for His Majesty’s Government to acquiesce in the incorporation of any of the smaller independent Arab States, whether in the Persian Gulf or in Southern Arabia, in a wider Arabian political combination. 9. Meanwhile, in the north and west, any project for Arab unity in any practical sense of the term must come into conflict with the mandatory system in the French Levant States and in Palestine, with all that that system implies. The French, even if they were prepared to agree on certain conditions to the emancipation of the State of Syria proper, have made it clear that they have no intention of relinquishing their hold on the predominantly Christian State of the Lebanon, or, for the present at any rate, on the curious non-Arab enclave of the Jebel Druse. His Majesty’s Government are equally precluded from allowing Palestine to be absorbed in any way in any kind of predominantly Arab union, if only in view of their deep commitment to the policy of the Jewish national home, quite apart from their obligations to the other non-Arab or non-Moslem communities and interests in Palestine proper. 10. From the point of view of practical politics, therefore, the question of Arab unity resolves itself into the possibility of some kind of combination between Iraq, Transjordan and the State of Syria. 11. As regards Transjordan (the union or combination of which with Iraq would at first sight seem easiest, since Transjordan is at present a purely Arab State, and since its ruler is the brother of King Feisal), an initial difficulty is presented by the fact that Transjordan is covered by the mandate for Palestine, of which it technically forms an integral part. It would therefore be necessary, before any effective combination between Transjordan and Iraq could be brought about, that His Majesty’s Government should arrange for the release of Transjordan from the mandate. Transjordan does not, however, at present fulfil any of the conditions which have been laid down by the League of Nations as justifying the release of a territory from the mandatory regime. Even if Transjordan did to some extent fulfil these conditions, a factor which might militate against her liberation from the mandate is the possibility that there may at no distant date be a Jewish settlement in Transjordan. While there can be no question of extending to Transjordan the articles of the Palestine mandate which relate to the establishment of the Jewish national home, the existence of a Jewish minority in Transjordan would certainly increase the difficulties in the way of bringing the mandatory regime in that territory to an end. 12. As regards the State of Syria, there is no doubt that the French are seriously contemplating the possibility of its emancipation, and that King Feisal of Iraq, and Arab nationalists generally both in Iraq and in Syria itself, are considering the possibility of a union of Syria and Iraq, perhaps under the rulership of a single individual. There are, however, various grave difficulties and objections to such a project. 13'. In the first place, the French are unlikely to release their hold on Syria completely. Even if Syria were to be released from the mandate, it is probable that the mandate would be replaced by a Franco-Syrian Treaty of Alliance on the lines of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930. The position would then be that the Svrian portion of the new State, or confederation, whether it took the form of a republic or of a monarchy, would be bound to France, and would remain under predominantly French political and cultural influence, while the Iraqi portion would be bound to this country under the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930 and would remain under predominantly British influence. This might well lead to a situation of international rivalry which would produce serious international complications. [8732] B 25 4*7 7 18. If—as appears likely—the question of the attitude of His Majes y s Government towards the problem of Arab unity is raised in the course o mg Feisal’s impending visit to this country, it is submitted that it should be e .^P aine to His Majesty that the general attitude of His Majesty s Government will e one of friendly sympathy towards any constructive proposals for peacelul economic 4 *^-operation and for the development of close and friendly cultural relations ^Siong the leading States of Arabia; King Feisal could be left f° explain in greater detail exactly what he has in mind; but, since it is not possible tor is Majesty’s Government, for the reasons explained above, and especially m P a . ra ' graphs 6, 8, 9, and 15, to support any policy designed to bring about the unification of Arabia, it seems desirable that any suitable opportunity should e taken to discourage King Feisal emphatically from identifying himselt wi , or committing himself to, such a project. Such discouragement might, tor instance, take the form of advising His Majesty, as Sir Francis Humphrys has already done, that he can best serve the Arab cause by concentrating his energies on e peaceful development of his own country’s resources and institutions, so that the Government of Iraq may serve as a model and a source of encoui agement to o er Arab States. RENDEL. Foreign Office, June 13, 1933. or&gt; £^1 1Z 0/547/65. PROPOSED ARAB COHGBESS, 1. There has lately been much talk of the possibility of holding an Arab Congress in Bagdad this autumn, and Sir &gt;. Humphrys has suggested that it would be well to take the opportunity of King Peisal's visit to this country to discourage His Majesty from pursuing such a project. While the arguments which may be used with King Feisal against the holding of such a Congress must necessarily depend to some extent on the course which the discussion of this question with him may take, the following considerations might be brought to His Majesty's notice. 2. In the first place it is clear that none of the causes which King Feisal may be presumed to have most at heart, e.g. the consolidation and international standing of Iraq or the jj future prospects of the Hashimite family in general, are likely to be furthered by the holding of a pan-Arab Congress, either in Iraq or Palestine or elsewhere at the present time. The proceedings of the Congress, for which King Veisal could not escape a considerable measure of responsibility, could not fail to produce an adverse reaction at least on the ! rench, and therefore not only prove Internationally embarrassing but also render relations between Iraq and Syria more difficult. The opportunity of the Congress would moreover be taken to raise in an acutely controversial form such embarrassing questions for the Hashimite family as that of the Amir Abdullah's attitude towardstowards Jewish settlement in Transjordan, his relations, both now and in the recent past, with King Ibn L ; aud, and his attitude towards certain Arab parties in Palestine itself. Moreover, the Congress would probably, as in the case of the Jerusalem Congress of 1951, give an opportunity to zealots or mischief makers to make anti-foreign speeches which would lead to bitter resentment in foreign countries with koslem interests, such as France and Italy; it would offer a favourable opportunity for anti-Hashimite propaganda and intrigue, and would inevitably tend to intensify the existing divisions in Arab opinion rather than to bring about a spirit of friendly and effective co-operation among Arab peoples. Tome of these arguments have already been used orally with King Feisal by Sir Francis Huaphrys last February and March, and King Feisal then stated that he was most anxious to avoid doing anything which might have the effect of antagonising his neighbours or cause annoyance or embarrassment to His Majesty s Government. There is reason to believe, however, that His Majesty has not yet completely abandoned the idea of a Congress and it is ve^y desirable from every point of view that he should now be strongly urged to make up his mind against its being held at all. 5. In this connexion the Secretary of State for the Colonies and the High Commissioner for Palestine have pressed very strongly that serious risks would follow from the holding of a Pan-Arab Congress in Palestine. It is important that, in discouraging the holding of such a Congress at Bagdad, nothing should be said which might lead to the Congress being held in Palestine instead.

There re a few points of wording which are set out later in this lotter; but, in general, I am quite content with memorandum, except that there is one important amendment which we wish to see introduced (and which I understand Tames mentioned to you yesterday^ in connection with the two additioaal paragraphs dealing with the ^an-ar&amp;b Congress. I refer to the Secretary of State’s very strong feeling a&gt; to the dan ;er of such a Congress in n ulestine and the undesirability of doing anything which might lead to the venue of the proposed congress being transferre c.a.a.I transferred fraa Baghdad to Jerusalem. I think I am right in saying that you have accepted our view that if a eoagroi is to be held, it would be the lesser of two evils if it took place in Iraq rather than in D alestine, and we should therefore like to see introduced at the end oi the memorandum (reluctant as I am to suggest lengthening it!) a the Colonies and the High ComBiissioner for Palestine have pressed very strongly that serious risks would follow from the holding of a Pan Arab Congress in Palestine. It is important that, in discouraging the holding of such a congress at Baghdad, His Majesty’s Government should not say anything which might lead to the venue for the Congress beia; transferred to Palestine. His .t^ajesty’s Government would wish to see the oronosal drooped altogether; but if such a Congress cannot be avoided, it would be a lesser evil, from His Majesty's Governr/ient’s point of view, that it should be held in Baghdad rather than in Palestine”. If you feel able to make an addition on these lines, I do not think I need submit the draft to the Secretary of State, who is very busy indeed at the moment. But in any case final paragraph on the following lines;- M 2l. In this connection the Secretary of State for% \ A I should like Jir Samuel Wilson to see it.

The following are points of wording which I would suggest should be reconsidered:- Paragraph 6, line 1.

They have maintained friendly and indeed eerdlal relatione with Iba Baud ever since the conclusion of the Treaty of 4- Jedda in 1927.

Sven were all these isunediate dynastic and political obstacles to be surmounted, it is very doubtful whether real Arab unity could ever be achieved even between the major states such as iandi Arabia, Iraq, etc*, if only for purely geographical reasons. In actual fact, notwith standing its apparent homogeneity and eompaetness, there le no geographical unity In Arabia.

W. In the first place it Is clear that none of the causes which ling Feisal may be presumed to have mast at heart - e*g* the consolidation and International standing of Iraq or the future prospects of the Hashimlte family in general - are likely to be furthered by the holding of an Arab or Moslem Congress either in Bagdad or elsewhereat th# prasent Ua«. rhc prooa«dlii£8 of the Congroaa* for which foisal could not eweape a ooaal&amp;wrahlo Measure of rewponwiblllty, could hardl/ fail to produce an adTerse roaatlon at least on the £Y*aoh 9 and therefore not only prove internationally oaharraealng hut aloe render relatione between Iraq and iyrla acre difficult* the opportunity of the Congreee would moreover al ioat oertainl/ be taken to raieo in an acutely controversial fom such embarrassing quoetions for the laahlalto family aa that of the Amir Abdullah*a attitude towar le the Jewish Settlement in fraaa Jordan, hi a relations, both now and in the recent pnst, with ling I bn send, and his attitude towards certain Arab parties in Palestine Itself* Moreover, the Congress would almost certainly, as in the case of the Jerusalem congress of 1931, give an opportunity to sealots or mischief makers to make anti-foreign speeches which would load to bitter resentment ia foreign oonntrtm with Moslem interests, saoh as France and Italy* it would offer a favourable oppor tunity for antl-Hashlmlte propaganda intrigue.and would In writ ably fc«md to latoanify the existing diTieione In Arab opialon rather than to bring about a spirit of friendly and ef fee tire •o^operation among *Teb peopleo* dome of these argument* hare already been need orally with ling feieal by dir Fraael* iiumpbryo last February and Maroh 9 and ling Pelaal then stated that he was most anxious to are id doing anything whioh might hare the effect of antagonising his neigh- boars or eanse annoyanse or embarrassment to His Majesty*s Gorernment* i&amp;ere is reason to bellere 9 however 9 that His Majesty has not yet oompletely abandoned the idea of a Congress end It la rery desirable from erery point of riew that he should now be strongly urged to fliahe up his mind against its being held at all.I i ? INDIA OmOB, iSHimALL, 3.S. 1. P.2. 3310/33. l^y dear George, *i l - 8tb June 1953. feany thanJca for your letter of the 7th June, Ko. 5.5500/347/65, enclosing your draft ibacorundum on the subject of Arab unity. 2. Broadly speaking, the Bianorandim seams an excellent statement of the position. 1 have vary few comments to offer and those are almost entirely In respect of the Persian Gull area. Xhey are as follows. 3. In the first place, while it is quite true that in thinking of Arabian politics we must, in present circumstances. Inevitably concentrate on Ibn 3aud on the one hand and the Hashteites on the other, I am not quite sure that it might not be well to emphasise in any sort of general expose of the position that we are really thinking not of ^rabla as a whole, but of western Arabia. Quite a third of the peninsula, if not more, is covered by the dominions of the Persian G.A'. Aendel, Asq., C.M.G., Foreign Office, /. &gt;• 1. Gulf/Gulf ofcoilchst of the Sultan of Muscat arid ^in, of the iMtaMi of the Yemen and of the rulers of the Men Protectorate, and the area in regard to which the question of # Arat) unity* is a real one really confines itself to Syria, Transjordan (possibly)P* lestineIraq and the Hedjaz-Nejd. Paragraph 7 of your note does indeed draw attention to this fact. But you isay think it worth emphasising at a rather earlier point - possibly somewhere in paragraphs 3 to 5? 4. As regards paragraph 7, I agree generally. But I am not quite sure that the importance of the Persian Gulf rtulers, of the Yemen and of the Aden Protectorate is not possibly slightly greater in this connection than the memorandum suggests. The protagonists of ‘Arab unity - , if they were ever to succeed in translating tneir ideal into pmctice, would, I think, be more than likely to exercise strong indirect pressure, in a manner which might prove embarrassing to us, on the Persian Gulf Sheikhdoms, the Sheikhdoms of southern Arabia and on Muscat. Their power to do so is considerably/considerably strengthened by the Importance and closeness of the Pilgrimage link. As you know, not only important States such as Muscat but the quite minor princelings of the irucial Coast 4 Bahrein, etc. - send persons of standing and maftbers of the sheikhly houses on the Pilgrimage, and, if ny recollection is right, we were a little exercised some years ago in connection with Sur by a pilgrimage visit paid by one of the Beni Bu All chiefs. The idea of 'Arab unity* in the broad sense, if it showed the least sith of being realised, might well exercise a very considerable attraction over the rulers of these States and stimulate them to a greater desire to cooperate at our expense with the leading States of Western Arabia. I suggest that some small modification of paragraph 7 to bring out these suggestions, if you accept them, might be desirable. 5* as regards paragraph 8, it would, 1 think, be well to emphasise more definitely the nature of our special treaty relations and of our control. I suggest that the first sentence might possibly be modified to run as follows: *As regards the Arab states of the Persian/Persian Gulf a further Important consideration Is the fact that, save In the case of Muscat, the foreign relations of the rulers concerned are by treaty exclusively conducted by His ii-ajesty's Government (and In the case of Muscat we exercise a dominating Influence), and that His t-ajesty's Government are bound by a series of treaties or understandings to give them varying degrees of protection against forel&amp;i aggression, xtpart...' In the second sentence I would substitute for the words *but should remain...units' the woras 'but should remain, so far as possible, under effective British control, even though they may nominally enjoy the status of Independent units.* In the last sentence of paragraph 8 for 'these minor' substitute 'the' and after 'States* Insert the words 'whether In the Persian Gulf or In southern Arabia.' 6. Paragraph 16. line 3. After 'Arab unity' Insert 'even as between such major Gtates as Iraq, Transjordan, Syria, Hedjaz-Nejd and the Yemen.' 7. Paragraph 17. I quite agree that so far as broad considerations of principle are concerned, we are indeed anxious to keep the major Arabian States which/8 / which are not in special treaty relations with us such as exist in the case of tne Persian Gulf JheirJiao&amp;s ana the liaaramaut in close and friendly relations with each other, hut I think we ought to some extent to qualify the statement in the draft and 1 suggest the insertion in line 5 after the word •movement' of the words 'not incompatible with their special interests or under takings in certain areas to which reference has been made above, which tends, etc.'. ?• * ara^raoh 18. First sub-paragraph, first sentence. I it is undesirable to use any language which may give Feisal the idea that we should see no objection to his extending his operations into our special areas, such as the Persian Gulf sixeikhaoms and Southern Arabia. It will no doubt be possible without difficulty in any oral discussion that may take place to make clear, without throwing uown a challenge, our assumption that tne states with which he is concerned are the major states of western Arabia# Third line from end on first page, before 'of Arabia* delete 'of' and insert 'even of the major States of western'.3* I send these provisional co&amp;ments at once, in view ol the urgency ol the iiiatter.

You may remember that on May 2nd I wrote you a letter (No. E 1732/347/65) in which 1 asked for your views on a draft Memorandum which I had prepared on the subject of Arab unity, etc. You will now have received a copy of Parkinson’s letter (No. 1B15P/33_I of May 11th to me, making certain suggestions for the revision of that Memorandum. 2. The matter has now become rather urgent as I understand that Humphrys may wish to raise the subject with our Secretary of State next week, and it will thus be necessary to have our material readily available. I have therefore revised the draft Memorandum in the light of Parkinson's observations, and send you a ^copy of my revised draft herewith. I have also, at Humphrys suggestion, added a paragraph on the subject of the / r\ k m ^Jj /proposed J. G. Laithwaite, Esq.proposed Pan-Arab Congress at Bagdad. As you know, all the Departments of His Majesty^ Government concerned are anxious if possible to prevent this Congress from being held, and Humphrys thinks that it would be well if our Secretary of State could take the matter up with King Feisal at his first interview. 3. I should be very grateful if you could let me have any observations on this draft - and in particular on the parts dealing with the Persian Gulf, etc., - as soon as possible. 4. I am sending a copy of this letter and of the enclosed revised draft Memorandum to Parkinson. Yours ever.THK QUK3TIQH QF AR/&gt;B UNITY . 1* The phrase Arab Unity’' is an extremely vague one, which has been used in many different senses. 8. It is generally most in evidence on such occasions as Arab or Moslem congresses, and was freely bandied about during the Moslem Congress at Jerusalem in the autumn of 1931. On such occasions it is generally used extremely loosely as a popular rallying cry against either 'Western Imperialism' or the Zionist movement; but in actual fact it seldom amounts to much more than a rather undigested idea of co-operation between Arabic-speaking people in matters of education and propaganda, but to some extent also in such politico-religious questions as that of the Hejaz railway, the future of the j^.v .laces, etc* Arab unity in this sense is something rather akin to pan-Arabism, and appears to have no more practical significance than the rather shadowy pan-Islaaic aoveaen*,of which so much was heard some ten or twenty years ago. 3. Froji the political and practical point of view, 'Arab Unity’* should mean the union, either in a single State or in a confederation of autonomous States, of all former Ottoman territories, south of present day Turkey, which have a predominantly Arab population. 4. This was indeed the ultimate aim of the Arab revolt during the war, and was the ideal for which the Hashimites under Hussein and Colonel Lawrence strove during the war and arraistice periods. There is no doubt that the surviving members of the Hashimite family - Felsal, Ali and Abdullah - have never abandoned this dream, although subsequent developments have rendered it wholly impracticable. 5. The most important of these subsequent developments, from the purely Arabian point of view, has been the rise to power of Ibn Baud, and his conquest of the greater part of if* 1 *- Ha* V* the/x-ffz) ‘ 5c Iv 9^ rfw rm the Arabian peninsula, including the former Kingdom of the Hejas. The dynastic rivalry between the Haahlmltes and the Saudis renders it almost inconceivable that there could be any close or organic combination between the territories respectively ruled by them. It is true that King Peisal of Iraq has come to terms with King Ibn Saud and is now in friendly relations with Saudi Arabia, and that we are working hard - with at last a fair hope of success - to secure a similar rapprochement between Ibn Saud and the Amir Abdullah of Transjordan. But the rivalry between the two family systems is still a basic factor In the situation, and unless one group were virtually to disappear, there seems no prospect whatever of any effective combination of the territories at present ruled by Ibn Saud (i.e. the greater part of the Arabian peninsula, including the former kingdom of the Heja*), with those at present ruled by the Hash!mites (i.e. the independent Kingdom of Iraq and the mandated territory ofTransjordan). While the Arabs are themselves divided into these two great groups, any talk of Arab f-^.itical unity in the wider sense must be illusory. 6. It would, moreover, be impossible for His Majesty's Government to support either of these groups against the other, since they are bound by special obligations to both sides. Apart from the support which the Heshlmltes gave to the allied cause during the Great War, King Peisal and the Amir Abdullah have in the past shown themselves to be well-disposed towards His Majesty’s Government. It is not necessary to enter into details, but two recent cases in which the Amir Abdullah has, by his co-operation, materially assisted His Majesty's Government are the Druse rebellion of 1926, and the Palestine disturbances of 1929. Moreover, His Majesty's Government are bound to King Peisal of Iraq by the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of Alliance of 1960, and have a special responsibility to support the Amir Abdullah’s regime/regime which has been set up in Transjordan On the other hand Hie Majesty’s Government are bound by special ties to King Ibn Saud in b&amp;tdi Arabia. They have maintained friendly and indeed cordial relatione with Ibn baud ever since the conclusion of the Treaty of Jedda in 1927. King Ibn baud has not only maintained and developed these friendly relations but has proved himself capable of establishing and maintaining a stable and ordered Government in Arabia. It is moreover important for His Majesty’s Government with their great Moslem interests in India and elsewhere, to remain on friendly terms with the ruler of the Holy Places of Islam. In these circumstances all that His Majesty’s Government can do is to attempt to hold the balance evenly between the Hashlmltes on the one hand and the baudis on the other, and, while doing all in their power to promote friendly relations between the two, to refrain predominance in Arabia of either house at the under their direct protection as mandatory from any action which might lead to theexpense of the other 7. Apart from this major difficulty, there are alg£&gt; other elements in Arabia proper which are unlikely to be capable of combination in any unified system. The most important of these are the independent kingdom of the Yemen, whose ruler Is short-sighted and quarrelsome and on uncertain terms both with Ibn Saud and King Faisal, though he ostensibly has treaties of friendship with both; and the various minor Arabian rulers, such as the Sheikhs of Koweit, Bahrain, Qatar and the Trucial Coast, who are extremely jealous of each other and of their own independence, and have never shown any sign of capacity for political co-operation. The Sultanate of Muscat and Oman and the Aden Protectorate need not for the moment be considered in this connexion. 8« As regards the minor Arab States of the Persian Gulf, a further important consideration Is the fact that His Majesty^ Government are . ^ bound by a series of treaties to give them varying/varying degrees of protection against foreign aggression and to assist them to maintain their independence. Apart from tneee treaty obllgations 9 it is a basic principle of the policy of His Majesty’s Government in the Middle Kast that these States should not be absorbed by any of their powerful neighbours, but should remain as far as possible free and Independent units* The development of inter- imperial air communications, both civil and military, has, in the last few years, given this well-established principle a new Importance. In the case of Xowelt, both King Feisal of Iraq and King Ibn 3aud of Saudi Arabia have at various times shown signs of wishing to acquire a hold over this territory, which would be a useful acquisition to either. Both on treaty grounds, however, and on grounds of imperial policy, it is important to us that Kowelt should not be absorbed by either Saudi Arabia or Iraq. Similarly as regards Bahrain, apart from our treaty obligations to protect the Sheikh against aggression,/aggression, it would be definitely against British interests that the islands should be absorbed by either Saudi Arabia or Persia. King Ibn Baud has already, by Article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda, specifically recognised the special relations of His Majesty’s Government with the Arab States of the Persian Gulf and is not likely therefore to seek to annex Bahrain. Meanwhile it is one of our main objects in our negotiations with Persia to obtain a similar recognition by Persia of our special relations with Bahrain etc., and the abandonment of the antiquated Persian claims both to Bahrain and to certain other Arab Islands in the Gulf. In these circumstances it would clearly be impossible for His Majesty’s Government to acquiesce in the incorporation of any of these minor independent Arab States in a wider Arabian political combination. 9. Meanwhile in the north and west any project for Arab unity in any practical sense of thm word must come into conflict with the/■* J T - the mandatory system in the French Levant States and in Palestine, with all that that system implies. The French, even if they were prepared to agree, on certain conditions, to the emancipation of the State of Syria proper, have made it clear that they have no intention of relinquishing their hold on the predominantly Christian State of the Lebanon, or, for the present at any rate, on the curious non- Arab enclave of the Jebel Druse. His Majesty T s Government are equally precluded from allowing Palestine to be absorbed in any way in any kind of predominantly Arab union, if only in view of their deep commitment to the policy of the Jewish national home, quite apart from their obligations to the other non-Arab or non-Moslem Communities and interests in Palestine proper. 10. From the point of view of practical politics, therefore, the question of jtrab unity resolves itself into the possibility of some kind of combination, providing for the inclusionof indigenous non-Arab elements such as the Assyrians, Kurds, etc,, between Iraq, Transjordan and the State of Syria, /■'V 11* As regards Transjordan, the union or combination of which with Iraq would at first sight seem easiest, since Transjordan is at present a purely Arab State and since its ruler is the brother of King Peisal, an initial difficulty is presented by the fact that Transjordan is covered by the mandate for Palestine, of which it technically forms an integral part. It would therefore be necessary, before any effective combination between Transjordan and Iraq could be brought about, that His Majesty’s Government should arrange for the release of Transjordan from the mandate. Transjordan does not, however, at present appear to fulfil any of the conditions which have been laid down by the League of Nations as Justifying the release of a territory from the mandatory regime. Even if Transjordan did to some extent fulfil these/theee conditions &amp; factor which might militate against her liberation from the mandate is the | possibility that there may at no distant date be a Jewish settlement in Transjordan. While there can be no question of extending to Transjordan the articles of the Palestine mandate which relate to the establishment of the Jewish national home, the existence of a Jewish minority in Transjordan would certainly increase the difficulties in the way of bringing the mandatory regime in that territory to an end. 12. As regards the State of Syria, there is no doubt that the French are seriously contemplating the possibility of its emancipation, and that King Feisal of Iraq, and Arab nationalists generally, both in Iraq and in Syria itself, are considering the possibility of a union of Syria and Iraq, perhaps under the wilership of a single individual. There arc, however, various difficulties and objections to such a project. 13. In the first place, the French are unlikelyto release their hold on Syria completely. Even if Syria were to be released from the mandate it is probable that the mandate would be replaced by a Franco-Syrlan Treaty of Alliance on the lines of the ,jiglo-Iraql Treaty of 1930. The position would then be that the Syrian portion of the new State, or confederation, whether it took the form of a republic or of a monarchy, would be bound to France, and would remain under predominantly French political and cultural influence, while the Iraqi portion would be bound to this country under the Anglo-Iraqi treaty of 1930 and would remain under predominantly British influence. This might well lead to a situation of international rivalry which would produce serious international complications. 14. Again, Syria is at present in a higher state of development than Iraq. Although its people are perhaps leas virile, its towns are larger and more flourishing, and its culture and civilisation are more advanced. In anycase, it is a far more agreeable country to live in. It is probable, therefore, that Iraqis would be increasingly attracted to the Syrian towns of Damascus and Aleppo, and thus perhaps also to the even more definitely French district of the Lebanon or town of Beirut, and that Syrian — and thus French - influence would tend to establish itself increasingly in Iraq proper. The capital of the new State might even be moved to Damascus, which is an infinitely pleasanter town than Bagdad, and as a result Franco-Syrian influence might spread eastwards until the whole character of Iraq and of the political relationship between His Majesty*a Government and that country might be transformed. It is clear that the immediate Interests of His Majesty's Government, particularly in regard to the safety of inter-Imperial communications, which have been so carefully protected by the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930, would suffer serious injury as the result of such a development. 15. The questions dealt with in paragraphsNo®. 12, 13 and 14 above were considered by the Ministerial Middle East sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence on November 17th, 1931, and the relevant conclusions then reached ran as follow®:- (1) That the outcome most likely to be to the advantage of His Majesty's Government would be the constitution of Syria as a republic with a Syrian as President; (2) That for a single individual to hold the crowns both of Syria and Iraq would be moat undesirable, and would, in any case, be likely to prove un workable ; (5) That any attempt by King Feisal to transfer his crown from Iraq to Syria would be contrary to British interest®. 16. Even were all these immediate dynastic and political obstacles to be surmounted, it is very doubtful whether real Arab unity could ever be achieved, if only for purely geographical reasons. In actual fact, notwithstanding its apparent homogeneity and compactness, there is no geographical unity in/in Arabia The northern countries, such as Iraq, Syria, Palestine and Transjordan, all differ wlftely from each other in configuration, soil, climate and general character• Southern &gt; Arabia, although it appears to possess a certain unity from a first glance at the map, can really more accurately be described as an archipelago of human settlements in a sea of desert, inhabited by tribes who are driven by the exigencies of desert life into becoming, as it were, land pirates ceaselessly preying on each other. Any idea of unity or confederation based on the ordinary Kuropean conceptions which such words suggest is quite Inapplicable to an area of this type. 17. But from the point of view of general international co-operation and understanding, of cultural development, and of economic prosperity, His Majesty’s Government can naturally only view with sympathy any movement which tends to bring the peoples of the Arabian countries into closer N and more friendly relations with each other.They have Indeed always done whatever has been possible to this end. The improvement of the last years in relations between Iraq and Saudi Arabia has been mainly due to the efforts of His Majesty's Government, who brought about the reconciliation between King Peisal and King Ibn Saud on board H.M.S. 'Lupin' in February 1930. His Majesty's Government are now actively engaged in trying to bring about a similar improvement in relations between Saudi Arabia and Transjordan, and hope that these may lead to the conclusion of a treaty settlement, including treaties of friendship and bon volsinage, between King Ibn Saud and L the Amir Abdulld,; corresponding to the treaty settlement concluded between Saudi Arabia and Iraq in April 1931. His Majesty's Government have moreover always sought to further the close co-operation of the Arab countries in economic matters, and have succeeded in securing for Iraq and Transjordan, by suitable provisions in the relevant instruments, the right/right to accord specially favourable tariff treatment to neighbouring Arab States, not withstanding their most-favoured-nation obligations to other countries. 16. Should the question of the attitude of His Majesty^ Government towards the problem of Arab unity be raised in the course of ring Feisal’s impending visit to this country, it is submitted that it should be explained that the general attitude of His Majesty's Government will be one of friendly sympathy towards any constructive proposals for peaceful co-operation and for the development of close and frimndly relations among the Arab countries; King Pelsal could be left to explain in greater detail exactly what he has in mind; but, since it is not possible for His Majesty's Government, for the reasons explained above, and especially in paragraphs 6, 8 and 15, to support any policy designed to bring about the political unification of Arabia, it seems desirable that any suitable opportunity should be taken to discourage King Pelsal from identifying himself with, or committing rcommitting himself to, such a project. Such discouragement might, for instance, take the form q£ advising His Majesty, as Sir Francis Huraphrys has already done, that he can best serve the Arab cause by concentrating his energies on the peaceful development of his own country’s resources and institutions, so that the Government of Iraq may serve as a model and a source of encouragement to other Arab states. 19. In any case Sir ?. Humphrys has suggested that it would be well to do whatever may be possible to discourage King Feisal from holding a Pan Arab Congress in Bagdad, as it has been proposed that he should do this autumn. While the arguments which may be used with King Fe^al against the holding of a Congress must necessarily depend to some extent on the course which the discussion of this aspect of the question with him may take, the following considerations might perhaps usefully be brought to His Majesty’s notice! 20. In the first piece it is clear that none of the causes which King Feisal may presumed to nave most at heart - e.g. the consolidation and international standing of Iraq, or the future prospects of the Hashimite family in general - are likely to be furthered by the holding of an Arab or Moslem Congress either in Bagdad or elsewhere at the present time. The proceedings of the Congress, for which King Feiaal could not escape a considerable measure of responsibility, could hardly fail to jpjgpduce an adverse reaction at least on the French, and therefore not only prove internationally embarrassing but also render relations between Iraq and Syria more difficult. The opportunity of the Congress would moreover almost certainly be taken to raise in an acutely controversial form such embarrassing questions for the Hashiaite family as that of the Amir A Abdulla^s attitude towards the Jewish Settlement in Transjordan, his relations, both now and in the recent past, with King Ibn Saud, and his attitude towards certain Arab parties in Palestine itself. Moreover, the Congress would almost/almost certainly, as in the case of the Jerusalem congress of 1931, give an opportunity to *~^lot8 or mischief makers to make anti- forergr*\.speeches which would lead to bitter % resentment in foreign countries with Moslem interests, such as Prance and Italy; it would offer a favourable opportunity for anti- Hashimite propaganda intrigue, and would inevitably tend to intensify the existing divisions in Arab opinion rather than to bring about a spirit of friendly and effective co operation among Arab peoples. Some of these arguments have already been used orally with King Peisal by Sir P. Humphrys last February and March, and King Feisal then stated that he was most anxious to avoid doing anything which might have the effect of antagonising his neighbours or cause annoyance or embarrassment to His Majesty’s Government, There is reason to believe, however that His Majesty has not yet completely abandoned the idea of a Congress and it is very desirable from every point of view that he should now be strongly urged to make up his mind against it, being held at all.Street, v • •% * \ y // kay # 1935 # Hy dear Hcndel, .

(2) I think we should bring in the main purport of the secret despatch to Trans-Jordan on Arab policy, which was sent on the 1st February last. That is to say, we want to state somewhere in the memorandum that it is the policy of His uajesty f 3 Government to support Ibn Gaud* s regime in Saudi Arabia and the Hashimlte regime in Iraq and Trans-Jordan* That policy, having regard to the relations between Ibn GaudSTW'-i&amp;fm Gaud and the HaaJnlmite.i, is not compatible with any iche e of Arab political ouity which would embrace ;'&gt;audi Arabia, Iraq and Tr^naWordan* Possibly this might be worked in towards the end of paragraph 5 of your raeraoranduB* (3) light not something rather mor&amp; a pacific be said about Imperial interests, riz. the air route, pipeline and Haifa»haghdad railway? (4) vhile there can be no question of extending to Transjordan the articles in the Palestine Mandate which relate to the establishment of a Jewish national home in Palestine, we must t dee into account the possibility that some time there will be Jewish Ok. settlement in Transjordan. This means,Jewish minority in an Arab state, and in the specie! circumstances it would be a reason (see paragraph 9 of the memorandum) for retention of the mandatory rtfgime in Transjordan, or at any rate for not being in a hurry to t ;ire up the mandate. Is it worth while making this point? I do not press it, but it is as well to raise it. (S)(5) X aa not sure whether the interests of Hie Majesty*s Government in the Persian Gulf are euffic. ^ntly grrphaaised, bat that is more for the India Office than for the Colonial Office, and X have no doubt that L&amp;ithwaite, to whom you have will also writ ten,/ralce any suggestions which he thinks necessary. (6) An regards the concluding *ara jra jh of the aeuor ndum. X should like, if possible, to be rather more definite in indicating that His Majesty’s Government are not in favour of Arab oolitic::.! unity.

One further point: should not the Air Ministry be given an opportunity to see a draft before It SS»i.hS1«it la finalised? They are ooocsmsd in the general question and they are likely to have views about Abe air route and other 'Imperial interests** Z am sending a copy of this letter to LaithwaiteCOPY (E 1732/347/65) SECRET \ \ v\ l A'. ^ r ^.C c V*' My dear Gilbert, Some time ago Humphry's suggested privately that the Foreign Office should prepare a short treatise on the attitude of His Majesty’s Government towards Arab unity, and that this should be done before King Feisal comes to London in June, since, in Humphrys’ opinion, King Feisal is sure to raise the subject in one form or another during his visit. 2. The phrase ’’Arab unity” is so vague and has been used in so many different senses that it is not easy to define the attitude of His Majesty’s Government towards it. I have, however, tried my hand at the preparation ol a note on the subject and enclose the result. 3. I wonder if you could some time or other find time to glance at it and let me know whether you concur in the general lines which I have followed and in the conclusions reached? I shall be very glad of any suggestions you may like to make for its improvement or modification.1. The phrase ,f arah unity 7 la an extremely vague one, which has been ue^d in i .any different senses. 2* It is generally must in evidence on such occasions as Arab or Moslem congresses, and was freely bandied about during the Moslem Congress at Jerusalem in the autumn of 1931. On such occasions it is generally used extremely vaguely as a pooular rallying cry against either ’’western imrerialisra' or the Zionist movement; but in actual fact it seldom amounts to much more than a rather undigested idea of eo-ooeration between ^Tabic- epeaking people in matters of education and propaganda, but to some extent also in such politico-religious questions as that of the Fejaa railway, the future of the Holy places, etc. Arab unity in this sense is something rather akin to pan-.rabism, and appears to hav« no more practical significance than the rather shadowy pan-Islamic movement, of which eo much was heard some ten or twenty years ago. 3. From the political and r -ctioal point of view, ’Arab unity’ should mean the union, either in a single State or in a confederation of autonomous States, of all former Ottoman territories south of present day Turkey, which h ve a predominantly . mb population. 4. This w? s indeed the ultimate aim of the Arab revolt during the war, and was the ideal for which the HashimiteaHashiaiiWs under Hussein and Colonel Lawrence strore during the war anl armistice periods. There is no douht that the surviving memhers of the Hashimite family - ‘oiaal, Ali and i bdullah - have never abandoned this iream, although subsequent developments have rendered it wholly impracticable. 5. The most important of these subseoaent developments, from the purely Arabian point of vi w, has been the rise to power of Tbn saud, and his conquest of the greater part of the Arabian peninsula, including the former Kingdom of the nejaz. ™he dynastic rivalry between the Hashimites and the ‘audis renders it almost inconceivable that there could be any close or organic combination between the territories respectively ruled by them. It is true thrt King I^eisal of Iraq has come to terms with King Ibn rfaud and is now in friendly relations with Saudi Arabia, and that we are worfcing hard - with at last some slight hope of success - to secure a similar rapprochement between Ibn &gt;aud and the Abdullah of Transjordan, ^ut the rivalry between the two family systems is still a basic factor in the situation, and, unless one group were virtually to disappear, there seems no Droapect whatever of any effective combination of the territories at oresent ruled by T hn 3aud (i.e. the greater part of the Arabian '’eninsula. Including the former kingdom of the Fejaz) with those at present ruled by the Hashinitea (i.e. Iraq and Transjordan). hile the Arabs are themselves divided into these two great groups, any talk of ;,rab political unity in the wider sense must x &gt;e illusory. 6 . Apart from this major question, there are also other elements in Arabia roper which are unlikely to be capable T combination in any unified system. m he most important of theie arear© the independent kingdom of the Yemen, whose ruler is shortsighted and quarrelsome and on uncertain terms both with Ihn Baud and with king Feisal, though he ostensibly has treaties of friendship with both; and the various minor Arabian rulern, such as the heikhs of Kowcit, Bahrein find the racial Coast, who are extremely Jealous of e *ch other and of their own ind pendence, and have never Bhown any 8i&gt;&gt;n of c pj city for political co-operation. 7. meanwhile* in the north and west, any project for Arab unity in any practical sense of the word must come into conflict with the mandatory systems in the French levant states and in ialestine, with all their implications. The French, even if they were repared to agree,*on certain conditions, to the emancipation of the State of Syria proper, h= ve made it clear that they have no intention of relinquishing their hold on the predominantly Christian iitate of the Lebanon, or, for the .resent 8t any rate, on the curious non-Arab enclave of the Jebel Druse* His Majesty^ Government are equally precluded from allowing iraleetine to be absorbed in any way in any kind of predominantly Arab union, if only in view of their deep commitment to the policy of the Jewish national home, quite apart from their obligations to the other non-,rah or non-voslem Communities and interests in Palestine proper. 8. From the point of view of ractical politics, therefore, the question of arab unity resolves itself into the possibility of some kind of combination, providing for the Inclusion of non-^rab elements, between Iraq, Transjordan and the State of Syria. 9. as regards errant j or dan, the union or combination of whichwhich with Iraq would at flrat 8l*-:ht Beam easiest, tsinca / ' ranaJordan is a urely arab ,ta -© and since its ru^e *■ hrother of £ing Feiaal, an initial difficulty is preeented by the fact that Transjordan is covered by the mandate for Palestine, of which it technically forms an integral part* It would therefore he necessary, before-*any effective combination j between Transjordan and Iraq could be brought about, that His majesty's (government should arrange for the release of Transjordan from the mandate* It is most doubtful whether Transjordan at oresent fulfils any of the conditions which have been laid down by the League of Kations as Justifying the release of a territory from the nan atory rdgime. Added to this, the Amir ^bdullah has proved a disappointing ruler, and has shown himself to be so shortsighted and untrustworthy that it is difficult to see how His majesty*s Government could recommend 'TansJordan under his rule for emancipation. A.t the same time it is difficult to see how he could be deposed or replaced, without unfortunate reactions on the Jew^&amp;rab situation in * Palestine* 10. i.s regards the itate of oyria, there is no doubt that the French ar© seriously contca lating the possibility of its emancipation, and that King Feisal of Iraq and A rab nationalists. both in Iraq and in Syria itself, are considering the possibility of a union of Syria and Iraq* There are, however, vprioas difficulties and objections to such a project. 11* In the first place, the French are unlikely to release their hold on Syria completely. Ten if Syria wore to be released from the mandate, it is orobable that the mandats , would be replaced by a Franco-Syrian Treaty of Alliance on the lines of the Anglo-lraqi Treaty of 1920. he position would thenthen ba that tha a^rian portion of the ow .itat©» or confedera tion, would be bound to /Thnce, and would r naln under predominantly !^rench nolitieal and cultural influance t while the Iraqi portion would be bound to this country and under predominantly British influence. This mi^ht well load to a situation of international rivalry which would produce serious international complioetlona. 12. A^ain, Syria is at present in a hi her rtate of development than Iraq. Although its eople are perhaps lees virile, ita towns are 3arp,t r and more flourishim , and its culture and civilisation are more advanced. In any cttae. It is a far more agreeable country to live in. It is probable, therefore, that Iraqis would be increasingly attracted to the -yrian towns of Damascus and Aleppo, and t) uo rerhupa also to the even more French town of heirut, and that Syrian - and thus French - influence would tend to establish itself increasingly in Iraq proper. The capital of the iiew state might wven be moved to Dfcuatiscufc, which ia an infinitely pleasanter town than Bagdad, and aa a result Franoo-3frlan influence might spread eastwards until the whole character of Iraq and of the political relationship Between Hie hajeety'e Government and that country might be transformed. It is clear thut the immediate internets of His Majesty*6 Government, particularly in regard to the fety of inter-imperial cornualeatlone, which have been so care fully t&gt;rotected by the /.nglo-lraqi Treaty of 3 9?0, wou-id suffer serious Injury as the result of such a development. IS. hven wore all these immediate dynastic and political obstacles to be surmounted it is very doubtful whether real Arab unity could ever be achieved, if only for purely geographical roaeons. In actual fact, notwithstanding its apparentapparent homogeneity and compactness, there is no geo raphical unity in Arabia* The orthern countries, such as Iraq, Syria, Palestine and Transjordan, all differ widely from each other in oonfimratlon, eoil, olinate and general charnotrr. ioat^ern Arabia, although it appears to noesess a certain unity from a first glance at the map, can really more accurately be described ae an archinelago of hunan settlements in a sea of desert, inhabited by tribes who are dr Iren by the exigencies of desert life into becoming, as it were, lend n irate s ceaselessly rre^ ln&lt;? on e? : &lt;ch other, iuiy idea of unity or confederation baaed on the ordinary European conceptions which such words suggest seems hopelessly inapplicable to on area of this type, 14, ^ut from the point of view of general international co-operation and understanding, of cultural development, and of economic prosperity. His Majesty's aovernment can naturally only view with sympathy any movement which tends to bring the peoples of the Arabian countries into closer and more friendly relations with each other, They have indeed always done whatever hae been possible to thia end. The improvement of the lest few years in relations between Iraq arid 3audi Arabia has been mainly due to the efforts of His Majesty's Sovernment, who brought about the reconciliation between King ^eisal snd King Ibn Baud on board I!*iUS* *Lupin* in February 1930. Kia Majesty's Government are now actively engaged in trying to bring about a corresponding improvement in relations between S&amp;udi Arabia and Transjordan, and hope that these may lead to the conclusion of a treaty settlement, including treaties of friendship arid bon voielnage, between King Tbn ;;eud and the Amir Abdulla, corres ponding to the treaty settlement concluded between jjaudi Arabia and Iraq in April 1931, His Majesty's Government have moreover always mim&amp;zrnFfalways soiiF'ht to furthar the close co-oper^tlon of the xrah countries in economic nattere, and hare succeeded in sesurln* t ,; &gt;r Iraq and Transjordan, h. suitable ^roTisions in the relevant instruments, the ri^ht to accord specially favourable tariff treatment to neighbouring Arab Statee, notwithstanding their most-favoured-nation obligations to other countries. lb.

March 20, 1933. ^ CONFIDENTIAL. 1933 Section 2. [E 1469/347/65] No, 1. Sir F. Humphrys to Sir John Simon.—(Received March 20.) (No. 143.) Sir, Bagdad, March 9, 1933. WITH reference to my telegram No. 30 of the 25th February, I have the honour to report that at a recent audience which I had with King Feisal His Majesty confirmed the undertaking which he had given me privately, while I was on a shooting trip with him at Amara, that the Arab Congress would be post poned, at any rate, until the autumn, and I enclose a translation of a cutting from the Arabic newspaper the Tariq, which shows that the news of the postponement has been received locally with considerable regret. 2. His Majesty informed me that he had carefully thought over the warnings which I had given him that the holding of the congress in Bagdad might have the effect of antagonising his neighbours, and said that he was most anxious to avoid doing anything which might cause annoyance or embarrassment to His Majesty's Government. He asked me, however, to acquaint him with the general attitude of His Majesty’s Government towards the ideal of Arab unity which he had so much at heart. Was it the same attitude as that which had been explained to him in 1921, or had we changed our views since then? For 3. I thanked His Majesty for listening to my advice, and said that opportunities would no doubt occur during his visit to England and the Continent next summer for considering this problem from a wider point of view than that which had been presented to him locally by Palestinian and Syrian extremists. I recognised, however, that His Majesty had consistently entertained the ambition of furthering the unity of Arab peoples, particularly in their cultural and economic development. The danger I foresaw was that the attention of the congress would almost exclusively be directed towards the realisation of the political unity of the Arabs at a time when the discussion of such a question could hardly fail to excite the suspicions of his neighbours. I felt that His Majesty could best serve the Arab cause by concentrating his energies on the development of his own country’s resources and institutions, so that the Govern ment of an independent and enlightened Iraq might serve as a model and an encouragement to other Arab countries. 4. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s representatives at Cairo, Tehran, Jerusalem, Istanbul, Jedda and Beirut. (Translation.) WE learn with deep regret that the Arab Conference, which it had been decided to hold in Bagdad next month, has been postponed for next autumn. It is hoped that the reasons for this postponement are not such as will affect the great hopes cherished by the advocates of independence for the Arabian countries. himself, he could only say that he had always attempted to follow in the Middle East the policy which he believed to have the approval of His Majesty's Govern ment.

Pan-Arab Movement, _ 4 * 0 * &amp;%) *5^3 In regard to the Pan-Arab movement, no progress has been made owing to the conflict of two different forces, which aspire at the domination of the proposed Congress; namely the pro-Ibn Sioud and the pro-Peisal elements. The former consisting principally of Nebih el Asmeh, Kamel el Kassab, and Shuleri ‘.uatli who, together with the Istiqlal Party, actually control the Preparatory Committee, which is responsible for all necessary arrangements and negotiations. The latter consist of Haj Amin Husseini assisted by Amin Tamimi and others who may have been moved not solely by their connections with Peisal, but by party considerations and rivalry for supremacy. Having realised that the Congress is a certainty and that the majority of proposed delegates were selected by the Preparatory Committee (who were in favour of Ibn Sioud). Haj Amin Husseini decided to intervene, He caused King Peisal to be approached it is reported, through Tahsin Kadri and the Iraqi Consul in Syria, suggesting that King Faisal should not agree to ‘.he arrangements made by sympathisers of Ibn Sioud. He has the collaboration of certain/certain Syrian and Lebanese leaders, known for their pro-?eisal sympathies, and has threatened to boycott the Congress, if sheikh Kamel Kassab and his associates accept their nominations. It is possible that the impending visit to Palestine of Emir Adel Arslan is to study the situation in this regard.1 A « mm C.Qt In any further communication on this subject, please quote no. t /&amp;c/ts/ j# 7 / 6 s' and address —not to any person by name.

It is Indeed clear that it would be greatly preferable from every point of view. Including that of the Arabs themselves, that no such Conference should be held, for the present at any rate, either in Jerusalem or in Bagdad* and it is most desirable that every opportunity should be taken, short of actively and officially attempting to prevent the Congress, to discourage the proposal, meanwhile, you will observe that in Paragraph 8 of the Colonial Hie iJxoelloncy Lieutenant-Colonel r.ir Francis Huaphrys, a.C,iUO., G.c,V,0., etc., etc., oto., Bagdad * »CoXonlnl office letter the view is expressed that# Xf the (Jon^reoe i© not held in Bagdad# the most prohahle altei'na live for the site of the Congress would he Jeme&amp;lemo In these circumstances it la Important that any eliorto which may ho made# or arguments which may ho used to discourage the holding of tha Congress# should not he directed merely against the choice of Bagdad as the proposed meeting place# hut should rather he aimed at preventing the proposed Congress from being held at alio 4o While I naturally leave the question of the methods to he employed and the arguments to ha advanced with a view to discouraging the idea of the Congress entirely to your discretion# it is possible that the following considerations might effectively he urged should a suitable opportunity offero In the first place it is clear that none of ^h© causes which King ^sisal may he presumed to have most nt heart - ©ogo the consolidation ©ad international standing of Iraq, the future of the Hcohlmlte family la general# and even the ultimate hope of a development of a greater measure of Arab unity - are lively to he furthered by the holding of an Arab or Moslem Congress# either ia Bagdad or in Jerusalem# at the present time* .Apart from the strong arguments advanced in paragraph 4 of Sir Arthur Vauchope's despatch of March lot to the Colonial Office «= that is that the proceedings of the Congress could hardly fail to produce an adverse reaction on the French# and therefore to prove eaiberrassing not only to ^ranoo-Britiah hut olao to Syriaa-Xroqi relatione - any conr-rc^B which mifftt he held would feo likely to afford an opportunity for raisingraising in an acutely eo&amp;t rove ratal fora such enibarrsaaing question© for the Tfaahialte family as that of the Amir Abdullah’s attitude towards Jewish aettlement in ’'’ransJordan in connexion with the recent proposal to lease his land to a Jewish group* and his attitude towards certain Arab parties in falestlne itself* Moreover If repreoentativss of 'jaudl Arabia attend it cannot be assumed* despite the marked improvement now effected in the relation© between r rone Jordon and ciaudi trabia, that no reference would be mace to the recent ineurrociiom;

It is most desirable that the Congress should not take place in Palestine. The effect may be bad wherever it may be held, but it is obvious that it will be woree and more far»reaehing in Palestine than in any other country. If it is held in Palestine, the majority of whose population ie easily animated by hostility to the Jewish national home, the bitterness of the relations between the Arab and the Jewish sections of the population will certainly be enhanced. 4. furthermore, the Congress ie almost certain to adept an attitude towards policy in Jyria, which enn only be Interpreted by the french as hostile, and which may therefore be embarrassing to french and British relations in the Middle fast.

O .THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT WITH reference to my despatch No. 1164 of the 21st December last, I have the honour to inform you that, during an audience which I had with King Feisal yesterday, he adverted again to the subject of the Arab congress. His Majesty informed me that an organising committee would soon be set up, and would publish a preliminary agenda for the work of the congress, which would probably meet early in April in Bagdad. Its aim would be to consider how the political / objectives of the Arabs could be achieved through closer cultural, social and/ economic union. 2. I repeated my previous warnings as to the danger of the deliberations of the congress increasing the difficulties in the way of the solution of the problem of Arab aspirations in Syria and Palestine, and emphasised that any violent criticism of either British or French policy in these two countries could do incalculable harm to Arab interests, besides seriously embarrassing the Iraqi Government and King Feisal himself. His Majesty said that he fully appreciated the force of my arguments, and, while he could not, of course, give any binding assurances as to what might be said at the congress, he was confident that those who would take part would discuss Arab problems in a calm and statesmanlike manner, and would seek by constructive proposals to facilitate the solution of the difficulties which confronted Great Britain and France in their relations with the Arabs. For his part, he w^as convinced that the realisation of the aspirations of the Arabs was dependent on the maintenance of close friendly relations with His Majesty’s Government, and he w r as full of hope that the congress would come to the same conclusion. 3. I then enquired what countries would be likely to send delegates to the congress. His Majesty said that he expected representatives of the Arabs in Syria, Palestine, Iraq and Transjordan to take part. It was unlikely that Egypt would be represented owing' to the split in the Wafd, but delegates from I Saudi Arabia might possibly participate. The organisers had sent a representa- I tive to Mecca to approach King Ibn Saud in the matter, and he had been informed j that there would be no objection to delegates from the Hejaz or Nejd attending, provided that nothing would be said at the congress to harm King Ibn Saud’s - interests. I closed the conversation with the remark that, in any event, I relied on His Majesty to take whatever action might be necessary to ensure that the congress would steer clear of the dangers to which I had drawn his attention. 4. lam sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s representatives at Cairo, Tehran, Jerusalem, Istanbul and Beirut.

My dear Lancelot, Since my despatch 1164 of the 21st December was written, I had another talk with King Peisal on the subject (of the Arab Congress to be held in Bagdad) on the 2nd January, and enclose a minute of the conversation. 1 do not think there is anything else I can usefully do in the matter. I have already indicated to the King the only conditions on which he should allow the Congress to beheld in Bagdad, which would rob it of its most objectionable possibilities, and there are so many jealousies and rivalries among the promoters themselves that it will be difficult for them to agree on a venue. Abbas Hilmi’s visit to Bagdad has so far thrown no further light on the situation. Yours ever, (Signed) P.H. Humphrys. Sir Lancelot Oliphant, K.C.M.G., C.B.f COPY. SECRET.

Humphrys » During my interview with the King on the 2nd January I had an opportunity again to warn His Majesty of the danger of the Arab Congress causing the 1 Iraqi Government embarrass ment with their neighbours. As on a previous occasion, he assured me that those who would come would be responsible men who would 'be careful to avoid inflammatory speeches. The ain of the Congress would he to endeavour to define an objective for which all Arabs could work and thereby to substitute a unity of ideas for the present chaos of conflicting aims and opinions which existed among them. He was sure that a visit to f Iraq would do much to improve the attitude of many Arab leaders towards His Majesty’s Government, as they would see the progress made and the liberty enjoyed by ’Iraq and would, he was confident, realise that co-operation with England was the only method whereby they could achieve the freedom and unity to which they aspired. As we have not yet received a reply to my despatch of the 21st December, I did not discuss the matter but repeated in general terms my warning of the serious consequences for ’Iraq if the Congress were to indulge in aousive polemics about the position of the Arabs in either Syria or Palestine.Notes.

I HAVE the honour to offer the following observations on your secret despatch No. 586 of the 3rd November, 1932, on the subject of King Feisal’s ambition to see established a confederation of Arab States under Hashimite influence. 2. The outline of King Feisal's aims and hopes described in your despatch as having been given by Nuri Pasha to a member of the staff of the Colonial Office reflects, I think, very truly the picture of the future which the King hears in his mind. 3. There can be no doubt that he still hopes and works for the close federation under the rule of his House of all the Arab territories in Asia, and it seems that his intention is to endeavour to bring about first the union of Syria and Iraq. Whether this is to be done by uniting them under his own rule or by placing another member of his family on the Syrian Throne, and then bringing the two countries into close alliance, I do not think he has yet decided, though certainly the first alternative would find greater favour with him. His objective is fixed, but the means whereby it is to be attained are likely to be adapted to the tendencies of current events. 4. He has never ceased to nurse his Syrian supporters carefully nor to maintain close touch with the Nationalist elements in Damascus. During the early months of 1932 sections of the Arabic press in both Syria and Iraq constantly published articles in which the accession of the Amir Abdullah, King Ali or King Feisal to the Syrian Throne was discussed, hut after the Syrian elections and the opening of the first Syrian Parliament this form of propaganda decreased. The King’s dream of ruling the Arab world (preferably from Damascus) was not, however, disturbed by these events or by the failure of the monarchist candidates in the Syrian elections, and he has continued patiently and cautiously to work for the ultimate realisation of his ambitions. 5. The Arab Congress idea, to which I have referred in my confidential despatch B of the 27th July to the Secretary of State for the Colonies and my ; secret despatch No. 1164 of the 21st December, 1932, to you, offered a new! opportunity for furthering his ends which he was not slow to seize. His plan is that the congress should bring about unity among the Arabs by substituting the pursuit of a clearly-defined common aim for the present chaos of conflicting views which divides them even among themselves. This aim is to be, I gather, first, the freeing of Syria from French mandatory control, which King Feisal regards as ^ being the only serious obstacle to the union of the two countries. As regards j Palestine, His Majesty has expressed to me his personal opinion that a country | so closely connected with the three principal religions of the world should enjoy j conciliatory treatment of an exceptional kind under the aegis of Great Britain. 6. His Majesty also professes to believe that by gathering together a number of representative Arab leaders in Bagdad he will be able, by demonstra tion, to convince them of the reality of the independence which Iraq has achieved and thereby to wean many of them, especially the Palestinians, from their present suspicion of British policy in regard to the Arabs. By the same means, I have no doubt, he hopes to whet the appetite of the Syrians, and by giving them a glimpse of their reward to encourage them to carry on the struggle with the Irench. 7. For the present, I judge that the Arab Congress scheme occupies his mind to the exclusion of more direct methods of gaining his ends, but I have no doubt that he is prepared at any moment to employ less circuitous means if a favourable opportunity should occur. It should not be overlooked that, while King Feisal’s brothers, King Ali and the Amir Abdullah, both share His2 Majesty’s aspirations for the future of the Arabs, they are exceedingly jealous of his success and distrustful and suspicious of his personal ambitions. lor this reason I anticipate that their intrigues, especially those of the Amir Abdullah, are likely to interfere very considerably in the smooth working of His Majesty s plans. 8. The reported intention of Abbas Hilmi to pay a visit to Bagdad after ^ Ramzan is a further complication, as the ex-Khedive has a long purse and is almost venerated for his skill in political intrigue. 9.

December 21, 1932. 1 HAVE the honour to communicate the following record of a conversation which I had with King Feisal on the morning of the 20th December : 2. His Majesty said that he wished to ask my opinion about the proposal that an Arab Congress should be held in Bagdad. This proposal was an outcome of the growing movement among the Arab intelligentsia towards a closer union among all Arab peoples. Although for the next decade the chief task of the Iraqi Government would be to develop the resources of the country and to raise the standard of education and living of the people, he felt that, taking a long view of Iraq’s future, the pan-Arab movement was not one which the Iraqi Government should ignore. On the north and east Iraq was overshadowed by powerful neighbours, whose growing nationalism might in the future constitute a danger to Iraq’s independence. In Persia dreams of the old Sassanian Empire were being revived, and in the schools children were taught to think of Ctesiphon as the rightful capital of the Persian King of Kings. Turkey, for the moment, was a safe neighbour, but no one could be sure that her old claims to the Mosul Vilayet might not be revived again later on. On the west, too, there would always be a threat to Iraq so long as the French remained in their piesent strong position in Syria. They, too, had once coveted Mosul and its oil. Could one be sure that they no longer dreamt of being masters of the Mosul oilfields? 3. It was true that, by virtue of her alliance with Great Britain. Iraq had nothing to fear from her neighbours at present, but he was looking ahead, and he thought that it would be unfair to Great Britain for Iraq to rely indefinitely on her 'for support. Bearing these considerations in mind. His Majesty felt that it was necessary for Iraq to seek some means of reinforcing her position, and to his mind the pan-Arab movement promised the best source of additional strength. If Iraq could rely on the support of all the other Arab peoples, if, more especially, she and the Arabs of Syria could stand firmly side by side, the dangers which threatened Iraq s future integrity would be greatly diminished. 4. While, therefore, he believed it to be in Iraqi interests to give discreet encouragement to the Arab Congress as a means of strengthening ideas of Arab unity, he had some misgivings as to the attitude of His Majesty’s Government towards both the pan-Arab movement and the Arab Congress. For this reason he wished to ask my private opinion, firstly, as to whether I thought that His Majesty’s Government still entertained the same sympathy towards the Arab cause that they had shown during the war, and, secondly, whether it was likely that His Majesty’s Government would regard with disfavour the holding of an Arab Congress in Bagdad. . 5. I said that His Majesty's remarks and the two questions with which thev had concluded raised very far-reaching considerations. I entirely agreed with him that Iraq should not rely indefinitely on British support for her safety, but I had some doubts as to whether the ideals of the movement for a clqsei union of Arab peoples really offered the best means of strengthening her position. Turkey, I feared, would view with misgivings any consolidation of the Arab peoples on her southern frontier; Persia, whose outlet to the sea in the south lay in an area predominantly inhabited by Arabs, would certainly be hostile to such a movement, while France, though now evidently prepared to follow in Syria the policy adopted by Great Britain in Iraq, was unlikely to relinquish her hold over the eastern littoral of the Mediterranean and would certainly be opposed to any movement aiming at the political unification of the Arabs and thereby threatening the Lebanon from the east. It seemed to me, therefore, at first viewy that a movement towards union with other Arab peoples, instead of strengthening Iraq’s position, might very easily provoke active hostility against her among her neighbours and accentuate the dangers wdiich His Majesty feared; dangers [655 ff—1]which were, I believed, far less real than he imagined. I did not myself share His Majesty s apprehensions that either Turkey or Persia had any designs in present circumstances on Iraqi territory, and the French clearly had their hands quite full enough already and had not, I was convinced, the least intention of endeavouring to add to these difficulties by encroaching on Iraq. At all events, all these considerations were largely speculative and neither His Majesty nor the Iraqi Government need gi’eatly concern themselves for the present with what was likely to happen in ten years' time. For the present their membership of the League and their alliance with Great Britain gave them a security enjoyed by few other countries in the world, and as he had himself remarked, the pressing- need of the moment was to set their own house in order. The best way Iraq could serve the Arab cause was, through her own economic and cultural progress, to win back for the Arabs the prestige which they had once enioyed among the nations of the world. 6. As regards the attitude of His Majesty’s Government towards the Arabs and towards the proposal for holding an Arab Congress in Bagdad, His Majesty had, I thought, seen in British policy in Iraq clear evidence of their continued sincere sympathy with the aspirations of the Arab nation to take their legitimate place among the free and enlightened nations of the world, and it was unnecessary for me to say anything more on that point. The idea of holding a congress was quite natural and such a manifestation of a sentiment, which was well known to exist, should not give rise to any difficulties if common sense, tact and restraint were exercised by those who took part. I warned His Majesty, however, that if it were held in Bagdad the Iraqi Government would necessarily become responsible if anything were said or done to give offence to their neighbours, whereas if it were held elsewhere, for example Mecca, the Iraqi Government would have no responsibility for what occurred. I could not give any official opinion of how such a congress would be regarded by His Majesty’s Government without first referring the matter to them, but speaking privately and without having had an opportunity to consider the proposal in detail, it seemed to me that if His Majesty wished to avoid embarrassment from the deliberations of the congress, the following conditions should be imposed on the organisers if it were held in Bagdad : — l he agenda of the congress should be restricted to cultural and economic questions and politics should be excluded from their discussions. The utmost care should be taken to avoid inciting the Arabs of Syria to resort to other than peaceful means for reaching agreement with the French; and to avoid stirring up the Arabs of Palestine against the Jews. Consideration should be paid to the susceptibilities of King Abdul Aziz-al- Saud. For example, His Majesty must not be given the impression that his position was being threatened by any member of the Hashimite family. 7. The King said that he agreed with my views, and while he could not give a positive assurance that someone might not m a speech commit an indiscretion, he felt that this was unlikely, as those who would take part were all responsible men of experience. It was the intention of the organisers to limit, as I had suggested, the discussions of the congress to cultural and economic questions, and he was confident that the resolutions adopted, and it was by these that the congress should be judged, would conform to the conditions which I had laid down. 8. I asked His Majesty when the congress was likely to take place. He replied that he thought that the preparations would probably be completed by- March. 9. I consider that King Feisal is unwise to encourage the holding of the congress in Bagdad, but it is only natural that the proposal should appeal very strongly to him, and in present circumstances I felt that it was outside my province to take up a definitely hostile attitude towards it. 10. If the King can so influence the proceedings of the congress that the stipulations which I have made are observed, little harm will, I think, be done, and I should accordingly be glad to know whether, in the event of His Majesty raising the question again, I may inform him that His Majesty’s Government support the views which I have already given to him privately. 11. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s representatives at Cairo. Tehran, Jerusalem, Istanbul, Jeddah and Beirut. I have, &amp;c. F. H. HUMPHRYS.My dear Francis, We duly received your despatch No.1164, secret, of the 21st December, reporting your long conversation with King Feisal about the proposal for an Arab Congress to be held in Bagdad. 2. We ourselves do not feel that the holding of such a Congress there can in the long run prove particularly sensible or useful from H.M. f s own point of view, and it will, we fear, certainly not be well received in other quarters. Of course we appreciate the fact that you could not have vetoed it. But we feel that you could certainly have gone further than you did in cold-watering it - with your accustomed charm. 3. We do not propose to send any official reply to your despatch, but I send these few lines in case King Feisal returns to the charge. (signed) Lancelot Oliphant.
