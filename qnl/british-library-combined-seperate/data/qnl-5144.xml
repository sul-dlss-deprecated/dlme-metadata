Several items of correspondence are written in Arabic.The file contains translations of letters and memoranda from the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in which requests are made for the Embassy's (and by extension, the Agency's) assistance in matters regarding former residents of Iraq (most of whom are also Iraqi citizens) who are thought to be living and working in Bahrain. Most of the requests are for legal documents (some of which are judicial summons) to be issued to Iraqi employees in Bahrain so that they may be signed, countersigned, and returned.The file also includes translated copies of letters, addressed to the British Consuls at Baghdad and Basra respectively, from Iraqi residents requesting assistance in the recovery of debts and maintenance payments from relatives and acquaintances who are now residing in Bahrain. In response to these requests the Political Agent advises that those seeking remittance should be instructed to file a regular suit in the Bahrain Agency Court, either in person or through an accredited agent.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Ministry of Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Embassy in Iraq, Baghdad</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Consul, Basra</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Consul, Baghdad</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Foreigners</topic></subject><subject><topic>Legal documents</topic></subject><subject><topic>Claims</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000272#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000272#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
