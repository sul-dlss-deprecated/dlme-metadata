The memorandum provides, in great detail, a British perspective on Turco-German relations between March and October 1918, regarding their respective interests in the recently dissolved Russian Empire in the Caucasus. It is divided into sections as follows:1. the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk;2. the negotiations at Trebizond [Trabzon];3. protests to Germany against Turkish atrocities;4. the negotiations at Batum [Batumi, Georgia];5. the Georgian mission to Berlin;6. the German press campaign against Turkish policy in the Caucasus;7. the Turkish treaties of Batum and German intervention in Georgia;8. the (abortive) conference at Constantinople [Istanbul];9. Turkish and German intrigues with the three nationalities (referred to in the memorandum as the Armenian Republic of Erivan [Yerevan], the Republic of Georgia, and the Tatar Republic of Azerbaijan);10. the frustration of Turkish policy by Germany.The memorandum opines that Turkey's [the Ottoman Empire's] aim of dominating Trans-Caucasia [Transcausasia] has been frustrated by German intervention; Germany's gains, according to the Foreign Office, are largely illusory, and come at the price of a feud with Turkey.An addendum to the memorandum quotes from a note from the Director of Military Intelligence [William Thwaites], dated 3 October 1918, which suggests that the Turks have latterly been gaining the upper hand in the Caucasus over the Germans.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office, Political Intelligence Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Director of Military Intelligence</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Trans-Caucasia</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Foreign affairs</topic></subject><subject><topic>Independence</topic></subject><subject><topic>Atrocities</topic></subject><subject><topic>Treaties</topic></subject><subject><topic>Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (1918)</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000184#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
