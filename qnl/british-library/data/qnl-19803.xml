The Residency Agent, Shargah, of whom enquiry was % made for confirmation of your news, reports that no change in the above arrangements has been contemplated, but the Shaikhs are annoyed at the confiscation or threatened con fiscation of their dhows at sea by Persian Preventive Service Launches and have been talking of retaliating by attaching boats owned by Persian subjects which arrive in their ports. The Residency Agent has warned the Chiefs against carrying out this policy and thinks that they will not do it. I have the honour to be.

For this reason I landed from the man-of-war and the Shaikh sent the three men who were the oause of toe mischief in company of some of the notables of Ras-ul-Khaiaah and were given each 21 canes in front of my house in the village HaralsUh* regard others who had assisted th£s mischief makers I forgave them and thiscaiejto an end^ I 'beg to inform you in regard to the refuge woman that some of the inhabitants of Ras-ul-Khaimah ftho are my friends have informed me that if she were handed o¥er to the Ruler of Ras-ul-Khairaah he will deliver her to her 'brother to kill her at once. This is a disgraceful act and undermines (»»e prestige in the atge of the Arahs. There is n® doubt that they will kill this woman if she is delivered to them, 'because four women had heen killed at Ras-ul-Khaimah sine the last two months as a result of the Shaikh's intrigues.

It is first necessary to discover who the woman is and her true reason for seeking protection at Isa's house. A slave woman might reasonably do so but it would be suspicious in the case of a free woman who by Arab custom would always go to her relatives. Isa's eldest son, who was born of a slave negress, has a bad reputation and it is quite possible that the whole trouble is due to improper conduct on his part with some woman in the village* Isa himself would gladly put political colour on the matter to obtain our support for his family but British support must not be given to crime against Arab laws and customs. 3. The Senior Naval Officer is satisfied that the Commanding Officer, H.M. S. 'CROCUS' took the greatest p ^ins to arrive at the truth of the matter but it is noteworthy that the Senior Naval Officer has since heard from two native sources that the woman was abducted from her home by Isa's eldest son and was found by her brother at the son's house (not Isa 1 s house). The Senior Naval Officer has also heard that there was some discontent in the village on account of the punishment of the men and that since then both of Isa*s sons have left the neighbourhood by order of the Sheikh. It is likely to be some time before the whole truth is discovered.

After some time a dispute arose betv/een the mother of the three boys and the wife of Abdul Rahman, and the mother there fore left Hamriyah and went to Shargah, 'but for some years the three 'boys remained in the house of AMur Rahman, '.Then they t uM b&lt;*44 c they asked Abdur Rahman for their fa.t/hcr's property and that he had died leaving Rs. 10,000/-, Ahdur Raliman did not give them any share of his brother's property and Saif and his brothers went pearling but apparently j.id not, make it paytftjand latterly had &gt;• ^ t ,, t rnn {&gt;ly beegi in very straightened circumstances, and had been renewing their claim rSiu 'i 1 1 r'd l 'P- a r r. t l -hu,v e ; for a share ;n their father's property. ^ Saif had divided his time between Shargah and Hamriyah, but at the time of the murder was actually residing in Hamri ^yah.

Subsequently he hsd and his brothers went to the Shaikh's house and murdered the younger son and wife of Abdur Rahman. Abdur Rahman's elder son, Hamed, has lived in Debai for the last 3 or 4 years, since he tried to turn his father out of Hamriyah, He appealed ffir support to the Shaikh of Cmma-al- Qiffain, who sent for the people of Hamriyah and asked them if they .vould accept Hamed as Shaikh, but t^ey refused to do ^o, whereupon the Shaikh of Umma-al-^awairi told Hamed that he could xa-t do nothing more for him. i*-- ^ '5/-The Residency« BuBhire v the 3th December, 1936 # B £ 0^o A S64-n. aeference asy CiroaI( r Sio«d65*J of t -day.
