Subject &lt; Publicity. As you are aware from what has been published in the Press, a Foreign Publicity Department under the control of the oreign Office has been set up. In this connection, with a view to strengthen ing our Publicity activities in the Persian Gulf, certain suggestions have been made by His Majesty's Government. My proposals, which are now under consideration, include the provision of two extra interpreters, one for JBushire and one for Bahrain, where the Political Agent's vernacular staff is at present particularly hard worked. I have suggested that the interpreter at Bahrai n, who will, have specially important duties to carry out, should receive Special -raae pay and allowances. 2. One of the principle duties of the Bahrain interpreter will be, in addition to listening-in to all broadcasts, to prepare for immediate distribution copies of suitable broadcasts and other material. For this purpose a duplicating machine will be purchased / when (Signature) s. 44. MFP—1613 S&amp;P—&lt;M-2017)—21 -4-37—15,000. (Designation)when funda are made available .

My dear Fowle, In connection with correspondence on the subject of British propaganda in the Middle,East, I forward for your information a copy of a letter, dated 15th August, from Professor Rushbrook Williams, regarding a series of talks on Arabic capitals which it is proposed to broadcast from the Palestine Broadcasting Service• We should be glad if you would consider whether il would be possible to supply the Press Officer at Jerusalem with some material on the Persian Gulf States on the lines suggested. You will notice that Illustrative photographs k would also be welcome in connection with the subsequent publication of the talks. It is suggested that the most convenient arrange ment will be for you to send any material to the Press Officer, Jerusalem, direct. His address is - Mr. Owen Tweedy, The Press Officer, The Chief Secretary^ Office, Jerusalem. Yours sincerely, Sd.R.T. Peel The Hon. Lt.Colonel Sir T.C.W.

It would add greatly to the attraction of the series if each talk could be written by someone who is living in, or at least knows well, the capital with which it is concerned. The talks would each be fifteen minutes long, that is about 1700-2000 words: and after delivery, the script would be published in English in the Jerusalem Radio* and in Arabic in the Palestinian press. For purposes of publication the Press Officer would also like to be supplied with photographs of scenes in the various cities and of their rulers. We should be most grateful if you could arrange with the Resident in the Persian Gulf to supply the Press Officer with scripts on the capitals within his area, and if possible with photographs to illustrate them. Would this present any difficulty ? Yours sincerely Sd. L.F. Rushbrook Williams R.T Peel, Esqi Confidential D.O. No. C/559-1.a/50 Dated the 19th September 1939 The suggestion hes been made that a series of informative and factual talks on the capitals of Arab countries should be broadcasted. We might as well put Bahrain into these if v*e can possibly manage it and I am perfectly prepared to try my hand at a draft for the purpose, /^s however the broadcasting people seam to expect a talk of about 1700*2000 words I should be most grateful if you could give me just a few short sentences on interesting details in regard to Manama as you yourself see them. 2. These talks will probably be published in part of the Arab press also and the suggestion has been made that photographs of imposing or interesting buildings or scenes should be sent also — and of the T iuler.

His Majesty’s Government would presumably prefer that English-speaking people overseas - whether Empire subjects or not - should rely on London for their war news? but it is vastly improbable that tne tendency to turn for news to Paris, Rome and even Berlin is confined to the British and American residents of Bahrain alone. To this tendency, which derives directly from the poverty of the B.B.C. broad cast, may be ascribed the growing belief in all classes here in Bahrain that Britain and prance will shortly find them selves assailed by a hostile combination consisting of Germany, Russia, Japan, Turkey and probably Italy. - ttnds.

A few incidents had, it is true, been described in the Nazi Press during 1937 but towards the end of that year Herr Hitler concluded a Minorities Declaration with Poland, signed on November 5, which laid down the principles for the treatment of minorities in the two countires. The Declaration agreed tnat no attempt should be made to assimilate the minorities by force; that they snould have the free use of their mother tongues and national customs; that their right to unite in economic or cultural associations was guaranteed; that they might maintain their own schools and cnurches; and that there snould be no discrimination against them in commerce or the professions. HerrHitler professed himself satisfied and promised tnat his Government would ensure that the Polish racial group should ’’live side by side in harmony and peace with the German nation'. During the following year he never at any time spoke of any real oppression or persecution of the Germans in Poland. It was therefore with surprising suddenness that the German newspaper and wireless turned their attention six months ago to the 'atrocities” which they were alleged were being committed by the Poles against their German minority, But the reason for the campaign w'as not hard to discover, for it coincided exactly with the formulation of Nazi territorial demands against Poland, and the attacks were, as the earlier campaign against the Czechs had shown, a well-tried method of intimidation. On March 15 Nazi /GermanyGermany destroyed tne independence of Czechoslovakia; on March 24 she absorbed Memel; and on March 27 just as Herr von Ribbentrop was making his demands in Warsaw the official German news agency annou iced that 'German women and children vere being beaten and il_L-treated in Poland'. Prom that time forward wnen Poland refused Germany’s demands under threat and entered into an alliance with Great Britain, the Nazi Press kept up a contin uous stream of atrocity stories about the German minority in Poland. The stories were either a distortion of the facts or simple lies. In one case a German named K&amp;rletan who was arrested for the murder of a policeman was said to have been beaten to death and his wife arrested and his child thrown out of a window* But foreign newspaper correspondents in Poland reported that Karletan was in prison in good health and a photograph was taken of his wife and child happily reading a copy of the 'Vblkische Beobachter' the chief German Nazi newspaper. On June 22 the two Germans reported by the German news agency to have been brutally murdered by Poles informed the Polish police that they had not even been molested. A great deal of the agitation by the Germans in Poland in August was plainly worked up from the Reich on the lines of the agitations in Czechoslovakia a year before and last March and the Polish Govern ment were foreced in some cases to take precautionary measures against movements aimed at the destruction of their authority. The Poles have rightly drawn attention to the other side of the picture. There are certainly as many Poles in Germany as there are Germans in Poland and probably more. Indeed impartial estimates suggest that there are not more than 1,000,000 Germans in Poland whereas the German census of 1910 showed that there were 1,500,000 Poles in what is now the Third Reich. This Polish minority in Germany has never enjoyed that 'harmonj and peace” promised by Herr Hitler to the Poles in Germany in November, 1937 for the simple reason that the all-embracing and all-absorbing /Nationaladvancement of the German people, whilst the unrestricted power of the German Government to interfere in every field of activity even in peacetime enables officials to exert direct and indirect pressure on the members of national minorities. This pressure has again and again been employed to reduce the economic and cultural life of the Polish minority to the rigid National-Socialist pattern. For example, in Nazi Germany there are no free professional associations. The associations to which doctors, lawyers and or in the exercise of their profession 11 . Nor were Poles permitted ^ to have any dealings in real estate. A law of 1937 applying to the eastern frontier of the Reich laid down that buying, selling, inheriting and leasing of land required the approval of the local Landrat, and this approval was invariably withheld from Poles. In the sphere of education there were severe obstacles to Poles becoming qualified teachers in Germany since no Pole could obtain a . place in a training college unless he declare-d his belief in the National-Socialist creed. Consequently there was an increasing ^ scarcity of teachers in Polish schools. Apart from these restrictions on the professional activity of the better educated Poles cases of German Nazi interference with engineers belong are all of them entirely political in character. To gain membership the individual citizen has to show that he is a fervid National-Socialist. And yet if he does not belong to such an association he cannot carry on his profession or business., at all. Consequently unless Poles in Germany accepted National-Socialism in all it.s aspects they were excluded from most professions and trades carrying any degree of social prestige. This fact was a clear abuse of the Mhrer's undertaking that u the members of a minority' should not 'solely on account of such membership suffer any obstruction or disadvantage in the choice Polish • • • • •Services Polish religious practices became more frequent» including funerals conducted in the Polish languages were broken up by German rowdies or even forbidden to take place - another definite violation of the Minorities Declarationo Prom the end of 1938 a number of Poles were compelled to leave their homes of the frontier for the interior of the Peictu The formulation of the far-reaching German demands on the Polish Government and the opening of the violent German press campaign against Poland in the spring of this year coincided with a relaxation of such police protection of the Polish minorities as had previously existed. Throughout German Silesia and ^ast Prussia Poles were molested and their property damaged. Stones were thrown at Polish schools, institutions and private houses, and many windows were deliberately smashed. Polish schoolteachers were mishandled in the streets and in caf 6 s. Threats of dismissal were made against Polish workmen, and the use of the Polish language frequently gave rise to incidents. Beyond this there was a whole series of irritating administrative discriminations. Some Polish schools were closed, passports were taken from business men and men working across the frontier, and Polish meetings prohibited. At this time too attacks on Polish religious practices became more common. German mobs prevented Poles from going into churches; Polish Roman Catholic ''h papers were seized; pilgrimages to Czestochowa, the ’’Polish Lourdes” were prohibited; and Polish inscriptions on crosses were defaced. On May 17th, the Gernmn Government began to carry out a census with the object of proving that there were .fewer Poles in Germany than the Polish Government maintained. Lvery kind of administrative pressure or trickery was employed to induce the Poles to opt in favour of German nationality. Poles were not allowed to fill in forms themselves, this being done by the officials often in a sense contrary to the wishes of the inhabitants.

Other Poles were sent to concentration camps without any reason being given and an increasing number of inoffensive Polish families, who were not even active in the minority cultural organizations, were shifted from the frontier to the interior of the Reich.. To sum up, the position of the Poles in Germany was difficult before the German-Polish Minority Declaration and became steadily worse after the German territorial demands were made against Poland last March. In face of growing pressure from the Gestapo (the Secret Police) both upon Polish individuals and organizations few Poles dared to express their resentment. Polish newspapers in Germany were forbidden to publish anything about the minority's grievances and those which did were confiscated. Poles in the German frontier districts were equally afraid to furnish details to the foreign Press. Nevertheless detailed accounts of National Socialist discrimination against the Polish minority have become available and only fear of retaliation upon individuals prevents the. full publication of the names the persons and places concernedTelegram En clair From To Dated Received Ministry of Information, London Political Resident. 3rd; 4th October 1939.

KING GEORGE VL to his Peoples (Broadcast on 3 rd September, 1939 ) In this grave hour, perhaps the most fateful in our history, I send to every household of my people, both at home and overseas, this message, spoken with the same depth of feeling for each one of you as if I were able to cross your threshold and speak to you myself. For the second time in the lives of most of us we are at war. Over and over again we have tried to find a peaceful way out of the differences between ourselves and those who are now our enemies. But it has been in vain. We have been forced into a conflict. For we are called with our Allies to meet the challenge of a principle which, if it were to prevail, would be fatal to any civilised order in the world. It is the principle which permits a State, in the selfish pursuit of power, to disregard its treaties and its solemn pledges; which sanctions the use of force or threat of force against the sovereignty and independence of other States. Such a principle, stripped of all disguise, is surely the mere primitive doctrine that might is right; and if this principle were established throughout the world the freedom of our own country and of the whole British Commonwealth of Nations would be in danger. But far more than this—the peoples of the world would be kept in the bondage of fear and all hopes of settled peace and of the security of justice and liberty among nations would be ended. This is the ultimate issue which confronts us. For the sake of all that we ourselves hold dear and of the world’s order and peace, it is unthinkable that we should refuse to meet the challenge. It is to this high purpose that I now call my people at home and my peoples across the seas who will make our cause their own. I ask them to stand calm and firm and united in this time of trial. The task will be hard. There may be dark days ahead and war can no longer be confined to the battlefield. But we can only do the right as we see the right and reverently commit our cause to God. If one and all we keep resolutely faithful to it, ready for whatever service or sacrifice it may demand, then, with God’s help, we shall prevail. May He bless and keep us all.I. Is/ September, 1939. Proclamation by President Moscicki to the Polish Nation Early this morning Germany launched an attack on the Polish State. In this historic moment I appeal to all our citizens with the deep conviction that the whole nation will, in defence of its freedom, independence and honour, rally round the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces and give a proper reply to the German aggressor, as it has so often done in the past. The whole nation, conscious that the blessing of the Almighty rests on its fight for a sacred and just cause, and united in the Army, will take up the struggle until victory is complete. IF. 1st September, 1939. Statement by the Rt. Hon. Neville Chamberlain, M P., Prime Minister, in the House of Commons I do not propose to say many words to-night. The time has come when action rather than speech is required. Eighteen months ago in this House I prayed that the responsibility might not fall upon me to ask this country to accept the awful arbitrament of war. I fear that I may not be able to avoid that responsibility. But, at any rate, I cannot wish for conditions in which such a burden should fall upon me in which I should feel clearer than I do to-day as to where my duty lies. No man can say that the Government could have done more to try to keep open the way for an honourable and equitable settlement of the dispute between Germany and Poland. Nor have we neglected any means of making it crystal clear to the German Government that if they insisted on using force again in the manner in which they had used it in the past we were resolved to oppose them by force. Now that all the relevant documents are being made public we shall stand at the bar of history knowing that the responsibility for this terrible catastrophe lies on the shoulders of one man — the German Chan cellor, who has not hesitated to plunge the world into misery in order to serve his own senseless ambitions. I have now had all the correspondence with the German Govern ment put into the form of a White Paper.* I do not think it is necessary for me to refer in detail now to these documents, which are already past history. They make it perfectly clear that our object has been to try and bring about discussions of the Polish- * Cmd. 6102. For summary, with extracts, see pp 9-14. 5 a 2German dispute between the two countries themselves on terms of equality, the settlement to be one which safeguarded the indepen dence of Poland and of which the due observance would be secured by international guarantees. There is just one passage from a recent communication, which was dated 30th August, which I should like to quote, because it shows how easily the final clash might have been avoided had there been the least desire on the part of the German Government to arrive at a peaceful settlement. In this document we said: “ His Majesty’s Government fully recognise the need for speed in the initiation of discussions, and they share the apprehensions of the Chancellor arising from the proximity of two mobilised armies standing face to face. They would accordingly most strongly urge that both parties should undertake that, during the negotiations, no aggressive military movements will take place. His Majesty’s Government feel confident that they could obtain such an undertaking from the Polish Govermnent if the German Government would give similar assurances.” That message, which was repeated to Poland, brought an instan taneous reply from the Polish Government, dated 3bY August, in which they said: “ The Polish Government are also prepared on a reciprocal basis to give a formal guarantee in the event of negotiations taking place that Polish troops will not violate the frontiers of the German Reich, provided a corresponding guarantee is given regarding the non-violation of the frontiers of Poland by troops of the German Reich.” We never had any reply from the German Government to that suggestion, one which, if it had been followed, might have saved the catastrophe which took place this morning. In the German broadcast last night, which recited the 16 points of the proposals which they have put forward, there occurred this sentence: “ In these circumstances the Reich Government considers its proposals rejected.” I must examine that statement. I must tell the House what are the ^ circumstances. To begin with let me say that the text of these proposals has never been communicated by Germany to Poland at all. The history of the matter is this. On Tuesday, 29th August, in replying to a Note which we had sent to them, the German Government said, among other things, that they would imme diately draw up proposals for a solution acceptable to themselves and “ will, if possible, place these at the disposal of the British Government before the arrival of the Polish negotiator.” It will be seen by examination of the White Paper that the German Government had stated that they counted upon the arrival of a 67 plenipotentiary from Poland in Berlin on the 30th, that is to say, on the following day. In the meantime, of course, we were awaiting these proposals. The next evening, when ourAmbassador saw Herr von Ribbentrop, the German Foreign Secretary, he urged upon the latter that when these proposals were ready—for we had heard no more about them—he should invite the Polish Ambassador to call and should hand him the proposals for trans mission to his Government. Thereupon, reports our Ambassador, in the most violent terms Herr von Ribbentrop said he would never ask the Ambassador to visit him. He hinted that if the Polish Ambassador asked him for an interview it might be different. The House will see that this was on Wednesday night, which, according to the German statement of last night, is now claimed to be the final date after which no negotiation with Poland was acceptable. It is plain, therefore, that Germany claims to treat Poland as in the wrong because she had not by Wednesday night entered upon discussions with Germany about a set of proposals of which she had never heard. Now what of ourselves ? On that Wednesday night, at the inter view to which I have just referred, Herr von Ribbentrop produced a lengthy document which he read out in German, aloud, at top speed. Naturally, after this reading our Ambassador asked for a copy of the document, but the reply was that it was now too late, as the Polish representative had not arrived in Berlin by midnight. And so, we never got a copy of those proposals, and the first time we heard them —we heard them—was in the broadcast last night. Well, those are the circumstances in which the German Government said that they would consider that their proposals were rejected. Is it not clear that their conception of a negotiation was that on almost instantaneous demand a Polish plenipotentiary should go to Berlin—where others had been before him—and should there receive a statement of demands to be accepted in their entirety or refused? I am not pronouncing any opinion upon the terms themselves, tor I do not feel called upon to do so. The proper course, in our view—in the view of all of us—was that these proposals should have been put before the Poles, who should have been given time to consider them and to say whether, in their opinion, they did or did not infringe those vital interests of Poland which Germany had assured us on a previous occasion she intended to respect. Only last night the Polish Ambassador did see the German Foreign Secretary, Herr von Ribbentrop. Once again he expressed to him what, indeed, the Polish Government had already said publicly, that they were willing to negotiate with Germany about their disputes on an equal basis. What was the reply of the German Government ? The reply urn that without another word the German troops crossed the Polish frontier this morning at dawn and are since reported to be bombing open towns. In these circumstances there is only one course open to us. His Majesty’s Ambassador in8 Berlin and the French Ambassador have been instructed to hand to the German Government the following document: “ Early this morning the German Chancellor issued a pro clamation to the German Army which indicated clearly that he was about to attack Poland. Information which has reached His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the French Government indicates that German troops have crossed the Polish frontier and that attacks upon Polish towns are proceeding. In these circumstances it appears to the Governments of the United Kingdom and of France that by their action the German Government have created conditions, namely, an aggressive act of force against Poland threatening the independence of Poland, which call for the implementation by the Governments of the United Kingdom and of France of the undertaking to Poland to come to her assistance. I am accordingly to inform your Excellency that unless the German Government are prepared to give His Majesty’s Government satisfactory assurances that the German Government have suspended all aggressive action against Poland and are prepared promptly to withdraw then- forces from Polish territory, His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom will without hesitation fulfil their obligations to Poland.” If a reply to this last warning is unfavourable, and I do not suggest that it is likely to be otherwise, His Majesty’s Ambas sador is instructed to ask for his passports. In that case we are ready . . . There is one other allusion which I should like to make before I end my speech, and that is to record my satisfaction, and the satisfaction of His Majesty’s Government, that throughout these last days of crisis Signor Mussolini also has been doing his best to reach a solution. It now only remains for us to set our teeth and to enter upon this struggle, which we ourselves earnestly endeavoured to avoid, with determination to see it through to the end. We shall enter it with a clear conscience, with the support of the Dominions and the British Empire, and the moral approval of the greater part of the world. We have no quarrel with the German people, except that they allow themselves to be governed by a Nazi Government. As long as that Government exists and pursues the methods it has so persistently followed during the last two years, there will be no peace in Europe. We shall merely pass from one crisis to an other, and see one country after another attacked by methods which have now become familiar to us in their sickening technique. We are resolved that these methods must come to an end. If out of the struggle we again re-establish in the world the rules of good faith and the renunciation of force, why, then even the sacrifices that will be entailed upon us will find their fullest justification.22nd August — 2&gt;rd September, 1939. Summary (with Quotations) of the Correspondence between the United Kingdom and Germany.* The correspondence between the British and German Govern ments “ makes it perfectly clear,” in the Prime Minister’s words, “ that our object has been to try and bring about discussions of the Polish- German dispute between the two countries themselves on terms of equality, the settlement to be one which safeguarded the independence of Poland and of which the due observance would be by international guarantees.” The correspondence opened with a letter from the Prime Minister to Herr Hitler dated 22nd August, in which after referring to certain precautionary measures taken by the British Government he pointed out that they in turn had been made necessary by military movements in Germany. He emphasised that British obligations to Poland were in no way affected by the signature of the German-Soviet Agreement. “ It has been alleged ” (he continued) “ that, if His Majesty’s Government had made their position more clear in 1914, the great catastrophe would have been avoided. Whether or not there is any force in that allegation. His Majesty’s Government are resolved that on this occasion there shall be no such tragic misunderstanding.” After repeating his conviction that war between Great Britain and Germany would be the greatest calamity that could occur, he added: “ I cannot see that there is anything in the questions arising between Germany and Poland which could not and should not be resolved without the use of force, if only a situation of confidence could be restored to enable discussions to be carried on in an atmosphere different from that which prevails to-day. We have been, and at all times will be, ready to assist in creating conditions in which such negotiations could take place, and in which it might be possible con currently to discuss the wider problems affecting the future of international relations, including matters of interest to us and to you. The difficulties in the way of any peaceful discussion in the present state of tension are, however, obvious, and the longer that tension is maintained, the harder will it be for reason to prevail. These difficulties, however, might be mitigated, if not removed, provided that there could for an initial period be a truce on both sides—and indeed on all sides — to press polemics and to all incitement. If such a truce could be arranged, then, at the end of that period, during which steps could be taken to examine and deal with complaints made by either side as to the treatment of minorities, it is reasonable to hope that suitable con ditions might have been established for direct negotiations between Germany and Poland upon the issues between them (with the aid of a neutral intermediary, if both sides should think that that would be helpful). But I am bound to say that there would be slender hope of bringing such negotiations to successful issue unless it were understood beforehand that any settlement reached would, when concluded, be guaranteed by other Powers. His Majesty’s Government would be ready, if desired, to make such contribution as they could to the effective operation of such guarantees. At this moment I confess I can see no other way to avoid a catastrophe that will involve Europe in war.” Herr Hitler replied on 23rd August in a communication which, while ignoring the suggestion of a truce, made the following eight points: 1. Germany had never sought conflict with England and had tried for years to win English friendship. * British White Paper, Cmd. 6102. 910 2. The German Reich could not renounce certain definite interests including questions of a “ national-political and a psychological character.” Among these were Danzig and the Corridor, which lay in the German sphere of interest. 3. Germany was prepared to settle the questions of Danzig and of the Corridor on the basis of a proposal of “ truly unparalleled magnanimity,” but British allegations against Germany had dispelled the Polish inclination to negotiate. 4. The unconditional assurance given by England to Poland, he said, would encourage her to unloosen a wave of “ appal ling terrorism ” against the German inhabitants of Poland. He accused Poland of violating her legal obligations to Danzig and strangling the Free City economically. 5. The German Government had caused the Polish Govern- 0$ ment to be informed that they “ will not tolerate ” this state of affairs. He added that “ apart from this, the questions of the Corridor and of Danzig must and shall be solved.” 6. Herr Hitler took note of the British Government’s obliga tions to Poland. 7. He stated that he had received information that the British and French Governments intended to mobilise against Germany and announced that he would mobilise in response. 8. He repeated that all his life he had fought for Anglo- German friendship, but that this was not possible so long as the revision of the Versailles Diktat was opposed. On 25th August, Herr Hitler saw the British Ambassador in Berlin and after saying that it was ridiculous to think that Germany intended to conquer the world, added that Poland’s actual provocations had become intolerable; that Germany w'as in all circumstances determined to abolish these Macedonian conditions on her eastern frontier and that “ the problem of Danzig and the Corridor must be solved,” but that he was prepared after wards to make England “ a large and comprehensive offer ” so far as her own interests were concerned and was willing to negotiate on his colonial demands by peaceful methods. He 0* added that he did not expect England to give up her obligations to France and held out ultimate prospects of armament limitation. The British Government in their reply of 28th August, returned to the immediate issue, the question of direct negotiations between Germany and Poland, which was not even mentioned by Herr Hitler in his communication to the British Ambassador in Berlin. After noting Herr Hitler’s desire for friendship with the British Empire, the reply observed that the German Chancellor’s message dealt with two groups of questions: the matters in dispute between Germany and Poland and those affecting the ultimate relations between Germany and Great Britain.11 The British Government, the reply said, would be willing to dis cuss the proposals in so far as they concerned themselves after the differences between Germany and Poland had been peacefully composed. Everything, the reply went on, turned upon the nature of the settlement and the method by which it is to be reached. On these points, the importance ot which cannot be absent from the Chancellor’s mind, his message is silent, and His Majesty’s Government feel compelled to point out that an understanding upon both of these is essential to achieving further progress. , German Government will be aware that His Majesty’s Government have obligations to Poland by which they are bound and which they intend to honour. ^ cou , nc !*’ ^ or an y advantage offered to Great Britain, acquiesce in a settlement which put in jeopardy the independence of a State to whom they have given their guarantee. In the opinion of His Majesty's Government a reasonable solution of the differences between Germany and Poland could and should be effected by agreement between the two countries on tines which would include the safeguarding of Poland's essential interests . . . But . . . His Majesty’s Government consider it essential for the success of the discussions which would precede the agreement that it should be understood before hand that any settlement arrived at would be guaranteed by other Powers. His Majesty’s Government would be ready if desired to make their contribution to the effective operation of such a guarantee. In the view of His Majesty’s Government it follows that the next step should be the initiation of direct discussions between the German and Polish Governments on a basis which would include the principles stated above, namely, the safeguarding of Poland’s essential interests and the securing of the settlement by an international guarantee. They have already received a definite assurance from the Polish Government that they are prepared to enter into discussions on this basis, and His Majesty’s Govern ment hope the German Government would for their part also be willing to agree to this course. If, as His Majesty’s Government hope, such discussion led to agreement the way would be open to the negotiation of that wider and more complete understanding between Great Britain and Germany which both countries desire.” The British Government, in conclusion, agreed that it was necessary to reduce the state of tension caused by frontier inci dents, and went on to say that Herr Hitler should not think that the British Government, because of their obligations to Poland, were not anxious to use their influence to achieve a solution agreeable to both sides in the dispute. After mentioning the desirability of finding a peaceful and not warlike solution to Polish-German problems, they ended by saying that a just settle ment might open the way to world peace, whereas failure to reach it would mean a world war. In his reply to the British Government, handed to the British Ambassador in Berlin on 29th August, Herr Hitler demanded that a Polish negotiator should come to Berlin within twenty-four hours and stated that the German Government would draw up proposals for a solution “ acceptable to themselves.” After again referring to the need for improving the relations between Germany and England, Herr Hitler harked back to the proposals submitted by the German Government to the Polish Government in March [demanding the unconditional return of Danzig and an extra-territorial road across the Corridor] and alleged that since the middle of July, Poland had been in a state of mobilisation, had sent threatening demands to Danzig, and12 was trying to bring about “ the political exhaustion and economic destruction of this German community.” r ^ , The German Chancellor then repeated the accusations of Polish maltreatment of the German minority and his own demands for the full return both of Danzig and the Corridor to Germany. He continued as to the question of negotiations: “ 0 ^ this subject the Germiin Government makes the following declaration . Though sceptical as to the prospects of a successtul outcome, they are neverthe less prepared to accept the English proposal and to enter into direct discussions. They do so as has already been emphasised, solely as the result of the impression made upon them by the written statement received from the British Government that they too desire a pact of friendship in accordance with the general lines indicated to the The German Government desire in this way to give the British Government and the British nation a proof of the sincerity of Germany’s intentions to enter into a lasting friendship with Great Britain. * „ u The Government of the Reich felt, however, bound to point out to the British Government that in the event of a territorial re-arrangement in Poland they would no longer be able to bind themselves to give guarantees or to participate in guarantees without the U.S.S.R. being associated therewith. For the rest in making these proposals, the German Government have never had anv intention of touching Poland’s vital interests or questioning the existence of an independent Polish State. The German Government, accordingly, in these circum stances agree to accept the British Government’s offer of their good offices in securing the despatch to Berlin of a Polish Emissary with full powers. They count on the arrival of this Emissary on Wednesday, the 30th August, 1939. The German Government will immediately draw up proposals for a solution acceptable to themselves and will, if possible, place these at the disposal of the British r.nvfM-nmpnt before the arrival of the Polish negotiator.” At 2 a.m. on the morning of the following day, 30th August, the British Government telegraphed to their Ambassador in Berlin, saying: “ We shall give careful consideration to German Government’s reply, but it is, of course, unreasonable to expect that we can produce a Polish representative in Berlin to-day. and German Government must not expect this.” On the afternoon of 30th August, the Prime Minister sent a message to Herr Hitler saying that the German note was being urgently considered, that representations had been made in Warsaw urging the avoidance of frontier incidents, and that they welcomed the desire for Anglo-German understanding. Later in the afternoon two telegrams were sent to the British Ambassador in Berlin. The first emphasised the need to avoid incidents both on the German and Polish sides. The second said : *• We understand that German Government are insisting that a Polish representa- -p, tive with full powers must come to Berlin to receive German proposals. We cannot * advise Polish Government to comply with this procedure, which is wholly unreason able. Could you not suggest to German Government that they adopt the normal pro cedure, when their proposals are ready, of inviting Polish Ambassador to call and handing proposals to him for transmission to Warsaw and inviting suggestions as to conduct of negotiations. German Government have been good enough to promise they will communicate proposals also to His Majesty’s Government. If latter think they offer reasonable basis they can be counted on to do their best in Warsaw to facilitate negotiations.” At midnight on 30th August, the British Government’s promised reply was handed over to the German Government. In this reply, the British Government, after repeating their desire for a friendly understanding with Germany, took note that13 “ the German Government accept the British proposal and are prepared to enter into direct discussions with the Polish Government.' “ His Majesty’s Government ” (the reply continued) “ understand that the German Government accept in principle the condition that any settlement should be made the subject of an international guarantee. The question of who shall participate in this guarantee will have to be discussed further, and His Majesty’s Government hope that to avoid loss of time the German Government will take immediate steps to obtain the assent of the U.S.S.R., whose participation in the guarantee His Majesty’s Government have always assumed. His Majesty’s Government also note that the German Government accepts the position of the British Government as to Poland’s vital interests and independence. His Majesty’s Government must make an express reservation in regard to the statement of the particular demands put forward by the German Government in an earlier passage in their reply. They understand that the German Government are drawing up proposals for a solution. No doubt these proposals will be fully examined during the discussions. It can then be determined how far they are compatible with the essential conditions which His Majesty’s Government have stated and which in principle the German Government have expressed their willingness to accept. His Majesty’s Government are at once informing the Polish Government of the German Government’s reply. The method of contact and arrangements for dis cussions must obviously be agreed with all urgency between the German and Polish Governments, but in His Majesty’s Government’s view it would be im practicable to establish contact so early as to-day. His Majesty's Government fully recognise the need for speed in the initiation of discussion, and they share the apprehensions of the Chancellor arising from the proximity of two mobilised armies standing face to face. They would accordingly most strongly urge that both parties should undertake that, during the negotiations, no aggressive military’ movements will take place. His Majesty’s Government feel confident that they could obtain such an undertaking from the Polish Government if the German Government would give similar assurances. Further, His Majesty’s Government would suggest that a temporary modus vivendi might be arranged for Danzig, which might prevent the occurrence of incidents tending to render German-Polish relations more difficult.” On the evening of 31st August, Herr von Ribbentrop, the German Foreign Minister, gave a message to the British Ambassador in Berlin, in the course of which he announced that the German Government had waited for two days in vain for the arrival of a Polish negotiator with plenary powers in Berlin, and that “ in these circumstances the German Government regarded their proposals as having this time too been to all intents and purposes rejected.” [Yet, as the White Paper puts it, the British Govern ment consulted the Polish Government on its last reply to Herr Hitler, and “the Polish Government authorised His Majesty’s Government to inform the German Government that Poland was ready at once to enter into direct discussions with Germany.”] Herr von Ribbentrop then went on to produce “ a long document which he read out rapidly in German. _ It was apparently the sixteen-point plan which the German Government have since published. ^When Sir N. Henderson asked for the text of these proposals in accordance with the undertaking in the German replv of 29th August Herr von Ribbentrop asserted that it was now too late as the Polish plenipotentiary had not arrived in Berlin by midnight, as had been demanded by the German Government in their communica tion of the previous evening. The Polish Government on learning of these developments informed His Majesty’s Government during the afternoon of 31st August that they would authorise their Ambassador to inform the German Government that Poland had accepted the British proposals for negotiations.14 The Polish Ambiissudor in Berlin (M. Lipski) was not received by Herr von Ribbentrop until the evening of 31st August. After this interview the German Government broadcast their proposals forthwith. M. Lipski at once tried to establish contact with Warsaw but was unable to do so because all means of com munication between Poland and Germany had been closed by the German Government.” The British Government made one last effort at 11 p.m. on 31st August, when they sent a telegram to their Ambassador in Berlin, informing him that the Polish Government were taking steps to establish contact with the German Government through the Polish Ambassador, instructing him to ask the German Government “ whether they agree to the necessity for securing an immediate provisional modus vivendi as regards Danzig,” and suggesting Dr. Burckhardt, the Swiss who had acted as League High Commissioner in Danzig, as an intermediary. Sir N. Henderson sent a written communication to Herr von Ribbentrop accordingly. But at 5.30 a.m. on the morning of 1st September, Poland was invaded by the German forces.* On the evening of the same day the British Ambassador in Berlin informed the German Government that if assurances were not given that their forces would be promptly withdrawn from Poland the British Government would “without hesitation fulfil their obligations to Poland.” (For text, see the Prime Minister’s speech of 1st September, on page 8.) No time-limit was mentioned. At 9 a.m. on 3rd September, the British Ambassador handed over a further note which referred to the previous communication and continued: “Although this communication was made more than twenty-four hours ago, no reply has been received, but German attacks upon Poland have been continued and intensified. I have accordingly the honour to inform you that unless not later than 11 a.m. British Summer Time to-day, 3rd September, satisfactory assurances to the above effect have been given by the German Government and have reached His Majesty s Government in London, a state of war will exist between the two countries as from that hour.” No such assurances having been received within the period stated, the German Charge d’Affaires in London was formally notified that a state of war between the two countries existed as from 11 a.m., 3rd September. IV. Ijf September y 1939. Manifesto issued by the National Executive of the British Labour Party. The Nazi Government has chosen war. Deaf to the appeals of all neutral Powers for peace by negotiation, openly insistent on the partition of a State with which it had a pact of non-aggression and against which, but a few months ago, it was insistins that it ine remaining paragraphs of this summary refer to documents which became available after the preparation of the British White Paper Cmd 6102 The texts oo llf and 3S&amp;ptera U b'rW3 “ H ° USe ° f Commons ^ ,he P™* Minister15 had no claims, disregarding the offer of the British and French Governments to discuss all issues in a peaceful way, it has wantonly and with set determination subjected the peoples of Europe to the final tragedy of conflict. The British Labour Movement has always declared that there are no international disputes incapable of settlement by peaceful negotiation. That is why it has always stood by the League of Nations. That is why it has always supported collective security. The British Labour Movement continues to affirm these principles. Equally, however, it has always insisted that aggression on the / part of any Power must be resisted. It has declared that the use of force in international disputes must be made forever impossible. The decision of the British Government to resist this latest effort of conquest by aggression on the part of Hitler therefore receives the full support of the Labour Movement in this country. It has for long criticised the policy of the National Government. It stands by that criticism. Had it been followed it believes that a very different world would now be in being. But, as it stood by Czecho-Slovakia on this principle, so British Labour stands also by Poland. British Labour has no quarrel with the German people. It does not seek to deprive them of any just rights to be obtained by rational and equal negotiation. It will, now that the die is cast, use all its influence and authority to secure a peace the basis of which is in accord with the faith it holds. It will resist any attempt to use the present conflict for ends that sow the seeds of further war. So long as its principles animate those whom Herr Hitler has driven to resistance against his aggression, so long they can count on the support of British Labour. None knows better than the Labour movement the tragic folly of war; but a stage has been reached in the development of Europe where war has been chosen by Herr Hitler as a deliberate instrument of national policy. It is impossible for Labour to acquiesce in claims supported, or conquests achieved, by this method. To do so would be an indefensible betrayal of its own vital faith. The British Labour movement therefore calls upon all its members to stand solidly behind it in resistance to aggression. Until those who have been willing to resort to its use have been overthrown, it sees no prospect of an enduring peace. The movement must summon all its energy and devotion to the task of defeating the aggressor. British Labour has taken this stand with calmness and without passion. It will hold itself free to define in its own way the con ditions of a just settlement at a later stage. It will use all its authority to build a peace of justice which removes the causes out of which war conies. With the defeat of the aggressors there emerges the prospect of building a better world from which the roots of economic and16 political grievances have been removed. The British Labour movement will give all its strength to making the foundations of that world a secure defence of peace and justice. V. 3rd September, 1939. Broadcast by the Rt. Hon. Neville Chamberlain, M.P., Prime Minister. I am speaking to you from the Cabinet Room at 10, Downing Street. This morning the British Ambassador in Berlin handed the German Government a final Note stating that unless we heard from them by 11 o’clock that they were prepared at once /~v to withdraw their troops from Poland a state of war would exist between us. I have to tell you now that no such undertaking has been received, and that consequently this country is at war with Germany. You can imagine what a bitter blow it is to me that all my long struggle to win peace has failed. Yet I cannot believe that there is anything more or anything different that I could have done and that would have been more successful. Up to the very last it would have been quite possible to have arranged a peaceful and honourable settlement between Germany and Poland. But Hitler would not have it. He had evidently made up his mind to attack Poland whatever happened; and although he now says he put forward reasonable proposals which were rejected by the Poles, that is not a true statement. The proposals were never shown to the Poles nor to us; and though they were announced in the German broadcast on Thursday night, Hitler did not wait to hear comments on them, but ordered his troops to cross the Polish frontier next morning. His action shows convincingly that there is no chance of expecting that this man will ever give up his practice of using force to gain his will. He can only be stopped by force and we and France are to-day, in fulfilment of our obligations, going to the aid of Poland, 0^ who is so bravely resisting this wicked and unprovoked attack upon her people. We have a clear conscience. We have done all that any country could do to establish peace, but a situation in which no word given by Germany’s ruler could be trusted and no people or country could feel themselves safe had become intolerable. And now that we have resolved to finish it, I know that you will all play your part with calmness and courage. At such a moment as this the assurances of support that we have received from the Empire are a source of profound encourage ment to us.When I have finished speaking certain detailed announcements will be made on behalf of the Government. Give them your close attention. The Government have made plans under which it will be possible to carry on the work of the nation in the days of stress and strain that may be ahead. But these plans need your help. You may be taking part in the Fighting Services or as a Volunteer in one of the branches of Civil Defence. If so, you will report for duty in accordance with the instructions you receive. You may be engaged in work essential to the prosecution of war or to the maintenance of life of the people—in factories, in trans port, in public utility concerns or in the supply of other necessaries of life. If so, it is of vital importance that you should carry on with your jobs. Now may God bless you all and may He defend the right. For it is evil things that we shall be fighting against, brute force, bad faith, injustice, oppression and persecution. And against them 1 am certain that the right will prevail. VI. 3rd September, 1939. Broadcast by the Rt. Hon. Arthur Greenwood, M.P., Acting-Leader of the Labour Party. Since 11 o’clock this morning we have been at war with Hitler. He has committed another crime of aggression. Austria, Czecho-Slovakia and Memelland have already been swallowed. At five o’clock last Friday morning, after having prepared the ground beforehand, he attacked Poland, which we had declared we would defend if she were the next victim of aggression. Until 11 o’clock this morning Poland stood alone, a brave and gallant people facing great odds, but determined to keep their liberty, and, by doing so, to protect ours. All honour to the grit and determination of the Polish people ! Now we are with them in the great struggle, heart, body and soul. We are at war because the British people are united and steadfast in their conviction that there are cherished possessions of mankind which are worth defending, for without them life is empty. We believe in Liberty, through which alone the mind and soul of the peoples of the world can find tree expression. Ail peoples, whether they be great Powers or small nations, have a ri&lt;dit to live in security and independence, without threats or menaces or the use of force. If we do not overthrow the forces of Dictatorship now, our turn will come sooner or later. We deny the right of any Power to commit acts of brigandage or to seek to attain its ends by means of force or the threat of force. We believe that there is no kind of dispute between nations which cannot be settled by peaceful methods, if the will is present. 1718 If Hitler had observed these principles there would not have been war to-day. 1 have said in the House of Commons that he alone could cause war. In spite of repeated warnings and declarations, he has himself chosen to tread a path which will be strewn with dead and dying. We have in this country made mistakes in the past; but all of us, whatever our views were, have hoped and prayed for peace. Our grave warnings, our determined declarations, our sincere appeals, have been unheeded, Hitler has made the war. With sadness, but with an iron will and an invincible spirit, we have joined issue. We shall live through anxious times. Enormous sacrifices will need to be made. But, with clear consciences, we shall know that we are fighting the last war for final peace and liberty—including the liberty of the German people themselves. This is a bitter hour for us all. It is a bitter hour for the Labour Party, which has always regarded peace with freedom as the greatest blessing of mankind. Those for whom I can especially speak are fighting for a world in which henceforth law shall rule instead of force. We do not want increased power for Britain in the world. We want no new lands. We do not want to destroy the German people, whose scholars, writers, musicians, democratic leaders and others have made such noble contributions to that European civilisation which Hitler seeks to destroy. We want—having paid an incalculable price—when the air raid sirens have been silenced and war is ended, to make a new start to build a world where peace will be eternal, and where the arts of peace may flourish for the enjoyment of the whole of mankind. In view of the high sentiments expressed by the President of the United States of America, we are assured of the moral support of the people of that great Republic. The whole of the British Commonwealth of Nations will rally round us. The conscience of the vast majority of the human race will sustain us. Now it is the duty of all of us, whoever we may be, to do all that lies in our power to help in this great cause, so that peace may come as quickly as possible. I hope the families w'hose members have been for the time being separated will bear the separation with fortitude. I hope the children in their new homes will be happy and be spared the horrors of war. I hope for those called upon for active service, success to their efforts. I hope, lastly, that the dread dark days will soon pass away, and that we shall see a new dawn, heralding peace, security and prosperity for all mankind. Until that day arrives, I am sure our people will show the calm ness which was shown to-day in London when the sirens gave out the first air-raid warning, which happily before long was followed by the “all clear” signal. 1 suppose we must get used to this experience. But, besides calmness, we need fortitude. We need that British bulldog determination which is perhaps the greatest of our national qualities. We need also to keep out of19 our hearts any hatred towards the peoples who are at war with us, and who are the victims of evil leadership. 1 bid you all, whatever may befall in the coming days, to be of good heart, and God be with you. VII. 3/y/ September, 1939. Broadcast by the Rt. Hon. Sir Archibald Sinclair, M.P., Leader of the Liberal Party. So we are at war ! We who hate war and count peace as the greatest of our blessings have been compelled to stand to arms. In this solemn moment my sympathy goes out to the mothers and fathers who have just said goodbye to their children as they are taken from their homes for evacuation. The success of the evacuation is one of many proofs that we are going into this war —not blindly or light-heartedly—but with our minds clear and determined to see it through. Nor is any one of us likely to forget that the Poles, just plain, ordinary, peaceful, home-loving people like you or me are to-night suffering all the horrors of invasion—invasion which they and their Government have done nothing to provoke. Their peaceful towns and villages are being bombarded from the air. Their troops are fighting bravely against the invader. We have pledged ourselves to help them. Our plain duty now is promptly to fulfil our undertaking. Why is Poland being invaded—for no reason but this—that the Poles stand in the path of the ambition and lust for power of one man Herr Hitler. Under his rule in Germany, the individual citizen has been enslaved by the State, men and women and children have been brutally ill-treated merely because of their race or religion, and he has depended not on the freely-expressed will of his people but on his Secret Police and the concentration camp for the preservation of his power. Wherever his rule has been extended—into Austria or Czecho-Slovakia—the Secret Police and the concentration camps have been established. The Nazi tentacles reach out to the continents of Africa and America. If Hitler were now to absorb the resources of Poland into his vast engine of waifare, every country east of the Rhine would become in a greater or lesser degree tributary to him. France and Britain would be left alone—to await the onslaught of Nazi power, immensely stronger than it is to-day, or to submit to the extinction of liberty For 150 years the Poles struggled for their independence ^hich now for twenty years they have enjoyed and which they are firmly determined to defend. Not less resolute are the brave people o France. They are a nation of peasants, dwelling for the most partin the countryside, loving peace but unwavering in their defence of freedom against tyranny and justice against arbitrary force. They know their duty to Poland and to the common cause of our three countries—and the whole manhood of France is now mobilised and dedicated to its performance. The struggle will be hard and long—the suffering will be intense—but neither our liberties nor our material prosperity can be preserved unless they are shared with all the peoples of the earth.* Our first task therefore—a long and arduous task—must be to break the yoke of Nazi tyranny and our next to build a peaceful order in Europe based on fair play and good faith. The greater the effort and the sacrifice that each one of us makes to secure victory, the sooner the carnage and the suffering will end. In the face of this supreme challenge to our civilisation, party divisions sink into insignificance, but I know that my fellow Liberals everywhere, as always, will shrink from no sacrifice to preserve our freedom and to assert the rule of law. What is at stake in this great conflict is your right and mine, and the rights of other plain and ordinary people like us in this and other countries to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Let us in that cause, like the authors of the American Declaration of Independence, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes and our sacred honour. VIII. 3rd September, 1939. Broadcast by the British Prime Minister to the German People German people ! Your country and mine are now at war. Your Government has bombed and invaded the free and independent State of Poland, which this country is in honour bound to defend. Because your troops were not withdrawn in response to the Note which the British Government addressed to the German Government, war has followed. With the horrors of war we are familiar. God knows this ^ country has done everything possible to prevent this calamity. But now that the invasion of Poland by Germany has taken place, it has become inevitable. You are told by your Government that you are fighting because Poland rejected your Leader’s offer and resorted to force. What are the facts ? The so-called “ offer ” was made to the Polish Ambassador in Berlin on Thursday evening, two hours before the announcement by your Government that it had been “ rejected.” So far from having been rejected, there had been no time even to consider it. Your Government had previously demanded that a Polish representative should be sent to Berlin within 24 hours to 2021 conclude an Agreement. At that time the Sixteen Points subse quently put forward had not even been communicated to the Polish Government. The Polish representative was expected to arrive within a fixed time to sign an agreement which he had not even seen. This is not negotiation. This is a dictate. To such methods no self-respecting and powerful State could assent. Negotiations on a free and equal basis might well have settled the matter in dispute. You may ask why Great Britain is concerned. We are con cerned because we gave our word of honour to defend Poland against aggression. Why did we feel it necessary to pledge our selves to defend this Eastern Power when our interests lie in the West, and when your Leader has said he has no interest to the West ? The answer is—and I regret to have to say it—that nobody in this country any longer places any trust in your Leader's word. He gave his word that he would respect the Locarno Treaty ; he broke it. He gave his word that he neither wished nor intended to annex Austria ; he broke it. He declared that he would not incorporate the Czechs in the Reich ; he did so. He gave his word after Munich that he had no further territorial demands in Europe ; he broke it. He gave his word that he wanted no Polish Provinces ; he broke it. He has sworn to you for years that he was the mortal enemy of Bolshevism ; he is now its ally. Can you wonder his word is, for us, not worth the paper it is written on ? The German-Soviet Pact was a cynical volte face, designed to shatter the Peace Front against aggression. This gamble failed. The Peace Front stands firm. Your Leader is now sacrificing you, the German people, to the still more monstrous gamble of a war, to extricate himself from the impossible position into which he has led himself and you. In this war we are not fighting against you, the German people, for whom we have no bitter feeling, but against a tyrannous and forsworn regime, which has betrayed not only its own people, but the whole of Western civilisation, and all that you and we hold dear. May God defend the right! IX. 2&gt;rd September, 1939. Broadcast by M. Edouard Daladier, Prime Minister of France, to the French People.

T/339 14th; 15th October 1939. €&gt;ll I have just received somewhat pained letter from India Office regarding our recent assault on B.B.C. suggesting inter alia (i) that they already have experts observing Empiiv broadcasts and that we need not incur expense on telegraphing our comments on them and Cii) that our function is to criticise Arabic broadcasts. 2. I propose to draw attention to (a) total lack of information regarding army beyond fact it is admirably concealed (b) lack of interest in death of Countess Errol in Kenya (c) danger of quoting without comment presumably baseless rumour spread by some American big wig that six submarines (unidentified but evidently German) were operating in Caribbean* Sea. 3. Can you suggest any further squibs ? I personally find French broadcasts more lucid cheerful and informative. Resident -Telegram ft r\i* Q r From Political Agent, Bahrain.

It would be convenient if these reports could be sent by telegram on Saturdays when there is anything of interest to communicate. Resident -Empire Co-operation in British Air Force Expansion On October 10th Sir Kingsley Wood, the British Air Minister, made his eagerly awaited speech on British Air Power. It was already known that the production of aircraft and training of pilots and personnel was proceeding on an enormous and expanding scale in the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa; and the Air Minister now revealed a tremendous new scheme of Empire Co-operation. Besides further increasing the production of aircraft throughout the Empire, the advanced training courses of pilots from the Dominions are to be concentrated in Canada. There, out of range of enemy attack, pilots will go from Britain, Australia and New Zealand to complete their final training. Thus in Canada will be duplicated that vast machine of training and production now in existence in the United Kingdom. The British and French Air Forces already more than equal the Cermar. Air Force in quantity and quality. But whereas Germany has reached her peak level of production and is finding it increasingly difficult to obtain the materials she needs for the future, the real concentration of the British Empire^ resources in men and material has only just begun. No action of the enemy can now prevent the Air Force of the Empire from gathering and maintaining overwhelming strength, the pressure of which must inevitably gain for the Allies the same mastery in the air that they already enjoy at sea. iGermany* 5 Dilemma &lt;£) Military expertz in London emphasise the difficulties in which Germany now finds herself. The Soviet-German alliance has robbed her of the fruits of her victory in Poland and enabled Russia to gain a predominant influence in her old Baltic Provinces, now Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. Thus Russia, not Germany, is now the master of the Baltic Sea. On the Western Front Germany is in a cleft stick: she must either attack or starve. The British and French Navies have effectually cut off her sea-borne supplies, and Soviet help to her in supplies and food is only problematical for Russia needs her supplies for her own use. Inside Germany conditions are deteriorating and the German Government find themselves on the horns of a dilemma. If Germany tries to attack on the Western Front she stands to lose a million men. If she remains inactive she will collapse. Threats to launch aerial attacks on Paris and London will not inti midate the French or English people and will only result in ten-fold reprisals on Germany*s own head. Germany realises this and therefore shrinks from such a venture which could only hasten her ultimate defeat. Meanwhile the winter is approaching and the people of Germany, through the folly of their Rulers, face a cold and hungry winter.Telegram From Political Agent, Bahrain.

Scarcity of war news is causing us some anxiety here and is the subject of complaint by both Press and public. We appreciate difficulties of supplying fuller information at present, but are perturbed by prevalence of rumours in India sometimes fantastic and usually unfavourable 4 to British prestige. We are dealing with this as far as possible but should be in better position to counter it if India were receiving more liberal supply of news. Moreover, in absence of news from England, tendency is to accept German broadcasts as correct and to look to loremgn countries generally for information as to progress of war. Somewhat unexhilatating tone of British Broadcasting Corporation news encourages this tendency. As a result, general impression is of sweeping enemy successes and inaction on part of Britain and France. We fully recognise value of principles upon which Ministry of Information is acting and lack of actual war news in present stage of war, but feel the something more encouraging is required to maintain optimism in India.

Dear Prior, INDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL, S.W.i. 30th September, 1939. ^our telegrams of the 18th September (T/247) and 24th / September IT/269) coimaenting on certain recent B.B.C.broad casts have received attention here. It is assumed that they relate to the Empire broadcasts in English and not to the Arabic news from London. Though the Empire news broadcasts have been open to some criticism, you will appreciate that the B.B.C. have to give the news such as it is and that in making up their news programmes they have to meet the difficulty at present of a real dearth of British news. This is a matter which, it is to be expected, will right itself in course of time. *ou may be sure that there is no lack of criticism of the B.B.C. English news services from those whose ordinary business it is to watch them. While, therefore, there is no harm in bringing to notice how they strike listeners in posts such as Bahrain it is felt that there is no necessity t incur the time and expense involved in telegraphing comments on the general aspects of these broadcasts which are open to obvious criticism and receive it in plenty. If,however, you should at any time have further comments on the Empire news broadcasts - more particularly from the point of view of the local reactions - we shall be glad to have them if you v/ill send them by mail. We are of course ofiicially more concerned with the / Arabic The Hon’ble Major C.G.Prior, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.Arabic news broadcasts and the reactions to them in the Gulf, and v/e are anxious that we should continue to receive, by telegram when necessary, the contributions, suggestions and comments of the political officers in the Gulf which have always been appreciated and welcomed by the 3.B.C.

Curiosity in German naval circles is rife regarding present dispositions of battleships, battle cruisers and aircraft carriers. Foregoing serves to explain Admiralty attitude in the face of repeated enemy’s allegations. They do not wish to be drawn more than bare denial and it is important that neutral opinion should recognise these recurrences and j+v* baseless German claims what they in fact are namely a / tactical game which we refuse to play.

PoliticalI; FPSi:CH GA INS ON TFE GEHI.IAN EFFOF^S TO FALSIFY THE FA CTS. The Tropaganda T'inistry continues to attempt to minimise the value of French gains on the Western Front, and states that Saarbrucken, though an open town only two miles inside the Frontier, still lies in German hands. It also claims that the Siegfried line remains intact and suffers merely from French long range artillery bombardment. Fy such boasts as these Germany evidently hopes to provoke the Allies into making frontal attacks at the expense ox heavy casualties, similar to those so recklessly incurred by Germany herself only a few days ago. The Allies, however, have no intention of repeating the errors made in the last and are therefore this time conducting a methodical siege of Germany. These careful tactics have already achieved &lt;=*t very small cost results of immense value. Hitler on the ocher hand finds himself facing internal disruption, and to combat this, is forced to make fruitless and expensive attacks in the desperate hope of recovering his lost prestige. The French heavy artillery are solidly established on the heights surrounding Saarbrucken, and dominate all approaches t&gt;0 the ' own * Strategically that once important road and railway junction is now much lost to the Germans as if alreadyin the Allies’ hands. Its actual capture is of small importance, and the French of course refuse to follow the German example set an Poland of shelling open towns and slaughtering civilians, nor do they favour wasting men and material in taking the town by assault. Meanwhile the continued presence of French troops on German soil has deeply affected the morale of the Ihineland population /-■■ - 2 - tf population, from whom the Nazis had as long as possible concealed the truth. Over two million people have already been evacuated from this region, an experience not endured by Germans since the Napoleonic Wars. Lastly it is significant that Hitler's propagandists have omitted all mention of Germany* s economic losses in the Saar. There the actions of the Allied Artillery and Air Forces have brought all industry to a standstill and deprived Germany of more coal and iron than she obtained by the capture of Polish Silesia. Thus it is obvious that the Allies have inflicted far greater damage on the enemy than the occupation of a few hundred square miles of German territory, and Herr Hitler’s efforts to minimise his losses will not deceive unbiassed observers.CONFIDENTIAL. r The Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf presents his com pliments to !• The Political Agent, Kuwait. 2* The Political Agent, Bahrain. 3.

Far from it being true as suggested by German pro paganda that British economic structure ie cracking Britieh resources are only beginning to be developed. whereas Germany has no foreign exchange end a smaller gold reserve than in 19.18 the annual income on British foreign investments alone is 0.200,000,000/- a year and in gold, foreign exchange and income yielding investments Britain has £.100/- a head of population as compared with £.47/- a heed in wealth(y) United States. Cu^ annual national income ia over £.107/- a head compared with £.6*.10ah in Germany and although Britain has a budget expendi ture of £.2000,000,000/- a year at present, if half of British national income is devoted to war expenditure Britain can eaei! spend double what she is now spending on war efforts. The income-tax on lower range income is less than one fifth of wha« it is in Germany. Carried Germans pay income tax over £.65/- married British only over £.225/-. Britain also has 8 labour strength of 1,50Qp00/men on which to draw, one half of whom cs^ be employed in s-rmement industry. Germany has a labour scarej By controlling Atlantic sea route we draw on vast economic res^ | see of Dominions. There are ample feed stocks in Britain. Rationing has net even been introduced yet. Knde. SiSCRKTAHY OF STATE FOR INDIAgftTTAi:; aiij — -:t iscci:ci.:tc ccirr^AsT. Economic conditions in Britain and Germany to-day present an amazing contrast. Germany under the Nazi regime, blindly pursuing a policy aimed at the domination of Europe by force, has in the past few years so exhausted her inter national credit that now she possesses no foreign exchange and an even smaller gold reserve than she had at the end of the last v;ar. Indeed so little gold has she that it is even doubtful if she will be able to pay the harbour dues on her merchant ships which have sought refuge in neutral ports. On the other hand the annual income oh British foreign invest ments alone totals £ 200,000,000/- a year, and Britain has in gold, foreign exchange and overseas investments £ 100/- per head of the population in comparison with £ 47/- per head even in a wealthy country like the United States. Besides these, the British national income in the United Kingdom is over £ 107/- per head of the population as compared with £ 62/10 in Germany; and although Britain at present is meeting a budget expenditure of £ 2000,000,000/- a year, she can, even if she devotes half of the British national j income to war expenditure, easily snend more than double the amount she is now spending on her war efforts. Furthermore it is worth noting that in Britain the income tax on small income is less than one-fifth of that levied in Germany; and whereas married Germans pay income tax on incomes of £ 65/- a year and over, married Britains pay no tax at all on annual incomes of less than £ 225/-. Also in contrast to Germany's labour shortage Britain has a reserve labour strength of 1,500,000 on which to draw, one half of whom can be employed in the armament industry. Again MAgain it is well-known that the Germans have long been even in peace time, to a system of strict food and this now grows more severe every week. For ermans may now buy only one egg a week and can eat meat only every third day. In Britain on the other hand there are ample stocks of food, and by controlling the sea routes she is able to draw on the vast economic resources ol the Dominions for all her present and future needs.Printed in England.

Though the German Propaganda Ministry my declare that the grip of the British on the North Sea has already been broken there are as yet no signs of the German Navy and Air Force substa.ntiating that a . assertion. On the British side no sweeping claims are made. Bare facts are left to tell the tale. “The destruction of seven German submarines within one week' , says the New York Herald Tribune, 'is far beyond the greatest anti U boat achievements of the last war'. 'This', continues the same paper, 'is a punishment which no submarine fleet can permanently withstand, and implies that the British anti-submarine devices must be working effectively'. The New York Herald Tribune then goes on to refer to the German raids on Rosyth and Scapa Flow and says 'Chamber- lain puts the German losses on both days at eight planes out of an estimated thirty. This is an appalling death rate to ask men to face consistently and is out of all proportion to the gains made'. The Boston Herald of 19th October says of the same attacks 'The German air raids on the British Fleet do not threaten the primacy of Britain as a Sea Power. No British ship was sunk and the damage to the few hit by bombs was in no case irreparable'. 'If', concludes the paper, 'this is what the Germans regard as totalitarian warfare, the British may feel comfortably secure'. Comments such as these from American news-papers of high/ft- - K - 2 - in high standing shew that neutral opinion is not deluded by the lies emanating from the Berlin Propaganda Ministry. Outside Germany, at any rate, truth will prevail. / 1.3 $ j°- 2 7 v* *&amp; CONFIDENTIAL. No. C/587.

It has been alleged that if His Majesty’s Government had made their position more clear in 1914, the great catastrophe could have been avoided. His Majesty’s Government are resolved that on this occasion there shall be no such tragic misunderstanding.” Herr Hitler’s reply to this warning, given in conversation with Sir Neville Hender son, the British Ambassador at Berlin, a day later, was that Germany had nothing to lose by war and that Great Britain had a great deal to lose. Herr Hitler added in a second conversation that to-day he was fifty years old, and he preferred war now to when he was fifty-five or sixty. Events thereafter, as these documents show, moved rapidly to their climax. Sir Neville Henderson flew to London with a message to the British Government offering friendship if they would acquiesce in Germany’s impos ing her will on the Polish nation. Sir Neville Henderson returned to Berlin with the reply that Britain was ready for an Anglo-German understanding, but only on a basis of a peaceful and freely-negotiated solution of the Polish question. He gave Herr Hitler an assurance, when he saw him, that the Polish Governmeut was prepared to enter into discussions. Herr Hitler’s only answer was that his army was ready and eager for battle. On the following day, August 29th, Herr Hitler expressed his willing ness to negotiate; but he demanded that a special Polish representative should arrive in Berlin within less than 30 hours—that is to say, by midnight, August 30th-31st—with power to accept whatever terms the German Government might iu the meantime pronounce. P. T. O.■ L' 1 It was pointed out to him that this was an unreasonable request and that any proposal that he had to make should be made through the Polish Ambassador in Berlin in accordance with the usual diplomatic procedure. When midnight struck on August 30th-31st, the German Government declared that the ultimatum had expired and that their proposals liad been rejected, although these proposals were not made known until the evening of August 31st, when they were broadcast. In the early hours of September 1st, Germany invaded Poland. Two days later, Great Britain went to war in fulfilment of her solemn pledges. His Holiness Pope Pius XII and Signor Mussolini had both made last minute efforts for neace, which had come to nought through the action of the German Government in invading Poland. Such is the story told by these documents, lo posterity they will prove that the war which is raging in Europe to day is a war made by one Government—the German Government.

THE LAWS OP CONTRABAND By September 16th the British Navy had confiscated 48,500 tons of oil destined for Germany, Oil to a modern army - like his camel to a bedu - constitutes practically all its locomotion. The quantities required are incredibly great:and the fact that so much has been confiscated already before the war has reached its twentieth day shows the direction and the slow but certain policy of the Democratic plan 0 This action of the British Contraband Control is no more spectacular than is the keeping of water from a palm tree no visible catastrophe occurs: there is no lopping of branches no cutting of roots: all that happens is that the palm tree dies.’ It dies because the nourishment that it requires cannot reach it e The whole policy of the British Navy today is to achieve this objecto The seas are already cleared of German ships: the last of the submarines will eventually lie buried in their nameless grave; and in the meantime their task v/ill become increasingly difficult with the full establishment of the convoy system° Woek by week the French and British Navies are perfecting their instrument of Economic War e What have they achieved already? In two weeks they have seized about £1,000,000 worth of goods, 48,500 tons of petroleum, 41,850 tons of iron ore, 7,900 tons of haematite ore, 30,100 of manganese ore, 15,000 of aluminium ore, 7,300 of wood pulp and 15,000 of phosphates.2 Each of these products is vital to a country at war. The manganese ore captured is a 14th part of Germany* s imports in a whole year. Two thirds of her iron ore must come from abroad and are liable to capture. And as for petroleum - if she had even the whole of Russia, Poland and Rumania to draw from - to have consumed over 7,500,000 tons last year in peace time: her production was 550,000 and is unlikely to rise to over 1,000,000 for some time: and there is no doubt she will need accumulated large quantities (a three months* supply is estimated) and in any case the physical difficulties of storage prevent the building of substantial reserves: she must rely on imports at the rate of 6 or 7,000,000 tons a year - which she can get only from Rumania or Russia. Russia, with an army in the field, is not likely to have any oil to spare: her surplus in 1938 was less than 1,000,000 tons: and as for Rumania, her last year’s total was only 4,500,000 tonsl 1 '^ An enormous deficit must still be made good if German tanks and lorries are to crowd the roads behind the Siegfried line, if German aeroplanes are to darken the western skies. The British Navy’s task is to see to it that this enormous deficit is not made good by imports from lands across the sea. How is this task accomplished? When a country is blockaded it means that all ships going in or coming out are stopped and seised. But Germany is not to be blockaded. Her commerce with neutral countries is allowed, and only such ^foods forbidden as may help her troops in war: their supply She is calculated at least 1^000,000 tons a year to carry on the war. Less than a third of that can be produced, within the Reich: she has not Contraband Control arms (i) p r0 m the Times, 25th September, 1939.arms, ammunition, explosives or articles and materials used to make explosives; fuels, aircraft, ships, land transport and any thing used in their construction or preparation; all tools, implements, maps, or documents useful in operations of war; coin, bullion, currency, and metal or material used in the manufacture of such; and - in a second category - food, fodder, clothings, and the materials used to make them. These can and will he seized on any neutral ship. But while, in a blockade, the ship itself would be seised and confiscated, in the present circumstances the cargo only is taken, its destina tion is decided in a Prize Court according to the rules of international lav/, and is either confiscated, requisitioned, sold o:r ’ “ ^ found to have been unjustly taken - returned to its owners. A vast organisation lies behind this quiet procedure. In almost every corner of the globe, all possible sources of supply open to the enemy are watched. Through financial houses, insurance and transport organisations, etc., the progress of contraband is followed: at every stage in their devious journey, the goods destined for the enemy are delayed until often their final capture is decided only when they have come to within convenient distance of a British port. The actual seizure is but the last act in a drama that has been pursued in secret across the oceans of one world, meanwhile many bases have been estab lished for inspection and control (Kirkwall, 7/eymouth, the Downs, and North Foreland in Britain, Gibraltar and Haifa in the mediterranean), Here neutral ships call and receive facilities as soon as possible to continue on their voyage - and since those that come of their own accord are attended to first many neutrals now help in this work of control by prompt compliance. Germany watches these sea-defeats with grov/ing and impotent rage. She cries out against 'lawless pressure 1 ', regardless herself • • • • •J - A - (0 herself of lav/ when she sinks neutral ships without warning, and shows by the violence of her calumnies the depth of her fear. Beyond her quick and bloody triumphs against the small heroic nations, she sees in the distance, slow but inevitable as Death, the spectre of defeat. Hitler is a maniac with a loaded v/eapon in his hand; he could not be kept from shooting: he can, and will, be prevented from re-loading to shoot a second time. The strength of Britain’s ITavy will take from him eventually the means of continuing his war. Friendly care for neutrals It is impossible to carry out the isolation of Germany without inconvenience to neutral trade: but Britain is doing all she can to make that trade easjr wherever it is not destined for Germany. To say that she starves the inhabitants of neutral countries is one of those lies whose stupidity is shown by the ease with which they are refuted: many of the neutral Governments themselves have been helping to organise the necessary control in uhe least troublesome manner and friendly negotiations are already under way. ho difficulty at all is made to the normal imports oi neutral states: if they show - as in one case - a sudden leap upwards since the outbreak of war, pressure is naturally brought to bear upon them b 3 / means fully recognised by international law. It is a slow and undemonstrative form of warfare: but it nas this ±act to its credit - that it has enabled Britain to vanquish her enemies for nearly 400 years.No. 847-A/0.

I enclose herewith a script in English and Arabic about Manamah which har&gt; been prepared by Mr. 3el^rave, together witlV four photographs. (/. &gt; A. * Political Agent, Bahrain. &amp; CBOMB CIVILIANS 4- 4* 4- O N September 1st, 1939, President Roosevelt appealed to the Governments of Great Britain, France, Italy, Germany and Poland, urging them to declare their determination not to bomb civilian populations or ^ unfortified cities. In reply to this appeal Herr Hitler said : “ That it is a precept of humanity in all circumstances to avoid bombing non-military objectives during military operations corresponds entirely to my own attitude and has always been advocated by me. “ I therefore give my unqualified agreement to the suggestion that the Governments involved in the present hostilities should publicly make corresponding declarations. For my part I have already publicly made known in my Reichstag speech that the German air force has received the command to confine itself in its operations to military objectives. “ It is a natural condition for the maintenance of this command that the opposing air force should keep to the same rules.” A fortnight after the war on Poland had begun Herr Hitler's attachment to humane principles had disappeared. A special communique issued from his headquarters declared : “ The excessive consideration of the German artillery and airmen for open towns, hamlets or villages was dependent on the condition that these places were not made a war zone by the enemy. “ As the Poles, without any regard to their own population, have rejected this condition, the German armed forces will henceforth break resistance in such places with all means at their disposal. “ The German air force, in co-operation with heavy artillery, will take all suitable measures to make clear the uselessness of resistance.” It should be noted that in Hitler's promise of September 2nd, no mention whatever was made of the condition that open townswere not to be made a war zone. The only condition required for the fulfilment of Herr Hitler’s pledge was that the enemy should also refrain from bombing civilians. This Poland certainly has done. Even Germany has not been able to charge the Poles with air attacks on civilians, for the reason, known to the whole world, that Poland had few aeroplanes, and was in no position to send them on bombing raids over Germany, even if she de sired to do so. NAZI ACTION What is still more damaging to the German argument is the fact that German planes had already begun the bombing of civilians and open towns several days before the threat to do so was issued by Hitler’s headquarters. Mr. A. J. Drexel Biddle, the American Ambassador in Warsaw, in a telegram to Washington dated September 8th—that is five days before the Nazi threat of September 13th—said that the German air force was “ taking advantage of every opportunity, without regard to the danger to the civilian population which may be involved ..... It is also evident that German bombers are releasing the bombs they carry even when in doubt as to the identity of their objectives.” The United States Ambassador then gave definite instances of attacks on unfortified places and the killing of civilians. These were his examples : (1) “ Attacks on my villa and that of my neighbour ; (2) “A heavy attack on modern apartment buildings in the suburbs of Warsaw situated one kilometre from military barracks; (3) “ The destruction of a sanatorium, involving the death of 10 children in woods near Otwock ; (4) “ The bombing of a refugee train on the way from Kutno ; (5) “ Damage done to a hospital train carrying a party of wounded soldiers which was plainly marked with the Red Cross on the roof and drawn up in the uncovered East Station in Warsaw ; (6) “The destruction of a Girl Guide hut in which 12 girls were killed.” Another telegram sent by the American Ambassador to Poland and received in Washington on September 13th described an air raid by the Germans in which bombs were dropped within 300 yards of the American Embassy.4 The telegram said : “ This place, a defenceless open village, was bombed at 11 a.m. to-day by a flight of four German aeroplanes, which dropped at least 12 bombs, not only on the outskirts, but also along the main street, 300 yards from the Embassy, as well as the Foreign Office, now located here. “ Verified casualties include 11 people killed and 40 seriously injured. Many business properties were damaged. The population was terrorized by the suddenness and unexpectedness of the raid.” In addition to this evidence there is the official statement issued by the Polish Embassy in London on September 13th. The statement declared that “ from the very beginning of hostilities which followed the German aggression, the German air forces were systematically and ruthlessly bombing open towns. The Polish Embassy desires to emphasize that up to September 3rd, that is on the day on which Great Britain and France found themselves at war with Germany, the following cities and open towns had been bombed : “ Warsaw and its suburbs, Aleksandrowo, Bialystok, Bydgoszcz, Chelmno, Czestochowa, Debica, Gdynia, Grodno, Grudziadz, Kalisz, Kobryn, Cracow, Kutno, Lwow, Lodz, Mielec, Piotrkow, Poznan, Pultusk, Radom, Radomsko, Rzeszow, Skierniewice, Tomaszow, Tarnobrzeg, Torun, Wilno, Zdunska, Wola, and Kielce. “ Since September 3rd scores of Polish towns, and even villages, have been raided by German bombers. Warsaw was raided repeatedly every day and even residential quarters and working-class districts suffered grievously from deliberate bombing. “ The casualties among the civilian population, especially among women and children, between September 1st and September 3rd amounted, according to official figures, to over 1,500 killed and many thousand wounded. “ During the last two days the Germans began the methodical bombing of open towns far removed from the battle zone. There is little doubt that this barbarous method is intended to paralyse the very life of the country. It has been applied in the case of the following cities : Lublin, Janow, Zamose, Chelm, Kowel, Zuck, the centres of which were bombed from low altitude. “ The above facts prove conclusively that Hitler’s undertaking not to bomb open towns, given in reply to President Roosevelt’s appeal, of September 2nd has been flagrantly disregarded.” Finally, an official British eye-witness, in a telegram sent from Bucharest on September 20th reported that the attack on Krzemieniec, the little provincial town in South Eastern Poland where the Polish Government and Foreign Diplomats had taken refuge, was a flagrant example of the bombing of open towns.This official eye-witness reported also that all the towns on the route between Wlodowa and Lwow had been bombed several times, and that the attacks on the centres of these towns, in which incendiary bombs were used, could only be described as indiscriminate. All the officials who had witnessed the air raids in Eastern Poland, declared this observer, were satisfied that the German air force, after destroying factories and means of communication, was given the deliberate task of terrorizing the civilian population in a non industrial zone one hundred miles or more behind the front with the purpose of making civil Government impossible. The excuse of inaccuracy in bombing was not valid because in these areas there were no anti-aircraft guns or Polish aircraft and the German bombers could fly very low. Several instances of machine-gunning from the air were witnessed, including an attack from a height of five hundred feet on motor cars containing refugees who were travelling on the road from Tarnopol to Kusow on September 14th. Cases of such attacks were witnessed at various times when there was no movement on the road. The British Vice-Consul at Katowice was machine-gunned from the air near Cracow in the first days of the war. THE 1907 CONVENTION It is interesting to recall that the Convention concerning the Laws and Customs of War on Land, which Germany signed at the Hague Peace Conference of 1907 expressly declares in Article 25 that: “ The attack or bombardment, by any means whatever, of undefended towns, villages, dwellings or buildings, is forbidden.” Striking, too, is the light which Nazi ruthlessness in Poland throws back on past disarmament offers of Herr Hitler and his Government. The bombardment of civilians in Poland shows how little the Nazi regime is prepared to stand by its own proposals. The German Government, in their Peace Plan of March 31st, 1936, declared (in Article 26) that:— “ They consider that the task of most immediate importance is to impart to aerial warfare the moral and humane atmosphere of, and the protection afforded by, the Geneva Convention, as far as non- combatants or wounded are concerned.” In Article 27, the Peace Plan said that the German Government proposed : “ The prohibition of dropping bombs of any kind whatsoever on open localities outside the range of the medium artillery of the fighting fronts.”INTERNATIONAL OPINION International opinion on the bombing of civilians has been authori tatively laid down in the Report of the Commission of Jurists on the revision of the rules of warfare which met at The Hague from December 1922 to February 1923. The Report was signed by representatives of the United States, the British Empire, France, Italy, Japan and the Netherlands. The relevant sections of this Report are, firstly, Article 22 : “ Aerial bombardment for the purpose of terrorizing the civilian population, of destroying or damaging private property not of military character, or of injuring non-combatants, is prohibited.' In addition Article 24 declares : “ 1. Aerial bombardment is legitimate only when directed at a military objective, that is to say, an object of which the destruction or injury would constitute a distinct military advantage to the belligerent. “ 2. Such bombardment is legitimate only when directed exclusively at the following objectives: military forces; military works; military establishments or depots ; factories constituting important and well-known centres engaged in the manufacture of arms, ammunition or distinctively military supplies; lines of com munication or transportation used for military purposes. “3. The bombardment of cities, towns, villages, dwellings or buildings not in the immediate neighbourhood of the operations of land forces is prohibited. In cases where the objectives specified in paragraph 2. are so situated that they cannot be bombarded without the indis criminate bombardment of the civilian population, the aircraft must abstain from bombardment.” BRITAIN’S REPLY Britain’s reply to the German announcement that henceforth Germany would bomb open towns and villages was immediate. In the House of Lords on September 13th, Viscount Halifax, the Foreign Secretary, after recalling that the British Government had agreed to restrict air bombardment, said : “ Whatever may be the rights of a belligerent army as against franc-tireurs, there can be no sort of justification for what must be indiscriminate bombardment, whether from the sea or air, of the civilian population. “ The restrictions which the British Government imposed on their own forces were based on the condition of similar restraint being observed by their opponents. 6Buildings blazing in Warsaw after a German air raid. * t Wreckage of a Jetvish children's home in Warsaw where a number of little children were killed by German bombs.“ The British Government must hold themselves eompletely free if such restraint is not in fact observed to take such action as they may deem appropriate.” On the following day, Britain’s attitude was further declared when Mr. Chamberlain, the Prime Minister, referred in the House of Commons to the German threat as follows : ‘ k His Majesty’s Government have noted this announcement, which on the face of it is in flat contradiction of the German Chancellor’s recent statement to the Reichstag, when he disclaimed any desire to make war on women and children. “ The restrictions we (like the French) have imposed upon the operations of our own forces were based upon the condition of similar restraint being observed by our opponents, and His Majesty’s Government must of course hold themselves free, if such restraint is not in fact observed, to take such action as they may deem appropriate. But I wish to add that whatever be the length to which others may go, His Majesty’s Government will never resort to deliberate attack on women, children, and other civilians for purposes of mere terrorism.”Confidential /O (g) J Yesterday evening, the 31st October, a great many people tuning In ready for the news at 1600 hours GcldeT* heard the last five minutes or so of a talk on Dutch neutrality by some extraordinary person who had just returned from Holland.

Events moved with such rapidity during the last fortnight of my mission to Berlin that it proved impossible at the time to give any consecutive account of them. If I have the honour to do so now, while the facts are still fresh in my memory, it is with the hope that such an account may be both of immediate interest to your Lordship and serve a purpose from the point of view of historical accuracy. 2 . Nevertheless, it is not these last minute manoeuvres which have the real importance, except in so far as they confirm the principles and demonstrate the methods and technique of Herr Hitler and of Nazism. A brief description of the background to August 1939 is consequently indispensable, if the events of the last few weeks are to be visualised in their proper perspective. 3. Herr Hitler and National Socialism are the products of the defeat of a great nation in war and its reaction against the confusion and distress which followed that defeat. National Socialism itself is a revolution and a conception of national philosophy. Contrary to democracy which implies the subordination of the State to the service of its citizens, Nazism prescribes the subordination of citizens to the service of the State, an all embracing Moloch, and the individual who rules that State. 4. So long as National Socialism remained an article for internal consumption, the outside world, according to its individual predilec tion, might criticise or sympathise or merely watch with anxiety. The government of Germany was the affair of the German people. It was not until the theory of German nationalism was extended beyond Germany’s own frontiers that the Nazi philosophy exceeded the limits compatible with peace. 5 . It would be idle to deny the great achievements of the man who restored to the German nation its self-respect and its disciplined orderliness. The tyrannical methods which were employed within Germany itself to obtain this result were detestable, but were Germany’s own concern. Many of Herr Hitler’s social reforms, in spite of their complete disregard of personal liberty of thought, word or deed, were on highly advanced democratic lines. The “ Strength through Joy” movement, the care for the physical fitness of the nation, and, above all, the organisation of the labour camps, an idea which Herr Hitler once told me that he had borrowed from Bulgaria, My Lord, London, September 20, 1939.8 are typical examples of a benevolent dictatorship. Nor can the appeal of Nazism with its slogans so attractive to a not over-discerning youth be ignored. Much of its legislation in this respect will survive in a newer and better world, in which Germany’s amazing power of ^ organisation and the great contributions which she has made in the past^ to the sciences, music, literature and the higher aims of civilisation and humanity will again play a leading part. 6. Nor was the unity of Great Germany in itself an ignoble ideal. It had long been the dream of some of the highest-minded of German thinkers, and it must be remembered that even in 1914 Germany was still immature as a political concept. In spite of the potential political danger for its weaker neighbours of a national philosophy which could so easily be distorted and extended bevond its due and legitimate frontiers, the unity of Great Germany was a reality which had to be faced, no less than that other reality, the paramount economic importance of Germany in Eastern, Central and bouth-Eastern Europe. It was not the incorporation of Austria and the Sudeten Germans in the Reich which so much shocked public opinion in the world as the unscrupulous and hateful methods which Herr Hitler employed to precipitate an incorporation which would probably have peacefully come in due course of its own volition and in accordance with the established principle of self-determination. 7. Yet even those methods might have been endured in a world which had experienced 1914-1918 and which sought peace as an end in itself, if Herr Hitler had been willing to accord to others the rights which he claimed for Germany. Revolutions are like avalanches, ^vhich once set in motion cannot stop till they crash to destruction it the appointed end of their career. History alone will determine whether Herr Hitler could have diverted Nazism into normal channels, whether he was the victim of the movement which he had initiated, or whether it was his own megalomania which drove it beyond the limits which civilisation was prepared to tolerate. 8. Be that as it may, the true background to the events of August 1989 was the occupation of Prague on the 15th March of this year, the callous destruction thereby of the hard and newly-won liberty of a free and independent people and Herr Hitler’s deliberate violation by this act of the Munich Agreement which he had signed not quite six months before. In 1939, as in 1914, the origin of war with Germany has been due to the deliberate tearing up by the latter of a scrap of paper. To the iniquities of a system which employed the barbarism of the middle ages in its persecution of the Jews, which subjected Roman Catholic priests and Protestant pastors alike to the inhumanities of the concentration camp for obedience to their religious faith, and which crushed out, in a fashion unparalleled in history, all individual liberty within the State itself, was added the violation not only of international agreements freely negotiated, but also of that principle of self-determination which Herr Hitler had [20104]! B 2- :r ' 'T' invoked with such insistence so long as it suited his own purpose to do so. Up to last March the German ship of State had flown the German national flag, and in spite of the “sickening technique” of * Nazism it was difficult not to concede to Germany the right both to control her own destiny and to benefit from those principles which were accorded to others. On the 15th March, by the ruthless suppres sion of the freedom of the Czechs, its captain hoisted the skull and crossbones of the pirate, cynically discarded his own theory of racial purity and appeared under his true colours as an unprincipled menace to European peace and liberty. 9. Two of the less attractive characteristics of the German are his inability either to see any side of a question except his own, or to understand the meaning of moderation. It would have been understandable to argue that a hostile Bohemia in the centre of Germany was an untenable proposition. But Herr Hitler could see no mean between rendering the Czechs innocuous as a potential enemy and destroying their liberty as an independent people. There is some surprising reason to believe that Herr Hitler himself was disagreeably and literally astonished at the reaction in Britain and the world generally, which was provoked by the occupation of Prague and his breach of faith with Mr. Chamberlain. But while he may have realised his tactical mistake, it did not deter him from prosecuting his further designs. 10. As I had reported to your Lordship, at the beginning of the year Germany’s immediate objectives, apart from the complete political and economic domination of Czecho-Slovakia and the eventual restoration of German colonies, were Danzig and Memel^^ Herr Hitler felt that it would not add much to the general execratioi^^ of his aggression and ill-faith in March if he settled these two problems simultaneously with Prague. The Democracies were, he thought, so averse to war that they would accept any fait accovipli. They would be less disturbed if everything was done at once. Thereafter, the agitation would, he anticipated, gradually subside until, after consolidating his gains, he was once more in a position to strike again. 11. With this plan in view the Lithuanian Government was at once browbeaten into surrendering Memel. The same method was employed at Warsaw, but the Poles were made of sterner stuff. Negotiations had been proceeding ever since Munich for a settlement of the Danzig and the Corridor question. After Prague Herr Hitler decided that they must be abruptly concluded, and Herr von Ribbentrop peremptorily dictated to the Polish Ambassador the terms which Herr Hitler would be pleased to impose on the Polish Government. The reply of the latter was given on the 26th March and constituted a refusal to accept a Dictate, while expressing readiness to continue free and equal discussion. Alarmed at the threatening attitude adopted by the German Government inconsequence of this refusal, the Polish Government mobilised part of its forces (the German army was already largely mobilised), and the British guarantee to Poland was given on the 31st March. 12. The Ides of March constituted in fact the parting of the ways and were directly responsible for everything which happened thereafter. Thenceforward no small nation in Europe could feel itself secure from some new adaptation of Nazi racial superiority and jungle law. The Polish guarantee was followed by unilateral guarantees on Britain’s part to Greece and Boumania as well as by an attempt on the part of the British and French Governments to induce the U.S.S.R. to join in a peace front against aggression, ill-faith and oppression. The Nazi Government, for its part and with considerable success in Germany, represented this attempt as a renewal of the alleged pre-war British policy of encirclement. As a war-cry for the German people it was exceedingly effective up to the signature of the Busso-German non-aggression pact on the 23rd August. The rest of Nazi propaganda was on two entirely contradictory lines either of which was destined, according to the development of the situation, to serve Herr Hitler’s purpose. The first spread the persistent report that Britain would never go to war for the sake of Danzig. It was calculated to undermine the confidence of the Poles and to shake the faith of the smaller Powers, as well as of the United States of America, in the determination of Britain to resist any further German aggression. The second represented Britain as resolved to make war at the first opportunity on Germany in any case and in order to crush her before she became a too formidable political and economic rival. Both were fallacies but ^ic Germans are a credulous race and, since the first has failed, - is the latter argumentation which forms the basis of Germany’s present war propaganda. 13. Up to the beginning of August, though the clouds were black and the peace front negotiations dragged on interminably, the situation remained serious but not immediately dangerous. Instead, however, of there being any sign of a relaxation of tension at Danzig the position there had gradually become more and more strained. From the end of March till the end of August all personal contact between Warsaw and Berlin was suspended. The remilitarisation of the Free City, alleged by the Germans to be purely defensive, but no less adaptable for offensive purposes, had proceeded apace, and other measures had been taken indicative of a German intention to effect a sudden coup there. The Poles for their part, in view of the great increase in arms smuggling, had been obliged to strengthen their customs inspectors by a number of frontier guards. They had also taken certain economic counter-measures of a nature to prejudice the trade of the Free City. 14. What was, however, even more ominous were the extensive preparations which were being made by the Germans for the6 twenty-fifth celebration of the battle of Tannenberg on the 27th August, and a German warship was scheduled to visit Danzig at the same time and ostensibly for the same purpose. Early in July I drew your Lordship’s attention to the menace involved by these equivocal preparations, which corresponded so closely to ^ Hitler’s usual technique of preparing for all eventualities, under cover of a plausible excuse. 15. The first mutterings of the storm were heard on the 4th August. At four posts on the Danzig-East Prussian frontier, the Polish Customs Inspectors were informed that they would not be permitted henceforward to carry out their duties. Alarmed at the gradual sapping of Polish rights and interests in the Free City, the Polish Commissioner General there was at once instructed to deliver a note to the Danzig Senate, warning the latter that the Polish Government would react in the strongest manner if the work of the inspectors was interfered with. The Senate subsequently denied that it had issued any instructions to the effect alleged but the German Government replied to what it described as the Polish ultimatum by a verbal note, which was handed by the State Secretary to the Polish Charge d’Affaires at Berlin on the 9th August. The Polish Government was therein warned that any further demand addressed to the Free City in the nature of an ultimatum or containing threats of reprisals, would at once lead to an aggravation of Polish-German relations, the responsibility for which would fall on the Polish Government. The latter retorted on the following day by a similar verbal note, denying the judicial right of Germany to intervene in the affairs between Poland and the Free City, and warning in its turn the German Government that “any futur^ intervention by the latter to the detriment of Polish rights anu s interests at Danzig would be considered as an act of aggression.’’ 16. I have little doubt but that the latter phrase served more than anything else to produce that final brainstorm in Herr Hitler’s mind on which the peace of the world depended, and upon which it always must have depended so long as the fate not only of Germany Out also of Europe, rested in the hands of a single irresponsible individual. 17. The tragedy of any dictator is that as he goes on, his entourage steadily and inexorably deteriorates. For lack of freedom of utterance he loses the services of the best men. All opposition becomes intolerable to him. All those, therefore, who are bold enough to express opinions contrary to his views are shed one by one, and he is in the end surrounded by mere yes-men, whose flattery and counsels are alone endurable to him. In my report on the events of 1988 I drew your Lordship’s special attention to the far reaching and unfortunate results of the Blomberg marriage. I am more than ever convinced of the major disaster which that—in itself—minor incident involved, owing to the consequent elimination from7 f Herr Hitler’s entourage of the more moderate and independent of his advisers, such as Field Marshal von Blomberg himself, Baron von Neurath, Generals Fritsch, Beck, &amp;c. After February of last year ^ Herr Hitler became more and more shut off from external influences and a law unto himself. 18. People are apt, in my opinion, to exaggerate the malign influence of Herr von Ribbentrop, Dr. Goebbels, Herr Himmler and the rest. It was probably consistently sinister, not because of its suggestiveness (since Herr Hitler alone decided policy), nor because it merely applauded and encouraged, but because, if Herr Hitler appeared to hesitate, the extremists of the party at once proceeded to fabricate situations calculated to drive Herr Hitler into courses which even he at times shrank from risking. The simplest method of doing this was through the medium of a controlled Press. Thus what happened in September last year, was repeated in March this year, and again in August. Dr. Goebbels’ propaganda machine was the ready tool of these extremists, who were afraid lest Herr Hitler should move too slowly in the prosecution of his own ultimate designs. 19. The 1988 stories of Czech atrocities against its German minority, were rehashed up almost verbatim in regard to the Poles. Some foundation there must necessarily have been for a proportion of these allegations in view of the state of excitable tension which existed between the two peoples. Fjxcess of zeal on the part of individuals and minor officials there undoubtedly was—but the tales of ill-treatment, expropriation and murder were multiplied a ^hundredfold. How far Herr Hitler himself believed in the truth of &gt;hese tales must be a matter for conjecture. Germans are prone in any case to convince themselves very readily of anything which they wish to believe. Certainly he behaved as if he did believe, and, even if one may give him the benefit of the doubt, these reports served to inflame his resentment to the pitch which he or his extremists desired. 20. Until the 8th August the campaign against the Poles had been relegated to the more discreet pages of the German press. Up to that date, public enemy No. 1 had been Great Britain and the alleged policy of encirclement. From that date, however, the stories of Polish atrocities began to take the leading place, and by the 17th August the campaign was in full swing. 21. Herr Hitler is a master of turning events to suit his own purpose, and the so-called ultimatum to the Danzig Senate of the 4th August and the subsequent foreign press comments on a Danzig “ climb down ” gave him the opportunity which he was seeking. The Polish note of the 4th August provided an excuse for the German note verbale of the 9th August, which provoked in its turn the Polish reply of the 10th August. In the midst of these exchanges Dr. Burckhardt, High Commissioner of the League of Nations for Danzig flew to Berchtesgaden in a last effort to place the position at [20104] R 88 Danzig on a more satisfactory footing. He saw Herr Hitler on the 11th August, while Count Ciano and Herr von Bibbentrop were meeting at Salzburg. 22. Intransigent as he appears to have been at his interview with Dr. Burckhardt, there is little doubt in my mind that Herr Hitler would have been far more so had he at the time been in possession of the text of the final paragraph of the Polish reply of 10th August, which had only been communicated to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs at Berlin on that day. He was aware of it, however, when Count Ciano visited him at Berchtesgaden immediately after Dr. Burckhardt’s departure, and it undoubtedly rendered unavailing the Italian Foreign Minister’s laudable intention of pouring oil on the troubled waters. Once again, as in 1988, the inexorable fatality of the Greek tragedy was in evidence, and the coincidence of the Polish note of the 10th August with the Ciano visit was a striking example of it. Count Ciano returned to Italy and a day or so later the Italian Ambassador at Berlin was hurriedly summoned to Borne. 28. Herr Hitler’s carefully calculated patience was, in fact, exhausted, and on the 18th August I telegraphed to your Lordship that I had come to the definite conclusion that, if peace was to be preserved, the present situation could not be allowed to continue and that the only alternative to war must be some immediate and mediatory action. In this connexion I repeated a suggestion which I had made some time previously, namely, that a personal letter should be addressed by the Prime Minister to Herr Hitler and be delivered by some emissary from London. Two days later I again telegraphed to the same effect, and stated my conviction tha4^ Herr Hitler had now finally decided upon some form of immediate action which would force the issue. I drew attention at the same time to the increased German military strength which had been assembled in East Prussia under cover of the Tannenberg anniversary and expressed my apprehension lest that celebration might prove the starting point for the action which Plerr Hitler con templated. I have little doubt but that such was Herr Hitler’s original and premeditated intention. 24. On the 21st August information reached me that the long expected but carefully concealed German military concentrations were already in progress, and that instructions had been given to complete them by the 24th August. A report which reached me at that time actually mentioned the 25th August as the date fixed for the German advance into Poland. 25. I shall return to this point later, but I must here refer to the bombshell which was exploded late in the evening of the 21st August by the announcement that negotiations had been concluded for the signature of a Busso-German non-aggression pact and that Herr von Bibbentrop would fly to Moscow on the 23rd to sign it.9 26. The secret, which on the German side had been known to not more than a few persons, had been well kept. It iiad been realised that German counter-negotiations had been proceeding throughout the summer, but it was hoped that they had been abandoned after the actual arrival at Moscow of the French and British military missions. Comment on the subject is, however, out side the scope of this report, except in so far as it concerns the effect of this announcement on the German public. The first impression in Berlin was one of immense relief, partly at the removal of the dreaded Russian air menace, but more particularly because, in the minds of a public which had been led to believe by Goebbels pro paganda that the British negotiations with the U.S.S.R. were really encirclement with a view to a preventive war, the conclusion of a Russo-German non-aggression pact meant that peace was assured, since Britain would not, it was told, fight for Danzig or Poland without Russian aid. Once more the faith of the German people in the ability of Herr Hitler to obtain his objective without war was reaffirmed. Its satisfaction was, however, short-lived and the deception consider able when it was realised that Britain’s word to Poland did not depend on Russian support. Those who had fought the war of nazism against communism w T ere furthermore puzzled by this complete volte-face. The Nazi theory of racial purity had been discarded in March and in August a second of its basic principles was thus equally relegated to the scrap-heap. To most Germans the old hereditary enemy is Russia, nor was their confidence in the sincerity of her good intentions towards Germany greatly fortified by this exhibition of Russian ill-faith towards the Western Democracies. Nevertheless, wis a diplomatic coup, the Russo-German pact was a strikingly success ful and surprising one. It is devoutly to be hoped that it may prove as Pyrrhic as are most diplomatic victories. 27. At the moment when Herr von Ribbentrop was preparing to fly to Moscow, I received shortly before 9 p.m. on the 22nd August your Lordship’s instructions to convey without delay a personal letter from the Prime Minister to Herr Hitler. I at once got into communication with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, and in the course of the night an interview was arranged for the following day. I left Berlin at 9 • 30 on the morning of the 23rd August accompanied by the State Secretary and Herr Hewel, in an aeroplane provided for me by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. 28. I reached Salzburg about midday and I had my first audience with Herr Hitler at Berchtesgaden at 1 p.m. on the 23rd August in the presence of Baron von Weizsacker and Herr Hewel. The correspondence, including the text of the Prime Minister’s letter, of Herr Hitler’s reply and my own telegraphic record of my two conversations with the Chancellor, is to be found in the Blue Book presented to Parliament and publishing the documents concerning German-Polish relations and the outbreak of hostilities between Great Britain and Germany on the 3rd September, 1939.C) O See Cmd. 6106, Nos. 56, 57, 58, 60. [20104] b 410 29. I need not say more here than that the three main points of the Prime Minister’s letter were (1) insistence on the determina tion of His Majesty’s Government to fulfil their obligations to Poland; (2) their readiness, if a peace atmosphere could be created, to discuss all the problems at issue between our two countries, and (8) their anxiety, during a period of truce, to see immediate direct discussion initiated between Germany and Poland in regard to the reciprocal treatment of minorities. r * 80. In Herr Hitler’s reply of the 28rd August he declared that Great Britain’s determination to support Poland could not modify his policy as expressed in the German verbal note to the Polish Government of the 9th August that he was prepared to accept even a long war rather than sacrifice German national interests and honour, and that, if Great Britain persisted in her own measures of mobilisation, he would at once order the mobilisation of the whole of the German forces. 81. At my first interview 7 with him on that day, Herr Hitler was in a mood of extreme excitability. His language as regards the Poles and British responsibility for the Polish attitude was violent, recriminatory and exaggerated. He referred, for instance, to 100,000 German refugees from Poland, a figure which was at least five times greater than the reality. Again I cannot say whether he was persuaded or persuaded himself of the reality of these figures. At my second interview, when he handed me his reply, he had recovered his calm but was not less uncompromising. No longer, he told me, did he trust Mr. Chamberlain. He preferred war, he said, when he was 50 to wdien he was 55 or 60. He had himself always sought^ and believed in the possibility of friendship with England. He now^ realised, he said, that those who had argued the contrary had been right and nothing short of a complete change in British policy towards Germany could ever convince him of any sincere British desire for good relations. My last remark to him was that I could only deduce from his language that my mission to Germany had failed and that I bitterly regretted it. 32. I flew back from Berchtesgaden to Berlin the same evening. I had in fact little hope that either the Prime Minister’s letter or my own language to Herr Hitler, however direct and straightforward, would give him pause. The Russian pact had, I felt, created in his opinion a situation which v 7 as favourable to his designs and I believed his mind to be definitely made up. Though he spoke of his artistic tastes and of his longing to satisfy them, I derived the impression that the corporal of the last war was even more anxious to prove what he could do as a conquering Generalissimo in the next. 83. Nevertheless the visit to Berchtesgaden may after all have postponed the disaster for a week. Herr von Ribbentrop flew back to Germany with the signed Russo-German Agreement and HerrHitler returned to Berlin the night of the 24th August. I have some reason to believe—though I cannot confirm it—that the order for the German Army to advance into Poland was actually issued for the night of the 25th-26th August. It is difficult otherwise to find justification for the various orders and arrangements which came into force on the 26th and 27th August. In the afternoon of the 25th August itself all telephone communication between Berlin and London and Paris was unexpectedly cut off for several hours. The celebrations at Tannenberg were cancelled on the 26th and the Party Rally at Nuremberg on the 27th August; all Naval, Military and Air Attaches at Berlin were refused permission to leave the city without prior authority being obtained from the Ministry of War. All German airports were closed from that date, and the whole of Germany became a prohibited zone for all aircraft except the regular civil lines. All internal German air services were also suspended. Moreover as from the 27th a system for the rationing of food-stuffs and other commodities throughout Germany came into force. That this latter and—for the public—depressing measure should have been adopted prior to the outbreak of war can scarcely be explained, except on the assumption that war should actually have broken out on the 26th August. 34. The fact may well be, as I imagine it was, that Herr Hitler had had in consequence of the Prime Minister’s letter one last hesitation and countermanded the orders to his Army, whereas the other arrangements w T ere allowed to proceed unchecked. But it was not the horrors of war which deterred him. He had unlimited confidence in the magnificent army and air force which he had fi^e-created and he was certainly not averse to putting them to the test so far as Poland was concerned. In two months, he told me, the war in the East would be ended and he would then, he said, hurl 160 divisions against the Western Front if England was so unwise as to oppose his plans. His hesitation was due rather to one final effort to detach Britain from Poland. Be that as it may, at about 12-45 on the 25th August, I received a message to the effect that Herr Hitler wished to receive me at the Chancellery at 1-30 p.m. At that meeting he made to me the verbal communication which is recorded in the Blue Book.( 2 ) 35. Briefly put, Herr Hitler’s proposals therein dealt with two groups of questions : (a) the immediate necessity of a settlement of the dispute between Germany and Poland, and (b) an eventual offer of friendship or alliance between Germany and Great Britain. My interview with Plerr Hitler, at which Herr von Ribbentrop and Dr. Schmidt were also present, lasted on this occasion over an hour. The Chancellor spoke with calm and apparent sincerity. He described his proposals as a last effort, for conscience sake, to secure good relations with Great Britain, and he suggested that I should fly to12 London myself with them. I told his Excellency that, while I was fully prepared to consider this course, I felt it my duty to tell him quite clearly that my country could not possibly go back on its word to Poland, and that, however anxious we were for a better under- g standing with Germany, we could never reach one except on the basis of a negotiated settlement with Poland. 3G. Whatever may have been the underlying motive of this final gesture on the part of the Chancellor, it was one which could not be ignored, and, with your Lordship’s consent, I flew to London early the following morning (26th August), on a German plane which was courteously put at my disposal. Two days were spent by His Majesty’s Government in giving the fullest and most careful consideration to Herr Hitler’s message, and on the afternoon of the 28th August I flew back to Berlin with their reply.( 3 ) Therein, while the obligations of His Majesty’s Government to Poland were reaffirmed, it was stated that the Polish Government were ready to enter into negotiations with the German Government for a reasonable solution of the matter in dispute on the basis of the safeguarding of Poland’s essential interests, and of an international guarantee for the settlement eventually arrived at. His Majesty’s Government accordingly proposed that the next step should be the initiation of direct discussions between the Polish and German Governments on that basis and the adoption of immediate steps to relieve the tension in the matter of the treatment of minorities. Furthermore, His Majesty’s Government undertook to use all their influence with a view to contributing towards a solution which might be satisfactory to both parties and which would, they hoped, prepare the way for th^ negotiation of that wider and more complete understanding between' Great Britain and Germany which both countries desired. Finally, after a reference to a limitation of armaments, His Majesty’s Government pointed out that, whereas a just settlement of the Polish question might open the way to world peace, failure to do so would finally ruin the hopes of a better understanding between our countries and might well plunge the whole world into war. 87. Before continuing the record of events after my return to Berlin on the evening of the 28th August, it is necessary to give a brief account of what had happened after my meeting with the Chancellor at 1-80 on the 25th August. At 5 p.m. on that day Herr Hitler had received the French Ambassador and given him a letter for communication to M. Daladier. Its general tenour was a sugges tion to France, with whom Germany was stated to have no quarrel, to abstain from further support of Poland. It received a dignified answer from the French Government, which was published on the 27th August. Appeals for peace were made at this time to both the German and Polish Governments as well as to other Powers by the Pope and the President of the United States of America. Though f 3 ) Idem No. 74.( 4 ) Idem No. 75. 13 &lt;r they received a favourable response from the Polish Government, they received scant consideration from Germany. 38. On the evening of the 25th August the Anglo-Polish Pact had been signed in London. Though it had been under negotiation for several months, its signature gave great offence to Herr Hitler, who was at first inclined to regard it as the reply of His Majesty’s Government to his message to them. His immediate retort was the announcement on the morning of the 26th August that Herr Forster had been appointed Reichsoberhaupt, or Head of the State of Danzig. At the same time the German concentrations against Poland began to reach their final stage. 39. Thereafter there was a lull for two days pending my return to Germany with the reply of His Majesty’s Government. I had left London at 5 p.m. on the 28th August, and at 10*30 p.m. I was received by Herr Hitler at the Chancellery and handed to him that reply, together with a German translation. I sent to your Lordship a full record of my conversation with the Chancellor the same night. ( 4 ) 40. On this occasion Herr Hitler was again friendly and reason able and appeared to be not dissatisfied with the answer which I had brought to him. He observed, however, that he must study it carefully and would give me a written reply the next day. 41. I would mention incidentally that both that evening and the next, when I visited Herr Hitler again and was handed his reply, mothing was left undone to enhance the solemnity of the occasion. % considerable but quite expressionless crowd was waiting outside the Chancellery and a guard of honour awaited me in the courtyard of the main entrance. In view of what has been reported to the contrary, I desire to bear witness here to the fact that throughout the whole of those anxious weeks neither I nor my staff received anything but the utmost courtesy and civility from all Germans, except on one occasion to which I shall refer later. 42. Such information as reached me during the course of the day of the 29th August tended to represent the atmosphere as not unfavourable and to foreshadow Herr Hitler’s readiness to open direct negotiations with the Poles. I was therefore somewhat disappointed on being summoned to the Chancellery at 7*15 that evening to find the Chancellor in a far less reasonable mood than on the previous evening. The German midday Press had reported the alleged murder of six German nationals in Poland, and this story, which was probably fabricated by the extremists in fear lest he was weakening, together with the news of the Polish general mobilisation, had probably upset him. I sensed in any case a distinctly more uncompromising attitude on Herr Hitler’s part when he handed me his answer. Iread it through carefully, and, though it reiterated his demand for the whole Corridor as well as Danzig, I made no comment till I reached the phrase at the end of it, in which, after a grudging acquiescence in direct discussions with the Poles solely by way of proof of Germany’s sincerity in her desire for lasting friendship with Great Britain, it was stated that “ the German Government counted upon the arrival in Berlin of a Polish Emissary with full powers on the following day, Wednesday, the 30th August.” I pointed out to his Excellency that this phrase sounded very much like an ultimatum (‘‘hatte den Klang eines Ultimatums ”). This was strenuously and heatedly denied by Herr Hitler himself, supported by Herr von Bibbentrop. According to the former this sentence merely emphasised the urgency of the moment, not only on account of the risk of incidents when two mobilised armies were standing opposite one another, but also when Germans were being massacred in Poland. In this latter connection his Excellency asserted that “ I did not care how many Germans were being slaughtered in Poland.” This gratuitous impugnment of the humanity of His Majesty’s Government and of myself provoked a heated retort on my part and the remainder of the interview was of a somewhat stormy character. 43. It was closed, however, by a brief and in my opinion quite honest harangue on Herr Hitler’s part in regard to the genuineness of his constant endeavour to win Britain’s friendship, of his respect for the British Empire, and of his liking for Englishmen generally. 44. I should like to state here, parenthetically but emphatically, that Herr Hitler’s constant repetition of his desire for good relations with Great Britain was undoubtedly a sincere conviction. He wiU| prove in the future a fascinating study for the historian and thT biographer with psychological leanings. Widely different explana tions will be propounded, and it would be out of place and time to comment at any length in this despatch on this aspect of Herr Plitler’s mentality and character. But he combined, as I fancy many Germans do, admiration for the British race with envy of their achievements and hatred of their opposition to Germany’s excessive aspirations. It is no exaggeration to say that he assiduously courted Great Britain, both as representing the aristocracy and most success ful of the Nordic races, and as constituting the only seriously dangerous obstacle to his own far-reaching plan of German domina tion in Europe. This is evident in Mein Kampf, and, in spite of what he regarded as the constant rebuffs which he received from the British side, he persisted in his endeavours up to the last moment. Geniuses are strange creatures, and Herr Hitler, among other paradoxes, is a mixture of long-headed calculation and violent and arrogant impulse provoked by resentment. The former drove him to seek Britain’s friendship and the latter finally into war with her. Moreover, he believes his resentment to be entirely justified. He failed to realise why his military-cum-police tyranny should be repugnant to British ideals of individual and national freedom and( 5 ) Idem No. 78. 15 liberty, or why he should not be allowed a free hand in Central and Eastern Europe to subjugate smaller and, as he regards them, inferior peoples to superior German rule and culture. He believed he could buy British acquiescence in his own far-reaching schemes by offers of alliance with and guarantees for the British Empire. Such acquiescence was indispensable to the success of his ambitions and he worked unceasingly to secure it. His great mistake was his complete failure to understand the inherent British sense of morality, humanity and freedom. 45. It must be mentioned here that the concluding passage of the Chancellor’s reply to His Majesty’s Government had contained a statement to the effect that the German Government would immediately draw up proposals for a solution of the Polish question which it would, if possible, place at the disposal of the British Government before the arrival of the Polish negotiator. 46. I had at once telegraphed to your Lordship the text of the German note( 5 ), and in the early hours of the morning of the 30th August (4 a.m.) I had already conveyed to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs your interim reply, to the effect that it would be carefully considered, but observing that it would be unreasonable to expect that His Majesty’s Government could produce a Polish representative at Berlin within twenty-four hours, and that the German Government must not count on this. 47. Later in the course of the day, I received three messages for communication to the German Government. The first was a personal one from the Prime Minister to the Chancellor notifying &gt;the latter of the representations made to Warsaw in regard to the avoidance of frontier incidents, and begging the German Government to take similar precautions. (I transmitted this in the afternoon to its destination in a personal letter to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.) The second similarly notified the German Government of our counsels of restraint to Poland and asked for reciprocation on Germany’s part. The third pointed out that the demand that a Polish Representative with full powers must come to Poland to receive the German proposals was unreasonable and suggested that the German Government should follow the normal procedure of inviting the Polish Ambassador to call and of handing him the German proposals for transmission to Warsaw with a view to arrangements being made for the conduct of negotiations. This last communication also reminded the German Government that it had promised to communicate its detailed proposals to His Majesty’s Government, who undertook, if they offered a reasonable basis, to do their best in Warsaw to facilitate negotiations. The good intentions of His Majesty’s Government were, in fact, patently clear and had Herr Hitler honestly desired or preferred a pacific settlement all the arrangements to that end seemed to be in full swing.O 5 ) Idem No. 89. 16 48. I had arranged to see the Minister for Foreign Affairs at 11-80 p.m. to make these communications to him. Shortly before the appointed time I received in code the considered reply of His Majesty’s Government to the German Note of the 29th August.(H ^ I was accordingly obliged to ask that my meeting with Herr von Ribbentrop should be postponed for half an hour, in order to give me the time to have this last message decyphered. 49. In the final passsages of that communication His Majesty’s Government, while fully recognising the need for speed in the initiation of discussions, urged that during the negotiations no aggressive military operations should take place on either side. They further expressed their confidence that they could secure such an undertaking from the Polish Government, if the German Government would give similar assurances. They also suggested a temporary modus vivendi at Danzig, such as would obviate the risk of incidents which might render German-Polish relations still more difficult. 50. I saw Herr von Ribbentrop at exactly midnight, before which hour the German Government had ostensibly counted on the arrival of a Polish emissary at Berlin. I say “ostensibly” since it seems hardly possible that it cannot have occurred to either Herr Hitler or his Minister for Foreign Affairs that it was utterly unreasonable to expect a Polish Plenipotentiary to present himself at Berlin without even knowing in advance the basis of the proposals about which he was expected to negotiate. It is conceivable that the Army Leaders had been representing to their Fiihrer that even 24 hours’ delay involved the risk of bad weather holding up the rapidity of the German advance into Poland, but, even so, it is^fN difficult not to draw the conclusion that the proposals in themselves were but dust to be thrown in the eyes of the world with a view to its deception and were never intended to be taken seriously by the German Government itself. 51. Be that as it may, it is probable that Herr Hitler’s mood in the hour when he had to decide between peace or war was not an amiable one. It was reflected in Herr von Ribbentrop, whose reception of me that evening was, from the outset, one of intense hostility, which increased in violence as I made each communication in turn. He kept leaping from his chair in a state of great excitement, and asking if I had anything more to say. I kept replying that I had, and, if my own attitude was no less unfriendly than his own, I cannot but say in all sincerity that I had every justification for it. When I told him that I would not fail to report his comments and remarks to my Government, he calmed down a little and said that they were his own, and that it was for Herr Hitler to decide. As for inviting the Polish Ambassador to come and see him, such a course would, he indignantly said, be utterly unthinkable and intolerable.52. After I had finished making my various communications to him, he produced a lengthy document which he read out to me in German, or rather gabbled through to me as fast as he could, in a tone of the utmost annoyance. Of the sixteen articles in it I was able to gather the gist of six or seven, but it would have been quite impossible to guarantee even the exact accuracy of these without a careful study of the text itself. When he had finished, I accordingly asked him to let me see it. Herr von Ribbentrop refused categorically, threw the document with a contemptuous gesture on the table and said that it was now out of date ( iiberholt ”), since no Polish Emissary had arrived at Berlin by midnight. 58. I observed that in that case the sentence in the German note of the 29th August to which I had drawn his and his Fiihrer’s attention on the preceding evening had, in fact, constituted an ultimatum in spite of their categorical denials. Herr von Ribben trop s answer to that was that the idea of an ultimatum was a figment of my own imagination and creation. 54. I do not desire to stress the unpleasant nature of this interview. The hour was a critical one and Herr von Ribbentrop’s excitability at such a moment was understandable. It seemed to me, however, that he was wilfully throwing away the last chance of a peaceful solution, and it was difficult to remain indifferent when faced with such a calamity. I would merely add that, contrary to what was subsequently published in the German press, I did not discuss a single detail of the German proposals with Herr von Ribbentrop, who flatly declined to do so. While it is true that they were read ho me, it was in such a manner as to make them practically unintelligible. 55. I returned to His Majesty’s Embassy that night with the feeling that the last hope for peace had vanished. I nevertheless saw the Polish Ambassador at 2 a.m., gave him a brief and studiously moderate account of my conversation with Herr von Ribbentrop, mentioned the cession of Danzig and the plebiscite in the Corridor as the two main points in the German proposals, stated that so far as I could gather they were not on the whole too unreasonable, and suggested to him that he might recommend to his Government that they should propose at once a meeting between Field-Marshals Smigly-Rydz and Goring. I felt obliged to add that I could not conceive of the success of any negotiations if they were conducted with Herr von Ribbentrop. 56. Though M. Lipski undertook to make this suggestion to his Government, it would by then probably have been in any case too late. There was, in fact, for Herr Hitler only one conceivable alter native to brute force, and that was that a Polish Plenipotentiary should humbly come to him, after the manner of Dr. Schuschnigg or President Hacha, and sign on the dotted line to the greater gloryof Adolf Hitler. And even that must happen at once. The Army was asking “ Yes ” or “ No,” since the success of its plans depended largely on the rapid occupation of Poland and the conclusion as soon as possible of the war on the Eastern front. Bad weather might ^ otherwise intervene at any time and was likely to prove one of Poland’s best defences against the highly mechanised German army. Moreover, a week had already been lost by Herr Hitler s hesitation on the 25th August. 57. I have no doubt that such and other considerations were present in Herr Hitler’s mind on the night of the 80th August. I was consequently not surprised when I received in the early hours of the morning of the 81st reliable information that the actual decision had been taken to order the advance of the German Army by midday or 1 p.m. if no Polish Plenipotentiary had arrived before then. I believe this information to have been accurate, and I attribute the further brief respite which ensued to the twelfth-hour efforts of the Italian Government to restrain Herr Hitler from war. 58. I had in the meantime obtained from another source more definite, if unauthorised, details of the German proposals, and these I at once communicated through the Counsellor of His Majesty s Embassy to the Polish Ambassador, who spent that morning on the telephone to Warsaw. About the middle of the day I had transmitted to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs a further message from His Majesty’s Government to the German Government notifying them that the Polish Government were taking steps to establish contact with them through the Polish Ambassador at Berlin, and asking them to agree to an immediate provisional modus vivendi at Danzig, for which^ purpose M. Burckhardt was suggested as intermediary. To this communication I never received any reply. There was, however, a further delay of some 12 hours. The Polish Government had authorised their Ambassador to establish contact with Herr von Kibbentrop, and Herr Hitler waited to see what message M. Lipski would bring. The question, in fact, was whether his qualifications would be those of a Plenipotentiary empowered by the Polish Govern ment to conduct and conclude negotiations or not. On no other terms was Hitler prepared to postpone action. His army was ready and Poland must be taught a lesson. She must crawl or get her whipping. 59. During the day there had been much activity on the part of Field-Marshal Goring. I think there can be no doubt that Field- Marshal Goring himself would have preferred a peaceful solution, but in matters such as these it was Herr Hitler’s decision which alone counted; and whatever Field-Marshal Goring himself might feel, he was merely the loyal and submissive servant of his master. Moreover, he had come down definitely on the side of peace a year before and it may have been difficult for him to adopt this course a second time. He invited me, however, to come and see him thatafternoon, and I did so at 5 p.m. in company of Sir G. Ogilvie- Forbes. Inasmuch as I had heard that the text of the proposals which Herr von Eibbentrop had refused to give me was to be announced that evening, my first remark was to point out to the Field-Marshal that this procedure would probably and finally wreck the last prospect of peace and to beg him to do his utmost to prevent their publication. Field-Marshal Goring’s reply was that he could not intervene, and that the German Government felt obliged to broadcast their proposals to the world in order to prove their ‘ ‘ good faith.” 60. Instead he talked for the best part of two hours of the iniquities of the Poles and about Herr Hitler’s and his own desire for friendship with England, and of the benefit to the world in general and the advantage to England in particular of such a friendship. It was a conversation which led nowhere and I could not help feeling that his remarks, which from his point of view were perfectly genuine but which I had heard often before, were chiefly intended for the edification of his listeners. I augured the worst from the fact that he was in a position at such a moment to give me so much of his time. He had a few days before been made president of the new German Defence Council for the Reich (or War Cabinet) and he could scarcely have afforded at such a moment to spare time in conversation if it did not mean that everything down to the last detail was now ready for action. 61. Incidentally the composition of that council was evidence of Herr Hitler’s acumen. He had selected for it all the most Respectable of the Nazi leaders, such as Herr Frick, Dr. Lammers, p&gt;r. Funk, who might be counted upon, with Field-Marshal Goring himself the most popular of them all with the general public, to inspire the confidence of the German people. The worst extremists and the most unpopular with the people were omitted from it. To them was to he confided the less enviable task of dealing with the neutrals, of organising the Interior and of ruthlessly repressing any internal discontent. My general impression of this last talk with Field-Marshal Goring was, in fact, that it constituted a final but forlorn effort on his part to detach Britain from the Poles. Nevertheless the Field-Marshal seemed sincere when, having been called to the telephone, he returned to tell us that M. Lipski was on his way to see Herr von Ribbentrop. He seemed to hope that, provided contact was only established, war might after all prove unnecessary. The meeting between the Polish Ambassador proved, however, quite futile. M. Lipski stated that he was acting solely in his capacity as an Ambassador without plenary powers to discuss or to negotiate, and handed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs a brief communication to the effect that the Polish Government were weighing favourably the proposal of His Majesty’s Government for direct discussion and that a formal answer in this matter would be communicated to the German Government in the immediate future.20 He did not ask for the German proposals and Herr von Ribbentrop did not offer to give them to him. Their meeting lasted but a ^ few minutes. 62. Early in the morning I had rung up the State Secretary f and, after pointing out that the German Government had promised to communicate these proposals to His Majesty’s Government, and how helpless I was without the authorised text of them, had asked him to suggest to Herr von Ribbentrop once more that they should be communicated to me. I heard no more from Baron von Weizsacker until late in the evening, when I received a message asking me to call upon him at 9'IS p.m. Similar messages had been sent to the French Ambassador and to the United States Charge d Affaires, giving them appointments for 9'30 and 9'45 respectively. I accordingly called on Baron von Weizsacker at the hour named and received from him the text of the proposals, together with an explanatory statement^ 7 ) As both these documents had already been broadcast at 9 p.m. I asked the Secretary of State what was the point now of making these communications to me. Baron von Weizsacker observed that he was merely carrying out his instructions and that he could make no further statement to me. I could only infer from this reply that Herr Hitler had taken his final decision. I accordingly drafted that night a telegram to your Lordship to the effect that it would be quite useless for me to make any further suggestions since they would now only be outstripped by events and that the only course remaining to us was to show our inflexible determination to resist force by force. 63. In point of fact the advance into Poland had been ordere^. that night, and in the early hours of the 1 st September without any declaration of war the German army crossed the frontier and the German Air Force proceeded to bomb the Polish aerodromes and lines of communications. 64. In accordance with Herr Hitler’s usual technique everything was done by the German authorities to prove to the German public that it was the Poles who had been the aggressors instead of the aggressed. Cynical notices were communicated at 6 a.m. to His Majesty’s Embassy notifying me that the Bay of Danzig was closed both to navigation and to flying in view of the possibility of military operations “ against hostile attacks by Polish naval forces or by Polish aircraft.” Field-Marshal Goring also sent me a message to say that the Poles had begun the war by blowing up the bridge across the Vistula at Dirchau, while Herr Hitler himself issued a proclama tion to the German army, declaring that the Polish State had refused the settlement which he offered and had appealed to arms, that the Germans in Poland were being persecuted by a bloody terror, and that the Poles were no longer willing to respect the frontier of the German Reich. Every German newspaper repeated the lie that it ( 7 ) Idem No. 98.21 was the Poles who had begun the fighting. Finally at 10 80 a.m. Herr Hitler met the Reichstag which had been summoned for that hour, and ^ similarly announced to the assembled Delegates that he had been “ forced to take up arms in defence of the Reich.” The die had in fact been cast and never can there have been or ever be a case of more deliberate and carefully planned aggression. 65. Late that evening I was instructed by your Lordship to notify the German Government that the latter by their action had created conditions which called for the implementation by the Govern ments of the United Kingdom and France of their undertaking to come to Poland’s assistance, and that, unless His Majesty’s Govern ment received satisfactory assurances that the German Government had suspended all aggressive action and would be prepared to with draw its forces from Polish territory, His Majesty’s Government would, without hesitation, fulfil their obligations to'Poland. I was instructed at the same time to request an immediate reply, and was authorised, if asked, to explain that this communication was in the nature of a warning, and was not to be considered as an ultimatum. 66 . I handed this communication in writing to the Minister for Foreign Affairs at 9-30 p.m. that evening. Herr von Ribbentrop received it without other comment than that the sole blame rested on the Poles, that it was they who had first mobilised and who had first invaded Germany with troops of the regular army. He made no enquiry as to the nature of the communication which he merely said that he must submit to the Ffihrer. I said that I realised that this would be necessary, and that I would be available at whatever ^iour he might be in a position to give me the Reichschancellor’s reply. The French Ambassador, who had been instructed to make a similar communication, did so immediately after me and received a reply on the same lines. 67. Earlier in the afternoon of that day, in accordance with your Lordship’s instructions, I had officially requested the United States Charge d’Affaires to be good enough to take charge of British interests in the event of war. All cyphers and confidential documents were burnt, and the whole of the Staff left their normal residences and were concentrated in the Adlon Hotel next door or in the Embassy itself. All the arrangements were carried out with a maximum of efficiency and a minimum of confusion, which did the utmost credit to the organisation and competency of the very excellent Staff of His Majesty’s Embassy. The chief responsibility for this rested upon Mr. Holman, as Head of the Chancery. 68 . The 2nd September was a day of suspense. The Poles were, it was reported, putting up a brave resistance in the face of surprise and overwhelming numbers, and in spite of the vast superiority of the German air force and mechanised forces. No reply was received from the German Government throughout the day to the British and French warnings.69. On the other hand, the Italian Government was making one more effort to save the situation. The Italian Ambassador had come to see me at midday on his way to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. Signor Attolico told me that he must know one thing immediately. 4r Was the communication which I had made the previous evening to Herr von Ribbentrop an ultimatum or not? I told his Excellency that I had been authorised to tell the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he had asked me—which he had not done—that it was not an ultimatum but a warning. I mentioned to Signor Attolico that I understood that the Italian Government had put forward a suggestion for the cessation of hostilities and the immediate summoning of a conference of the interested Powers. In this connection I said that I felt bound to express the opinion that such a proposal would never be entertained unless at the same time all the German troops were withdrawn from Polish territory. 70. The Ambassador retorted that I could not speak for my Government. I admitted that fact, but said that I could not imagine the possibility of ourselves, and much less of the Poles, agreeing to any lesser course. I do not know what reply, if any, was given by the German Government to this proposal. But I should like to put on record here that no one ever worked harder for peace than did Signor Attolico not only this year but last year also. He was entirely selfless in this his earnest endeavour. 71. There were, in fact, for Herr Hitler only two solutions : the use of force, or the achievement of his aims by the display of force. “ If you wish to obtain your objective by force, you must be strong; if you wish to obtain them by negotiation, you must be strongapk still.” That was a remark which he made to a foreign Statesman who visited him this year, and it expresses in the concisest possible form the Hitler technique. It was exactly that which he displayed in September 1988. He was no more bluffing then than he was bluffing in August 1989. Up to the middle of August this year the fear of a war on two fronts, with Russia hostile or at least unfriendly, might possibly have deterred him and his military advisers from action against Poland. There was no Eastern front to give him cause for hesitation in 1988, and he could have counted then on Hungarian as well as Polish support in his nefarious plans for the dismember ment of Czecho-Slovakia. But for Munich he would without a shadow of doubt have invaded that country on the 29th September last year, just as surely as he invaded Poland on the 1 st September this year, and the war would have come eleven months earlier. In both * cases the methods employed were identical: the gradual mobilisation of the German army over a period of months and its secret concentration at the appointed positions, whence the advance could begin at almost any moment and within a very few hours. 72. So it was again in 1989. If he could have secured his objectives by this display of force he might have been content for the moment, with all the additional prestige which another bloodlesssuccess would have procured for him with his own people. But it would only have been to start again once the world had recovered from the shock, and even his own people were beginning to be tired of these repeated crises. Millions of Germans had begun to long for a more peaceful existence. Guns instead of butter were becoming more and more unpopular except with the younger generation, and Hitler may well have wondered what might happen to his Nazi revolution if its momentum were allowed to stop. Moreover the financial and economic position of Germany was such that things could scarcely continue as they were without some form of explosion, internal or external. Of the two alternatives the most attractive from the point of view of his growing personal ambitions, and those of the clique which was nearest to him, was war. 78. It is scarcely credible that he would have acted as he did if bloody war, rather than a bloodless victory, had not seemed the fairer prospect for him. He had always meant to teach the Poles a lesson for what he regarded as their base ingratitude in refusing the “generous” demands which he had made to them in March. His only manoeuvres since that date were with the object of creating circumstances favourable to his plans or of inducing Britain and France to abandon their Polish ally and to leave him a free hand in Central and Eastern Europe. 74. To this end, encouraged by Herr von Ribbentrop, who apparently advised him up to the last moment that Britain would not fight, he worked unceasingly. In the course of one of the five interviews which I had with him during those last few days, I remarked to him that it was he who was ungenerous to the Poles, fcn view of the advantages which his treaty of 1934 with Pilsudski liad brought him. Herr Hitler denied that that treaty had ever been of any benefit to Germany and asserted that it had merely been unpopular with the Germans. It was a remark which was typical of Herr Hitler’s capacity to ignore everything which he might have said, promised or done in the past as soon as it had become contrary to views for the present or the future. 75. One of Herr Hitler’s greatest drawbacks is that, except for two official visits to Italy, he has never travelled abroad. For his knowledge of British mentality he consequently relied on Herr von Ribbentrop as an ex-Ambassador to Britain, who spoke both French and English, and who had spent some years in Canada, and whom he regarded as a man of the world. If report be true Herr von Ribbentrop gave him consistently false counsels in regard to England, while his successes in other spheres induced Herr Hitler to regard him more and more as a second Bismarck, a conviction which Herr von Ribbentrop probably shared to the full. 76. Even the most absolute Dictator is susceptible to the influence of his surroundings. Nevertheless Herr Hitler’s decisions, his calculations, and his opportunisms were his own. As Field-Marshal Goring once said to me, “ when a decision has to be taken, none of us count more than the stones on which we are standing. It is the Fiihrer alone who decides.” If anything did count, it was the opinion of his Military Advisers. I have always believed that it was they who, in the interests of Germany’s strategical security, recommended the establishment of the Protectorate over Bohemia. And again this August, it was they, I fancy, who told Herr Hitler that further delay would be fatal lest the seasonal bad weather in Poland might upset their calculations for her swift overthrow. The army grudged him even the week between the 25th August and the 1st September which his last attempt to secure British neutrality or at least goodwill had cost it. 77. Yet even so the advice of his soldiers was probably merely cover for the prosecution of Hitler’s own plans. His impatience and precipitate action on that last day of August can scarcely have been other than premeditated. All through the summer he had been waiting on events to turn in his favour and had been making his preparations to seize the opportunity, when it was offered to him. The Russian pact appeared to give him the advantage which he was seeking and thereafter there was no time to lose, if mud was not to be added to Poland’s allies. 78. When therefore the Polish Government delayed 48 hours in sending its Plenipotentiary to beg for terms at Berlin and even then sent only an Ambassador without plenary powers, Herr Hitler in spite of the expressed readiness of Poland to enter into direct negotiations, finally made up his mind not to keep his army waiting any longer. The order for the advance into Poland was‘probably given immediately after M. Lipski’s interview with Herr vod^ Ribbentrop at 6’30 p.m. on the 31st August. /d. Late in the afternoon of the 2 nd September I communicated to the Secretary of State for the information of the German Govern ment the verbatim report of the Prime Minister’s speech in the House of Commons on that date. Therein Mr. Chamberlain stated that while His Majesty’s Government could not agree to the proposal of the Italian Government for a conference while Poland was beinrr subjected to invasion, they would be willing, if the German forces were withdrawn from Polish territory, to regard the position as being the same as before the forces had crossed the frontier. It was the last chance of avoiding the great catastrophe of war at the last minute, but the German Government remained silent. 80 In the early hours (4 a.m.) of the 3rd September I was accordingly instructed by your Lordship to arrange for a meeting with the Minister for Foreign Affairs at 9 a.m. There was some difficulty in establishing contact with the Ministry at that hour, but I was finally informed that Dr. Schmidt was authorised bv the Minister to accept on his F.xcellency’s behalf any communication■- Q-i CLt *-j 25 1 , ?• it d il f e e 7 e e i s s t 3 1 r t 4 t which I might make to him. I accordingly handed to Dr. Schmidt at 9 a.m. precisely the final ultimatum from His Majesty’s Govern ment, pointing out that over 24 hours had elapsed since I had requested an immediate answer to our warning communication of the 1st September, that since then the attacks on Poland had been intensified, and that, unless satisfactory assurances were received by His Majesty’s Government before 11 a.m. British summer time of the suspension of all aggressive action against Poland and of the with drawal of the German forces from that country, a state of war would exist between our two countries as from that hour. 81. Dr. Schmidt received this communication and undertook to deliver it immediately to his Chief. As no reply from the German Government was vouchsafed by 11 a.m., the German Representative in London was informed in due course at that hour that a state of war existed between Britain and Germany. By 10 minutes past 11 a.m. every British consular officer in Germany had been advised by the staff of His Majesty’s Embassy at Berlin that this was the case. 82. Shortly after 11 a.m. I received a final message from Herr von Ribbentrop asking me to call upon him at once. I did so at 11-80 and he handed me this time a lengthy document to read, beginning with a refusal on the part of the German people to accept any demands in the nature of an ultimatum made by the British Government, and stating that any aggressive action by England would be answered with the same weapons and the same form. The rest of the document was pure propaganda with a view to attempting to prove to the German people and the world generally that it was f Britain alone who was to blame for everything which had happened. [y only comment on reading this completely false representation of events was : “It would be left to history to judge where the blame really lay.” Herr von Ribbentrop’s answer was to the effect that history had already proved the facts, and that nobody had striven harder for peace and good relations with England than Herr Hitler himself. His last remark to me was that he wished me personally good, to which I could only reply that I deeply regretted the failure of all my efforts for peace, but that I bore no grudge against the German people. Thereafter I saw no further German official except the member of the Protocol, who accompanied our special train as far as Rotterdam. My last official communication to the German Government was a note which I presented on the instructions of His Majesty’s Government enquiring whether the German Govprnment would observe the provisions of the Geneva Protocol of 1925 pro hibiting the use in war of asphyxiating, poisonous or other gases and of bacteriological methods of warfare I understand that the German Government have since replied through the Swiss Minister in London giving the required assurance on the understanding that His Majesty’s Government would similarly observe the provisions of the Protocol.26 83. The French Ambassador had presented at noon a similar ultimatum to the German Government to expire at 5 p.m. For a few hours after 11 a.m. the telephonic lines of His Majesty’s Embassy ^ at Berlin continued to function, but about 4 p.m. all telephonic lines were cut off and both the Staff at the Adlon Hotel and the Embassy ^ 1 itself was isolated from all external contact. Members of my staff, however, had visited the Protocol at 11 a.m. with a view to arranging for our departure. They were treated with every civility and con sideration and were informed that a special train would be placed at our disposal the following morning. 84. Our only contact thereafter with the outside world was through the American Embassy. Its aid and help was invaluable. No trouble was too great for the Charge d’Affaires, Mr. Alexander Kirk, and the members of his staff. They did everything that was possible to smooth over the difficulties of those last 24 hours, and our pleasantest recollection of them is our appreciation of the great sympathy and willing assistance which we received from the American Embassy. 85. The French Embassy left Berlin at 9 a.m. the following morning, Monday, the 4th September. The British Embassy followed in a special train, leaving the Charlottenberg station at 11*20 a.m. The whole party consisted of 30 men, 7 women and 2 dogs. A small crowd collected round the Embassy before our departure, but unlike 1914 it evinced no single sign of hostility. Mr. Kirk rendered me one more last service by driving me to the station in his own car. The streets of Berlin were practically deserted and there was nothing to indicate the beginning of a war which is to decide whether force is to be the sole arbiter in int^P^ national affairs; whether international instruments solemnly and freely entered into are to be modified, not by negotiation, but by mere unilateral repudiation; whether there is to be any faith in futuie in written contracts; whether the fate of a great nation and the peace of the world is to rest in the future in the hands of one man; whether small nations are to have any rights against the pretensions of States more powerful than themselves; in a word, whether government of the people by the people for the people is to continue in this world, or whether it is to be replaced by the arbitrary will and ambition of single individuals regardless of the peoples’ will. 86 . Our journey through Germany, if prolonged, was uneventful. At the various stations at which we stopped there was some curiosity but no evidence of hostility. We reached Rheine, a small station some 20 kilom. from the German frontier, at about 6 p.m. on the Monday evening. There our train was detained for nearly twenty hours pending the safe arrival in Dutch territorial waters of the German mission from London. We eventually left Rheine at 1-30 p.m. on Tuesday and were received with great hospitality at r27 the Dutch frontier. We reached Rotterdam that evening, and after spending a night at The Hague and one on board the Dutch steamer Batavier V, left Rotterdam in the early hours of Thursday morning, the 6 th September. We arrived at Gravesend about 6 p.m. that evening. 1 I have, &amp;c. NEVILE HENDERSON.Telegram From India Office, London.

Introduction. Before the war and ever since its outbreak the German Govern ment have almost daily put out propaganda accusing Great Britain of atrocities in South Africa forty years ago. A press message from Durban of the 27th September, 1939, states :— “ The Nazis now employ a woman announcer who tells grim stories of alleged atrocities committed by the British in the Boer War. Afrikaaners are urged to revolt and are pathetically asked whether they intend to submit to the rule of those who put powdered glass in the food of their children in concentration camps during the Boer War. Many other outrageous falsehoods are told in an effort to stir up passions. Fantastic stories are also circulated of brutal treatment of Germans by the Allies in the ^ present war.” In view of this shameless propaganda, which is wholly devoid of any foundation, His Majesty’s Government think it ^opportune to publish some of the reports they have received -of the treatment accorded in Germany itself to German nationals. In'1933 members of the opposition parties were arrested wholesale and consigned to concentration camps where they w T ere subjected to the most barbarous treatment. Flogging and torture were the order of the day, and it was common knowledge in Germany that the National Socialist movement w r as taking terrible vengeance on those who had the temerity to oppose it. During this period the violence and brutality of the Nazis did not spare foreigners. His Majesty’s Ambassador at Berlin, in a despatch of the 29th November, 1933, reported that he had learnt from the Czecho-Slovak Legation that since the advent of the new regime there had been 344 cases of attacks on or arrests of Czecho-Slovak citizens. British subjects, including a member of the staff of His Majesty’s Embassy, were wantonly assaulted in the streets by uniformed S.A. men on duty. Other victims of the S.A. included a foreign Consul-General, who was severely injured by a number of uniformed men who left a marching column in order to attack him. The attitude then adopted by the German Government was that U^y regretted and would put an end to excesses against foreigners, regarded them as unavoidable in the first ardour of revolutionary fervour. [20079] o*4 This plea cannot be put forward to excuse events which occurred five years after the advent to power of the National Socialist party. It is evident from the published documents, which cover only the period from 1988 onwards, that neither the consolidation of the regime nor the passage of time have in any way mitigated its savagery. These documents were not written for publication, and, indeed, so long as there was the slightest prospect of reaching any settlement with the German Government it would have been wrong to do ^ anything to embitter relations between the two countries. Even after the outbreak of war His Majesty’s Government felt reluctant to take action which might have the effect of inspiring hatred. But the attitude of the German Government and the unscrupulous propaganda which they are spreading compels His Majesty’s Government to publish these documents so that public opinion both here and abroad may be able to judge for itself. The German Government has complained of the maltreatment of German minorities in foreign countries and of the “Macedonian conditions” reigning there. It will be seen from the published papers that under the present regime the conditions in Germany itself and the treatment accorded to Germans are reminiscent not of Macedonia but of the darkest ages in the history of man. n imi—5 No. 1 . Sir N. Henderson to Viscount Halifax. My Lord, Berlin, March 3, 1938. I have the honour to inform you that according to an official communique of the 3rd March judgment in the trial of Dr. Martin Niemoller, which began on the 7 th February, was delivered on the 2nd March. Dr. Niemoller has been sentenced to seven months’ confinement in a fortress (“ Festungshaft ”), and fines totalling 2,000 reichsmarks for endangering the peace, misuse of the pulpit and incitement to disregard the laws of the German Government. Non-payment of the fine will entail a further term of imprisonment of three months. 2. This is the only mention of the case which has yet appeared in the press, and all persons who have been present at the trial have been placed under an oath of secrecy. 3. In the ordinary way Dr. Niemoller would have been released on payment of the fine; but I learn that Dr. Niemoller was taken into protective custody by the secret police primarily because he had made it clear during his trial that he intended to continue his activities. It was feared, therefore, that he would lay himself open -^to a new charge, similar to the last, within a short time. 4. I am informed that Dr. Niemoller has not been transferred to a concentration camp but is being detained for the present in a Berlin prison. I have, &amp;c. NEVILE HENDERSON. No. 2 . Sir N. Henderson to Viscount Halifaa:. (Telegraphic.) Berlin, March 7, 1938. There is an uneasy feeling in the air here, and every kind of rumour is circulating in Berlin, such as that General von Fritsch has been shot, that mass-arrests have been made, that a big political trial is impending, &amp;c. I have no confirmation of any of these rumours and have no reason to believe in their truth except in so far as it is a fact that Herr Hitler is in a highly nervous and excitable state. I gathered the impression during my conversation with him on the 3rd March that he was dissatisfied with result of Niemoller trial. The man, he declared, was a traitor and those who sympathised with him 4 Bpuld accordingly find themselves in a concentration camp. -England, he added angrily, could not criticise for it was Englishmen who had invented concentration camps. Niemoller enjoys much [20079] o* 26 sympathy in many quarters and officers in uniform have attended services for him. It is possible that there have been arrests of persons known to be his supporters. No. 3. Sir N. Henderson to Viscount Halifax. Dear Secretary of State, Berlin, May 25, 1938. I have received a letter on the Church question, in which the writer asks that you should be apprised of her views. As the letter is of some interest as reflecting the attitude of many German parents, I am enclosing a translation in case you have time to look at it when these alarums are over. Yours ever, NEVILE HENDERSON. Enclosure in No. 3. (Translation.) _ Your Excellency, May 21, 1938. ^ In the following letter I am undertaking something which I myself feel to be a very difficult task :— 1. I appeal to a foreign Power for help in a matter which is the private concern of the German people. 2 . I write without mentioning my name. Anonymous letters should by rights be consigned to the waste- paper basket, but since you are aware of the state of affairs in Germany as regards the censorship of letters, moral compulsion, concentration camps, and so on, I hope that you will lend a willing ear to this appeal in spite of its anonymity. The object of my petition is that England, the country which is still the strongest in Europe, and which is trying to preserve its Christian character, will make all future negotiations with Germany conditional upon the cessation of hostility towards Christianity in Germany. The first condition upon which the end of this conflict depends would be the release of our imprisoned pastors, especially the pastor Martin Niemoller, whose lot must be a source of the greatest bitterness to all fair-minded people. But almost more important still, it seems to me, is the demand that the systematic alienation of our youth from Christ shall be stopped. We parents must surrender our 10-year-old children to the contr^ 1 * of the Hitler Youth, the League of German Girls, and later on the Cabour Service. Our exceptionally gifted boys must attend the AdolfHitler Schools and afterwards pass on to the National Socialist Schools of Political Training (“ Ordensburgen ”), there to be prepared for future leadership in the State and the party. In all these institutions a great deal that is excellent, and which we parents welcome with joy and gratitude, is offered to youth. But they one and all serve as w T ell to exert upon our youth an influence hostile to Christianity! Perhaps it niay be possible to forward this letter, which expresses every i Christian mother’s way of thinking, despite its anonymity to your revered Queen. She, as a Christian and a mother, will understand our anxiety for our children. It is not, however, quite correct to say, as I have done above, that the question at issue is the private concern of the German people; for, if in the heart of Europe a rising generation is brought up not only in indifference to Christianity but all too often in hatred of it, the future will be fraught with disaster not only for Germany but for Europe. At the present time the ancient Christian traditions of grandparents and parents have a restraining influence still—but woe to Germany, and woe to Europe, when these traditions shall have passed away! Your Excellency, many German mothers would be grateful to you from the bottom of their hearts if you could bring these lines to the ^notice of your Foreign Minister, Lord Halifax, who has been brought up in the spirit of Christianity, and, if at all possible, of your Christian Royal couple as well. We hope for England’s help in our hard fight against the forces hostile to Christianity which are threatening our pastors and our youth. A German Mother, WHO IS OF ONE MIND WITH VERY many Christian parents. ' i No. 4. Consul-General Gainer to Viscount Halifax. His Majesty s Consul-General at Vienna presents his compliments to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and has the^ honour to transmit to him a copy of his despatch to His Majesty s Ambassador, Berlin, dated the 10 th October, respecting the Catholic and anti-Catholic demonstrations in Vienna.8 Enclosure in No. 4. Consul-General Gainer to Sir N. Henderson. gj r Vienna, October 10, 1988. I have the honour to report that a sermon was preached on Friday evening, the 7th instant, in the Cathedral Church of St. Stephen in Vienna by Cardinal Archbishop Innitzer. After the sermon a large group of young persons demonstrated outside the cardinal’s palace shouting “ Heil, Christus! ” “ Heil, Innitzer!” The cardinal appeared several times upon the balcony of the palace and received the greetings of the demonstrators. 2. This is the first occasion since the Anschluss that any kind of public Catholic demonstration has taken place in Vienna, and, as was to be anticipated, a counter-demonstration was promptly organised. This counter-demonstration, however, assumed so violent an aspect that a very serious situation has resulted. 8 . On Saturday evening, the 8 th instant, at about 7'SO r.M., groups of young men belonging to the S.A. and H.J., but not in party uniform, began to arrive in the Stephansplatz in parties of five, armed with ladders and bludgeons. The ladders were planted against^ the cardinal’s palace and the lads entered the first floor of the building' after smashing in all the windows. Once inside, they destroyed every religious picture to be seen, leaving other pictures untouched, smashed the busts of several Popes, stole valuable chalices and three episcopal rings, and collected the robes, and even the personal wardrobe, of the cardinal, which they threw into the courtyard with several articles of furniture and set fire to them. The cardinal fled to an attic, protected by his servants, and remained undiscovered. A priest of the cardinal’s household who endeavoured to restrain the attackers was mishandled and an attempt was made to throw him out of a window. He was badly cut about the hands and arms by broken glass. A similar attack was made upon the residence and officers of the dean of the cathedral, and a priest there was actually thrown out of the window and both his legs were broken. 4. The police were telephoned for seven times from the palace and arrived three-quarters of an hour after the first telephone call. On their arrival, the leader of the mob blew a whistle, the attackers formed a column and marched off the square in procession, unmolested and uridetained by the police, whose efforts were confined to controlling an angry crowd which had gathered. The fire brigade was summoned to put out the bonfire and an ambulance was sent to collect the injured priests and members of the cardinal’s household. The S.A. are to-day in occupation of the palace, where the cardinal remains, and no one is allowed to enter. The leader of the assault was a 16-year-old boy. ^ 5. The above facts were given to me by a priest who to-day visited the deanery and took stock of the damage done.6 . It is reported that the Papal Nuncio arrived at Vienna from Berlin yesterday to enquire into the matter, but has not been given access to the cardinal. 7. A meeting of all the parish priests in Vienna has been summoned for 5 o’clock this afternoon, and it is expected that instruc tions will be given to read a letter of protest in all the parish churches next Sunday. 8 . Strong protests have been made to Gauleiter Biirckel, who has conveyed his regrets to the cardinal and has promised that energetic action will be taken against those responsible, but this will merely lead to further difficulties for Herr Biirckel with the local party organisations. I have, &amp;c. D. St. CLAIR GAINER. No. 5. Statements communicated to the F'oreign Office on October 28, 1988, by a Charity Organisation working in Germany. (a) Statement by Jewish ex-Prisoner; August 1988. (Translation.) Herr X, a well to do Jewish business man, was for six weeks in the concentration camp at Buchenwald. In order to preserve a semblance of legality, police records are searched through and the slightest bad mark against a Jew, sometimes a trifling offence of forty years ago, is made the excuse for the arrest. Herr X said that the working hours were sixteen per day, Sundays and week-days alike. During these hours it was forbidden to drink, even in the hottest weather. The food in itself was not bad, but quite insufficient. Weak coffee at dawn and a half litre of soup at midday; bread allowance for the whole day 250 gramms. (Men who had any money could sometimes buy condensed milk, &amp;c., from the canteen.) While he was there the work of Jewish prisoners was doubled, and their rations halved. The work, of course, consists in moving heavy stones, often far beyond the strength of even a normal well-fed man. The Jews were sneeringly told by their guards that they were only experiencing the same treatment as their forefathers in Egypt, and that Pharoah had not gone half far enough. The men were kept standing at attention for many hours on end. Floggings were very frequent, for such small offences as drinking water during working hours. The usual punishment was twenty-five strokes given alternately by two guards. This often ^pduced unconsciousness, but the Jews were told that the Fiihrer nad himself given orders that the Jews might receive up to sixty strokes. [20079] c* 410 Herr X was in a group of 480 men who had only one tap at which to wash and drink for a quarter of an hour on getting up. Later even this was stopped. During the six weeks he was in the camp Herr X saw neither soap nor tooth-brush. There were about 8,000 men in the camp when he was there, but it was rumoured that the number was shortly to he increased to 20,000. There were 1,500 Jews and 800 Ernste Bibelforscher (International Bible Students). The rest were politicals, so-called criminals and gypsies. Each man wore a badge—Jews yellow with the star of David, Bible Students violet, &amp;c. The Communists and others who were prisoners of long standing, acted as sub “ warders.” Jewish prisoners wrote and received letters twice a month. The Bible Students were allowed no communication with the outside world, but on the other hand, their rations were not cut down. Herr X spoke with the highest respect of these men. Their courage and religious faith were remarkable, and they professed themselves ready to suffer to the uttermost what they felt God had ordained for them. Deaths took place daily in the camp. (Their relatives were often first informed of this by &amp; call from an official who said they_ could have the ashes on payment of 8 marks.) Herr X—a man in the sixties—had a complete collapse after his release, and was three jp. weeks in bed. Another man was taken to the City Hospital with ^ such high fever that he was not expected to live, and another, released at the same time, was in such a state of nerves that he could not cross a road. Herr X made the statement, which was fully confirmed on enquiry, that no Jewish prisoner is ever released unless he can produce evidence that he is able to leave Germany. There appears to be no release from this system of deliberate torture of mind and body but death. Herr X entreats that some way may be found by which these men could be released en bloc and placed in some kind of humane concentration camp in another country while their ultimate destination and fate was being decided. He realises that such a proposal is quite beyond the scope of any private Refugee Committees, and needs international planning, but he begs that it may at least receive careful and sympathetic consideration. (b) Statement by a Jewish-Christian Prisoner. (Translation.) Herr Z had a small business in Germany (with three employees). Arrested in June 1838 in a “round-up” in the streets of Berlin without any cause or pretext. No order of arrest (and later no papers of discharge). Brought to the Alexander Place prison ; put in where there were thirty-two men, too small for it to be possible to lie down. Took it in turns to sit down during the night. One bucketfor sanitary purposes. (Awful stench.) Stayed two days there. Previously in the police quarters everyone had been asked for their life history, and forced to sign their approval of being put into “ protective custody.” All belongings taken away. About 8,000 prisoners collected from fifteen different police quarters. Transporta tion in lorries to station, and put in special trains with no mention of the final destination. Prohibition to talk. Arrived 6-30 a.m. at Weimar. Reception by S.S. men with insults and blows: ” Jew- dogs, blackguards, now we have got you! ” Ac. Some 8-4 per cent. Aryans and a few gypsies. Taken away in lorries under Camp Commandant Schneider. One-and-a-half hours to Buchenwald. Awful condition of camp. Filth and mud up to the knees in places. Many trees had been cut down but stumps left. Almost impossible to walk. A man with heart trouble who cannot walk is dragged along by the feet by other prisoners (S.S. men do not touch Jews). The flesh is torn from his face. He is so disfigured as to be unrecognisable. (Other examples similar to this.) Three hundred and fifty of the new arrivals lodged in the basement of the barracks. (In the whole camp there were about 10,000 men, 100 straw sacks and no other furnishings.) Three men to each straw sack in four rows. Obliged to lie on our sides; and crosswise over sack so as ^ to make room ; packed like sardines; lying on the back forbidden or blows given with a club (“ Knuppel ”). The men directly in charge are older prisoners. The ‘‘Black Superiors,” themselves ‘‘pro fessional criminals,” sleep with us. Their word is absolute law. On our arrival a roll-call lasting for hours with address by the commandant, who has given all instructions for our ‘‘reception.” Camp-orders: this is no prison or place of correction; here there are other methods. Any attempt at escape or attack (mere talking or gesticulation can be taken as such) is stopped by the 1 , 000 -volt charged wire. Every sentry is to use his rifle without warning if anyone moves in his direction. Every bullet costs 12 pfennigs, and that is just what a Jew is worth, neither more nor less. All this interlarded with words of abuse—‘‘Jewish swine,” ‘‘the Chosen People, God’s People, Jewish muck, dirty swine,” &amp;c. (but after a few days one gets used to it). The commandant’s representative calls the roll and appoints the officers. The first days are occupied with roll-calls, clothes distribution (military boots, trousers and coat, but no underclothing). The things are worn over the naked bodv! Everyone shivers with cold. Buchenwald lies high. After ten days we get underclothes. Time-table: 3*30 a.m., get up (bed about 10 p.m.), very bad air- smell appalling; water drips down the tiny cellar windows. Form ranks at 4-30. Coffee distribution at 4-45 on the square where the gallows stand and the blocks (for flogging). Before the time of this report, the body of the murderer of an S.S. man hung there. The Kingman is a professional criminal who has now become a veteran.” Ordinary German salute strictly forbidden in the camp. The salute means standing to attention with the cap off, while12 commands are repeated. 5 - 80 a.m., end of roU-call; until then stand stiffly to attention. Those who have reported sick now come forward, are separated off and inspected by the commandant. He at once treats the “ fit ” with his riding whip, in their face, in the presence of the others; “Jews do not fall ill.” The commandant decides by sight who is “ripe” for the doctor. These number fi or 7 per cent.; the others have to go back into the labour gang. No differentiation of the sick in the labour gang; they are helped on bv kicks and riding whip. The doctor declares the sick as either “ ill ” or “ fit “; in the latter case they are punished in the evening for “ lies.” In the end no Jews were accepted as sick; there could only be “ well or dead.” In the roll-call many are unable to continue standing; they have to be forcibly held up by their companions in misfortune, so that they can be seen from the front, even those who are completely collapsed; the ranks must be complete. The work consists of stone-breaking a quarter of an hour away from the road which is to be built. It is outside the camp, but within the charged wires. Attempts at flight occur, but all end with shooting. Many end their sufferings by feigning flight in order to be shot down. Everywhere sentries are posted around. A colony of “cripples,” men with wooden legs, ruptures (sometimes if their belts are lost the ruptures break out again), are obliged to carry ^ massive stones at the will of the guard. They included old men C over 70 who were utterly unequal to the work. In one instance a guard prodded with his bayonet a man who was ill and who kept on collapsing. After this had happened repeatedly, the man rushed to the wire to put an end to himself, and was shot down. The quarter of an hour’s stretch to the road is done twelve to fifteen times in the morning and eight times in the afternoon by those who are really able to work; the “ cripples ” do half this. Every four men of the former have to deal with a barrow loaded up with great boulders, and often have to do it running. Woe to anyone who trips! Anyone who is unfit gets blows from the club by the overseer, and after him the guards with the butts of their rifles follow suit. All parties are thorough in their inflicting of punishment for fear of their own superiors. Any drinking of water is expressly forbidden. For false reporting of being sick, for “lies,” or being “work shy” the penalty is the whip. At 11-30 comes the midday pause (although sometimes work is enforced till 7 o’clock without food). 12-80, work resumed till 3-30. 4 p.m., roll-call. This generally lasts till 5-80; for many of the “Jew people” till 10. How “ Non-Aryans ” are distinguished from Jews is not clear. Woe to the non-Aryan who by mistake gets among the Aryans. Jews have to wear the “ David Cross ” with the sign : red for “ professional criminal,” black for the “ work shy,” lilac for the “ Bible bug.” One is compelled to sign oneself as a “ professional criminal,” and it goes on the card index. (On the other side of the card one’s real profession is stated.) W#* to him who refuses to sign the statement ! Yellow is the sign for a Jew and has to be added to the other.IB The floggings take place at the afternoon roll-call, the individuals having to step forward. The penalties are read out (being fixed beforehand). Normal punishment is twenty-five strokes on the seat, carried out by two guards standing on each side with riding whips. The prisoner is lashed to a board. If he cries out the strokes are increased up to thirty-five. The guards use all their force, sometimes springing into the air so as to bring the arm down with increased momentum. Few days pass without cases of flogging, and the number may be from two to ten. After the flogging the men have to stand to attention with face to the wall to the end of the roll-call. Then the sanitary officer comes round and puts ointment on the wounds. The other punishment is hanging up 8 metres from the ground by the arms, which are violently bent back for the purpose. This is done by express orders from tiie commandant given through a microphone. Special men are employed to carry out these punish ments and they do nothing else. The hanging lasts for ten to twelve hours and is in public. Another form of it is to have the arms round the trunk of the tree with wrists handcuffed. The feet are off the ground, but it is regarded as milder punishment and the S.S. men can inflict it at any time. In the evening there is no sort of free time but things are easier. *There may be examinations by the State Police but no mishandling; once in fourteen days a letter home, if it has not been forbidden. But, of course, it is impossible to say anything about the real circum stances and the families know nothing of it. Herr Z. was only in the camp fourteen days, but he gives the following individual instances happening in this short period : A man who had been condemned to stand with his eyes to the wall, at the end of three hours or so—as is inevitable—began to droop slightly thinking he was unobserved. But a rigid position is demanded all the time. A guard saw that the prisoner was not standing properly. He seized the prisoner and beat his head repeatedly against the stone wall (the stones were rough with sharp edges). The blood gushed out and streamed down the wall. Then renewed fury seized the guard: “You swine to make that mess on the wall!” Now he threw him on the ground and beat him mercilessly. Herr Z. thought the man would surely be dead, but he survived. An even worse case was that of a middle-aged man who received an affectionate letter from his wife. He was an educated man of a sensitive type and unable always to maintain the degree of self- control and outward hardness which is demanded. He gave way to a moan. For this he was tied up to a tree and left fourteen hours. He became unconscious. Two guards passed : “ Ahah! he is already dead!” They loose him and throw his body on the ground. Then they jump on to his body and stamp on him in their heavy boots. moves slightly, “Ahah! he is -not quite dead!” Herr Z. had to pass on, but next time he saw the man his breast and face were a mass of clotted blood, his eyes swollen and purple. Moreover, he14 had gone mad. At the roll call he had to be helped up by a man on each side. But his head hung forward and he made spasmodic convulsive movements. At night he suddenly started up screaming wildly, and tried to run away over the bodies of the men lying packed together. The order was then given that in future the two men lying next to him at night were to be responsible for his keeping quiet, and if he screamed again they would themselves get twenty-five lashes. The S.S. men employed in the camp were mostly very young men of 17 to 20 who had been specially “ trained ” for the purpose. But they were already so brutalised and sadistic that it was a constant wonder to Herr Z. how it could have been brought about (and what would their mothers think?). They seemed to revel in inflicting torture. One instance of it was the tickling of a prisoner’s face with a straw, and then when the face twitched giving him a terrific blow. The sadistic amusements of the guard shows itself, e.g., in their treatment of an old man, a lawyer by profession, whose Jewish features were rather specially marked. He was made to stand like a statue on the top of a w r all for six to eight hours on end as a “ monument.” All the passers by laughed heartily at this good joke. On another occasion a guard asked him whether he was feeling the heat, and when the lawyer assented, ten buckets of water w^ere poured over his head. Herr Z. himself fared relatively well in the camp. He attributes this to prayer by which he was able to overcome ^ fear. It requires much physical strength and nerve pow-er to carry out briskly all the exorbitant demands that are made upon one, and to get through the heavy labour and other physical ordeals without faltering or flinching. Signs of weakness evidently excite f he sadistic instincts of the guards. Thus when a man was on the ground at their feet they would habitually kick him in the face. Herr Z. used to pray and beseech God to let the victims die, as one bout of torture simply led on to another one. It would have been so much simpler and more merciful to shoot them than to allow a life, which for all practical purposes had already been destroyed, to drag on to the prolonged infinite agony of the victim. The camp held 10,000 prisoners, about half of them Jews (and some ” Bible Seekers”). There were many deaths daily. Herr Z. was only fourteen days in the camp. He was one of a small number who were released because all arrangements were ready for their emigration. For any prisoner, however, who bore scars release was impossible. They wore strictly threatened that if a word was said as to what they had seen or experienced in the camp they would immediately be put back. Herr Z. had asked leave to stay a few weeks before leaving the country in order to finish selling his possessions. It was made clear to him, however, that he would be rearrested. A German pastor pleaded his case with the English Consul at the port and Herr received his visa to leave the country at once. The sale of his e. had paid for his ticket to South America. But his business had to15 be closed down and the 100 per cent, tax on all possessions bought since 1988 prevented him taking away most of his belongings (expensive professional instruments, &amp;c.). lie finally came away with just 10 marks in cash. Herr Z. had fought through the war. But life in the trenches compared to that in a concentration camp, was a “ sanatorium.” No. 6 . Consul-General Gainer to Viscount Halifax. His Majesty’s Consul-General at Vienna presents his compli ments to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and has the honour to transmit to him a copy of his despatch to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, Berlin, dated the 11 th November, 1988, respecting the anti-Jewish demonstrations in Austria following the death of Herr vom Rath, secretary of the German Embassy at Paris. Vienna, November 11 , 1938. Enclosure in No. 6 . Consul-General Gainer to Sir G. Ogilvie-Forbes. Sir, Vienna, November 11 , 1938. I have the honour to report that the anti-Jewish demonstrations in Vienna, the occasion of which was the murder of Herr vom Rath, secretary to the German Embassy in Paris, assumed very alarming proportions on the night of the 9th instant and during the whole of the 10 th instant. 2 . The action was undertaken by the Austrian S.A., most of whom were in full uniform, and the police had obviously received instructions not to intervene. A very large number of shops and houses owned or occupied by Jews were wrecked and numerous arrests took place. Yesterday morning Jewish prayer houses and synagogues were set on fire in considerable numbers; the Volkischer Beobachter, indeed, gives particulars of no less than nineteen synagogues which were completely destroyed by fire. Another in the Leopoldgasse was destroyed by a bomb, which did considerable damage to near-lying buildings. All the fire brigades of Vienna were fully employed, as at one time there seemed to be grave danger of a serious and wide spread conflagration involving large sections of tbe city. 3. The press openly rejoices at these manifestations and con gratulates the people on the fact that the Jews ‘‘can now no longer hatch plots against the State under cover of religious services.” ^ 4. In addition to this orgy of destruction, all Jewish shops were forced to close and may not yet reopen. In many cases plate-glass16 and other windows were broken and the shops were openly looted by the mob. Gauleiter Biirckel endeavoured to give some appearance of legality to this anti-Jewish action by issuing instructions that houses occupied by Jews should be searched for weapons and illegal literature. In the course of the search numerous arrests were made. 5. The immediate consequence of these demonstrations was that hundreds of Jews formed even larger queues than usual outside this consulate-general and that of the United States. On the 9 th instant already at 6-80 p.m. a large number of Jews lined up outside this consulate-general prepared to wait all night until the Passport Office opened the next morning. They were dispersed by the police that evening and three times again before 8-80 a.m. on the 10 th and every Jewish man was taken into arrest, only the women and children being left. At the United States Consulate-General the S.A. began beating the crowds with rope-ends until the United States Consul- General, unable to bear the spectacle, insisted on police intervention, which was eventually granted. 6 . The Vienna correspondent of The Times was arrested by the S.A. as he was taking notes of the demonstrations in the Leopold- gasse and was taken to the police station. On revealing his identity to the police, he received an apology and was allowed to go. Ten minutes later he was again arrested and again released. He informed me that on his arrival at the police station he observed a ^ number of Jews cowering in corners, so terrified that they were * unable even to remember their names, while an old Jew with white hair and beard was lying on the floor being brutally kicked by an S.A. man while the regular police looked on. 7. This morning the public manifestations have ceased, but arrests continue to be made. The Jewish population is terrified and I am besieged with applications for help and by persons wishing to relate their experiences.^ I fear that several British subjects have suffered damage, and individual reports on these cases will be transmitted as soon as full particulars are available. 8 . Last night Vienna presented an extraordinary spectacle, with fires raging all over the city and Jews were being hustled along the streets, cursed at and assaulted by crowds of hooligans whose pride il is to belong to one of the greatest and most civilised nations of the world. 9. The anti-Jewish demonstrations were not confined to Vienna. Thus a synagogue at Linz was burnt to the ground; the synagogue at Salzburg was wrecked and its contents thrown into the street; Jewish shops were also looted. At Hallein and at Bad Gastein the Jewish hotels and pensions were sacked, including the Hotel Bristol, the Kurhaus Cacilia, a further Kurhaus and a large villa owned by a Jew. I have, &amp;c. D. St. CLAIR GAINER. rNo. 7. Consul-General Bell to Sir G. Ogilvie-Forbes (Berlin). British Consulate-General, Sir, Cologne, November 14, 1988. With reference to my telegram of the 11 th instant, reporting anti-Jewish manifestations in Cologne, I have the honour to state that additional reports indicate these to have been very thorough and systematic throughout my consular district. In Cologne itself, there have been suicides of German Jews actually known to me, though this unfortunately is nothing new in my experience. Four hundred Jews have been taken into “preventive arrest” ostensibly for their own protection. I hear, however, that they are unlikely to be set free until they have been financially bled. The Jewish synagogue in Cologne has been damaged by fire, and it is said that the local fire brigade took no action save to prevent the spread of the flames lo neighbouring houses. The Jews are in a desperate plight. The offices of the consulate-general have been overrun with them, and though I do the best I can with a small staff it is frequently necessary to close the doors to the public to enable us to attend to those already in the office. One German Jewess pestered a member of the staff to ^take her husband into his small flat over the night of the 11 th. The man actually arrived at the door with his pyjamas. There is nervous ness amongst middle-class Germans, who in general disapprove. They dare not, however, voice their disapproval. One German woman who voiced her disapproval in a tram car which runs past my house was arrested at the first stop by Nazi guards. The industrialists say that they have no influence with the party, who have made such a point of racial purity that the Fiihrer must carry his theories to their logical conclusion. Everyone agrees, however, that last week’s events have considerably complicated international relations. Personally, I have been more shocked by the coldblooded and calculated manner in which action was taken than by anything else about the recent events. Yet I am inclined to think that the Fiihrer knows his Germans. Amongst the masses of Germans who have nothing at stake there is observable a certain amount of Schadenfreude (“Joy in Mischief”). Our German cook, for instance, observed to me n few days ago that it was high time a certain neighbouring Jew was “ washed up.” In short, an abnormal situation exists in Cologne, as it does in the rest of my consula. district. In Diisseldorf and elsewhere reports indicate 'that anti- Jewish measures have been even more drastic than in Cologne. 2 . No attacks have, as far as I know, been made on British subjects of Jewish race. There are one or two ex-service men of the Jewish persuasion who are normally resident in my district. I have the impression that they have either left Cologne or are keeping off streets. 8 . A complaint and demand for protection of property was received on the 10 th instant from a Herr Schwarz, who holds a'power3?'.' 1 — j 18 of attorney for the firm of Kleinwort and Co., Fenchurch Street, London, owners of three houses in Cologne occupied by German Jews whose windows had been broken. The local police were immediately informed. They promised to safeguard the properties. Herr Schwarz was asked to furnish details in writing. I should be glad to have instructions as to the general attitude to be adopted to such claims. 4. 1 venture to transmit herewith translations of two anonymous letters which I have received to-day, one from a person who describes himself as a “ Beamter,” the other from a person who describes himself as a judge. I make it a rule to ignore anonymous letters, but the writers have so well stated the views of many Germans that I think them worth transmission. I have, &amp;c. J. E. BELL. i Enclosure 1 in No. 7. (Translation.) To the Herr Generalkonsul, Cologne, 'November 12 , 1938. I feel the urge to present to you a true report of the recent riots, plunderings and destruction of Jewish businesses, dwellings and incendiarisms of synagogues. ^ The German folk have had nothing whatever to do with these riots and incendiarism. Since the incitements of the party members had not had the least effect on the man in the street, there came from the police wireless on the morning of the 10 th November, 1938, at 0*45 a.m. (a quarter to 1 in the morning) the following orders :— ( 1 ) At 4 a.m. the synagogues and chapels of the Jews were ordered to be set on fire. (2) At 6 a.m. the destruction and looting of shops and houses was ordered to begin in the city. (3) At 8 a.m. the same was to happen in the suburbs. (4) All action was ordered to cease at 1 p.m. midday of the 10 th November, 1938. Whilst the “angry and excited folk,” as the newspapers so well expressed it, still slept and had no idea of these orders, the police supplied all available young and newly enlisted S.A. men, strengthened by a mob of riff-raff, with axes, housebreaking tools and ladders at the police headquarters. A list of the names and addresses of all Jewish shops and flats was furnished, and the mob proceeded to do their work under the leadership of S.A. men. The police had strict orders to remain neutral. At 8 o’clock in the morning of the 10 th November, 1938, revolting fights amongst this mob over the booty were still to be witnessed, e.g., one of the robbers was carrying away eight suits of stolen clothing which he refusing to share with his dear German comrades. In Cologne alone seventeen shops have been so far completely looted.19 I he population of Cologne had absolutely nothing to do ivith this murderous arson and condemns it, as does also the whole German nation. These actions were ordered by the Government in Berlin. A certain police commissioner who intervened to save a shop from looting, has been placed on leave and relieved of his functions. Please take information amongst the Cologne people, and you will convince yourself that the German nation had nothing to do with these crimes and disassociates itself from this action of their Government. (Signed) EIN BEAMTER. Enclosure 2 in No. 7 . Translation of a Copy of the Original sent to the Reichsminister for Justice. The events of the 10th instant, with their anti-social crimes, such as incendiarism, looting, bodily violence, robbery and murder, in all towns and villages of Germany cause German judges to beg you for guidance in the forthcoming legal processes. Since these crimes against the social order have been staged by the Government itself, it would be advisable to quash all legal pro ceedings arising therefrom, since the public knows very well that no judge dare dispense justice without exposing himself to severe reprisals for his acting according to his conscience. More than 50 per cent, of the judges under your jurisdiction must do violence to their conscience, since the events which have happened are such as to make one ashamed of being German. Such ideas could only come from the narrow, criminal brains of a Hitler, Hess, Goebbels, Rosenberg, &amp;c., and must carry the conviction abroad that they are the same incendiaries who formerly set fire to the Reichstag, and who were responsible for the deeds of the 30th June, 1934. It would be better if you recommended all German judges to retire. It cannot be expected that German judges should do hangmen’s work. The events of the 10 th instant have unmistakably and clearly proven to all the world that a judiciary no longer exists in Germany. You, Herr Reichsminister Dr. Giirtner, are also responsible for what has happened, and you may depend upon it that we will bring you to book perhaps quicker than you think. Make sure of your own retreat by giving all right-thinking judges an opportunity to liquidate their sendees in a humane manner and by bringing the true situation before your friend Hitler, for the verdict that will be pronounced by all honest judges on you and your bandit friends will be death. (Signed) JUDEX.20 No. 8 . Sir G. Ogilvie-Forbes to Viscount Halifax. His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Berlin presents his compliments to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and has the honour to transmit to him a copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s Consul-General, Frankfort-on-Main, dated the 14th December, respecting anti-,Jewish persecution. Berlin, December 15, 1938. y Enclosure in No. 8 . Consul-General Smallbones to Sir G. Ogilvie-Forbes. Sir, Frankfort-on-Main, December 14, 1938. While the German Government has somewhat half-heartedly put it about that the action against the Jews, the burning of the synagogues, the smashing of shops and private residences, the assaults and looting were the work of the populace, incensed by the death of Herr vom Rath, it will be difficult to disclaim responsibility for the systematic treatment on a large scale by S.S. and regular police * of the persons arrested. I therefore venture to report on the treatment of some of those who were arrested. I am afraid this despatch will make unpleasant reading, but I consider it my duty to call a spade a spade. Those who have been released from the camps have been threatened with dire consequences if they divulge what happened there. The facts which I am reporting have been related by a great number of people independently of each other and they could not all invent the same lies, at the same time, about the same events. 2. I have served in Germany for some eight years. I have known the Germans, when I was stationed at Munich, in the hour of their humiliation after the war, and I have been at this post since 1932. I flattered myself that I understood the German character, and I have worked for an Anglo-German understanding to the best of my ability. Recent events have revealed to me a facet of the German character which I had not suspected. They seemed to me to have no cruelty in their make-up. They are habitually kind to animals, to children, to the aged and infirm. The explanation of this outbreak of sadistic cruelty may be that sexual perversion, and in particular homo-sexuality, are very prevalent in Germany. It seems to me that mass sexual perversity may offer an explanation for this otherwise inexplicable outbreak. I am persuaded that, if the Government of Germany depended on the suffrage of the people, those in power and responsible for theq^ outrages would be swept away by a storm of indignation if not put up against a wall and shot.21 3. I he following is a recital of what happened to a Jew, who was in the trenches during the war, who had a good business here, and who is a well-educated man. His statements correspond in detail with what has been told to us by other persons who went through the same experience : He was rung up by the secret police on the 11 th ultimo and ordered to stay at home. He was fetched at 3 p.m. He asked for permission to take a change of linen and some warm underwear with him. This was refused, but he was ^ told to bring some money. He was taken to the nearest police station and was kept there until a sufficient number had collected to till a motor lorry. He was then driven to the Exhibition Hall, a large building used for fairs and also for political meetings. It holds on such occasions well over 20,000 people. Outside the building a large crowd had gathered, which hurled abuse and invective at each convoy as it arrived. (Mr. Dowden passed there twuce on the day in question and observed that the crowd consisted chiefly of youths and women. He was under the impression that the women did not have their heart in the demonstration, and that they had been ordered to attend, in the same way as their menfolk had been ordered to bait the Jews and to work destruction.) Once inside the hall my informant was made to turn out his pockets, and their contents, including his handkerchief, were put into an envelope, and g^ie was told that he would get his property back on his release. He was then made to line up with the others, some of whom had been there since the night before without sleep, food or water to drink. The S.S. and police now had sport with their charges. They made them kneel down, cross their hands behind their backs and lean forward until they touched the ground with their foreheads. Those who could not perform this feat were assisted by the guards, who kicked them in the back of the neck. Others were made to run round the building. Some w r ere sick. The guards removed the vomit by taking the culprit by the scruff of the neck and wiping it away with his face and hair. 5. About 5 p.m. motor lorries manned by S.S. men drove up and the prisoners were driven into them with blows and kicks. They were taken across the town to a suburban railway station. When unloaded they had to go down some steps leading into a dark viaduct giving access to the platform. The guards rained blows and kicks on all they could reach. When in the viaduct they were halted and ordered to face the walls. They thought they were about to be shot and some became hysterical. The guards passed up and down behind them kicking and beating them. Some men in mufti joined in this sport. They were then entrained for Buchenwald, near Weimar. During the journey, which took several hours, the guards passed up and down knocking out teeth, bashing in heads and doling out black eyes. At Weimar they were detrained and f|jced^ with blows and kicks into over-crowded lorries. During the ^ry journey they were told to keep their heads between their knees and in that position they were belaboured with sticks.6 . On arrival at the camp they were driven with kicks and blows into a wire enclosure. (This was charged with an electric current and many were badly burnt who tried to escape. This comes from other sources.) They were then addressed by the commander of the camp, who told them what he thought about the Jews. Then every man had his hair cropped and his moustache clipped off. They had great sport with the rabbis whose religious tenets do not allow them to have their beards touched with the scissors. My informant, who was one of a party of about 500, was assigned to shed No. 1, the one nearest the gate. It was about 200 feet by 80 and about 2,500 people were forced into it. This on the face of it appears impossible. The explanation is that there were tiers of bunks in the shed reaching to the ceiling, in each of which three men had to lie. (A friend of mine had to sleep for sixteen nights in one of these bunks between two cattle-drovers. They had to lie sideways and when they wished to turn over in order to relax, they had to do so in unison.) 7 . The camp at Buchenwald was at that time under construction and this added to the discomforts. No water was laid on and there were no latrines. The prisoners were given no water to drink the first day and never any water for washing. (My friend above referred to went for sixteen days without washing except when he collected some rain water.) On the second day my informant was given a^ drink of hot water, flavoured to represent coffee, and some bread. The prisoners by then were half crazy with thirst and hunger. 8 . During the first night guards came in and picked out men at random and took them outside to be flogged. Fixed on the ground were two footplates to which the man’s feet were strapped. He was then bent over a pole and his head was secured between two horizontal bars. Men were given up to fifty strokes, except in the case of promiscuous flogging inflicted for sport, and each guard was only allowed to inflict ten lashes lest his strength gave out. (Flogging was ordered for trifling offences such as not jumping to attention quickly or not obeying an order. A rabbi was flogged because he refused to sign bis name on the Sabbath. He was then threatened with a second flogging. His spirit was too weak and he signed.) Some died stretched between the poles. Those who survived were kicked back into the shed. In the day-time the floggings took place in public as a warning to the others. Some went mad. They were then chained up and a sack tied round their heads to stifle their shouts. 9. During the first night men were not allowed to leave the shed to relieve nature. They used their hats.* 10 . My informant has false teeth and suffers from pyorrhoea. He applied for an extra glass of water a day to clean his teeth and rinse his mouth. The lack of water and his thirst were so great that he drank this water after using it. ^ * Six linrs have been omitted here owing to the unprintable character of the further details given.23 I 11. One other case has to be related: a former Prussian officer was ordered to kneel down and say : “ I am a dirty Jew and a traitor to my country. He refused and he was beaten until he did as he was told. 12 . Among the prisoners were famous surgeons and doctors and they worked miracles of skill and devotion. They even performed operations in urgent cases. The rabbis also proved themselves worthy of their calling. One rabbi when offered his release declined to leave t ie camp before the last of his flock. I have heard of no instances that any of the guards showed any signs of Christian charity or common humanity. 13. When the prisoners were released they were first examined by the camp doctor and none with open wounds were allowed to depart. The others were shaved and then reported to the political officers, who warned them that if they divulged anything they had seen in the camp, they would do so at their peril. ^ He added that the party would be able to strike them down even after they left Germany and wherever they might be. They were then handed back what was left of their belongings. Most articles of value had however disappeared and the money they had had on them was sadly reduced in amount. They were told that to complain meantnot “women and children first,” but men first; they are in the concentration camps and in imminent danger of death, and they are the potential bread-winners. If they die the problem of dealing with their families will be all the more formidable. 17. I gather that some of the Quakers wish to put up an organisation in Germany to feed and clothe non-Aryans, and that they contemplate gradual evacuation spread over a number of years. Unless the German Government agrees to such a scheme it is difficult to calculate what percentage of these people will survive their enforced stay in Germany. Lord Forrester, who has been here also on behalf of the Quakers, seems to contemplate the creation of camps outside of Germany, where the emigrants would be trained before being transplanted to their future homes. This would probably reduce the wastage of life. 18. I regret that I have to submit that the information contained in this despatch may be treated as confidential. The facts if broadcast and if not already known would probably rouse world opinion to a higher pitch of indignation. But the rulers of Germany appear at present to be contemptuous of world opinion. The only likely reaction would be to try and ferret out my informants for individual punishment or to inflict collective punishment if they cannot be found. Also if my name were mentioned it might lead to an incident. It might, however, be useful to bring the facts reported to the confidential notice of those Governments which contemplate doing something towards the solution of this problem. I have, &amp;c. R. T. SMALLBONES. No. 9. Consul-General Carvell to Viscount Halifax. My Lord, Munich, January 5 , 1939. I have the honour to report that, notwithstanding the threats of dire penalties which would fall on those released from the concentra tion camp at Dachau if they did not keep silence about their treatment, sufficient information has leaked out to enable some account to be given of the treatment extended to Jewish prisoners since the 9th November last. 2 . The Dachau Camp appears to have been the place of concentration for all Jews arrested in South and West Germany as far as Neuss and in Austria. According to some estimates, the maximum number of Jews in confinement was 14,000. Some 200-300 were released daily during December, and it is thought that above 5,000 still remain in custody. It is understood that all over 65 years of age and all ex-service men who served at the front have now been released. Boys of 17 from the Jewish seminary Wurzburg and professional men between the ages of 50 and 60 aZ still without hope of early release.B. Apparently the first day of captivity was one of indescribable horror, since no released prisoner has been able or willing to speak about it. It may be imagined that the prisoners, herded together like cattle in a stockyard, were tortured by the fear of the slaughterhouse. 4. On entering the camp every prisoner had his head shaved, and was given a coarse linen prison suit with a “Star of David” stamped in yellow upon it. It seems that no other clothing was provided, even after the onset of extreme winter weather. Under clothing could, however, be bought at the canteen at a price. Two hundred to 800 persons were crowded together in huts originally built for sixty to eighty persons. Some prisoners appear to have slept on the bare boards, but most had straw. At first each person had only one thin blanket, but now some have two. The food is of the roughest kind, and the Jews receive only half the quantities allowed to the Aryan prisoners. Six persons eat out of the same dish. Hot drinks, cheese, and also butter may be bought at prohibitive prices at the canteen. Each prisoner is allowed to receive 15 marks a week pocket money from his family. The delay in distributing this money was such that among those in the sixth week of confinement some had only received their second week’s allowance. 5. The prisoners are awakened at 5 a.m. each day. They are paraded at 6 a.m., and are often kept on parade for five or six hours on end without being allowed to leave the ranks for any purpose. They are made to do a great deal of marching and physical exercises, and are kept standing to attention in their thin suits answering repeated roll-calls. Generally speaking, prisoners are on their feet almost continuously from 5 a.m. until 7 p.m., and being unaccustomed to heavy military boots the majority suffer from sore and festering feet. 6 . Accounts of brutal treatment at the hands of the guards are too consistent to have been mere fabrications. Prisoners have been buffeted, kicked, and even beaten and bastinadoed with steel birches. Some guards never speak to prisoners without hitting them across the mouth with the back of the hand. The medical attendants are particularly callous in their disregard for prisoners requiring medical attention. Sixty sufferers from frost-bite were dismissed without treatment on being told that their affliction would eventually cure itself. 7. The day of release is a veritable ordeal. The prisoners about to be liberated are paraded in the open at 5 a.m., and are kept standing stripped to the waist until about 10 a.m., when the chief medical officer inspects them for evidences of ill-treatment. After the inspection a stream of ice-cold water from a hose-pipe is turned on them. Before leaving the camp they are addressed by the com- imindant, who advises them to leave Germany as soon as possible, ^ce should they return to the camp they would never be released. They are also warned that if they should spread “atrocity stories” abroad it would not be to the advantage of their co-religionistsremaining in Germany. They are then required to sign a document stating that they have not been ill-treated, have acquired no infectious disease, and have received all their personal effects intact. They are then free to walk to the station and pay their own fares to their homes. Many are unable to walk and some have been carried to the station unconscious. 8 . It is not known how many have died in camp or shortly after reaching their homes, but there must have been many. The names of ten Munich Jews who died at Dachau between the 9th and the 25th November are known. 9. The foregoing account has been based on a series of isolated scraps of information, and so, while there is no reason to doubt that the incidents described actually happened, the account should not be read to mean that the treatment meted out was throughout so bad as it would appear. Some of those released have said that their treat ment was “not so bad,” and that the camp was efficiently managed. It is probable that the treatment of prisoners varied considerably with the character of individual guards. I have, &amp;c. J. E. M. CAIiVELL. No. 10 . Consul Shepherd to Sir G. Ogilvie-Forhes (Berlin). Dresden, February 2 . 1939. I have the honour to transmit for information notes made of con versations regarding conditions in the concentration camp at Buchen- wald with German Jews who were sent there after the murder of Herr vom Bath on the 10 th November. I have, &amp;c. F. M. SHEPHERD. Enclosure in No. 10 . Memorandum. Jewish Persecution. Herr H.E.B., who is an apparently respectable fur merchant in Leipzig, told me that after the murder of vom Rath in Paris his shop windows were broken, and that when he went home members of the Secret Police were waiting for him outside his house and told him to go with them. His wife protested, but the police said it would be all right and that Herr B. would be back that evening. He was taken to the railway station, and he said that: “I cannot tell you how they treated us there.” He was taken to a concentration camp (Buchen- wald, near Weimar) where there were about 10,000 Jews confinedgjfi wooden barracks fitted with narrow bunks, into which they hac^o crawl. They were given no coverings and were unable to wash orhave a change of clothing, so Herr B. said, during a whole month in which he was confined there. For fourteen days his wife did not know where he was or what had happened to him. There were in the camp men of all ages up to 78, including professors and other leading Jewish men. Herr B. was allowed out because it was noticed that he wore an emblem showing that he had fought in the war. He was fortunate in being released before the sudden cold spell, and he tells me that many people died of cold after it began. The camp of 10,000 where he was confined was a small one compared with that devoted to Austrian Jews which exists in the neighbourhood. The men in his camp came from many parts of Germany, including Frankfort and Hamburg. In addition to his confinement in the concentration camp he has, of course, been presented with a demand for an amount of 20 per cent, of the estimated value of his entire property as a fine for the vom Rath murder. Concentration Camps. Herr H. V. was in the Buchenwald camp for three weeks under very severe conditions. There was not even enough water to drink, and there were only twenty lavatories for 10,000 men. He saw many beaten, and saw one arrive at the camp dead. On his release he was ^^old that, if he spoke about his experience, he and his family would be imprisoned for life, and if he spoke of it after he had gone abroad, he was told that there were “ Vertrauensleute ” who would finish (“ erledigen ”) him off. The men in charge were young S.S. men and a few of the regular Weimar Police. Conditions were incredible, and they had no change of clothing or washing facilities. Herr V. said that to the people in charge of this camp there were two classes of people, alive or dead, and that no consideration was paid to people who were old or sick. On the other hand, I heard from a Jewish doctor, who was also in the camp, that he was employed in looking after people who were ill or who had been injured. This doctor had seen people beaten with barbed-wire birches, and his particular occupation was to see that his patients, as far as possible, were healed of the scars caused by their ill-treatment. He knew of sixty-seven deaths, and thought there were until recently about 850 in the Buchenwald camp. British Consulate, Dresden, February 2 , 1989. No. 11 . Statement of a Former Prisoner at the Concentration Camp at Buchenwald.—(Communicated to the Foreign Office on Febi'uary 18, 1939.) Ifcanslation.) In present-day Germany no word strikes greater terror in people’s hearts than the name of Buchenwald. Only a few milesfrom Goethe’s Weimar, situated in the midst of a pleasant beech forest, ringed round with barbed-wire fences, guarded by S.S. detachments and machine guns, lies the new City of Sorrow, the concentration camp of Buchenwald. I was arrested at my home in Berlin at 5 o’clock in the morning of the 13th June, 1938, taken to police headquarters, and there informed that, as a Jew with a previous “criminal record,” I was now under preventive detention and would in due course be sent to a concentration camp. In the over-crowded police prison to which ^ I was first taken I recognised many acquaintances among the other prisoners, who were for the most part reputable people, business men and university teachers. Former convictions, the excuse for all the arrests, often dated back to a decade or more, and related to such crimes as breaches of traffic regulations, or childishly unimportant escapades of one kind or another. More and more prisoners were brought in till the police officials themselves were at a loss to find room for the stream of new arrivals. In the course of these two days, the 13th June or 14th June, every male Jew with any sort of police record was arrested. Some of the prisoners were over 70 years of age and were brought to gaol from the almshouses where they were living. In Berlin the number of arrests reached about 4,000; for the whole country the figure was probably between 10,000 and 15,000.^ These prisoners were all sent to concentration camps, Dachau, Sachsenhausen and Buchenwald. At police headquarters each prisoner was informed that he could expect his release only if and when he should have procured, somehow or other, documents permitting him to leave the country. It is therefore apparent that the arrests were a purely political measure, and that this typically Nazi device had been decided upon with a single view to hurrying along the tide of Jewish emigration, which, in the Nazi view, was flowing too slowly. Nevertheless, the carrying out of the arrests was entrusted to the ordinary criminal police, and not, as might have been expected, to the Gestapo. Hence, the Berlin newspapers reported merely that a “ number of Jewish criminals have been taken into preventive custody.” During the night of the 14th June 2,000 of us were transported from prison to the concentration camp. Before leaving the prison we were examined by an extremely youthful doctor, who passed everyone as physically fit for the rigours of concentration camp life, including the septuagenarians and a tubercular prisoner who was continually spitting blood. The Anhalt Station, from which we left Berlin, was closed to the public at 2 a.m., the time of our departure, and a strong force of police with rifles in readiness was on guard. At about 6 o’clock in the morning on the 15th June we arrived at Weimar, to find a “Death’s Head” detachment of the S.S. waiting for us at p* railway station. We hardly reached the platform before a hail xjf kicks and blows from fist and rifle butt drove us along to the subway29 leading out to the road. Here we were greeted by the then super intendent of the camp, Eodl, in the following terms:— “ Among you are some who have already been in gaol. What you tasted there is nothing to what you’re going to get here. You’re coming inside a concentration camp, and that means you’re coming into hell. Any attempt at opposing the authority of S.S. guards and you’ll be shot out of hand. We’ve only got ^ two kinds of punishment in this camp, the lash and the death penalty.” The entrance to the camp was guarded by machine-gun posts, and over the gate itself was written the slogan : My Country Right or Wrong! Every prisoner entered the camp by ‘‘running the gauntlet ” between two rows of guards. More kicks and blows. Immediately after this reception, which is more or less usual in all concentration camps, our heads were shaved, as is done with all dangerous criminals. Next our civilian clothes had to be given up in exchange for convict uniform. The dress of every prisoner is marked with a special symbol. Political prisoners wear a red stripe, bible students a lilac stripe, the so-called ‘‘work-dodgers” carry a black stripe. ^ Our loose convict jackets were marked with the Star of David in black on a yellow patch : this indicated ‘‘ work-shy Jew.” It is worth mentioning that most of us were independent business men, and the rest workers who had been forced out of their ordinary employment. Our group also included a dentist and several lawyers. Each of us was given a number, sewn into our prison clothes, and henceforward these impersonal numbers were substituted for our names. After the preliminaries just described, we were led off to our new quarters. While the 6,000 Aryan prisoners were housed in wooden barracks each holding about 140, we were quite literally packed into a number of cattle sheds, 500 in each shed. The sheds contained no tables or chairs. Not even beds. At night we dossed down on the bare floor, unable to stretch out and rest owing to the lack of space. Each prisoner received two thin (and often torn) blankets. There were no arrangements for washing. Not one of us was able to wash during the first week. Afterwards, eight wash-basins were provided for each group of 500. Water had to be fetched from a pump ten minutes’ journey away. What was most difficult to bear, however, was the fact that, in accordance with orders given by the S.S., a group of professional criminals was introduced into each shed and charged with the task of ‘‘maintaining order.” These criminals, also under detention in the camp, were set over us as ‘‘n.c.o.s.” and were given full authority to punish the other prisoners. The criminal in full charge of our shed was a particularly brutal ^^cimen, who continually and shamefully mishandled us. We were all too much afraid to try and protect ourselves from these inhuman brutes, as answering back would have been treated30 as mutiny and punished by death. A peculiarly horrible incident roui sticks in my memory. One of the older prisoners had, during the to h day, while we were at work, been so knocked about by the S.S. ' guards that, at night, in the shed, he kept up a continuous moaning. f 0 rn The brute in charge of the shed hit this man in the face repeatedly, be £ telling him to stop the noise. By morning the old man was dead. roui During the first two days in the camp w'e were given no food the whatever. In spite of that we were exercised hard enough. A whole ^ ^ 8u ffi week was occupied in attending to the various formalities connected ^ ^ won with our entering the camp; only afterwards were we assigned to not regular work. Among these formalities was the signing of a Bud declaration that we had been taken into preventive custody because i we were Jewish “shirkers,” unwilling to work. It was printed on worl the form that this admission was made voluntarily by the person as f signing. One of the prisoners, a lawyer from Breslau, refused to folio sign the form. This unhappy man was visited with every punish- start ment in the repertory of our captors. He steadily maintained his midc refusal to sign the documents. After the fourth day of his torture, was already a dying man, his body bruised and broken, only half- Fron conscious, he signed his name. I must now describe some of the publ punishments inflicted upon us by the S.S. Even slight offences— our i drinking some water during working hours—were punished with loss^^ /^as of midday meal and with having to stand to attention for four hours^ .o w&lt; during the short “free period” normally allowed on Sundays. But No f the main punishment was the lash. A public flogging was given for priso minor offences, for instance, if a prisoner was caught smoking at sevei work. At the end of the afternoon roll-call, the numbers of the appli prisoners sentenced to be flogged were read out—there would be far a several every day—and the men were led out and bound fast to the Dresi whipping-block. The usual punishment, twenty-five strokes with a out i raw hide whip on the buttocks, was carried out by two hefty S.S. burn guards, taking turns with the whip. A third S.S. man held the N victim’s jaws together to stifle any cries. Some of the older prisoners, be al unable to work fast, were flogged in this inhuman way for laziness. our \ After the flogging the victim was made to take down his trousers and day. display his bloody stripes to an S.S. man, whose business it was to grouj judge whether the lash had been strongly enough laid on. assig; Twenty-five strokes was the favourite punishment at Buchenwald, but right there were others. The “sweat-box” for example. It often panie happened that the prisoner was already dead before the “ sweat-box ” have was opened to release him. comp Another punishment was that known as “tree-binding,” and the inclm guards showed great inventiveness in developing the possibilities of houn&lt; this torture. If only a slight offence had been committed, the till w prisoners would be bound to the tree in such a way that they stood of ou facing it, and as if embracing it, their hands pinioned together. The we^w straps that bound them would be pulled so tight that they coiq^ li.^^i^ barely move. The guards would now play “merry-go-round” wdth traini them, that is, they would force them to make their way round and ^ liftround the tree. If they could not move quickly enough it was usual to help them by kicking their ankles. This was only the less severe form of “tree-binding.” Another form of the same punishment often ended fatally. The victim would be strapped to the tree, facing outwards, his arms pulled hack and round the tree trunk and then bound together. The thighs and feet, the latter only just touching the ground, would also be tied, sufficiently tight to stop the circulation of the blood. The prisoner would be left hanging in this position for hours at a time. It must not be thought that these barbaric tortures were exceptional. At Buchenwald these things were of daily occurrence. A week after our arrival we were set to regular work. Our working day in the concentration camp of Buchenwald was regulated as follows: we were awakened at 3-80 in the morning, roll-call followed from 4-80 to 5-80, then were marched off to work, which started a little before 6 . We worked without a break until noon. At midday there was a half-hour’s pause to drink the acorn-coffee that was given us. Work recommenced at 12-80 and continued till 8 - 45 . From 4 o’clock till 5-30 a second roll-call was taken, followed by the public floggings decreed for the day. Between 5-30 and 6 we ate our main meal of the day, and then worked again till 8 , when supper ^yas had. The day ended at 9 o’clock. On Sundays we were made .o work from 6 o’clock in the morning until 4 o’clock in the afternoon. No festivals were observed in the camp, not even (as I was told by prisoners of longer standing) that of Christmas. We were on our feet seventeen and a half hours a day, rain or shine. This time-table applied to the older as well as the younger prisoners; the sick, in so far as they were able to stand on their feet, as well as the healthy. Dressed in our convict clothes of “ substitute cloth ” we were forced out into every kind of weather from storm and heavy rain to the burning heat of summer. Now as to my first day at hard labour—a day which I will never be able to forget as long as I live. Several of the older prisoners in our working party died in the stone quarry on that blazing hot June day. After the morning roll-call we had been divided into labour groups each a hundred strong. To each group a foreman was assigned, chosen almost invariably from the habitual criminals, whose right it was to knock us about as he thought fit. We were accom panied by an S.S. detachment of guards, not one of whom could have been more than 18 years old. They were nevertheless quite competent at manhandling and beating us. Our column, which included several prisoners over 65, marched off, or rather we were hounded along by the S.S. men, all of whom were armed with clubs, till we reached the stone quarry where we were to work. Eighty out of our hundred had never done manual labour before. Nevertheless w^were expected to carry stone blocks so heavy that the effort of them would have seemed considerable even to a navvy in good training. Many of the stones were so heavy that it took several men to lift the block on to the shoulders of the man who was to carry it.These stones had to be carried to the site of a new road, a little over a mile away, which was being built by “ convict” labour. The way leading to the new road was fairly steep, and on the last third of the journey we were helped along by kicks and blows from the rifle butts of the S.S. men stationed along the route. The elderly prisoners, who found it physically impossible to fulfil their tasks, came off worst. From the road we went back to the quarry to pick up a fresh load, and then the process would be repeated. The sun rose higher in the heavens, and the day got hotter and hotter, the fast-travelling S.S. cars raised clouds of white dust on the road (it was closed to all but “official” traffic). Close to the quarry was a spring, bubbling with fresh, clear water. Prisoners who tried to approach the spring for a drink were driven away by the S.S. guards. By afternoon thirty out of our original hundred had collapsed, some of them with sunstroke, and not even the brutal onslaughts of the guards were able to bring them back on to their feet to resume work. We had to carry them back in the end to the camp hospital. All but two that had died. In addition to our work in the quarry, we also had to carry tree trunks from one place to another. No more than eight men were allowed to tackle even the heaviest load. Along the route S.S. men were stationed at intervals. We were continuously under observation. The shout, always accompanied by blows on head and shoulders froru^ the clubs of the guards and kicks from their jackboots, “ Move alon^^ blast you, get along”—still rings in my ears. It occasionally happened that a more than usually energetic S.S. man would order us to do knee-bending exercises while we were carrying our load. This was not without danger, for if one or more of us collapsed the heavy trunk was liable to crush the others. One day, before we were marched off to work, an announcement was made. We were told that “ the Jews had been throwing away their bread ration.” A measure was therefore to be taken to which no parallel existed, not even the annals of the Dachau concentration camp. Henceforward we were to receive half a litre of soup (all the others received a litre) and 250 grammes of bread (compared with the normal ration of 625 grammes). An unending regime of hard labour was demanded of us, and at the same time our food rations were fixed at the following amounts : a quarter of a litre of acorn-coffee in the morning, half-litre of soup at midday, and 250 grammes of bread with a smear of margarine and a little brawn in the evening. For three successive Sundays, though we were, of course, required to work as usual, we received no food at all. Relatives were allowed to send money to us from our homes. Parcels of food, however, were forbidden as “everything could be bought in the camp.” We will see in a moment how this system worked in reality. For the families of the poorer prisoners, every pfennig sent to the camp represented a real sacrifice. By reasoi^pf the mass arrests, it happened that many households had been depr^fd of their chief breadwinner. A number of instances are also known to me personally in which the Public Assistance Authority refused to. tii 33 'U st) allow or continue relief to a family the head of which was in prison. Those who actually received money were far from being able adequately to supplement their meagre rations. Part of the sum sent would be withheld to pay railway fares in the event of the prisoner’s release. This regulation was especially hard on the poorer prisoners, as the whole of a small sum would be “ set aside ” for this purpose. If more money was sent, it was doled out in weekly instalments of 5 marks. This sum, it is true, could be spent at the prison canteen, where very high prices were charged. The canteen was extremely badly stocked. It was always impossible to buy bread there, and it aften happened that the only thing on sale would be lemonade powder. In addition, it must be remembered that we had to buy and pay for soap, tooth paste and the like, out of our own money. In Buchenwald the number of deaths, both of Jews and of Aryans, was far greater than in any of the other camps. The Aryan death roll was at least one a day. Out of the *2,000 Jewish prisoners that arrived on the 15th June, eighty died in the first four weeks and thirty more in the fifth week. The authorities did all in their power to hush up these figures, and the Committee of the Berlin Jewish Community was officially informed of only thirty-nine out of the 110 deaths. How did it happen that these men died? A famous phrase— shot while attempting to escape ’’—must supply the answer. Here I must give evidence that, at least during the period of my detention, there was no single case of a prisoner being shot in the course of a genuine attempt at an escape. I he camp is surrounded by a wire fence, electrically charged a t night. At intervals there are look-out posts with machine guns, manned by S.S. detachments. The prisoners are forbidden to approach the wire. If they do, the S.S. are instructed to fire on them. Newly arrived prisoners were often ignorant of this regulation, and the S.S. men, bored at their enforced idleness on look-out duty, often amused themselves by calling a prisoner over to the fence. New prisoners would obey the order, and, as soon as they approached, the S.S. machine gun would open fire. This form of' “ joke ” was quite frequently indulged in. Every now and again, some prisoner, driven half insane and unable to bear the hellish conditions of the concentration camp any longer, would run like mad towards the fence. The S.S. invariably opened fire, and at once, although they were obviously aware that their victim w T as crazed, and not trying to break out of the camp. But most of the prisoners who die at Buchenwald die in the stone quarry. Round the quarry a chain of S.S. posts were also established which it was death to approach. It frequently happened that one of the older or weaker prisoners would be ordered to carry a stone block which it was physically impossible for him to manage. ^jj|p though he exerted every ounce of his limited strength. The “ guard would try again and again to force the prisoner to carry his load. Naturally the unhappy man would fall behind his84 companions. After a short while those who had filed past him would hear a shot. The prisoner had been driven out of the line by the guard and over to the S.S. post, who had shot another victim “ while attempting to escape.” One particularly tragic story deserves to be told. Among the Jewish prisoners was a youngster, 22 years of age, called Erich Lowenberg. He had been cantor in a synagogue, had married young, and his wife was expecting a child two months later. Erich LSwenberg—it happened about the 15th July, 1988— was driven by an S.S. guard on to the highway near the quarry and forced in front of a heavy lorry driven by another S.S. man. An hour and a half later the young man was dead. The physical maltreatment normally experienced by prisoners sometimes led to apoplexy and death. Cause of death would then be stated by the doctor as ‘‘weak heart.” Coffins were made by the prisoners themselves in the carpenter’s shop. The bodies were usually taken to Weimar crematorium and burnt. Relatives would receive official notification of the prisoner’s death by open unfranked postcard from the office of the Camp Commandant. Many also died because of the lack of medical service in the camp. In the early weeks the ambulance helpers were strictly forbidden to give medicine to the Jews, a ruling which was also responsible for its quota of deaths. Later it also quite often happened that the doctor in charge of the hospital refused to accept Jewish^ patients. One case is known to me of the doctor throwing out a sick man, declaring that he was faking his symptoms: the man was dead within two hours. In the sheds at night we had no means of helping a dying companion. We could not even lay our hands on a glass of water, much less obtain any medicine. We were also unable to leave the shed and go for medical asistance, for the S.S. guards were instructed to open machine gun fire on anyone seen leaving the building at night. Four weeks after our arrival a hospital shed was opened for the Jews. This had to be paid for by the Jews themselves. It lacked even the most rudimentary equipment. There were no thermo meters. Not even a chamber pot. And yet in this hell one came across human beings. There were S.S. men, a very small minority, who did not maltreat us. Some of the S.S. explained to us that they could do nothing about conditions in the camp. They received their orders from ‘‘higher up.” This higher authority was Herr Standartenfiihrer Kock, infamous as the perpetrator of nameless brutalities at the Kolumbia- haus in Berlin, and at the camps of Esterwege and Sachsenhausen, now in charge of the Buchenwald camp. How many deaths of defenceless prisoners has this man on his conscience? There were also some among the foremen who, at the risk of their own lives, attempted to help us. Some of them were denouiMfcl as ‘‘Jew-lovers ” by other prisoners, and publicly flogged. 5ar worst time followed the arrival of a detachment of young AustrianS.S., who were sent to Buchenwald from Wollersdorf. The tortures inflicted upon us by those men are beyond the power of any pen to describe. How is the population of a concentration camp in present-day Germany brought together? From what elements is the camp made up? In Buchenwald there were 8,000 of us, 2,000 Jews and 6,000 non-Jews. It is now proposed to extend the camp and make it, with a population of 25,000, the largest in Germany. Our 8,000 prisoners included first of all the “ politicals” (as, for example, the Communist members of the Reichstag: Neubauer, Saefkow, Woitinski and others), many of whom have been in various concentration camps ever since 1988. Another prisoner was the well- known Berlin defence lawyer, Hans Litten. His leg was broken in the stone quarry at Buchenwald recently. It had not completely healed from an earlier wound. In addition to the genuine political prisoners, there were many poor devils at Buchenwald accused of having spoken abusively of the sacred person of the Fiihrer. Most of these were sent to the concentration camp (under positive arrest) after the expiration of their prison sentences. The period of deten tion in these cases is left indeterminate. One of the hellish features of concentration camp imprisonment is precisely this nerve-shattering uncertainty. Protective arrest may ^Mnean detention for three months. It may easily mean detention for three years. No rule, no law, determines the length of the sentence. After the “political,” the category of the so-called “work-shy” is the largest. Anyone who imagines that this group has anything to do with tramps and vagabonds is grossly deceived. An example. A business employee lost his position and applied for unemployment relief. One fine day he was informed at the Labour Exchange that he could obtain employment as a navvy on the new motor roads. This man, who was looking for a commercial post, turned down the offer. The Labour Exchange then reported him to the Gestapo as being “ work-shy,” and he was arrested and sent to a concentration camp. Technical workers leaving low-paid employment to seek higher wages often meet with the same fate. The next group were the “ Bibelforscher,” a religious sect taking its doctrine from the Bible and having a considerable membership in every part of the country, but proscribed by the Gestapo since its members refuse military service; these unhappy people were almost as badly treated as the Jews. The fourth category consisted of the homo-sexuals, or at least of those against whom the Gestapo thought fit to bring charges of homo-sexuality. To charge those it dislikes with this offence is a favourite tactic of the secret police. At the time I was there Buchenwald contained no representative of this group. The last class of prisoners were the professional criminals. From ^|iir ranks, as I have said, our “ overseers” were drawn. Those of em who were set in authority over us were allowed to manhandle us as much as they wanted to. Many of them tried to curry favour36 with the S.S. by maltreating us or by making us “exercise” on Sundays during the rest period or forcing the older prisoners to roll back and forth in the wet mud. When it happened that a prisoner was actually to be released, he had first to submit to a medical examination, to see if his body still carried the mark of the lash, or was in any way bruised. A prisoner who still bore traces of his beatings was not allowed to leave until every mark was healed. In this way the authorities attempted to prevent any knowledge of the physical maltreatment of prisoners reaching the outside world. That these preliminary and precautionary measures are at all successful is to be doubted. The truth slowlv seeps through the barriers. At the time of my release—I was one of the very few who left the concentration camp without having obtained a visa for abroad—I was warned by a high S.S. official that even a whisper concerning my life m the concentration camp would be punished by death. The actual words of the S.S. leader are worth recording. “National socialism,” he said, “ has no reason to fear the truth. But it will not tolerate the spreading of fantastic atrocity stories.” After my release I received notice that I had to quit the country within five weeks, and that I should not be allowed to re-enter it. During those five weeks I would be under police supervision, and would have to report daily, first at the Berlin police headquarters an(^^ then later in my own district. The first time I reported at the police^ headquarters, something happened that seems to me typical of present conditions in Germany. When I arrived I found myself surrounded by a group of officials of the regular force, who eagerlv questioned me about Buchenwald. Remembering the threats that had accompanied my departure from the concentration camp, I at first refused to answer. They showed me their identity documents to allay my suspicions, and again urged me to tell them what conditions m Buchenwald were really like. They would see that no harm came to me. Then I told them of the things I had seen. They were so shocked that they could not help interrupting me. Such conditions they said, were revolting and a scandal. Frick and Himmler were responsible. No one else. They were at pains to impress upon me that they had no control whatsoever over the concentration camps, where, in fact, the S.S. had supreme and exclusive authority. I have myself lived and experienced the things that are here related about Buchenwald. I was in the camp for six weeks only and my account can therefore lay no claim to completeness. I know from trustworthy sources that the majority of those who were arrested in June at the same time that I was are still prisoners, and that th*&gt; death-roll among them still mounts.Forwarded ivith the compliments of the Secretary, Political Department, India Office.

In view of this exaggerated propaganda it is necessary to examine the true facts in some detail. On the 1st November 1939 over eighteen and a half million tons of British shipping (taking only ships of over five hundred tons) was operating on the high seas, and in addition nearly three million tons of coastal craft, trawlers and dominion shipping were in commission. The British mer chant navy, therefore, totalled twenty one and a half million tons, not including seven hundred thousand tons of new ships building in the United Kingdom. On the other hand British losses since the beginning of the war amounted to less than 250,000 tons, that is only just over one per cent of the total, and only a third of the new shipping under construction, while during the week ending November 1st our net gain, including captures and vessels returned to work, was forty two thousand tons. Thus it is evident that Germany* s desperate efforts to c ripple British seaborne trade by U-boat action have been a failure whereas her own submarine losses, amounting to some twenty out. of a total of sixty are out of all proportion to the damage she has inflicted.German Lies about Saudi Arabia The German Wireless has revived the absurd story that Britain is attempting to blockade the ports of Saudi /rabia. It will be remembered that the Saudi Arabian representative in Cairo has already denied previous reports on these lines which appeared in an Egyptian newspaper; and it is superfluous to add that Britain has never at any time had the intention of blockading the norts of Saudi Arabia or of any other neutral Power. Vv'e in Bahrain live on one of the important routes by which imports enter into Saudi Arabia and can see the truth for ourselves. Though, in order to prevent both profiteering and the depletion of stocks of foodstuffs and articles of daily use which have been imported here for use in Bahrain, a prohibition is olaced on their export, there is no interference whatsoever with the transit trade for Kasa; not one bag of rice or one yard of cloth consigned from exporting countries to Saudi Arabia, and passing through Bahrain in transit, has been held up here.1 v h No -C/ 658 of 1939.

Dear Weightman, His Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad has taken the opportunity during the Eid days, while he has been receiving large numbers of visitors, to speak publicly of his adherence to the allied cause in the present war and to reaffirm his sympathies with Great Britain and France in their fight against Hitler. His Highness stated that Hitler’s attempt to crush all Europe under his feet would have as little success as the effort of the Kaiser in the last war. His Highness welcomed the alliance between England, France and Turkey and stated that all Moslems were on the side of democracy against Hitlerism, he also said that the Moslems in the Gulf had reason to be grateful to Great Britain for her help and protection both now and in the past.

Ministry of Information have issued denial of recent German wireless statement that Indian troops have been drafted to France.Soapless Germans Recently toilet soap has become quite unobtainable by civilians in Germany, and the German authorities explain t that its absence is due to the need for increasing the comfor* of the troops at the Front. This explanation, however, is not borne out by news from the Front of a German Army Order dated 16th October 1939, which ansu^Ud that troops would L i_ l ,|- j T w dhrr i aL*£~ U' receive no permits to purchase soap, 44 available at army canteens.

Now after two months of war a large part of that fleet is lost and the remainder is powerless to carry on maritime trade. Thirteen merchant ships in all have fallen as prizes to the Allied Navies of which two were captured by the French, and a further eight have scuttled themselves to avoid capture. It is reported that German merchant vessels which have been sheltering in neutral ports since the war began are now trying to get home. This will lengthen the list of captures though some ships may slip back to Germany via the far North or by neutral waters. Another factor which is further reducing the strength of the German merchant fleet is the lack of currency. This has caused^vessels sheltering in neutral ports to sell part of their cargoes to defray harbour dues, and when this method of raising money has been exhausted, the vessels are compelled either to submit to seizure in harbour or to run the gauntlet' the French and British Navies at sea.

A neutral observer reports that unemployment figures in Germany have recently jumped from a few thousand to over a million. This is said to be largely due to the closing of textile and shoe factories, owing to the lack of the raw materials necessary for carrying on production. A shortage of fish is also likely to occur in Germany. Before the war the normal North Sea Catch was three hundred thousand tons per annum, as against only thirty thousand tons in the Baltic. Now, however, Germany’s fishing fleets are cut off from the North Sea and even in the Baltic their movements are restricted by the extensive minefields laid by the German and neutral Navies. England, on the other hand, presents a very different picture. British Industries in contrast to those of Germany, are working at full pressure, and, since the outbreak of war, seventeen British coal pits have been re-opened. The national output of coal has already increased by three hundred thousand tons a week, and soon,it is hoped, it will total two hundred and seventy million tons per annum.A / BROADCAST TALK ON HRESE TX SITUATION IN INDIA P! EPARED FOR T IE B.B.C. ARABIC PROGRA M ON 9TH NOVE.B R, 1939. The rxesent situfi.tlon in India:- A retly to German falsehoods. The constant theme of German 'broadcasts is that, firstly, India has no sympathy with Britain in the present struggle and is refusing to take part; secondly, that Britain professes to be fighting for liberty but denies self- government to India. These allegations are completely false. In India, with an area as large as the who^e of Europe and 370 million inhabitants, there are three outstanding interests in the political sense. They are the Congress Party which is mainly but not entirely Hindu, the Muslim League which is entirely Muslim, and the great Indian Princes, whose territories cover nearly one third of the whole ol India. Berlin alleges that India has no sympathy with Britain in this straggle. What are the facts? Each one of those three leading interests has made it clear in language that cannot be misinterpreted, that India detests with every fibre of its being, and entirely regardless of race, community or creed, everything represented by the Lazi policy, the Nazi war of oppression and the Nazi attempt to dominate the world. These statements have been published, with the full influence of India’s leading men behind them, and m every line they breathe warm sympathy with the Allied cause. It is true that the Congress leaders are engaged in an acute political controversy with other interests at the moment, but throughout the controversy they have continued to emphasise their hatred of Nazi policy and methods. That remarkable Indian personality, Mr.Gandhi, who sways the fortunes of the Congress Party, has consistently denounced the Nazis.'Hitler knows no God but brute force,' he cried when Poland was raped. Now sympathy must be translated into action for the lull strength of its sincerity to be realised. Berlin announcers state that Indians refuse to take any part in the war. That lie can be nailed to the wall at once. Indian response to the call to arms has been magnificent. Regular units of the Indian Army, which had such a glorious record in the last war, are serving overseas in Malaya, Aden and Egypt. Indian Territorials and the Auxiliary Forces are serving by the side of their professional comrades. The Army and the Air Force are being expanded and the recruiting stations have been so beseiged by volunteers that the authorities have been obliged to issue a statement pointing out that it is impossible to utilise all offers of service at once. And it is of added significance that these offers of service have not come only from the classes from which the Army is normally recruited, but from every class, community and walk in life, from Prince and peasant, from Muslim, Hindu, Sikh and Anglo-Indian. The princes and Ruling Chiefs, with their ancient tradition of loyalty and service to the British Crown, have offered their services and the resources of their States. In some cases, units from their forces are already serving with the Indian Army. They have lavishly contributed money for the prosecution of India 1 s war effort and in every way they are rallying the millions who owe them allegiance or with whom they have blood brotherhood. That great Muslim Prince, the Nizam of Hyderabad, apart from striking contributions in India itself,is54 3. &amp;.I 0 O providing a coirpiete eauariron for the British Air Perce. The Maharaja of Kashmir, vfiose subjects are predominantly Muslim, has offered all that he has. That proud Rajput, the maharaja of Bihaner, veteran of many v/ars, has proclaimed that at the age of sixty he is not too old to fight at the head of his gallant clans. These are but a few of numerous instances that could be quoted if time permitted. Remember these facts when Berlin pours forth its propaganda in shameless disregard of truth. Agairij so many contributions have been sent to the Viceroy that he has found it necessary to open a War purposes fund. Contributions have poured in from rich and poor alike, from the millions of the prosperous to the humble rupees of clerks and even the agricultural produce of the cultivators. In the industrial sphere, the whole country has vigorously tackled problems of expanding and converting peace-time machinery to war needs. As the months pass, India will not only provide more thoroughly for her own v/ar requirements, but for those of her allies and friends overseas. Let us turn now to the falsehood, often repeated in Deriin broadcasts, that England professes to be fighting for the liberty of mankind but will not grant self- goveminent -oidia. Let us examine the facts. As the x asuit of legislation passed four years ago, the eleven provinces of India were given the pov/er of self-government. ei okt of those provinces there were Congress ministries aiiril this week: the other three have ministries which are predominantly Muslim. India does not however yet possess a Central Governmentresponsible to the electorate for matters of common concern to the whole of India such as Defence and. Foreign Affairs. Why not? Firstly, it has heen proclaimed over and over again that England recognises Dominion Status and complete self-government as India’s ultimate goal. Not only does England acknowledge the objective hut has worked patiently for its achievement. What then, you may ask, are the obstacles to India being given immediately the status of a self-governing Dominion as demanded by the Congress Party? If the Congress Party represented the whole of India, such a demand would clearly invite immediate attention. But the Congress Party does not represent the whole of India, though it is the largest numerically and represents an important section of Indian thought. It does not represent the Princes: it does not represent some eighty million Muslims, and it does not represent other important minorities. And the Muslims and other minorities are fearful what would happen to them if India should be given self-government without prior and clear safeguards for their rights and special interests. The Muslim League, which speaks for the Muslim community, leaves no doubt whatever in its official statements that Muslim rights must be safeguarded and its fears of Hindu domination must be removed before they can stand on a common platform with the Congress Party to press for complete self-government. This unhappy position is not of Britain’s seeking or making. Britain could not simply accede to Congress demands over the heads of the Princes,and of the Muslims and other minorities. It would be grossly unjust to the Muslims and others ana probably turn into an impassable gulf the rift which diviaes the different ■:yr communities in India. Through her long association with India over several centuries Britain has inherited the responsibility for ensuring that the form of government India would have when British control ceases is one wnich is acceptable and would bring contentment to all her people. Britain, therefore, cannot concede rhe demand of the Congress, which does not represent all the people of India, that British control should first be removed forthwith and that the people should be left to settle their Qonstitution for themselves afterwards. But because this demand has not been granted Congress refuses to co-operate in the war and the Congress Ministries which have been governing eight Provinces have resigned. Unceasing efforts have been made by the Viceroy to reconcile the differences between communities and political parties, with a view to making an advance. He has just brought together again the leaders of the Congress Party and the leader of the Muslim League, but the result 'was another deadlock. Until the Muslims and other minorities are reassurea, no progress can be made. That position, unhappy though it may be, is clearly not Britain's fault. when Indians have composed their differences and make a united approach to the chief problems, then only can Britain stand aside from nor present obligations and witness with pride the just fulfilment of India's destiny. Now, however much these differences between Indian^ and Indians, between the races and religions of India, may influence political action and lead to political difficulties and disunion, yet tho moral spirit of India, Muslim and Hindu alike, is united against that hateful tyranny which Hitler has made nls religion aria which Britain nas taken up arms to crush. ./natever6 . falsehoods Eerlin may broadcast and whatever political differences may exist in India, it would be difficult to find one single Indian among 370 million inhabitants to say a good word for Hitler and his works.I ^ : &amp;0, Telegram From To No. T/613.

At the start of the second month^orVthe war we have a | 1 better idea of its probable form* | / deliberately conducted. The heaviest^ fighting may result from attempted sallies by the enemy, aerial as well as military. For the Germans as w elves, the real struggle Some people, looking'at- thqf war-map and seeing the extent \ \ i that she has thereby become mc^re formidable c They should compare it with the area ohat $r/as under German control in 191S C the north-ea :taly; Hungary; Jugoslavia; Rumania; Bulgaria; Turkey; Albania; Estonia; Latvia; Lithuauiao She furthermore held all that purt of Poland just annexed by Russia, and more than half of the Russian province of the Ukraine, with its vast cora-grow'ng prairies. After the Peace of Brest-Litovsk, in March 1918, supplies from the interior of Russia were available to her then as now. With all these areas to draw upon, Germany went down in defeat. It seems likely to be an Allied 'Siege of Germany is now about to begin. T curtain-raiser of Poland was but a of the new territory that won in Poland, suppose Yet in the autumn of that ySaj? she collapsed^ On the ~ ’ 1 unconditional submission to the Allied Comma rermany had at her disposition not only the resources oe all the countries she at present dominates, but also thbse of: Belgium^ eleven departments of north-eastern France; X No/No wonder the Nazi Government is hoping to talk Britain and Prance out of the war before it has really begun. The failure of this week’s promised ’’peace-offensive” will be the downfall of Hitler's sclisme for becoming master of Eastern Europe at small cost. WHAT THEY TOLD ME The Germans never made any secret of their plans. 'If you attempt to interfere with us by force,” they often said to me, ”We shall remain entirely on the defensive in the West while we are settling things to suit ourselves in the East. '.Then that is finished, you will soon get tired of running your heads against our impregnable Siegfried Line, and will be ready to make peace.” Supposing, hov/ever, that we do not choose to run our heads against it? That is a contingency that the Germans cannot afford to leave out of accounto Time is working for us and against them* They stand now at their peak of readiness for war* If the British and French Governments had known for certain that they would one day have to fight Germany, and had been asked what time would suit them best, they would have replied. 'The summer of 1940.” /hen Hi uler last ^.arch broke his Munich pledge by swooping on Czecho-Slovakia it became clear that war was all but inevitable. Arms contracts, held up in hope of peace, were sent out. During the summer these munitions began to trickle in. That trickle has now become a stream; by next spring it will be a flood. Meanwhile, Germany is cut off from all overseas supplies. For her to wait is to weaken. But what can she do? If she flings her armies at the French Maginot Line they will meet another Verdun on a vaster scale. Goring once told me that, in the opinion of the German General Staff, an attack on the Siegfried Line in sufficient force to have any char.co of/of breaking through and invading Germany would entail 350,000 casualties a week* The cost would be even greater for attackers of the Maginot Line, deliberately planned and built over the past 12 years, whereas the Siegfried belt of isolated ’strong points which Hitler claims to have himself designed after a fortnight s intensive study of works on fortification, was hurriedly constructed during the summer of 1938, and is believed to have defects in consequence* No general likes to make a frontal attack* Yet the Fuhrer, infuriated by the presence of French troops upon German soil which he has so often proclaimed impregnable, jnay order his military chiefs to take the offensive aga^iiSw them* Such a counter-attack might commit the Germans against their better judgment, to an assault on the French fortified works. If General Brauchitsch looks for a way round this formidable obstacle, the alternatives are perilous* First, he must put Germany still further in the wrong with the outside world by violating neutral States* Secondly, he would add to the number of her adversaries new and well—equipped armies fighting in defence of their own territory* A German attack through north-western Switzerland could only be a forlorn hope* The Swiss have several lines of fortifications designed to resist it, and 600,000 troops, whose ancestors used to be the best professional iighc..i.ng men in Europe, are ready to defend then* The invasion of Holland and Belgium would perhaps seem preferable to the Germans, for? if it succeeded, it would give them air-bases within a few minutes T flight of Britain, and harbours for submarines which proved oheir utility in the last war. Here/Here again, however, are fresh fortifications and armies that would need to be overcome.* The Belgians have 800,000 soldiers ready mobilised and some 250 aeroplanes, while Holland can put 550,000 men into the field, and has 500 machines^ Both these Low Countries have made plans for flooding parts of their territory on the line of a possible G-erman advance, while the Belgians have strengthened their frontiers since the last war by a long chain of concrete gun-emplacementSo Even if this were forced, the Germans would still come up against the recent extension of the Maginot Line along the southern frontier of Belgium. In this war the task of the German generals is far more difficult and dangerous than in the last. To cope with it, they have always counted on being able to concentrate all their first-line troops in the West, leaving the semi-trained soldiers of the ScS. to hold down Poland, Czccho-Slovakia, and other conquered countries. But the presence of a mighty Red Army on the Polish and Slovak frontiers, across which live Slav populations that may look to Russia for liberation, will make it indispensable to keep strong forces in Eastern Germany. NO NEED FOR HURRY Only one arm remains to the blockaded and besieged Nazi leaders. Their great force of long-range bombers is still intact, not having been employed in Poland. If they should decide to use this against British and French cities, there could be no surer sign that they despair of winning by an other means than H frightfulness.” Such action would lay open to even more devastating reprisals the densely populated towns that run one into the other along the Lower Rhine, for these could be kept under perpetual bombardment by aeroplanes ^^c1 on French territory. There need be no hurry about the siege of Nazi GermanyI v/hich has been so well begun. The drain on her accumulated stores is already sapping her strength from within. Hov/ever tough the garrison itself may be the citizens are by no means united. Yesterday the Fuhrer’s Deputy, Rudolph Hess, announced by v/ireless the distribution of 'crosses of honour' to German mothers who had borne many children to serve as cannon-fodder in Nazi campaigns of aggression. The German nation may not take long to realise that it is with another sort of cross that they v/ill have to pay the price of the mad ambitions of their self-appointed rulers.CONFIDEN TIAL.

The very ostentation with which it had been prepared and the lack of resolution in pushing it through were typical of divided counsels.

In the early part of the week, they went to the Firth of Forth and Scapa Flow no fewer than eight times in two days, and lost eight machines: they went twice more later on in the week, have also been twice to the N.E. coastal area of England and launched a singularly unsuccessful attack on a convoy in the North Sea, when they lost four machines.

The only advantage would be that we could use our motorised divisions and there would be a possibility of com paratively open warfare, but we cannot lightly set aside the inter vention of two other armies. “ The other alternative is that of sitting tight and doing nothing except making small offensives.

Its effect may be seen in the agitated conversations that have been taking place in Berlin and the summoning of the Ambassadors from Ankara, Moscow and Rome to conferences in Berlin. Indeed, the problem of what to do on the Western Front has become quite dwarfed by the even more urgent necessity of trying to cover up the diplomatic blunder in which Rib bentrop has been involved. We now have a great additional security in the Balkans, as Turkey, the strongest nation in that part of the world, will fight rather than FRONT C. Temperley allow Rumania to be overwhelmed. She will equally take the field in the Eastern Mediterranean if Italy ever comes in on the side of Ger many, though this possibility seems to be receding. The main point of all, perhaps, is that she will presumably allow the fleets of Great Britain and France through the Dardanelles if we believe that the interests of our friends require it. Russia will never fight so long as the Dardanelles are open to our fleets, which can appear on her flanks.r'^x rtrTi’YTr i r No. C/731 The Hon’ble the Political compliments to 'he Political Agent, Bahrain. and has the honour to transmit to him a copy of the undermentioned documents (s).

There are also, with the same Printed letter, various nevspaper cutcings the latest of which is dated the 30th October and most oi them are a week older. Probably the finest example however is a photograph of some ancient Royal Air Force fly ng- boats which was taken in 1 j 37 when those flying-boats themselves were out of date.

Interesting evidence of the effects of the Allies' 0 / t A. A** h ai Blockade on Germany's economy comes from Yugo-Slavia, where it is learnt on excellent authority that^^SrT^is unable to supply textiles of any kind, tin plates or rubber goods. The shortage of thelast is strikingly illustrated by the fact that 125 lorries recently delivered to the Yugo-Slav Army arrived without tyres. In this connection it is worth remembering that L *(&lt;\ Germany imported 118 millions Beichmarks worth of rubber in 1937, whereas her entire supply of rubber from abroad is now cut off. The $una substitute besides being considerably more expensive to produce than ordinary rubber, and of less lasting quality, covered only one fifth of Germany's peacetime consumption. As regards the supply of tin plate one third of by Germany's iron ore imports are now cut off/the Blockade, and Sweden, which supplies two thirds o^ the remainder, could not even cover Germany's peacetime requirements. The shortage of textiles is particularly interesting as the Blockade has cut off the German export trade and hence should have left a surplus inside Germany equal to about one third of the total German production. Germany's inability to supply textiles is therefore presumably due to the shortage of textile raw materials and suggests that the stocks held surplus at the outbreak of war were limited. Supplies of cotton from Russia are relatively inaccessible and it is moreover estimated that Germany's wartime require ments in cotton equal two and a half times the expected maximum Soviet output for 1942. Lore light on Germany's textile shortage is shownby '-he fact that Norwegian wool importers are stressing the opportunity for British cloth manufacturers to increase their trade in Norway owing to the 30% adulteration in German cloth. It is further reported from Switzerland that the Oerman Government have now stopped all exports of sewing silk owing to the lack of raw materials in Germany, that clothes are being rationed there, as well as food and Thus, from all these reports from neutral t countries it is evident that despite Nazi allegations to the contrary, the Pranco-British Blockade is having an increasing ly severe effect in Germany. This is confirmed by the news petrol. &gt;i|''CONFIDENTIAL.

(b) in individual packets posted as if by a private person to special addresses (cigar shopst cafest etc. whose proprietors were known to be friendly). ic) the agents of British firms! particularly Shipping Companies (usually in the firn^s envelopes and with the general mamage^s compliments).

As at present no such periodicals exist the scheme applies only to original photographs and being only in its early stages should not be tod expensive. This metnod of publicity was considered very effective particular ly in early days.

I now find that even t&gt;ie telegrams that are sent to me are out of date. I enclose one which I h&lt;ve received this morning and which was sent off from London during the night.(it is not of the le*st use to me). Since euters yesterday mentioned that sidings in just over a week have risen to thirty, it is not much use telling me that up to the 21 st there had only been sixteen including neutrals, ihere is no mention of our so-called 'repris; Is' in intercep ting German exports in neutral ships; and frankly I an unable to puzzle out a reason for sending me a tele 'ram on the 26th about the situation as it stood on the 21 st, when everybody who has a wireleis, or knows someone who has a wireless, is aware th/t there hrve been major develo ments since. 2 . I should have thought too that it would have been worth whdia sending out some publicity stuff about the Belgo- Dutch peace proposals. I have not h d a word about this yet and I‘'am now having to concoct some stuff from memory of what I heard myself on the radio. / / h f / f &gt; v ours sincerely, L ' / / / The Honourable Lieutenant- Colonel C.G.Prior, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. tie* ‘ \ : f /THE UNSEEN WAR By October 14th, the British Navy had confiscated 338.000 tons of goods destined for Germany. The French Navy had seized 150,000 tons. Thus, in the first six weeks of the war, the total seizures amounted to no less than 488.000 tons, worth many millions of pounds. The confis cated goods included both foodstuffs and products necessary for the manufacture of munitions, such as iron ore, manga nese ore, aluminium ore, haematite ore, and phosphates. It also included wood pulp, from which paper is made, and oil. This action of the British Contraband Control is no more spectacular than is the keeping of water from a palm tree : no visible catastrophe occurs : there is no lopping of branches, no cutting of roots: all that happens is that the palm tree dies ! It dies because the nourishment that it re quires cannot reach it. The whole policy of the British Navy today is to achieve this object. The sea sare already cleared of German ships: the last of the submarines will eventually lie buried in their nameless grave ; and in the meantime their task will become increasingly difficult with the full establishment of the convoy system. Week by week the French and British Navies are perfecting their instrument of ECONOMIC WAR. What have they achieved already? In the first two weeks of the war, they seized about £1,000,000 worth of goods, 48,500 tons of petroleum, 41,850 tons of iron ore, 7,900 tons of haematite ore, 30,100 of manganese ore, 15,000 of aluminium ore, 7,300 of wood pulp and 15,000 of phosphates. The latest seizures include 1,000 tons of manganese, 3,000 tons of oil and fat, 40,000 tons of foodstuffs, 1,000 tons of rubber. X Each of these products is vital to a country at war. Manganese ore is essential for the manufacture of shells. So is iron ore. Two thirds of Germany’s iron ore must come from abroad and are liable to capture. And as for petroleum, if she had even the whole of Russia, Poland and Rumania to draw from, their supply is not sufficient for her needs. She is calculated to have consumed over 7,500,000 tons last year in peace time. Her production was 550,000 and is unlikely to rise to over 1,000,000 for some time: and there is no doubt she will need at least 10,000,000 tons a year to carry2 t , I i n u K n on the war. Less than a third of that can be produced within the Reich : she has not accumulated large quantities (a three months’ supply is estimated) and in any case the physical difficulties of storage prevent the building up of substantial reserves: she must rely on imports at the rate of 6,000,000 or 7,000,000 tons a year—which she can get only from Rumania or Russia. Russia, with an army in the field, is not likely to have any oil to spare—her surplus in 1938 was less than 1,000,000 tons—and as for Rumania, her last year’s total was only 4,500,000 tons. An enormous deficit must still be made good if German tanks and lorries are to crowd the roads behind the Siegfried line, if German aeroplanes are to darken the western skies. The British Navy’s task is to see to it that this enormous deficit is not made good by imports from lands across the sea. ^ CONTRABAND CONTROL How is this task accomplished ? When a country is blockaded it means that all ships going in or coming out are stopped and seized. But Germany is not to be blockaded. Her commerce with neutral countries is allowed, and only such goods forbidden as may help her troops in war: arms, ammunition, explo sives or articles and materials used to make explosives ; fuels, aircraft, ships, land transport and anything used in their construction or preparation; all tools, implements, maps, or documents useful in operations of war; coin, bullion, currency, and metal or material used in the manu facture of such ; and—in a second category—food, fodder, clothings, and the materials used to make them. These can and will be seized on board any neutral ship. But while, in a blockade, the ship itself would be seized and confiscated, in the present circumstances the cargo only is taken, its destination is decided in a Prize ^ Court according to the rules of international law, and is t either confiscated, requisitioned, sold or—if found to have been unjustly taken—returned to its owners. A vast organisation lies behind this quiet procedure. In almost every corner of the globe, all possible sources of supply open to the enemy are watched. Through financial houses, insurance and transport organisations, etc., the pro gress of contraband is followed: at every stage in their devious journey, the goods destined for the enemy are3 delayed, until often their final capture is decided only when they have come to within convenient distance of a British port. The actual seizure is but the last act in a drama that has been pursued in secret across the oceans of the world. Meanwhile many bases have been established for inspection and contiol (Kirkwall in the Orkney Islands, to the North of Scotland, Weymouth in the South of England, the Downs, and Noi th Foreland in the East of England, Gibraltar and Haifa in the Mediterranean). Here neutral ships call and receive facilities as soon as possible to continue on their voyage ; and since those that come of their own accord are attended to first, many neutrals now help in this work of control by prompt compliance. Germany watches these sea-defeats with growing and impotent rage. She cries out against “ lawless pressure ”, regardless herself of law when she sinks neutral ships with out warnings, and shows by the violence of her calumnies the depth of her fear. Beyond her quick and bloody triumphs against the small heroic nations, she sees in the distance, slow but inevitable as Death, the spectre of defeat. Hitler is a maniac with a loaded weapon in his hand ; he could not be kept from shooting: he can, and will, be prevented from re-loading to shoot a second time. The strength of Britain’s Navy will take from him eventually the means of continuing his war. FRIENDLY CARE FOR NEUTRALS. It is impossible to carry out the isolation of Germany without inconvenience to neutral trade ; but Britain is do ing all she can to make that trade easy wherever it is not destined for Germany. To say that she starves the inhab itants of neutral countries is one of those lies whose stupidity is shown by the ease with which they are refuted: many of the neutral Governments themselves have been helping to organise the necessary control in the least troublesome manner, and friendly negotiations are already under way. No difficulty at all is made to the normal imports of neutral states : if they show—as in one case—a sudden leap up wards since the outbreak of war, pressure is naturally brought to bear upon them by means fully recognised by international law. It is a slow and undemonstrative form of warfare: but it has this fact to its credit—that it has enabled Britain to vanquish her enemies for nearly 400 years. Information Office, Aden. 26th October 1939.The British War Effort at Sea The magnitude of the British /ar effort at sea is well shown by the expansion of the personnel of the Royal Navy. /• This was greatly increased before the war owing to the needs of the rearmament programme and to the commissioning of the ships of the Reserve Fleet for which there d-fl* normally no Prior to Rearmament the British Navy mustered only 92j000 men but by April 1940 the total will have risen to T—*ar 131,000 # 4j»G 1-u-ding-4rhoao o.va-i- j, ^ ^ Kb k * ^ v in'' ThJ 1 t,t^r f’n r I + 46,000 men of the Naval Reserve who have already been called up. fc Besides these the Royal Navy is now enlising young men for the duration of hostilities only, and a further great expansion in personnel is taking place to provide crews for the large number of auxiliaries joining the Fleet. During the ensuing twelve months it is expected that atleast 50,000 more men will be recruited and this will bring the strength of the Navy up to a total of 22^,000 men. /(V !

In this connection it is worth noting that an article in the “Economist” of June 3rd estimated that the German Railways owned seventy thousand trucks too few^and also .tha.t in the October number of the “Revue Deux Mondes'^ it was pointed out that the German Railway authorities instead of replacing rolling stock at the normal rate of ten thousand wagons per year, had only ordered thirteen thousand since 1S32. There is a similar shortage in locomotives. There were l twenty four thousand in service in 1929, but by 1938 this number had dropped to less than twenty one thousand and is now still lower, as the 500^600 engines scrapped early this year have not been replaced. Additional transport difficulties in Germany due to the progressive deterioration in the state of the permanent way were further illustrated by the recent serious railway accident in German Silesia.

Ends.GE RMANY'S SHORTAGE OF RAW MftTKRI'LS FURTHBR EVIDENCE. The secret anxiety of the German Government about the British control of essential war supplies is constantly reflected in broadcast items designed to show that the control is ineffective. Further evidence, however, of the British stranglehold is shown by items such as the admitted shortage of irfinin Germany and the fact that supplies of soya beans and soya oil are to be sent by the long and prohibitively costly trans-Siberian route. Recours* is even had to such small imports as are possible by parcel post. This additional evidence merely confirms what we have already learnt of the serious shortage of various essential V supplies and commodities in Germany, such as rubber, oil, petrol, textiles, meat, eggs, sugar, bread and soap, all of which are now strictly rationed, and in many cases unobtainable. ; r (« ^^7 L v *FACTS ABOUT THE BEL'tC-DUTCH PEACE PROPOSALS. f In view of the strenuous efforts mrde by the Germans to distort the truth about the offers of mediation t ' between the belligerents which were made early in November ✓ by the King of Belgium and the Queen of Holland, it is desirable to recapitulate the facts briefly so that mis understandings caused by German lies may be removed. It will be remembered that the Dutch and Belgian Sovereigns sent joint personal communications to His Majesty the King of England, to the President of the French Republic /&lt;/ and^Herr Hitler offering to mediate between the belligerents. A few days later His Majesty the King, after the British Government had carefully considered the proposal, replied in a personal message detailing the causes which led to the outbreak of war, and stating tiat no country is more devoted to peace than Great Britain but that the British peoole sought for a peace which would provide justice for those countries which had been brutally over-run by the Germans and which would remove from the whole of Europe and the world the ever-present menace of German aggression. The President of the French Republic also sent a personal reply in similar terms. It was made clear that the objective of both coun tries was a permanent peace based on confidence and the removal of fear and not merely an interval of armed truce. It was made equally clear that if proposals likely to lead to such a resultjcould be elicited the British and French Governments would gladly consider them. Meanwhile the Germans had continued to sink neutral ships and had concentrated troops on the Belgian and Dutch frontiers. On hearing of the replies sent by King George and by the President of the French Republic- replies which had been acclaimed as logical and proper by the newspapers of America and other great neutral countries, the German Government/-Government finally sent a verbs! communication through their foreign Minister to the Dutch and Belgian Ministers in Berlin saying that the British and French replies left no room for peace. The form in which the German reply was sent was deliberately discourteous to the Belgian and Dutch Sovereigns and this discourtesy was greatly resented both in Holland and in Belgium. What did the German reply mean in effect ? It meant that they would make no peace which gave justice to » Poland and Czeckoslavakia, that they would moke no peace which prevented them from menacing the security of the smaller nations of Europe in future and that they would make no peace which would enable the countries of the world to resume a normal life, free from the constant danger of brutal aggression in any direction by the German Government. The German Government would make peace,it is true, but peace on the condition that they could break it at any moment when, after re-organising their military and economical position, they might choose to do so. When the Germans discard this atti tude and prove that they no longer wish to bully, harrass and menace their neighbours but are ready to live in peace with them and to promote the prosperity of the world, the British and the French Governments will not be found backward in welcoming proposals for mediation.C.12.37.
