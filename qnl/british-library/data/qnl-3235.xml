Inform you that Syed Abdulla bln Syed Bader, one of our subjects, and his brother dyed Husain bin Bader left Bahrain in their boat for (cutting) wood on the sea coasts to which they previously used to go and cone. They landed at a place named Alniqay’ah on the .^atar coast and collected some wood. This was on 4th Rabi auwal. Hamad al-^ahtani, one oi Shaikh nbdulla bin Qasim al-Thani’s servants cane to them, took the wood and burnt ‘I it in their presence. They cane back and told us of this incident. This action has annoyed U6 very much, as our subjects always go to the coasts as it was in the past. This treatment by the * servants of Shaikh-Abdulla will cause disturbances to take place. -? as you are aware these coasts “are always visited by the people.

M’s political Agent, Bahrain. ^ Memorandum:- His Highness has instructed me to take down a statement from a Bahrain Nakhuda regarding an incident on the Qatar coast. The practice of bringing juss from the Qatar coast to Bahrain is a very old one. Before the quarrel between Bahrain and Qatar a large proportion of the juss used in Bahrain came from Qatar where people from Bahrain were allowed to collect juss without objection. Since the agreement between Bahrain and Qatar, according to which conditions are supposed to have reverted to what they were before the quarrel, people from Bahrain have once again taken to going to the Qatar coast for juss. According to the statement the complainant who was collecting juss on the coast was interfered with by three of Shaikh Abdulla’s armed men who took from him most of the contents of his two boats. With some difficulty they got to Hawar and then returned from there in another boat. Adviser to the Government. Enel S.Z.Statement of All bin Sid, Rumaihi Tribe, Bahrain subject, living on the edge of Manama. Last Thursday I went with my two boats to get juss at Broog on the Qatar coast opposite Hawar. I have been going there lately two or three times a month, sometimes more, and nobody has ever interfered with me. I reached there on Friday and three men, servants of Shaikh Abdulla, with rifles, came to me on the shore and said they wished to search my boats. I had no objection. They searched my two boats and took my sails, cooking pots, coffee pots, clothes, a fish net and its. 30/- and they then told me to go away. They were not ordinary Bedu because they carried the rifles and ammunition of Shaikh Abdulla. 7/e came back to Hawar and left our boats there be cause our sails had gone.

We submitted our complaint to you, because we found that when writing direct to Shaikh Abdulla we have never received from him any satisfactory replies. According to his letter to you he states that he published an order in 1357 forbidding Bahrain people to land on that part of the i^atar coast. This is true.

U.3. r'&amp;POLITICAL AGENCY, BAHRAIN. (g) D.C. No. C/776. My dear Belgrave, sending to the sheikh of Qatar. I hope that it complies with your request to send such a letter as made to me on the telephone on the 2nd August? and also that it will M do some good', as you said you thought it would. Dalrymple Belgrave, Esq., C.B.E., Adviser to the Government of Bahrain,confide:] riAL . D.O. No. P 12 (Camp) Shiraz, Datad the 23rd August, 1945 My dear Colonel, Like, I suppose, most Political Agents, Bahrain, I get a strong feeling or nausea when the name of Zubara is mentioned. I regret, therefore, to have to address you on the subject. The last official letter to you on my file appears to have been Hickinbotham’s despatch No. C/1915 dated the 20th December, 1944. The guards mentioned therein were withdrawn from the fort and, I believe, have not been replaced. I do not suppose that anyone imagined that that was the end of the case and that Bahrain and Qatar were then about 'to live happily ever after'. If anyone did, disillusion was rapid and complete. 2. Sheikh Salman contends that (i) before the rupture in 1936, his subjects freely visited the land of Qatar (ii) as the agreement negotiated by Hickinbotham in June, 1944, 'restored the status quo ante 1936 without referring to any of the issues between the two houses' (Hickinbothara*s despatch to you No. C/968 dated 24th June), Bahrain subjects should now freely visit Qatar. .. : ^ j /7 r 3. Sheikh Salman was not long in taking action to test the validity of his contentions. In March of this year he sent some of his people to graze their flocks in Qatar and when they were detained and harassed by the Sheikh of Qatar's men he burst into full cry on the subject of his grievances. Since theu, his complaints to the Political Agent have been made, in and out of season, on all sorts of occasions, at the same high pitch. (Corres pondence on the subject runs to about eighty pages). 4. Hickinbotham, apparently after consultation with Sir Geoffrey Prior, replied to the Sheikh's complaints suggesting that 'should your Highness consider that your subjects are not being accorded by the Sheikh of Qatar the privileges which they received in the past then Your Highnes is at liberty to take the matter up with the Sheikh of Qatar either verbally or by direct correspondence'. . ; 5. About ten days after I took over in April last the Sheikh, with Belgrave's active help, repeated exactly the same gambit with me - Qatar took the sane action - and the Sheikh made the same complaints. For a while, I dealt with them by referring him to Hickinbotham’s letter last quoted. But his argument, given verbally at great length, was unanswerable. It was that the Political Agent had not only initiated the negotiations for, and brought about the 1944 'agreement' but had also (Belgrave verified this) advised the sending of Bahrainis to Qatar - to test 1^. How Uickinbotham could then feel justified, in view of the Qatar action, in washing his hands of the matter by telling /the Sheikh .... Hon»ble Lt-Col ‘ ' ^ ^ ^ Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (Camp) Shiraz .- 2 - the Sheikh to negotiate direct with Qatar, I do not know. Nor could I be expected to, since Hickinbotham had refused my written request to him for a handing over note with the remark that he would n answer any questions’*. Unfortunately most of them, as was natural, arose like this one, after he had left. ^ • 1 7 6. The next move by the Shaikh showed no originality. In May, both Belgrave and he wrote to me that (i) Bahrain juss gatherers had always before 1936 gone to the Qatar Coast to gather juss (ii) the June 1944 agreement restored conditions as they were before 1936 (iii) the Sheikh of Qatar was not carrying out the 1944 Agreement because his men had just molested Bahraini juss gatherers on the Qatar Coast (iv) the political Agent had motivated the 1944 Agreement and (the implication wasi) it was up to him to see that it was carried out. ^ fa* X 5 ' 7. I referred this complaint to the Sheikh of Qatar and his reply was that (as is a fact) in 1938, he had issued orders prohibiting anyone from visiting the Qatar Coast. When Bahrain heard of this reply and returned to the charge I inquired from the Sheikh of Qatar whether (i) Bahrain subjects had not always visited the Qatar coasts to collect juss before the 1936 disputes (ii) his prohibition of the Qatar coasts to Bahrainis was cancelled by the 1944’’Agreement”. The reply was a categorical negative to both questions. Cs * 2 . * ‘ 8. It may be as well to recall the phrase in the 1944 ’’agreement” upon which the Sheikh of Bahrain relies in these cases. It runs ’’The Ruler of Bahrain and Ruler of Qatar agree to the restoration of friendly relations between them as they were in the past”. Now it is possible to argue that either Bahrain or Qatar J is justified in the line either has taken in the cases quoted. The agreement is so vague that almost anything can be argued therefrom. But I must emphasise that no hope whatsoever, even if one argued and decided in favour of Bahrain in these particular cases, is perceptible by proceeding on these lines. The reason is this - the Sheikh of Bahrain does not care particularly whether a few of his subjects collect juss on the Qatar Coast or graze their cattle on Qatar land. What he is interested in to the point of mono-mania (”It sours his whole life” Belgrave said) is in trying to establish his right to send his subjects to do these things - with a view ultimately to making such a ’’right” one argument in favour of his sovereignty over Zubara. The Sheikh of Qatar is perfectly aware of the position and fully resolved to resist Bahrain ’’infiltration”. No ruler worth the name could be expected to do anything else. 9. I hope it is clear from the foregoing that Sheikh Salman has at least some grounds, whether fully justified or not, for Complaint, and that the position I have been in of having to temporise is undignified and perhaps unfair, and will have to be met. But there is another more important reason why matters cannot be allowed to stay as they are. As I have alluded to in my Demi-official letter No. p 8 dated the 19th August, 1945, concerning Bahrain Development, the sheikh is tending to make the Qatar question a bargaining counter /in all....in all cases where his co-operation is required. The enclosed copies of correspondence forwarded to me by Packer of Petroleum Concessions, Limited, are a further illustration of this tendency. As I wrote in my other letter we cannot allow it to be persisted in but the mere adoption of a negative attitude will not insure us the co-operation required, flfhat then is to be said to the Sheikh when, with his countenance cast in an expression of catastrophic gloom, he again comes forward with his complaints that the sheikh of Qatar is not observing the 1944 Agreement? 10. We should not try to have it both ways by, on the one hand, refusing to interpret the agreement and to enforce our interpretation and, on the other hand, by telling the sheikh of Bahrain that he must continue to observe it by not re-enforcing the blockade. If we cannot do the first we should be able to say to the Sheikh that if he considers the Sheikh of Qatar is not observing the agreement he himself may take any action he likes even if it involves setting aside the agreement and reverting to the conditions as they existed before it. Before we can think of doing this it is necessary to be clear as to the answers to two questions, viz., (i) What did the agreement achieve? (ii) If we told the Sheikh that he was at liberty to set it aside would he do so? 11. The results of the agreement are set out at paragraph 4 of Hickinbothanks despatch No. c/1424 dated the 4th October, 1944. I do not think that the alleged adverse effect on trade or on the con servation of shipping space (especially as the war is now over) are developments to be feared from a reversion to the conditions prior to the agreement. But before making a similar decision regarding che effect on the labour position in Bahrain of a pro hibition of the entry of Qatari labour, I would have very carefully to ascertain the amount of Qatari labour employed in Bahrain especially in the oil company since the possible loss of any labour from Bahrain is not to be contemplated with equanimity. When in the course of my many conversations with the Sheikh I touched tentatively on the possibility of reverting to the conditions prior to the agreement he carefully avoided making any suggestion of a reply to my implied question. The reason for this was suggested to me by a remark of Belgrave*s that the Sheikh did not wish to revert to the earlier conditions since the agreement had improved the position in Zubarah. I assumed that he referred to the removal of the guards from the fort there. 12. My conclusion, therefore, is that when the Sheikh next complains that the Sheikh of Qatar is not fulfilling the terms of the agreement he should be told that he is at liberty to take whatever action he likes, even if it involves reverting to the conditions prior to the agreement provided that two conditions are fulfilled (i) No adverse effects on the labour situation in Bahrain result from a reversion to the /previous-4- previous conditions. The fulfilment of this condition would depend on (a) the number of Qatari labourers in Bahrain, (b) whether even after setting aside the agreement the Sheikh would expel Qatari labourers from Bahrain (this is doubtful since it would mean his losing the chance of acquiring extra subjects and this would be cutting off his nose to spite his face). (ii) There is a strong probability in view of the advantage gained at Zubarah that the Sheikh would not take action to set aside the agreement (if he had been told he could do so and then he failed to taKe such action we would be in a very strong position). 13. As you will see, this letter is mainly for information and in order to apprise you of my ideas regarding my probable line of action in this matter. As the concluding paragraphs will show, I am unable, without further examination of the case, to make any concrete proposals for dealing with this question. Yours sincerely,POLITICAL AGENCY, BAHHAIN.

After many discussions and much correspondence between myself and the Political Agent the Political Agent brought to me at Rafaa on 23rd June a which Shaikh Abdulla bin J'asim had signed o of the conditions written in this agreement would be carried out I signed it in the presence of the Political Agent, my uncles and my Adviser. I should like to point out that in this matter I did not deal directly with Shaikh Abdulla but the Agreement was made through the Political Agent who acted as mediator between us, it is therefore to the Political Agent that I now protest that the terms of this Agreement have not been carried out by Shaikh Abdulla though they have been strictly carried out by myself and my people.

We on our part immediately allowed our people and the people of i4 a ' tar to go and come between the two places as they used to until 19^36, when the present dispute began, and within a day or two the Shaikhs of ^atar themselves, first Shaikh Hamad bin Abdulla and then others, began coming to Bahrain. Since then there have been no restrictions on Q#tar people coming to Bahrain, this is well known and can be clearly seen, as an example during the last two months according to our passport figures and ration registers about 600 persons from Q,atar have entered our country. Thus as far as we are concerned, the people of Q,atar enjoy the same conditions as they did before 1936. 5. The state of things at Zubara however is very different. Although Shaikh Abdulla agreed that conditions there would become as they were before 1936 yet he has done nothing to restore to us the rights at Zubara which we had before 1936. He continues to retain a garrison in the Fort which he built close to the Gala Marir, our people whom we permitted to return to zuoara after the^^reement, first having discussed the desirability of their going there with the Political Agent have been su bjecte d to persecution and we do not ..Ill ' ' II i r tl-OUH. *•» enjoy the freedom in the Zubara area which has been ours froiii the time that our people lived in Zubara until the quarrel between us and Shaikh Abdulla bin Jasim.3 &gt; 6. We earnestly request you to examine our case and to help us to obtain the conditions which were agreed to by Shaikh Abdulla in the Agreement which was reached between ourselves and him through the mediation of the Political Agent. 3.Z.No.c/607 Political Agency, Bahrain, The 8th June, 1946.

S&gt; 2. i enclose a copy of a letter which the Shaikh of Bahrain has addressed to me on the subject oi aubarah. I, like the Shaikh, do not propose to recapitulate the original causes of the dispute, nor do I propose to enumerate the manner in which shaikh Abdulla bin Qasim has failed to carry out the terms of the agreement. I thimt, in fact, it would be difficult to do so in view of the nebulous terms of the agreement, though possibly the maintenance of a guard by the Shaikh of Qatar in his tower at JALAT MARIR is a definite instance. 3. While I have been political Agent, Bahrain, I have not heard so much of the Zubarah dispute as ay predecessor, but the situation as regards feeling in Bahrain over the 'loss of Zubarah' is very much as stated in Felly’s demi- official letter quoted above. I have, however, had many long talks with Shaikh Salman on the subject with the upshot that I asked him to state his case in the form of a letter. This he has now done. 4. To turn to the shaikh’s letter, you will see that in paragraph 3 he states that the political Agent brought him the letter to sign, and that as it was the political Agent who conducted all the negotiations it is, therefore, the political Agent who must see that the agreement is carried out. This attitude is repeated in paragraph 6, and is logical enough. 5. A difficulty with which I am faced in approaching the problem is the vague wording of the agreement under which it is almost impossible to tie any one party down to any one thing. I, myself, do not know what was really intended nor what reading the two shaikhs actually place on it. I know that Shaikh Salman reads into/more than it says. He writes that the meaning of the agreement is clear. That is wishful thinking, though if read with Hickinbotham*s explanatory letter No.C/958 dated the 21st June, 1946 (copy sent to you under cover of Agency letter No.c/968 dated the 77 24th June, 1944) the period of the hark back is clarified. I cannot conceive that shaikh Salman was so simple at the time as to think that he would get back all his ’rights’ in Zubarah, nor that Abdulla would be so forthcoming as to give them back just out of 'respect and courtesy'. 5 ' 9 Kon»ble Lt-Col. W.R. Hay, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulff (Camp) Bahrain. /6. To consider.....- 2 - 6. To consider th« agreement sentence by sentence, the first sentence stipulates the restoration of friendly relations between the two Rulers *as they were before*. This cannot but mean as they were before 1936 when the Shaikh of Qatar seised Zubarah and is an expression of bon vislonage. 7. In the second sentence the Ruler of Qatar under takes that **Zubarah shall remain without anything happening in it which was not there previously**. The meaning is difficult to follow, and ‘previously* is not defined, whether it means before Qatar built his tower or after I don»t know. One would naturally suppose the former, but against that it seems unlikely that Qatar would so easily agree to demolish the tower he went to such pains to establish and in which he still maintai-uc a guard. It is this guard and tower which rankle so with Salman. g. jn the next sentence the shaikh of Qatar aixirias that he is acting out of **courtesy and respeot for the Al Khalifah’*. The translation of the agreement on the files does not use these words, but they are a more correct translation that the words ‘consideration* and treverence'• ’Whatever the accurate translation may be, this sentence may prove useful in discussions with t he Shaikh of Qatar for it would be useful to know what ttm he undertook to do in the rather humble term ** *♦ 9 # in the next sentence the shaikh of Bahrain under takes to do nothing to harm the interests of the Ruler of Qatar. This sentence is horribly vague, and it may refer either to Zubarah or Bahrain. It must be read to mean *in Zubarah* otherwise the Shaikh is not at liberty to take retaliatory measures against the shaikh of Qatar should he wish to do so. 10. The last sentence concerns Qatar Concessions Limited and is not relevant to the present case. 11. You will probably agree that the document's meaning is vague even for an Arab document, and I think the first thing I should do is to endeavour to establish what Shaikh Abdullah intended by the agreement. That will be no easy thing, but if I can succeed, which I doubt, I shall have something to work on to meet Salman's ’minimum demands' under the agreement, that is to say, the withdrawal of the Qatar guard from the tower and freedom for Bahrainis to move about in Zubarah. His statement that Shaikh Abdulla agreed that conditions should return to what they were before 1936, and that he would restore to the Shaikh of Bahrain the rights he held in zubarah before that date - vide paragraph 5 of the shaikh's letter - are '’rnaxirauia hopes'. 12. That the agreement in its present state is not workable is obvious and well known, and a course to /rectify........-3- rectify matters which must be considered is its complete cancellation. I f myself, an loath to suggest this since the document was sponsored by the political authorities and for them to have to cancel it would be unfortunate, but it may come to that* Another point is that Shaikh Salman could argue that the very existence and method of preparation of the document provide him with political recognition of certain, rather uncertain, rights in Zubarah* 13.

As for the statement of the Shaikh of Qatar that many Bahrain boats anchor in Qatar ports without paying any anchorage charge, in this connection I would like to point out that this statement can hardly be believed because there are only a few boats which are used for carrying lime stone from Qatar and they take many days to do a trip to Qatar and back and another couple of days for exposing their loads. From this it can be imaginePthat it is impossible to find many boats approach ^atar ports daily as stated by the Shaikh of %atar.

According to Hickinbotham*s letter No.C/968 dated the 24th June 1944 the agreement of 1944 restores the status quo ante 1936. I have been endeavouring to ascertain from the Residency records what this status quo was. I can find it nowhere exactly defined but according to Residency Express Letter No.370-3 dated 21st May 1937 it is roughly described in Bahra^d telegram No.114 oi the 20th May 19 37 • Do you confirm exact definition? 4.

So far as I can understand the position it has always been the policy of Government to prevent the Shaikh of Bahrain from interfering on the mainland and I am of opinion that in no circumstances could we recognise his sovereignty over Zubara. Is the sovereignty ol the Shaikh of Qatar over Zubara officially recognised? Even if it is it is still incumbent upon us to ensure that he recognises any rights of usage, pasturage etc. which the Shaikh ot Bahrain or tribesmen who are his subjects may possess hk Zuhasa. -Colonel A«C.Galloway * C# I.E. ,0#B.E., Political Agent, BAHRAIN .6* I gather from your letter that the main bone of contention is the toner at Jalat Marir and its garrison. My present view is that under the terms of the agreement of 1944^we should insist on the toner being evacuated and ne should do our best to ensure that it is demolished. It would require great pressure on the Shaikh of Qatar to make lb him destroy the—himself as this would mean great loss of face to him but is there any possibility of his agreeing to the demolition if it is undertaken by Government?

Up to 1936 certain of the Naim tribe over whom the Shaikh of Bahrain claimed sovereignty used to graze their flocks at Zubarah without hindrance and paid taxes to neither bliaikh. To this might be added that certain members of the Al Khalifah used to live at Zubarah and brought their camels and herds over from Bahrain to graze seasonally and occasionally Also members of the Al Khalifah family used to proceed to Qatar for shooting trips. This situation was changed by bhaiKh Abdullah*s action, which was prompted by a movement in the oil world when Messrs. Lermitte and Dickson of petroleum Concessions Limited visited Zubarah, one by land and the other by sea, while making a preliminary survey for a port for landing equipment on the west coast of the Qatar peninsula. Major Hickinbotham was Political Agent at the time and his that Qatar has the greater claim to Zubarah and the situation cannot, I think, be put better than was done by Sir Trenchard Fowle in his telegram No. 680 dated the 4th July, 1937. The Government of India agreed with Sir Trenchard Fowle*s conclusions, but did not authorize a final closing of the Bahrain Zubarah claim, vide Government of India telegram No. 1552 dated the 6th July, 1937. It can be said, therefore, that Qatar*s claim to sovereignty over Zubarah is officially recogni®^ f , # since that decision was taken to alter the position. The Shaikh of Bahrain talks large about the graves of his ancestors, but Shaikh Hamad bin Abdullah was most scornful and said that he knew of no more than two, or at the most three, Al Khalifah graves in Zubarah. He said that they belonged to the dead and would continue to do so and that no one would interfere with them. There are Al Than! buried under the Petroleum Concessions Limited tennis court at Jufair, but that does not give the living Al Than! any right to play tennis on the P.C.L. courti is not accurately speaking the main bone of contention, it is rather the evidence of sovereignty built by Shaikh Abdullah bin Jassim some time after the 1937 incident, and it greatly 2 I am afraid that I cannot add much of use at His Majesty’s Government has agreed long since 3 I do not think that anything has transpired 5 With regard to the tower at Jalat Marir, it Bahrain C. I. ., annoys /11 2 i ^ ^ annoys the Shaikh of Bahrain. I am pretty sure that the Shaikh of Qatar would never agree to our demolishing the tower on his behalf as you suggest, and I do not think that you could insist on the Shaikh of Qatar evacuating it for I doubt if we should be on sufficiently strong ground, let alone the fact that as long ago as 1875 His Majesty*s Government refused to intervene on behalf of the Shaikh of Bahrain in Qatar. You may think that the 1944 agreement comes into the picture, but my view is that the divergencies of opinion of the two Shaikhs of the time of w previously'* estops that. The Shaikh of Bahrain, backed by the Political Agent 1 s letter (No. C/958 dated the 21st June, 1944, forwarded under our letter No. C/968 dated the 24th June, 1944), maintains that it means ante 1936, while the Shaikh of Qatar - which information I ascertained on my recent tour - maintains that it means ante the date of signature. This is reasonable, and I note that Hickinbotham makes no mention of discussion on the point in his Note dated the 18th June, 1944, forwarded under Agency Printed letter ] 9 dated the 19th June, 1944. I discussed the point e Shaikh but he held firm to his opinion. The tower wj between the years 1936 and 1944, and therefore the i f Bahrain can maintain that the Shaikh of Qatar has the agreement by building the tower but the Shaikh of uld hold the Reverse. Khalifah and Bahrain subjects to Qatar and the Shaikh, rather Shaikh Hamad for Shaikh Abdullah was absent being sick, said that any member of the Al Khalifah would be most welcome in Zubarah, but that previous warning of their arrival would be necessary to enable the Al Thani to make suitable arrangements. 7 # as regards Bahrain subjects visiting Zubarah, he said that they might come and that they would be accorded the same treatment as Qataris visiting Bahrain. That seems fair enough* and in keeping with the agreement for the status quo ante - so far as I know - was not that Qatar was open to all Bahrainis but that the rights of movement were as I have described them in paragraph two of this letter• , , ^ f+JU Q I ~isr I broached the question of visits from the Al 6 Yours sincerely, JANG&gt;( I •7V CONFIDENTIAL.

The guiding principle in this case seems to he that the sovereignty over Zubarah vests in the Shaikh of Qatar but that for political reasons the Shaikh of Bahrain may not be told this. 3. On the strength'of Hi ckinbotham* s letter No. C/968'dated the 24th June 1944, I was under the impression up to date that both parties recognised the fact that the agreement of 1944 “restored the status quo ante 1936“. It now appears that this is not the case and in these circumstances the whole agreement is quite useless and we must endeavour to bring about another one. 4. I am still of opinion trat our main effort should be to persuade the Shaikh of Qatar to leave the tower at Jalat Marir un-garrisoned and un-repaired if he cannot be induced to demolish it. Circumstances now are very different from what they were in 1875 and I think it is incumbent upon us to endeavour to bring about some modus vivendi between the two Shaikhs. more 5.

Zubarah as everybody knows is an inseparable part of Qatar. It is my country and not yours.' As a result of this shaikh aalman sent a strong protest to the Political Agent who replied on instructions from this Residency that the Political Resident bad never supported His Highness 1 claims to the Zubarah area. About this tims Shaikh Salman sent some of his subjects to Qatar to graze their camels and flocks there as they used to do in the past. On their landing they were met by one of Shaikh Abdullah 1 s men who told them that they could not leave for Bahrain without his permission. This led to another protest from shaikh Salman and ever since he has been addressing the Political Resident and the Political Agent about his ’•rights’ 1 in Zobarah. in July 1945 he even tried to make the favouraole settlement of his claim to Zub&amp;rah a condition precedent to lease of some land to the P.C.I'. According to my latest information the Shaikh^ subjects are now travelling to and from Qatar without any interference and the chief thing that rankies in Shaikh Salman's mind Is the existence of Shaikh Abdullah^ fort in the Zubarsh area. The past history of the cuae however shows that tne Al Khalifah's real object is to get Zub&amp;rah recognised as dahx&amp;in territory.

In spite of my letter as soon as formalities ^ere over the dhaihh started off at once on the subject of Zubarah ana resisted all my attempts to stop him, uhen I eventually did get him to talk aoout other subjects he kept on breaking off and returning to hubarah. He said he had brought papers with him which he wished to snow me but I refused to see them. He talked at great length about 'my rights' and 'my land' and so on and complained that it was two years and two months since he had signed the agreement ana nothing had been done to implement it. He complained of the further delay caused by my refusal to aiscuss the matter until Colonel Calloway’s return and saia that no doubt the matter would oe further postponed owing to my departure on leave. He said he was becoming a laughing stock of all the Arabs oecause in spite of his friendship with the British he was unable to obtain his rights. He did not refer at all to the tower in the course of tne conversation but mentioned chiefly the restrictions the ChaiKh of Q.atar was placing on Bahrain subjects entering and leaving lubarah. If I understood him rightly he stated that he did not claim sovereignty over Cubarah but only wanted his grass and water. »hen I ranarked that there was no profit for him in Cubarah he replied that it was not a matter o'f profit as he knew that there was nothing of value in Zubarah but one of prestige. He said that Zubarah was of more importance to him than anything else in the world and that so long as the present position existed he would continue to remain in a state of anguish. He finally said that he could not bear the present uncertainty and wanted a decision one way or the other even though it was unfavourable. I replied that I could not possibly give a decision until I had heard what the Shaikh of Q,atar had to say on the subject ana suggested that I might even have to inspect the spot. b. as soon as I was able I brought the conversation round to the subject tnat I wished to talx to tne Shaikh about.

I referred to the la ex of any development plan, the bad state of the roaas, to the need for a hotel, town, planning etc. I also mentioned tne difficulty that Colonel Bloodwbrth had experienced in obtaining land fo r ah automatic exchange at muharraq and to the unsatisfactory position that had been cheated by the fact that although Hr. Tunnicliffe is nominally 3roup Captain Leigh’s 'assistant he has not been placed in subordin ation to him. Shaikh Salman first said that he coula not do anything until the Subarah question a ad been settled, at which I showed obvious signs of annoyance. He then said that Bahrain was greatly in advance of the other Gulf States so far its administration was concerned, and that he could not be blamed for being conservative in expenditure when the oil refinery coula be completely destroyed by one bomb. I did not argue matters at great length but contented myself on this occasion by giving tne Shaikh my views. I think he load probably been informed beforehand the subject regarding which I wished to speak to him and briefed by Hr. Belgrave.

As regards your note of the interview, I think it sums up the Shaikh’s words, but I should like to suggest that the Shaikh did not, I think, place emphasis on 'sadaqa' but rather on 'salat' a word used in the Arabic translation of letter No.C/958 of the 21st June, 1944. 3. The point is not of great importance, but one which I do think you might add is that Shaikh Salman showed us correspondence between himself and Shaikh Abdullah bin Jasim in which the former had described Zubarah as his territory. This had been vigorously denied by Shaikh Abdullah. 4. I did not actually hear Salman talk about Shaikh Hamad. 5. With regard to your paragraph 4, I agree that the Shaikh requires the situation restored to the state existing before 1936 basing this on the Agreement and the above quoted Agency letter. vours sincerely, The Hon'ble Lt-Col.

Hay has informed the Sheikh of Bahrain that he intends to tour to Zubara sometime this cold weather and will make suggestions after that. 2. Shaikh Salman however wishes to send some of his people and camels over this autumn and to that end I approached Sheikhs Hamad and Abdullah. 3. Both emphatically informed me that the Sheikhs, their people and their animals would be treated with the utmost respect and would not suffer at the hands of the Qatar Government nor the Qatar people. 4. Sheikh Abdullah himself said that they would be welcome but that they must live in tents and that the erection of any sort of building would not be allowed. This seemed to me reasonable but I did not comment. 5. I pointed out that some of Salman's people might be Naim and that Sheikh Salman would possibly consider them his subjects. Sheikh Abdullah said that Qatar Naimis were Qatar Subjects and that if they returned to Qatar they would be subjected to Qatar Law. Shaikh Abdullah said that there was a Shariah Court. 6. He added that if Qatar people went to Bahrain they were subjected to Bahrain Laws but that on their return to Qatar obviously they reverted to Qatar Laws. This was quite obvious and as it is agreed that Shaikh Salman has no sovereign power in Qatar I again made no comment, but accepted the statement. 7. As regards the tower of Jalat Marir, Abdullah said that it was ruined and that his people were in his fort and would not molest the Bahrain people. (ITD.) A.C.G. 28/10/46.

DESCRIPTION OF ENCLOSURE Note dated 11th November 1946, by the Political Resident, Persian Gulf. SUBJECT : BAHRAIN - QATAR RELATIONS/ I called on the Shaikh of Bahrain on the 2nd November, 1946, and had a long talk with him on the subject of Jatar. I told the Shaikh the results of my recent visit to Qatar, vide N/Paras.46 to 53f The Shaikh,as usual, expressed doubts as to the genuineness of the feelings expressed by the Shaikhs of Qatar and I was left with the usual impression that he did not really wish the matter jet tied on the lines on which we are now working. This conversation lasted two hours during which the Shaikh said that he had hopea that I would settle the problem for him and that indeed the Resident had given him to expect that when he wrote his letter I pointed out to the Shaikh tnat the Resident had said no such thing to the best of my knowledge and that he should not jump to that conclusion. He said that the matter has been hanging fire for a long time and that I had never given him a definite reply. I replied that there were many reasons why I was hesitant in the matter and that one was not because I did not know how to deal with the real claim. I said that it was not just to put the onus (of delay) on me and that if he really v/ished an early reply he must be prepared for me to say that in my opinion he (the Shaikh) had no rights whatsoever in Qatar or Zubara. I advised him to let us deal v’ith the matter in our own way. He talked a good deal more about his claims going back as far as Turkish days and I said that if he wished to go back to the Turkish days I could go as far back as Persian days in Bahrain. I also said that there were other matters concerning the Bahrain boundaries which were in the melting pot. Finally the Shaikh said that his claim was that 'he should have' - I could not get a clearer Arabic expression out of him - 'the port of Zubara territory, the houses in Zubara and the Lisha, and Halwan and Um- Saicha and Um-Alma and the mosques and the graveyards and his freedom and that of his people on the sea coast from A1 Arish to Um Alma and in the desert of the land without interference. A few days later -the Shaikh called on me and informed me that the Shaikh of Qatar had sent over Bin Omran, the Qatar Director of Customs, with friendly letters from himself and his son Hamad to the Shaikh of Bahrain* He did not show me the letters arid I said that they were a good sign and asked what more the Shaikh wanted. He replied that the letters were warm in words but cold in heart. I believe the Shaikh v/ishes concrete rights in the port of Zubara which he may think will be developed , as a landing port between Bahrain and Qatar. The case still rests with the Resident's (Colonel Hay's) statement to Shaikh Salman that he will tour to Zubara this cold weather. (SGD.) A.C.GALLOWAY. 11-11-46.Translation of letter No.35/1366, dated the 10th tniharrara, 1366 (2.12. f 46), from His Highness the Ruler of Bahrain, to Lt-Col. A.C. Galloway, political Agent, Bahrain. I inform you that last year I received information that one of our subjects from Al-Bu-Romaih tribe went to Shaikh of Qatar for an agreement (permission) for them to go to Qatar together with their families and boats which have been registered in Bahrain, but that (information) could not be properly confirmed to me. These days, some 20 days ago, some of them (Al-Bu-Rumaih) went to Shaikh of Qatar asking him to settle (them) at Qatar. Twelve days ago they went from our village ummul-IIasam in four boats to Bander Ummul-ttaa, which is one of the ports belonging to our State Zobarah. This latter has been under our disposal since a long time. They landed there with their luggage with the intention of settling there. As your Honour is aware that this port is one of our properties ; that they went without our consent and that the Shaikh of Qatar has settled them in it (Bander Ummul Maa), to which we do not agree. Firstly: that it is our port, and since a long time no one Secondly: that they went without our consent, so we request A.C has been settling in it without our consent.

I enclose a copy of a translation of a letter from the Shaikh of Bahrain which I received on the 11th December, 1946. 2. I have discussed the migration with the ShaiKh of Bahrain who states that while he does not mind these people leaving Bahrain, he objects to their being settled by the shaiKh of i^atar on land which he claims to be his in vjatar. 3 # While, of course, it is not admitted that Umm al Ma’a belongs to the Shaikh of Bahrain, the rights to the coast line in the Zubarah region have for long been under dispute. I think that for the shaikh of Qatar to settle Bahrainis, as is alleged by the shaikh of Bahrain, at Umm al Ma f a is offensive to the latter and is also not in keeping with the 1944 Agreement. 4 . I am not fully aware of the cause of the trouble between the Shaikh of Bahrain and the emigrants, but understand that some question of a marriage and non payment of a subsidy was involved. 5 . Similar migrations have resulted in more than one serious incident in the past, and I therefore think that we should take notice of this case. Besides which our reaction is probably being watched closely by the Shaikh of Qatar, whether or not he is behind the migration as implied by the Shaikh of Bahrain. 6. I therefore suggest that I should write to the Shaikh of Qatar informing him of the sense of paragraph 3 above, and ask him to settle the families away from the dis puted area. Settlements in that area have in the past been a source of considerable trouble to His lajesty’s Government and they do not wish to run the risk of a recurrence. 7. i should be grateful for early instructions..

After compliments: I inform you that we received information last year to the effect that one of our subjects of the Buromaih tribe went to the Shaikh of Qatar to make an agreement for the tribe to migrate to Qatar and settle there with their families and boats, which latter have been registered in Bahrain. This information has not properly been confirmed to us. Recently, 20 days ago, some of them did go to the Shaikh of Qatar asking him to settle them in Qatar. Twelve days ago they moved in four boats from our village Utamul-Hasam and went to Bander ummul Maa, which is one of the ports belonging to Zobara, which has been under our disposal since a long time. They landed there and unloaded their luggage with the intention of settling. Your Honour is aware that this port belongs to Zobara, and that they went without our consent, where the Shaikh of Qatar has (allowed them) to settle. *Ye do not approve of it: Firstly: that it is one of Zobara's ports, where, for a long time, no one might live without our consent, and for which we possess title-deeds which you have seen on the day of our interview with you. Secondly: that they went without our consent, so we request their removal from those places and properties which we regard specially. Usual ending.D*0. NO.C/14 The 5th of January, 1947 £ My dear Colonel Hay Will you please refer to the cor udence ending with ay Express Letter M o.C/1376'dated the 14th December, 1946? Issue, I have prepared a note summarising the history of zubarah and the case which has arisen over it. I do not claim that it contains all points,, but it should be fairly accurate. I hope you may find it of use. be hoped for is that the two parties should agree to differ. As time has passed relations with Qatar have become easier, and although Shaikh Salman misses no opportunity of having a dig at Qatar, in fact communications are more open. To negotiate further might add fuel to the fire, and must involve the fort at Murair over which the shaikh of Qatar is likely to prove adamant. since we did not object to its cons true tion^ it would be difficult now to as*, him to abandon it, and^should have to find a quid pro quo which would be difficult, if not impossible. 4. only this morning Shaikh Salman was requesting a settlement of his claim and a reply to his letter dated the 21st May, 1946, failing that he asked if he might refer the question to a committee of Arab Rulers. This was a new move but I replied that the matter was under action. Whatever may be decided in this case, we shall always have to face the obsession over Zubarah which domi nates not only Shaikh Salman but the whole of the Al Khalifah. Neither is the Shaikh of Qatar at all likely to retreat willingly from the position he has achieved. 2 in order to clear the position on the Zubarah 3 With regard to a modus vivendl, the most that can yours sincerely, fte Hon’ble Lt-Col.

Abdullah bin Ahmad of Bahrain began to rebuild Zubarah which was then entirely deserted. 7. in 1843 Mohd. bin Khalifah bin Salman returned to Bahrain from Qatar, expelled Shaikh Abdullah, and became Ruler of Bahrain. 8. 1867. Treacherous and destructive raid by the ShuiKns of Bahrain and Abu Dhabi on Dohah and Wakra. 9. By 1868 the Al Than! had risen to predominant power in Qatar, how is not known. 10. 1868. Mohd. bin Khalifah removed from Bahrain by His Majesty’s Government. Isa bin Ali came over from Qatar where he had been residing and was installed Ruler in Bahrain without assistance from His Majesty’s Government. He remained Shaikh of Bahrain for 60 years*. 11. The Political Resident admonished the Shaikhs of Qatar for perpetrating a counter raid. He accepted their plea of retaliation. 12. 1869. Muhammad bin Thani and other Qatar shaikhs agreed that the political Resident should determine what tribute, if any, was due from them to Bahrain and to pay it through the Residency. political Resident recognised that the Shaikh of Bahrain had certain pasturage rights on the Qatari Coast. 13. 1871. Turks established themselves at El Bida fort. Mohd. bin Thani sent an agent to the Naim tribe, and made an amicable settlement with them by which some of the tribe settled at El Bida under the Turkish flag. 14. 1872. Turks occupied Dohah. 15* 1872. Shaikh Isa of Bahrain wished to establish a garrison at zubarah for the protection of the Naim, but the Political Resident advised him to remain neutral to avoid the Al Khalifah’s becoming entangled with the Turks. (Political Resident reported to Government of India that the Shaikh had not the power to control the Qatar tribes). 16* 1873. The Government of India agreed that the Shaikh 1 of Bahrain had no clear or important rights in Qatar. I 17. 1875. The Government of India instructed the politicali Resident to advise the Shaikh of Bahrain that he should not interfere on the mainland. In March 1875 Shaikh Isa replied .........- 2 - to the Political Resident’s letter saying that he would Terrain from interfering on the mainland ”except our city Zubarah for that is our property and has been”* The poli tical Resident wrote saying that reports he had received showed an increased necessity for “avoidance of all inter ference on the mainland (whether at Zubarah or any other place no exception is made)”. The Government of India instructed the political Resident to make the Shaikh understand clearly that if he persisted in entangling himself in mainland affairs they would hold themselves free to take such action with respect to him as they considered necessary. 18. In 1878 the inhabitants of Zubarah committed a heinous piracy in consequence of which the Government of India instructed the political Resident to demand of the Turks that the place should be punished and to offer British naval assistance, in the meantime Shaikh Jassim Al Thani of Dohah had sacked Zubarah. Sheikh Isa of Bahrain requested British help for the Naim at Zubarah. This was refused and the homeless Naim* to the number of about 300, took refuge in Bahrain. In 1886 the Naim of Qatar received large payments from the Bahrain revenues, but the tribe failed to give any adequate return. 19. In 1888 the British Government fearing that the Turks would connive at the rebuilding of Zubarah informed Shaikh Jasim Al Than! that a settlement by him would not be permitted, in this and the following year ’a considerable migration of Naim from Qatar to Bahrain took place. A vague treaty of amity was concluded between the Shaikh of Bahrain and Jassim of Dohah. 20. 1890. Shaikh Jasim Al Thani endeavoured to induce the Turks to establish a garrison at Zubarah. 21. In 1890 the Turks were reported to be considering the appointment of a Turkish MUdir for Zubarah. one was appointed by 1895. 22. 1895. The Al bin Ali, a discontented Bahrain tribe, migrated from Bahrain to Qatar, where, with the consent and support of Shaikh Jasim Al Thani they formed a settle ment at Zubarah. A Commander Pelly was sent to Zubarah to demand the return of the Al bin Ali. He met with a refusal on the grounds that they were Turkish subjects and the place a Turkish possession. From this incident a serious threat to Bahrain was checked by Commander pelly who again visited Zubarah and destroyed 44 armed vessels there. Under the peace arrangements the Al bin Ali returned to Bahrain. 23. in 1895 the Shaikh of Bahrain was informed that he had received the final decision of the Government of India, and that the question of his right to interfere in affairs on the mainland could not well be referred again; it behovedj him carefully to consider his present position and the modi- \ fications it might occasion. * 1 24. In 1895 Jasim Al Than! wrote to the heads of the Naira /tribe-3 tribe, and offered them the choice of war to the death, removttl to Bahrain, or subjection to his authority^ Those members of the tribe residing at Zubarah thereupon made overtures to Muhammad bin Thani of Bida and asked to be allowed to ^transfer their allegiance to him”. 25. Later in 1895 His Majesty’s Government informed the porte that they could not permit the Zubarah coast to be considered to lie within Turkish jurisdiction. 26. In 1896 friendly relations with Qatar were restored and the re-opening of trade notified in the bazaars. 27. . 1903. A Turkish gunboat left Basra to assist in the axkakidbdouu establishment of guard houses to connect Zubarah and Odaid. The Mudir designate for Zubarah arrived in Hasa in this year, but the porte assured His Majesty’s Government later that they had no intention of posting a* Mudir for Zubarah./ 28. in 1913 by Article ll of the Anglo-Turkish convention His Majesty’s Government undertook to prevent the Shaikh of Bahrain from interfering in any way in the mainland of Qatar. 29. In 1915 the Turks abandoned Dohah. 30. In 1916 an agreement was signed between His Majesty’s Government and ’’the shaikh of Qatar” by which the latter bound himself to fulfil the various obligations already undertaken by the Trucial Shaikhs, and His Majesty’s Govern ment undertook to protect him from aggression by sea. 31. In 1922 the shaikh of Qatar desired to enter into some closer agreement with His Majesty’s Government but the Govern ment of India were averse to undertaking liability for his defence against rebellious subjects or invaders from inland. 32. In 1930 the shaikh again proposed a closer form of agree ment, and met with a second refusal. • 33. In 1935 the shaikh of Qatar gave an oil concession to the Anglo-Iranian oil company enabling them to operate 'throughout the principality of Qatar”. This agreement was followed by a ’’political” agreement between His Majesty's Govern ment and the Anglo-iranian Oil company. 34. Zubarah remains almost deserted though tribesmen grazed their flock in that area and members of the Al Khalifah went there on hunting trips from Bahrain. Communications between Bahrain and Zubara continued until 1937. Helations with the Shaikh of Qatar and Bahrain were outwardly friendly. 35. in 1937 the shaikh of Bahrain received offers from the Bahrain petroleum company, Limited, and petroleum Concessions Limited for the ’’Additional Area”. The Hawar Islands and other shoals and islands near Qatar were claimed by Bahrain, and the shaikh of Bahrain reported to the Political Agent that the shaikh of Qatar had visited zubarah. in 1938 His Majesty’s Government seemed to have been of the opinion that the award of Hawar to Bahrain should be balanced by the award of Zubarah to Qatar (vide paragraph 6 of Sir Trenchard powle’s note forming enclosure to India Office complimentary slip No. P.Z.2904/1938 dated the 30th April, 1938). / 36 . m. • . . .36. In 1937 two factions of the fcaim residing in the Zubarah area quarreled over a woman and one faction 'appealed' to the Shaikh of qatar. The shaikh possibly Influenced by the activities of petroleum concessions Limited and wishing to demonstrate his authority informed the head of the Naim at Zubarah that he should swear loyalty to him or be punished, lie also threatened to tax the r:aiiii. The head of the Naim appealed to the Shaikh of Bahrain for assistance, who thereupon sent three Bahrain guards to plant the Al Khalifah flag at Zubarah. He also ordered repairs to the fort. The Shaikh of i t atar protested to the political Agent who, after consulting the political Resident asked the wShalkh of Bahrain to remove his guards ahd close down the repair work. Two days after writing this letter the political Agent visited Zubarah, and found the guards still there. He wrote to the Adviser requesting him to ask the Shaikh to issue orders for the withdrawal of the guards, vide Agency letter No.c/*533-4/13 dated the 3rd of May, 1937. 37. The political Resident advised negotiations between representatives of the shaikhs of Bahrain and n atar. These took place in Bahrain over a considerable period of time. The qatar representatives were Nasir bin ♦Atiah and zaleh al Manah. They broke down because the Zhaikh of Bahrain found himself unable to withdraw his claim to Zubarah. He agreed, however, not to press his claim to zubarah and to his authority over the Naim provided the Shaikh of qatar would agree not to tax the Naim and 'to preserve the condition of Zuburah as it was before che dispute'. Later a meeting between relatives of the two Shaikhs was arranged and Shaikh Abdullah (brother of the late Hamad) and Salman (the present shaikh of Bahrain) proceeded to a rendezvous near Zubarah. MX*. Belgrave accompanied the party. The qatar representatives were Shaikhs Hamad bin Abdullah and Ali bin Jassim, a brother of Shaikh Abdullah. No progress was made and after four days the Bahrain party retired. bile the launch was passing Zubarah the party actually saw shaikh Abdullah's,? 4 : force indulge in an attack on the Naim. The Shaikh of 1 o\\ r Bahrain complained to the political Agent that the Zhaikh of .^atar was oppressing the Naira while the 3haiKh of qatar • that the Shaikh of Bahrain was sending the Naim arms and provisions (vide Agency P«L. No.0/500-4/13 dated 2.7.1937). 38. All normal communications between Bahrain and Jatar remained closed until 1944. A few of the Naim crossed over to Bahrain, but most of them remained in Qatar and submitted to shaikh Abdullah (vide correspondence ending with Residency printed letter No.53B-S dated the L3th July, 1937). 39. on the 6th July, 1937, the Zhaikh of Bahrain enquired when his claim to Zubarah would be considered. He expressed his desire to consult solicitors in London and employ counsel * in this connection and, if necessary, to send a representative to Europe. He was informed that His Majesty's Government was always ready to listen to any representations on any matter which affected his interests, but that his father had been informed as long ago as 1875 that he should dissever /himself-5- himself entirely from the affairs of Qatar including Zubarah, and that His Majesty*s Government were not pre pared to intervene between the Shaikh of Qatar and the Naim tribe (vide correspondence ending with Residency telegram No.751 dated the 17th July, 1937). About this period the Shaikh of Qatar built a new fort a few hundred yards from the old fort which he used as material for it. The Shaikh of Bahrain protested to the Political Agent, but the latter, after consulting the poli tical Resident, did not reply to the Shaikh’s letter, (^ide Residency Memorandum No.477-S dated the 10th April, 1939)• p ■ V * s \ 40. In 1944, *he political Agent effected an agreement ' by which the two Rulers agreed ”to the restoration of friendly arrangements between then as they were in the . • past’*. The Ruler of Qatar undertook that Zubarah should remain in the same state as in the past. (Vide Agency ^ f ■ Ty Printed Letter No.C/939 dated the 19th June, 1944). ^ The Shaikh of Bahrain showed some reluctance in signing the agreement whereupon the political Agent wrote an explanatory letter to him stating that the Shaikh of Qatar was anxious for the restoration of friendship and £x±4x friendly communications to the state ante 1936^ a copy of this letter was not sent to the Shaikh of Qauar. ^ Soon after the Agreement had been signed the Shaikh of Bahrain wrote to the political Agent drawing his attention to the fact that the fort built by the Shaikh of Qatar had not existed ante 1936 and asserting that he (the Political Agent) had promised that the position at Zubarah should be restored to its past state and that he had not done this. The shaikh also asked for the return of the arms taken from the Naim in 1937 by the Shaikh of Qatar. The political Agent replied denying that he had made any promises ’’either in regard to the restoration of the position to what it was in the past or with regard to the return of arras”. He pointed out that from the phrase ”The Ruler of Qatar teswfre undertakes that Zubarah will remain without anything being done in it which did not exist in the past”, it did not appear ’’that anything is required to be changed which existed at the time of the Agreement but rather that there should be no new innovation”. The political Agent added that he would use his personal endeavours to arrange for the withdrawal of the garrison of the Zubarah fort and for the return of the whole or some part of the arms. (Vide Agency printed Letter No.1380 dated the 25th September, 1944). . The Shaikh of Bahrain wrote again to the effect that the fort was a source of humiliation to the Al Khalifah when they visited Zubarah, and again asserted that the political Agent had ’promised* to arrange for the removal of the fort and the guards, and asked him to fulfil his promise. If the political Agent were unable to arrange this the Shaikh of Bahrain wished to know whether there was any objection to his taking up the question directly with the Shaikh of Qatar. He added that if the Shaikh of Qatar insisted on maintaining the fort and the guard he would close communications with Qatar. The Political Agent again denied that he had made any promise, and referred the matter to the Political Resident (vide Agency letters Nos. c/1424 and C/1425 dated the 4th October, 1944). /On the......../of•«.«.... - 6 - |? ^ u v 41. on the 2nd December Saleh al Mana*, the Shaikh of ^atar*s secretary, informed the political Agent that the Shaikh of Qatar was willing to withdraw the guards. The Political Agent replied that the Shaikh of Qatar should do so and inform him when this had been done. (Vide Agency printed Letter No.C/1917 dated the 24th December, 1944). 42. On the 10th December, 1944, the Shaikh of Bahrain wrote to the shaikh of Qatar that, in view of the recent agreement, he considered the situation to be 'as it was before the dispute took place'. The Shaikh of Qatar replied that he would be governed by the terms of the Agreement &gt; under reference. (Vide Agency P.L* No.C/1789 dated the 18th December, 1944). The messenger of the Shaikh of Bahrain who carried his letter to Qatar also discussed the possible return of the arms taken from the Naim. The Shaikh of Qatar is reported to have said that, he was agreeable to return them if the shaikh of Bahrain would make a written request. He also informed the messenger that under the 1916 Treaty with His Majesty's Government he could not alienate any part of Qatar and was, therefore, unable to recognise the Al Khalifah claim to Zubarah. (Vide Agency letter No.c/1915 dated the 20th December 1944). 43. ^I On the 13th January, 1945, the Shaikh of Bahrain asked the political Agent to inform the Shaikh of Qatar that His Majesty's Government had no objection to his negotiating direct for the removal of the guards. The Political Agent thereupon suggested to the political Resident that he.should express a hope that the Shaikh of Qatar had by now removed the guards, and should add that any outstanding questions should be dealt with direct by the two Shaikhs. The political Resident agreed and left it to the political Agent's discretion to advise the Shaikh of Bahrain verbally that discussion should be con- . fined to the specific question of the withdrawal‘of the guards (vide Residency telegram No.113 dated 16.1.1945). /, 44. On the 22nd January, 1945, the political Agent wrote to the Shaikh of Qatar and replied to Shaikh Salman that the Shaikh of Qatar had been informed ’'that there is no objection to discussing the question of the Zubarah r guards directly with Your Highness'. . , 45. On the 24th January, 1945, the Shaikh of Bahrain wrote to the shaikh of Qatar saying that in the past the Shaikh of Qatar had neither a fort nor a garrison 'in my country Zubarah', and asked him to restore the situation to its former state and also to return the arms taken from the Naim. (Agency Endorsement no.C/ 168 dated 3.2.*45). On the 30th January the Shaikh of Qatar replied that he was surprised to see the Shaikh of Bahrain speaking of Zubarah as his country which 'as everybody knows it is an inseparable part of Qatar', and that if he wanted the arms back 'in the form of a request, that is a separate question'. On the 1st February, 1945, the Shaikh of Qatar replied to the political Agent's letter that he had with drawn the guards and there were now only some two or three caretakers left in the fort. The Shaikh of Bahrain there upon wrote to the Political Agent saying that Zubarah had belonged to the Al Khalifah up to the 1937 dispute, and that 'all the people of the Gulf know that Zubarah is one-7- # of the Al Khalifah properties in the past and future”. (Vide Agency P.L. No.C/235 dated the 12th February, 1945). 46. The Shaikh of Bahrain asked the political Agent whether he should reply to the Shaikh of Qatar's letter and whether, if he did not do so it could beheld that he had accepted the claims made therein. fhe political Agent advised him against replying, and gave it as his opinion that such a view could not be held. 47. On the 22nd January, after consulting the political Agent, the Shaikh of Bahrain ordered some 20 of the Naim who had settled in Bahain to proceed to Qatar with their fanilies and their cattle. They landed at Zubarah on the 23rd, spent the night there, and moved on to T iilwan. On the fourth day of their stay at Hilwan, one of the Shaikh of Qatar's arms-smuggling patrols informed them that they must move inland, and that they could not now leave Qatar without an exit permit and must pay duty on any coranodities received from Bahrain. The Shaikh of Bahrain complained to the political Agent who replied, after consulting the political Resident, that the Political Resident had never supported the Shaikh of Bahrain's claim to the Zubarah area, and that he was at liberty to take the matter up with the Shaikh of Qatar direct. (Vide Agency printed Letter No.C/366 dated the 15th Larch, 1945). f 'V f h 48. The Shaikh of Bahrain did not take the matter up with the Shaikh of Qatar,, but continued to make recurrent complaints to the political Agent (a) that the Bahrainis sent to Qatar were ordered to move away from the Zubarah area and threatened with the cutting of their tent ropes if they did not move, (b) that they must pay duty on their supplies from Bahrain, (c) that Bahrainis going to the western* coast of Qatar to collect lime were turned back by the Shaikh of Qatar's patrols and sometimes ill-treated (vide Agency D.O. No.P.12 dated 23rd August, 1945), and (d) that Bahraini boats were charged harbour.fees at Qatar ports. (In fact a tax on the export of juss which had previously been imposed by the Shaikh of Qatar - cf. Agency telegram No.84 dated tne 23rd April, 1937)* ! 49. On the 21st Hay, 1946, the Shaikh of Bahrain wrote to tne political Agent referring briefly to the events leading up to the 1944 Agreement and contending chat while he had kept to it and allowed Qataris to visit Bahrain, the position at Zubarah had not been restored to that prior to the 1937 trouble. (Vide Agency letter No.c/622 dated 11.6.1946). v 50. In July, 1946, the politicalAgent visited Qatar. He discussed the question of visits'by the Al Khalifah and Bahrainis to Qatar with the Shaikh of Qatar who said that the Al Khalifah would be most welcome but shoxlhxwxfltiuw should send previous intimation of their coming and that Bahrainis visiting Qatar would be accorded the same treatment as Qataris visiting Bahrain (Vide Agency letter ro.c/733 dated the 11th July, 1946.No.c/16.

A further point which is now confirmed is that the shaikh of Bahrain himself is not acting upon the terms of the Agreement of 1944. Recently he has for bidden the export of lorries (3 in number I think) to gatar. This is in contravention of the Agreement since Qatar should be entitled to the benefits of R.E. 3. I tackled the Shaikh on the subject and he replied that any article for P.C.L. itself would be subjected to no restrictions, but that for Qatar sub jects he proposed to maintain an embargo pending a settlement of the zubarah dispute. He said that he regarded the prevention of the export of lorries with particular importance because it was by means of lorries that *his people* were attached at Zubarah. This is rather childish, but his whole attitude is impossible over the present dispute. 4. Actually the situation in Zubarah itself has slightly improved for I understand that the zhaikh of Qatar has sent an official with a representative of the Shaikh of Bahrain and has publicly told villagers and nomads in the Zubarah area that they will be left in peace and that they way import food from Bahrain free from payment of dues. The Shaikh of Bahrain has not admitted this to me because, and I presume that he prefers to maintain his attitude that all that he does is rignt, and all that Abdullah does is wicked. 5. This morning the shaikh attacked me from a new angle, and pointed out that for old friends like the Al Khalifah His Majesty’s Government did nothing to assist in obtaining their rights for them, but for Arabs newly settled in a territory we did everything. The raising of the status of the ex-Amir of Trans Jordan to that of King seemed particularly aggravating and Glubb came in for much praise as an efficient Adviser. At first I thought that the Shaikh was striking out towards a revision of his treaties, but on enquiry I learnt that this was not the case, and that Zubarah was being pressed once again. Nevertheless the point is of interest and shows a working of the Shaiicii , s mind. 6. As regards re-export of P.C.L. equipment, I am discussing the point with Lermitte. yours sincerely, Phe Hon*ble Lt-Col. W.R. Hay, C.o.X*, C.I.Ij., political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bahrain.v\*&gt;; 19/243. I visited Zubarah with Political Agent, Bahrain, on January 13th. The ruins of quite a large town stretch along the shore and about a mile inland to the south-east is a substantial fort built by the Shaikh of Qatar a few years ago together with the ruins of a much larger old fort. This site is known as Murair. The new fort is occupied by two natives who locked the door and refused us admission. (We had given the Shaikh of Qatsr no prior notice of our visit). Both inside and outside the old fort there are traces of wells and local Arabs and Lorimer report good water within a few feet of the surface. The boundary walls of fairly extensive gardens still exist to the west of the old fort. We saw two old guns lying about which local Arabs said are 300 years old. They may be evidence of Portuguese occupation. The artificial creek leading up to Murair which is referred to by Lorimer still exists but contains practically no water. We were unable to find any cemetery or any traces of the alleged graves of Shaikh Salman’s ancestors. Rain had fallen recnetly and two Arabs (Qatar subjects) whom we saw said there would be good grazing in fifteen days* time. Apart from the natives in the new fort there was no evidence of any local habitation. ltd. W. R. H. 16 . 1 .* 47 . CONFIDENT IAL No. 118 - S. PERSIAN GULF RESIDENCY, BAHRAIN. the 17th January, 1947.

If he wishes to pursue a claim to the ownership of Zubarah, which is presumably what he means, he should put in a formal and detailed representa tion for transmission to His Majesty’s Government. I trust however that you will do your best to discourage him from submitting such a claim. 5. If the Shaikh wishes to repudiate the agree ment which he signed on 23rd June 1944 on the grounds that he did not fully understand its contents, I should see no grave objection, and we should be relieved of a certain amount of embarrassment. On the other hand it is desirable if possible to avoid a return to the state of blockade which existed between Bahrain and Qatar before the agreement. ieut.-Colonel A.C. Galloway, CIE., OBE., Political Agent, Bahrain. NPG Coribdcuti&amp;L BAHRAIN RECEIPT. N«... Date.DRAFT LETTER FROM POLITICAL AGENT BAHRAIN TO HIS HIGHNESS THE SHAIKH OF BAHRAIN. I have the honour to reply to the letter which Your Highness addressed to me on the 25th May 1946 on the subject of Zubarah. unable to reply to this letter before. The reason was that I considered it necessary to consult the Hon*ble the instructions before replying, and as Colonel Hay had only recently assumed charge as Political Resident he wished to study all the papers about this complicated question and visit Zubarah itself before expressing any opinion regarding it. He has now authorised me to reply to you as follows. 3. It is true that the agree- ment with the Shaikh of Qatar which Your Highness signed on the 23rd June &gt; 1944,was effected as a result of the mediation of Major Hickinbotham who was then Political Agent Bahrain and it is 1 ) to be presumed therefore that Major Hickinbotham knew what the words used were meant to convey. With regard to the interpretation of the clause which Your Highness quotes, viz., 'The Ruler of Qatar undertakes that Zubarah will remain without anything being done in it which did not exist in the past', Major Hickinbotham has himself in his letter everything is to be restored in Zubarah 2 I regret that I have been Political Resident and obtain his No.C/1372 dated 23rd September 1944 said that this does not mean that1 \ 1 % - 2 - as it was in 1936., but that there shall be no innovation after the signing of the agreement. The Political Resident and I recently visited Zubarah and so far as we can see there has certainly been no innovation ? and apart from the Shaikh of Qatar’s fort at Murair the whole place is ruined and deserted. The fort in question was built several years before the agreement of 1944^and the Shaikh of Qatar cannot be called upon to destroy it under the. agreement, in accordance with the interpretation given above. Major Hickinbotham was however successful in persuading the Shaikh of Qatar to withdraw the garrison^ and when we visited the place it was occupied by only two naturs. 4. I have made enquiries into complaints received from Your Highness from time to time,and have been unable to obtain any clear evidence that the Shaikh of Qatar is persecuting your subjects or imposing more restrictions on them than on other foreigners entering his country. When Your Highness* subjects enter Qatar they must naturally expect to be called upon to comply with the laws of the country in the same way as Qatar subjects have to observe Your Highness' laws and regulations when they visit Bahrain. 5. In the circumstances explained there appears to be nothingto substantiate Your Highness’ complaint that Shaikh Abdullah is not observing his side of the^agreement and there are ncr grounds for making any protest to him. A r 6. In conclusion I wish to n.ir^xl assure Your Highness that I always do my best to persuade the Shaikh of Qatar to observe the terms of tne agree ment should there be any evidence that he is failing to do so. At t^e same time I hope Your Highness will observe your side of the agreement^and do your best to maintain good relations with Qatar, and avoid a return to the state of affairs which existed before 1944.II \ J J I ^ * ^ AY / *) ^Vl^tr_niY jJjJir ^ J« Ijl 5 ^lTV I ^ aUI^ * ^&gt;W J wi^J ^J^rUl «&lt;t oil I . &amp; %tiitl) ^ imI ajuL-^JI »A*kS*- &lt; ^y « l a5 u *UI (w 'Is' : ~ x: S&lt;X w &gt; 4 'cf Itofi ^ jUy^l ,m%2j C * T &gt;** ^ .Jr-L—Jl ^«fU ,%&amp; *K» C ^l—-- JL • b *&amp; U»L^t&gt;d •» a» y&gt;fC^ol3 ^3j 4 c4£U}I t ' 3 Iv^oW fyv'o' c^ ' ^JW Jt • Cf l&gt;l^jl ^j|a %+*,&amp;&gt; fj3\ u \j&amp; • f** **i Si^Ai- ^ ho.

It is clear that these people have left Bahrain, but I am not actually aware if they are at Umra al toaa or not. Your Excellency is fully aware that much of the trouble between Bahrain and Qatar in the past has arisen from the migration and movements of tribesmen with their families between the north-western coast of Qatar and Bahrain. His Majesty's Government have been at great pains lit —l past to assist in the settlement of these troubles and in order to avoid a recrudescence, and for the benefit of all parties, I have to ask you to prevent the establishment of the Al-3u- homaih on the north-western shores of Qatar.-3- P Zi —T_ —J j ^Ct —‘■“0'’ v A &lt;3 U l ^ jju51c^l«A*a— U o-p * y^oW ^ oW t&gt;f ^ ♦v *-3W g * * • er —^«ft)Ua l»£lfjH'4^t ^5JI 0 I Jt ^ 0* 4--jW «Utu-&lt;* 'ij i—^Uz’; ^ ^lr%i&gt;»l A i .1*1 ^ t't 4JT ff 0 l ^1 f fcpJI c6 #A J*AfL— W1 j ,j^W h &gt;—- opU j j- 1 * 3 cr^ ^ * dJjg ad J*^ ^ a l/fAffi 1^ f+&amp;T cul£&gt;U ije ^Is* J})\ \)*+r+Zj • \ 1 i I Jf5 plaints received from Your Highness from time to time, and have been unable to obtain any clear evidence that the Shaikh of ^atar is persecuting your subjects or imposing more restrictions on them than on other foreigners entering his country.

After compliments: February, 1947, (26th Rabi Awwal 1366), in reply to our letter in paragraph 3, Your Excellency referred to the agreement concluded between us and the Shaikh of Qatar through the media tion of the political Agent, saying that the political Agent knew the meaning of the agreement as denoting, as per his letter d^ated the 23rd of September, 1944: 'It does not mean that everything to be restored as it was before 1936'. in his letter No. C/958, dated the 21st June, 1944 (30th Jamada-al- Thani, 1363) the political Agent stressed on the restoration of friendly relations between Bahrain and Qatar as they were before 1936. You may please refer to that letter. Also refer to Major Hickinbotham’s letter dated 30th May. 1944, sent to 'I have now received a letter from the Residency Agent which makes the Shaikh of Qatar’s view quite clear. He is quite prepared to restore relations with Bahrain and to acknow ledge the rights of the Al Fhalifah to Qasr-al-Murair and Zubarah but he is not prepared to allow any building to take place in these places. Further, he will be very willing for the Al Khalifah to make use of Qatar territory in the same way and for the same purposes as they did before relations became strained. This seems to me to be a very reasonable attitude and I feel that His Highness could accept the suggestion without any loss of prestige to himself or his family, and with con siderable material gain'. As Your Excellency is aware, before 1936, we and our subjects enjoyed privilege and freedom in those parts which other Qatar’s residents did not. This was very old and it goes back 200 years when we were there, and after that our followers remained in those areas which were under our control. I have received your 'kind letter no. the 16th of 25th May, 1946, on the subject of zubarah. r /As regards...- 2 - As regards the Shaikh of Qatar's claim that he has been observing the agreement. I should like you to refer to the poli tical Agent's letter tlo.c/2-9 dated the 1st March, 1945, (16th Rabi Awwal 1366), and also to the political Agent’s letter No. C/775 dated the 14th August,' 1945 (27th Sha'ban 1364) to the Shaikh of Qatar, in which he told him to avoid frictions between Bahrain and Qatar. Also see our letter to the political Agent dated the 1st May, 1945, (19th Jamad Awwal 1364) and our letter dated 22nd February, 1945 (9th Rabi Awwal, 1364). O' Your Excellency.’ All this happened after the signing of the Agreement, V, \ $A which shows that he is working against it. • vou have kindly said that the Hon'ble the political Resi dent and you visited Zubarah, and apart from the fort you found nothing. I inform you that this fort was built during the trouble, and it did not previously exist in that region. As regards the ruined places, we have clear proofs that the shaikh of Qatar's officials did much damage to our houses and the Habit able places, vide evidence enclosed. in paragraph 4, Your Excellency said that the complaints received from us were not clear in respect of the persecution of our subjects in those places. tfe and our subjects enjoyed, as previously said, an ancient privilege, and no one used to interfere with us in those parts. In paragraph 5, you said that it did not appear to you that the Shaikh of Qatar was not observing the Agreement, and that there are sufficient grounds (sic). Please God, after you have referred to the above mentioned letters, you will find the grounds. I forward you the evidence which affirms to Y°ur Excellency that we and our subjects and our freedom of movements were not interfered with by anyone in those parts, and no one was objecting to our goings and comings and to the foods belonging to us and our followers, which fact is well known by all the residents of Qatar.

I fully appreciate your interest in your efforts to improve relations among neighbouring States, for which efforts I am sure you will be ^Exa&amp;Kd praised because of your intention to take into consideration the interest of both parties. For this, you deserve the best thanks and the highest con sideration. But you are fully aware that I have done my best to achieve this object and carried out all in my power to link up the ties of unity and friendliness. But have such efforts been expended by the other party? O' Your Excellency, you realise that the pressure exerted by Bahrain on Qatar is very severe, and it has been increasing in severity. Qatar subjects are facing difficulties which are not present in other cases. They do not receive in Bahrain the same facilities as other countries have been receiving to the extent that the transhipments granted to others are refused to them, and the goods destined for abroad are not allowed (shipment) for Qatar at a time when they are allowed for any destination. All this implies that the Bahrain attitude towards us is not friendly. Besides. Bahrain has opened its gates to all those persons who would come to it from the Qatar peoples and tribes, welcoming them and endeavouring by every way of enticement and propaganda, while we are keeping patience, and because of our good intention, and our appreciation of the freedom of the indi viduals, we have not complained to Your Excellency. As regards what Shaikh Salman has told you about the al-Bu-Rumaih, Your Excellency is aware that they have emigrated from Bahrain with the knowledge, consent and permission of shaikh Salman, and without our asking or inviting them; nor had we any knowledge about them. They arrived in Qatar as guests, and Your Excellency understands the Arab customs and their usual practices, such as welcome and hospitality. And when they expressed their desire to settle, we did not consider it proper to shut the door in the face of a noble tribe arrived as a guest. In pursuance of the customs, we have allowed them to settle like other settlers, without meaning any harm. By my doing so I cannot find any cause to trouble Shaikh Salman, so long as he himself had allowed them to migrate. We are in the 20th century, and under the super vision of noblemen who sacrificed their blood for the xxMfi sake of democracy and freedom. If Your Excellency would make enquiries, you would find that some of the Qatar tribes and people left Qatar and settled in Bahrain, where it pleased them to settle and where they were well received, in future, if Shaikh Salman wishes us to adopt a definite procedure necessitated by circumstances, and it be under your supervision, we are prepared to come to an agreement on mutual basis. Should this proposal appeal to your Excellency and Shaikh Salman, I would put up my proposal on which the idea of reciprocality will be based. Usual ending.\ ^ Translation of letter No.454/13‘66 dated the 5th March, 1947, from His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain to the political Agent, Bahrain. After compliments: I inform you that yesterday the 12th of Rabi al-Thani, 1366 (4th March, 1947), one Mr. Lawton, an employee of the Bahrain petroleum company, Limited, Bahrain, accompanied by some sailors went out in seafch of a launch which had broken loose or had been stolen from Sitra pier. He found it with the dwellers of Urn al Ma’a, about whom I have already written to you. They refused to give it back to him, which act leads to harmful (consequences). I have repeatedly put up complaints against the dwellers there. Moreover, it is one of the ports of Zubarah and the settlement of these people in this place tends to lead to the repeti tion of harmful acts and incidents against us. I have no doubt that they stole it. As you are aware these people have settled in those places without our consent. O' Your Excellency, how often aggressions and troubles are done by Qatar people against us, which we refer to t you one after another'? But it is regretted that had action been taken in accordance with justice, there would have been no repetition. The necessary measures should be taken and rules followed. This is our request from Your Excellency and it is the habit of the British Government. NS. Usual ending.t / ,m'-&gt; t) &gt;li 1 ' '■ ^rjiUUliYy-jUl J 'll &gt;:»© 0 No.C/324.

BAHRAIN RECEIPT. —Date....4:Al.A Being desirous of having my launch returned &gt; to Bahrein through official channels, I request your advice and kind assistance. Briefly - will endeavour to give full facts. The launch is British Clinker built 17' x 7 1 x 2' with a single cylinder inboard J.A.P. engine installed. About 11 weeks ago, and during the 'sha'mals” one evening at dusk, the launch broke adrift in my presence while working on my bigger launch recently purchased from the R.A.F. The launch being 200' away when first noticed I was reluctant to swim out to retrieve it, owing to the cold, high wind and darkness. Approximately 4 weeks passed when a Company employee Said bin Shahin (Watchman on the Old Wharf) contacted the Company Security Officer informing him that the above-mentioned launch was seen floating near the village of Hum-mul-mi, ^.utar, and had been pulled ashore by his brother Mohamed bin Ali. By paying (first demand) Rs500, the boat would be brought to Bahrein Island. The Security Officer mentioned Rs200 would be payed as the boat was not salvage. s ome three weeks ago, I myself went to Hum-mul-mi thinking theperson named would release the launch. He stated he was afraid the Sheikh would be angry if he allowed me to take the launch away. Extremely disappointed I returned to Bahrein. Returning from a trip to Shaiba on Company business, an ultimatum had been made: Rs300 or the launch sold in 7 days. Which time had expired before my return. Being quite filling to pay the necessary amount, I would esteem it a favour if you would please advise me what I should do under those unfortunate circumstances.

On 10th Muharram 1366 one of our subjects named Jassem bin Lohammad Alrameehi departed from Bahrain on a registered journ- ney with all his properties and relatives after causing some disturbances in the country.

Yesterday Qassem bin Mohammad and his company who had gone and were forbidden to come to Bahrain if they did not bring their families came to Bahrain. Vve passed orders for them to be arrested and departed to the place he had come from fearing of disturbance in the country; the Assistant Political Agent interfered and wrote to the Adviser of our Government for them to be released on bail. Oh Your \ Honour I see no right for the Assistant to interfere in my country and my subjects. This is a question of my internal rights; I am the Ruler of the country and have the control in my country and do not like the continuance of the Assistant's interference in my internal affairs without any right.

Dear Colonel Hay, The extracts from Ranee’s noting on my file, of which I enclose copies, give the facts of the master about which you asked for a report in your demi-official letter No.699-3, dated the 23rd of April, 1947. ^ .|o0 2. As indicated in our conversation, my comments are:- (i) A matter concerning even indirectly the relations between Bahrain and Qatar cannot be described as merely a question of the Shaikh of Bahrain’s ’’internal rights”; (ii) Ranee’s letter (apart from the fact that it appears to have been suggested by the Shaikh, and certainly was suggested by Belgrave) was a request, and more of a request for a courtesy than anything else. It is ridiculous to describe this as inter ference ”in my country and my subjects”. # (iii) I resent most strongly the Shaikh's action in writing to you without first addressing me. I understood you to say that you were agreeable to replying to his letter by asking him to address me. 3. Would you also please refer to the following extract from the Shaikh’s letter, viz., ’’pleading the Assistant political Agent’s interference with my subjects and country in affairs which do not concern him and which have been brought to your notice”? I should be glad if I could be informed of what other 'interferences” by Ranee have been brought to your notice. 4. The whole tone of the Shaikh's letter and the references to Ranee seem to me to be objectionable. Yours sincerely, 'he Hon’ble Lt-Col. ;V.R.

He replied that H*H. had ordered the arrest and detention of Jasim bin Muhd. I informed the Adviser that I did not wish to go into * the merits of the case at the moment, since it was obviously for you to do that on your return, but I told him I thought that you, as P.A., might well object to the arrest and detention of a messenger from H.E. the Shaikh of Qatar without prior reference to the P.A. The Adviser then said that H.H. had told him before leaving the Adviserate that morning, that the man might be released if the Agency wished this to be done, and the Adviser said this would be done, but suggested I should write to him about it. I made it quite clear to the Adviser that there was no question of my insisting on the man being released, but gave it as my opinion that in the circumstances * it would be desirable.

I have gone carefully into the allega tions made in your Highness’s letter against my Assistant. I find that what happened concerning Jassim bin Mohammed was as follows:- It was reported to my Assistant that t Your Highness had arrested a messenger who had carried a letter from His Excellency the Shaikh of Qatar, to me and who, when arrested, was on his way to this Agency to inquire about a reply to the letter. On hearing this my Assistant asked Your Highness’s Adviser for the facts of the matter. The Adviser confirmed that the messenger had been arrested. My Assistant then told the Adviser that the political Agent might object to the arrest of a messenger to him from the Shiikh of Qatar. The Adviser said that Your Highness had told him that the man might be released if the Agency wished it but he asked my Assistant to write to him about it. My Assistant made it clear that there was no question of his insisting on the man being released.

As the man who was arrested was, of course, one of the Ar Rumaih and his arrest was clearly connected with the Bahrain-Qatar dispute I am unable to understand why it should be des cribed by Your Highness as merely a question of your M internal rights”. It would be perhaps more reasonable to argue that the settlement of the Ar-Rumaih in Qatar was a question of the internal rights of the Shaikh of Qatar, furthermore I am^entirely unable to accept Your High- ness f s description of my Assistant’s request for what was very largely a courtesy 'as an inter ference with your subjects and country. 4.

A/(i) &lt;&amp; Note of an interview between His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain and the political Agent at which Mr. Belgrave, the Adviser to the Bahrain Government, and Captain Ranee were present. ~ m mm ~ mm m* mm ~ I. His Highness expressed his feeling for friendship for and desire for good relations with the political Agent. He stated, however, that the Shaikh of Qatar had caused mis understanding by sending Jassim bin Mohammed to Bahrain, and, inquired whether this man Jassim bin Mohammed was not one of his subjects. The Political Agent pointed out that in his experience of the rulers of the Arab coast he had never seen a letter like that sent by His Highness in reference to the Assistant Political Agent. He pointed out that there was no question of the Assistant Political Agent demanding the release of Jassim bin Mohammed, all he had done was to suggest that the man’s incarceration should be deferred until the Political Agent returned to Bahrain; and he had done this at the sug gestion of His Highness’s Adviser. His Highness could have replied that it was impossible to postpone the arrest of the man, but instead of doing so he wrote a letter to blame not only the interference of the Assistant Political Agent in this case, but in several other instances. This letter made a general accusation, but did not quote instances and when in the political Agent’s letter to the Shaikh he asked for instances he received no reply. The Shaikh replied to this that his relations with the Political Agent were far different and far closer to that between the political Agent and other rulers. He then quoted cases to support his allegation of the Assistant Political Agent's interference, viz.,— -2- (i) two letters regarding the nationality case of Hussain Nama*. (ii) releases of cars for (a) Saleh Al Mana*. (b) Abdulla Darwish (two cars). He added that he was ready enough to release anything required from the island for P.C.L. (even one of His Highness’s own cars, if necessary). U The political Agent pointed out that the Agency was §n office and did not depend upon the personality of the Political Agent or the Assistant Political Agent. Whatever official letters issued from it, issued as Agency letters and whether signed by the Assistant political Agent or by the Political Agent, the latter was responsible for them. r t S The Assistant Political Agent pointed out that the release of the car for Saleh Al Mana’ was from the Qatar quota of cars which came to Qatar through Bahrain. . „ loot The Shaikh referred to the political Agent’s statement in his letter No.C/561, dated the 11th of May, 1947, that he was unwilling to help in the matter of the Ar-Rumaih, and asked if the Political Agent did not help him, who would help him? The political Agent pointed out that he could hardly be expected to help when there was an accusation made by the Shaikh against the Assistant political Agent unsupported by instances. The Shaikh said that if anyone belonging to the Agency, from the Assistant political Agent to a farrash, gave him cause for complaint, he would complain to the Political Agent. As for the Political Agent’s statement that he would not help him, if that was to stand, then, he would not ask for \ help; he had given his reply regarding the allegations about the Assistant political Agent. /The-3- r. The political Agent asked the Assistant political Agent whether he had anything to add. He said that he was satisfied if the political Agent was. It should have been mentioned that when discussing the letter written by His Highness regarding the Assistant political Agent, the'shaikh pointed out that in a previous case when a letter had been written to which the Political Agent (colonel Galloway) took exception, he had withdrawn the words objected to from the letter. It should also be recorded that the political Agent made the point that both letters in the Hussain Nama* case were drafted by the political Agent himself even if signed by the Assistant political Agent.GOVERNMENT OF BAHRAIN.

As I said in my demi-official letter No.c/560, dated the 10th of Fay, 1947, I have never seen such a letter from a Shaikh referring to a political Officer in such terms; and it seems to me to argue a change - and an unfavourable change In the Shaikh’s attitude towards us. This I thought I had already noticed in a few other cases. In that concerning the proposal for a Director of Education, the fact that Kuwait does not have one was quoted as a reason for Bahrain*s refusing one; and again in the discussions concerning the proposed formation of a landing company, Kuwait was quoted: while in one of Ranee's cases about motor cars Belgrave mentioned the Shaikh's belief that the political Agent did rot control their sale in Kuwait. /3. I spoke to, The Hon'ble Lt-Col. W.R. Hay, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, B A H A I N i3. I spoke to Belgrave at some length on the undesirability of regarding Kuwait as an example to be followed since the state of its government is in every respect unworthy of imitation. Belgrave admitted that and said that the Shaikh was aware of it, but on ray suggesting it to him he agreed that the Shaikh M sometimes ,, chafed at our control. 4. However we regard it, and however the general public regard it, I believe that the Arab rulers in this Agency who think about these subjects at all (and in that category I include the Shaikh of Bahrain) look upon our policy in Egypt, kxxtcxxxxK and India as recessive; and as they would never recede themselves unless forced to, they believe that we are acting through weakness.

Dear Sir Rupert, I am afraid I have not issued the reply to the Shaikh's letter a copy of which was forwarded with Bahrain • Agency Memorandum No.c/16, dated the 5th of January, 1947, which was approved in your demi-official letter No.1079-3, dated the 4th June, 1947. The reason for this is that •$*! . having heard the Shaikh of Qatar on the subject of the emigration of the Ar Rumaih to um al Maa', and having visited the Ar Rumaih at Um al Maa' and having again heard the Shaikh of Bahrain at his usual length on the subject, I believe that the draft proposed by me Is unsuitable. The real point is that made in paragraph 2 of Galloway's letter No.c/ 314 and replied to by the Ruler of Qatar in his letter dated the 7th Jamadah Awwal, 1366 (28.3.'47). (Copies of ■71 these letters went sent to you with Galloway’s demi-official letter No.c/338 dated the 10th March, 1947, and my demi- ^ official letter No.C/434 dated the 6th April, 1947.) The Shaikh of Bahrain, as I must admit was originally pointed out by Galloway in his Express Letter No.c/1376 of the 14th December, 1946, has no objection whatsoever to the Ar Rumaih emigrating from Bahrain to Qatar; what he objects to is their being settled in Urn al Maa' - in territory which (I siiwik- voijy usually by implication) he claims to be his. My draft does not deal with this question, and T feel now that it would be rather W /a Hon'ble Lt-Col. Sir Rupert Hay, K«C.I.E., C.b.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bahrain.a disingenuous evasion of the issue to send it. Besides it would do absolutely no good. I an inclined to think that having asked the Ruler of Qatar to remove the Ar Rumaih we should take action against him for refusing to do so. 2. In his monologue, lasting an hour and a half, of yesterday and on several similar occasions, the Shaikh of Bahrain no longer spent so much time in arguing that the Shaikh of Qatar has failed to observe the agreement concluded through the mediation of Hickinbothan. His main attack is now directed at claiming (a) his privileges; (b) his properties in Zubara. As regards (a) he relies on a letter which he received from Galloway from which I enclose the relevant extract. His claim to 'his properties' is also, he says, supported by a letter from Galloway though I have been unable to find any such letter. With regard to the Shaikh's claim to 'his privileges' I should be glad if I could be told what I should reply to him. Yours sincerely, % N3.Extract from letter No.C/324 dated the 9th March, 1947, from Lt-Col. A.C.

As regards the third part of Your Highness’ letter, it is agreed that some of your people had privileges in Qatar, and I am correct in saying that the Shaikh of Qatar has agreed that these should continue in Zubarah. indeed, I have just written to our friend Shaikh Abdullah on this very point and hope for a favourable reply of which I shall inform you.N !• I am recording the following note for the informa tion of Colonel Galloway in order to bring this tiresome| but important case up-to-date. 2 . It should be shown to him after he has taken over 2 2 as Political Agent here. 3. i heard the Shaikh for two hours and a quarter 2*3 on the subject of Qatar on the 20th October. I vamped * up a new defence to his charge that ,, our M 1944 agreement would neither be interpreted nor enforced; it was a little disingenuous, but after all, one has to reply something when a Shaikh can accuse the political Agent, with some justification, of letting him down. I told the Shaikh that I knew and he knew and the Shaikh of Qatar knows that he does not care a straw v/hether his people go to Zubarah to gather juss or graze their herds • or for any other reason, but that he is really trying to establish rights to do these things so as then to be able to quote them as arguments for his sovereignty over Zubarah. I said that that sovereignty had never been admitted by His Majesty’s Government and that it was straining the 1944 agreement to try to use it in order to assert sovereignty. The Shaikh replied that he admitted that Shaikh Abdulla bin Qasim was ruler ('Hakam') of all Qatar and then promptly contradicted himself by saying that he was not ’’Hakam' in Zubarah. I then asked him to name the ruler of Zubarah and he said that it had no ruler but that it was 'empty land'. I pointed out the absurdity of this statement and that there was no such thing, juridically speaking, as /'empty land'....v I*!i« '•empty land'. The Shaikh continued that he wanted his property in Zubarah, permission for his people to go there, and permission to exercise full jiurisdiction over his own people in Z ubarah . This may be taken as his full claim so far as the maw of an Arab can ever be filled in such who matters. Shaikh Abdulla bin Isa^/was with him was quite clever about this claim. In effect, he said 'After all this is quite an ordinary matter; the position of Bahrainis in Zubara would be like that of foreigners in Bahrain who are under your (i.e. H.M.Q.’s) jurisdiction.' Of course H.M.G. could never admit such a claim and the I Shaikh of Qatar would be insane if he did so - in any case, he is never likely to do so. 4. The war is now over, the labour situation is easing, and if Ward Anderson replies to my letter either that he does not use Qatar labour or that he would not miss what he has got, then the next time the Shaikh complains that the agreement is not being kept, he should be told to do what he likes about it, i.e., to revert to the conditions of embargo, etc., prior to the agreement or to take any other action he wishes. We will then be in a fairly strong position as, when he again complains, we could say 'We did d our best to settle Qatar questions and your intransigence made it absolutely impossible. We are not prepared to discuss it further now; nor are we prepared to have you iA' treated as a bargaining counter in dealing with matters of mutual interest'. Apart from the all important fact that this wretched dispute tends to hold up our political progress, in the State, it is intolerable, undignified and destructive of our good name to make ourselves a party to an agreement which, on the one hand, we can neither interpret nor enforce and, on the other, have so far been unable to tell /the21 /1. 95. (Note submitted by H.M.) ne Jasim bin J/Tuhaimnad Ar-Ruciaihi, rornierly Bahrain subject but now the subject of Qatar, arrived at Bahrain yesterday with a letter from II.E. the Ruler of Qatar to political Agent, Bahrain, in which the Ruler of Qatar asks lor assistance to oe extended to the bearer to receive back the gears of his diving boat. These gears consist of one mast, one Farman- (boom) and one water tank, which are said to be lying on the beach of Umm al Hasam. I have just now heard that this morning while Jasim bin Muhammad was coming towards the Agency he was stopped by the police and taken to the police Station for detention. He is, I understand, in possession of a certi ficate of Identity which he produced to the passport authorities on entering Bahrain. The lettfir referred to above is in the C.O. please. 96. 93. 99. A.P.A. Id./- A.M., 22/4/47. I have seen the' letter. Please find out at once why he has been arrested. Since he has brought a letter from H.E. of Qatar to the P.A. he should not be detained by the Bahrain police without any good reason. H.M. Id./- H.D.H.R., 22/4. 97. I have telephoned to Sub-inspector Abdul Karim and asked him why the man has been arrested. Re replied that the man is not under detention because he has not committed any crime; but that they wanted to record his statement for th^ information of the. Adviser. He added that he would let him off as soon as he heard from the Adviser to whom he had submitted a report, and that he would let us know when he had released him. Id./- A.M., 22/4. Sub-Inspector Abdul Karim later telephoned saying that H.II. the Ruler of Bahrain has given his order to detail* this man on the ground that he is the subject of Bahrain and not Qatar and that he should be kept under detention pending further orders from H*H* The Sub-Inspector added that H.H. has written a letter in this respect to the Political Agent and that the letter is on the way to the Agency, please.

Galloway gathered there had been a disagreement over a marriage and the non-payment of a subsidy, vide s.62. The question of what reply should be given to the Shaikh of Bahrain has been referred to P.R. at s.94. There has always been great freedom of movement of tribes between Bahrain and Qatar, e.g. the Naim, vide p.1304-1306 of Lorimer, and Bahrain and other PArts of the mainland. Che Al bu Rumaih are not ordinarly a nomadic tribe and have been settled in Bahrain for many years, vide p.240 and 1600 of Lorimer, but no Arab tribe completely loses this right of moving away from one Shaikh's territory into that of another, please see also p.107 of ?.4/13-1. flie Shaikh has referred, however, in his letter to the boats of the Al bu Rumaih being registered in Bahrain, and he may have the right to confiscate these and other property left behind by the emigrants.I'- .15 L15. ,'r , L17. [ 1 «. j .19. Confidential note for the attention of the P.A. X^) The news of the so called protest registered with the P.R. by H.H. against the interference of the A.P.A. in the Bahrain local affairs has been the topic of the day among some of the public, who entertained the news with a degree of surprise. They describe this attitude on the part of H.H. as extraordinary; for they say it is the first time that the Ruler of Bahrain has dared to challenge the British £xx Political Authorites. How this news came to be within the reach of the public is now yet known; but it can be supposed that it has been disclosed either by some of H.II,* s favourites or by the Advisorate office. ITD.

The principal correspondents in the file are: the Political Agent at Bahrain (Cornelius James Pelly; Lieutenant-Colonel Arnold Crawshaw Galloway), the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (Lieutenant-Colonel William Rupert Hay), the Ruler of Bahrain (Sheikh Salmān bin Ḥamad Āl Khalīfah), and the Ruler of Qatar (Sheikh ‘Abdullāh bin Jāsim Āl Thānī).The volume includes:an initial exchange of letters between the Political Agent and the Rulers of Bahrain and Qatar, between February and July 1945, relating to the Ruler of Bahrain’s complaints that some of his subjects had gone to a place called Bruk on the Qatar Peninsula (near Zubarah) to collect wood, and had been harassed by men associated with the Ruler of Qatar (ff 2-41). Underlying the dispute are the differing interpretations of the two Rulers to the agreement, signed by them in June 1944, to restore friendly relations between the states of Bahrain and Qatar, and to restore conditions at Zubarah to what they had been prior to 1936;correspondence between the Political Agent and Political Resident, relating to Bahrain-Qatar relations and the 1944 agreement, including: comment on the vagaries of the 1944 agreement (ff 61-63); the difficulties encountered in the handing over of the role of Political Agent from one individual to another; the historical context of Bahrain-Qatar relations, including a note, prepared by the Political Agent (Galloway) on the history of Zubarah, up to the present day (ff 100-107); discussion over the possibility of requesting the Ruler of Qatar to demolish his fort at Zubarah;ongoing correspondence amid a stalemate in the disagreement over Zubarah, including: the imposition by the Qatar Customs Officer of export duties on limestone shipped from Qatar to Bahrain (ff 50-54); the Ruler of Bahrain’s agreement that the Al Bu Rumaih tribe be allowed to emigrate from Bahrain to Qatar (ff 95-96); the dispatch of a deputation to Zubarah by the Ruler of Qatar; continued letters, some enclosing petitions, from the Ruler of Bahrain, making his historical claim to Zubarah (ff 125-138);correspondence relating to an incident in early 1947, in which an individual from the Al Bu Rumaih tribe, on returning to Qatar, was arrested and imprisoned by the Ruler of Bahrain (ff 167-204). An attempt by the Assistant Political Agent (Captain Hugh Dunstan Rance) to intervene in the matter in the Political Agent’s absence, provoked a strong complaint from the Ruler of Bahrain, which in turn brought a rebuke from the Political Agent (Pelly) on his return. In correspondence exchanged with the Political Resident in the wake of the incident, Pelly suggests that Arab rulers, including the Ruler of Bahrain, are beginning to challenge British orders, in light of Britain’s ‘recessive’ policy in Egypt and India (ff 203-204).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Qatar</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Assistant Political Agent, Bahrain</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Qatar</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Zubarah</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Territorial disputes</topic></subject><subject><topic>Bahrain-Qatar Peace Agreement (1944)</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0003cc#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
