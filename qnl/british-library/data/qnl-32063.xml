Karguzar has just received complaint from Sistan Revenue Director that Sardar Khudadad Khan refuses to pay revenue and defies him. Karguzar has invoked my assistance unofficially. It is essential that officers ignorant of local conditions should keep aloof from matters pertaining to civil administration if we are to maintain present friendly relations with Persian officials. Khudadad has done us good service and been well paid, but cannot claim privilege of British subject. Reply from Dyer which I am expecting (vide my telegram No. 43 E. of May 16th) has not yet been received.

Before quitting Bunder Abbas I should like to place on record my deep appreciation of the services of Mr. Howson, His Majesty’s Vice-Consul and of Assistant Surgeon Berlie, 2. Mr. Howson has treated the Mission most generously in placing a large part of the Consulate at its disposal, while his assistance in arranging the splendid reception on the arrival of the Mission, in advising on local matters, and in collecting transport has been invaluable. 3. Assistant Surgeon Berlie took medical charge of the Mission for over a month until the arrival of the force, but throughout he has retained the charge of the Consulate with its largely increased population. He has taken much trouble in sanitary matters and the Mission is under obligation to him. , Received on 5 J U l 1010 with INDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY’S Letter, No. M Bated 9 JUN19162 (Received with Army Department memorandum No. H. 4610. dated the 31st May 1916.

O’Connor has now written that he and his fellow prisoners could practically at any time seize the fort where they are imprisoned and asks in the event of this being done how soon I could arrive to their assistance. In one day my cavalry could push through to Ahram and the infantry could reach there on the second day. I have, however, no guns which could he taken with me. I should march from here with two battalions, but a company might have to be left on far side of Mashila at the point which could he reached by the motor transport. I have found out that during the frequent absences of Zair Edar very few men are usually left at Ahram and as I should be well supplied with machine guns, my part of the operation should be quite feasible even without guns. My personal opinion is that the attempt could be made without undue risk and that little resistance would be met with if no more effective operations are to be carried out. .

Wise and Blackwell only have joined me. I propose these as Commandant and second-in-command, respec tively, of Sistan and Kain Bevy Corps. I ask for four more officers, Adjutant, Quartermaster, and Wing officers. British officers will probably be stationed at Sistan, Birjand, Neh and Dehaneh Baghi. Whether Parran and Wickham have started from Nushki yet T do not know, but I propose to let them join Sarhad Levy Corps under Hutchinson. Proposed number of men in corps is— (1) Pour squadrons of camelry ... 461 officers and men. (2) Three squadrons of cavalry ... 346 „ „ (3) One double company Hazaras ... 230 „ „ (4) Indian instructors, armourer, farrier, 63 men. etc. Total ... 1,100 men. I request permission to enlist in addition, experimentally, one hundred Baghaluri infantry from Kainat. These men serve in local Persian Army and can, I believe, provide good material. Their enlistment will popularise corps in Kainat. If obtainable, I recommend enlisting another double company of Hazaras for service in Kerman. General Grover expressed the opinion that the whole police force should be leavened with this class. I recommend engaging levies who at present are not engaged for specified time, for service anywhere in Persia for three years with Indian conditions, as to continuance of service and pension.

About two-thirds of the corps will serve outside Sistan and draw command pay.4 Number of men actually in service is one thousand and ninety-five; we are weediog out those who are not likely to become efficient. I propose to maintain Transport Corps of sixty mules and ponies and one hundred camels* These animals will be purchased. Sowars at present own their horses and riding camels. Compensation when animals die is ordinarily payable. Equipment and rifles for five hundred men have been received by me. Five hundred and seventy sets more and revolvers for thirty officers are requested. This corps is expected to become at least as efficient as those officered by Swedes, I understand. Provision in my Budget Estimate will, therefore, be made for clerks, medi cal establishment and followers: also uniforms, tents, hutting and stationery. On hearing what strength of corps is sanctioned, I will post Budget. 7 Telegram P., No. 364- F., dated the 31st May (received 1st June) 1916. From—His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. My telegram No. 357. Soulet’s attitude, owing partly to jealousy of Kawam, partly to annoy ance at appointment of E(arman) E(arma) and partly to disappointment at not being paid by us, is entirely unsatisfactory. In spite of stringent orders sent by Government and E(arman) E(arma), he has persuaded Kawam to release one or two of the most objectionable prisoners at Shiraz including German Doctor. While German influence was in ascendant and policy of Central Govern ment was indecisive and vague, he never took any overt act against us, and I think it, therefoie, most unlikely that he will find courage to do more than he is now doing. But it is, on the other hand, quite certain that he will do nothing to liberate Consul. ° As E(arman) E(arma) will not be able to take action before autumn and to rescue as proposed by General Officer Commanding, Bushire, has been vetoed by Government of India and only method of liberating prisoners appears to be by direct negotiations with rebellious Khans.

They can perfectly well reach Shiraz via Ahwaz and Ispahan. I believe there is a fair body of gendarmes over 800 strong at Shiraz which, according to all my reports, is perfectly loyal, and there can be no possible risk in taking over large number of these men not necessarily of course en bloc if Barman Barma is able to make good his authority. According to Persian standards, existing gendarmerie is quite efficient and under British officers in a short time it will be converted into a very useful force for work they would be called upon to do. Soulet will do nothing. With the exception of raiding and scuttling at Chagodak, which I believe did more harm than good, we have done nothing whatever with our own force to assist Persian Government to turn to good effect the revolution in Shiraz affairs brought about by appearance of Bussian troops. It is becoming more evident daily that matters are not improving and P(arman) I^armays task will be rendered necessarily difficult unless we give proof that we are giving material assistance.

With reference to my telegram No. 342 0., dated the 11th May 1916, on the subject of the pacificatory measures being undertaken in Sarhad, I have the honour to enclose copies of the margin ally-cited telegrams which have passed between General Dyer and other officers and myself regarding Ali Shah Khan, Narui, the notorious ^-Telegraph Line Guard of Nasratabad Sipeh. 2. . Sardar Khudadad Khan, Narui, has, as I previously knew, always held a friendly feeling for Ali Shah Khan on account of tribal connection, though, I believe, there is no family relationship. He tried unsuccessfully to assist Mirza Khan last year when the latter was in prison at Birjand. I do not think that this interest need in fluence us much in our future treatment of Ali Shah Khan and his particular clan r . 3. It remains to be seen what weight General Dyer will attach to my opinion. I know nothing about the nature of his settlement with thet Sarhaddis, or what guarantees he is taking for their future good behaviour. I.

Has Sardar Khudadad Khan done you good service and is he pressing you to employ or forgive Ali Shah Khan ? I believe that, if you employ Ali Shah, he will stipulate for your assistance in recovery of telegraph appointment and will claim to be allowed to reside at Sipeh which is only- permissible if Telegraph Director reinstates him. He is of sullen and discontented disposition and in my opinion will not do good work for you if at same time he is aggrieved against Telegraph Department. I think he ought not to be forgiven for entering German service while in our employ. Do you not think of making any use of my News Agent at Dehaneh Baghi, Mirza Nur Muhammad Keqi, who has done good work since last November ? It seems to me that Chagai frontier officials ought to he able to assist you to perfect your intelligence arrangements without enlisting assistance of Ali Shah and that latter’s successor at Dehaneh should preferably be employed in your service.

Ali Shah Khan like Jehind and Juma Jehil has gone into General Dyer’s camp at Kacha and made submission. Dyer presses me to agree to his being employed in his Secret Service establishment. I replied that, while not objecting to his being included in general amnesty, I thought he ought not to be re-employed, as I understood you would not reinstate him as Line Guard and his land at Sipeh given to him by Department would be confiscated and given- to his successor. General says that question of re-employment on Secret Service is distinct from Telegraph Service question. I answered that his intelligence work would not he good enough until he was reinstated by Telegraph Department as he would nurse his grievance, and we have already found him sullen and of discontented disposition. In conclusion, I wired:—* Begins :— “ It seems to me that Chagai frontier officials ought to be able to assist you to perfect your intelligence arrangements without enlisting assistance of Ali Shah and that latter’s successor at Dehaneh should preferably be employed in your service.

In my opinion Alishah should be given either both jobs or neither, and I personally think we can manage without him.

I strongly deprecate Ali Shah or any of his tribe being reinstated as Line Guards. He has been a constant source of annoyance to the Department for years. Following extracts taken from notes written by Mr. Gabler and dated February 1913 indicate class of man he is : “ I have for some time had cause to be dissatisfied with Ali Shah’s behaviour, as he began to be very slack in his duties, and recently absolutely refused to send any sowars to Kuh Malik Siah to escort my post.” Further on he writes that Ali Shah, before about 60 men composed of Ghulams, labourers and tribesmen accused him of burking his pay. Only last year Ali Shah Khan, when his brother was a prisoner m Birjand, used threats against Mr. Gibbons’ life so effectively that the British Minister was compelled to demand the prisoner’s release. In December 1915, Ali Shah Khan sent his son with a few men to Sistan to fetch the pay of his sowars; after paying the money over, I told the boy to return to bistan as soon as he had purchased some grain he required, as I had work for him. I never saw him again. In February 1916 I asked Ali Shah Khan to take ° ver two m0Dths, P a y : he sent impertinent reply to tjie effect that hitherto he had been paid at Dehaneh. and he was not going to send beyond that place for it. I also asked him to send sowars to accompany me on inspection in early .February which he refused to do. rWvH o.

Copy of a telegram from the Director, Persian Section, Tehran, to His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Sistan, No. 255—4, dated the 9th May 1916. Ali Shah and his sowars are not really departmental employees. Sowars were originally provided by the Persian Government at our request in 1909 to protect lines in 7th Sub-Section, but as the Governor of Bam did not pay them regularly local representations resulted in Persian Government paying them through departmental Superintendent at Kerman. Prom all accounts Ali Shah appears to be an undesirable person to have reinstated in his former position and departmentally we might be better ^ served by someone else. If the Persian Government were to raise the question of his reinstatement with Minister here, I would, if asked, express above opinion.

Is this fact correct and can you tell me name of earlier chief and where he has since gone to ? Please reply at once, if possible. Enclosure No. 10. Copy of telegram from Mr. Dormer, Dehaneh Baghi, to His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Sistan, No. 290, dated the 11th May 1916. It must have been Gabler who informed you. It would take long time to trace records for information, but my Head Ghulam informs me Haider Khan ©f Pareh was first man to be paid for looking after lines. At time of appointment he held land at Sipi and paid revenue to Wali Khan, Governor of Bam and Narmashir. Binding that pay of appointment was never forthcoming, he resigned, but continued cultivating land at Sipi until Kamalan Surah, a nephew of Ali Shah, brought a lashkar against him and forcibly turned him out. Subsequently the Persian Government ordered Raafat-i-Nizam, Commander of the Bam Cavalry, to appoint a chief to guard the lines. Ali Shah Khan was the result. The land at Sipi was given to Ali Shah Khan free of revenue only so long as he remained chief of the Line Guards. Haider Khan is now at Pareh, but Kamalan Surab is dead. I will endeavour to trace official correspondence on subject, but doubt whether it will show much more than above. Enclosure No. 11.

Jemadar Khan Muhammad gives following brief details of General Dyer's operations in Sarhad, and alliance settlement with Sarhaddi Chiefs :— On entering Sarhad, General Dyer marched on to Jehind’s place and after a brief skirmish Jehind’s son and two well-known persons were killed and Jehind surrendered soon : but before his surrender his property and houseswere looted. Subsequently bis property was given back. Juma Khan, when sent for, attended soon. Halim Khan, Chief of Gamshadzai and Nur Muham mad and Shah Sowar, Jehind’s assistants, also attended. “ All were brought at Kacha where Durbar was held by General Dyer and good reward was granted to the chiefs and their working hands. They promised that they will be loyal to the British Government in future and will give 500 men for service as follows: Juma Khan 100, Jehind 100, Taj Muhammad 100, Halil Khan 100, Nauroz Khan, Kurd, 30 and Nut M uhammad, Kurd, 30. The Sarhaddi Chiefs and their tribesmen have gone to their places very happy and it is settled that some force will be kept at Khawashish, close to Jehind.” Now Sarhad affair is settled and it is expected that there may be no more raids, the route will be clear and mails will come regularly. 'General Dyer is very much pleased with Sardar Khudadad Khan’s work and will do some thing for him later on. 1U No. 583, dated Quetta, the 27th (received 30th) May 1916 (Confidential). From— The Hon’ble Lieutenant-Colonel Sir John Ramsay, K.CJ.E., C.S.l. Agent to the Governor-General and Chief Commissioner in Baluchistan, ’ 7 To—The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department. I have the honour to invite a reference to the agreement drawn up by Brigadier-General Dyer with “ some Sarhaddi Sardars”on the 24th March 1916 As I have already informed the Government of India, the first that I heard of this agreement was on the 9th May when I received a copy from the General Staff, Quetta. I think it is unfortunate that General Dver should have entered into this agreement without previous consultation with any Political Officer, but I refrain from further comment until I have had an opportunity of discussing matters with General Dyer as I hope to do before lono It may however, be of interest to the Government of India to know some details regarding the signatories to the agreement. 2 . It will be observed that the preamble to the agreement speaks of the undersigned Sardars and heads of tribes,” while General Dyer’s endorsement k th fif/? re ?&gt; m 1 ent . me f tlon o s tbe “Sardars, Tumandars and Sarkardars Biki- Kurd-Mir Balozai, &amp;c., &amp;c.”..

From—His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. Russian Minister and I met Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs by appointment yesterday morning. They urge on us pressing neces sity for bringing to an issue the two questions of creation of Military Police and of subsidy to Persian Government, both of which have been agreed to in principle by two Powers. As regards Police, insecurity of roads and alarming increase of brigandage since large part of gendarmerie has passed out of exist ence, prove imperative need of early understanding with two Powers while as to subsidy they trusted that information of Mixed Commission two Powers would see an earnest of sincere desire of Cabinet for real reform and a justi fication for subsidy. Russian Minister and I are very strongly of opinion that a favourable (reply ?) should be given. Expediency of putting first matter on a definite and formal footing without delay is incontestable while as regards latter we think that, if subsidy is granted, it will tend to strengthen position of Cabinet in eyes of public and facilitate extension of powers of Mixed Commission so as to secure effective control over revenue and expenditure in future which Cabinet seems ready to agree to. We think, however, subsidy can be reduced tomans 500,000 to 200,000 to be shared equally by two Powers. We, therefore, suggest that we should be authorised to negotiate with Persian Government on following lines :— (1) A proposed increase of Cossack Brigade to 10,000 with 30 officers and 60 non-commissioned officers from Russia and creation of corresponding force of Military Police in the south under British officers, each Power bearing cost of arming, equipping and training and of maintaining force during the war and for some months afterwards. Negotiation agreement to provide funds estimated at tomans 200,000 a month from Persian sources for maintenance after period abovementioned. Revision of tariff and payment of taxes by foreigners being indicated as possible source of funds. (2) Grant of subsidy of tomans 200,000 a month for period of war, expenditure to be entrusted to Mixed Commission. (3) Extension of Powers to Mixed Commission such as to provide for effective control over whole financial administration. Commission to (?) 15 to 20 years. These three agreements could be recorded by exchange of separate notes on same day. We believe agreement of this kind which would go far to shelve Persian questions for a definite number of years, could be concluded without much truck with present Cabinet. Figures in (1) are those furnished by Commandant of Brigade against tl e Russian War Office but could be presumably modified in case of southern force if so desired. Establishment of an effective control will, I presume, overcome objections of Government of India to subsidy.

C0Py ° f General telegram (67 V., 674?)His reference to worse state of affairs can apply only to nay telegram to Wikeley of the 20th April, repeated to General Officer Commanding Division, Quetta, in my telegram, dated 24th April, No. 227 C. (copy forwarded with my letter, dated 27th April, No. 278 C., to Government of India about ill-treatment &lt;9 °f Persian muleteers. I felt in this case that it was useless to ask Wikeley to give prompt redress and scandal of a general “ bast ” in Consulate seemed to me undesirable. Muleteers were invited later by General Dyer to stay on with 50 mules and to send remainder home; all however have elected to go. My relations with Officer Commanding, Robat, have in every other respect been good though formal. To direct military operations I have made no attempt, but my local knowledge ought, as it seems to me, to be placed at disposal of Commanders. It will be a matter of extreme pleasure to me when arrival of sufficient military officers relieves me of all work connected with levies including continual despatching of supplies to Neb, Dehaneh Baghi and other outposts and checking of accounts. Captains Blackwell and Wise are training their men without reference to me. Reference to Naruis made by General Dyer seems to concern Ali Shah Khan whom he wishes to employ in secret service, while I have expressed the opinion that he will give trouble and serve badly because his reinstatement at Nasratabad Sipeh is not acceptable to Telegraph Department. About Khudadad Khan there has been no discussion, but too much re liance, I hope, is not being placed on his capacity to maintain order in Sarhad. 210 Telegram P., No. 323 F., dated the 12th (received 13th) May 1916. From—His Britannic Majesty's Minister at Tehran, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. Advisability of Sykes starting work in Ears at the earliest possible moment is strongly urged for the following reasons:— 1 (1) If necessary, position in Kerman, which is reasonably safe, can be assured by forces under Dyer. (2) Eorce of some kind will be required by Earman Earma who is going to Ears. It will be much better that it should be provided for from very start by Sykes’ Mission. (3) Sykes, now that German agitation is over, could probably at once take over loyal part of existing trained gendarmerie just as Russians are enlisting gendarmerie in Oossack Brigade at Tabriz. Present cabinet would probably acquiesce but next might not be so complaisant; Persian Governments are short lived. (4) As to strength of Russian trained force in north, Russian Government seems to be unable to make up its mind and negotiations have been indefinite- ly delayed for formal arrangements providing for forces in our respective spheres. Russia is less interested in formal arrangements than we are as they have in Cossack Brigade an officially recognised nucleus and we ought there fore to place ourselves as far as possible in a similar position. (5) To extend sphere of Sykes’ Police from Shiraz to Kerman will he much easier vice versa, (6) Farman Earma is very anxious to have Sykes’ co-operation, and safe and practical route from Bunder Abbas can be linked together by him. (7) Organisation of force in Ears under British Officers will have a much more useful effect in Persian (mind ?) generally than such a force in Kerman. Addressed to Foreign Office; repeated to Sir P.

I have the honour to forward herewith, in original, a newsheet purporting to be issued from, the German Consulate at Kerman and two letters addressed to Sardar Jehind, Damani, and Juma Khan, Ismailzai, as X think.it may be of interest to the Government of India to see specimens of the literature which has been scattered broadcast along the Persian border by German agents. 2. These papers were intercepted by our agents and were brought to the Political Agent, Chagai. The newsheet gives “ correct news of the war in Rurope and Asia from November 1915 to the 20th January 1916”, and though much of it is true it is needless to say that the “ news ” consists only of what is favourable to Germany. The letter to Jehind Khan apparently rom ^ugmayer and endeavours to persuade the former to raise a jehad. Ihe second letter bears the seals of four Persians who describe them- selves as representatives of the German Empire ” and invites Juma Khan to collect tribesmen and camels to be in readiness to join the “ German army ’* which is approaching Nasratabad. : 3.

After compliments .—I have arrived at Bam with a number of high- minded Ottomau and Persian warriors in the cause of religion. Agha Saiyid Hasan has arrived at Bam and spoken to me very highly of you. He has told me that you are a great patriot and have never allowed yourself to be deceived by English imposters and cheats. Bravo ! You are a staunch Muhammadan and firm in your principles. You should follow the example of your brethren and use your best endeavours to expel the enemies of your religion. You are probably aware how honourable and patriotic Ottomans and Persians have armed themselves and fought against the infidels. The Ottoman, Persian and Afghan TJlema of Islam have declared a jehad against the enemies of their common religion. You should all combine and exter minate the enemies of your religion and country who have already become powerless. The object of my visit to these parts is to render you every assistance. The Government of the Emperor of Germany is united with the Governments of I urkey, Persia and Afghanistan and has battered the heads of your enemies in all actions. God willing it will not be long before a large army of Germans, Ottomans and Persians will start towards these parts with arms and ammunition to crush your enemy. If you carefully pay your attention to the affairs of India, you will see that these ireacherous Englishmen had made great plans to interfere with your water and territory and would have reduced you to great misery like the unfortunateHndians. Before it is too late, you should not give them an oppor tunity and should take immediate steps to expel your enemies and to live in your country in comfort and peace. j?. S. —It is incumbent on you as a Muhammadan to take immediate steps to crush the enemies of your religion. I have heard that a small party of Englishmen has come to Dehaneh Baghi. It will be very easy to crush them. Proceed at once, kill them and take possession of all their property, arms and ammunition and send me one rifle of each kind possessed by them as a specimen.— Usual conclusion. Enclosure No. 2.

You will see from Captain Bennett’s No. 67 of to-day’s date that our force had a very hard fight at Lirudik on 13th. At one time I feared we would be almost, completely wiped out, but Bennett managed to rally the handful of men with him and saved the situation. Mr. Dormer was largely responsible for saving the remains of our transport. He and a few others beat off the enemy at a distance of 100 yards. 1 wish to very specially commend Dafadar Muhammad Khan of the Consulate Escort for his gallantry and courage; he was magnificent. The three escort sowars also did extremely well, and I hear that the three Hazaras who were with Bennett also did splendid work. All wounded are doing well. I presume it is not necessary lor me to submit a formal report on the operations as this will be done by Bennett. Poor Chalmers died gallantly in the final and successful stand against an overwhelming force of the enemy. Enclosure No. 2. Telegram, dated the 16th April 1916. From—P. E.

Dated Girdi, the 17th April 1916. From— Captain A. D. Wise, Commanding Baluch Levies, To—His Britannic Majesty's Consul fqr Sistan and Kain. At about 1 p.m., on the 13th instant, I arrived at Gorandi with 20 lances under Captain James, 40 hfies under Jemadar Mehdi Khan, and about 40 J umbazes. At about 3 p. m. I received a report that Major Heron was just about to attack a iashkar near Leradik. I moved out with the cavalry and Jumbazes but seeing and hearing nothing I concluded it was a false alarm and returned to camp. At about 5 a.m., on the 14th instant, I received a report from one of my posts that a big lashkar had passed their post, which was about thiee miles Irom camp, at about 4 a.m. I at once gave orders to get ready, and at 5-45 a.m. moved out with 16 lances under Captain James, 30 rifies under Jemadar Mehdi Khan and about 30 Jumbazes. On picking up the tracks of the lashkar, I sent on Captain James with the cavalry with orders to — (a) cut ofi: the enemy from the hills, if possible; (b) hold them till 1 could get up.12 About 7-45 a.m. Captain James saw the lashkar at the base of the hills and opened fire on them. They replied and killed a horse. He then moved on further and again opened fire, but as bullets were still coming among his led horses, he moved on to a third position, bringing the laskhar between his men and mine who were just coming up. From here he opened long range fire on men visible on the tops of the hills. I came up about 8-15 a.m. with the Jumbazes, dismounted at about 800 yards from the enemy’s position, and advanced on foot. The enemy opened an inaccurate fire on us which, however, was sufficient to stop the Jumbazes. Seeing that the position was only lightly held 1 advanced with Jemadar Ali Juma and a Hazara sepoy to about 300-400 yards and w r as able to clear a low ridge running down from the high hills and subsequently to keep our side of the high hills fairly clear of the enemy. About this time Ali Juma was wounded. As I could not get up the Jumbazes, I decided to wait for the infantry to come up. While waiting for them, 1 discovered that many of the enemy with many camels were concealed in a narrow nullah running into the hills some 800 yards from where I was. As soon as the infantry arrived I sent them up the spur we had cleared, and they arrived at the top of the hills practically unfired on. When they got to the top they became visible to the enemy and one sepoy was wounded. The Jumbazes mostly accompanied the infantry up the hill. I now had complete command of the situation, and the enemy could only— (1) debouch into the plain under a severe cross fire; (2) retire to the hills on foot, leaving the whole of their loot. They finally debouched into the plain under a severe fire from cavalry, infantry and Jumbazes. Some 30 dead and mortally wounded were found, though I made no search for dead and wounded, having need of ali my men to collect the camels, flocks and loot we had captured. I could also see with glasses wounded men and camels among the retreating lashkar after we had ceased firing. Two un wounded prisoners were taken. Among the loot captured w f ere four full boxes of Government ammunition and one empty one, two officers’ kits and some sepoys’ bedding, cooking pots, &amp;c. Captain James co-operated with me most successfully, and I consider that his rifle fire, when the lashkar debouched, w ? as of much more value than ^ mounted attack would have been, considering the small number of men he had available. Jemadar Mehdi Khan led his men gallantly and well, and did all that he could have done. Jemadar Ali Juma showed great gallantry all through the action, and by his accurate shooting largely contributed to the enemy evacuating the spur running up to the high hills which was the key of the position. The informa tion and local knowledge supplied by the Jumbazes was invaluable, though at present they rather lack confidence in advancing under fire. The enemy was estimated at 300 strong, which was confirmed by the prisoners. They had a good many high-velocity rifles, also Alaninis and similar rifles. .No good rifles were captured. 236 No. 258 C., dated Sistan, the 25th April (received 10th May) 1916. From— Major F. B.

The position as regards these camel sowars is as follows :— Major Heron went to Dehaneh Baghi on the 28th January 1916 with one hundred of them. Lieutenant Chalmers accompanied him with only 50 Punjabi Infantry. . • ' Captain Wise took over the charge of the Koh-i-Malik Siah-Lutak road on March 21st, 1916 with about 80 Jumbazes. He was required to provide escorts for every military convoy as well as to watch the surrounding wells and roads for suspicious travellers. Both officers urgently required more men. I therefore let the fact he widely known, and as volunteers came in to the Consulate in batches of 20 or 30 with their own chosen leaders, I sent them all straight off to either Girdi or Dehaneh. All recruits were vouched for by men whom I believed trustworthy, such as Juma Khan, Ghulam Bashi of the Russian Vice- Consulate, Zahar Jan, Jemadar of British Consulate postal sowars, and Said Khan, ^-Jemadar of British Consulate Levies. Even the outlaws, Idu Khan and Juma Jalal, are related to these worthies and were vouched for by them. 6. Captain Wise, assisted by Jemadar Ali Juma, 106th Hazara Pioneers, has evidently made good progress with his batches of recruits. He is a first class soldier himself and has doubtless inspired his men with respect and admiration. 7. Major Heron of course is not a soldier either by training or inclina tion. He could not be expected to knock his unruly horde of 180 followers into shape in a few weeks. His chief assistants were a junior Dafadar of the Consulate Escort and a Consulate Ghulam (a Sistani Ghilzai, ^-Havildar of the 129th Baluchis). These men are not in the same category as Captain Wise’s Hazara Jemadar, and both have always borne an unfortunate reputation for quarrelling and back-biting. I think that their charges against Idu Khan may quite possibly he exaggerated, especially having regard to the excellent way in which the latter’s°bosom friend Juma Jalal fought on the 13th April. l am, therefore, inclined to oive Idu Khan a longer trial rather than drive him back into outlawry, making him a subject for the Military Police hereafter to tackle. The fact that some of the Levies fired into the air should not surprise anyone who knows Baluchi habits. It is notorious that raiders when attacking' a caravan are largely addicted to this practice.As regards the Hazaras, I recommend that for the present they he kept separate. They have done, and will do, very good work on the Neh-Biriand section, but they do not seem to like going further from home, and I doubt if many of them will agree to engage for permanent service in Sykes’ Corps. I heir non-commissioned officers are middle-aged pensioners. to ? ow m J 106th Hazara Instructors have got on exceedingly well with Sistani recruits, but arrangement is rather unnatural, and when the Sunnis think themselves sufficiently trained, they will resent continuance of Hazaras with them. I think that one or two companies of Hazaras in Sykes* Corps will be advantageous as they will give tone to the whole force. We could combine Earsiwans with them, as some of the latter enlist in ’ India already, but the men I, at present, am engagingare mounted while the Hazaras have not got horses. For the present and next few months it is better to have a sprinklino- of regular Hazaras with the Baluchis if we cannot get other Persian-speaking trained soldiers to give tone to the Corps and to assist the British Officers in command.

Prideaux, C.I.E., His Britannic Majesty’s Consul far Sistan To The ^ r p J t ^ retar y t0 the Government of India in the Foreign and Political I have the honour to forward copies of telegraphic correspondence which passed mainly between Major Heron at Dehaneh Baghi, Lieutenant-Colonel Wikeley and myself at Sistan on the subject of the advisability or otherwise of our troops attacking— (a) a party of Afghan gun-runners, and (&amp;) a Baluch lashkar, which were passing through the country being watched by our troops and levies specially in connection with the possible passage of German parties. 2. I hope that the Government of India will agree that my views were correct and that the Afghan and Baluch parties were rightly treated as onemies in the special circumstances. The Afghan caravan unfortunately escaped, in my opinion, because no British Officer was with the party watching the locality through which it was expected to pass. B w 8: J l3( ' lieve the severe punishment which Captains Bennett and Wise inflicted on the Ismailzai Lashkar had good results and probably saved General Dyer s force some arduous days of marching and fighting, though the sad casualties which occurred in the action at Laradik must always he regretted.I® 16 Enclosure No. 1. m i Telegram, No. 134, dated the 26th (received 27th) March 1916. From —Major Heron, Sipi, To—-His Britannic Majesty's Consul for Sistan and Kain. Yesterday about 3-30 p.m. one of Dai’s men reported that a party of the enemy, consisting of 35 men with Jambazy camels, had arrived at the Kunarak iangi and had caught some of our men and questioned them as to whether they were British spies. They swore they were not. All but one were released They kept him as a guide. About 4-30, Bennett moved out with, I think 45. of his men and 45 levies. The latter formed in flank and rear o-uard. 9 I accompanied the party. I will not describe operations which were conducted by Bennett beyond saying that a good many shots were exchanged. One Jambaz was very slightly grazed on the shoulder by a ricochet, otherwise we had no casualties. After nightfall we fell back to camp which we reached 9 P M * About half the troops were left in camp as it seemed not unlikelv that the enemy might have forces coming by other roads and might attack the camp in our absence. On our return we found another messenger had 'come and fl °m his report Mirza INur Muhammad and Dai thought it probable that Aflfn ai \ A ! ghan ar “ s cai yan. Mirza Nur Muhammad said a party of 25 Afghans had passed through about three months ago and had not yet returned, llns surmise was proved to be correct by another messenger, who came in earlv this morning and whom the Afghans recognized as having been with AH Shah Dhan when they were passing through. He further reported that they had turned back after the troops left, evidently intending to emerge from the^west end of the Tangi and to proceed eastwards by another route. There are two main roads they can take, one northwards and eastwards Ma Shushaki and Nakhila, and one southwards and eastwards between Dar-i-Ban dan anrl TtnA ■ Mahi. They presumably still hare oue of our levies who was on spy duS ani whom they caught. H.s name is Hasan, son of Glmlam Shah, onerf Jemadar Idu Khans men.

Copy o£ a telegram from Major Heron, Sipeh, to Consul, Sistan, No. 178, dated the 7th April 1916 (copy to General Officer Commanding, Robat; repeated to Captain Wise, Girdi). I hear that the lashkar which arrived Geragheh yesterday was not more than 300 strong and was composed of, firstly, Ismailzais under Juma Jehil, secondly, Gurgiches under Haji Gulab, thirdly, some Naruis under Mirza, brother of Alishah Khan. All intend to raid as many flocks as they can, but, in addition, number one wishes to be revenged on Kuhi-Sindis, number two on the Shebaks and number three on the Murrais. I am informed one of Mirza’s reasons for being with the lashkar is to prevent its doing anything that would bring it into conflict with us and to see that no damage is done to the telegraph line. My Jemadars do not think they have carried off the Dakis* camels; the latter have probably strayed. Enclosure No. 5. \ Copy of a telegram from Consul, Sistan, to General Officer Commanding, Kacha, No. 155 C., dated the 7th April 1916 (copies to Major Heron, Sipeh, Officer Commanding, Robat, and Captain Wise, Girdi). Heron’s 178 of 7th April. I hope it will be possible to give lashkar under Juma Jehil and Haji Gulab smashing blow. Former, because he is enemy of our Sistani Brahuis and has rejected our overtures for alliance. Latter, because he is known to have escorted one party of Germans quite recent ly into Chakansur. I thought he was still there. I also recommend that severest punishment possible be inflicted on Alishah’s section of Naruis includ ing confiscation of all their crops at Sipeh. This can easily be done when cavalry go there. Enclosure No. 6. Copy of a telegram from Major Heron, Sipeh, to Consul, Sistan, No. 181, dated the 7th April 1916. The following from Bennett, Dehaneh Baghi '.—Begins. “ With reference to the lashkar of 300 Ismailzais and Gurgiches who were at Geragheh yesterday afternoon—in order to intercept this lashkar on its return, I propose moving the whole of the present Sipeh force to Dehaneh as a temporary measure for this purpose : in this case the force would have to leave Sipeh to-morrow morning, please let me have your views on this subject.” Ends. It appears to me that from purely military point of view there are very great advantages in carrying out the move proposed by Bennett, but the following questions arise \ firstly, is it expedient to attack this lashkar at present and possibly convert the Ismailzais from being more or less neutral into throwing in their lot with Jehind and the Damanis and becoming defi nitely hostile to us; secondly, might our falling back on Dehaneh be mis construed into falling back from the Germans ? Please reply urgent. Enclosure No. 7. Copy of a telegram from Consul, Sistan, to Major Heron, Sipeh, dated the 7th April 1916. Your 181. For reasons given in my 155 C., I think we should attack this lashkar as hard as we can. We cannot countenance their raiding our Sistani friends, and Haji Gulab is a notorious German supporter. There may be Germans with the lashkar.Enclosure No. 8. Copy of a telegram from General Officer Commanding, Sistan, Kacha, to Consul, Sistan No. 74, dated the 6th April 1916.

I consulted Idu Khan and he agreed that it would be out of the question to keep our men in their present posts. I think this aspect of the question merits full consideration before we commit ourselves to an open breach with the Ismailzais. Enclosure No. 10.

Your argument seems to apply just as much to our attacking the Damams. These Ismailzais have gone to attack and raid Sistani flock owners within our sphere and behind our outposts. They have also quite possibly escorted some Germans with Haji Gulab up to easy reach of frontier Juma Jehil refused to go to Kacha like Mir Jehind, and it was he who raided the big British caravan at Neh four years ago. Agent to Governor-General, Baluchistan, says that inflicting heavy punishment on Jehind will bring him to his senses and make him ask for peace. I think same policy towards Juma Jehil is desirable. We must not tear reprisals from Sarhaddis. We must prove ourselves too strong for such considerations. If necessary, we will send you more men to strengthen your observation posts and you should try to entertain Shebaks and Murrais who are at feud with Ismailzais. a i ^ k e a grave indication of weakness on our part to allow Sarhaddis to raid flocks and herds owned by Sistanis, and we mu^t show them that we intend to block Robat-Sipeh line to them.

Your 216 X. and 217 X. Unless Germans are with Ismailzai Lash kar, I do not believe latter will go so far north of Neh, Aliabad, Bandan or Baring. Their object will be to carry off flocks, and Girdi and JDehaneh Baghi ought to be able to deal with them. If Germans are with them, I think they will try to join gun-runners and cross Baring-Bandan road like first contingent. I therefore think that special attention should be given to latter road and our force on it should attack whichever party ol enemy approaches it. Our infantry would be safe from these parties in any fort along road, namely, Bandan, Aliabad or Neh. Lashkar would never think of attacking these, as inhabitants have often in past proved themselves capable of driving them off.If lashkar goes north of Neh there will he time to reconsider situation. I think it is most important for Lieutenant IJloth’s force to deal with gun. runners. Enclosure No. 16.

(2) We have been promised a large quantity from three Kadkhudas during next 4 days, and in 10 days our barley difficulty should be over. (3) At present it also seems impossible to feed mules if they go outside oasis. (4) Wise has got very few rifles left at Girdi, and there is possibility of gun-runners going that way if they hear from their spies that Lutak-Koh- Malik-Siah road is easier to break through than Baring-Bandan road. I am sending Wise 35 more Jambazes to-morrow with more than 40 rifles. (5) I suggest your letting James stand fast until we get news where two enemy parties are. He can move faster than they. (6) If you care to let second troop borrow supplies for short period from troop at Girdi in case of approach of enemy, it could go to Lutak now and eat Khasil there as easily as here, and it would be able to co-operate with James if enemy came through between Girdi and Lutak.

Our observation posts were originallv intended to report on actions and movements of Germans, and my inform ation was not sufficiently complete for me to know that you could afford to ignore the German menace. Observation posts would presumably be strength ened by levies; they are far apart and could not afford mutual sunnort.

Heron’s 194,195 and 196. It is quite certain that Jehind knows before this that a strong British force has gone to attack him. He cannot help Juma Jehil. It is almost equally unlikely that Germans will cover the eight days’ march eastwards with their levies deserting them, and with the whole Narui tribe, except Alishah’s section which is now terrified and probably ready to betray them, against them. The Ismailzais who can go to assistance of Juma are probably few and badly armed. I suggest your moving troops out of Bobat and helping Bennett with them, as I think Lashkar will try to return by Nakhilu route. I have ordered Masi Khan* to raise all the riflemen he can in Neh. He says he can get between » Of Neh. 100 and 200. They will march towards Haiderabad. Is it possible for our infantry at Neh to accompany them ? I hope cavalry from Birjand will follow them. There are also 40 Persian Jambazes and 40 Persian infantry approaching Neh from Birjand who will co-operate. Thorburn has gone out this evening with 30 rifles to supervise work of Infantry at Baring. We may be able to send these forward to Madeh Kariz if it becomes established to-morrow that Afghan caravan is no longer west of Baring-Bandan road. I would like to see your Girdi cavalry also move to Sipeh, where they can live on Alishah Khan’s crops, but until our infantry can prevent Sarhaddis emerging eastwards vid Madeh Karez and Safidawa there is the possibility that these raiders may take refuge in Afghanistan. I hope Heron clearly understands now that we must rescue flocks of Khudadad Khan and other Sistanis or lose prestige throughout country. I am doing all I can to encourage Shebak and Murrai tribes to resist Lashkar also. Enclosure No. 21.

On May 1st British Vice-Consul at Birjand reported that Cossacks had Been instigated by new Naib of Nim Buluk to harass ^-Naib on grounds of helping the Germans and having stored grain for them. Russian Vice-Consul was informed by Colonel Guschin that Cossacks acted under his orders. Mr. New and Monsieur de Bravine jointly interviewed Hisam on subject. Latter promised that his subordinates would not harass Shaukat’s followers. We cannot, I think, ask Russians to return any grain which they have com mandeered, as our own troops have been compelled for weeks past to take grain and green corn by force on payment at Bandan, Neh and other villages. I beg you not to give ear now to any complaint of Shaukat. His favourite tactics was always to come to me with complaints against Russians. Main reason for his deserting our side was, I believe, that he used to hear of friendly receptions given to Hisam always by your Legation. That Hisam should lose confidence in us for same reason is most undesirable. Just before Shaukat left Birjand he had started to quarrel with Sistan Karguzar over great assistance given by latter in collection of grain for our troops, and if he had not providentially been removed situation would have quickly gone from bad to worse. I recommend that Shaukat he exiled from or released by Meshed as quickly as possible. He is certainly going to make mischief in Tehran.

Prime Minister had a long conversation by telegraph yesterday with Kawam and Soulet and instructed them to adopt very tirm attitude in dealing with rebel Khans, and, if necessary to use force to obtain release of prisoners. Two Chiefs are given full powers pending arrival (of ?) Governor and local gendarmerie was placed under their orders. Ibey replied that (they ?) understand situation and will act as instructed. I have telegraphed resume of your telegram No. 179 1031 to Eoreign | Office expressing concurrence in view. Bushire hinterland can now be dealt I with and my belief (is ?) that rebel Khans under pressure from north and south | would surrender. Malcolm telegraphed yesterday via Ispahan that more executions have taken place, those of brothers Hassan and and Imam Guii Khans, and that Angmann, Baud Khan and Moazad Sultan were put on trial the same day but trial was adjourned.

To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla (repeated to Baluchistan). I have lately received copies of Eoreign and Political Bepartment tele gram, No. 47 S., dated April 13th, and Baluchistan letter No. 343 C., dated April 2nd. . I have had nothing to do with General Byer s recent operations beyond sending Sardar KAudaclad Khan to Kacha Koh. Dyer showed me clearly that he considered himself qualified to deal with situation and that he alone held\ 4 Government Mandate. This seemed correct. Of the character or extent of the powers delegated Dyer in connection with negotiations tollowing military operations I have been told nothing. . I volunteered to go on a political mission with Khudadad if Dyer was willing to stay at Sistan to take charge of measures against Germans, but that we both should be absent from here in view of critical situation as regards grain supplies I thought it highly undesir able. About the terms of settlement I have not been consulted in any way. I hope Government of India in these circumstances will not require me to attend to Sarhad matters. The political supervision of Kainat and Sistan is. a big enough charge and the Governor is now pressing me to go to Birjand for consultation on various matters. Directly I return from Robat I piopose to do this. Webb-Ware used always to be in closer touch with Sarhad Sardars than Consuls of Sistan. Cannot a special Political Officer be attached to column who knows Baluchi if Hutchinson is nowadays devoting all his attention to Afghan frontier ? He should continue in political charge when the force returns to India on accession of peace or on advance to Kerman. His head quarters may be at Dehaneh Baghi which, I think, will become an important station for military police after the country becomes settled, as all supplies can be locally grown at Sipeh where there are eighty Karezes. 176 Telegram P., No. 316 C., dated (and received) the 6th May 1916. From—His Britannic Majesty's Consul for Sistan and Kain, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla (repeated to Baluchistan). Please see Dyer’s telegram to Chief of the General Staff, No. 254, dated April 29th. Will 500 Sarhaddis raised at Kacba Koh be incorporated in Baluchistan Levy Corps or Persian Military Police? I hope that neither Major Parran and Lieutenant Wickham nor 300 rifles on way to Sistan will be diverted to this new force as I am in urgent need of at least one officer at Dehaneh Baghi(?) to command Sistan Levies and another officer for Sistan dep6t. Northern Sarhaddis and Sistan Brahuis and Naruis should, in my own opinion, be amalgamated in one Camel Corps for which we would require at least six officers. Sarhaddi element I regard at present as particularly unreliable. (I ?) would like to see a considerable number of Mussalman instructors from British Indian (regiments ?) among them. British Officers attached to this particular Corps run, I think, greater risks than those with Hazaras or troops raised by Sykes. Would it be possible to pay them more highly ? 177 Telegram, No. 306 F., dated (and received) the 7th May 1916.

Perhaps if you agree half of the balance could be sent to be divided between Kawam and Soulet to enable former to finish up Shiraz and latter to make arrangements for road and for putting pressure from north on hostile Khans to force them to release prisoners. If this is approved, Minister could draw on Residency and remit as he suggests. Kupees and Indian currency notes are not current in Persia except in one or two coast towns. Sovereigns of course are, and were largely used by Germans in their financial transactions. The last batch of rifles amounting to about 1,800 has not been taken over by Kawam and I am having them brought up to Bushire for storage.

Owing to the escape from Bussian territory and return to frontier of Ilbegi of the Kaudani Taimuris and Mir Baki Sultan who had been arrested by the Russians, Afghan frontier near Karez is in a disturbed state. They threaten to take revenge by attacking Karez and putting the inhabitants, including the Russian and British Agents, to death. The Officer Commanding the Russian troops has been warned by me. The Karguzar and Governor-General have telegraphed to their Government asking for sanction to the employment under Shuja-ul-Mulk of 150 sowars.

Your telegram, No. 143 S. So far as Germans are concerned, I gather that Kerman is safe enough, while such information as 1 have of Afghanistan affairs leads me to suppose that there is little ground for apprehending any move westwards from that side. I consider that, in the circumstances, our minor interests in Kerman should make way for our greater interests in Pars where conditions though immensely improved are still very far from satisfactory and where Intelligence (all ?) Department (?) state that continued unrest exists. Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs has suggested that Farman Farma should be appointed Governor-General of Pars. I had already asked Sir P. Cox’s views on such an appointment with a view to recommending it to Foreign Office, and finding that he approves I warmly supported the idea. In pursuance of this policy I think General Dyer might with advantage pro ceed as suggested to Bam and Rigan and even Kerman as his presence in the proyince will guarantee maintenance of order and that Sykes should move as soon as possible to Shiraz and lay foundations of military police there. It seems to me very necessary that, as counterpart to predominant influ ence Russians have acquired in Northern Persia, we should make good for ourselves in that part of south where our various interests lie.185 Telegram P., dated (and received) the 8th May 1916. jr r0I fl —Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Sykes, K.C.I.E., C.M.G., Bunder Abbas, fjo The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment.

An English translation of the agreement and the payments made is also included. THE AGREEMENT. We, the undersigned Sardars and heads of tribes, having presented ourselves before General Dyer Sahib Bahadur a,t Kacha, at the invitotion of the Tahsildar of Kacha, and having taken allegiance to Hls ^he Government with all sincerity of heart, do hereby declare that we and all t e people of our tribe are obedient and loyal to this Great British Kingdom. We have been independent from time immemorial and have been the neighbours of the Great British Empire. Our relations with the Political Agent of Chageh have always been very cordial. Now our respected and obliging friend the Political Agent of Chageh has advised us to present ourselves before General Dyer Sahib Bahadur and consult with him on certain matters. ■ Surely this is the time that we should show our loyalty and good feelings and offer our services to the British Government. Our highlv esteemed General Dyer Sahib Bahadur has shown us great kindness, aSd has granted rewards and fixed monthly pay for us and the people of our tribe. Hence we, the undersigned, having taken into consideration the advantages accruing to us and our keen desire to serve the British Government, do hereby sign this Agreement, and we agree to surrender our rewards and pay it we tail to fulfil our promise in the slightest degree ; more so, we also agree to pay any fine or undergo any punishment which the British Government may choose to inflict if we act contrary to this Agreement. The following is what we hind ourselves to :— (1) We give permission and power to His Britannic Majesty s Govern ment to fix out-posts and take their troops anywhere in our territory, whenever they choose to do so. (2) We shall help the British Government with any number of men whenever, and in whatever place, they will be required. We and our people will serve the Government as loyal subjects. The British Government will exercise the same power and will have the same rights over us as it has over the Sardars of Sarwan and Jhalawan, and we will serve the British Govern ment in the same way as these Sardars do. (3) If the troops of the enemies of the British Government ever enter into ; our territory, it will be our duty to capture them and hand them over to. the British Government. If the numbers of the enemy be large, and if our strength he not sufficient to overpower them, w,q will report at once to the omcers or the British Government. If the British Government send troops to oppose the enemy, we will with all our resources help the British troops. (T) If any Sarhaddi Sardar or any tribe accepts service under the enemies- of the British Government or spreads disloyalty and sedition at the instigation of the enemy in the territory, we will at once punish them, hut, if their numbers be great, we will ask for help from the British Government to sup press them. In the same way, if any Sarhaddi Sardar or people of any tribe in company with the enemy invades British territory or spreads sedition, we and all our people will help the British troops and oppose the enemy with all our might. (5) After the cessation of hostilities between the British and German Empires (may God grant victory to the British Government), we will ask for the same concessions and privileges as are enjoyed by the Sardars of Mekran, Sarwan and Jhalawan.

It was reported on 9th April that a force of Bakhtiaris, numbering about 600 and including some Persian Gendarmes, intended to cross Kharkheh River in neighbourhood of Pal-i-Pul and enter Dizful District, they having been driven from Kermanshah District by the advance of the Russians. I consulted Cox by wire, and then on April 11th directed Younghusband to prevent them crossing the river or entering the Dizful District, With two squadrons 2 Brd Cavalry from Shush and assisted by some friendly tribesmen, he intercepted the band at the crossing.

Death of Kawam, Acting Governor of Pars, has again rendered situation in Shiraz temporarily precarious. Although German agents and many of their adherents are under arrest, od manv of the local democrats and rebellious Gendarmerie are still at large and are showing some activity and just at this moment passage of Kashgais and Kawam’s tribesmen close to town in the course of their annual migration to their summer quarters is further source of anxiety, as their tribal jealousies may easily lead to collision of which democrats would take advantage. Kawam’s son on account of his youth and Soulet-ud-Dowleh for obvious reasons are ineligible as Acting Governor, and, in the circumstances, I have, at the urgent insistence of the Prime Minister on necessity for presence at Shiraz of a representative of the Central Government through whom they can act agreed to allow Nasret-es-Sultan eh to proceed thither. Ueseiv( IBNasret-es-Sultaneh is tbe Shah’s favourite uncle and was appointed to Tars last December but has, at my request, been detained till now at Ispahan as, owing to his youth and inexperience, he is not fitted for so difficult a post and the excellent Vice-Governor who was to bear lead him declined to proceed!

(2) At Baft on April 9th the Deputy Governor and his men fought a German party from Bunder. The party consisted of five Germans and 45 followers. The fight, which the informer witnessed, resulted in five followers dying, including two Kermanshahis and one Afghan, and one German and five followers being captured, together with one machine gun and 22 mules loaded with money, munitions and baggage. The remainder advanced to Sirjan. (3) Baft is still the location of the prisoners. (4) He arrived at Sirjan on April 11th, having followed the fugitives. The head (of his ?) party assembled trying to collect riflemen which they said were for the purpose of escorting them back to Kerman.

It seems clear that by some means Persian Government’s telegrams to Shiraz have not been delivered to Kawam and Soulet who have been, therefore, in some doubt as to what course to pursue. However, after some hesitation they finally decided on strong action, upon that two of late Kawam’s servants were executed after trial May 1st and further trials were to take place to-day. Probably Angmann will be among accused, but it is believed that he will not be executed. I am taking steps to ensure delivery of Persian Government’s telegrams in future. Persian Government is very nervous, lest nomination of Kawam, as Acting Governor-General, pending arrival of Governor-General, should arouse Soulet’s jealousy and alienate him. They have, therefore, without giving Kawam title of Acting Governor, made him responsible for state of Shiraz until arrival of Governor-General, and latter’s Deputy, who should reach Shiraz very shortly, has been instructed to take no action except with Kawara’s assent.

The news of the outrage reached me about 11 p.m. on the 7th April and I immediately communicated with the Commodore, Persian Gulf. He i toucli iritl fe , at any rate 1 enerai Dyerii latter to kef i at once ordered H. M. S. “ Hardinge ”, the ship which happened to be nearest to Lingih, to go there until relieved by H. M. S, “Philomel ” which was also ordered to Lingah The next morning His Excellency Darya Begi was in formed ; he was much upset by the news and wished to proceed at once to the scene. Arrangements were, therefore, made to get the Persian gunboat “ Persepolis” down from Mohammerah, and on her arrival on 12th His Excellency left. In the meanwhile as it seemed likely that the mutineers would try and return to Dashti Tangistan by sea, H. M. S. “ Clio ” proceeded down the coast with an emissary from the Darya Begi to warn the local i No, Khans and Shaikhs. No signs of the mutineers were, however, found, and it seems probable that they separated and made their way in two parties by inland routes. On receipt of the names of the mutineers it was ,916. found that three of them lived in Halila and Jabri villages on Bushire Island. Their property was at once confiscated by the local Government. The list also showed that only 14 tufangchis mutinied and not 40, as w r as April 2tt ‘ i,; erroneously reported in my telegrams : this number was based on the supposition that all the tufangchis at Lingah had mutinied. 3. It is unnecessary for me to go into the details of the actual attack sontr ii ^ ie rffc» lr r w»»' sl which is well described in Assistant Surgeon Johnstone’s report (Enclosure No. 5). The mutiny and attack took place soon after noon on the 6th April and apparently took the local authorities and the respectable part of the townspeople completely by surprise. I think this surprise paralysed the Deputy Governor of Lingah, who certainly displayed no activity in sending in pursuit of the mutineers. The leaders of the tufangchis at Lingah and a good number of them are Tangistanis, and so they are always referred to as “ Tangistani Tufangchis”, but this is a misnomer, as they are by no means all Tangistanis; in fact at least 8 out of 12 who fled from Lingah10 after committing’ the crime hail from Bushire Island, Angali, Dashti and other places outside Tangistan. The leaders of these tufangchis are relatives and adherents of the old Khans of Tangistan dispossessed by Zair Kbadhar, and have always been considered hostile to the latter. The theory that the out rage took place in revenge for events in Tangistan. is, therefore, improbable, and the more so at this time when no serious hostilities have taken place for weeks, and probably not a single Tangistani has been killed since September 9th last. 4. It appears more probable that there was a plot by Germans and Democrats to kill the Kawam and the Kesidency Agent, but they were unable to effect their object as far as the Kawam was concerned, and they therefore concentrated their attention on the Kesidency Agent. 5. Khan Bahadur Agha Badr had served Government very well for 14 years as Residency Agent, and before this he had been actually doing the work for many years as Deputy for his father Haji M uhammad Amin who was Kesidency Agent before him. During this time he has done excellent work and he had a lot of influence at Lingah and in the Shib Kuh ports. The Khan Bahadur’s brother Khan Sahib Agha Ali had always assisted Agha Badr, and had besides acted once or twice as Residency Agent, Shargah, and as Dragoman at Maskat and at Bahrain. Agha Ibrahim had been Dragoman of the Lingah Vice-Consulate since it was started in 1910. All three brothers thus worked for Government, and by their death three valuable servants have been lost. 6. I beg to invite the attention of Government to the remarks made by Captain Dali Thompson, R.N., Commanding H.M.S. “Philomel”, regarding the behaviour of Assistant Surgeon Johnstone, Quarantine Medical Officer at Lingah, and venture to endorse them. I think Assistant Surgeon Johnstone behaved extremely well in difficult and dangerous circumstances and I have the honour to bring his conduct to the notice of the Government of India.

Extract from a letter of'proceedings from the Captain, E.M.S. “Philomel”, to the Commodore, Persian Gulf, No. 21, dated at Renj am, 11th April 1916. Completed with coal on Priday, 7th April, and at 1 a.m., 8th April, received message from Consul re murder of British Residence Agent and his brothers and some sepoys at Lingah. At same time heard Jask trying to get through a Clear Line message which could not be read owing to atmospherics. Raised s earn at once and at 2-45 a.m. sailed for Lino-ah with despatch. At about 9 a.m., when nearing Jask, I received your P. 224 on the same subject. Anived Lingah 2-30 a.m., 9th April, and found “ Hardinge ” already there an as all appeared quiet on shore, the mutineers having escaped towards angis an, and m view of your message to me re that ship returning as soon as possi e, oideied her to return to Bushire stopping at Magam and Asalu to e ivei etters from Deputy Governor to various chiefs to endeavour to catch tne mutineers on their way north to Tangistan and offering rewards. Hardmge ” sailed at 6 a.m., 9th April. ^ A,M ' . oa Vice-Consul Howson came on board to see me concern- i g a airs at Lingah. ihe mutiny of the Tangistanis appears to have corneasan entire surprise to all concerned. They first murdered the Besidency Agent, as he was leaving a coffee house in the bazaar, then his two brothers, who came to see what was going on, then divided into two parties, one of which attacked the unsuspecting Guard of Sepoys, killing two and wounding three, and the remainder attacking Deputy Governor in his house and also firing on the house of the Quarantine Doctor (Dr. Johnstone). Deputy Governor put up a good fight, as bullet marks, etc., in his house show, and claims to have killed the ringleader with his own rifle. The majority of his guard appear to have run away or hidden. At that time mutineers had possession of two corner towers of his fort. Shortly afterwards they appear to have left the town, but in the confusion no one can tell me exactly when. Authentic news has been received that convoy with arms and ammunition for Kawam is safe and had not been attacked by mutineers who had gone by the coast road. I suggested endeavours to track them and obtain reliable information where they really were. At 4-30 p.m. I went on shore to interview Deputy Governor with Vice-Consul and various officials, and had some prisoners (one wounded) interrogated in my presence, hut could get little information from them. Deputy Governor agreed to send parties out to search for tracks and otherwise trace mutineers (this should have been done before;, but they undoubtedly scared and scattering and being 'Tangistanis are endeavouring to return to Tangistan. I made efforts to discover the motive of the mutiny, but failed to get any direct evidence, but it was undoubtedly political and directed against British Government, probably by German influence working on the naturally hostile feelings of Tangistanis regarding recent incidents near Bushire. The wisdom of continuing to employ Tangistanis in positions of trust and importance under present conditions appears doubtful. I consider it a matter of importance to add that, in my opinion (I have not heard this put forward at all and possibly should not be supported in it), the immediate and direct cause of the outbreak is the recruiting campaign at present being carried on by Sir Percy Sykes for his Persian Police Force which raised suspicions, and, coupled with some German intrigue, caused the Tangistanis, who were nominally loyal, to turn against us at the last and bring off this coup. The attitude and vacillation of Lingah men when recently requested to join this force tends to confirm this opinion. Prom what I gather from General Sykes, it is not intended that this force should be of any use to us during this war, but to police Persia after peace is declared. Supposing my theory to be correct, it seems a pity to involve matters at present for a force which is to be of no use to us till after this war. I should like to bring to your notice the conduct of Dr. Johnstone (Quarantine Doctor) who was the only white man present and who appears to have behaved admirably and kept cool and collected when all the remainder lost their heads. Also, although being fired at himself, he at once went into the worst part of the town to the assistance of the mortally wounded Besi dency Agent when he heard he was wounded. I left Lingah for Henjam on evening of 10th in order to get into wireless and telegraph touch and as there appeared to be no further necessity for a ship there. In this the Vice-Consul concurred. Enclosure No. 3. No. 112 C., dated Busdire, the 15th April 1916 (Confidential). p rom Major A. P. Tkevor, C.I.E., Deputy Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, rp 0 Commodore, Persian Gulf Division, Bushire. I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 025, dated loth April 1916, forwarding a copy of a letter of Proceedings from H.M.S. Philomel”. 2. Captain Hall Thompson gives a very interesting account of the outrage at Lingah, and I am much obliged to you for letting me have a copy, as it is the first detailed report I have yet seen.12 3. The incident is a very regrettable one, and I can only imagine due to the tufangchis having been bribed by someone to commit the outrage. 1 do not think affairs in the Hinterland of Bushire had anything to do with the matter, because these tufangchis though Tangistanis were adherents of the old Khan family which has been dispossessed by the present man Zair Khadhar; in fact, as the latter has been dismissed by the Persian Government as a result of the attacks on Bushire, the Lingah tufangchis should have been pleased at the turn affairs had taken in their country. Besides this, matters have been quiescent here for months. It may also be added that the Residency Agent’s brother Agha Ali had great faith in these tufangchis who ha i been in Lingah for some years, and supported them when the Deputy Governor wished to get rid of them. The matter thus is only explicable by the theory that the tufan^chig were put up to assassinate the British Agent by enemy Agents either German or Turkish. So far no proof has been found against any one. I think it is practically certain that if the leader of the tufangchis had had time to hear the latest news from Kerman and Shiraz which is to the effect that the Germans have been defeated at the former place and sent under escort to the latter, while Shiraz has been occupied in the name of the Govern- ment by an c^-Gendarmerie Officer, he would have thought twice about com mitting this crime on behalf of the losing side, and tne tragedy would not have occurred. I am not in a position to say if Captain Hall Thompson’s theory of the effect of recruiting for the new Military Police is correct or not: letters from Kerman show that some of the most influential men there favour the scheme. Its object, of course, is simply to establish in the British sphere a Military Police force officered by British officers instead of the Swedish Gendarmerie which has rebelled against the Government and been the Germans most power ful weapon in Persia. Lingah is a place lor extraordinary reports and ru r.ours, and it L possible some garbled account may have got about. I shall make some enquiries about this matter. Enclosure No. 4. Copy of a preliminary report (letter No. 117, dated the 17th April 1916), from Mr Vice- Consul Howson to the Deputy Political Resident, regarding the mutiny of eertain tufangchis at Lingah and the assassination of Khan Bahadur Agha Badr, the Residency Agent, and his two brothers, and the killing of two sepoys and wounding two others of the Consulate Guard.

On landing I proceeded direct to interview the Deputy Governor and nHens ?„ .7 0nd Shaikhs of Mrghu and Char,4 he had taken no steps to inform the remaining Shaikhs of the Shib Kuh, the Soulet-ul-Mulk or the headmen fH ^ and other chiefs of the interior anv tn an.tb^ I f 4 llaSeS f th «''^‘bourhood of Lingah nor had he sent any tutan elns or trackers after the absconding mutineers I had already fheTlo take imrd b0 t rd 'T* t0 tlle Shaikhs and chiefs k n^ ^ wfrd of KvnTr nnn f PS t0 a PP rehend the mutineers and offering a theifchie i fii l h ’ ? ! ‘“a 'T 7 ^ngchi and Kraus 10,000 for £ U j Kha,n taken dead or alive. I got the Deputy Governor towrite letters in the same strain and despatched those addressed to the Shaikhs of Chiru, Gaobandi, Surubash, Giladar, Kalat and Mogam with a special messenger named Khalu Bakir by H.M.S. “ Hardinge ” at midnight on the 8th. The same night I despatched the remainder of the letters by special Kasids to Yiravi, Ishkanan, Bastak, Tahuna, MoghUj Charak, Gafar Khan, Akhand, Chah Mubarak, Marbakh and His Excellency the Kawam-ul-Mulk. On the 9th I received information that a party of six mutineers were seen near Kuh Bostaneh and I immediately insisted on the Deputy Governor lending out a party of 15 armed men with a few trackers to search the hills. They found no traces of the mutineers and returned on the 15th having gone no further than Bostaneh. On the 9th, I also asked the Deputy Governor to institute a house to house search of the town, as I had heard that some of the rebels had re-entered the town. The search was only carried out on the 15th after I had sent several messages to the Deputy Governor and written him two official letters on the subject. On the 10th I despatched duplicates of all my letters to the Shaikhs and Chiefs and on the 13th I despatched two spies by the coast road and two by the Gulsham-Murbakh-Gaobandi road to make enquiries. I also despatched the Agent of Bakir Khan of Ashkanan on a similar errand. Before leaving Lingah I received replies from some of the Shaikhs and chiefs to the effect that they had not received any information of the where abouts of the mutineers and that they would do their best to arrest them. His Excellency the Darya Begi arrived on the 16th having visited many of the small ports on the way from Bushire. He failed to obtain any informa tion about the mutineers and he was inclined at first to think that they must have gone by sailing boat. After enquiry, however, he thought it more likely they had gone by land. Though the Gulsham-Murbakh-Gaobandi road would have been their quickest land route, the fact of their not having been heard of at Charak, Murbakh and Mogam near which places the road runs, I am inclined to think the mutineers made their way cross country till they got on to the road to Ashkanan. From the 10th instant I was engaged in collecting evidence and recording statements. In this work I received much assistance from Captain Durham and Mr. Johnstone. The Deputy Governor has proved himself a most incompetent person. He gave me practically no assistance in collecting evidence and I have already shown that he failed in his duty to follow up the mutineers. I have been unable to find any evidence incriminating any of the local people of participation in the crime. I am not yet in a position to assign with any certainty a motive for the attack on our representative and our sepoys and can only assume that it was due to German intrigue or to a desire for revenge on the part of the ringleader Rais Hussain, a man greatly feared by his compatriots, even by the Chief Haji- Khan. A third theory is that one or more of the debtors of the Khan Bahadur may have entered into collusion with the murderers to first kill the Khan Bahadur and afterwards raid bis house. I am inclined to favour the first theory, namely, a German plot. I regret that owing to lack of time I am unable to submit a more detailed report, but I hope to be in a position to furnish one at an early date. Enclosure No. 5. Dated the 16th April 1916. From—M b. J. Johnstone, Quarantine Medical Officer, Lingah, To—His Britannic Majesty's Vice-Consul and Assistant Resident, Lingah. 1 have the honour to record herewith, for your information, the following account of the mutiny of the Deputy Governor’s Tangistani Tufangchis which occurred at Lingah on the 6th instant.1 At 12-45 p,m. on the 6th April, while in my house, I heard the report of a rifle shot followed a minute or so after 15 or 20 more. They seemed to have been fired from the other side of the town and in the direction of the Consulate. About two minutes after I heard a great deal of firing going on in direction of the quarters of the sepoy guard and about five minutes later in the fort itself. A large number of people were now running past my house to get out of the town and on enquiring from them as to what had happened was informed that the Tan^istani Tufangchis had revolted and were attacking the fort. Shortly after this, I was informed that the Khan Bahadur Agha Badr had been wounded in the arm while in his coffee shop and had been carried home. I went down to my dispensary to obtain dressings, &amp;c., with the intention of proceeding to his house, to attend to him, when my house was fired on from the direction of the huts, situated in front about 50 yards off, and which commanded the only door by which I could leave the house. I had a rifle with me and replied to their fire. While this was going on I received information that Khan Bahadur had been badly wounded in the abdomen that Aghas Ali and Ibrahim had been killed and that the sepoy guard had been wiped out. I then collected my servants and dashed with them through the door into the street and after making a circuit reached the Khan Bahadur’s house. I found five sepoys of the guard there, two of whom were wounded. The Naik in charge informed me that they had been attacked by tufangchis while in their quarters and that four of their number had been killed, that they had killed two of the enemy. The sepoys had brought all their rifles including those of the dead men away with them also some boxes of ammunition. I took the spare rifles and having obtained three more from the son of the Khan Bahadur I armed my men with them. I had the three doors of the house barricaded and sand bags erected. Three of my men were sent to bold the 4 ‘ Burj” situation in the bazaar and which commanded Khan Bahadur’s house. The bodies of Aghas Ali and Ibrahim had been brought in. They had been riddled with bullets in the head and body. Khan Bahadur was sinking rapidly. He had been wounded by a bullet which struck his arm penetrating it and passing into the abdomen and out at the back. On enquiring he informed me that Rais Hussain had fired the shot. He expired at 1-80 p.m. At about 2 p.m. Tangistanis were seen coming in the direction of the house. Two were seen by me at a distance of about four hundred yards under cover where they stayed for about 15 minutes and then withdrew. At about 2-SO p.m. Messrs. Cafctersell, Britto and the Postmaster arrived at Khan Bahadur’s house, I having sent word to them to come there as I could defead the place. Also had the sepoy who was on duty at the Consulate Office brought in. Shortly after arriving at Khan Bahadur’s house I had despatched a telegram by a sailing boat to you and the Resident, Bushire, informing you of what had occurred, but after going a short distance the boat was unable to make Hen jam owing to the unfavourable weather and returned to Lingah. By 3-30 p m. all firing in the town had ceased. The Deputy Governor came over to Khan Bahadur’s house and informed me of what had occurred at the fort. M e then visited the quarters of the sepoy guard where we found two badly wounded sepoys who were removed to the fort. We also found the bodies of two sepoys and one Tangistani Kaid Hussain. All the ammu nition accoutrements, &amp;c., found there were removed to*'Khan Bahadur’s house. I then went with the Governor to the fort where I saw the body of Rais Hussain also one wounded tufangchi, Muhammad Ali, who had been found and brought in by the Deputy Governor’s tufangchis and who stated he had been wounded by Rais Hussain. I heard from Mr. Cattersell and the Deputy Governor that Muhammad Ali Khan, Rais of the Customs tufangchis, was still at the Customs House. The' Deputy Governor told me he feared to arrest him, as he did not want to have any further bloodshed that Muhammad A i Khan would for certain put up a good fight. I sent Ibrahim Naum, a Customs employee, to him with a message from me to come to the fort. u lammad Ali declined to come with Ibrahim iNaum and sent word bafck to me to send one of my men to him, I sent one of my Quarantine Barrashis andthey both went straight to my house. Muhammad Ali after a time came to see me at the fort where I questioned him about what had occurred. Said he knew nothing at all about it that he was asleep at home when the shots were fired and had rushed off to the Customs House, where he stayed with Mr. Cattersell, I sent him back to my house and told him to remain therej After this I heard that two other Tangistanis had gone to my house to take refuge there. I stayed at the fort that night and next morning went home and disarmed these three men and put a guard of local men, whom I had armed, over them, I also sent for the Tangistani Tufangchis of the Customs and disarmed them but let them go back to their work. The Customs launch returned with mails from Henjam at 4 p.m. on the 6th instant and telegrams were made out by the Deputy Governor and myself. Mr, Cattersell informed me of his intention to leave for Henjam by the launch and the telegrams were entrusted to him. Mr. Cattersell boarded the launch at 7 p.m but the launch did not leave Lingah till 4 a.m. the next day. , On the evening of the 6th, the Deputy Governor at my request wrote to the Shaikhs of Moghu and Charak informing them of what had occurred here and asked them to arrest the rebels if they made in their direction. The letters were despatched by sailing boat the next morning. Enclosure Eo. 6. No. 103, dated the 16th April 1916. From—M r. W. It. Howson, Assistant Resident and His Britannic Majesty's Vice- Consul, Lingah, To—The Officer Commanding, 94th Russels Infantry, Maskat. I have the honour to inform you that, on Thursday, 6th instant, at about 1 p.m., No. 1363 Naik Chote Singh and eight other sepoys of the regi ment under your command were sitting in the hut occupied by the Lingah Consular Guard and were suddenly attacked by a party of mutineer Tangistani Tufangchis of the Deputy Governor of Lingah. Two men with rifles rushed into the room and four others fired on them through the open doors. The sepoys succeeding in seizing and killing one of their assailants and shutting the doors against the remainder who maintained a hot fire, the four sepoys remaining unwounded replying through the doors. After about an hour the enemy disappeared. I regret to inform you that No. 3770 Lance-Naik Kanaya and No. 4197 sepoy Kanaya were killed and No. 1807 Lance-Naik Balwant Singh, No. 4198 sepoy Mohanlal and No. 3811 sepoy Sivla were severely wounded. The sepoys were taken at a disadvantage having had no previous warning. The building was utterly unsuited for defence and their rifles were locked up in the Arms Hack. Under the circumstances, I consider that they did very well in seizing and killing one of their assailants and in causing the remainder to leave the building and eventually abandon the attack. This attack was part of a concerted plot, mutineer tufangchis simul taneously murdering the British Agent and his two brothers and attacking the Deputy Governor in his fort. The three wounded sepoys are progress ing favourably and are not in danger.L *2 J In Any further communica tion or. this subject, please quote No W. tj^Cf/Q 1 1916 &amp;ma K aiid address— The Under-Secretary of State Foreign Office, London. iff K J The Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs presents his compliments to the Undersecretary of State for — — and, by direction of the Secretary of State, transmits herewith cop of the under-mentioned paper.

Gough has arrived here for Kermanshah. Wali is sitting on the fence as question of Kut is still hanging in the balance. It seems better that Gough, instead of waiting until it is feasible to go through Pusht-i-Kuh with an escort from Wali, should now go with Grahame to Ispahan and proceed thence to Kermanshah. As regards escort at Kermanshah, I am of opinion, after discussing question with Gough, that he should have not less than 25 men in peculiar topographical conditions of Kermanshah Consulate. Indian Cavalry must have poor reputation on Kermanshah side in view of the behaviour of last Kermanshah escort ; and having regard to unsatisfactory bahaviour of certain Cavalry Regiments with this force, I suggest that question of providing British regulars or Yeomanry escort for Gough should be considered. If all goes well on Tigris, it should be feasible for them to proceed via Kut and JVlondali a little later on. Gough could hardly reach Kermanshah before June 1st. Above is submitted for consideration of His Majesty’s Minister and Government of India, and Army Commander who is also requested to say whether escort finally decided upon must come from India or can be supplied from Borce “ I) ”.

From— Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Sykbs, K.C.I.E., C.M.G., Bunder Abbas, Po qhe Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. It is imnortant that Russian Consul, who is considered to be quarielsome and tactless, should not return to Kerman before British Consul. He is most anxious to’start as soon as possible and is enquiring about our dates. If Cox approves, matter could perhaps be arranged by appointment of Howson to Kerman. He is liked by Persians, understands the complicated situation and is on the spot. With the sanction of the Chief of the General Staff and. Cox, Withers could act for Howson. Por political reasons it is most undesirable that the Russian Consul should accompany Mission which, owing to its size, must, moreover, move in two parties. Best plan would be for Russian Minister to instruct Russian Consul to start fortnight after Mission. It might perhaps be pointed out by Minister at Tehran that Mission moves slowly but that if Russian Consul passed it there might be risk of robbers. Addressed Poreign ; repeated Sir P.

Have to-day received letter from O’Connor, April 17tli, giving result of an interview with Zair Khadir and Shaikh Hussain at which latter made the following proposals :— (1) Immediate exchange of British prisoners against Tangistan prisoners. (2) Khans to give formal assurances of friendship to the British Govern ment in return for assurances of friendship from us. Their assurances to include promise to abstain from intrigues with German subjects or agents. (3) Shaikh Hussain’s money, which was attached, to be returned, also some smuggled tea belonging to Zair Khadir. (4) Shaikh Hussain asks that route via Ahbuti (Ahmadi ?) should be reopened. Khans add that they cannot give up Wassmuss as he has been their guest so long, but suggested {a) that he should be allowed to find his x way back on the receipt of an assurance from us, or {b) failing such assurance, he should remain as their guest till end of war; in this case they will give an assurance that he shall indulge in no further intrigues in propaganda. O’Connor adds that he ventures to note that settlement may be possible on these lines ; he has told Khans that he does not think we shall be able to give any assurance of safety to Wassmuss for his journey. I imagine second proposition will not commend itself to Government as it would result in Khans escaping all punishment for their crimes. This condition is no doubt crux of matter as far as Khans are concerned. I venture to think that it would be advisable to tell Khans that if they like to hand over British prisoners to us now, we will be pleased to release Tangistan prisoners in exchange, but that if they do not do so, it will be worse for them ; that as they have been dismissed from their Khanships and outlawed by Persian Government as a result of their misdeeds, it is impossible for us to give them any assurances even if we desired to do so.

Please refer to my telegram No. 37 F. of the 16th April. Heron informed me on April 18th that his levies had fought as well as lie expected, though when enemy charged boldly across open in superior numbers they failed entirely to hold ground. {Note .—Eighteen Punjabi sepoys on same occasion fled straight to Koh-i-Malik Siah and reported that whole force had been killed or captured.) In a tight place Heron thought that levies could not be relied on, but he thought also that their superior pace made them useful for scouting and the seizing of advantageous positions. They proposed on the day before the fight to parley with enemy and demand restoration of all flocks. A man who fought most prominently for us was Juma Jelal, last joined Jemadar and notorious outlaw. At 7 a. m., on April 20th, Heron heard from Sipeh by telephone that Baluch from Narmeshir had come to take away families of Ali Shah’s clan and were looting telegraph office. Message suddenly ceased. According to Heron, Ali Shah had probably come himself. This was apparently not repeated to Officer Commanding, Robat, as it, should have been. 1 replied, sending copy to Wikeley giving my opinion that the cavalry (viz., two troops and machine gun section under Captain James and Lieutenant Wahl at Hehaneh) had an excellent opportunity of w iping Ali Shah out if action were taken quickly supposing Ali Shah had really returned that day to Sipeh to carry away his property. Officer Commanding, Robat, concurred and ordered James to comply with Heron’s recommendation. Heron reported about 10 a.m. to Officer Commanding, Robat, and myself that, according to a Consulate Ghulam (who wms ej&gt;soldier) and his escort Huffadar Idu Khan, Levy Jemadar, had been reproaching the Erahuis for killing their brother Muhammadans, and that many levies had only fired in the air on April 13th. Heron regarded Jemadar Mulla Sadiq, brother of Russian Ghulam Bashi, as absolutely to be trusted and Jemadar Juma and Tara Din Gurgich as perhaps to be trusted, but (thought that) Idu Khan and Nazarjan (e#-Jemadar postal sowars and British protege since mission days) were hoping that Jehind would not be defeated or the Izzat of Baluch and Brahuis would be lowered. Heron accordingly concluded that most of his levies were thoroughly untrustworthy and might even be capable of treachery. In a separate telegram No. 227 C., I am sending copies (of) proposals made by Wikeley and my reply. It will appear from these that Wikeley does not even know the composition of horse levies at Sisran, These are Baluch retainers of settled Sardars and cultivators themselves while Brahui camel sow r ars are Nomad graziers to a man. 91 Telegram P., No. 227 C., dated the 22nd (received 23rd) April 1916.

In Major Heron’s conclusions I concur and consider that Captain Bennett should not take military measures against Ali Shah until the levies at Dehaneh are disarmed and rendered powerless for mischief.I recommend that all levies at Dehaneh except those which Heron consi ders absolutely dependable should at once be disarmed by the troops there. You will please inform me whether any military measures will be required in Sistan as a result of this action and whether these levies at Girdi should not also be disarmed before Pigot and his 50 rifles leave that place. Ends. Wikeley also sent following to myself, copy to Officer Commanding, Nasratabad, Sistan :— Begins. 873, April 20th. If you agree with my proposal regarding disarmament, simultaneous action should be taken by troops in Sistan. Addressed Consul, Sistan; repeated Officer Commanding, Nasratabad, Sistan. I replied as follows. Addressed to Heron; repeated Officer Commandingj Robat, Officer Commanding, Dehaneh, dated April 20th :— Begins. Colonel Wikeley, in his 373, dated April 20th, has asked if proposal regarding disarmament of levies has my concurrence and has suggested simultaneous action being taken by troops in Sistan. With the whole of this ill considered proposal 1 disagree most emphatically. There are no Brahuis among levies now in Sistan. I oppose at the same time proposal to disarm a single Brahui at Dehaneh. These levies were engaged to fight Germans and their following, and their loyalty was severely tested by being set against Baluchis only in their very first engagement nevertheless both in Captain Wise’s affair and in Captain Bennett’s they did not do so badly considering that they had received practically no military training at all. In the affair of the afternoon of April 14th, Baluchi Levies, 50 strong, attacked about 250 raiders and defeated them most satisfactorily. All that is wanted to convert this force into useful fighting unit is strong leadership^) and determination in weeding out unreliable men. Captain Bennett, with 5 rifles and 117 levies, managed to defeat 700 determined raiders and I am surprised that any hesitation should have been shown to-day in a force of 70 cavalry, two machine guns and about 100 infantry against Ali 8hah Khan with perhaps a following of 100 or 200 Sarhad, even supposing there was a chance of our 200 levies at Dehaneh siding with them. Even if it were certain that most of the levies were likely to become affected against us because we were attacking a tribe which is as a matter of fact at feud with themselves, it would, 1 consider, be most inexpedient at this particular juncture to throw our troops into direct conflict with them. It will amply suffice to order suspected men to return to Sistan. This I have already done and I can deal with them here perfectly well. The political effect of Colonel Wikeley’s proposal would be disastrous tbrouo-hout this country and even if we carried it through without considerable bloodshed we should become the laughing stock of Persians and Afghans. It is unnecessary to point out that we should not be able to regard our lines of communication safe as we have not enough regular troops in the country to look after them. Government of India desire that a large military police force should be raised in this country for the special purpose of reducing rebellious and plunder ing Muhammadan tribes to order. In this force a Sarhaddi Contingent is to be incorporated, but how can we ever enlist a Sarhaddi if Sistam Biahms cannot be trusted ? The Chageh Levy Corps is recruited from these same Baluchis. There are I daresav hlack sheep among them but it is not held, I believe, that the great majority 'aredisloyal^or unreliable. Apart from all this the maintenance of our corps conduces to peace and order s.mply because of the good wages which we are disbursing in a time of scarcity. This policy we cannot discontinue now and I see absolutely no necessity for contemplating such a step.95 Telegram P., No. 233 C., dated the 22nd (received 23rd) April 1916.

Under orders from the Chief of the General Staff, General Dyer, on March 21st, asked my opinion about Sistanis and Hazaras. Hollowing is gist of my lengthy reply :— (1) Gurgich and Brahuis will serve us loyally against Germans. Naruis (Sarbandis ?) and Sanjaranis, though behaving well, cannot be entirely trusted until their Sardars join our side w r hole-heartedly. {Note .—I was at that time pressing Sardar Khudadad Khan to join Dyer at Robat and was not certain that he would do so.) All these Baluchis are drilling contentedly under 106th Hazara Pioneers instructors but cannot remain under their tutelage when their own olficers become efficient. (2) Hazara Levies under Thorburn have given trouble about coming south of Neh. Probably many of them will refuse to join military corps. One or two companies, however, can be raised and they will certainly give tone to whole force. If other Persian-speaking trained soldiers cannot be got, a sprinkling of Hazara regulars among these Baluchis is desirable. A misleading impression of my views is given in General Dyer’s telegram No. A. 7, dated March 24)11], to Chief of the General Staff. 1 am sending copies by post. My opinion at present is that Sistani Baluch are more reliable than Sarhaddi. Many have joined in raids. We must weed out officers recom mended by Sardars but there is good material among' them. Wise agrees with me, I believe. Blackwell and Thorburn think that we can get a large number of suitable Hazaras lor service in Southern Persia, though they would not go to India. 96 Teh gram, No. 38 F., dated the 23rd (received 24th) April 1916.

He found no Baluchis there. Proposal to disarm levies has evidently been abandoned by Wikeley who sent me following on April 21st Begins. 378 X. Presence of levies at Dehaneh Baghi is not considered necessary for military purposes as regular troops at Dehaneh have been considerably increased. These levies might, I recommend, be placed elsewhere. On Labi-Baring-Bandan line, for instance, thev will be better employed. Ends. Claridge, who is under orders to take command at Dehaneh, is of the same opinion as Wikeley evidently. Wikeley has now been asked by me how in view of the possibility of the Germans in disguise approaching from east or west all tracks and wells within Dehaneh area can be watched without levies. I got a private telegram from Heron yesterday saying that correctness of mv views was accepted by him.

There might certainly be risk for small party in these circumstances. There is really no cause for anxiety in Sistan and Kain. Levies are perfectly contented.

From—The Director, Persian Gulf Section, Indo-European Telegraph Department, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment. I have the honour to forward, for your information, a copy of a Beport on the Evacuation of Kerman, submitted by Mr. J. W. Tanner, Superintendent in this Department. Enclosure. Report on the Evacuation of Kerman Station submitted by Superintendent J. W. Tanner. Preliminary. To understand clearly the events which lead up to the evacuation of Kerman, or, to be more correct, the expulsion of the British and .Russian colonies from Kerman, it is necessary to understand something about the principal persons concerned. (1) The Governor-General of Kerman provinces, Sardar Zaffar, a Bakhtiari. He was sent to Keiman, 1 understand, by request of the British Minister, Tehran, and was supposed to be strongly pro-British. Beyond giving us guards for the Telegraph and Bank buildings and for the personal protection of the Manager, imperial Bank of Persia, and myself during the last lew days in Kerman, and providing us with an escort to the coast, he did absolutely nothing for us or for the British cause. He was exceedingly prolific in promises out never translated his words into actions. I think everyone in Kerman, except perhaps the British Consul, was convinced that the Governor-General was taking money from both sides. A neutralk 91 V, e releiK milem iDces, “partKi, iealW iepp iimsffi iv: ie0 subject, who was in a position to know and in whom I have great confidence, when discussing the matter told me most emphatically, “ I know he is doing so”. (2) The “ Karguzar ”, Mostam-ul-Mulk. The Karguzar is an official appointed by the Persian Government to faci litate business between Persians and Foreign subjects. This man was strongly anti-Foreign and later became more particularly anti-English. Instead of facilitating business with foreigners he impeded it by such acts as instructing Persian debtors how to declare themselves bankrupt with regard to their British creditors, and sending a Parsi debtor to take “Bast ” (religious sanctuary) in the house of a Persian Mulla. Finally no European merchant could deal with him and requests were made by the British and Bussian Con suls for his dismissal. But this man had a father-in-law in the Foreign Office at Tehran, and for two years or more it proved to be beyond the powers of the British and Russian Ministers in Tehran to obtain the dismissal of this obnoxious official. Reference to my weekly and other political reports during the years 1914-15 and 1915-16 will show that I was continually representing the danger to British interests accruing through this official being allowed to remain in Kerman, and my reports throughout the summer of 1915 intimated that he was politically active in the German interests, and was doing our cause much harm. (3) Hossein Ali, “Mofatish ” (Inspector) of the Post-office. This young man, speaking French fluently, was sent on a tour of inspec tion of the Post Offices throughout Persia byM. Molitor, the Belgian Post- Master-General of Tehran. Soon after his arrival in Kerman he began to mix in political matters. He was strongly anti-Foreign. In the first interview that I had with him, before there was any trouble in Persia he suggested to me that it would be better for Persia if all Europeans cleared out of the country and left Persians to manage their own affairs. This man was a great friend, I believe a relative, of the Karguzar. After he had succeeded in dismissing the Post Master of Kerman, he himself always opened the post-bag, took out what letters he liked, and, accompanied by the Karguzar, took them to the so-called German Consul’s house. I reported these matters to the Director, Persian Section, and that this Inspector was mingling in political matters, and was becoming a source of danger to us. M. Molitor replied to me through the Director, Persian Section, “ J’ai parfait confiance en lui ”. The sequel will show that this confidence was not justified. The Rais-i-Mo’aref, the master of the boys’ school set up in opposition to the C. M. S. school. This man was strongly “Democratic” and actively anti-British. (The term “ Democrat ” in Persia implies “ revolutionary ” or Anarchist. Thus the political murders committed in Tehran in connection with the start of the con- The Rais-i-Mo’aref was close friends with the K.arguzar and the Post Office Inspector, and attended all seditious meetings in Kerman. (5) The Gendarme native officer. The Swedish officers with the hulk of the Gendarme force left Kerman in the spring of 1915 leaving some 60 or 70 men under the charge of a native officer. This officer soon displayed anti-British proclivities, and at our ren nest, he was relieved bv another native officer sent from Shiraz. TOuuru tuat uruu^Liu ouujvy v*.*.**^— .... , •« ° ~ i J « -rri n i f anm &amp; tvri hPft. Be regarded himself as the servant of the Germans, sending detachment -of Gendarmes as escort with any German who travelled Irom Kerman.The Gendarme force in Kerman was not under the orders of the Governor* General, and he professed to have no control whatever over it. He also said the Gendarme officer openly opposed him, and applied to Tehran that the force might be withdrawn from Kerman entirely. Several times in my weekly political icpoits I called attention to the dangerous pro-German activities of this Gendarme officer. (G) The Rais-i-Tahdid was also mentioned as having taken an active part in the events that led up to our expulsion from Kerman. I had no dealings with him and am not aware what part he took. (7) Herr Zugmayer who came to Kerman as the German Consul, but held no exequator and was unable to obtain one from Tehran. The Governor-General at first refused to permit him to enter the town arranging a house for him outside the wall. But after threatening to use force if necessary to prevent the German from taking possession of a house in town he withdrew his opposition when the German showed a bold front, and with drew the men he had posted to bar his progress. The Governor-General also, at first, refused to permit the German flae being hoisted, but the flag was actually flying over the “ Consulate ” for several weeks before we left Kerman. Herr Zugmayer, some years back, spent some time in Baluchistan as a naturalist and visited our Panjgur station. He is said to have a knowledge of the Baluch language and to possess first class maps of Baluchistan and Sistan. He occupied himself in Kerman with enlisting men, and kept posters on thefolfowingclasses S - eWhelelUVltlnSmeat ° a i ) P 1 J' to him for employment in (a) Men with their own horses and rifles.—Pay Krs. 240 monthly.

H err Zugmayer “played the game ”. lam not aware that he took any action against us. In several cases in which complaint was made to him of the unruly or t reatemng conduct of some men, particularly some Arabs in his employ, he replied politely promising to prevent a lecurrence of the acts complained of. Moieover, as will be seen later, he acted, or professed to act, as a restraining influence on the revolutionary party who demanded our expulsion. ° Section II. Events that led up to the evacuation, tv + ^ ^ “ ornin g of Tuesday, December 7th, I was awakened by the shots that killed Tarukh Shah, cousin of the Agha Khan. ^ the eity without an armed escort^He himseH, afewTay^ before his assa° s ina° “They^a'tmf Wood”. ^ ^ ' retu ™ said laughingly It appears that on the evening of the 6th December he went to the eitv and Visited a certain “ Seyed Iftikar ” who persuaded him to stay to dmuer and to sleep at his house that night.

It seems to be a well-established fact that thf murderers, alter committing the deed, took refuge in the German Consulate. Parukh Shah in a moriband condition was taken to the house of nnr Assistant ourgeon P. G. Stemhoif. Dr. Dodson, the C. M. S. doctor was called and agreed with Dr. Steinhotf that notning could be done to save the wounded Smi’eon °S, led t ' V ° ‘ 0U ? atte '' belD S sllot - same evening, Assistant cMlfn° on &amp; thl rn ft ^ Uonsulate when the Governor-General was caning on the Consul with reference to the murder.Dr. Steinhoff afterwards came and reported to me that to his surprise there was evidently no intention on the part of the Governor-General to apprehend the murderers, who were said to be well-known. Recognising that if this were the case the lives of the other British subjects would not be safe, I interviewed several members of the British Colony, and it was agreed that I should see the Consul and impress upon him, on behalf of the colony, the necessity of strong action being taken to appre hend the murderers. Accompanied by Dr. Steinhoff I called on the Consul on Wednesday, 8th December, and laid these matters before him, pointing out that things were developing badly in Kerman for the British cause. The local Persian newspaper was daily vilifying our country and stirring up bitter feelings against us. The German was posting lies on every gate of the city [the latest being that the English and Russian Ministers had fled from Tehran and that they had reached Kasvin wdth their respective colonies. That the Baluchis had captured 6,000 British (not native) soldiers, that the Turks were about to retake Basrah and that the Bank of England had been destroyed.] I concluded by asking the Consul if we — the British Colony — could do anything to strengthen his hands. The Consul replied that he had done all he cuuld think of but that he could get nothing done. The Governor-General was lavish in promises, but when action was required he failed to take it, requiring explicit orders from the Cabinet at Tehran before doing anything. Such orders were not forthcoming, hence nothing was done. It was decided that the Governor-General should be invited to meet representatives of the British Colony at the Consulate on Friday, the 10th. I reported to representatives of the colony the results of my interview with the Consul, and the colony drafted a message to His Britannic Majesty’s Minister through the Director, Persian Section, explaining the situation, pointing out the danger that was looming ahead, and asking that the Consul’s hands should be strengthened and that urgent and explicit orders should be wired to the Governor-General instructing him to take immediate and urgent steps to apprehend the murderers of Farukh Shah and to take such other action requisite for maintaining order in the town,, assuring the safety of British subjects, and the maintenance of British prestige. On Friday evening representatives of the colony met the Governor- General at the Consulate. . As spokesman for the party, I put the following points to him and quote his replies thereto :— I That our fellow subject and friend, Farukh Shah, had been murdered in his Governorship, and that, although the murderers were well-known, no steps had apparently heen taken for their arrest. X pointed out the danger that must inevitably arise to other British subjects if this murder was left unavenged, or ignored, by the representative of the Persian Government. I asked°him to offer a reward for the apprehension of the murderers. He replied that he was doing all in his power. He said he had sent men in several directions following up clues and hoped soon to make some anests. He accepted my suggestion and said that next morning the town should he placarded with notices offering a reward of Krans 3,000 for the production of the murderers of Farukh Shah, either dead or alive. II. I requested him to call out the Persian subjects who were being enlisted and armed by the Germans, asking him Against whom are men being armed ? If against Persians, then you, as the representative of the Persian Government, must interfere and compel their disarmament. If they were being armed against Foreign subjects, tden again he should, interfere, as Persia is not at war with any country, and no foreigner had a right to arm Persians against another Foreign friendly nation. I asked him if he knew what would happen to him, supposing he went to Germany and tried to enlist and arm Germans against Germans or against1G some nation with which Germany was at peace ? He replied that failing; orders from Tehran he could do nothing in this matter. Moreover, the affair was now too big for him, as the Germans had as many men as he had, and if he acted against them there would be much bloodshed. I retorted that it was scarcely possible to dam a river when it was in flood hut it was easily confined at its source. The arming of the German retainers had been carried out under his own eyes and he had taken no steps to prevent it. III. T asked him to arrest and deport the Karguzar, Inspector of Posts, Rais-i-Mo’aref and others, and to get the Gendarmes removed from Kerman, arguing that these were matters within his power as Governor. These people were working against the peace and welfare of his Governorship; it was his business to maintain order and to arrest all sedition-mongers, and special powers or explicit instruction were not required. He replied that as regards the individuals named he could not arrest them without clear and explicit orders from the Cabinet at Tehran. But as regards the Gendarmes he had already requested their withdrawal, and orders had been received for their transfer to Ispahan and that they were now engaged in selling their furniture, &amp;c., by auction. IV. I asked him to stop the Germans from placarding the town with their lies regarding the internal affairs of Persia. I produced, and Dr. Stein- hoff read, one of their latest notices in which the statement was made that the English and Russian Ministers with their colonies had fled from Tehran. I asked if he believed that this was true ? He replied that he knew it was untrue. I pointed out that, being posted on the city gates, these notices had, or appeared to have, his official sanction and were doing British interests incalculable harm in this city. In reply he promised that he would prohibit the placarding of the notices in future, and that if they were posted he would order the police to tear them down. V. We asked him why he permitted the local paper to vilify our country in the manner it did almost daily. He promised to send for the Editor as soon as he got back to his house, and prohibit the publication of such articles in future under pain of confisca tion of the paper and printing press. He insisted that the Manager of the Bank and myself should not go about without an armed guard, saying that he would not be responsible for our safety if we disregarded his request. (After this we were both accompanied by armed Bakhtiaris whenever we left our houses or offices.) The meeting then dispersed under the impression that some little had been done towards improving our position in Kerman. Our hopes were doomed to disappointment. The same evening we heard that Yezd had been seized by the Germans, and learnt that the Gendarmes auction sale had developed into a political meeting. When the auctioneer “ put up ” the first article, a priest stood up and called down the curses of God on whoever bid for the goods of the 3endar- merie force. He said, “ These men were engaged to defend us, it would be a sin and a shame if they were permitted to leave. The Govern or-General only wanted to get rid of them so that he could have everything in his own hands. The Foreign Consuls were backing up the Governor-General in this matter and it would be an everlasting disgrace to natives of Kerman if they did not oppose the departure of the Gendarmes Other speakers followed in the same strain. Then a request was made for volunteers to join the Gendarme force to oppose the expulsion of the Gendarmes. Many were enrolled. I am not aware whether rifles were served out to them or not, but in the matter of uniforms they were told that they could fight as well in plain clothes as in uniforms. As night drew on many people who had attended the “auction” wished to leave and go to their homes. Many of them were prevented doing so, almostforcibly, by the Gendarmes who had prepared, and now served out, dinner for a very large party. Here a peculiarity of Persian revolutionary movements should be noticed. In other countries revolutionaries are compelled to attack Government offices and threaten, or take possession of, the seat of Government before they can gain the points for which they are contending. In Persia it is only necessary fora crowd to assemble in some building or garden, and, for some inexplicable, perhaps psychological, reason, the Governor-General, or even the Shah if he is concerned, trembles with fear and becomes utterly incapable of coherent thought or energetic action. Thus the Persian Constitution was won by a big crowd assembling in the British Legation in Tehran. The Governor-General of Kerman, though a half-civilised Bakhtiari, was no exception to this rule. His own Secretary told me that he was “ walking in his garden trembling like the leaves of trees ” and vowing what he would do when this affair was over. He took no action to save the situation. He did not attempt to disperse the assembly in the Gendarmerie, neither did he prevent the assembling of a much larger crowd next morning. A few Bakh tiari, with rifles, across the road leading to the Gendarmerie would have effectively prevented a big crowd congregating there. But he did nothing, not even when emissaries from the Revolutionary committee (formed of and by the persons named in the first part of my report) went to the Bazar and compelled the shopkeepers to close their shops and go to the Gendarmerie. Throughout the day the agitation was kept up, deputations from the Gendarmerie were sent to fetch Persis, Jews, Mullas, certain Khans, represent atives of all trades and even school children. A deputation sent to the Governor-General obtained from him a telegram addressed to the Cabinet at Tehran withdrawing his opposition to the Gendar me force, and requesting that it might be permitted to remain. By this time the speeches in the Gendarmerie, of which there was a con tinuous flow, had taken on a different complexion. Newspapers from Shiraz had reached Kerman telling how the Gendarmes there had acted towards the British Colony. The questions now put by the speakers were, “ Are we less than the people of Shiraz ? Are we not as patriotic as the other towns of Persia ? Can we not do as they have shown us how to do ? ” The meeting was continued throughout the night. Next morning, Sunday, T)ecemher 12th, together with the Manager of the Imperial Bank I was asked to go to the Consulate to meet the Governor-General. At this meeting the Goyernor-General told us that he could not stand aeainst the will of the people. He could fight one man, ten men, 100 or 1,000 men but he could not fight against the whole city, and he was compelled to do whatever theywished. They had sent him a deputation dur.ng the mght Sting that all English and Russians should leave Kerman He professed W ' Aelnless in t h e matter and said that he was compelled to agree to their . demands. They were now preparing an ultimatum to this effect to be present- e“m on his return, but he would guarantee our lives and safety as far as The Governor-General, it will he seen, had no intention of protecting us if we remained and we could not protect ourselves. Moreover it was now cenerallv known that the Germans had seized Yezd and taken the Rn i prisoners, and that they would arrive in Kerman in a few days time to do the BameOim^. compplled to ace ept the Governor-GenoraTs intimation that we had to leave Kerman. He promised to provide for hi ' 3 if a ^ to send a sufficient escort to see us safely to the coast VVe^aske^hirnff^e would P^^Aidl'maUeV saving thattlmtown wa^ now in the hands of the ’’ (Representatives’of ihe people) and that they would doubtless make all arrangements.18 .'i H 1 I intimated that I wished to proceed to Sistan with all the telegraph staff. The Governor-General said that this was rather difficult as only camels could go that way and his sowars would not be able to accompany us. Moreover, the Baluchis w 7 ere raiding, and the presence of our large party would be sure to attract them, but he would see what could be done in the matter. # At the Consul’s request, Mr. Taylor and I conveyed the news to the other Europeans that we were to clear up and to assemble at the Consulate with whatever luggage we wished to take with us. Section III. The Evacuation. The remainder of Sunday was spent in collecting and arranging for the disposal of Government and private property. Mr. Chase took down and packed all the instruments except the set actually working, the intention bein^ to take them with us to Sistan. On Monday morning, December 13th, soon after I reached the office a deputation from the “ Millet ” came to me with a note from the Governor- General saying that this committee had been sent to take over the tele°raph office from me, and requesting that I would hand over everything. Similar letters and deputations were sent to the Manager of the Bank, the Doctor of the C. M. S. hospital, and the Master of the C. M. S. school. The Karguzar and others took over the Imperial Bank. The Bais-i-Mo’aref took over the C .M. S. school, and another committee took over the C. M. S. hospi tal. The Governor-General also wrote me that he had heen informed that I had caused several of the instruments to be dismantled and requested me to replace them on the table to save trouble with tiie “ Millet ”. I had no option but to acquiesce. The committee appointed to take over the Telegraph Office consisted of the Inspector of Posts {vide page 1) and two or three Persian Telegraph clerks. av l r f ( l u ^ e ^ a , c ,°Py 011r store list 8 showing the instruments and stores that we had on hand, but wffien the list was produced they said that it was too derailed and demanded a summary. Finally, the number of instruments on eacn table was counted and entered on a form, thus: One double current translation table with (so many) instruments ,, and so on. comm “f ‘• Miner” ^ ° f P ° Sts *° be si ^ ed b y the « day u it was brou ' ht back and returned to me with the remark “ The Millet say that they have not given receipts for anything they have taken over, not even the money in the Bank, so why should they give you receipts?” Mr. Chase, after taking a list of the contents, sealed up the instrument cupboards. But the Inspector of Posts broke the seals, saying ' We will seal things up if we wish them sealed At the first test on this morning the lines were found to be interrupted quite close to Kerman and the Gholam (Lineman) had been sent out. He returned about noon in a very bedraggled condition, limping and his clothes badiy torn and bringing with him a large cloth full of broken insulators and shawls with winch the wires had heen tied together. He said that he had been beaten and abused by men watching the line, and told that he would be shot it e again ventured under the line. (After this we saw nothing of the YIth Sub-Section Gholams, who did not venture near us again.) I took him to ti e instrument room where the committee was assembled, and introduced him and his load as the first fruits of the “ Millet ” in Kerman, and an example of their acumen in expecting to earn revenue from a Telegraph line which they had ordered to be destroyed. J a he day was spent in sending to the Consulate tents and stores and a few of the records and books, also pads and other stores likely to be useful in oistan. Mr. Cane cleverly concealed the 12 departmental rifles in a tent and19 got them away under the very noses of the committee, the ammunition was also got away in the same manner. Dr. Steinhoff sent his medicines, cupboard and hired furniture to the office where they were stored in the “ mirror room ” with the office and hired furniture brought from my house. It had not been possible to give translation on the instruments since the morning, the committee objecting to our touching the instruments, and the lit es were totally interrupted on both sides when we handed over. Hosseinhoff, a merchant of well-known pro-British sympathies, was shot at this day in the Bazar, his arm being broken by a bullet. At about 12-30 a.m. that night, whilst sorting out and packing my official and private papers, &amp;c., I heard someone at my front door. As there were no servants in the house, I went to the door myself carrying a hand lantern. On reaching the porch I saw by the light of the lantern that the large double doors, which I had double-bolted an hour or two before, were wide open and that I was looking down the muzzles of three rifles held to the shoulders of three Gendarmes, who stood in a row on my doorstep. They instantly pulled their triggers and I thought that I was practically a dead man. The rifles clicked, but were evidently not loaded. I rushed towards the men and pulled the doors together, endeavouring to bolt them. There was something between the doors so that they would not bolt, so I braced myself against them and shouted for my wife to telephone for Bakhtiaris to come from the office. This she did, and after a time I succeeded in fastening and barricading the doors. A party of Bakhtiaris came and slept at my house for the remainder of the night. I presume the incident was carried out with a view to frightening me, and to show me that although I went about guarded by Bakhtiaris in the day time, yet the “ Millet ” could reach me if they wished. Mr. Cane, Mr. Chase, Dr. Steinhoff and Mr. Bottomley went to the Con sulate on Monday about noon and did not return to the office again. On Tuesday, 14th, the Consul gave orders that all British subjects must sleep that night at the Consulate. I went to the office for a short time in the morning and made final arrangements about the menial staff, preparing a list showing the ^ each of them. The “ Millet ” undertook to pay them according to this list. At the request of the “ Millet ” and the Governor-General it was arranged that Local Service Signaller Mr. A. Alexander should remain at Kerman, staying in the office as our representative. I instructed Local Service Signaller Mr. 0. W. Edwards at Bam to arrange for camels to take him to Sistan along with ns, and to endeavour to arrange for about 100 camels for our transport beyond Bam. I cave Probationer Z. Minas, a Persian subject, the option of remaining at Kerman or accompanying us to Sistan. He begged to be taken- as his b th , his only relative in Kerman, was leaving, and he was afraid to remain alone. I took his case to the Consul who agreed to his accompanying ns. . The two P. C. clerks, Persian subjects and employees of graph Administration, begged to be permitted to accompany us Oae o . on Monday night, had been robbed of everything he possessed, except clothes that he wore. The Governor-General’s Secretary told me it would he VnVhlv dangerous for them to remain. I could not undertake tne Of taking them and referred them to 'ent agreed that they should accompany us. Later on the Governor General se again specially to me requesting that these two clerks might he taken away with us, or he would not be responsible for their lives. , On the Monday ^to the^rvention P 0 f the Governor-General^on Tuesday Mr. Taylor informed us that we were to be rnniugatthe Bank, 1 sent in cheque, towithdraw aU my balances, and included a cheque for the balance ot the Government cash which stood to my credit.Luckily this cheque got through with the others, and I received Krans 11,918-80 Government money (about £200) in cash. This sum in silver coin (notes were no longer current) was too heavy to take with me on a Ion? journey, so J asked Mr. O. Brandly of the Oriental Carpet Manufacturers, a Swiss subject, to take it over together with my surplus private cash, and to give me drafts on Bombay in exchange. He agreed and at once took away the coin, which it would have been very unwise to have kept in my house overnight. Later, Mr. Brandly told me that he had given the German “ Consul ” an undertaking that he would not take over any British Govern ment cash or property. But I persuaded him to accede to my request and gave him a letter to cjver him in which I referred to the cash as my private funds. He then gave me drafts on London and on Bombay. On Tuesday night the whole of the British Colony slept at the Consulate and all the luggage was assembled there, the Governor-General supplying a large Bakh- tiari guard. Mirza Ahmed Khan, the Superintendent of Persian Telegraphs had been seized and imprisoned by the “Millet ” two or three days before this! I sent to the Governor-General and asked him to do what he could for him* and before leaving Kerman had the satisfaction of knowing that he was released and was then in the Governor’s palace. Mirza Ahmed Khan had been very true to us aud gave us much useful information. He consistently refused to permit the German to send messages in cypher, as only properly accredited Consuls are permitted to do, although he was compelled by the Minister of Telegraphs, Tehran, to accept messages in cypher for the German —contrary to the regulations of the Persian Telegraph Administration. I think Mirza Ahmed Khan’s services worthy of some recognition at the hands of the British Government. He already holds a British Medal for good work on construction of the Central Persian Line. On Wednesday morning, the 15th instant, the Consul formally forbade me to attempt to go to Sistan, saying that the country was full of raidin'* Baluchis and that I should be taking the whole party into certain disaster if I went that way. He could not and would not consent to it and would 'ive me this order in writing. 6 The Governor-General also sent to me saying that he could not provide me 'with escort or transport for that direction. The Baluchis were up in force and be could not give me sufficient men to protect my party against them! and again his men, not having camels, could not proceed beyond Bam. I then tried to arrange to travel with the Russian Consul, who had said he would proceed towards Meshed, and who had previously aoreed to our travelling together m that direction. But I found that he had been unable to arrange to go by that route and was compelled to go to Bunder Abbas with the Lnglish Colony. It amounted to this tha,t the Governor-General would provide only one escort, and that all of us had to travel in the same direction. The committee of the “ Millet ” that had taken over the Telegraph Office sent to me for the keys of my stores, &amp;c. I offered to give them up if they would give me a receipt for them. This they refused. Thereupon J wrote to the Governor-General asking him what was to be done and who was to be held responsible for the property at the Telegraph Office. He replied that he was sorry he could not help me, but that the “ Millet ” was now all-powerful and we must all do as they requested, therefore it was advisable for me to hand over the keys. I did so, telling the committee what I thought of people who forcibly took possession of other people’s property without giving an acknow ledgment. ° Mr. O. Brandly, the Swiss subject mentioned above, had been in com munication with Herr Zugmayer, I understand at the request of our Consul with reference to our departure and Zugmayer had promised that he would do his best to prevent any attack on “ the women and children ” if they left soon. About midnight on Wednesday nephew, came to the Consulate to Zugmayer to the effect that he could night Mr. Branuly, accompanied by his say that he had received a note from Herr not understand why the British Colony^as taking so long to get off, they were incurring great danger, the people were getting impatient and beyond his control, and he feared that he would not be able to keep his promise regarding the women and children if we delayed much longer. He suggested that the women and children should be started off at once. We sent back a reply that we were quite prepared to start as soon as transport was provided. We had intended and hoped to start on Thursday morning, but that the Governor-General had not, as yet, produced a single animal for' transport. Also we had no intention of sending the women and children first. When they went we snould accompany them. Mr. Brandly at once took this reply to Zugmayer. The general idea was that Zugmayer wished to separate us from our womenfolk so that an attempt might be made to take the men prisoners, following the example of Shiraz. Thursday afternoon and evening camels, mules, and donkeys hired through the Governor-General were coming into the Consulate. Contracts were ^ade at the rate of Krans 90 per donkey, Krans 120 per camel and Krans ISO per mule for the journey to Bunder Abbas vi(\ Jiruft, the hire being paid by the British Consul. Messrs. Cane and Chase took up the duties of transport officers, had the lugsage sorted out, and the camel caravan, with an escort of Bakhtiaris, started at sunset. Next morning, Friday, December 17th, the British Colonv started from the British Consulate, the Russian Consul with his Cossacks joining us and accom- panving us. Every man openly carried a rifle and supply of ammunition, there were 39 rifles in all, not including the Bakhtiari guard. At Sarvestan we found Mr. C. W. Edwards from Bam with his wife and three children awaiting us. They had been practically expelled from Bam, a committee taking over charge of the Telegraph Office, They went on with us to Bunder Abbas. Nothin 0 ’ of interest occurred on the way except an alarm at midnight on December 25th, when the Bakhtiari guards fired several rifle shots and some of them ran through the camp calling everyone to arms. All the men turned out except the Armenians, who said they got ready and remained in their tents until they were called. It appears that some six or seven men had been seen by one of the out posts, and that when they did not answer the challenge the guard fired on them, whereupon they fled. Our party consisted of:— Race. Men. Women. Children. Total. English • •• 10 7 6 23 Russian • •• * 10 • • • 10 Greek ... • » p 1 • •• 1 Armenians* • •• 8 5 7 20 5 Indian sowars • • • 5 ... • tt Persian (Nawab) • •• 1 • •• • 0t 1 Total • • • 35 12 13 60 , 2mM , 2 w . me u, i ehiltoD, BritUh .ubjeofi 1 Turkiab .abject i remote ,ub i ecM -22 Including the Bakhtiari and Afshar guards mounts, there were in the caravan 92 camels, 26 mules, 132 donkeys and about 100 horses, total 350 animals. The day before reaching Bunder Abbas was a pouring: wet day, other wise fine weather was experienced throughout, although naturally it was cold on the mountains at this time of the year. We reached Bunder Abbas on January 10th and found that Vice-Consul Mr. W. Howson had made all possible arrangements for our comfort. One of the Russian Cossacks having developed small pox on the road, it was not considered advisable that any of the Russian party should embark on the transport. They were therefore left at Bunder Abbas. An Armenian clerk employed in the Bank, his wife and three children went to Bushire, and the remainder of the party embarked on the hired trans port “ Bankura ” on the morning of the 14th January. We dropped Colonel Ducat at Maskat on the 15th and reached Bombay on the 20th. The Tele graph contingent, except Assistant Surgeon Steinhoff, left Bombay on the 25th on the Departmental Cable steamer “ Patrick Stewart ”, and arrived at Karachi on Friday, 28th January 1916. J. W. Tanner, Superintendent, Indo-European Telegraph Department, Dale in charge of Kerman Sub-Division, Persian Section. 123 Dated Bunder Abbas, the 17th (received 26th) April 1916 (Confidential). From— Brigadier-General Sir Percy Sykes, K.C.I.E., C.M.G., Inspector-General, South Persia Military Police, Bunder Abbas, To—The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Simla. A month has elapsed since the Mission charged with the raising of the South Persia Military Police landed; and it is therefore time to give some account of its proceedings. 2. The British officers, four in number, assembled at Delhi and the Indian officers and staff met them at Karachi, from which port the Mission sailed on the British India “ Teesta ” on the 13th of March, reaching Bunder Abbas on 16th March. 3. Unfortunately the afternoon was stormy but it was decided to carry through the landing programme. H.M.N.Z.S. “ Philomel ” fired the salute of 11 guns as the Mission left the steamer and a second salute when it landed. The first salute was answered by the Persian Warship “ Persepolis ” and the second by the shore battery. I am informed that four salutes constitute an exceptional compliment. The reception on landing was unprecedented, the bazaars and Customs House being shut in honour of the occasion. Upon landing I was greeted by His Excellency the parya Begi, Governor of the Ports, who had come from Bushire for the purpose, and by the Deputy Governor of Bunder Abbas. The former in a short and very friendly speech said that, as representative of the Persian Government, he welcomed me in my official capacity and also as a very old friend. The reception formed three sides of a square, the north side being occupied by Guards of Honour formed by fl.M.N.Z.S. “Philomel”, whose band played the National Anthem, and by a company of the 94th Infantry. On the east side were Persian troops flanked by the Cossacks of the Kerman Russian Consulate; and the , population of Bunder Abbas with the notables in front was massed on the western side. After the usual formalities, the Mission was escorted to the British Consulate where the Darya Begi, in a speech to the assembled notables, explained that the policy of Great Britain had always been the support of Persia, and that the present Mission had been sent at the urgent request of the Shah to restore order and peace in Southern Persia. His Excellency23 f concluded by referring to our successful co-operation eighteen years ago S 2 ainst tbe Karwanis and to our friendship. In reply I explained the nature of the Mission. This concluded a reception which, thanks to Captain Hall Thompson, Qammanding H.M.N.Z.S. “Philomel 0 , and Mr. Howson, His Majesty’s Vice-Consul, was a conspicuous success and proved that British prestige in the Persian Gulf is very high. 4. I now turn to the organisation of the Police, The difficult question of pay had formed the subject of much discussion and thought. I did not aim ut competing with German rates as they were obviously temporary, but I was ready to pay a little above the market wage to secure men rapidly. I finally decided to pay as follows :— Infantry ... 10 Tomans. Cavalry (horse and forage found by Gov- 12 „ ernment). Artillery ... ... ... 12 „ Each rank to have an increase of one Toman per month upon the comple tion of drills. Vakils, 6 Tomans extra per month. Deh Bashi, 2 Tomans extra per month. Every Guarantor of a recruit, who had to he a man of some standing, was given 10 Tomans. This fee proved to be most useful. Most of the early recruits were brought in by notables and I agreed to pay Ts. 50 per month to a Bais who should bring in 50 recruits. At present I have twm Bais, both useful men, whom I can send ahead to arrange for supplies, &amp;c. Vakils in some cases brought in 20 men and Bek Bashis 10 men. I have engaged Muhammad Ali Khan, the Governor’s brother, as an Officer and he is working admirably. I am paying him Tomans 100 per month. 5. The day after our arrival the Deputy Governor brought up a hatch of men to select from, and the first day saw the enlistment of 53 recruits. It is true that rumours that they were to be sent to fight at Basrah caused the men to wish to resign, but the Deputy Governor swore on the Koran that they were engaged for Persia only, and. the crisis passed. 6. The drills were held at first outside the Consulate, but on tbe 27th ©f March the Police moved into camp at Naiband. There was serious trouble on the first pay day, but again the Deputy Governor helped us and the ringleaders w^ere punished by him and dismissed. Since that date the men have been graduallv acquiring habits of discipline and the elements of drill. On 28th March the Persian flag was hoisted with some ceremony at the camp, and later the men were duly informed of the successes of the Persian Govern ment at Kerman, Lar and Shiraz. !■ jj' Onlv 25 men have been engaged for Cavalry, as practically no horses can be bought locally and forage is both scarce and dear; and hitherto but few recruits have been engaged for the Artillery, the men berng apparently afraid -of working guns. 1 hope to engage suitable gunners at Kerman. S The new force appears to he popular as recruits come in as fast as we caB deal with them, the number enlisted in the first month exceeding three hundred, after the elimination of some unsuitable men. Some of the best recruits hail from Jalabai. In 1898 1 engaged eighteen men from this •village to look after camels during my journey across Bashakird n Inch was undertaken in connection with the murder of Mr. Graves. The son of my old headman and others have joined the force, owing to this past connection. 9, The men, although childish at times, are steadily improving and will, in time, make a useful force, more especially when supported by Artillery machine guns, armoured motor cars and aeroplanes. Of couise trouble may be expected from time to time, but the men will pass more and ** influence of their officers and their non-commissioned officers. I do not pio| o.e to recruit more men at present owing to the difficulty of marching untiaine men up country and the scarcity of food.10. The question of officers is a very difficult one. My feeling is that at first, it is wiser to train young Persians of suitable class and education and mould them into our ways, rather than to risk the introduction of European ised Persians trained at St. Cyr. or elsewhere in Europe. Such men would consider themselves the equals in every way—if not the superiors—of the British officers and would probably attempt to undermine their position. It seems to be better to train men to occupy positions similar to those held by Indian officers in the Indian Army, rather than to engage men who would be apt to resent their subordinate position and be difficult to assimilate. At the same time this view does not necessarily preclude the use of Persians with European education when the force is moulded into shape. 11. I now propose to deal with the political aspect of the Mission. Its arrival, with numbers which were greatly exaggerated, was followed by the decidedly useful rumour that 30,000 British troops were ready to support the Kawam in case of need. The actual assistance of 4,000 rifles was magnified by the capable Deputy Governor to 10,000 in the case of his son, who is Gov ernor of Minab, and to 20,000 in all other cases ; the number of cartridges ran into many millions. As a result the Kawam found his enemies ready to submit and won a bloodless victory before a single rifle had reached him. At Shiraz the Ear success caused the city to return to its allegiance. The rebel Gendarmes were arrested and the Germans were seized. The arrival of the Mission and its numbers were also reported in Kerman in an exaggerated form, its objects being announced by the Persian Government in a somewhat ambiguous fashion. Not long afterwards the German movement collapsed both in Kerman and Baluchistan. In Europe it would be absurd to claim credit in such cases, but tk e Deputy Governor and other Persians are convinced that the despatch of th© Mission has been accepted by the Persians as a clear indication that Great | Britain means to adopt an active policy; while, coinciding with Russian successes in other parts of Persia, military activity in Sistan, and the ex pedition of the Kawam supported by Artillery, rifles and money supplied by the British Government, it has helped to produce the happiest results. 12.

If Wa^smuss is still there and has any authority, he will not agree to exchange any one but Listemann for O’Connor; he might possibly agree to exchange one of others, say Perguson, for Eisenhut if Khans would let him.^ If however, Wassmuss has disappeared (as rumour says), I think it is just as likely Khans would exchange O’Connor for Khalu (Zair ?) Hossem as for Eisenhut, in fact probably more likely as they care nothing for latter. There is possibility of our securing release, I think, if instead of remaining quiescent we show some sign of activity here.

Your telegram of the 3rd March, No. 300 D. S. Thorburn is out with levies opposing Baluchi raiders. Blackwell prob ably arrives in Sistan to assume command cf Hazaras on April 13th. General Dyer left Kacha Koh April 6th with expedition against Damanis and expects to be at Galugan about April 27th. If this expedition succeeds it will, I think, be perfectly safe for Dyer to march on Bam and Kerman where he may arrive before Sykes. In all probability Sykes will have left Bunder Abbas long before Thorburn can arrive via Karachi. May he, therefore, accompany Dyer as far as Bam at any rate and either continue to Kerman where his Consular experience will be of great service or try to join Sykes from Bam ? If desired, he could take a contingent of levies from here. 51 Telegram P., No. 33 F., dated (and received) the 14th April 1910. From—His Britannic Majesty's Consul for Sistan and Kain, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla (repeated to Baluchistan, Meshed and Tehran). At sunset April 6th, Juma Jehil with Baluch lashkar of 300 or 400 Ismailzais and Haji Gulab with some Afghan Gurgich suddenly appeared at Gerageb, 12 miles from Dehaneh Baghi. At midnight they proceeded northward and began to round up Sistani flocks which were collected at a spot 50 miles west of Girdi and 60 miles south of Neh. The first contingent started homeward on about April 11th with 45 flocks. Our Sipeh, Girdi and Nasratabad detachments are endeavouring to encounter band. At Sipeh we have 100 infantry (and ?) 150 camel sowar levies and at Girdi one troop of cavalry and perhaps 80 levies. Forty infantry have also gone out from Bobat. Juma Jehil, like Mir Jehind, refused to meet Dyer at Kacha Koh, while Haji Gulab actually guided a German into Chakhansur last month. Our Sipeh contingent on morning of 12th was close to enemy. Later news has not yet come in. 52 Telegram P., No. 34 F., dated the 13th—14th (received 14th) April 1916. From—His Britannic Majesty's Consul for Sistan and Kain, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. Fahreh Telegraph Ghulams, who had deserted to Germans, now write to Inspector of 7th Sub-Section, Dehaneh, asking to be taken back into employ. Levies, they say, are deserting Germans who have been ordered back to Kermanshah. If Inspector can employ fresh men, I think he should do so, but I don't know whether this is possible. All the past service of these deserters at any rate should be forfeited. Ali Shah, subsidised line guard headman, who is anxious to get himself styled a Persian official, should also be prevented from returning to sipeh. Officer Commanding has been advised by me to confiscate his crops, ibere is no difficulty in settling another tribe at sipeh and there should be peace there under new police arrangements.3 Ali Shah’s brother, Mirza Khan, whom we got released from Biriand last Bummei, is actually raidiug with Juma Jehil— 01 % as he says, protecting the telegraph lines !

Please refer to the telegram, dated April 11th, from Consul, Sistan, with reference to Dyer’s proposed movements. Owing to collapse of Germans, who are now fugitives, any movements from the direction of Sistan on Bam or Kerman, is, in my opinion, strongly to he deprecated as unnecessary and liable to be misunderstood. Sardar Nosrat is in touch with me and I will be able to reach Kerman about the middle of June if in time. Thorburn can join me, with some levies, via Bam. 54 Telegram P., No. 38 C., dated (and received) the 14th April 1916.

Would strongly deprecate ^(arman) P(arma) bringing Bakhtiaris now that rebels and Germans have fled from Kerman. Their lack of discipline and general behaviour are outrageous and there has been considerable risk of their quarrelling with Indian escort and military police apart from bad moral effect on police. K(arman) K(arma) would probably consent to forego Bakhtiari under altered conditions if he were aware that half battalion of infantry, one squadron of cavalry and two batteries have been allotted (to ?).

PERSIA AND CENTRAL ASIA. CONFIDENTIAL. 1998 [ 86316 ] 916 [May 6.] Section 1, Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received May 6.) 511) (No. 36. Confidential.) Sir, i Tehran, March 24, 1916. WHEN concluding my despatch No. 157 of December last, I contemplated giving a separate report on the impending negotiations for a treaty of alliance, but so little progress has been made with those discussions that, although the suggestion of alliance has been by no means without effect on the political events in this country, they can, I think, be sufficiently dealt with in the general sketch of events down to the fall of Farman Farma’s Cabinet which I have now the honour to submit. As you will remember, the reconstructed Mustofi Cabinet came into existence under a pledge to put into practice a policy of actively benevolent neutrality to us, and, after a certain amount of coaxing from us, eventually made the formal proposal for a treaty of alliance. The proposal was, however, scarcely made before Mustofi-ul- Mamalik, worked on, no doubt, by the Turkish and Austrian representatives and, probably with more effect, by such personages as Moin-ul-Vizareh, Hakim-ul-Mulk, Mukhbir-es-Sultaneh, and Sbahab-ed-Dowleh, took fright at his own temerity and withdrew it, and this on the eve of the day on which he had promised to communicate to us the terms of his proposals. We have been told more than once that Mustofi. was all along playing us false, but I cannot accept this view, and I feel that his conduct on this occasion was only another if crowning instance. of his incurable indecision and vacillat on. Almost from the very day of its formation Mustofi’s Cabinet had been unsatisfactory. Farman Farma, it is true, did what he could at the Ministry of Interior and succeeded by the vigour of his messages to the provinces, especially in the south, in inducing a good many important personages, who appeared, to have been seduced by German gold and promises, to pause before definitely committing themselves. But his efforts were hampered by unwilling colleagues, and on more than one occasion, as for instance when Darya Beggi requested that the Minister of Interior s telegrams should be signed by the Prime Minister and Sipahdar so as to give them additional weight, the latter would not support him. In Tehran itself where the Government was virtually under the protection of Russian bayonets, the inactivity of the Cabinet was deplorable. Mustofi could not even bring himself to dismiss Colonel Edwail, the commandant of the gendarmerie, and Major Frick of the Second Regiment, and peemed to think that he had exhibited extraordinary courage in ordering the dismissal of Maior de Mare and the other Swedish officers who had openly taken active part with the Germans in Western Persia. Still less would he get rid of the Democrat members of his Cabinet, such as Hakim-ul-Mulk and Mustashar-ed-Dowleh, the latter of whom as Minister of Telegraphs was well known to be still assisting the Germans 3y giving information as to the movement of Russian troops and spreading false reports of defeats inflicted on them. Sipahdar’s waywardness and unreasonable demands for money wherewith to construct the Persian army of his dreams also troubled the harmony o the Council. Mustofi himself did nothing at all, professing that his time was occupied in preparing the Persian draft for the treaty of alliance and endeavouring to reconcile pu ytt,' «*»— !*-«-• ,h s ft IS- alliance must have been exceedingly distasteful and only the convmtaon that hostihty to Russia and her Ally spelt ruin to Persia can have compelled him to ad°Pt th at policy We may take it as certain, however, that his innate Russophobia made him an e y prey to suggestions that, after all, he had made a mistake as to Russra’e power to take military measures in this country, and that a Turkish army of formidable n e re- under the leadership of Marshal von der Goltz Pasha, was at hand to drive t e y out. In such circumstances, to conclude the alliance was onl y N™ s Nfiment of the war on the locally weaker side, but was to do so against the religious se the country. Again, the circumstantial stories industriously set * “A’b DowJeh defection to the Turco-German cause of such important chieftains as Soulat^d-I) the Yali of Pushti Kuh, Nizam-es-Sultaneh, and even the Sheikh of Mohamme [2579 /—l]2 largely believed, and, as a matter of fact, although Nizam-es-SuItaneh was the only traitor, the loyalty of Soulat and the Yali was in doubt for long after Mustofis fall. The Bakhtiaris also were clearly waiting on events, and a message, which I believe now to have been forged, from the Ilkhani and Ilbeggi, reminding the Khans in Tehran that “ the Bakhtiaris are Mussulmans,” is said to have been the immediate cause of Mustoffs ^ abandonment of the policy of alliance. Be this as it may, the alleged message was regarded as exceedingly ominous by so good a friend of the two Powers as Akbar Mirza, and it is a good sample of the influences brought to bear on the wavering mind of the Prime Minister. In the provinces, also, to all appearances the tide haa not yet turned against the Germans. The Committee of National Defence, protected by a considerable force of gendarmes and mujahids stationed at various points along the road to the capital, was sitting at Kum, and with the aid of Mirza Suleiman Khan, the late under secretary of the Minister of the Interior, was announcing itself to Persia as the true national Government, denouncing the Cabinet, and particularly Farman Farma, the Minister of the Interior, as traitors to the Shah and country, and calling .on all true patriots and Moslems to rise together and drive the hated Russian and British invaders from the fatherland. Some material successes were also scored by the Germans, who succeeded in obtaining the evacuation by our consuls and colonies of Sultanabad (9th December), Yezd(17th December), and Kerman (14th December). These achievements were cheap enough, as, failing any support from the local Persian authorities, our colonies were powerless, but they served to provide a few facts wherewith to leaven the mass of lies of victories over Russians concocted by the Kum Committee. That some of the German agents were prepared to try conclusions with their mixed forces of mujahids and gendarmes against the Russian regulars has been proved by correspondence seized at Kum, and it was well established also that a concentration of numerically formidable forces was taking place at Burujird and Kermanshah, where it was believed that the Lurs and Kurdish tribes under the influence of Nizam-es-Sultaneh—who is credibly reported to have received 80,000b from the Germans—were ready to fall on the Russians. The occupation of Hamadan also by the Russians took longer than was generally expected, and, generally speaking, the change of scene which the arrival of General Baratofs army was to accomplish was by the middle of December by no means so apparent and complete as to inspire Mustofi with the confidence and determination required to execute his new policy. When, therefore, his Highness confessed that he could not ca'rry out the alliance policy and offered to resign, he was only reflecting the general sentiment that a change of person at the head of affairs was inevitable, and the Russian Minister and I welcomed the prospect. Ain-ed-Dowleh having put himself out of court by his refusal to join Mustofi, there were at this moment but two candidates, viz., Sipahsalar and Farman Farma, and both had been busy trying, each in his own way, to improve their chances with great assiduity, Farman Farma by currying favour with the Shah and Sipahsalar throughout the pro-Russian Persian party, headed by his jackal, Amin-ul-Vizareh, and inspired and financed by M. Kozminski, who, in addition to his official duties as the Russian commercial agent, is agent for Sipahsalar’s estates. Between the merits of the two candidates there could scarcely be any comparison. Farman Farma is a man of considerable intelligence, determination, and knowledge, whereas the Sipahsalar’s qualifications can be fairly well appreciated from the epithet of buffoon once applied to him by Sir Walter Townley, and therefore, though I was for a moment disposed to think that it might be politic to allow the “ Russian ” candidate a short innings and so clear the ground for a long Farman Farma Ministry, I thought that, in the still uncertain state of affairs, it was imperative to take the better man, who was, moreover, cordially supported by my Russian colleague. I also reflected that Farman Farma himself would have been greatly chagrined had we invited him at the eleventh hour to make way for a rival who had taken but a minor share in bearing the burthen of the difficult times behind us. Accordingly, when the Shah proposed to M. de Etter and myself that Farman Farma should be entrusted with the reins of office, we warmly supported the suggestion, and the new Prime Minister entered office on the 24th December. I cannot pretend that the composition of the new Ministry was wholly reassuring. Farman Farma at least got rid of the enemy elements that had figured in the late Administration, and two of his appointments, that of Sirdar-i-Mansur to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, and of Prince Abkar Mirza, Saram-ed-Dowleh, a son of the Zill-es-Sultan, as Minister of Public Works, were excellent; while Ali Kuli Khan, Mushaver-ul-Mamalik, could be counted on to carry out instructions; on the other bs-; 1^- Lilians to 1 PK1 uk s; jits ii:#, wig-' f lat a point so qtefl, the sit ■gitj that was .i jniiffl CUllSS W Si i sooner wi ilimpart) Kinski, t If type P Sipahsalar’shand, the appointment as Minister of Finance of Yamin-ul-Mulk, an ex-Mustoh with all the vices of the class who acquired a knowledge of European financial administration under M. Naus, was ^ most unfortunate, and was certainly made to facilitate the Prime Minister’s schemes of personal profit—it is universally accepted that his Highness took 12,000 tomans to make the appointment—while the presence of the Sipahsalar-i-Asam (to which title the Sipahdar was promoted for not receiving the Premiership) did not make for harmony in the Council Chamber. Farman Farma made a good start by dismissing Colonel Edwall and Major Frick from the gendarmerie and placing Major Nystrom in command of that force. He redoubled his efforts, and with a very large measure of success, to prevent the secession of the great tribal chiefs to the rebel and German cause, for which alone we owe him a great debt of gratitude. He took great pains to imbue the Shah with the conviction of the absolute necessity of contracting the alliance, and finally, on the 16th January, he communicated to us a draft of the Persian proposals for that purpose. By this date, however, the situation had been very radically improved by the vigorous action of General Baratof, whose troops had practically driven the hostile elements behind a line drawn from Tehran through Yeramin, Kum, Sultanabad, Hamadan, Kangavar; while a small party, led by Germans whose mission had been to destroy the important bridge over the Sefid Bud at Menjil had been satisfactorily dealt with at a point some 30 miles north-west of that village. From a military point of view, then, the situation in Tehran was perfectly secure, and it was this very state of security that was one of the main causes of Farman Farma’s undoing. So long as the German cause was in the ascendant, and even later during the end _ of Mustofi’s administration, when there was still a lingering doubt whether the Viceroy really intended to take the Persian situation in hand seriously, the native pro-British and pro-Bussian parties were content to work more or less harmoniously for the joint good; but no sooner was the common danger removed by the agency of Bussia than the pro-Bussian party set to work to oust “British” Farman Farma and replace him by “Bussian” Sipahsalar. . . r . Sipahsalar himself, from the first week of the new admmistiation, had been mr from accommodating. He constantly insisted on the fulrilment Oi a half promise made by Mustofi, that 60,000 tomans of the monthly instalment of, say, 140,000 tomans at the then rate of exchange accruing from the so-called moratorium, should be devoted to the war department, and when Farman Farma refused to carry, ouu this impossible demand he made the usual demonstration of annoyance by absenting himself from the Cabinet meetings. On two or three occasions the Bussian Legation wheeled his Hiofiness into line again, and after the understanding for the increase ol the Cossack brigade was reached during General Baratof s visit to Tehran^ (6th January), there was not much to complain'of in his personal behaviour. Very possibly his partisans feared that with his flighty moods he might wreck their schemes The campaign against the Prime Minister was conducted with considerable skill oy M. Kozminski, the Bussian financial, or rather commercial agent, an intriguing officia of the type unfortunately too common in Bussian services, who, moreover, acts as agent for Sipahsalar’s estates,' just as the late Bar^n J^^G'seionded at Ispahan and agent for the Zill-es-bultan. M. JXozmmsKi was eu« g j • fliipripp by Amin-ul-Vizareh, a hanger-on of ^pahsalar s, '’ h o possesses considerable m over his patron. It was recognised by these gentry at once that, as Farman Faima enjoyed the confidence of the Russian Government and the ^’fCtld fnrTaccord- essential to undermine his Highness’s position with t e ussian i,.- j ingly no opportunity was lost of creating friction between the Prune Mimste M ' ^fwould weary you, Sir, to recount how quarrels were fomented between Farman Farma and M. de Etter over such matters as the Mazanderan Pf tr . oleU “ Cors in the light railway from Pir-i-Bazar to Resht and the c angej ^pio^ Etter | iscovered what Bussian sphere—it was in connection with this l • nf which Farman I had long known, viz., the rble that M.

M. de Etter’s abomination or a matter to political corruption is thoroughly web known an 1 . ^ aS M - n i st er by spreading abroad create in his mind a personal a yg s %\fg ^Xmalpractices^ I warned Farman ssrsa&amp;tw h “ [2579 / 1]Highness made matters worse by repeatedly bringing up a request for a guarantee (similarly to that which you had authorised me to give him in very different circum stances, 'but at this period quite misplaced) of a suitable allowance in the event of his having 'to leave the country and a considerable lump sum down as an indemnity for losses^sustained by the pillage of his estates. It must be confessed that Farman Farma himself was largely responsible for his fall. The final act was, however, most farcical. A number of women, paid by agents of the Hussian party, tooiv bast in the old Bussian Legation, as a protest againt Farman Farma’s continuance in office, and his Highness, knowing perfectly well that with a Russian Minister of more experience of Persia, or perhaps I should say more determined to retain him in office, such a performance would not have been possible, took the hint and resigned. In taking this decision there is no doubt whatever that barman Lamia was partly also influenced by his disappointment at the tardy response made by the Powers to his proposals for the alliance, at their failure to allow him to draw on the accumulations of the moratorium, and also at the delay in giving the Shah the personal guarantees (especially those of a pecuniary character) that His Imperial Majesty was led to hope for. His Highness believed that the responsibility for this state of affairs lies with the Russian Government rather than with us, and with the northern provinces of Persia and the capital in virtual occupation by Russian troops, he felt that the predominant influence of Russia would no longer support him, and he not unnaturally bowed to the inevitable. M. de Etter has been very much annoyed by his discovery that the downfall of Farman Farma, whose steadfast support of our joint interests at very considerable risk to himself during the critical time in the late summer and autumn of last year he fully recognised, and whom he readily admits is a far more capable instrument with which to achieve the aims of the two Powers, should have been brought about largely by M. Kozminski and his kind, and it is naturally disagreeable to him that the policy of the Russian Legation should have been thwarted by a Russian official. Though I was pretty well aware of M. Kozminski’s activities, and in particular knew all about his intrigue in the question of the appointment of the governor of Astrabad alluded to above, I carefully abstained from making any accusation against M. Kozminski to my Russian colleague, though I told him repeatedly that the attacks on Farman Farma were largely the work of the Persian pro-Russian party, and that whde it wns true that under Farman Farma corruption was rampant, he must not expect any considerable improvement if Sipahsalar came into office, though probably he would hear less of it, as the stories now poured into his ears would come to me. As for Farman Farma’s unpopularity, on which M. de Etter was apt to enlarge, that was merely the expression of the fear which every strong statesman inspires in this country. I believe that had I enlightened M. de Etter as to M. Kozminski’s intrigues, I should have run the risk of seeing a small rift created in the excellent relations between the two legations. As it is, M. de Etter has succeeded, so he informs me, in bringing about M. Kozminski’s disappearance from Persia at an early date, which will serve as an excellent warning to other Russian officials of the same type. The episode has also been of use in opening M. de Etter’s eyes to the resources of Persian politics, and I do not think that he will again be impressed by so transparent a manoeuvre as the demonstration by bast ” at the old Russian Legation. But I think, as 1 believe does also M. de Etter, that the situation here has not been improved by the disappearance of Farman Farma, but at the same time I doubt very much even if his Highness had not played into his enemy’s hands, whether it would have been possible to have long prevented the Sipahsalar from supplanting him. It may seem curious that in the foregoing sketch I have made so little mention of the Bakhtiaris, but the fact is that although their attitude has caused me no little preoccupation, they have exercised very little influence on the political situation m Tehran. The Khans, both here and in the South, have watched the advance of the Russian troops with uneasiness, and are obviously apprehensive that they may even enter Bakhtiaristan. As you are aware, they signed the agreement with us with little demur, probably they felt that by drawing closer to us they were making their situation more secure as against our Allies, but in the fall of Farman Farma they now certainly share the general impression in Persia that our influence, as compared with that of the Russians, is small indeed. The Khans in Tehran recognise that since the Russians reached Koom and Kashan they are more or less in the position of hostages, while the loss of the Governorships of Yezd, Ispahan, and Kerman, and the proposed return of Eill-eS'Sultan under Russian auspices have irritated the whole tribe. In fact it is the MW 00 ?? ■ft present atk to remain 5situation here which has reacted on our relations with the Khans, rather than the attitude of the Khans which has affected politics in the capital, and there is always the possibility, though I hope it is a remote one, that in a fit of childish vexation the Khans may allow their relatives in the South to listen to the temptings of German agents, or just conceivably may commit the crowning folly of opposing the Kussians. A few of them, notably the sons of Amir i-Mufakin, have actually- lent sowars to the enemy, but the tribe as a whole is in no way involved, and I have succeeded in convincing General Baratof that this is the case. As general in charge of the Bussian operations he has, however, to be more than watchful, and the Bakhtiaris being aware of this are equally suspicious, and I fear that it will be very difficult to induce them to abandon their present attitude of cold distrust. So far they have taken no step which we can hold to be unfriendly, but on the other hand their undertaking by the recently signed agreement to take action against enemy agents has been a dead letter, and I fear is likely to remain so.
