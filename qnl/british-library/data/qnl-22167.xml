From:- Political Bahrain To: - Resident Bushire. (9 Livers dispersed on reaching Muharraq without further aisorder,and situation is now in hand. I consider furtlier rioting unlikely though men may create trouble by refusing to join boats. Shaikh is still at Rumaitha but is fully informed and his attitude is correct. Ke has approved suitable orders. Two divers were killed and four or five wounded. Indian sepoy slight contused head wound. Firm attitude of Bahrain Government approved by merchants who consider weak attitude of Government at Rakba past two years was real cause of outbreak but immediate cause is that divers desire larger advances which merchants have not funds to give. o Enquiries into outbreak proceeding. Behaviour of both Indian and local police excellent. i •*. \*-f^ j.-. i •: ■ ?&amp;***£&amp;3 © r 4. On arriving at the police station it was obvious that the mob Y/hich I had met had returned for a large number of men,armed as I have described,\ms spread along the sea road for about a hundred yards, A crowd of some 1,500 or more persons were watching in a great semi circle to see what happened but Y/ere taking no part in the proceedings,and it was fairly easy to distinguish the rioters and spectators. As soon as the Indians had collected their breath, I suggested to the Adviser that they should rush the right flank of this body and disarm them and,if possible,take some of them prisoners. He agreed and I assisted him in explaining to the sepoys what was required. Ir.Belgrave unfortunately knew no Hindustani and could only communicate with the sepoys through one or t,.o of the N.Q.Qs who happened to know Arabic, This disability also made itself later. The Indians formed up in line and attacked the mob at a smart pace,with instructions not to fire unless ordered to do so. Just as they were about to close in with the mob,Shaikh Rashid,the brother-in-law of Shaikh Hamad,met them v/ith out stretched arms as if to stop them and it is uncertain what his object was. I do not knov; what happened at this moment as my attention was distracted by a burst of fire from the naturs and local police immediately behind me. I did my best to stop this but it broke out again from time to time. It must be remembered that the local forces fire in the air on the slightest provocation and until recently invariably used it as a means of attracting attention. The danger was that they might find the excellent target formed by the rioters too good to miss and had they fired seriously into the mob hundreds would have been killed. When I turned back I found that the rioters were holding their ground but the sepoys presently began to force them to give way after some deter mined scrimmaging and a number of men fled into the sea. It was at this point that the sepoy was wounded,apparently byPolitical Agency, Bahrein, Dated the 30th May *93 2. From THE POLITICAL AGENT, BAHREIN. T© The Hon T ble th a Poli ti caL Ile si dent in the^i; er s ian Gulf , I liave the honour to say that a serious riot took place at Manana on the 26th May and to submit the following report. 2, On Wednesday,the 25th May, I received news from the Adviser that some unrest had been noted amongst the divers at Muharraq. and that a number had gone to meet Shaikh Abdulla bin Isa al Khalifa to ask for enhanced salaf or advance of pay before proceeding to the banks. Shaikh Abdulla was believed to have told them that if they had a grievance they could go and lay it before the Adviser in Manama. 3. Shaikh Hamad was informed of this unrest but instruct ed the Adviser and Shaikh Abdulla to settle it Tf by making the divers hearts good' but did not discuss the matter with me at the Joint Court. He then returned to his distant outpost oi Humaitha. A few men suspected of stirring up trouble among the divers were arrested and brought to Manama and placed in the police lock-up near the pier. On Thursday momii^g the Adviser telephoned to me that Shaikh Abdulla and the mir of Muharraq had come over to see him and ^ to Id him that a number of divers appeared to be moving here and there and that although some had expressed a desire to see bhaiidi Abdulla no disorder had yet occurred. At a quarter to one I received a telephone message from the t Adviser’s head clerk to the effect that a body of 1,500 divers3 . © were said to be proceeding towards his office. As soon as I had finished what I \ms doing,some 5 minutes later, I went over to the Adviser’s office and found that he had proceeded to the police station. I re turned, got into my car and followed him there. Half way along the sea front I met a mob of at least 500 men aimed with sticks,clubs and bars of iron. As a retreat would have encouraged them I forced my way through and some struck at the car with their sticks r &gt; and others shouted 'wagaT* 'Wa^af” or stop,stop. I realised immediately that the situation was serious and that something very different to the divers disturbances of i _ former years was at hand. On arriving at the police station a minute or two later. I found the Adviser with some 3 or 4 local policemen and 3 or 4 naturs and the police station windows smashed into smithereens. He told me that the mob had got there before him and rescued a ringleader arrested the day before. I asked him what arrangements he had made for reinforcements and he told me that he had sent for as many Indian police irom the fort as could be spared to patrol the bazaar and prevent looting. He suggested that we should go to the fort and see what was happening there and we both got into our cars and proceeded there. At the fort I found some 15 couple of Indian sepoys being rapidly fallen in and provided with ammunition. It seemed to me that it v/ould be far better if this force were used to break up the mob and the Dazaar left to the care of the naturs and Ir.Belgrave agreed to this. They were then sent to the police station and after aming ourselves we followed them. The Super intendent ,Qhaudri Sultan Ahmad,was left in charge of the fort with a iev/ remaining Indians and some 20 recruits who were also armed. Ihis body seemed sufficient to control the prisoners and no Id the fort against any attack by a portion of the mob.© n £ 4. clubbing. A running fight now continued along the sea road towards the Agency and the Adviser and I accompanied the police with our cars and the lorry,and the rioters were gradually forced into the sea,except a few who were captured. Two-thirds of the way towards the Agency we halted to reform the Indian police who had been joined by all kinds and conditions of men including Agency ferrashes,the Adviser*s servants and the Shaikh*s hangers on as well as some naturs, armed with every kind of weapon. The sporadic fire of the naturs was stopped and arrangements made to follow the divers to l uharraq. although the latter strewed the sea for a mile,some had found the three jolly boats which had brought some of them to 1 anama and had. set sail in them for Iuharraq. -he tide was fortunately in and I arranged for the Agency motor boat to be brought out and the adviser had two launches sent from the pier. lie collected the Indians and selected a number of naturs and local policemen and followed tiie divers to Muharraq.. 5. On arrival at Muharrac[ he was able to capture some of the rioters but the majority disappeared into the tom by the shortest possible route and the assembled crowds gave them no assistance. A little firing was indulged in by excited naturs but the town was soon under control and order restored. It was now found that at some stage or another not known two divers had been killed and another Yfas found wounded in the chest, dome 3 or 4 wounded have been found since and there are doubtless others who prefer not to dis close themselves for fear of punishment. 6. The Aaviser found obaikh Abdulla seething with rage. It appeared that while returning from Manama he had t o ooat loads of divers and ordered them to return but instead they jeered at him and lifting tap their clothes shook their membra virile at him,which apparently is the highest insult these shores can offer. I enquired by whymammmm 7 5. Shaikh Abdulla had not iamediately turned back and brought word to Manama,but it appears that owing to the high wind the jolly boats were travelling at a high speed and were past him in a minute, lie did,however,send the Amir to give warn ing,but the latter,ofcourse,arrived too late as the men had already landed near the Power House, Shaikh Abdulla also apparently considered it advisable to have at least one person in authority present in Muharraq. 7. Mr.Belgrave went on to Hedd and found that the divers who had gone direct by boat had all dispersed quietly. He left a body of the armed police in Muharraq and returned to I anama. Next morning letters arrived from Shaikh i famsd approving what he had done and authorising drastic action against the ringleaders and giving instructions that certain individuals should be banished. He also ordered that a oer am house known to be/disaffected A for their meetings should oe burnt to the ground,and that a proclamation shn ni d oe issued to the effect that if a sakhKia should refuse to take his 'salaf' or diving advance the nakhuda should bring hi:A be lore the G-ovemmeiit • O. I was surprised at this energetic action on the part of uhaikh Hamad,who had twice run away from much smaller demonstrations in the past two years,and it appears that what really roused him was the insult offered to his brother, hai m Abdulla. It seems His Excellency was furious on hear ing of it and his chamberlain,Abdulla bin Jabar,told Jr. elgrave that had anyone done such a thing to him 'he would have cut him down with his sword,no matter who it ms or June it was. Phis is the sole occasion in three years that I have known ohaikli Hamad to face an emergency and it is odd that so curious an incident should be required to fire his resolution. 9 * 0rL ° aturda y ^e Adviser made further investigations and established the fact that the attack had been organised with6 . G) 8 the principal object of rescuing the ringleader from the police station,but exactly how the Iledd and Muharraq divers were able to combine in this matter is not jek clear. It is unfortunate that the ringleader who was rescued has not been found,an the evidence points to his being the aase cause of all the trouble. 10# On Sunday the Adviser returned to ruharraq. and Redd and informed me last ni^it that all was now proceeding smoothly and that it was hoped that most of the boats would leave for the banks today. Some divers may hold up their boats for a little while,but the departure of some will weaken those who remain and I hope that a week will see the end of this unfortunate incident. 11. The merchants and nakhudas uniformly support the action taken by the Bahrain dovemm6nt,and most ascribe the incident to the weak policy of past years. I have not the slightest doubt that this weakness in the past is the cause of it all, and when it is remembered that these divers number some t thousands of ruffians and semi savages from a dozen different countries without,for the most part,any families present to restrain them,the danger of leniency is at once apparent, particularly when the small number of the armed forces of the State are considered and also the appalling suddenness with which these outbreaks can occur. Sticks and clufts are always at hand and a small crowd may swell into thousands in a few minutes. 12. A word regarding the behaviour of the State forces may be of interest. The Indian police behaved splendidly and though each man had a loaded rifle,not a man fired a shot. Had they commenced firing the casualties would have run into hundreds. The nature were quite prepared to do what was wanted and showed plenty of spirit,and since they receive no training their^discipline must not be judged too harsilly. I did not see any except a handful of the local police in action,but -r.Belgrave tells me that the lance naik ■BHK9 wmmmmmm msBESsmHi7. and two men in charge at the police station effectually prevented the moS from breaking teen into a room which contained a quantity of rifles and ammunition,and in the circumstances it is creditable that only one prisoner was rescued* 13* Altogether,the incident has served as a very useful stiffener to the prestige of the Bahrain Government and the divers have learnt a lesson which they will not soon forget. It must be remembered,however,that the advances have this year reached an absolute minimum, though nevertheless higher than those bbtaining on the mainland,and if any attempt is made to give smaller amounts next year it will be a matter for consideration whether the Government will be justified in making divers go to work for their nakhudas. If the latter cannot find sufficient money to grant an advance that makes it possible for a diver to exist,he will have to release him,though what otter occupation the men will find to support themselves and their families I cannot say. Unless an improvement in the pearl market takes place before next year,the industry will be bankrupt and untold misery caused to thousands who have no other means of livelihood* I have the honour to be Sir, Your lost Obedient Servant, Political agent, Bahrain.GOVERNMENT OE INDIA. ——— Department.

Although soke unrest amongst the divers was apparent on the preceding day no distar Dances on a large scale were apprehended, and it -s suiprising Just so large a number should have been able to collect without the authorities at Manama obtaining prior urn oimat ion. The divers seem to have left Muharraq net from the recognised embarking place but from some side inlet and to have got half way over to Manama before be/ing seen, Pheir object was to release one or two divers who had been arrested, but there is no doubt that the basic cause of the trouble was economic, and that the demonstration was intended as a protest against the smallness of the diving advances. 4s H have pointed out in many dispatches recently, the economic position on the Arab coast is exceedingly serious, It is essential that divers should receive advances to support ii&amp;es&amp;umiLsupport their families during their absence, and merchants, Captain Prior and the Adviser, ana the regular police behaved v-i th admirable restraint . The an naturs are merely watchmen with little discipline or training, while all along the Arab coast the people are accustomed to let off guns in the air on the least provocation, or even merely to express joy. ^he divers, as Captain Prior points out, are a heterogeneous communi(fy —Baluchis, Arabs, negroes, nejdis , Persians, etc.— and are difficult to control; 1 hope however that they have now realised that a resort to force is not the best method of representing grievances. On the other hand so far as economic conditions permit steps wi&amp;l have to be taken to remedy these grievances, though the problem is an exceedingly i difficult one. boat owners and others have not ae capital now to pay customary advances owing to the fact (hat they have been unable to dispose of last year’s pearls.

[ &lt; It is difficult to report on the conduct of the Arab Police during the divers’ riot, as it ocurred so suddenly that there was no time for them to take organised action. Only about half a dozen of the Police actually took part in the affair but they behaved extremely well and, in the case of two men who were in the Police Station,with considerable courage. These two men were on duty in the Police Station when without any warning an angry mob of divers came down the Sea Road and attacked the Police Station. Although the two policemen were unable to prevent the divers from smashing open the outer door of the lock up and releasing one of the prisoners and from breaking windows and destroying the railings they kept the mob back from the office itself until help arrived. If the divers had got into the office, they would have found a number of rifles and ammuni tion which they would have seized and the whole affair I *ftliMT*i) * '1*1 r i HSRSI- 2 - affair would have been far more serious. In recognition of their conduct these two men have both been promoted. When the party of Indian Police arrived from the Fort a few of the Arab Police and some armed naturs took part with them in driving the mob back along the Sea Road and into the sea and they took a most active part in the hand to hand tussles which ocurred. When the mob had broken up in Manama, with several casualties, they gave up any attempts at aggression and the divers fled in boats to Muharraq and Hedd, landing along the shores. During the rest of that day and the following day the Police were engaged in rounding up the ringleaders and within two days all the men except one who actually broke into the lock up were arrested. At outlying Police posts such as Held and Muhar raq there were no disturbances. I consider that the behaviour of the Arab Police was very effective and satisfactory both on this occasion and also during the recent strike which lasted for several days and which was in many ways a more difficult position for the Police to deal with&amp; D.C.Ho:0/111. roll deal &gt;{;moy 9 lahraiiijthe 3rd July 1932, It seam that the .rab police had little to do during the divers riot as most of thorn were either recruits or elsewhere when it took place,in fact only about half a dozen actually took part and these,Hie Adviser tolls me, behaved well,especially tv/o men who wore in the Police Station, These two mm were on duty in the station when tin mob f :.rst came down the sea road and attac'Ded it, Althm^i they could not prevent them from tearing down a door leading nanacd to prevent them from gettixy: into the office .lore they would have found a number of rifles and ammunition, fad tliqy got hold of these rifles M aiion it would have been very serious indeed. b. hen Belgrade got over to huharraq wiiore there were a number of .rah police,the situation was not so cri bical as the divers kid been worsted and were returning to their lairs by tlie shortest possible route.

'mwi«w»c^ar- 5iL H, J* Von Baasewitz, Pattietic newa of the pearl divers comes from the Persian Gulf. Remote from the places where men love to talk with smooth words of world peace and humanity* the defenceless race of pearl divers on the Bahrain Islands in a collision with armed British police detachments have fallen victims in a massacre which ranks beside many deplorable occurrences in India. Moreover, the important pearl fishery on the coasts of these distant islands appears to be reduced to nought and the natives to be threatened by bitter distress in their difficult means of livelihood. Prom ancient times the riches of the Persian Gulf in pearls have been a source of prosperity in the East. Almost all pearls which do not originate in Japan come from the coasts of Persia and mainly from the island group of the ’’Two Seas” (Bahrain) situated on the opposite coast of Arabia. Ihere one hitherto counted some 500 boats with which the natives went to the pearl banks and 15,000 pearl divers. Pull of hardships and dangers was their calling in collecting the shell fish from waters swarming with sharks. They seldom grew old. And often enough in the whole heaps of shells not one was found which had covered a small injury inside the shell by a growth of its mother-of-pearl substance, the coveted pearl. Then the catch yielded no profit. Last year the largest pearl so far known to the world, if it has not become also the most beautiful and most valuable, was found near Bahrain. Many people were able to fill treasure chests, like the Shaikh of Kuwait whose riches in pearls are talked of as a marvel. Indian princes in their predeiicticn/Zt - 2 - predeliotion for valuable jewellery were also good customers for the valuable catches* Recently the whole guild of boat proprietors and pearl divers of the Bahrain Islands was combined into one organization, directed by Englishmen, which replaced the natural risk of the industry incurred by the small enter prises formerly working independently, by a slender fixed wage. For the world crisis cast its shadow even in these circles. The collapse of prices in the international jewel market also affected pearls* Their value sank in 1931 to about one-half the prices attained in the previous year. If it was really desired to stop the continuing decline in the price of pearls, only one means could avail, namely that which people have years ago learned to apply in the case of the immensely increased production of diamonds in South Africa, which is to shut down the whole industry. Quite extraordinary measures were required for such a high-handed move. How did the British actually come into the Persian Gulf? Very few Europeans are accustomed to seek for pleasure or sport these waters overheated by the tropical sun. Merchant ships at best er? route for Iraq and the Persian coastal ports, where moreover in the course of recent years the German flag is most frequently counted after the British. In the course of small naval expeditions to protect the Indian frontiers the British in 1869 had occupied the Bahrain Islands which belonged to Persia. Shah Nafreddin, who did not possess a single vessel which could be utilized in war, could not prevent the last Persian soldiers and officials being sent away a few years later. But when after the world war Riza Shah Pahlevi succeeded in regaining Persia’s ancient independence, in 1927 he claimed back also the Bahrain Islands on behalf of his country as a rightful possession and despatched 100 soldiers there/3- there to proclaim his rights* But the small force returned post haste to Bushire at the sight of threatening British protecting vessels which did not see any joke and since then the decision, if one can still call it so, lies with the L eague of Nations* Without desiring to discuss here how the commissions of the Geneva club of nations appraise foreign rights as against the interests of the British Empire, it may be mentioned that Great Britain in the meantime has developed the Bahrain Islands, like the coast towns of her paid vassal Sultans of Kuwait and Muscat, into strategic naval, flying and wireless bases* Since Great Britain was obliged to evacuate Southern Persia occupied in the war and knows that sooner or later she will also be compelled to give up the Iraq Mandate, these are Great Britain’s rearguard fortresses for the defence of the route to India or - to-day more than previously - on the way to the rich oilfields exploited by Great Britain. Many million tons of petroleum are annually carried to the sea through the Persian Gulf on British account. The Bahrain Islands were to remain shut off from foreign curiosity. They relate in the Gulf that if a small sailing boat should ever become suspect or troublesome there, then, rammed by a gun-boat, it can quickly disappear into the fare well for ever. But the news of the tragic fate of the pearl fishers has, however, penetrated to Persia by an authentic channel. In Menama, the capital of the largest of the Bahrain Inlands, covered with strange tall Arab houses, a native Shaikh rules but he has no commands to give: the British ’’adviser” and financial administrator there entirely relieves him of those cares. A few weeks ago he issued, in turn on instruct!ons/-4- instructions from superiors, the order that this year’s pearl- diving” season” should last from the 15th of the Mahommedan month of Moharram until the 15th of the first Jornada month, which nearly corresponds to the period fro m May to October, and that moreover every pearl diver should receive in respect of this season a fixed wage of twenty-five rupees but every helper who pulls the diver out of the water and assists in looking after the boat only twenty rupees in all. The value of the Indian rupee current in the Persian Gulf is about 1.15 marks to-day and has declined compared with former quotations in relation to the British pound. An intelligible discontent therefore arose among the pearl divers of the Bahrain Islands, and they despatched a deputation of four persons as interpreters of their wishes to the British 'responsible adviser” of their superior Shaikh. But before the envoys had said a word, they were overpowered by the police, beaten, put in fetters and imprisoned. The population began to agitate and the men of Muharrak, a small island situated in the north of the Bahrain gropp, assembled, 2,000 in number, manned their boats and marched on the 20th of the holy Moharram month in procession of protest to the police station of Menama. The Adviser had opportunely made himself scarce and had only hastily given orders to refuse all negotiations. Nothwithstan&amp;ing their strong claim the pearl fishers did not however resort to any violence but shattered only one window and rescued one of their imprisoned comrades, Abdul Wahid. The other three could not be found. They peacefully withdrew, embarked again in their boats and made for their native island with sail and rudder. Precisely at this moment the British consul, warned in the meantime, appeared on the scene, at the head of his bodyguard of armed Indian sepoys (soldiers) and, when the 'adviser” also put in an appearance again, caused a running fifle fire to be opened immediately on the pearl divers' departing boats. The descriptions/-5- 31 descriptions of the native eye-witnesses* who have now come to Bushire, report dreadful details of this shooting. In their desperation the fugitive boatmen threw overboard their severely wounded comrades in order to lighten the load. Subsequently the men brought out of the water five dead and six hopelessly wounded men. It is said that over thirty wounded returned to Menaraa and three dead and many wounded were taken to Muharrak. Sven there the pursuit continued, and if one may believe the witnesses from Bahrain, over one hundred men were arrested and all the houses on the island destroyed. But then, to complete the tragedy of these unfortunate people, there was published the obviously long prepared ordinance of the British administrator instructed by higher authorities* * AI1 pearl fishing in the Bahrain Islands is prohibited **. The state of the market imperatively required a cessation of the pearl output. A few thousand Arab pearl divers thus became victims $&gt;f the world economic crisis. And Shaikh Ahmad, the paid chieftain of the Island of Muharrak, in view of the choice allowed between a purse of gold and a bullet from the barrel of a sepoy’s rifle, was obliged to express his thanks to the British ’’responsible adviser” for the destruction of the traditional occupation of his p»eople’.

Answer to Mr. David Grenfell’s question Bj. 13 dated 2(3th iiovender, 1932. /- serious riot, the reasons for hiich appear to have been partly economic, took place in Bahrain on the 20th lay, in the course of which a mob broke into the police station and released a diver who had been imprisoned. The situation was rapidly brought under control. i1o shots were fired by the Indian police but two divers appear to nave been killed and four or five wounded by sporadic firing by local Arab watchmen. There was no suspension of the pearl fishing, the pearling boats leaving for the banks in the first week of June* 1 see no occasion for further inquiry into the incident which appears to have been satisfactorily dealt with by the local authorities. DUit'AhxDij^iaT&gt;^f ^UiAillUh , Mr. Grenfells Is it true that the casualties rmount only to two ? ere there not a larger number killed in addition to the number seriously injured ? Sir 3. Hoars; The inf oration at my disposal is that two people were killed and four or five wounded. IL ? m *#**#«».Note by Mr.Belg ave. Financial Adviser to the Bahrain Government, on Bahrain Pearl Fishers. *•*♦*# x*** The diving community in Bahrain consists of 3 categories; the shore merchants who do the big buying and selling and who either own or finance the boats, the nakhudas or boat captains, and the large inarticulate mass of divers, illiterate Arabs who wei’C previously cheated and oppressed 'ey their employers, or rather their owners, the boat captains. About 15,000 local divers go out from Bahrain every season and it lias been estimated that about 100,000 men from the whole Gulf are employed on the banks every year. Attempts to improve the diving system met with difficulties. The divers were suspicious and apathetic, the merchants and captains were violently opposed to changes that would loosen their hold over the men and until the present hhrukh succeeded ills father it was considered impolitic to press for reforms. in 1924 His occellency Shaikh Hamad in conjunction with Taj or Daly, who was then Political Agent, and with the support of the Government of India, took the matter in n&amp;nd. Only a very few of the more far sighted merchants, and the Ihia and Sunni gadis, supported the movement, but the reforms were finally pushed through mainly owing to the keen ness and energy of Major Baly. The principal features are as foil owe*- The amount of the advance and the amount of intercut permissible is 1^ id down by law.

Although men who have been diving for a lon t , time are still hopelessly indebted to their captains, and will remain so until they die, the new generation of divers are no longer in the position of slaves. Previously a diver had no redress against his captain, a court existed, but it consisted of boat captains and its reputation was notorious. hvers now realise when they are cheated,and appeal to the courts when they find that the divixig rules are n )t being carried out by their employers. There still remains an influential party of merchants and captains who bitterly resent the improved conditions and who continually try to upset and evade them.
