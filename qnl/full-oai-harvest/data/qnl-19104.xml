It contains 91 named individuals (in Arabic and English) of the Abā al-Khayl (‘Anizah) family of Buraydah in Qasīm, some with birth and death dates, as well as brief biographical information.The table was compiled by John Calcott Gaskin in 1905 and revised by Captain Stuart George Knox, Political Agent at Kuwait, and Captain Francis Beville Prideaux, Political Agent at Bahrain, in 1906. Knox was assisted by ’Abdul ’Azīz-al-Hasan [‘Abd al-‘Azīz al-Ḥasan] who played a considerable part in the affairs of Buraydah between 1875 and 1892.There is also a 'Chronological list of the Amirs of Buroidah belonging to this family' with the periods of their reign, including: Mahanna-bin-Sālih [Mahannā bin Ṣāliḥ], Hasan-bin-Mahanna [Ḥasan bin Mahannā], Interregnum, and Sālih-bin-Hasan [Ṣāliḥ bin Ḥasan]. There is also a note concerning the history of the Abā al-Khayl family.In addition, a section of 'Notes' is included that gives 1907 as the year of compilation, as well as other details concerning the arrangement of the table, including: the omission of distant females, with one exception; 'issue' means 'male issue'; the ordering of children from the same father according to seniority from left to right, with the one female placed at the far right; dates of birth are approximate only; and when the fact or date of death is not mentioned the person was probably alive in 1906.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival item</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023876399.0x000002#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
