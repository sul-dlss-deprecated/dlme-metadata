CONFIDENTIAL. GERMANY, TURKEY, ENGLAND AND ARABIA. The following extracts from, and account of. Dr. Franz Stuhlmann'a recently published work ' The Fight for Arabia between Turkey and England ' are submitted not only because of their intrinsic interest, but also as showing the kind of attention which really thoughtful people are devoting to the Middle Eastern question in Germany. It is the first volume of a series of 'Hamburg Investigations,' edited by Professor Dr. Karl Rathgen (Director of the Seminary for National Economy and Colonial Policy in Hamburg), and Dr. Franz Stuhlmann (Kais. Geheimer Ilegierungsrat, General Secretary of the Central Office of the Hamburg Colonial Institute). The nature of the problems which these writers set out to investigate is indicated in the extract from their preface, and their purpose may be described as the mobilisation of the stores of knowledge already existing in Hamburg and the Hanse towns for the assistance of experts and the formation of public opinion. This volume (which is to be followed by one on Persia) consists of 277 octavo pages of text, 72 of appendices, and maps. P)esides the 69 works enumerated in the bibliography (including English writers like Aitchison, Andrews, Chesney, Curzon, Forster, Hertslet, Rawson, Willcocks, Zwemer), many others are quoted ; the newspapers of the last few years have been thoroughly ransacked, and references are given for all important statements of fact. The result is an extremely well-informed book. Each chapter begins with a historical survey, from the earliest times, of the region with which it deals, the latest date quoted being 10th April P.)16. The newspaper reports—for the accuracy of which Dr. Stuhlmann disclaims responsibility in the preface—are, of coarse, often grossly inaccurate (as in the statement that the Sheikh of Mohammerah has been assassinated (pp. 237, 243, and in the account of rhe lighting in the Aden hinterland, pp. Ill, 139-140). But it is a thoroughly scientific work, and the conclusions which the author reaches are the more impressive because of his careful statement of the historical premisses. The passages quoted below have thus lost much of their force by the process of extraction. A. H. 31st October 1910. S 329 Allamburgische Forsclmngen.

To contribute to their investigation is the serious duty of Hamburg. Here everyone feels that the question so often asked : ' Continental policy or overseas policy ? ' is wrongly framed. What form the distribution of power, what form economic life across the seas, will take, are fundamental questions for the development of the German people, and vitally affect Hamburg and her sister cities on the sea. More than ever the present shows how the future of our economic activity abroad depends upon the political distribution of power. What direction will the extension of the political power and of the economic influence of the great States take across the sea? What are their methods and their objects? The first volumes of our collection will describe this for Arabia and Persia. ' And further, what are the tendencies of development of the great trade of the world in the present day? In what directions will it go? What will be its position in a period in which there seem to be no iixed points ? What will the great markets of raw material be like ? How will import and export trade be organised in a period of increasing syndicates and rings, which, owing to the necessities of the war and the consequences that are to be expected from it, are constantly growing and ever transcending the traditional limits and regulations of commercial and fiscal policy.' E xtract from A uthor's P reface to 1 st V olume (dated March 1916). u It may seem strangely fantastic to busy oneself in the confusion of the world war with so remote a country as Arabia, which is rightly called the most unknown region of the earth. But Arabia is only spatially removed from the war round which all thoughts centre to-day. I hope in the following pages to show what great importance this land has for our Allies, the Turks, and what a gigantic danger lies in it for our chief enemy, England, who is here almost more vulnerable than in Europe. Lord Curzon says ; ' The future of Great Britain will be decided, not in Europe, not even upon the seas and oceans which are swept by her flag, or in the Greater Britain that has been called into existence by her offspring, but in the Continent whence our emigrant stock lirst came, and to which as conquerors their descendants have returned. Without India the British Empire could not exist. The possession of India is the inalienable badge of sovereignty in the Eastern hemisphere.' (Persia 14.) ' For England everything centres round India, and Arabia is the glacis for the defence of India. Evenj blow to England in Arabia icoidd have an immediate and perceptible reaction on India. 1 ' These are the considerations that have led England to aim at absolute supremacy in Arabia, and control of the lines of approach from Europe to the Indian ocean. The Red Sea, and even more the Persian Gulf, are to-day practically closed English lakes, which can only be traversed with England's permission. This condition is hard for us and all other nations to bear. The liberation of the seas from English supremacy is an openlv avowed object of the war. May these lines show how this is to be accomplished in Arabia, and how greatly we desire then 1 a strong allied Turkey.' 1 The italics arc the author's throughout.Chapter 1.

If even then the question of the Sinai frontier created so much excitement, it may be inferred that England regards the possession of Egypt as a question of life and death, and that she is also most vulnerable there.'

' \ cry desirable will be the continuation of the railway not only to 2vlecca and Jedda, but as far as possible southwards to the Yemen—at first perhaps only with motors, whose wheels must be adapted to the sand of the desert. In this way connection should be sought towards the south with the railway which is planned in the Yemen, and about which we will speak again below. Not, however, to Aden but to Hodeida, or still better to Sheikh Said.' Trans-Araiuan Railway (pages 51 and 53). Lord Curzon is said to be perhaps the father of a scheme for a railway from Suez via Akaba straight across Arabia to Koweit. Lord Kitchener is said to have favoured a line from Port Sudan to either Koweit or the coast opposite Bahrein. Extract (page 53). ' Every ellort must be made to prevent England from attaining this object. Turkfey itself must with German help construct this or a similar railway from a point on the Hejaz railway to the Baghdad railway or to Koweit or Bahrein. In this way Turkish influence in Arabia would be fully secured, but above all England's position as a great Power would suffer, to the advantage oi 1 urkey and Germany. Her dangerous absolute control over the trade routes to the East would be interrupted. Such a railway is for a long time conceivable only as a strategical railway with military protection, but its importance is so great that it is worth considerable sacrifices. The preliminary conditions for it are that England should be deprived of her supremacy in the Persian Gulf also, and that other Powers, above all, I urkey, should have permanent influence there.' The University in Medina (pages 53 and 54). Extract (page 54). ' This foundation should be followed by similar foundations in Baghdad, Damascus, and the Yemen, which should not only disseminate purely Islamic knowledge, but strive to make western learning subserve their purposes. In this way it will be possible to form an educated element in the country from which efficient officials, doctors. Sic. can be recruited, and4 as soon as education has penetrated into these lands they will be able under the Turkish Crescent to form autonomous states, a confederation ol states, and so bring about a happy solution of the difficult Arabian question. A strong Turkey can afford to make concessions in the Arabian question.' Turkish Reforms, &amp;c. (pages 54 to GO). Extract (page 57). ' The pre-sapposition for an immediate general rising of Islam would have been the recognition of the Turkish khalifate by all orthodox Mohammedans and complete unity in Islam. But these are unattainable, if only because of the diversity of economic interests, which in many places are so closely bound up with those of the English, French, &amp;c. Thus the declaration of Holy war was indeed a very good weapon which in many places gave Turkey and us great assistance—1 need only mention German East Africa—but a universal rising of Islam must remain a Utopia. It can only take place after complete success in battle, which is alone decisive.' Chapter 7. ' Yemen and A sir ' (pages GO to 113). Railway from Hodeida to Sanaa (pages 100 to 104). Extract (page 103). After describing the Erench scheme for a railway from Hodeida to Sanaa, the writer continues :— ' The English have already begun preliminary works for a railway from Aden to Dala, which can easily be connected with the proposed southern portion of the railway from Hodeida to Sanaa Such a railway would not only divert all the trade of the Yemen to Aden, but. along with the continuation northwards to the llejaz railway, would have the greatest strategical importance, and inland connection from Egypt to Aden and a complete monopoly of the trade routes through the Rod Sea would be the consequence. It is impossible that a victorious Turkey should endure such a foreign body in its territory, and it is a vital interest for Turkey and the Central Powers that these English and Erench railway projects should never be carried out. Turkey must keep the supremacy over the ^ emeu, must maintain a strong garrison there and herself hnild the railway from Medina to the south of Arabia. When this is finished all disturbances will cease of themselves, and the railway affords the possibility of forwarding goods and troops to the shores of the Indian Ocean independently of the Suez Canal and of Egypt. And, therefore, the terminus must be, not at Aden or Hodeida, but only on the Indian Ocean in Turlfish territory, perhaps at Sheikh Said opposite the Island of Perim. On the conclusion of peace after the present war, the railway question including the Erench concessions in the Yemen must at all events be most seriously considered. I may perhaps take this opportunity to call attention to another very important question. In the mountains of the Yemen, whose highest point reaches 3,000 metres, there would be an excellent site for a great wireless station, which would stand in connection with Damascus or Constantinople, perhaps also with Nauen on the one side and the whole of the Indian Ocean on the other. Such a station in friendly Turkish territory under the protection of a strong r rurkey, and icorked by (German experts, would make the world independent of the cable monopoly of the English. Eor the English have made agree ments in perpetuity at all places from Egypt to the Indian Ocean, which are suited for the landing of cables. A wireless station in the Y r einen would annihilate the English cable monopoly with one blow. But the wireless station must be protected by the inland railway connection with Palestine, but even more by the strong garrison on the Yemen, and by the construction of Turkish fortifications at Sheikh Said.'Extract (page 112). ' The victorious Turks must make every rliort to restore the Yemen to the prosperity upon which, owing to its nature, it can reckon. How internal policy is to be conducted in this country cannot be decided without personal investigation ; but the history of the whole of Turkish admini stration has always taught us that in the Yemen ouhi the best officials are qood ennurjh, and that the Turks must not shrink from investing capital in the land for reconstruction. The creation of communications and a sound revenue and fiscal si/stem will be necessary. It will also be inevitable that the Turks here should abandon their centraLising methods, and build up an Arabian administration and an Arabian judicial system, by draicing in the inhabitants of the country .... As regards external policy we Germans have the greatest interest in seeing that a victorious and strong Turkey keeps the country, and builds there, with our help, and without the Knglish and French, a railway and a largi'. wireless station. We must also hope that peace will give us an opportunity of readjusting the frontier with the Knglish sphere of interest, in ichich the most, important point will be that Turkey should secure the peninsula of Sheikh Said with a sufficient zone for its protection.' ChapterS. 'Sheikh Said, and the French claims thereto ' (pages 113 to 120). In 1734 Admiral La Bourdonnais obtained a cession of the Cape from the native Sultan. Louis XVL is even said to have kept an agent there. Napoleon Bonaparte instructed General Bon to occupy the place, but nothing was done. In 1828 Mehemed Ali was instructed by the French Government to occupy it. When he wished to do so 10 years later the French Govern ment no longer supported him, for England opposed this expedition. When England in 1839 had occupied Aden and in 1857 Perim, her interest in Sheikh Said was perhaps lost. At all events she allowed the district to be sold to a French Company in 18G8, and the contract was registered by the French Consulate in Aden on the 14th October 1808. England tried to upset the purchase and caused the Governor of the Hejaz to protest on the ground that Sheikh Said belonged to Turkey. The French ^Ministry of Perim sent Lieutenant Vidal to the spot, who established the validity of the contract, which was confirmed on the 21st December 1809, the period for payment being prolonged to the 1st December 1870. Payments were made regularly. The Societe de Babel-Mandeb (founded by MM. Rabaud Bazin, of Marseilles) sent a Comite d'etndes to Arabia. On the 4tli June 1870 the Governor of Mocha occupied Sheikh Said, and the French Consul at Aden protested. After negotiations in Paris and Constantinople the Turks admitted the regularity of the purchase, but as the Governor of Mocha did not withdraw, the Company stopped its payments to the Sheikh and interrupted its work. In 1871 Rear-Admiral Lallemand deposited oil, and probably also coal, at Sheikh Said. In 1870 Monsieur Suel tried to sell the district to the French Government, but consideration of the proposal was deferred. In 1884 the Italian Government approached the Marseilles Com pany with a view to sale. Two million francs were asked. It was said that Germany, Russia, England, and Spain were interested, but that the others went no further in the matter for fear of annoying England. In 1885 the French traveller Soleillet wrote 'one of the keys of the Red Sea is in our hands. Shall we abandon it ? By occupying Sheikh Said we can keep the Suez Canal open.' On the 7th December 1890, Deloncle maintained French rights at Sheikh Said in the French Chamber. It is said that in 1898 France bought the district from the Company and declared it a French colony. Nevertheless, the Turkish Government sent troops there on the 19th October 1902. A new attack was begun by French interests in 1901. M. Presseq- Rolland, afterwards editor of the Depeche de Toulouse, concluded a new- contract with the son of the Sultan, Mohamed Ali Tabat Durein, who had died in the meantime ; but the purchase was disallowed by his Government. During the war between Italy and Turkey the Turkish garrison was increased to 4,000. At the end of 1913 French interests made another attempt. M. Albert Corbie, who has written a book on the subject, and who was s 329clearly the head of the Cabinet d'Etudes techniques des houilleres et du port 'le C heikh Said, visited Djibouti in October. Apparently he received no encouragement from the Governor of Djibouti or the French Vice-Consul at Aden ; and when it proved impossible to go to Sheikh Said owing to the presence oE the Turkish garrison, he was obliged to return to France. Extract (page 120). ' It is very important at the conclusion of a peace favourable to Turkey to examine the question of Sheikh Said closely, and if possible to secure that the frontier with English territory is carried at some distance from the Cape and not in accordance with the demarcation of 1905. It will be for consideration later, after careful military and technical study, whether not only strong Turkish fortifications but also harbour works can be constructed there, and whether it is possible to bring a railway from the north there. At all events Sheikh Said is for the Red Sea an extraordinarily important place.' Chapter 9. ' The English Possessions and Spheres of Interest in South Arabia ' (pages 120 to J 50). Chapter 10. 'Muscat or Oman ' (pages 151 to 19-1). Extract (page 191). ' But it is not only the arms traffic that is in question. Muscat has a very good harbour protected by an island which affords a first-class base where coal depots and fortifications can be erected now that 1 ranee no longer affords resistance ; and the harbour of Muscat means for the Persian Gulf what Aden is to the Red Sea, namely, a strategical key of this sea, which the English now treat as their own. Apart from the question of its terminus at Koweit our Bagdad railway has access only to an English lake so long as the exit from the Persian Gulf is exclusively in English hands. And that is now the case ; for on the Persian side also the English possess the cable station at Jask, Basidu on the island of Kishm, and the little islands of Tamb and z \bu Musa off the Strait of Hormuz. Lastly they have full control over the pirate coast. Even if the war ends favourably, formal assurances on the part of England will not avail us to secure the freedom of the sea there, and to protect the Baghdad Railway from being throttled at the suitable moment. The only remedy is that the English should be compelled to abandon their exclusive claims in the Persian Gulf, and to allow some other Power which does not belong to the Entente to secure a firm point there. For this purpose the huge sheltered bay at CapeMusandim (in which the whole English fleet could find anchorage) would be very suitable, if the climate were not so unendurably hot that the English themselves had to give up the place, which they occupied from 18G4 to 1869 when they wished to erect a cable station there. But it will be difficult to get England out of Muscat, to which she attaches the greatest importance .... ' But the freedom of the Persian Gulf is for our Baghdad Railway a vital question, and there, as in the Red Sea, we cannot, or can only with great difficulty, reach open waters. Therefore something must happen which will secure freedom for us and other Powers.' 1 Chapter 11, ' Bahrein and the Turkish Province of El-Hasa :&gt; (paees 195 to 205). Chapter 12. ' The Wahabis and their successors in Xejd ' (pages 200 to 217). Page 212. Captain Shakespear's visit to Bin Sand in April 1913 is mentioned, and it is suggested that he arranged for the ejection of the Turks from El-Hasa. 1 See Appendix.Page 213. It is stated that at the beginning of 1914 the French sent a representative to Bin Sand who offered him a sum of 100,0002, or 50,000?. and cheap consignments of arms. When England hoard of this she offered him a yearly payment of 50,0002. and all the arms lie might require. Extract (page 217). ' It is hardly possible to draw a horoscope for future policy in Central Arabia. Hitherto the Turks have had little satisfaction out of the Province of El-lfasa. It will be difficult for them at the end of a successful war to open good relations with the family of Bin Sand who have clearly attached themselves to England, and who with England's help deprived them of the Provinces of El-Hasa. Probably the policy will be to strengthen the family of Bin Rashid as much as possible, to help them to become the leading power, and to set up an administration suitable to the disturbed conditions of Arabia Then it may perhaps be possible to make out of these regions a kind of confederation for Turkey. But real influence and security will only be attained there when a railway crosses the land from a point on the Hejaz railway, and runs perhaps to Basra or Bahrein. Then, if the idio syncrasies of the Arabs are spared, it will be possible to create a dam against the turbulent Bedouin, and to protect all northern Arabia.' Chapter 13. ' Irak' (pages 217 to 25!).

' Many politicians believe that it is not yet certainly established whether it will be economically an advantage for the Baghdad railway to be continued beyond Baghdad, because then trade would choose the shorter line to the sea and not the longer one northwards. I think that the present war has taught everyone ol us that England is capable of anything, and that it is not tolerable for us that the great work of the Baghdad railway should be cut off from the sea if economic conditions require its prolongation to it.' Extract (page 231). ' The management of the port and the control of navigation from Basra to the sea is also claimed by England, who in this way can completely throttle our Baghdad railway at its Gulf end. It is essential that the port of Basra, the fairway of the Shatt-el-Arab, and the territory of Koweit should remain lurkish, in order that this Power may undertake there what she thinks lit in the interest of the country. But we must insist upon this because we are laying out great sums on the railway which we do not wish to be dependent on England's favour.' I he oil deposits of Mohammerah,' &amp;c.

' The outbreak of the complication with Turkey on the 29th October was a very welcome opportunity to India to carry out her long cherished purposes. One of the most important glacis for India, namely, the Persian Gulf, was considered to be threatened by the German railway schemes. The opportunity was given to destroy these German enterprises even though they were commercial. A success here would greatly strengthen Englishinfluenco in Arabia wliicli England had so long striven to obtain in under hand ways, and would make it possible to set up an Arabian Khalifate against the Turkish. By detaching the Arabs from Turkey, Turkey would be most seriously weakened, and would no longer be the leading Islamic Power, while England would then bring the remaining Islamic states under her power, thus strengthening her position in India. Lastly, it was obviously desired by the attack on Mesopotamia to divert the Turkish offensive from Egypt.' Chapter 14. 'Conclusion ' (pages '2u2 to 201). ' At the outbreak of the present war from which the world will probably emerge newly distributed, conditions in Arabia were, as we have shown, routfhlv as follows : — ' Turkey had possessed the province of Hejaz, with the Holy Places, since the 14:th century, and the Yemen since 1871, having concluded peace in the latter country with the Imam Yahya. In Asir her power is very precarious, since there the Idrisi, who is supported by England, France, and ltal\ r , is opposed to her. In the east Turkey was driven out of the province of El-Hasa in the middle of 1913 by the Wahabi Chief, Bin Sand, with English help, but has retained her nominal sovereignty by nominating him Governor. From Koweit she has had to withdraw before the English. Since 1839 the English have possessed Aden, Perim, and the Khuria-Muria islands ; they have concluded protectorate treaties with the south Arabian chiefs from Babel-Mandeb to Mirbat, without exercising sovereignty there. In Oman the English are actually, if not in form, the rulers. By means of money and gifts of arms they control Central Arabia, through Bin Saud, the Sheikh of Koweit, and the Idrisi of Asir. On the Trucial coast their treaties have driven them great influence, if not protectorate ; there the Wahabis under Bin Saud have also come down to the sea. Bahrein is not an English possession, but is entirely under English influence. ' The Imam Yahya adheres to the Turks, and many of the chiefs of the British protectorate in southern Arabia will follow suit after a military success. In the north Bin Rashid of Hail is loyal to the Turks, as are apparently many of the tribes of the borders of Irak. Connection with the tribes friendly to the Turks can be secured partly by the Hejaz railway and partly on the caravan routes through Arabia, but communications will be very difficult for reinforcements. ' The English on the other hand have the water always open, and will use their linancial means to obtain assistance. The rolling English sovereign, 1 the light cavalry of St. George,' as it has been humourously called, plays an important part. ' Arabia, it is true, can only be a subsidiary theatre of war, the decisions will be arrived at elsewhere. But nevertheless Arabia is of the greatest importance for the war, and essential for the objects of the war, for it lies between the two great sea routes to the East. To liberate these Arabia can and must assist.' Extract (page 255). ' We saw from the history of the lighting in the Yemen how difficult it is, in the religious, political and geographical conditions, even for an Islamic Power to get a firm footing there, lor a Christian Power it would be almost impossible. But a strong Turkey will probably be able to do so, if she skilfully takes into account the local conditions and treats this land only as a well-administered federal state, without wishing to make the inhabitants national Turks. We saw also that a strong Turkey is the only Power that can oppose England's efforts after a monopoly in the Red Sea, and is in a position to prevent one of the most important sea routes from being dominated by a single Power. The continuance of Turkey in the Yemen, the land connection of the Yemen with the north by the prolongation of the Hejaz railway, and the erection of a great wireless station in the Yemen ; lastly, if possible, also the construction of a harbour in Turkish territory at4 9 the exit of the Red Sea—these are the wishes which not only Germany must cherish for the future, but also all who see in the freedom of the sea routes the means of securing the legitimate competition of the nations, and who do not wish the Ked Sea to be an English lake.' After a description of the political situation in the Persian Gulf at the beginning of the war, with quotations from Lord Curzon (Persia 11. 403), Admiral Mahan, and the 'Times' History of the War, illustrating the political and strategical importance of the Gulf for India, the writer proceeds: — Extract (page 259). ' From all this we see that England is not only vulnerable in the Channel and Egypt, but that in the Persian Gulf she is at least as sensitive as in these nearer regions. Indeed, we must assume that a set-back in the Persian Gulf would have the worst possible effect on feeling in India. But if as a conse quence of the war England were compelled to allow access to the Gulf to any other nation, even if it were Russia, this fact would be regarded by her as a very serious defeat in her most sensitive spot. ' For Germany it is not necessary, and not even desirable, to have a point in the Persian Gulf under her own administration, unless it be a question of necessary naval bases. It is sufficient for us if any other nation besides England has free passage into and out of the Gulf. In other words, what we have to aim at is that Turkey should recover free control over the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab, and that any other nation, which is not quite weak and has not been entirely taken in tow by England, should obtain a strong post at the exit of the Gulf, whether in Oman or on the Persian side. If this cannot be attained, the Baghdad railway will be limited to local traffic in ' Asiatic Turkey, or will be compelled to-seek an exit on the open ocean in Arabia or in Persia, i.e., by connection with the Hejaz railway or by a branch perhaps to Bunder Abbas. But we must not allow our consideration to be « guided entirely by regard for the Baghdad railway, although that is important enough, as a great economic undertaking, for the consolidation of a friendly Turkey. The 'dry' path from Hamburg to Baghdad is not enough for us. Germany, and especially Hamburg, needs a'so the 'wet' paths ; in this case the sea route from Basrah to the Indian Ocean, where England c'aims the sole supremacy. The battles which are being fought in Mesopotamia between the English invading army and the Turks are of quite essential significance for the result of the world war. Indeed, they may be decisive in respect of England. ' The influence which England has for a long time been seeking quite unobtrusively in Arabia itself, and the object of which is to shatter and eliminate the authority of Turkey, must have a very unfortunate effect on Turkey, for whom not only are the Arabian provinces important parts of the Turkish State, but the control of the Holy Places is synonymous with the i possession of the Khalifate. But for England's interests in Egypt and India it must be important to have an Islamic Khalifate entirely under English influence. The power which England is exercising in Central Arabia over the regions ruled by Bin Sand is a permanent threat to Turkey. We must, therefore, strive to ensure that a strong Turkey emerges from the war. ' ' For a long time past all the threads cf Arabian intrigues have ended in London ' wrote, in 1013, the Frenchmen St. Brice. And the great im portance of Arabia for English policy lies in the fact that Great Britain not only wishes to damage Turkey in order to strengthen her own position in Egypt and India ; she also wishes to maintain complete control over the sea routes leading to the East. She does not wish, like the Romans and the Khalifs by their customs posts, to monopolise trade and dictate prices commercially; but she claims political predominance, to the exclusion of all other Powers, in the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf, in order to be in a position to block them at her good pleasure. The motives for the control of the chief sea routes have somewhat altered since ancient times, but the fact remains, and it is equally dangerous for all seafaring and commercial nations. s 329 c' T//c freedom oj the seas for which ice to-day are striving in the war signifies their liberation from English supremacy. Some of the means by which this is to be attained in the Wed Sea and Persian Gulf I have shown in the course of our investigation. But how far these objects can be secured depends on the success of the sword, and on the general political situation which it is not yet possible to control. ' In India lies the centre of gravity of English policy and Arabia is the immediate glacis of India! ' Thus we see that for the conduct of the war and for the foreign policy of ihe Central Powers, and especially of Turkey, Arabia plays a very important part. But for our Allies, the Turks, there also lie in Arabia the most serious problems of internal policy. The old antagonism between the Turkish and Arabian portions of the Empire, which has always been artfully fostered by France and England, has to-day, under the compulsion of the war, been somewhat obliterated, but not reconciled. After peace, along with the reform of the administration and especially of the systems of iinance and taxation, Turkey's most important task will be to find the right way of reconciling Turkish-Arabian antagonism. If this is not done, after the establishment of external tranquillity, internal passions will again flame up, and will give England, France and Russia a welcome excuse to interfere and win influence. A reconciliation seems only possible by the continuation of the reforms begun in the Yemen, and by the grant of a great measure of independence to the Arabian regions under Turkish suzerainty. Precedents for such reforms Turkey may find in her present Allies, Germany and Austria-Hungary. It is to be hoped that far-sighted and patriotic men will be found who will know how to solve those internal problems, which perhaps are more difficult than the military problems of the war. But Turkey, emerging (as may be hoped) from the present struggle strong and vigorous, can afford to make concessions in the interior, and thereby find tranquillity for her prosperous development.'

Germany is primarily interested in Mesopotamia, and 'must exert every :i effort during and after the war (I) if the Baghdad Railway is not to be left ' a torso, its access to the Gulf blocked, and our firms there left to decay ; ' (2) if we want to help Turkey to a renaissance in the south-east also, so ' that the development of Mesopotamia shall fall to her and not to England; ' (3) if, from the military point of view, we wish to prevent the Persian ' Gulf becoming a second Red Sea under British control, the Strait of ' Hormuz becoming a second Straits of Dover or Gibraltar, or Malta, or ' Perim-Aden, thus permitting this south-eastern exit into the Indian Ocean— ' very important in war—to be permanently blocked by British guns.' The writer then reviews existing political and commercial conditions in the Gulf. In the former respect, the Gulf is now a British mare clansum. Jn the latter. Germany had won a respectable position before the war, especially in cotton goods: on the other hand England has the oil monopoly, and the transaction with the Anglo-Persian Company is compared with the purchase of the Suez Canal shares. After enlarging on the future prospects, he says that more important even than these is the geographical position of the Gulf for commercial purposes. This alone, with its military consequences, suffices to set before the Central Powers a goal the attainment of which is necessanj [sic], and must be secured in the present war. He compares the Gulf with the Adriatic, and Germany has the same interest in the ' freedom ' of both. The Baghdad Railway is discussed, and lie points out that it will not carry through goods traffic. We are not so foolish as to think that. In the immediate future its economic importance will be mainly in developing the country through which it passes. Put it will also carry mails and passengers, and shorten the journey to India by two or three days. Last, but not least, military considerations. The role played by the Siberian Railway in carrying munitions during the present war is an example. In the next war with Great Britain we shall have armoured cruisers ready for action in the harbours of East Africa, and our communications with that Colony need not be interrupted so long as the Strait of Hormuz is open and not fortified by England like the Straits of Gibraltar. As the Baghdad Railway itself cannot be threatened, all we have to do—and it will not be easy, though it will be worth while—is to see that its cultural work is not blocked by the closing of the exit to the sea. A true instinct, as well as rational ' deliberation, has led us to the indispensable requirement of the freedom of *' the sea in the Persian Gulf also.' Otherwise we shall permanently lose our share in the development of Mesopotamia, Persia and Arabia; the Baghdad Railway will end in a cul-de-sac; and important military possi bilities will be lost. From this point of view it is immaterial whether the line ends at Koweit or Basra. We must get rid of England's privileged position at Koweit because it secures her supremacy in the whole north western corner of the Gulf. But for all immediate practical purposes a terminus at Basra suffices. England will oppose this policy bitterly. ' She ' regards Mesopotamia as the glacis of India, and wishes to unite a British ' Egypt across Arabia with British India, thus setting up an enormous ' bulwark east and west; just as in Africa she is striving after a purely ' British sphere from Cairo to Cape Town. If she succeeds in permanently ' securing in lower Egypt on the Suez Canal the full supremacy which she ' is now exercising in war, the prospects of the Central Powers are not good ' in lower Mesopotamia either. In spite of the many great drawbacks, ' losses, &amp;c., which the war will have entailed, England will emerge from it ' with a quite enormous profit if her spheres of activity on the Suez Canal 'and in the Persian Gulf are not disturbed. We earnestly hope that the ' military power of the Turks will also succeed in driving the English out of ' Basra at last, and over the waters of the Persian Gulf.
