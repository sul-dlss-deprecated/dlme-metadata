Indeed, the Baghdad railway will be built and carried through Persia and Afgiianictan to India, however not by *©rmans but by the British* This turn in the Baghdad railway question occurrod already before the daiser went to Ilngland and !ii-s visit meant the final settling of the new agreement.

On the other hand Turkey ceemed much more friendly to uc but it was just this plan of the Baghdad railway which rendered all Orientals suspicious of Germany, especially when the fanciful dreams of the Pan-aehaano settled Asia Minor and Mesopotamia with leutonic colonlotc. Besides turkey, for ever struggling with monetary difficulties, was to bear the coots of the enterprise and the German company were only to lend the fund© required for th© construction of the railway. Again the Ottoman Government, in the chap© of a considerable financial guarantee for each completed mile of the line (^hilomotert;arantie* ), was expected to pay a high rat© of interest for the loan in addition to a snug commission to the contractors. It was therefore th© German Ambassador's duty to soo that the Turkish Revenue should yield more satisfactory results than hitherto so that the funds necessary for the guarantee should be forthcoming* However^ the Turks did not enter into th© spirit of this friendly service and it was easy for Great Britain to more mid more weaken German influence on the Bosphorus. The 'pacific conquest' of great countries is not such on easy matter* The Russians wore not able to obtainobtain a guarantee for the repayment of the fabuloue suras filing in the Landchurian railway, ihey had to fortify tlie terminus of the line. Port Arthur, at great expense; they had to guard the line by an army of 160,000 men and wore yet drawn into the disastrous war with Japan, this is a lesson to bo profited by and we may calculate what the Baghdad railway would have yielded to us if we had really built it and had been ready to maintain it as a Goman * enterprise. Therefor© the last thing which we could do in Iho matter was to bow before Great Britain. Nevertheless wo would prefer if our politicians did not launch such wild scheiaes of world^policy which we cannot carry out add which only create us enemies. Such schemes are especially nonsensical if within the Empire the strength of the nation is intentionally weakened by Ignoring ('Ausschaltung* ) the wishes of the Catholic minority, thus offering to foreign countries the spectacle of internal strife.

At tliz two former places, Ed A Covemnsnt can clai a no te r ' r 'i tori al rights on behalf of the Sheikh of Koiceit, and the creation of a terminus there could only be opposed on diplomatic grounds of general policy. As regards Barba roads, which next to Kowett seems the most suitable terminus, it would undoubtedly re desirable to as -rt any rights which the EheVtSh of K owe it may possess, though the position would not be fully secured unless those rights covered not only the island of Barba but the coast of the mainland between Um Kasr cqu.

Grey. Foreign Office, Sir &gt; October 2, 1907. WE have carefully considered, in accordance with your instructions, the various ports on the Persian Gulf, not in Persian territory, which would be suitable for the terminus of the Bagdad Bailway. They are three in number, namely, Bunder Shweikh (near Koweit), TVarba Boads, including Um Kasr, and Bussorah. Bunder Shweikh. TV e are unanimously of opinion that, from topographical and hydrographical considerations, Bunder Shweikh, which occupies a position south-west of Koweit, would undoubtedly be the best site, since— (a.) A wharf about 1 mile in length, or a series of smaller wharves of that length, could be constructed, with depths of not less than 25 feet alongside at low water. (b.) A judicious arrangement of beacons would enable a vessel to use a channel to this wharf of a depth of not less than 14 feet of water at low-water springs, of 21 feet at high-water neaps, and 24 feet at high-water springs. (c.) It would not he difficult to increase the depth of this channel to 20 feet at low-water springs, or 27 feet at high-water neaps, and 30 feet at high-water springs, and it is possible that even greater depth could be obtained at some cost. (d.) The berths alongside the wharf would be perfectly secure at all times, and would be open to the breeze, which would prevent the stifling heat so prevalent at times on the littoral of the Persian Gulf. (e.) A railway could be constructed to run down to the wharf, and passengers or goods be embarked or disembarked without delay. The above advantages are important, as the whole tendency of traffic in the present day is to bring vessels to wharves or into floating docks, with railway com munication alongside, so that transhipment to small vessels, lighters, or boats, is avoided. The question of the expense of fitting a terminal port for traffic is small in comparison with the expense of a railway, and the advantage of a railway is greatly reduced if a convenient terminal port cannot be constructed. Such a convenient terminal port could be made at Bunder Shweikh at probably very much less cost than at any other place. Worba Roads, including Um Kasr. JSText in order of convenience, Warba Boadstead has most advantages; but, owing to the longer distance from the open sea and to the necessity of buoying and lighting the channel, the facilities are not so great as at Bunder Shweikh. Moreover, the Island of Warba and the adjacent coast near Um Kasr is for a large portion of the year practically uninhabited. In these circumstances, it would be difficult to insure protection against Arab raids—a danger which would not exist at Koweit, where the conditions for defence against land attacks are more favourable. [8fi7] BUm Kasr, a small creek on the Khor Zobeir, might possibly be made useful as a terminus, either in itself or in conjunction with Warba Roads. It is somewhat more inaccessible than Warba Roads, and the facilities for constructing a wharf aie limited, since at most the accommodation would only suffice for berthing thiee vessels at a time, as against six at Bunder Shweikh. Bussorah. We consider that, despite its commercial importance, the promoters of the railway will not adopt Bussorah as a terminus, except in the last resort, because the cost of maintaining a sufficient deptli to enable ocean-going steamers to cross the bar of the Shatt-el-Arab (which is 10 miles in length) at all times of tide, would undoubtedly be considerable. It would be possible to avoid this difficulty by cutting a ship canal from the vicinity of Bussorah to the Khor Zobeir (a continuation of the Khor Um Kasr and the Khor Abdulla); but the time occupied in navigating the canal, and then the channel to the open sea, would be a drawback, in so far as passenger traffic and the carriage of mails are concerned. Two other places have been suggested as possible terminal ports, namely, Fao and Ras Kathama, at the head of Koweit Bay. Fuo. Except for greater proximity to the sea, Eao, which lies inside the bar of the Shatt-el-Arab, has all the disadvantages and none of the commercial advantages of Bussorah. Ras Kathama. The depth of 20 feet at low water is about f mile or upwards from the shore. It would therefore be necessary to run out a pier at considerable expense. The construction of wharves would be much more costly than at Bunder Shweikh. Under these circumstances we strongly recommend that the strip of foreshore at Bunder Shweikh should be acquired as proposed, since (a) it would undoubtedly be an asset in negotiations for British participation in the railway | and (/&gt;) even if these negotiations were to prove abortive, it would be expedient to consolidate our position at Koweit, in order to counterbalance the prejudicial effects of any German port which may possibly be constructed in the neighbourhood at some future time. But, while we hold that the leasing of land at Bunder Shweikh is a step in the right direction, we do not consider that the possession of this harbour alone by Great Britain would exclude the Germans from access to the Persian Gulf. It would no doubt render our co-operation in the railway more desirable, but it would not make it indispensable. . The } P osition this country would indeed be incalculably stronger if His Majesty’s Government were to secure rights of pre-emption or priority of lease in regard to Warba Island and Bubiyan Island, since both command the approaches to the Khcr Abdulla and Khor Um Kasr, as also the commodious anchora° , e on the south of Warba Island. We entirely concur in the view expressed by the Govern ment of India in their letter of the 4th February, 1904, namely, that- “ the sh ° res ° f the mai “ land and of Bubiyan Island in the possession of a eiu K l, Power, the anchorages below Um Kasr and at Warba Island can at any time be converted ifb3 an impregnable harbour, and even if the day is still distant when the banks of the Khor Abdulla are likely to be armed with foreign forts or batteries, the undivided occupation by a German Railway Company of a potentially invulnerable position is not calculated to conduce to the enhancement either of British commercial prosperity or of British political prestige.” We therefore recommend, if^diplomatic considerations permit, that the Sheikh of Koweit should be invited to specify the nature of his claims to Warba Island, to which he is understood frequently to have referred; and that the continued occupation of Bubiyan Island by a Turkish post, in derogation of the Sheikh’s territorial claims (which have been recognized and supported by His Majesty’s Government), should be neutralized by the establishment forthwith of a Koweiti post, with the countenance of His Majesty’s Government, on Warba Island, or, if that should prove undesirable, on the northern shore of Bnbiyan Island. If practicable, we would even recommend the establishment of posts on both islands. We desire to emphasize the importance which we attach to the effective assertion of the Sheikh’s territorial claims to Bubiyan. We wish to record our conviction that, once the railway has been constructed, the economic penetration under German influence will he so formidable as in the course of time seriously to undermine our position—political, commercial, and strategic—in the Persian Gulf. The recent institution of a line of subsidized steam ships plying between Hamburg and the Gulf already marks the interest of Germany in those regions. We would therefore venture to express the conclusion that every effort, should be made to insure a fair measure of British control over the terminus of the Bagdad Bailway. We do not, however, feel confident that we possess the means absolutely to debar Germany from acquiring an outlet on the Gulf; and this outlet, though at first commercial, might eventually be transformed into a strategic base, but by steps so gradual and clandestine as to render protests difficult or impracticable. In these \ circumstances we cannot but express the opinion that it is in the highest degree desirable to come to terms with the promoters of the Bail way. Pinally, we would advocate that all s*eps which His Majesty’s Government may consider feasible should be taken to consolidate the advantages we already possess at the entrance to the Persian Gulf, notably at Musandim Peninsula (where the harbour accommodation and water supply are adequate) and at the Islands of Kishm and Henjam.

(Signed) ’ N. R. O’CONOR. [Inclosure 1. Colonel Surtees to Sir N. O'Conor. (No. 17.) Sir, Constantinople, September 21, 1907.

Memorandum respecting British occupation of certain Localities situated at the head of the Persian Gulf in connection with the projected Terminus of the Bagdad Railway by Colonel Surtees, Military Attache', Constantinople. HIS Majesty’s Government is negotiating for the acquisition of foreshore at Koweit with a view to its possible utilization as the terminus of the Bagdad Railway. Should Koweit become the terminus, we should have an indefeasible claim to participation in arrangements relative to the control of the Bagdad Railway. But there are other points possibly suitable for termini, such as Um Kasr and Sabiyah, and it is not probable that the Germans have overlooked the suitability of the Khor-Abdulla and the Khor Zobeir for wharfage in connection with a terminus. In any case, it is abundantly clear that the Turks are fully alive to the importance of Um Kasr with reference to the last-mentioned waterway. Were we in possession of Bubiyan Island as well as of a position on Warba Island it would be possible to close the Khor-es-Sobieh (if it be not already closed by silting), and the Khor-Abdulla be rendered unapproachable to an enemy from the side ot Eao. The claims of the Sheikh of Koweit to Bubiyan Island would only be strengthened by such a desirable occupation. Should such an occupation meet with no serious opposition on the part of the Turks, there would, I venture to submit, be no reason to suppose that a claim to an advanced position on Warba Island, established possibly on a slight extension of the Sheikh’s fishing claims on Bubiyan Island, would encounter any greater resistance. ^ The holding of points on Bubian and Warba Islands appears to be of decisive importance. By such an occupation, involving entire command of the waterways, the establish ment of a terminus on the west coast of the head of the Gulf north of Koweit would be entirely impossible without the consent and concurrence of Great Britain. It is understood that careful and minute surveys of these localities have beencarried out within the past year by the Indian Marine, and I do not therefore propose entering into a further reiterative description of the places than I lave one m Appendix to this Memorandum. c1 - rTT&gt; r T rm 7 a (Signed) H. CONYERS SURTEES, Colonel, General Staff. Constantinople, September 21, 1907. / APPENDIX. Khor-Abdulla is an inlet between Bubiyan Island and the mainland west of the Shatt-el-Arab. It is 14 miles wide at the entrance between Ras-el-Beit (Bubiyan Island) and the promontory south of Fao. There are deep water channels leading from it to Khor Um Kasr and the adjacent waterways. The Concessions now being asked for from the Sheikh do not close this khor to foreign enterprise. Sabiyah is occupied by the Sheikh’s men. *Um Kassr and the surrounding country are claimed by the Sheikh of Koweit, and in February 1902 there was stated to be a camp of Koweit tribesmen, 2^ miles from the Turkish camp. There is apparently no town, but the site of Um Kasr is marked by an inclosure occupied by some thirty Turkish soldiers. It is situated some 4 miles up the Khor Um Kasr on its west shore, and is 38 miles from Bussorah. It was stated by Mr. Wratislaw in 1902 to be most important, and even better adapted for a railway terminus than is Koweit, but he considered the Sheikh’s claims to be very shadowy, even, though the Turks seemed to have no better title than that of recent occupation. Bubiyan Island, south-west of the Khor-Abdulla, is 25 miles long (north and south) by 12 miles broad. y J Early in 1902 a Turkish post was established on the east coast of the island, and in February of the same year one officer and twenty soldiers detached from the Um Kasr garrison were in camp there, but during the summer the detachment was reduced to ten soldiers. It is claimed by the Sheikh of Koweit, but has no permanent population and no supplies it is used regularly as a fishing station for some months annually by the Sheikh’s Arabs’ and by no others. Mr Wratislaw considered the claim to_ be good, as also did Colonel KembalL and instructions 1110 8 ^ m f ,a8Sa dor at Constantinople advanced the same, acting under WarbaMand,! miles long roughly, north-east and south-west.

To His Excellency the Right Honourable the Governor General of India in Council. My Lord, With reference to my telegram of the 30th December last, I ■Persian Gulf: question of IT? j° - vour Excellency hoisting the British Flag at Cape 1 iat tlle of hoisting the Musandim, $c. ' British flag at Cape Musandim has . , . been fulI 7 considered in all its bearings by His Majesty’s Government. 2. The object which the Government of India desire to attain as stated in their Secret letters in the Foreign Department of the 23rd October 1902, No. 192, and the 21st January 1904. No. 16, is to prevent any Foreign Power establishing a commanding position at the entrance of the Peisian Gulf. His Majesty’s Government are in entire agree ment with yom Excellency as to the necessity of preventing any such action on the part of a Foreign Power, the first result of which would he to entail an increase of naval expenditure and a re-arrangement of our naval dispositions. It only remains, therefore, to consider the best means of securing this object. ^ 3. The method which the Government of India have desired to adopt, viz., to hoist the British flag at certain points in the immediate vicinity of Cape Musandim, is open to the objection that it would not confer upon us any special rights in the places selected, unless it were accom panied by a specific proclamation of protectorate or annexation. On the other hand, an open assertion of our claims to these places might excite the jealousy of other Powers, and give rise to political complications. 4. The alternative method would be to make it clear that His Majesty’s Government would not tolerate the occupation by any Foreign Power of any port or territory in the Persian Gulf. It will he within your Excellency’s recollection that on the 5th May 1903 Lord Lansdowne stated in the House of Lords that “ we should regard the &lt;e establishment of a naval base or of a fortified port in the Persian “ Gulf by any other Power as a very great menace to British interests, “ and we should certainly resist it with all the means at our disposal.” 5. 6.I To this declaration His Majesty's Government adhere, and it is their intention to rely upon it for the protection of their interests. 5. These considerations have led His Majesty s Government, as I stated in my telegram of the 31st March last, to modify the oraers contained in my telegram of the 4th August 1904. they arrived at the conclusion that the flagstafTs on Sheep Island and the isthmus between Malcolm and Elphinstone inlets should be abandoned, and that it would be sufficient for the purposes of the policy laid down in the preceding paragraph to maintain the flagstaff upon Telegraph Island as a sign of the continuance of our occupation of that spot which first took place in connection with the operations of the Eastern Telegraph Company in 1869. 6. The opinion of His Majesty’s Gavernment with regard to the flagstaff on Telegraph Island was based on the conclusion, formulated in the Secret Letter from your Excellency’s Government, No. 192, of the 23rd October 1902, that the jurisdiction of the Sultan of Muscat over the Makhlab Isthmus and Musandim Promontory was of so uncertain and ineffective a character that it would be open to His Majesty’s Government to ignore it. 7. The position has, however, been materially altered by Mr. Lorimer’s enquiries, the result of which is reported in his note of the 22nd March last; and I gather from your Excellency’s telegrams of the 27th March and 15th April last that the Government of India are no longer prepared to ignore the fact of the Sultan’s sovereignty over Musandim. 8. In the changed circumstances, having regard to the considerations stated above (paragraph 3), and in view of the grounds upon which Her late Majesty’s Government protested to the Erench Government against the cession to them by the * Lord Salisbury to Sir E. Monson, ]STos. 48 and 58, dated loth and 22nd February 1899. (Copy to India with Poli tical Secretary’s letter No. 9, dated 3rd March 1899). Sultan of Bunder Gisseh in 1898,* I request that your Excellency’s Government will again take into your consideration the question of the maintenance of the flagstaff on Telegraph Island, in the light of the further information now in your possession, and inform me of your views. In the meantime nothing should be done in anticipation of the final decision of His Majesty’s Government. I have the honour to be, My Lord, Your Lordship’s most obedient humble Servant.

With reference to telegram No. 28, dated 3rd September 1' 07 T hov„ the honour to report that your message was delivered to Sheikh Mubarak who 32 $ K^lSiS-r ,ui “ “• “-r desired WHnfomftiontgartog pmsenfcustoms rate. ^Phe s“ plmted to let me know what rate he would decide to levy, before he left as he proposes to do during the week, for the Shatt-ul-Arab. He promised ’in this connection to bear in mind the axiom that it was better, in his own ntcres s to Rvy light duties on a number of packages than to take heavy rates on a 4. I carefully avoided any mention of controversial matters, such as the arms trade, and think that there is nothing that it is more important to avoid all mention of; Sheikh Mubarak would take refuge in an indignant denial that arms were imported and nothing but bitterness would be introduced by even the slightest hint in that direction. ^ 5. As regards telegram No. 29, dated the 3rd September 1907, I venture to hope that it will not be difficult to introduce the condition that the Sheikh should be guided to a reasonable extent by the friendly advice of the British Government or their representative. But I also think that it would be possible to conclude a customs regulation in the following way. We would first settle the terms of the lease and the acceptance, introducing the general principle o£ customs regulation, already quoted in my previous despatches and refer ring for further information to a customs regulation to be signed by Sheikh Mubarak, on the part of himself and his heirs, and by myself on behalf of the British Government. Such signature should precede the signature of the lease and acceptance. 6. While on this matter of the customs regulation I would say that I have made detailed enquiries in the matter of the levy of customs at present rates. ^ The rates are not in any way uniform and some questions are involved regarding the landing charges. It would be very useful to me, if I could have the benefit of the advice of a British merchant, Mr. Lyle of Basra, for choice, during these negotiations. No special suspicion would be caused by hisga I &lt; ■' ■ £ deputation and the fact that we were openly ^cussing 0 — with Sheikh Mubarak would discreetly veil the real objec * , rverv hope that we should find Sheikh Mubarak ready to meet us half-way and thaUhe customs matter would be placed, at least on paper oiiat ' ^ satisfactory footing. It would be essential, in that case, that I should be given full authority to conclude both agreements without further reference to the best of my ability. . . My efforts would then be concentrated in the endeavour to obtain, as tar as possible, a uniform rate on all goods—a percentage, which,^ I think, could be settled at 5 per cent or less on the value, as shown by invoices, irrespective of the value of the goods in the local market. In the event of invoices sus pected false, three methods suggest themselves as feasible— (1) Customs to buy at 25 per cent excess of invoice value. (2) Customs to buy at their own rate at which they have assessed. (3) Arbitration by nominees of both parties with referee to be appointed by the Sheikh. The choice of method should he left to the merchant. 7. I would respectfully subscribe to your views on the slave question. 8. With reference to Turkey, I could perhaps arrange to delete the present allusion to Turkey that exists in the draft agreement, but it will be difficult and give rise to the impression that we are afraid of that Power. 9. I would earnestly deprecate any further allusion to Turkey whatever. Undoubtedly the guarantee that the Sheikh is pressing for is that we shall not . take his country from him. The idea of protection against foreign or Turkish aggression is not present to his mind in this connection at all: and cautious ‘ non-committing declarations as to our policy in the event of outside claims will only be interpreted by the crude Arab mind, ever prone to think evil of others, to mean that, at the first hint of danger, we shall leave him in the lurch. 10. I venture to hope that it will not be difficult to include Warba island within the circle of pre-emption, but I fear that the fixing of prices at present will delay the agreement indefinitely. I find myself in some difficulty to dtcide what arguments I am to use to induce the Sheikh to tie himself down now to a price which we are not compelled to purchase at. As it was, though I have not mentioned this fact hitherto, I was forced to some extent to stiffen my back to acquire the whole of the Shweikh concession. The Sheikh even went so far as to offer a material reduction in the price, if we would content ourselves with half the foreshore. I believe he offered to lease at half the rate per cubit. I mention this now to show that the Sheikh is not too eager to sell and that he confidently anticipates a large rise in the value of the lands adjacent to the railway, wherever it may run, and that he hopes to share in the profit. fortiori^ he will he still less disposed to tie himself down to a price at which we are not hound to buy. 11. It would be possible to commence negotiations for the fixing of the price, as soon as the original agreement has been signed and our position would he only slightly weaker. r • te n( is to complicate the negotiations still further is lhat the Sheikh will probably have a decided preference for Shweikh or Has Kathama as the railway terminus. These positions would only tend to disturb slightly the vested interests in Koweit town. It would be with very different feehngs that he would view a settlement at Warba. He would feel that we should be considerably more independent of his wishes at that distance, and that even if he should resolve on the heroic measure of moving his entire town somewhere in that direction, he would only be exposing himself more fully to the danger c f Turkish aggression. The line that I anticipate he would wish the negotiations to follow would be that, while he would part on reasonable terms with his rights in Warba to prevent a foreign settlement there, he would require a guarantee from the British Government that, if the future terminus lay in their hands, they would do their best 10 bring the line to Koweit.3 • , 13 ' I X r I] 1CT ’ 14 oeours to 1110 as probable that the Sheikh will regard the inclusion of Warba in the pre-emption circle as confirmatory evidence of his right to that island and that he might possibly offer to throw in Umm Gasar and Sefwan village to boot. I presume that, in that case, my best course would be to represent that this would involve a further reference to Govern ment on a controversial point and deprecate its submission at this iuncture pointing out to the Sheikh that he would always be at liberty to extend the circle of pre-emption later, if he thought fit. 14. I have dwelt on this matter of Warba at some length, as I wished to show that there are many considerations involved, and I would he the last person to say that I have been able to exhaust all the various obiections in a couple of paragraphs. I am not at all convinced that it would not be better purely from a local point of view, to postpone the Warba concession, until the question of the price of the Kathama lands is ripe for presentation, and that the line for me to take would be to press for economical rates for Warba as a mere thorn in the side of our opponents, while all our and Sheikh Mubarak’s endeavours would be concentrated on the bringing of the railway to Koweit someway beyond Turkish ken.

And I reminded M. Geofi'ray of what I had already said to M.

I have, &amp;c. (Signed) N. B. O’CONOR. Inclosure in No. 1. Acting Consul Heathcote-Smith to Sir N. O'Conor. (No. 25.) Sir &gt; . Aleppo, July 17, 1907. I HAVE the honour to state that 1 arrived at Aleppo from Constantinople, having as far as possible followed the proposed route of the Bagdad Bailway. The nature of the first two days travel, which bring one to Konia, is a matter of common knowledge. When the splendid station at Konia, with its adjoining first-class hotel erected by the Anatolian Bailway Company, are left behind, the train continues its path over the endless and monotonous plateau which it had been traversing ever since leaving Eski-Shehr. The permanent-way on this last section has been constructed so as to allow trains to run at 100 kilom. (62| miles) the hour, although up to Konia the line was built to allow of only 60 to 70 kilom. an hour. The country here, as before, is only moderately fertile, and would require some big irrigation scheme to be carried out (it has been proposed to utilize Lake Bey-Shehr) to make it richly productive. The treeless plain, dotted with but rare villages, and these always far distant from the stations, continues up to Eregli, a small, unprepossessing kaimakamlik, that showed no visible signs of having benefited from the presence of the railway. All along this section the stations are most excellent buildings, and everything has been done to give an impression of power and wealth. Although the higher officials are German, there has been no attempt to give too German a character to the line. Not a word of German is to be seen anywhere; all notices are in the two languages, Turkish and French, and, where necessary, Armenian and Greek also. There is a certain amount of ineffectual opposition to the railway in this district, for the existence of the camels as a means of transport is being vitally menaced. The houses of this region are miserable, being usually one-storied, and at that built with mud walls; the inhabitants, who are Turkish (Anadols), wear expressions of the most apathetic ignorance, and a long time would elapse before they would feel the need of wants which cannot be supplied locally ; of course, the railway would still be useful in exporting their produce. From Eregli, a town of some 300 dwellings, marked by a belt of trees, I passed on to the 8th kilom. beyond, where the railway, after passing a small station called Boulgourlou, some 3 miles from a village of the same name, suddenly ends abruptly in a field, without a stick or stone to show the direction of the proposed continuation. Here begin the lower spurs of the Taurus Mountains, and after a gradual and easy ascent for some hours, during which the country becomes more and more stoney, and all signs of habitations are left behind, the line would enter the actual mountains, passing to the left of the Bulgar mine, a rich silver-lead deposit, now being imperfectly worked by the Sultan. At this point, near a place called Chifle Han, a long and winding narrow defile would have to be negotiated, and the railway would finally find its way through the Cilician Gates, or there is an alternative route through the hills rather to the north. In any case, a great number of tunnels would be necessary, and the nature of the country be similar—massive rocky defiles; in all, some sixteen to twenty tunnels have been judged necessary.

It is said that the capital has already been mostly at Mersma, Mr. Bellart, has made transferred to German hands, and the new managei -- -- - • -i + c several alterations by which the Company shall be run on lines more similar to those of the Anatolian Railway. . At Eregli there were no foreigners of any kind. In Adana itselr theie aie some four Germans, who have tried to acquire land, but all kinds ot difficulties have been put in their way, and requests for Concessions to build factories have been met with the same persistent opposition by the Turks. Adana is undoubtedly a glowing town, but a railway from it towards Killis, and then on to Aleppo, provided a line was constructed at the same period to Alexandretta, would probably cause all the commerce to flow by way of Alexandretta rather than benefit Adana and Mersina, which lie on the other side of the Amanus (Giaour) Mountains. Continuing the road through the cotton-fields to the east, the line was marked out by telegraph poles as far on as Missis at the time of the original construction of the Mersina-Adana Railway. At Missis some isolated hills begin, but the railway could circumvent these. The large and growing Kaza of Hamidie is soon reached from Missis. This township, which is bustling with life, was formerly called Yuzgat, but the Sultan had it peopled with Circassian immigrants and named it after himself. Counting the neighbouring villages, there are now some 12,000 inhabitants there. The soil all round here is extremely fertile, and the line would run along in the plain as far as Osmanieh, a small and sleepy kaza of about 1,500 inhabitants lying at the entrance of a long valley leading due east into the Amanus Mountains. From this point onwards to Killis there are no sort of roads at present, and rough horse-tracks are the only ways leading across the mountains. Villages are rare, but not as infrequent as in the Taurus Mountains, while cultivation is carried on to a much greater extent, and the country from here to Bagtche can be described as being very moderately fertile. Some tw r o hours’ ride from Osmanieh the railway would have a difficult hill to over come, and then would enter the broad valley of the Kara Su up to Bagtche, a tiny kaza among the mountains. From here onwards to Kazan Ali the engineering would be of extreme difficulty, and several long tunnels would be necessary. When the stoney hills have been passed by the horse-track there is an almost sheer descent of many hundred feet into a plain (Arslan Plain) which runs due north and south. The railway would emerge on to the plain near Kazan Ali, a village which is just a collection of a tew mud huts deserted in summer owing to the heat. The line would here run due south past the ruins of Shamal, where German excavations have been going on. The plain is fertile but again very sparsely populated. Islahie, a small kaza of barely 1,000 inhabitants lies on tie route, but otherwise, from Bagtche to Killis, nothing but villages are passed/ eyond Islahie there is a large forest, and the country here is considered unsafe, but cei tainly not in a degree to affect the building of a railway. From here onwards V V f UW \ e v 6 south ™ ds alon S the of the Kurd Mountains, and though a g i deal of embanking, cutting, and bridging-over would have to be undertaken no tunnels should be necessary. The line would pass some 8 miles south-east from Killis following an easterly direction. The country all round here is of an extre^ fertff 1 woTin^ Very P ' entlfUl! th6 inhabitaDtS eVen the rare reputation o being ha ’ i rom here on to Aleppo the country is well known.

I am aware that Sii A. Block has on various occasions deprecated the hypothecation of additional revenues for the purpose of kilometric guarantees, for the reason that the Ottoman Government does not secure an adequate return for the sacrifices made, and that such hypothecation must therefore result in the accumulation of external and unproductive debt, but the fact that the Council of the Debt has already consented to levy revenues allocated to the Koniah-Eregli section of the Bagdad Railway would not improbably be used as an argument for not withholding its services in the collection of revenues allocated to other sections of the railway.

IN the course of conversation with my Russian colleague a few weeks ago his Excellency told me that he believed the German Minister, M. de Kiderlen, was doing all he could to persuade the Sultan to give a formal guarantee of certain revenues for the issue of State bonds for the next two or three sections of the Bagdad Railway, or at any rate for the Taurus section. The estimated cost of this section is about 120,000,000 fr., of which 54,000,000 fr. would be represented by the new issue, and the balance provided by the surplus of the Eregli section and by loans from the issue of new shares of the Anatolian Railway Company, and the appropriation of that Company’s reserve funds. A Greek banker, who is a member of the Anatolian Railway Board, much interested also in the Bagdad Railway, called upon me to-day and gave me confidentially the following information :— He said that he had written a short time ago to M. Gwinner pointing out that, even if the Porte were inclined to hypothecate certain revenues for the Bagdad Railway, it was almost certain that the British and French Delegates on the Debt would be instructed to refuse to collect those revenues, and that in this case they would really be of little value as neither the Imperial Government nor the Bagdad Railway Company were in a position to effect the collection. For this and other reasons my informant advised that the further construction of the line should be suspended for the present to allow time for further negotiations with the British and French Governments. It was not, he said, desirable that the financiers who were interested in the Bagdad Railway and sympathized with the enterprise should be loaded up with unmarketable stock. M. Gwinner had thanked him for his letter, and replied that what he said would receive most careful consideration. My informant w^ent on to say that he believed this view was shared by a good number of the Board, but that it was opposed by M. Testa, German member of the Ottoman Debt Council, and the confidential adviser of Baron von Marschall, and that, while talking on the subject a short time ago to the German Ambassador in Paris, his Excellency told him that his lips were closed as regards the Bagdad Railway, but that he confessed he did not understand the attitude of M. Testa and those who wished to rush the question before it was seen whether any arrangement with England and France were practicable. My informant’s own opinion was that the Germans would shortly be obliged to approach the British and French Governments again. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) N. R. O’CONOR. Hi 19 . 0 .

(No. 320. Confidential.) Sir, Berlin, July 12, 1907. I HAVE tlie honour to transmit to you herewith a copy of the Annual Report of the Anatolian Railway for the year 1906.' ::: ' A short precis of the contents has been made. The result hardly seems to be very satisfactory as compared with the preceding year. There appears to have been a general shrinkage in receipts as against a slight increase in working expenses and, of course, an increase in the amount due by the Turkish Government for kilometric guarantees. Thanks to the latter, a dividend at 6 per cent.—the same rate which was paid last year—has been declared. In p. 8 (first paragraph) of the Report made to you by the Bagdad Railway Committee on the 26th March last, figures were given as to the gross receipts per mile of the Eski-Chehir-Konieh section, and the working expenses per mile of the whole line from Haidar Pasha to Konieh for the year 1905. These figures were quoted as an indication of the probable position of the Konieh-Eregli section of the Bagdad Railway. I beg to inclose a note comparing these figures with those of 1906. I also beg to inclose the Report of the Company for the port of Haidar Pasha,'' wdiich is practically in the same hands as the Anatolian Railway. This Report is given in both French and German.

S0 P e conversa ;ti 011 yesterday with Dr. von Schwabach on the subiect ^ Railway, and more especially in regard to the rumour published in the Standard that a concession had been received by the Germans to construct a railway from Bagdad to Tehran, with extensions to Hillah and Kerhela Dr. von Schwabach, who is a Director of the railway, assured me that there was no truth m the rumour, for the following reasons :— 1. If the Deutsche Bank had received such a concession, negotiations on the subject must have taken place both at Tehran and Constantinople, and it was inconceivable that a hint of these negotiations should not have reached Sir N O’Conor or Sir C. Spring-Bice. 2. The Deutsche Bank were at present very busy with the scheme of constructing the railway beyond Eregli, and he doubted if they were able to conduct the two schemes at the same time. It was, of course, possible that the German group had obtained a blocking concession of the railway from Bagdad to Tehran, with no obligation to commence construction themselves; but he was inclined to believe there was no truth in the rumour. He then introduced me to Herr Testa, formerly German Dragoman at the Embassy in Constantinople, and now Bepresentative of the German bondholders on the Ottoman Debt. Herr Testa was very positive that there was no truth in the story. He declared several times that he had beard no word of it at Constantinople, and he repeated Dr. von Schwabach’s argument that, had any negotiations of the kind taken place, His Majesty’s Legation at Tehran could not have failed to hear of them. I asked him what would, in his opinion, be the basis of the rumour, and he replied that he thought that it owed its origin to the concession granted in the Convention of March 1903 to construct a railway from Sadije to Khanikin, and he also said that the Persian Ambassador at the time the Convention was concluded was a gentleman who possessed large estates on the Turco-Persian frontier. His Excellency, who hoped to profit considerably by the line were it constructed, had been very anxious to procure its construction. ; C. Berlin, June 10, 1907.

Majesty's Government.! mereial and financial questions, has recently published a statement to the “effect that the “ Porte, which is m negotiation with the Ottoman Bank for a loan based on the receipts of the lighthouses, has concluded an arrangement with the hank for the advance of 200,000/., at 7 per cent, interest, and has assigned as security the surplus of the revenus concedes. This operation concluded with the consent of the Sultan cannot fail to excite much attention, any assignment of the surplus of the revenus concedes having been considered as out of the question, as Turkey was reservino* them for the continuation of the Bagdad Bailway. It is impossible to disguise the fact that the further progress of that enterprise is postponed ad calendas Gracas” An article in a subsequent number of this paper, entitled “ Manoeuvres against the continuation of the Bagdad Bail way,” repeats the same statements, adding that this operation may be looked .on as the preliminary attack of the enemies of the railway in order to hinder its progress, and that probably the Branco -English forces which inspired it are trying to get control of the surplus of the revenus concedes with a view to extorting better terms for their participation in the scheme. No notice of the foregoing is taken by the &lt;£ Kolnische Zeitung,” which announces that Baron von Marschall, before quitting Constantinople on leave, received the most satisfactory, though verbal, assurances as to the employment of this surplus for kilometric guarantees. An inquiry was recently undertaken by the “ Gaulois ” as to the opinion of prominent business men in Germany with regard to closer financial and commercial relations with Erance. In the course of the interview with the correspondent of that paper, Herr Gwinner, the Director of the Deutsche Bank, said:— “ Have we not for example equal interests in the Bagdad Bailway Company respecting which so many gross inaccuracies have been circulated ? I can speak with authority on the subject, as I am the President of this Company which some persist in calling German, but which is essentially international.” There may be some doubt as to whether Herr Gwinner’s statement was made with the object of obtaining more Erench capital without Erench control or whether, paving the way to an international understanding.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 204 of the 10th instant, I have the honour to transmit ^herewith a precis of an article published in the “ Berliner Neueste Nachrichten” of the 14th instant, under the heading, “ Der Streich gegen die Bagdad- bahn,” in which England and France are accused of having worked on the Porte°so as to prevent the construction of a further stretch of the Bagdad Bail way, and Germany’s interests are described as having been thus betrayed. The writer, however, is convinced that the line will, nevertheless, he completed as far as the Persian Gulf, and by the energy and support of Germany alone. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) PRANK C. LASCELLES. Inclosure in No. 1. Precis of Article in the “ Berliner Neueste Nachrichten ” of May 14, 1907. NOW that the Grand Vizier Eerid Pasha has entered into negotiations with the Ottoman Bank in order to prevent the construction of the Bagdad Railway by Germany, the question of the decrease of German influence with the Porte has become part of that disagreeable diplomatic question, &lt;c the isolation of Germany.” When such a friendship as that between Germany and Turkey suddenly begins to appear questionable, it is time to look into the matter. It is undeniable that the reform work in Macedonia is not yet assured, in spite of the fact that the Protocol for the 3 per cent, increase in duties was signed on the 25th of last month. England and America, as well as other small Powers, are procrastinating, and even seem inclined to withdraw their consent. If this attempt at reform fails, as is to be feared, its moral effect on German influence in the Orient will be considerable, and it is small consolation to think that Austria-Hungary and Russia will share the misfortune. Even if these reforms are successful, the reward for Germany’s years of work will be a direct jeopardizing of German undertakings in Turkey. The costs of the Macedonian reform will be paid indirectly by Germany, as a result of the loan of 200,000/. from the Ottoman Bank. Germany might justly expect that a portion of the receipts from the rise in customs should be used for the increase of the guarantee of interest for the construction of the Bagdad Railway. Suddenly the Porte needs money “ urgently,” not only to pay overdue wages, but to^ carry on war in Jemen, and to provide for the dowry of the Sultan’s daughter, which seem very inadequate causes for the loan. There is no doubt that England and Prance have led the Porte to a breach of faith with Germany. The Grand Vizier himself has tried to reimburse German capital by giving the German Bank the concessions for irrigating the extremely fertile plain of Konia, and draining the equally advantageous marsh land at Pski- Shehr. Such compensation cannot make amends for the commercial and political damage arising from a delay or hindrance in the completion of the railway to the Persian Gulf. Even if Perid Pasha gave over all the marshes of Turkey to German Companies, that fathomless morass, the greed of certain officials, would tax e strength of a Hercules. As long as there are Powers that from time to time satisfy this auri sacra fames, the influence of these Powers will continually change m ui ey. German political influence in Turkey consists in the personal confidence w nc the Sultan reposes in the Kaiser, and also in the respect for Germany’s military power. German influence would begin to decrease if the German officers, who oim e [2490 1]! 1 if i 1 if f I'- majority ot tb. o»«- '» T ”“ sf •‘“■gif iLjj'm.”.; longer feared in the O^nt, and *h lst M ay, just before the German seem to have been only too successful. n Marschal i was obliged to protest Ambassador’s departure, the blow came, a must have been ver j to the Sultan against such a ,^f “^^^^tory disagreement between Germaf effective.

Sir, Foreign Office, June ^ , 1907. X AM directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to transmit to you the accompanvin 0, copy of a Memorandum, which has been communicated to the French and llussian Ambassadors at this Court, on the subject of the attitude of His Majesty’s Government in regard to British co-operation in the Bagdad Bail way. In view of recent developments in this question, I am to suggest, for the consideration of Mr. Secretary Morley, that it may now be expedient to arrive at a decision as to the purchase of a plot of land on the foreshore at Bunder-es-Schwaik, a point 2 or 3 miles south-west of Eoweit, which may not improbably be the terminus of the Bagdad Bailway on the Persian Gulf. As you are aware, the purchase of the land in question was proposed by the Besident in the Persian Gulf in a despatch dated the 1] th Kovember, 1905, which formed the inclosure in your letter of the 17th January, 190b ; but it was eventually ' dropped owing to the apprehensions of His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople that the scheme might arouse Turkish susceptibilities. Sir E. Grey would be glad to learn whether, in Mr. Morley’s opinion, this land could, in the event of its acquisition being decided upon, be most conveniently purchased by the Political Agent at Koweit, to be eventually transferred to the Railway Company, or whether it would be more advisable if it were bought by some existing Company, such as the British India Steam Navigation Company.uvn, i' (No. 230.) Sir, Foreign Office, June 6, 1907. I GAVE Count BenckendorfT to-day, confidentially, a Memorandum representino 1 our views on the Bagdad Bailway. Mhen he had read it, he asked whether this was a proposal on our part. 1 said we had no intention of making any proposal to the German Government; hut if they made a proposal to us, our answer would be on these lines. I had drawn up the Memorandum for information only, and especially because the French Govern ment had told us that they would not encourage French participation in the Bagdad Bailway unless our participation was also to be arranged. Under these circumstances the French Government had a right to know what our attitude was. If our attitude was to be one of irreconcilable opposition it would obviously stultify the line which the French Government had taken, assuming that they desired French participation. I had therefore set forth the conditions on which we should be prepared to participate, in order that the French Government might know that we were not irreconcilable, and what our conditions were. Government, but that this Memorandum was given for their information, and I did not press for any reply. It might be that the Bagdad Bailway would make no progress for some time, and little would be heard of the matter. But I thought the railway would be made sooner or later, and it was for the Russian Government to consider what conditions would be acceptable to them with regard to their own participation. I further observed that Germany was very sensitive to the conclusion of agree ments, one after the other, to which she was not a party. And, if she wished to have an agreement to prove that no ring fence was being made against her, the Bagdad Bailway might provide an opportunity for her to make an agreement with Bussia, France, and ourselves. ment. Count Benckendorff asked whether I expected a reply from the Bussian Govern- t. I told him I should be willing at any time to hear the views of the BussianMEMORANDUM. (Confidential.) Lansdowne on the 5th May, 1903. ^ at on made by Lord ,, f'*’,^. art . political aspects of the question, the commercial position of Great Britain in the Mesopotamian delta is altogether exceptional. This nosTt on ha been steadily consolidated since the foundation, upwards of two and a half centuries Host English factory at Bussorah; in 1766 a British Resident was appointed of ff v n' t a i Bussoral1 J; lK ' r &lt;; has long been a British Consul, eharfred with the care British trade, represented by 96 per cent, of the shipping coming into the port and )y tie Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, who are the principal carriers of merchandize between Bussorah and Bagdad, and who are subsidized by the Government of India for the carnage of mails. Such is now the nature of these ™-- al interests that the trade of Bagdad and Bussorah, valued at 2,500 000/ in 1903, is predominantly m the hands of British and Indian merchants. Moreover, the annual pilgrimage of British subjects to the Shiah shrines is continually increasing, the numbers in 1905 exceeding 11,000. In these circumstances His Majesty’s Government may justly consider, both on political and commercial grounds, that their attitude towards the Bagdad Railway should not he disregarded by the promoters of the undertaking. .They have concluded that this attitude could not be actively favourable unless British participation in the scheme were assured and rendered permanent on equitable terms, and they are persuaded that such participation can only be arranged if Great Britain secures the^ construction and control of the railway from a point north of Bagdad to the Persian Gulf. They are prepared to agree, in regard to traffic rates, &amp;c., to equality of treatment for all countries over the entire railway from sea to sea' » hut they could not be a party to the internationalization of the line under a system of i kilometric guarantees such as the Concession of 1903 has established. Whatever may be the financial arrangements in regard to the rest of the line, His Majesty’s Govern ment could not, so far as the British portion were concerned, accept responsibility for a system of which in principle they disapprove. If such conditions of this nature as might prove satisfactory could be arranged, His Majesty’s Government, in order' to insure their realization and the completion of this part of the railway, would be willing to consider the question of themselves giving a guarantee to enable the necessary British capital to he raised for that portion of the railway in regard to whicJi their control would cover their responsibility. His Majesty’s Government are further of opinion that the predominant position of British trade w T ould justify the concession to British contractors of such harbour works as might he required at Bagdad, Bussorah, and Koweit. The further details of British co-operation, such as adequate representation on the international Board which would regulate such matters as through traffic and equalization of rates, would be the subject of subsequent arrangement. His Majesty’s Government fully realize that the initiation and concession of the railway have been due to German enterprise, and are quite willing to consider favourably any practical suggestion for preserving to the Company its German origin, which would not impair the international character that the administration of the line should, in their opinion, assume from the moment it becomes a sea-to-sea connection, and consequently an important through route to the East.

Sir, Constantinople, April 17, 1907, I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith copy of an interesting letter which X have received from Mr. Percy Loraine, from Aleppo] reporting conversations which ho had with the Yalis of Beyrout and Aleppo, mainly regarding the Bagdad Hail way. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) N. R. O’CONOR. Inclosure in No. 1 . Mr. P. Loraine to Sir N. O’Conor. Sir, Aleppo, March 25, 1907. IT may perhaps be of interest to report that on my arrival at Beyrout on the 20 th instant, Sir R. Drummond*Hay took me to call on the Yali, that on my arriving here Mr. Longworth presented me yesterday to the Yali of Aleppo, and that their Excellencies Halil Pasha and Nazim Pasha respectively touched on the question of the Bagdad Railway in the course of conversation, though no reference whatever had previously been made to that subject. Halil Pasha asked me whether it was known at Constantinople how soon the Germans intended to continue the construction of the line to Adana. I replied that no announcement had yet been made on the subject, and that, as far as I knew, everyone there was in the dark about it. Elis Excellency went on to say what a great expense the railway, with its large kilometric guarantees, was to the Ottoman Government; in his belief, the Germans would continue the construction as far as Adana, but they would not get any further without the co-operation of England, Prance, and Russia. Why, he said, does not England offer to build a railway to Bagdad without a kilometric guarantee ? The country it would traverse is rich, and the development it would undergo when opened up by the railway would render a guarantee unnecessary. I asked his Excellency how this could be, as the Concession for the construction of a railway to Bagdad had already been granted by the Sultan. He replied that was a question that depended on what interpretation was placed on the wording of the Concession. A Concession, it was true, had been given, but according to its terms the railway was to pass through certain places; if an alternative tracee which did not clash with the letter of the German Concession were proposed by a party willing to construct without guarantees, it would be possible to accept it, and thus to allow the remainder of the German Concession to fall through. Nazim Pasha, the Yali of Aleppo, approached the subject in precisely the same way as Halil Pasha had done, and I answered in the same sense as previously. After remarking on the large sums the Bagdad Railway was costing the Ottoman Government, his Excellency went on to point out the superiority, in point of view both of cheapness and distance, of a line from Alexandretta to Meskene through Aleppo, connected w T ith Bagdad, Bussorah, and the Persian Gulf by a steamer service on the Euphrates ; if an English Company w r ould come forward and propose to constiuc such a line vrithout a kilometric guarantee, he felt sure it 'would succeed. ^ . I had the opportunity of again speaking with his Excellency this evening, and in the meantime had remembered having heard of a British Company w ic i a proposed about fifteen years ago to construct such a railway and to ma *e e Euphrates navigable for steamers, and, further, that at about that elute the memopo y of navigation on the Tigris and Euphrates had been granted to the Civi E 1S • 'j 3 Nazim Pasha if this 'were the case, and he replied in the affirmative, adding ia e fact that a steamer had plied up to Meskene in the time of Midhat Pas in piove a [2469 i/—1]2 lo tt p admitted that the navigation •steamer navigation on the Euphrates possessed of changing its bed from was difficult owing to the habit which the ^ into a na vigahle condition at time to time but estimated the cost oi o new proposal to establish a steamer 50,0001.

WITH reference to your despatch No. Vfi of the 4 th ultimo, I have the honour to transmit herewith a despatch which I have received this morning from Mr Consul- General Oppenheimer, giving me his views on the subject of the Bagdad Railway scheme so far as it is affected by the financial situation in Germany. I have, &amp;c. (Bor Sir Trank Lascelles), (Signed) GRANVILLE. Inclosure in No. 1 . Consul-General Oppenheimer to Sir F. Lascelles. (Confidential.) Sir ’ r r&gt;™ x , i . Frankfort-on-the-Main, March 12, 1907. 1 BLG to acknowledge the receipt of your Excellency’s despatch dated the 9 th February, inclosing copy of a report from His Majesty’s Minister Resident at Munich respecting the Bagdad Radway scheme so far as it is affected by the financial situation in Germany, and requesting me to furnish you with my views on the subject, His Majesty’s Government being anxious to receive full and accurate information. In reply I beg to state as follows :— 1 J There is no doubt that since M. Dernburg has taken charge of the Colonial Department in Berlin a new interest has been awakened in transmaritime matters. If the diffidence in German colonial undertakings cannot be expected to vanish outrioht German financial schemes oversea, whether in German territory or not, must in 'the long run benefit from the appointment. To the German mind, which is accustomed to paternal government, the crux lies not so much in the question whether the capital is invested under the German flag or not, but whether the enterprise in which it is invested has the support of the Government. This being secured, there might indeed be a preference in the case of oversea expansion for territories in which there is not the danger of a constant contact with the inferior grades of German officials (“ Assessoren- Wirthschaft ”). Since M. Dernburg’s appointment the support of the Government has in all commercial questions become all the more valuable, as he is a commercial and financial expert of the very first class, and, while he is sure to take a broad view of commercial schemes, it is hoped that his views will carry considerable weight also with his colleagues. M. Dernburg’s very appointment, then, has inspired confidence; though he may have been none too popular as a bank Director, he is certainly as the Head of the Colonial Department not unpopular with the commercial majority of the country, and more especially with his own fraternity of the “ haute finance.” His appointment constituted such an innovation in the traditional agrarian and junker regime of Germany that the commercial world, led by the &lt;c haute finance,” seems ab initio inclined, from feelings akin to those of freemasonry, to assist him in making his appointment a success. During his agitatorial campaign preceding the last general election he met everywhere with a warm reception, which was nowhere warmer than in Frankfort, where he delivered an excellent, and perhaps his most sober, speech because no doubt he knew that his audience was greatly composed of former colleagues, of men who are shrewd leaders in the world of finance. I think that a real effort would, if necessary, be made by them to save him the humiliation of failure, because his appointment constitutes a new departure decidedly to the credit of their calling, which, until then, had not been favoured by any great official distinction; if the appointment [2404 s—1]2 proved unsuccessful the departure will stand discredited and is not likely to be repeated ^ WAhrSV* silent conviction that ^the ^ M. Dernburg he will use his m uence « ^ to s0 prominent ^ reform of the bourse laws, for s . , knowledge of the defects of the present position in Germany w,th ^equally tlmroufrh kno ^ ^ bank legislation under which, until q 1 i 'l him with all the greater confidence in himself to suffer. The financia wor an( i tenacious, and the right man to this respect because he is ( y le ] iea( l 0 f the Empire cannot deny that see a matter through; even h'scolleagnesa “ therefore not at all unlikely that he is an authority upon the subject of finance^ It^s there if any financial becaure M. lernburg would have a ^pro quo to offer, and the money would probably be found as a part of a secret understanding, ^e ^ Goverament which is well advised would _ put M Dernburw forward in case it wished to secure the help of the naute finance for any other transmaritime enterprise, e.g., the Bagdad Railway scheme Here, again, the same basis for a bargain exists-possibly with a slight disadvantage to the because the usual argument of patriotism could not be used On the o Mi ’ he ^ e is no doubt that in the eyes of many Germans a part of Turkey, namely, s Minor is considered more thoroughly German than some of the German Colonies. The so-called “ Levante-Tariff ” has worked wonders in the German commercial conquest of Asia Minor I have it from British merchants that Englishmen abandoned these markets because there was no longer any cash in them, but onlj &lt;; paper,” and that the profits were rendered illusory by the long period over which their realization was protracted. If Germany to-day controls these markets and is shipping great quantities of all sorts ihf merchandize to the Levant it may suit her own industrial purposes; for, especially in times of commercial depression, as, e.g., 1901 and 1902, these maikets enable her to keep her greatly increased commercial concerns working. The system of prolonged credit is one of the concessions made by Germans wherewith to conquer new markets, hut they seem to forget that it is difficult to change the system once the markets have been secured on this basis, and such commercial transactions are not apt m the long run to foster a friendly spirit from the buyer towards the seller -nor, indeed, vice versd. The returns of the quantities shipped, though they may seem highly satisfactory, constitute no proper criterion wherewith to gauge the real value of the market. The German Emperor is said occasionally to use the phrase “ My friend the Sultan.” The remark expresses a sentiment which is gladly accepted by the Germans, because it represents a valuable item in the international commercial competition in Asia Minor. The German press prominently records the constant exchange of courtesies which takes place between Berlin and Constantinople. If it proudly lingers over the German diplomatic successes there (e.g., the removal of Eehmi Pasha) it becomes all the more remarkable that the Bagdad Railway scheme is never referred t 0 —partly, no doubt, because it is not officially intended that any foreign interest in the scheme should be unduly roused, but partly also because to the commercial world it has always seemed to harbour possibilities of international entanglements, and it thus would introduce an item of uncertainty into a market which, with its long credits, requires more than all others a peaceful development. The scheme itself has, so far, only interested the “ haute finance,” because until its various stages are completed it is of no practical value to the commercial community at large. If money were needed for the furtherance of the scheme, I think that “ industry ” would prove most unwilling to subscribe, more especially as the recent good years have tightened the money market all round, and “ industry ” has already raised all available money to sink it in the enlargement of its concerns at home. Probably your Excellency is aware that the constructive work of the Bagdad Railway is being carried out by a Frankfort firm (Philipp Holzmann and Co.), so that it is natural that a certain interest in the scheme has been kept alive by the “ haute finance” in Frankfort, which is also financially interested in Philipp Holzmann and Co., officially styled “ Internationale Baugesellschaft, Frankfurt-a.-M.,” and the shares of which are held in a few hands. The interest in the scheme, however, centres in Berlin, as the Deutsche Bank is exclusively intrusted by a Turkish Irade with the financial part of the enterprise (payment of interest and amortization). The Director of the Deutsche Bank, who is the moving spirit in the matter, is Herr Gwinner ; he is also a Director of the “ Internationale Baugesellschaft ” above mentioned.From inquiries which I caused to be made in different local quarters, it would, however, appear that even the local “ haute finance ” is none too well informed upon the subject. Prospectuses dated Constantinople, 4th (17th) February, 1319 (1904), are in its possession, but beyond its contents little seems known. If inquiries are met with w great reticence, I am led^ to believe that want of any definite information is its cause. French^ and British participation in the scheme are spoken of without any definite indication ; the Deutsche Bank, backed in this respect probably by the G-overnment, is apparently keeping its information to itself. One of my personal friends who is in touch with very vast American concerns confidentially approached a leading Frankfort financier, asking whether there was any opening for investing American money to a considerable extent in the Bagdad Railway scheme, on the condition, ot course, that the American interests would then be repre sented on the Board. The suggestion was (so to say) laughed out of court; it was explained that if Americans wished to subscribe on the condition of obtaining a voice in the management (though it was not admitted that American money, even in con siderable sums, was welcome) this could only be done in the following way : If it were decided to accept the American offer, a reliable bank in the States (reliable in its loyalty to German interests) would be carefully selected, and would then be instructed to receive subscriptions in the States, after it had been previously arranged that a particular Director of the American concern would be appointed to represent, outwardly at least, the American interests on the Managing Board of the Bagdad Railway scheme. Thus the man representing the American interests would of course be nothing but a tool in German hands. Presumably a similar course would be followed in England if there were any intention of inviting general subscriptions there. I have it on absolutely trustworthy authority that the Bagdad Railway scheme to-day stands as follows :— The French and the German financial groups have come to an agreement concerning the continuation of the railway, according to which the Germans construct the Taurus line from Eregli to Adana (220 kilom.) ; the French construct the next portion, to Haleb (Aleppo) (200-300 kilom.); this would give the French at Aleppo a junction for their railway lines in Syria, w-hich, until now, have proved profitless invest ments. It is generally believed that Great Britain is endeavouring to prevent the construction of the Taurus line. As there is no inclination under these circumstances to give Great Britain any chance of influence, British capital for the Taurus line is not wanted—for which, moreover, the capital is secured. If former negotiations with Great Britain have been discontinued for about a year, there is at present, from the German point of view, no reason for reopening them. As far as can be foreseen, there is, however, no reason why negotiations should not be resumed after the Taurus lines have been completed. In fact, there seems to-day on the part of Germany a prospective desire that the negotiations should then be resumed, but not until then. I have, &amp;e.

It secures supreme British control over the portion of the railway in which Britisli interests are most vitally concerned. Such control is, in our opinion, essentia , and cannot be obtained under any system of internationalization • ^ II. Without a Government guarantee it is very doubtful whethei British capital can be attracted. The guarantee proposed would attract investors who would, be satisfied with a safe 3 per cent. . TT . nr • . &gt; n III. A further advantage of a scheme of this kind is that His Majesty s Govern ment would have no part in the existing system of kilometric guarantees, which is very ininrious to Turkey’s financial interests, and involves the payment of sums largely m excess of the actual requirements. We think it highly desirable that His Majesty s Government should give no countenance to any such system. . , IV. We are aware that, in the first instance, a proposal from His Majesty s Govern ment to take over, at their own cost and risk, the Mosul or Bagdad-Gulf sections of the railway would probably meet with opposition on the part of the German Government on political grounds, as it would deprive the scheme of its preponderantly German character. On the other hand, it appears clear that the German Government, m view of the difficulties of carrying out the scheme single-handed, are desirous of British co-operation. Our co-operation would relieve the German Government of anxiety as to the attitude His Majesty’s Government would adopt respecting the harbour in the Persian Gulf, if the line is brought there as an exclusively German one. It appears from the information available at present that Koweit, where we have special interests, is the most convenient terminus. The German Government, if we co-operate, will also avoid political opposition at Constantinople. The financial and commercial advantages of British co-operation on the linesPART I.

Of the 80 per cent subscribed by the Deutsche Bank group, 70 per cent, is said* to have been subscribed m nearly equal proport ons by Flinch 1 ’and German groups, and 10 per cent, by groups ot Swiss and other nationalities. The Sultan is said personally to hold a certain number of sha.es The Statutes provide that the affairs of the Company shall be managed hy an Administrative Council of at least eleven members three of whom are to be appointed by the Anatolian Railway Company, and the remainder by the General Assemblv of tne Bagdad Railway Company, with the proviso that three members of the Council shall be Turkish subjects. The powers of the Council are very wide, including the right to “transiger et compromettre ” on behalf of the Company. Members of the General Assembly of the Company have a vote for every thirty shares held by them up to a maximum of 100 votes. It is clear from these arrange ments that the effective control of the Company’s affairs is entirely in the hands of the Deutsche Bank group. . The following are a few of the most important features in the Convention embodying the Concession:— The Turkish Government concede to the Company (Article I) the construe- tion and exploitation of the line from Koniah to Bagdad and Bussorah via certain specitied places, and with certain branch lines, viz. : 1. From Tell-Habesh to Aleppo, so as to connect with the Syrian Railway system. 2. From some point on the main line, not specified in the Convention, north to Ourfa. 3. From Sadije (near Bagdad) to Khanikin on the Persian frontier. 4 . From Zobeir (near Bussorah) to some point on the Persian Gulf.

Cost of Construction of the Bagdad Railway. The first section of the railway, from Koniah to Eregli, was opened to traffic in October 1904, but, the distance to Eregli being only 190 kilom the line was P r0 ™ge another 10 kilom. to Bourgourlu in order to complete the statutory 200 t kilom. Untoi- tunatelv no definite information is available as to the actual expenuBuve on construction of the line, and the estimates made vary between 8 , 000 /. and 6,0 &gt; 0 /., or even less, per mile. We are inclined to think that 6,000/. per mile is probably not far from the mark, with another 1 , 000 /. per mile for rolling-stock, making 7,000/. in all. or about 875,000/. for the whole section. A further sum of 1 / 2 , 000 /. is also stated to have been spent, partly on surveys of the whole line and partly in “ faux frais” to Turkish officials. It is believed that the “backsheesh” for the whole Concession was defrayed out of the loan for this section. Consequently the total expenditure on the section probably amounted to a little over 1 , 000 , 000 /., while the loan representing the construction annuity for the section appears to have realized about 1,750,000/., besides bonds for 3,216,500 fr. (face value), wffiich were kept in reserve. There should thus have been a surplus of at least 600,000/. ^ . . The Company did not undertake the construction of the first section itseit, out handed over the task to a “ Societe pour la Construction du Chemin de Eer Konia- Eregli” founded for this purpose, and having its head-quarters at Erankfort. This Syndicate employed a firm of contractors, who undertook to complete the section for a specified sum per kilometre. Howb much per kilometre was actually paid to the contractor, and wliat Com mission the Construction Syndicate received, and how r much of the balance was distributed among the Bagdad Railway shareholders, it is impossible to lay down with precision ; but the German Ambassador has recently stated categorically to Mr. Block and others that a sum of about 600,000/. is still available from the proceeds of the last loan, and that he intends to make the financiers use it on the construction of the next section. The Company’s balance-sheet for 1904 throws no light on the surplus available, the only reserve there shown being the 4 per cent, bonds to the nominal value of 3,216,500 fr. (128,660/.) referred to above. In the V20 c.

Turning now to the question whether the line, when constructed, is likely to he worked a,t a profit or at a loss, we are met with the initial difficulty that there is but little information available as to how far the working of the first Section, which was opened to traffic in October 1904, has been a success. This section was worked urmg 190o by the Anatolian Bailway Company under an agreement by which the Bagdad Railway Company appear to have handed over to them the working expenses guarantees, minus a certain proportion retained as a kind of royalty. Under these circumstances, it is natural that the Report of the Bagdad Railway Company for 1905 should throw little light upon the cost of working, but it shows at least that the traffic was comparatively small, only 27,668 tons of goods having been carried, and the gross receipts from passengers and goods being only 323,361 fr. ( 12 , 934 /.) = 103/. per mile llns sum, however, has to be made up by the Turkish Government, on account of the working expenses guarantees for the year, to an amount equivalent to 4,500 fr per kilometre, or 288/. per mile.It is interesting to compare these figures V the Anatolian liailway in ^^’.fchehir’to Cilal!

Assuming, then, that the line is constructed on the trace as at present laid down across the desert, it seems hardly possible that the three sections from Tell-Habesh to Mosul could pay commercially, and this view is corrobo rated by the evidence of Mr. Block anct others at Constantinople, who hold that the Company will he dependent mainly on the working expenses guarantees, so far as this portion of the railway is concerned. Probably they will find no great difficulty about adiusting their expenditure to the required level, as there is not likely to be any pressing demand for a large train service on these sections of tLie line. 1 Between Mosul and Bagdad both Major M aunsell and Colonel Is ewmarch thought that the profits of the railway would he greatly increased if it could be taken via Broil, Kerkuk and Kifri on the left hank of the Tigris instead of following the right bank.

Railways m the East cost less to work than in European countries Where labour Js more costly and a higher class of service is required ; wfimveseZZ instance, that the working charges on the Anatolian Railway amounted to only 269/. per mile m 90o, and probably the service required on a great portion of the Bagdad Railway would at first, at any rate, be even less elaborate and expensive than°that on ic - aa 0 ia ii mes. It would seem, too, that in course of time a considerable por ion o ic railway will produce a profit apart from the working guarantees. t his appears especially likely to be the case in regard to the portion of the line irom Mosul to the Gulf, particularly when the branch line to Khanikin has been constructed. Also the chances of profit from the western section of the railway will be greatly increased, if and when a connection is made with the Mediterranean either via Adana and Mersina, or at Alexandretta. But these developments will he a matter oi time, and for a considerable period at any rate it seems to us safe to conclude that the Railway Company will he largely dependent upon the working expenses guarantees to be furnished by the Turkish Government. 4 .—Power of German Financiers to raise the requisite Capital, We have carefully considered the question whether German financiers will be able to find sufficient capital to take up the several Construction Annuity Eoans, if and when the Turkish Government are in a position to produce satisfactory guarantees for the service of these loans. Besides the German capital invested in the Bagdad Railway Company, there would appear to be a certain amount of capital of other nationalities. An Austrian, a Swiss, and a Belgian bank were each represented on the Board of the Railway Company in 1905 by a Director, and there was also an Italian member, representing an Italian electrical Company at Milan. There were also five Directors (out of a total of twenty-seven) who were Drench officials of the Imperial Ottoman Bank (including the representative of the Bank in Paris), together with certain other Frenchmen, such as M. Pissard, Director-General of the Ottoman Public Debt, Comte G. d’Arnoux. an ex-Director-General, and Commandant E. Berger, French Delegate on the Debt. The information supplied from His Majesty’s Embassy at Constantinople, from Mr. Block, and from Mr. Braham, the “Times” correspondent, who has made a special study of this question, is to the effect that the interest of French financiers, both in the transactions connected with the first section and in the prospects of the railway, is considerable. * There are curious discrepancies between the statistics for the trade of Bagdad and Bussorah as shown in the respective Consular Reports. The value of the imports into Bagdad, as shown in the Bagdad Consular Report, is placed at a considerably higher figure than the imports for both Bagdad and Bussorah, as shown in ihe Bussorah Report. The Bussorah figures only have been used above.f m r :\ y/ ■ 'i\ 10 „ -r, i j pnvmnn financiers interested in railway con- In 1901 a meeting of Freneh and result a definite agreement is said to struction in Turkey was held m ' 5e ' 1 . 11 '; ‘ f fl Frenc h Smyrna-Cassaba line were have been concluded, by which two ^ f of the latter Company appointed Directors of the Anatotan hne^andWo Direc^ that the were elected on the ®° ar ^ ^j^e/ao-reed to communicate freely upon matters of French and the German Syndicate, c , ment 0 f Franco-German radway mutual^ and la co.o|i.m • ^ w 1903 , Broap re P ro»aWl ia.“»ai« -.r i... cap, ,, o. i?~; tssa out at Constantinople the necessary o Company to a special Company to be Railway Concession from Thus, inllm early created for the purpose (Sir N.

Ottoman Bank as operations of French capital On a subsequent occasion (in 1906) whiai negotiations are reported to have taken place between Berlin and Paris in regard to the railway, the French Government do however appear to have intervened effectively to prevent the further participation M. Pichon also informed Sir F- Bertie, m November 1906, that the Credit Lyonnais had been prepared to find money for the railway, but that M. Clemenceau s Govern- ment. on coming into office, had prevailed on the Bank to discontinue the negotiations. Sir F. Bertie has, further, reported a conversation at the French Foreign Office with M Henry 44 Directeur des Consulats et des Affaires Commerciales, who said that no sort of negotiation between the French and German financial groups could take place without the knowledge of the French Government, who would not give their con currence without previous communication with His Majesty s Government. No doubt M. Henry’s assurance was given in all good faith, and it may be taken as tolerably certain that the principal French hanks, such as the Credit Lyonnais, will not participate further in the railway without the consent of their Government. But it may well he questioned whether the French Government can prevent the further co-operation in the railway of French financiers resident in Turkey as effectively as they can control the action of hanks such as the Credit Lyonnais. The German group may also, perhaps, obtain some support in countries less financially important, such as Holland and Belgium; but the really important question to be considered is whether they can find sufficient capital to complete the undertaking without the officially-recognized assistance of England and France. On this point Sir Edward Law and Mr. Hath Jackson were confident that in course of time the requisite German capital would be forthcoming. The latter gentleman referred in this connection to the large funds held by the German Banks. The Deutsche Bank, he said, had a capital of 9,000,000/., with a reserve fund of nearly 4,000,000/., while the resources of the Dresdner Bank ::: ' were even greater, and he added that the Deutsche Bank and the Wurtembergische Vereinsbank were both heavily interested in the Bagdad Bailway Company. He thought, therefore, that Germany would be able to complete the railway singlehanded, though the work might take from five to ten years longer than if French and British capital were to co-operate M. Auboyneau, the Paris Director of the Imperial Ottoman Bank, also informed Sir F. Bertie that, in his opinion, the Germans could complete the railway without French or English assistance, hut that it would take them from fifteen to twenty years to do so. On the other hand, Sir Henry Angst, His Majesty’s Consul-General at Zurich, in the course of a conversation at the Foreign Office in December last, expressed the opinion that German financiers would not be capable of completing the railway without outside assistance. German hankers, bethought, were already so heavily involved that there was no prospect of their venturing further singlehanded upon an enterprise of such magnitude—a view which, it should be said, is diametrically opposite to the conclusions drawn by Mr Jackson from the same facts. On the whole, we are inclined to think that Mr. Jackson’s great financial knowledge and experience entitles us to * M. Auboyneau told Sir F.

Moreover, there is a first claim up to 225,000/. per annum, on this surplus on account of a possible deficit m the Macedonian Budget, and the Powers interested in Macedonian reform might reasonably take exception to the hypothecation of any part of the surplus as a permanent annuity for raising construction loans which are not to be paid oft tor nmety^ ^ otber revenues, not now administered by the Council of the Debt, which could, if the Government desired and the Germans insisted, he devoted to kilometric guarantees. • .

The Government could also still further pledge the c ‘ A^hnam, or sheep tax, which produces 1,788,400/., of which 146,430/. is already pledged, leaving a balance of 1,641,970/. There is also the revenue from “Mines and Forests” which is looked upon as a possible resource for the railway. The proceeds of this revenue are unknown, but it is believed that they could be increased by better administration. Probably the principal source which the Germans look to eventually is the increase in the yield of the existing customs duties of 8 per cent., which will be the indirect effect of the collection by the Council of the Debt of the proposed surtax * * The Council is composed of representatives of the bondholders in En gland, France, Austria, Germany, Italy, and Turkey, together with a representative of the Galata bankers. *N r13 and there ir a t 'coMLerabTe n L 6 l fa Per r is P aid raore frequently than 8 per cent ^requisite revenue, to render ^ extorting these rlvenues'for the purpose'' o^th Ge ™ an di P&gt;omacy may succeed in our entn-e concurrence in the vilw which haf heen^^’ W6 , d&lt; f re to p,aoe on re cord creation of fresh debt, involving the ♦• exp, T! d V Mr. Block that the construction of railways, must eventually in ? further revenues for the financial crisis owing to which, in 1875, Turkey *** * ® re P etition of the uimg the twenty-three years ended in 1905 thp mi n tresh capital amounting to 33,151 000/ Thii fvn i i Govemment borrowed to meet current expenditure or to provide the cl 5 , ebt has beeu ^curred merely railways which, under the present regime cm ' '' 1 '' eee ® sa 'T tor guarantees of supporting.

In arriving at our conclusions in regard to the manner m which this country mmht advantageously co-operate in the construction and control of the Bagdad Railway we have been guided by the conviction, based on the evidence of Mr. Huth Jackson, that British investors will not place their money m an enterprise of this nature unless it is guaranteed by His Majesty's Government. If such a guarantee is considered essential, it is important that the control oi His Majesty’s Government should correspond to their responsibility. It appears to us that this control would not have been secured by the German proposals of 1903.- No guarantee on the part of His Majesty’s Government was then contemplated, and there is reason to believe that the Financial Syndicate which was to be intrusted with the “ British ” share, realizing that such a guarantee was an indis pensable inducement to the British public, did not intend to rely on British, but on foreign capital. Even if the shares had been taken up in this country, no adequate pro vision was to be made for rendering the British interest permanent, nor yet for securing a fair measure of British control; and His Majesty’s Government might have been placed eventually under the anomalous obligation to support a German railway detrimental to British interests Moreover, if a British Government guarantee had, in the course of time, been resorted to as an encouragement to British investors, His Majesty’s Government might, under the system of kilometric guarantees in force under the Bagdad Railway Convention, have been precipitating. Turkey into bank ruptcy by encouraging the construction of railways at an extravagant cost, while on the other hand they would have assumed some responsibility for her solvency. We have considered several proposals as to the manner in which British co-opera tion in the railway might be undertaken :— (a.) Sir E. Law was convinced that if this country wished to have any share in the line, the Germans should be approached before they could raise the necessary capital. If we meant to act we should act now, otherwise we should be too late. * Twenty-five per cent, of the share-capital falling to Germany ; 25 per cent, to France; 25 per cent, to England; 10 per cent, to the German Anatolian Railway; and 15 per cent, to minor nations.18 c p or preferably from some place between Bagdad at any rate of the portion from Bagdad, or pie ■' . , . ,, and Mosul to the Persian Gulf. tl e abrogation of the Article m the It would Of course be necessary to obtain^ Bagdad a pd Bussorali is existing Convention which provides that » Koniah to Bagdad. . to be worked before the completion of the line s V rna-Aidin line and its junction t0 b We also consider that tl.eamal^maUim ^ tlu^yrna with the Anatolian line “'gf PT! ^rGoyemment may take% exception to the It is not improbable that the Pi , i d receive exclusive control of tne proposal that His Majesty s Government * 1 0 ut, have a favourable sections in question; but it will, as we have area yj Western Turkey-m-As a, influence upon French railway ^tatfS t'e ^“e with the Germans the and it will leave the French byndicate tree to s oini t , |e Sy nan system. lucrative construction of the sections wes ^ o)! this country in Southern Moreover, the predominant f ! tl e French Government, to render our Mesopotamia must go far, in ttie vicu claim to construct the railway reasonatne. tlie branch line from It has been suggested that Buss,a ^“^^ing through Western Persia Kbanikin to Bagdad, in continuation , izati ‘ ol | o{ ra S tes 0 ver the wliole of the from Julfa.

The Ottoman Government has the right f “‘^“'or^s Sis 0 S ^HftheSSS ments of military posts considered necessary by the Ottoman Minister War. (h.) No section of the line between Baghdad and Basra to be worked before the completion of the line from Konia to Baghdad. 4 A loan of 54,000,000 fr. having been negotiated, work on the first section to Eregli was completed in October last. Apparently it is intended to proceed wit t Section as P soon as possible, and there is no reason ^J^lgh it rnffin be aloof the eventual completion of the line would be prevented, though it might delayed. 5. No place on the Persian Gulf is specified in the Convention as the terminus of the line, and nothing has yet been decided in this respect. Koweit Pm kasi, am Kadima have been mentioned, and of these the two former appear to be the most favourably situated. A British officer who last year reconnoitred the route the railway will follow reported that Urn Kasr was preferable to koweit, and other information tends to show that if we prevented Koweit from becoming the terminus Pm Kasr, now occupied by the Turks, would be selected. The facilities offered by the two places respectively as a terminus and for the establishment of a naval base aie described in the “Memorandum on the Persian Gulf prepared by the A aval Intelligence Department, and dated the 4th March, 1904. 6 . If we participate in the further construction of the railway, and can obtain a share equal to that of any other Power in respect of construction and management, more especially of that portion of the line extending from Baghdad to the I ersian Gulf, with a preponderating influence as regards the control of the terminus, the rail way would not, as far as can be foreseen, exercise any detrimental effect, fiom a military point of view, either on our relations with Persia or on the defence of Tndia. 7. If we do not participate in the scheme, we must expect to see a diminution in those political rights and commercial interests which we have in the past two centuries secured in the valley of the Tigris and Shatt-el-Arab, and on the Persian and Arabian shores of the Gulf.' It must also be remembered that the country between the Tigris and Euphrates was once the most fertile district in the world, and there is no reason why its former prosperity should not return. Moreover, the terminus on the Gulf, being the point of distribution and transhipment, will eventually become a great focus of trade, and therefore of great strategical value, and as it is doubtful whether Turkey will be able to give the commercial and military security which the situation will require, the duty of controlling the terminus may, of necessity, devolve in course of time on one of the other Powers. 8 . Should this control devolve on Germany, as the principal participant, she might, taking advantage of Turkey’s alleged inability to give the requisite security, and, by a skilful twisting of the conditions mentioned in ( 7 ) of paragraph 3 above, succeed in gradually converting the port into a naval base, notwithstanding promises and agreements to the contrary. We know that she cannot carry out her scheme of expansion without the possession of naval ports on her lines of communications, and at present she has none outside Europe with the exception of Kiao-chau. This disadvantage would be seriously felt by her in a war with France or England, and it would clearly be diminished by the establishment of a naval base in the Persian Gulf, although the north-western extremity of the Gulf might not be an ideal position. Such a base, com bined with the use of the railway leading to it, would furnish Germany with more rapid means of communication with her Colonies in the Pacific and East Africa, and with Kiao-chau, and would enable her to keep a fleet in eastern waters, independent of the Mediterranean route, for protecting her maritime trade and for attacking that of the enemy. Should she not enjoy the free use of the railway, the naval base would be of less value to her, but its existence would nevertheless be incompatible with our predominance in the Gulf..t *• ts^raa. - “any years would be required heir m ° ney market ’ he could not state how In?*' b^'^Mpressed^the ° o^uion^ tlrit^ all ^ n6 W better than other J-nigation would do mnr*i&gt; + • ^ 10n ^parts would uav wpII &gt;--f ™»i&gt;»~.

COLONEL N EWM AllCH said it would be very much better not to continue the Bagdad Bailway from Bagdad to the Persian Gulf, but to make use ol the river navigation instead. j n ir Eight steamers were already running regularly between Bagdad and the Gull, and the Tigris alone would be sufficient to carry many more. But the Euphrates and the Ilindieh Canal could also be used, though the Euphrates channel would have to be improved a little. If the railway reached Kerbela, there would be two very good waterways to the sea. Colonel Newmarch was asked whether he thought there would be any difficulty in making the line from the Taurus Mountains to Bagdad. He answered that would be practically no engineering difficulty whatever. Once the railway had surmounted the Taurus, the laying ol the rails would be simple. He thought, how ever, that the line should not run along the banks of the Tigris from Mosul to Bagdad, as at present proposed. It would be much more profitable, and almost as easy, to take the line from Mosul through Erbil, Kerkuk, and Khanikin to Bagdad. In this wav it would pass through many important towns instead of through the sparsely- populated valley of the Tigris, and the Persian market would be tapped without the construction of the proposed branch line from Bagdad to Khanikin. Some low hills would be met, but these offered no serious engineering difficulty. If any trouble arose in connection with the Taurus-Bagdad section ot the railway, it would be due to the tribes through whose districts the line would pass. These tribes were mostly nomad and half savage. The only effective way of securing their good conduct would be to grant them subsidies so long as the railway was undisturbed, and to stop the subsidies whenever they offered obstruction. An armed force, unless it was very large and costly, would be of no use for the permanent maintenance of order. These subsidies would have to be paid to the tribes not only while the line was being built, but for many years to come, otherwise the tribes might at any time tear up the rails, break down' the bridges, and destroy the telegraph lines. These payments to the tribes should be made through the Besident at Bagdad. Colonel Newmarch thought it would be not at {ill difficult to rouse the tribes to such action. Questions were then put to Colonel Newmarch with respect to the difficulty of laying the rails from Bagdad to the Persian Gulf.t -r “ b. the west of the Euphrates.

There was no doubt that it woukl he drained .some day, probably in the simple way proposed by sTr ki ham Willcocks. While the Tigris was sometimes shallow there was wnernimC ? water in the Euphrates^ Sir William Willcocks’ plan was to make diagonal can^in the neighbourhood oi Bagdad that would take the surplus water from'the EuphrltS into the Tigris. Both rivers would thus have an adequate supply of wafer for navigation; the Euphrates would no longer overflow its banks; and the swamns of southern Mesopotamia might then be made to disappear. When this was done the country would be a rich one. uuue cne Colonel Newmarch also pointed out that, if the railway did not stop at Bagdad it should go to Bussorah, and not to Koweit. Bussorah held the same position wttb regard to the export trade as Bagdad held with regard to the import Cade This export business was established at Bussorah, and if would be difficult to uproot it and transfer it elsewhere Besides all river steamers could come to Bussorah safely while il they had to go to Koweit, which was a seaport, they would be liable to be swamped At present, ocean-going ships of 15 feet draught could go to Bussorah. If alterations’ were made m the bar across the Shat-el-Arab, there would he no reason why much bigger ships should not go to Bussorah. It would also be cheaper to stop the railway at Bussorah than to build it right down to the Gulf. F ^ Colonel Newmarch considered that if Great Britain participated in the control of any section of the railway it should be from Mosul to Bagdad. This section mffiht pay a little—that from Urfa to Mosul would not pay commercially. But aboye alfhe recommended that this country should aim at securing the river transport from Bagdad to Bussorah. If we could not get exclusive control over the river transport we should try to secure equal rights of navigation, but he suggested that, in return for financial aid to the Railway Company, we might bargain for the carriage of passengers and merchandize in British river steamers from Bagdad to the point where it was possible to tranship them to the ocean liners. He said that the navigation of the Tigris could be much improved by training the river and cutting loops and corners, and that the course of the river would in this way, he made less tortuous. These operations could be carried out at a far [421] Cf smaller cost than that of building, the current, which dredging would not be necessary, as these works won would act as an automatic dredger. railway were built without British Finally, Colonel Newmarch said th f at p “jf BaS and Bussorah would first ^ W « Wit the ime across the «b - w ancTCo , Messrs.

SIR HENRY ANGST called at the Foreign Office on the 17th December and saw Mr. Maxwell, Mr. Tyrrell, and Mr. Parker. 1 . „ , .. He said that he did not think German financiers were capable of completing the Bagdad Railway without foreign assistance. German bankers were already so heavi y involved that, in his opinion, there was no prospect whatever of their entering upon an enterprise of this magnitude single-handed. , He said that the Bank of Switzerland was closely in touch with German houses, and that he would have every facility for finding out if there were negotiations m pro°Tess for floating a loan. In 1903 the Swiss authorities had been approached with a view to participating in the Bagdad Railway, and Germany had offered m return to support Switzerland in the negotiations which were then being carried on with Italy, and which subsequently led to the suspension of diplomatic relations. But Swiss capital was not interested to an appreciable extent in the railway. He would not fail to report if any active steps were taken by German financiers to raise a further loan. No. 3. Notes taken of Evidence given by Major Maunsell, R.A., G.M.G., late Military Attache at Constantinople, and Captain Mahon, December 19, 1906. MAJOR MAUNSELL gave a description, from the engineering point of view, of the course which the Bagdad Railway would probably follow from the Taurus Mountains to Bagdad. He said that, after traversing the Taurus Mountains and the Adana Plain, the line would come to the Amanus (Giaour Dagh) Range, from 2,000 to 3,000 feet high, which would offer some difficulty. Thence to Killis, and as far as Aleppo, construction would be comparatively easy in this district. Thus reckoning the Taurus as the second section of the railway, this third section would still have several difficulties, and its expenses would be above the normal. The whole of the Aleppo district eastward to the Euphrates, and especially round Killis and Aintab up to Marash, was very fertile and well populated. From the Euphrates to Mosul the land was not a level desert as one might imagine from the map; the country was undulating, with several rocky ridges, and a good deal of cutting would be required. Major Maunsell called attention to the fact that this country, from the Euphrates to Mosul might be made fertile by proper irrigation from the Balikh Khabur and other streams. The ruins of ancient cities with which one met showed that at one time it was well populated along the rivers, with a large nomad population besides. Between Mosul and Bagdad the line, as at present proposed, would run along the right bank of the Tigris. The chief difficulty in the construction of this part of the &lt; * -jHe had been told by many Turks that the Railway Concession purposely rel^ from nrovidinn for any proper outlet on the Mediterranean because tne imKisn Government hfd feare/thit the British and thus secure a hold over the railway. This \i J ■. whole line it Major Maunsell was strongly of opinion ^ with was necessary to have some good harboui on the .. . &gt; , v t obliges the railway. ' Even as traced at present, the approach of the hills t0 e c ^‘ the line at Missis to pass within a short distance oi the sea, an \iexandretta and interrupted by a hostile force landing at the head or the Gulf ol ^^'1 and occupying the point named. So that, in any case the hne cannot well be protected from attack by a hostile sea Power as it passes here. This disposes of the idea sometimes expressed that the German’s could ever transport their troops unmterrup , to a supposed naval fortress of theirs at the head of the bruit. The best place for this purpose was Alexandretta A small breakwater would make this place an excellent harbour for all purposes. He did not think a port on le west side of the Gulf of Alexandretta, at Ayas or Yimurtaluk would be so useiui, owing to the danger of silting up from the mouth of the large hirer -Taihim c y, and he thought it would be worth building the railway along the shore oi the Gulf and through the Bailan Pass in the Amanus, so as to make the connection with Alexandretta itself. Mersina is an open roadstead, unsuitable for a harboui. Alexandretta would become the principal port of the country lor the trade of Aleppo, Diarbekir, Ivharput, Mosul, and possibly from North-West i ersia as well. Major Maunsell was then asked what he took to be the interest of the present Sultan of Turkey in the railway. He said that beyond doubt the Sultan’s main object was to get railway com munication with Syria and the Hejaz, but a strong subsidiary object was to secure facilities for moving troops rapidly in the direction of Diarbekir and tlie Bitlis I ass to get them to the Russian frontier. Besides this, it was of course to the advantage of. the Sultan that he could move troops to Bagdad to check the growing Arab discontent in that province, or to Mosul and the Persian frontier if necessity arose. He did not think that the Sultan’s active interest in the Bagdad Railway would cease as soon as the connection was established with the Hejaz line. The question was then raised of whether the Germans could complete the Bagdad Railway without outside assistance. Major Mannsell thought that if they could obtain the kilometric guarantee, they could do so, but that in the present state of Turkish finance almost all tithes and other sources of revenue had already been used up for guarantees, and only sufficient money could be found to guarantee the Taurus section, and possibly the next after that. But it is possible that by some mysterious channel of Turkish finance that money might leak from the increase of the custom duties to serve as a guarantee for the railway. He also thought that the line, taken as a whole, would pay from the beginning. There would he a loss on the working of some sections, hut the profit on other sections would more than cover this loss. If taken on the northern trace through Diarbekir and by Kerkuk it would certainly pay all through from the beginning. The principal articles carried by the railway would be wheat, maize, cotton, millet, sesame, oakgalls, dates, wool, hides, silk, and tobacco, besides large numbers of sheep, which are driven from Mosul, Diarbekir, and even some from the Bagdad district, for sale at Aleppo and Alexandretta. He was asked whether it was not likely that most of the traffic on the part of the line still to be built would tend to find an outlet on the Persian Gulf rather than on the Bosphorus. He thought that this would depend upon whether Alexandretta was joined to the railway or not. If Alexandretta was to form an outlet on to the Mediterranean, Major Maunsell thought Mosul would he the dividing point in the traffic, with some of the more valuable traffic from Bagdad. South of Bagdad, all goods would go to the Persian Gulf ; north of Bagdad, much traffic would gravitate towards the Mediterranean, and between it and Mosul a large portion would also descend to the Gulf. All the Diarhekir, and most of the Mosul, traffic would certainly go to Alexandretta. It was true that great efforts had been made to draw traffic towards the Bosphorus, and railway rates had been arranged in such a way on the Anatolian Railway as to try to cut out Smyrna. This might be due to the fact that a large amount had been expended on the construction of the port of Haidar Pasha, and it was no doubt wished to make as much use of the port as possible. But he did not think that the Bosphorus would ever become the main outlet for the Bagdad Railway traffic.11 would be absurd, for instancrto h ° f C t ° n ?, e ? tin g Alexandretta with the railway It up to Haidar Pasha before bein° ^bfo t°c \ mg Sood S from the Aleppo distrfot riJt round by Ktllis and Kazanali woidd be foo^ar ^ t0 Mersilla or Ayas°all and goods would find their way there bv ,e V- lhe “ at,,ral outlet is Alexandretta out bythe Germans.

Notes taken of Evidence given by Mr. F. Ruth Jackson, a Director of the Bank of England, January 23, 1907. MB. JACKSON was asked whether British investors were likely to place their money in the Bagdad Bailway, relying on the merits of the undertaking as a commercial venture, and on the securities offered by the Ottoman Government and the Bailway Company, if the bonds were quoted on the London Stock Exchange without any guarantee on the part of His Majesty’s Government. He replied, without hesitation, that this was most improbable. Firstly, the suspicion of Germany was so widespread amongst all classes in this country that any participation in a German enterprise would be unpopular; secondly, there had been a marked tendency among British investors during the last twenty years to withdraw their capital from European Government securities—and practically very little interest was now taken in Ottoman, as distinguished from Egyptian, stock. The German investors, when investing money in any country, felt assured that the German Government would exercise strong pressure to safeguard their interests, and it was well known that Turkey was among sucli countries. The German and British investors were in this respect upon totally different footings, so that what might appear adequate security to the one would not necessarily do so to the other. If the negotiations of 1903 had proved successful, no large amounts would, in his opinion, have been subscribed in England. Mr. Jackson was then asked if the financial position of German financiers were sufficiently strong to enable them to complete the line single-handed without having recourse to the money markets of Paris and London. He hereupon quoted the following passage from the Report of the Deutsche Bank for 1904 :— Bo u rgourlou—was The first section of the Bagdad Bailway—from Konia to opened for traffic on the 25th October, 1904. For the present this section will be worked by the Anatolian Company, of whose system it practically forms an extension through the fertile plain of Karaman.

Colonel Pobertson thought this was perhaps the obpet which was at the back of the friendliness of Germany to the Multan. 7 _ To extend her influence through Syria to the Egyptian frontier, in order to bnvc still another means of worrying England. Colonel Pobertson thought that it would be desirable to (1) prevent Germany from netting a secure footing in the Persian Gulf, and (2) prevent her from getting anv control over the Syrian railways. Those were the two most important points to be kept in view at present ; but he admitted that he had no idea how we could attain these two objects. , /-« Coloner Pobertson was asked whether he thought it likely that many Germans would settle along the railway. He said he did not think this was at all probable. Neither did he think it would be likely that German troops would be used to guard the line in time of peace. _ . , _ , , . With reference to Germany’s designs on Persia, he was asked whether he thought it possible that Germany might join with Russia in opposing Britain in Persia and the Persian Gulf. He thouo-ht this was quite possible. It was certainly much more likely than that Germanv would join with us in opposing Russia. He did not think it w:uld be difficult for Germany and Russia to work together in Persia, It was pointed* out that, if Germany succeeded in building the railway to the Gulf then she would control the larger part of the trade of W T estern Persia. Owing to the nature of the country, it seemed certain that if Tehran was to be connected by rail to the Gulf it would be by means of a line running in the direction of Bagdad.

E f M ACKAY was asked what effect the Bagdad Railway would have upon British interests, both Imperial and Indian, if completed without British ul Oil.

U ^jnan ships were run in conjunction with the railway, they were bound in time to “““The Hamburg-Ameriean line had already begun sailings to Bussorab. There was at present no trade to speak of from Hamburg to the Gulf, and the sen ice uas manifestly worked at a dead loss. . . . , , , u , , • i , The Company would not do this without some ulterior object, and that object he held was to get themselves established in the Persian Gulf in view of the completion of the Bagdad Railway. They could not carry on the service on their own account; they must be in receipt of a Government subsidy, and it was only for some definite purpose that the German Government gave a consideration of tins nature. Sir James Mackay observed incidentally that the British India Company had maintained certain buoys in the Gulf for twenty years or so. Recently they bad been approached by the Hamburg-American line, who wished to become interested m the buoys and to pay a quota of their upkeep. The British India Company declined the offer, as they preferred not to give up their lien on the buoys, in order to amid the expense. Questioned as to the status of these buoys, feir James said that all they had was the prescriptive right acquired by long and undisturbed usage. Sir James was then asked whether he considered the river transport would compete considerably with the railway. He replied that if the line were made down to Koweit, the traffic from Bagdad, a distance of 450 miles, would undoubtedly go right down by rail. There is a large local and intermediate traffic between Bagdad and Bussorah, and this would remain on the river. But the through traffic, both up and down, and the pilgrim traffic—which would be opened up very materially when the line was built—would all go by rail, taking advantage of a punctual and relatively quick service. If wharves were built at Koweit, and ships could be brought along side, and the goods transferred direct to a railway waggon which would deliver them in Bagdad under twenty-four hours, the river traffic, especially congested as at present, would offer no serious competition. In support of this view, Sir James Mackay quoted the case of the East Indian Kailway, which had killed the river traffic of the Ganges. He considered Koweit would form the best terminus, as it was capable of being made a very fine harbour, and ships could be loaded up to 27 or 28 feet, whereas at Bussorah there was the difficulty of the bar, and ships could only be loaded up to 16 feet. Sir James then expressed the view that we should aim at getting control of the of the railway from Mosul to Koweit, or, failing that, from Bagdad to He considered that the line built in this manner would prove a o&gt;reat benefit materially increase, British trade. He considered that the Bagdad-Gulf of the line would pay as a commercial undertaking, without any kilometric guarantees, at all events when the line had been opened a few years. Wherever a railway was built in India it paid (except in the case of a few strategic lines), and even the Eganda Kailway paid a small dividend. If the Imperial Government were to guarantee 3 per cent, on the capital spent on the line, he was decidedly of opinion that the requisite capital would be forthcoming; and if the line were built on the same terms as many of the Indian lines it was improbable that the Government would be called upon to pay anything. The system he referred to was as follows: The Government guarantee 3 per cent, on the capital; they sanction all the expendi ture, and the accounts are kept in one of the Public Offices. If there is a shortage, the Government would make up the difference.

He considered that if Great Britain undertook these sections it would be politic to take them in hand from the Gulf upwards before the through line could reach Mosul, so as to establish and draw the local trade to and from the Persian Gulf instead of allowing it to gravitate towards the Mediterranean He considered that Great Britain should secure control of the Gulf sections -,,.,1 that control might best be secured by His Majesty’s Government guaranteeing a * «? ‘' ,e Konia-Bregli section, which is built for express traffic, a train has been run at 60 miles an exceed 20 ^ 00 “ st '' u '' tloI ‘ 18 ma '‘ tamed ’ '’ ere seen,s 110 why the speed should notcertain rate of interest, in return for which their nominees would preponderate on the Board of Management of this section. . . . p ,i -o • r Sir George wished to emphasize the importance of the terminus of the section being carried to a point north of Bagdad—Mosul being a suitable one-so that it might, when required, control and dominate the branch line certain, m t le Eu me, to be constructed between Bagdad and Tehran. The Russian lines, completed as they now are up to the Persian frontier at Julfa and Sarakhs, would sooner or later be extended to Tehran, when the main Bagdad Railway, through the Bagdad ehian branch, would obtain communication Avith the northern proAunces of 1 ersia and Central Asia. . , i x-i i j As to the business prospects of the line, he said that these must gieatry depend upon the cost of construction (8,000/. seemed an outside figure)^and upon the ^S 11 ' ment of the line ; but, keeping in Anew wdiat has resulted on the Uganda Railways and other lines in India, Canada, and elseAA r here, he anticipated that Y\ithin a icasonable period the line would be self-supporting, and provide its shareholders with a moderate rate of interest. He was of opinion that the financial liability of IBs Majesty s Govern ment would prove less under a moderate guarantee—which might well be partially borne by the Indian Treasury—rather than by the purchase of a commanding block of shares which would involve the lock-up of a considerable capital sum without providing inducement to financial institutions in England to support the scheme. Sir George considered that His Majesty’s Government should accept the kilometric guarantee offered by the Turkish Government. As to revenue for reduction of the guaranteed interest, this might well be obtained on the Koweit-Mosul section by stipulating for the hypothecation to the railway of the new customs revenue obtained from the increased and extended grain cultivation and export. The inci^eased revenue collected on fresh tracts of land on either side of the line, brought under cultivation for specific crops, might also be allocated for this purpose. He anticipated that, as in Egypt, vast tracts of present waste lands would immediately become valuable, as also would the land at the terminal port in the Persian Gulf. If proAnsion were made for the hypothecation of these lands there would be undoubted security to recoup the guaranteed interest paid out in connection with the Mosul-Koweit section of the line. As an illustration of the progress recently made in the trade of Mesopotamia, Sir George stated that in 1870, on the opening of the Suez Canal, only one steamer from Europe visited Bussorah. Tons. In 1885 the steamer tonnage visiting Bnssorah rose to .. 67,658 .. 167,220 .. 182,180 7.260 In ls95 In 1905 „ ,, „ While in 1905 the non-British tonnage only totalled The first box of dates was shipped from Bussorah in 1877. In 1906 the export of dates was valued at 400,000/. If railway facilities AA^ere available, trade would undoubtedly be developed still more rapidly. He considered that Koweit would certainly be a better terminus than Bussorah, and it would be well worth while to construct the extra 100 miles of railway. KoAveit was a good port, and capable of being developed into an excellent harbour. There Avas, moreover, no bar as in the case of Bussorah. No. 8.

Sir 7 o 1 J 1 HAYE tke honour to acknowledge the receipt of your telegram ^Secret ) 1 of ^he 3rd January, asking me for observations as to the effect of the Bagdad itailwav if [4*2!] ° p Fcompleted without our participation, upon British interests in Bussorah and Bagdad, Mohammerah, Persia, and the Persian Gulf. The following points occur to me :— Bussorah and. Ba^.-Exports ^toLTt constitute the chief foreign features of Turkish Arabian uaue Kurdistan^nd Western ^Persia!' 'Ifa'gdad has 'a' decided mercantile predominance over Bussorah whth apart from the date and grain export trade is merely the ocean port of Ban-dad Ocean traffic ceases at Bussorah, and river traffic ceases to be profitable above'Wdad All commerce to the east, north, and west of Bagdad is conducted by caravan The value of imports bv sea to Bussorah, including Bagdad, which was approximate V 511,0001. in 1887, lose in 1905 to 1 , 3 S 7 , 000 Z showing an increase o S i 000,0001. in eighteen years. The value of exports during the same period increased from 974,0001. to 1,515,0001., or about 500,0001. Of 102 steamers cleared at the port of Bussorah in 1888, 101 were British, with _ an aggregate tonnage of 103,290 tons. Of 169 cleared in 1905,163 were British, with an aggregate tonnage of T. 180 tons ’ British commercial interests in Turkish Arabia predominate over those of every other European country, and are as follows : 1. 96 per cent, of the shipping of the port of Bussorah 2 . A very large proportion of the export trade, which is carried either direct to the United Kingdom or to other countries in British ships. „ , T , 3 . About 60 per cent, of the imports, consisting chiefly of British, Indian, and Colonial manufactured goods and products. . , 4 . The annual pilgrimage of British subjects and British protected subjects to the Shia shrines. The number of passengers from India and Europe, chiefly pilgrims, who passed through the Lazaretto in 1905 was 11,535. 5 . About one-fourth of the river transport from Bussorah to Bagdad and vice versd, as represented by the two steamers of the Tigris and Euphrates Steam Navigation Company (agents, Messrs. Lynch Brothers). In view of nresent disabilities, such as the bar difficulty, the impediments to river navigation and what is practically a Turkish river monopoly, British import trade both to the internal towns of Turkey and in transit to Persia would, I think, if assured of commercial fair play, benefit by the Bagdad Railway and expand, whether we participate in its construction or not. But as the line starts from Constantinople, and connects there with the Central and Eastern European railway systems, it will undoubtedly favour the trade of Eastern and Central Europe, and react to our prejudice in those directions. To enable us, therefore, to hold our own with advantage against the competition of land-borne traffic, we require increased facilities for our water-borne trade, such as the removal or mitigation of some of the disabilities which now hamper it. If this were done the Bagdad Railway would I think, to some extent, benefit our trade inland from the Persian Gulf and aid its development. A terminus, accessible to ocean steamers, would remove the congestion, which occurs annually when the river falls, and obviate the obstruction of the bar at the estuary of Shatt-ul-Arab, which now strangles our trade at the neck. The line would of course serve to develop new areas of cultivation, and our water-borne trade, now artificially cramped and confined, would, unless repulsed by some undue preferential treatment of our rivals, or otherwise interfered with, take its share of the returning prosperity of the country. Composition between the rail and river transport would undoubtedly have the effect of lowering freight rates from Bussorah to Bagdad and vice versd, which aie now exorbitant, hut as the German Company by Article 9 of their Concession obtains navigating rights on the river during the construction of the line, it seems improbable that, after acquiring the necessary plant and establishing wharves and warehouses at Bagdad and Bussorah, it will relinquish entirely the advantages of navigation. It may thus acquire complete con+rol of the traffic by w r ater as w r ell as by land, and in that case the present British interest in the carrying trade of the river, which does not exceed one-fourth of the w r hole, w’ould not appear to have much prospect of further development. The Germans no doubt calculate, not only that new trade will be developed, but that the course of present trade wfill be altered. It is expected that British vesselsfrom Bagdad to Bussorali and the Persian Gulf, as well as the branch hoe to Khanikm ° n 'ddie^other 1 polrd^mentioned are beyond my province, and X feel very incompetent i0G ^Z:Zt^Z?e^As regards Mohammerah and ^ the Karim is, of course, the chief base of operations for the future develop e trade routes from the South of l^ersia, whether the line taken is Shuster Khoremabad and Burujird, connecting through Sultanabad with camagc ^ad between Kum and Tehran, or whether traffic follows the Lynch road acioss tl e Bakhtiari Mountains to Isfahan. The difficulties attending animal transport m Persia are onlv too well known, and although the Ahwaz-Isfahan loute is 2o- mi shorter than that from Bushire to Isfahan, the road in either case crosses mountains of great altitude, and there are always the same road obstacles for heavily loaded mules. Under these circumstances it seems probable that the opening o le Bagdad Bailway, with a terminus on the Persian Gulf, and a branch line from Bagdad to Rhanikin, will cause a deflection in sea-borne imports from the Karan route to that via Bagdad and Khanikin, where they will have easier and more rapid access to the northern and central Persian markets. As the line will be connected with Eastern and Central Europe, Khanikin will be brought into touch with other centres o. trade, and the result may well be that Isfahan and Northern Persia ay ill ultimately be supplied with continental goods at less cost than that at which sea-borne Biitish goods are noiA 7 imported. In other words, the Bagdad Railway may close the Karan route for foreign imports, in so far as Northern and Central Persia are concerned. Anything which tends to emancipate trade from the intense conservatism of the Persian muleteer, who now controls the carrying trade of the country, must be to the general advantage, and although a railway as far as Khanikin would not enable us to dispense Avith mule transport for our imports beyond that point, there \AOuld be a considerable saving of time and distance, which should to some extent compensate us for the closing of other routes to imported trade. The export of wheat in good seasons Avas an important feature in the estimate of future traffic on the Karun River, and I do not think the Bagdad Bail way will adversely affect the development of a region which is justly 7 considered capable of becoming one of the granaries of the world. If the German Company, by virtue of the powers conferred on it by Article ^3 of the Concession, undertakes the dredging of the bar at the estuary of the Shatt-ul- Arab, which I fear is not likely, the grain export trade of the Karun will derive considerable benefit from the operation. British trade Avith Persia by the Khanikin route, which is now estimated roughly at three-quarters of a million, would surely benefit by the construction of the railway, unless, indeed, our trade were subjected to differential treatment, which it should be in our power to prevent. The Khanikin branch will collect the great passenger traffic of the Shiite pilgrims Avho visit the sacred shrines at Kerbela and Nedjef. Persian Gulf .—In the Persian Gulf the following points appear to me to affect British interests :— [a.) The choice of a terminus. (b.) The transmission of mails to India by the Bagdad Railway. (c.) The potential dangers in a trans-continental highway towards India. {d.) The stipulation in the Concession regarding the delay in constructing the Gulf section until the Constantinople-Bagdad sections are completed, which operates clearly in restraint of British trade. It was stated in 190*2 that “ we sought no material advantages for ourselves in the Persian Gulf, beyond those which British trade and shipping could reap from the freedom and security of commerce and navigation in open competition with the rest of the world.” The advantages of our position enabled us to make this assumption, but it is an open question whether we shall hold the same view when the Bagdad Railway reaches its terminus on the Gulf. The German fleet will then have been doubled, and we shall be face to face with a great military and naval Power, advantageouslv based on a railway ten days from Berlin and four from Bombay. Commercially we may have to compete with a German coasting service, drawing coal and supplies from the railway terminus, and able, through preferential treatment for German land-borne manu factures, to displace us in the Gulf markets. Our interests, political and commercial alike, render unwise the surrender of our pre-eminence m the Persian Gulf.23 being within our spLre or influMcTti apV ^ a to . me to ^e the most suitable spot as ascendency there when Tt 1 has ^ecome^he mtT “Z T, shal1 ^ntinuetotr^ur to conjecture.

(5.) It appears to me essential to British commercial interests that ( 1 ) the rally ay should be continued from Bagdad to Khanikin, so that our trade may compete on favourable terms with the Bussian trade in the north-west of Persia, which is the chief market for goods imported into Bagdad, and ( 2 ) that either the railway should be continued from Bagdad to the Persian Gulf, or that the Tigris and Euphrates should be open commercial routes. With the railway opened as far as Bagdad only, and the river traffic a monopoly (for Eynch’s steamers can carry only a fraction of the present trade), we might find ourselves in the awkward position that it would cost more to transport goods by sea to Bussorah, and thence to Bagdad, than to import them to Bagdad by rail. Should such a state of affairs exist, our trade from the south would be materially hampered, and any diminution of trade with Bussorah, or the port which replaces it, would probably have a bad effect on our carrying trade in the Persian Gulf generally—ships with cargo for the Persian Gulf ports might find it difficult to get full loads, if the trade with Mesopotamia was reduced. Any obstacles in the way of trade from the south would most seriously effect Indian trade, which could take no advantage of improved means of communication from the north. If the railway is made without British participation, the extensions to the south and east of Bagdad may long remain uncompleted, and it is only these portions of the line which will serve British interests. 5. Briefly stated, my opinion is that the political effect of a railway made without British participation will be fatal to British interests and influence in Mesopotamia, and that the effect of such a railway on British commercial interests may be very serious unless the Euphrates and Tigris are open to trade with such rates of freight as may be settled by open competition. With the rivers closed, Biitish trade might be made to pay under the guise of freight, a considerable share of the guarantee given * by the Turkish Government to the Bagdad Railway Company.

A less favourable aspect of the question, as regards mainly gyp * won , however, present itself should the Mediterranean be ever brought into railway connection with the Persian Gulf. A great part ^ of the traffic would then revert to its old route across Mesopotamia, a deviation which would afiect not only the buez Canal as the passage, but Aden as the emporium of the Indo-European trade, it behoves us, therefore, to be on the alert lest such a railway falls into not altogether friendly hands. I would venture to lay in this _ connection tlm utmost stress on the necessity of Englishmen obtaining, conjointly with Erenchmen, if needs be, such a concession. The most feasible and beneficial project would doubtless be a line from Alexandretta by Aleppo, Meskineh, and Bagdad to Koweit. It would present no great engineering difficulties, and would require no kilometric guarantee. As British subjects I understand were the first applicants for such a railway, Article Nil of the Turco-German Convention, granting to the Anatolian Company a preferential claim to construct any branch between Mersina and Tripoli, could I think be disputed and set aside as inadmissible. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) H. Z. LONGWOETH. ii No. 10. Memorandum by Mr. Parker respecting certain aspects of the Financial Situation in regard to the Bagdad Railway. ON arrival at Constantinople, I found that the inquiries I had to make, respecting the ability of the Ottoman Government to afford the necessary guarantees for the continuation of the Bagdad Bnilway, bad been largely anticipated in a Beport just drawn up by Mr. Block for his Syndicate in London. The conclusions arrived at in this Beport (which Sir N. O’Conor has sent home in a despatch dated the 20th Eebruary) are :— 1. That the external debt of Turkey has increased so rapidly that it is imprudent, alike in the interests of the Turkish Government and in those of the original foreign bondholders, to raise further external loans or to pledge more revenues as kilometric guarantees, when they should rather be applied to administrative reform; and 2. That the German authorities, in spite of this view, which they do not entirely share, are determined to proceed with the construction of the next section of the railway across the Taurus at an early date, and that they wall insist, in virtue of the Convention of 1903, upon securing guarantees which the Porte can and will provide, possibly by starving the Administration.27 With him upon tUs and^n^a.^oof 1 ^ SeVeral “'^rsations jEatfteta-jss - f~ ysaxae .i: • n,l »itu ,,ert,i„ ommionJ,,,,* Zi in “°““*S “J”” W06-UOI, himself and ins French colleague both hf “f P 1 ®* 6 divergence of view lietween derived by extending the origin] fnncdions^f H P adva f ta f s wlli oh have been railway construction has been ^ ^ 1 th , e Counci1 oi the Debt, whereby upon the financial prosperity of the country 1U re ” ard to tlle e ^ eet °f such construction This information all bears nrpttv nincra it is necessary to summarize it and'to aT” * f • B f gdai ? llail way question, and before coming to the main object we he'd • y bnef , review of 'J'urkish finance, British co-operation being decided unou « na ^ el . v ’ ’whetlier, in the event of could be devised for making reforms^!

The Council of the Debt has increased the yield of the revenues which it administers, but it has also served indirectly to encourage the Porte, by affordino’ more reliable security to financiers, to incur fresh debt merely to meet current expenditure or to provide the capital necessary for guarantees of railways, which, under the present regime, can never, Mr. Block contends, be self-supporting.' Thus, while in 1886 the revenue of the Empire was estimated at 15,257,000/. and the proportion of the external debt charges thereto was 16'86 per cent., in 1906, although the revenue was estimated to have risen to 20,529,000/., the proportion of debt charges was 27T2 per cent. In including the charges for kilometric guarantees in external debt, Mr. Block inclines to the view that the working of railways is not likely to lead, for the present, to such an improvement in the taxable capacity of the country as to com pensate the revenue for the sacrifices made in the torm of kilometric guarantees. He considers that the amount paid annually by the State for this pur pose' shows no signs of substantial diminution. The gross receipts of the Itailway Companies enjoying kilometric guarantees were, in 1906, only some 10,800/. above those for 1905: while [421] tt Mr. Block Special Report (Extract), October 1905. Has regards the actual guarantees, the Government paid only 3,100/. less m 19^^ than in the preceding year. In view of these results i. oc ' Up holds that there in question cannot be looked upon as a commercia success, ^ q personal is no prospect of their becoming so, as long as commerce is liberty interfered with by puerile police measures, am v 11 e i • p * s phelv to irrigation, and harbour works are neglected, a state of affai continue during the present reign. rmv&gt;ppdincr The German authorities do not admit that there are valid objections to proceedm b with the next section of the railway. r ril rn Thev argue that thev are bound in the very interests oi the Turkish l icasuiy to link up communication with the sea by way of Adana and Mersma and thus to me, ease the gross receipts of the Konia-Eregli section, and perhaps of the Anatolian sy ^ They lav stress on the increase of tithes which, partly owing to better collect , chiefly owing to the railways, has already taken place m the districts served ; an m this view they are strongly supported by the Trench Delegate on the Counci o Debt, who, in a note dated the 20th May, 1904, testifies that “ le Gouvernement Imperial a obtenu une augmentation certame de la capacite contnbutive des provinces traversdes par les voies nouvelles.” ^ o ,, If, however, railway construction should result m the embarrassment ot the Ottoman exchequer, there is reason to believe that the Germans would favour ic extension of the administration of the Council of the Debt over more publid revenues as the obvious solution, and the German Ambassador has indeed informed Mi. Block that he looks forward to this institution assuming by degrees a far more comprehensive partin the control of Turkish finance. Whether such a consummation would be m the interests of the original bondholders appears to be subject to doubt. But whatever may be the ultimate effect upon the financial position of Turkey, the German Ambassador has recently informed Mr. Block that he is determined to proceed with the next section. He has also told the “Times” correspondent—a persona grata at the German Embassy—and Colonel Picot that he looks upon himself “ as in honour bound to the Turkish Government” to see the difficult section built, and the line linked up with the sea, and that he will compel the persons concerned to devote the surplus (600,000/.) on the last section to the one to come. The German Government have recently obliged the Porte to reserve the surplus of the ceded revenues (estimated, after deduction of permanent charges of 125,000/., at 200,000/.) as security for construction loans for the Bagdad Bailway. There is another source available as security for construction of the line. The German “ Tisheries Loan ” has revenues which give on an average 54,000/. more than is required for the service of the loan. The German Ambassador hopes that the indirect effect of the Council of the Debt collecting the 3 per cent, customs surtax will be to increase the yield of the existing duties of 8 per cent. At present 6 per cent, is paid more frequently than 8 per cent., so great is the corruption of the officials. This increase, it is hoped, will provide a further security for railway construction, and the revenue from “Mines and Forests” is looked upon as another possible resource. There is a tacit agreement between the State and all railways enjoying kilometric guarantees that the surplus of tithes assigned to one line may be devoted to a deficit in the tithes assigned to another. The working expenses guarantees lor the Konia-Eregli and Eregli-Adana sections nan thus be provided from the surplus of the tithes allocated to the guarantees of the Anatolian line. In 1905-1906 the Konia-Eregli section required for the working expenses 25,000/.—the maximum amount which can be claimed is 36,000/.—but it is not con sidered probable that this maximum will be required. The annual average 1 surplus of the tithes allocated to the Anatolian Railway is, for the last nine years, 62,000/. If, therefore, it is assumed that the maximum guarantee for the two sections of the Bagdad line will be required, a further sum of only 10,000/. will be necessary. Mr. Block is strongly of opinion that if Great Britain participates in the Bagdad Railway, together with France, Russia, and Germany, she should urge upon the other Powers the need for collective action in order to make Turkey adopt more orderly methods of finance. He refers particularly to the habit of paying the interest on past loans by incuring fresh ones, and to extravagance in administration.29 Mr.BbckTgrees 'b ^ 88 °ii U&lt; ; h fomentations, relax those police measures whichaet as a barrier to o° m * duCe the present Sultan to but he does hold that the continual pressure of fh S p eatei ' c ? mmercial prosperity, is likely to have a considerable effect upon the Otfon °' p S 111 favour of economy has theHctive'Vupporrof BaSn 1 partici P atio11 in^heXSwa^d 1 !! it rece f ^ ~ Cfe of - consideration 1 ^ ^ take, SSd h^^e^a^ ^s^ctt^ui correspondent who hts made’a Mr ‘ Braha “- the “Times” with Colonel Picot.

Ten per cent, of this sum was allotted to the Ottoman overnment, and a certain number of shares are known to have been purchased for the Sultan by the Ottoman Bank. The loan for the first section was negotiated by a Syndicate of Bankers. The nominal amount was 54,000,000 fr. The issue price of each of these successive loans * ^ onve ntion at not less than 81 per cent. It was issued to the public at »b’40 per cent., and the margin represents the profit made by the Banking Syndicate, who handed over to the Bagdad Bailway Company 81 per cent, of 54,000,000 fr. i 6 ^ &gt; P 3n y not arrange for the construction itself, but handed over the task to a “ Societe pour la construction du Chemin de Eer Konia-Eregli,” founded for this special purpose and having its head-quarters at Frankfurt. This Syndicate did not build the line, but acted as agent between the Company and contractors, who undertook to complete the section for a specified sum per kilometre. How much per kilometre was actually paid to the contractor, and what commission the Construction Syndicate received, and how much of the balance w T as distributed to the Bagdad Bailway shareholders in the form of a bonus, it is impossible to lay down with precision; but Baron Marschall has stated recently that a sum of 600,000/. is still available from the proceeds of the last loan for application towards the next section. ; Tiie interest of French financiers in these transactions and in the present welfare ol the Bagdad line is known to be considerable, If possible, Mr. Braham is going to ascertain the extent of this interest. It appears to be the view r of all those whom I saw, that so long as M. Constans remains French Ambassador at Constantinople, French financiers of Levantine extraction, such as MM. Auboyneau, Pangiris, Yitalis, and Vandeuvre, will not be convinced of the determination of the French Government to prevent the employment of further French capital in promotion of the Bagdad Bailway.« -n i a finfinoiers interested m ]u ]901 a meeting of irene i ^ As a resu lt, a definite agreement was construction m Turkey was lield in Fre h Smvrna-Cassaba line were appointed arrived at, whereby two Dnectors ot 11,e of the lattel .

Auboyneau had been asked to go to Berlin to consult about the Bagdad Railway. There he bad met M. Zander, who had proposed to him that the French group should participate in the Bagdad Railway by linking up the Syrian lines with it. The Germans were prepared to make the next section themselves, and the idea was that the Syrian Railway should be extended to meet the extension of the Bagdad Railway, and that the whole should then form one business. M. Auboyneau had replied that the French group could not participate unless an English group also joined in. M. Zander had said there would be considerable difficulty with public opinion in Germany about accepting the co-operation of an English group. In fact, if an English group was admitted, Germany would find herself in a minority, being in the position of 1 to 2 . M. Auboyneau had suggested that the balance might be redressed by bringing in a fourth group. But M. Zander had replied that this might make matters still worse. Unless Germany was quite sure of the fourth group, she might find herself in the position of 1. to 3. On M. Auboyneau’s return to Paris, M. Zander had followed him there: a fact which appeared to M. Gambon to show that the Germans could not find the necessary money themselves, and were very anxious for French participation. He desired to know my opinion. I said that Count Metternich had not mentioned the Bagdad Railway to me, but that in talking to others whom he met, and amongst them quite recently the Prime Minister, he had quoted our opposition to the Bagdad Railway as an instance of British hostility to Germany. As soon as Count Metternich returned, I proposed to tell him that I had heard of this, and to say to him that, naturally, we could not look favourably upon the creation of what might be an alternative through route to the East in the control of which we had no share. 1 would also tell him that, if Germany felt our opposition to the Bagdad Railway to be a political difficulty, it was for her to make proposals with regard to it, as our opposition was not irreconcilable. I also told M. Gambon that, though the Bagdad Railway form no part of our negotiations with Russia about Persia, yet it had appeared incidentally in the course of these negotiations, which had lately been making progress, that Russia had ceased to regard the Bagdad Railway as something to be opposed at all costs, and was willing to come to an arrangement with Germany about it. Indeed, she^ felt that no settlement with regard to Persia would be complete from her point of view unless she had some such arrangement M. Gambon said he would report to his Government that, in his opinion, the steps taken by M. Zander clearly showed a desire for co-operation, and that in the meantime the proper attitude was one of expectation and waiting. _ He would also report what Count Metternich’s attitude had been, and what my intention was as to speaking to him.

Count Benckendorff admitted the point, and said that, owing to the situation of Tehran, he did not see how it could he otherwise than m the Russian sphere. I said that, of course, I saw the difficulty. But none the less, it was a considera tion to he home m mind. This was not, however, the vital point to which I wished to refer. I then explained that, in consequence of our oh ligations to Afghanistan with regard to frontier matters, and to Persia under our Treaty of 1857 with regard to the Perso-Afghan frontier, it was impossible, without great complications, to place a piece of the Perso-Afghan frontier within the Russian sphere. To do so would also complicate arrangements for direct communication with Afghan officials on local frontier matters. It might he that Customs officials, ot doctors, or persons of that kind, would have to he placed by the Russians in their own sphere ; and if such persons appeared on the Perso-Afghan frontier, our difficulties would he greatly increased. Therefore, it was vital that the Russian line should start, not from Kushan, hut from Zulficar, and so avoid bringing any part of the Perso-Afghan frontier into the Russian sphere. Count Benckendorff did not seem to anticipate that there would he difficulty about this, and. appeared relieved that this should he the main point to which. I attached capital importance. I also explained what we should have to propose with regard to Customs officials separate note, provided it was done simultaneously with the main Agreement. Count Benckendorff saw no difficulty on either of these points. He said M. Isvolsky thought it might he necessary to take measures on the northern frontier of Persia to prevent revolutionaries crossing from the Caucasus ; hut he was determined to keep us informed of anything that was done, and to act in concert with us. Count Benckendorff spoke most warmly of the co-operation between us which had existed lately, and of the advantage of continuing it. I cordially agreed, and observed that co-operation had only been arranged just in time, for had it not been arranged before the recent disturbances in Persia began there would have been trouble. At one time we might have increased our prestige enormously by becoming the champions of the popular party, and great self-restraint had been necessary on our part to prevent this being thrust upon us. As to interference now, 1 understood that the Shah might desire foreign help against his own people, but such intervention from outside would be dangerous. To this Count Benckendorff entirely assented. This part of our conversation ended without the expectation^ on either side that there would be any difficulty in coming to a settlement on the Persian question. in our sphere if Russia had to foreclose the security for her loans. With regard to the Meshed-Seistan telegraph-line, I agreed that the transfer might be dealt with in a [2404 y- 1 ]Count Benckendorff then referred to Afghanistan. -pq • i ' I exp a ned the impossibility of our making any proposals about frontier officials and local communications till we had sounded the Ameer, who would naturally be very Count Benckendorff referred to the Russian apprehension ol any change in the status of Afghanistan. The Russians were afraid that an Afghan army, commanded and trained by British officers, would be a danger. They were, therefore, very anxious that we should undertake some engagement on the subject. . . I told him that I could without reserve assure him that we had no intention or desire of penetrating into Afghanistan, or changing its present status. We did not intend to send British officers into Afghanistan, nor had the Ameer asked for any. During his visit to India we had made no political proposals to him, and he had made none to us. The object of the visit, so far as we were concerned, was to prove to the Ameer that we were very good friends to him, but friends who asked nothing from him, and that he had not been asked to India in order that we might make demands upon him. , „ , , , But I foresaw that it would be very difficult for us to undeitake an) engagements about Afghanistan. There were very turbulent tribes on our own fiontiers, such as the Afridis and Waziris. There would probably be no trouble under the present Ameer, but it was always possible that some Ameer less wise might stir up the frontier tribes within our own borders, and assume an aggressive attitude which would S \&gt; &gt; require measures on our part. ••J Count Benckendorff admitted the force of this, and said perhaps some form of words might be devised by which we should engage not to do anything unless the Ameer took action which rendered measures necessary on our part. But the suggestion was very vague, and I did not think it desirable to pursue the point any further. Count Benckendorff admitted that the Ameer could not be prevented from taking measures of his own to develop his country. He was aware of our general ideas about Afghanistan on other matters, and seemed sanguine of an agreement. We then spoke of the Bagdad Railway. . I explained that Count Metternich had complained to others, though not to me, I that our attitude towards the railway was an obstacle to good relations. I therefore intended to say to him that I thought it was not fair to make a grievance of our opposition to the Bagdad Railway, while Germany refrained from making any proposals to us with regard to it. Count Benckendorff asked me whether we would initiate any proposal, and I said, &lt;£ No.” I meant to confine my statement to the point that, if Germany felt the Bagdad Railway to be a political difficulty, it was for her to make a proposal. Count Benckendorff said that M. Isvolsky’s attitude was that he would prefer that the railway should not be made. But if it was to be made, the situation must be accepted, and the best terms must be made. I told him I thought the railway would be made in the long run. If it became a through route from sea to sea, it was obvious that all the Powers—Russia, France, and ourselves, as well as Germany—would be affected by it, and would be concerned in it. If, therefore, Germany made any proposal, I would say that I thought it should include an arrangement with Russia. But I assumed that the German Government were already aware of M. Isvolsky’s views. Count Benckendorff further said that he hoped we would co-operate in the Balkans. _ The Russian Government had, after some difficulty, accepted the principle that judicial reform should be worked out through the Financial Commission. I said we had_ but one end in view, and that was to promote a better state of things in Macedonia. The situation was becoming difficult here, because the Balkan Committee, who were not Chauvinists, but quite the contrary, were pointing out that things in Macedonia were getting no better. I was afraid this was true. We ought, therefore, to work together this year, and try to make things better than last year. I also said that, to be quite frank, it was our impression that the Civil Agents of Russia and Austria had not, last year, used their influence as they might in improving matters. Count Benckendorff seemed to be fully aware of this opinion, and he did not demur to it. I told him that, as soon as the Customs question was settled, I hoped effective reforms would be proposed. We would be very glad to support them. In the course of this conversation Count Benckendorff emphasized M. Isvolsky’s desire to extend the scope of an agreement with Japan so as to produce something.Japan. The direct obiect of a settlempit W .-,ood lelatnjns between Russia and the Indian frontier.

He had been informedV^he kite Government that England had no interest in the Bagdad Railway except to see that no fortified port was made on the Persian Gulf. A proposal for co-operation had aftel- wards been dropped though Mr. Balfour had been strongly in favour of it Count Metternich thought the apprehensions expressed in the House of Commons and in the of Germany 683101 t0 tte Bagdad Rallwa 7 wer e simply due to the suspicion and distrust I observed that, if the railway became an alternative route to the Far East ooiim from sea to sea, it could not be a purely commercial enterprise. It must have political consequences, which, would affect more or less every Power interested in the region. Count Metternich was unable to see that it could have any political aspect or strategic importance, so far as we were concerned. 1 maintained the opinion that the change made by so great an enterprise must bo a matter ot interest to neighbouring Powers. Count Metternich finally said that he doubted whether this would be a good time for Germany to propose anything. She had now made further progress with the railway. He did not think any proposal which it would be seemly for her to make with the strong position she now had in the matter would meet the views expressed over here, and she could never consent, after having made so much progress with the enterprise by herself, to be deprived of any part of it. I said I was not aware that, in any quarter, deprivation had been suggested. Participation was not the same thing as deprivation. Count Metternich went on to say that he saw our negotiations with Russia were progressing favourably. I told him it was true they had been more active just lately ; but they were concerned with the Indian frontier, and the scope of them could not be said to affect German interests in any way. I hoped, therefore, he would understand that they were not in any way directed against Germany. He said that, much more important than the question of The Hague Conference or anything else with regard to relations between England and Germany, was the Anglo- French entente, and the question of whether it would be developed in a sense adverse to Germany. I replied that, in this, everything depended on whether the action of Germany was -such as to put England and France on the defensive. I am, &amp;c. (Signed) EDWARD GREY.

I helieve that these reports will he of service to the Inter-departmental Committee now considering this question, and I would also call attention to a previous despatch from Major Ramsay, forwarded in Mr. Barclay’s despatch No. 661 of the 27th September. I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your telegram (Secret) of the 3rd January, asking me for observations as to the effect of the Bagdad Railway, if completed without our participation, upon British interests in Bussorah and Bagdad, Mohammerah, Persia, and the Persian Gulf. The following points occur to me :— Bussorah and Bagdad .—Exports by sea and, in a lesser degree, imports by sea constitute the chief foreign features of Turkish Arabian trade. British trade at Bussorah is chiefly concerned with exports, while Bagdad, where British firms are mainly engaged in the import trade, is the principal centre for the distribution of cotton piece goods, its commercial influence extending to Mosul and Aleppo, Kurdistan and Western Persia. Bagdad has a decided mercantile predominance over Bussorah, which, apart from the date and grain export trade, is merely the ocean port of Bagdad. Ocean traffic ceases at Bussorah, and river traffic ceases to be profitable above Bagdad. All commerce to the east, north, and west of Bagdad is-conducted by caravan. The value of imports by sea to Bussorah, including Bagdad, which was approximately 511,000/. in 1887, rose in 1905 to 1,387,000/., showing an increase of nearly 1,000,000/. in eighteen years. The value of exports during the same period increased from 974,000/. to 1,515,000/., or about 500,000/. Of 102 steamers cleared at the port of Bussorah in 1888, 101 were British, with an aggregate tonnage of 103,296 tons. Of 169 cleared in 1905,163 were British, with an aggregate tonnage of 182,180 tons. British commercial interests in Turkish Arabia predominate over those of every other European country, and are as follows :— 1. 96 per cent, of the shipping of the port of Bussorah. 2 . A very large proportion of the export trade, which is carried either direct to the United Kingdom or to other countries in British ships. 3. About 60 per cent, of the imports, consisting chiefly of British, Indian, and Colonial manufactured goods and products. 4.

[329] Beers^ a^re^esente^by^ttie^wo steamers^'the'ri^is^nd'Eu^ratra ^ea^Nav'igatioii TJCIdtb, CK&amp; ^j ' v Company (agents, Messrs. Lynch Brothers). In view of present disabilities navigation and what ^ Poetically s Turkish river X think, if assured of to the internal towns of Turkey -nd m trausit to J^wo ^ commercial fair play, e ^ || ne starts from Constantinople, and. connects^there 8 w^i^^^^entral and Eastern European railway systems it will undouhtedlv favour the trade of Eastern and Central Europe, and react to our meiudicein those directions. To enable us, therefore, to hold our own with advantage Tains the competition of land-borne traffic, we require increased facilities for our water borne trade, such as the removal or mitigation of some of the disabilities which now hamper it. If this were done the Bagdad Bail way would I think, to some extent benefit our trade inland from the Persian Gulf and aid its development. A terminus, accessible to ocean steamers, would remove the congestion which occurs anmiallv when the river falls, and obviate the obstruction of the bar at the estuary of Shatt-ul-Arab, which now strangles our trade at the neck The line would of course serve to develop new areas of cultivation, and our water-borne trade, now artificially cramped and confined, would, unless repulsed by some undue preferential treatment of our rivals, or otherwise interfered with, take its share of the returning prosperity of the countrv. Composition between the rail and river transport would undoubtedly have the effect of lowering freight rates from Bussorah to Bagdad and rice versd, which aie now exorbitant, but as the German Company by Article 9 of their Concession obtains navigating rights on the river during the construction of the line, it seems improbable that, after acquiring the necessary plant and establishing wharves and warehouses at Bagdad and Bussorah, it will relinquish entirely the advantages of navigation. It may thus acquire complete control of the traffic by water as well as by land, and in that case the present British interest in the carrying trade of the river, which does not exceed one-fourth of the whole, would not appear to have much prospect of further development. 1 n The Germans no doubt calculate, not only that new trade will be developed, but that the course of present trade will be altered. It is expected that British vessels will cease to be the chief medium between Europe and the East, and that passenger traffic with India will be almost absorbed by the Bagdad Bailway. Kathima, Koweit, Emm Kasr, or Warba, would be ten days from Berlin and three and a-half or four from Constantinople by the railway. A terminus at any one of these points would be from four to five days^ steaming from Bombay. The Bagdad Bailway Company will control the railways^ not only of Asia Minor and Mesopotamia, but also of Syria and Northern Arabia, and the Syrian railway system, now completed as far as Aleppo, will no doubt ultimately pass into its hands, as being the more powerful combination. With these advantages, it is not unlikely that the course of trade will be deflected, and that markets hitherto supplied from the South and the Persian Gulf will eventually be inundated with the manufactures of Central and Eastern Europe, and that these, encouraged by preferential treatment, will be in a position to supplant sea borne British goods. In this connection Clause 29 of the Concession has a sinister significance, for it restricts the opening of the Persian Gulf sections until the trunk line from Konia to Bagdad is open and working. The rights conferred on the Com pany by other Articles of the Concession are of a nature to assure it a monopoly of the economic exploitation of the country through which the line passes, and it is not improbable that British interests will he excluded from participating in the profits of any such development. As regards the export trade of the districts under consideration, which consists principally of cereals, dates, horses, liquorice, wool, hides, opium, gall-nuts, &amp;c., I do not see that our interests are likely to be seriously affected by the railway. Grain cultivated in regions adjacent to the Tigris and Euphrates, which are situated at a considerable distance from the proposed alignment of the railway, will continue to find its way down the river to Bussorah, where it is shipped in bulk with com paratively little trouble. Bates grown in gardens on the river banks are packed on the spot, and placed on board steamers moored ^opposite the gardens, which entails a minimum of time and labour. These require no railway to facilitate their export. The horse trade of Bagdad and the surrounding country will benefit by the facilities of the railway transport, and will no doubt travel direct to the Gulf terminus for r3 Inll Sul“?Sh^kh^o S Zld h for W °? 1 ' W,lich is ^ ^ from Amara will be transported b^rEdh^^N^n^areas^f^iiHiVitT 118 t0 be ? g e ?P orterl tf &gt; Europ the railway, will naturally benefit hv n ml fi ^ tl0n » opened under the auspices of which will be to the general advantage. ^ PnCe 0t CLTea s may fal1 in con sequence, bearinf;hL”Mver e n xl“on HV’, 6has 8 political Mesopotamian deirfnrtho r^stf t1r- m ei ' eStS n 11 t,ie soheme c “ tre ^ bum enmkf^hrn *&gt;»' i-'wfS “;s ffsS 2 £S {TSW^rtR nation for more than two and a-half centurion will h* i a ! l01e1 ^ 11 and a le^itimatp fiolrl nf “Irf- f centuries, will be eclipsed and must disappear, closed atainS ns r ° P oll * l&lt; ; al . and commercial development will be definitely clmed a amst us Commercial interests gradually assume political importance in bvtasofoCth^ erv Z 61 '^C ® 41 ; 018 t he rail 'Wwill all, control fhe county •/ti l V y nature of the enterprise which will require adequate protection i ic .me of communication is to be kept open.

Northern Mesopotamia, and Mustapha Rasha is said to have established a reign of terror from Dhrbekir to Mosul. On the Bagdad-Nedief Zobeir sections of the railway the Montifik Arabs hold the key of the situation, and will have to be corsidered. The civilizing influence of the railway must help to restore some measure of order and security in these places, where Turkish misgovern- ment does nothing hut exasperate a semi-harbarous people, and encourages lawlessness by breaking faith with Arab tribesmen and subjecting them to the caprice and exactions of irresponsible and corrupt officials. German influence will permeate these regions, and, stimulated by the cheapness of German manufactures, a current of feeling may set in hostile, if not directly antagonistic, to British interest. These would, perhaps, he best served if we undertook the task of making some portion of the railway ourselves, and if we controlled and managed the southern sections of the line from Bagdad to Bussorah and the Persian Gulf, as well as the branch line to Khanikin on the Persian frontier. The other points mentioned are beyond my province, and I feel very incompetent to express any opinion on them. Mohammerah and Persia .—As regards Mohammerah and Persia, generally the Karim is, of course, the chief base of operations for the future development of trade routes from the South of Persia, whether the line taken is Shuster Khoremabad and Burujird, connecting through Sultanabad with the carriage road between ^Kum and Tehran, or whether traffic follows the Lynch road across the Bakhtiari Mountains to Isfahan. The difficulties attending animal transport in Persia are only too well known, and although the Ahwaz-Isfahan route is 253 miles shorter than that from Bushire to Isfahan, the road in either case crosses mountains of great altitude, and there are always the same road obstacles for heavily loaded mules. Under these circumstances it seems probable that the opening of the Bagdad Bailway, with a terminus on the Persian Gulf, and a branch line from Bagdad to Khanikin, will cause a deflection in sea-borne imports from the Karim route to that via Bagdad and Khanikin, where they will have easier and more rapid access to the northern and central Persian markets. As the line will he connected with Eastern and Central Europe, Khanikin will be brought into touch with other centres of trade, and the result may well be that Isfahan and Northern Persia wall ultimately be supplied with continental goods at less cost than that at which sea-borne British goods are now imported. In other words, the Bagdad Bailway may close the Karun route for foreign imports, in so far as Northern and Central Persia are concerned. Anything which tends to emancipate trade from the intense conservatism of the Persian muleteer, who now controls the carrying trade of the country, must he to the general advantage, and although a railway as far as Khanikin would not enable us to dispense with mule transport for our imports beyond that point, there would be a considerable saving of time and distance, which should to some extent compensate us for the closing of other routes to imported trade. The export of wheat in good seasons was an important feature in the estimate of future traffic on the Karun Biver,and I do not think the Bagdad Railway wdl a ^ t 0 f'the^granaries of the Si SSSSSfK- •&lt;‘t p CT.

The Mn branch will collect the f eat pa.senger traffic of the Shiite nilsrrims who visit the sacred shrines at Kerbela and JNecljer. Pr„f«''-in the Persian Gulf the following points appear to me to affect British interests:— (a ) The choice of a terminus. (b ) The transmission of mails to India by the Bagdad Railway. (A The potential dangers in a trans-continental highway towards India. (A) The stipulation in the Concession regarding the delay m constructing the Gulf section untU the Constantinople-Bagdad sections are completed, which operates clearly in restraint of British trade. It was stated in 1902 that “we sought no material advantages for ourselves in the Persian Gulf, beyond those which British trade and shipping could reap from the freedom and security of commerce and navigation in open competition with the rest of The advantages of our position enabled us to make this assumption, hut it is an open question whether we shall hold the same view when the Bagdad Railway reaches its terminus on the Gulf. The German fleet will then have been doubled, and we shall be face to face with a great military and naval Power, advantageously based on a railway ten days from Berlin and four from Bombay. Commercially we may have to compete with a German coasting service, drawing coal and supplies from the railway terminus, and able, through preferential treatment for German land-borne manu factures, to displace us in the Gulf markets. Onr interests, political and commercial alike, render unwise the surrender of our pre-eminence in the Persian Gulf. The maximum gain that can be shown in favour of the Bagdad lonte for Indian mails appears to be one day and sixteen hours, which may he still fmtlier reduced hy accelerating our own steam-ship service. Taking into consideration the risks the mails would run through Turkey on a trans-continental line in the control and management of which we do not participate, the compensator} advantages seem small. # As regards the terminus, Koweit appears to me to he the most suitable spot, as being within our sphere or influence, though how long we shall continue to enjoy our ascendency there when it has become the outlet for the railway I am at a loss to conjecture. Umm-Kasr seems to me too land-locked. Bussorah would make the best commercial terminus, hut the bar would have to he dredged, and Warba Island seems to offer the greatest enginering facilities. There is no doubt that the construction of the line from the Gulf should he undertaken concurrently with that of the other sections. Any other course is prejudicial to our commercial and political interests. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) P. E. CROW. P.S.

A Inclosure 2 in No. 1 . Major Cox to Consul Crow. My dear Crow, Bushire, January 8 , 1907. TOUR wire of the 4th instant, asking for my views on the aspect of the Bagdad Railway question as stated therein. I could not get a moment to touch it until' thisevening, ami as you have put it, the question is a somewhat comprehensive one to - handle m a letter “ by return,” and this I expect you want. You have said nothing of the all-important question of the terminus and the control thereof. Preferably the control of the Bagdad-Gulf section, with control of the terminus ^?r, failing both, the control of the port without control of the Bagdad section, is, f take it, the utmost we can hope to secure now under the most favourable circum stances, and your telegram seems to suggest that you desire my views on the premises that we have failed to assure ourselves of even that much. Starting from that basis, there seem to be four alternatives to consider:— 1 . An all-German line, with its terminus in independent Koweit territory under German control. 2. An all-German line, with its terminus in Turkish territory, say, at some point on the Khor Abdullah or Khor Zobeir, which we are prepared to recognize as Turkish territory. 3. An all-German line with its terminus at Bussorah. 4. An all-German line ending at Bagdad. I will discuss them briefly in the above order— ( 1 .) I devoutly hope that ( 1 ) may be eliminated from serious consideration, and that, in view of our understanding with Sheikh Mubarek, His Majesty’s Government would not tolerate it under any circumstances. It would be by far the most damaging solution for us, both commercially, strategically, and politically. Prom the commercial standpoint, we should have a great increase in the foreign steamer traffic, and probably a specific State-aided campaign by Germany directed against our predominant position as carriers of sea-borne trade to these waters. Their steamers would come for dates, as at present, and for grain, if the hinterland of Koweit were irrigated for cultivation, as it probably will be. They would bring cargoes of German produce for distribution up the line from this end. Strategically, we should have a potential naval base and supply dep 6 t, fed by a railway controlled by a rival naval Power, within 1,200 miles of Karachi, and we should have German men-of-war cruising about the Gulf “ fishing in troubled waters.” Politically, we should suffer immensely in prestige and in regard to our present predominant influence among the maritime Arabs as “keepers of the peace by sea.” Por the last eighty years or more w r e have been a tradition with them all, and almost a fetish with many. Lastly, I have no doubt that the pearl fisheries, the preservation of which to the Arabs has been the corner-stone of our policy and influence, would be invaded by the European element with their scientific appliances. (2.) The commercial and strategical disadvantages in this case seem much the same. The political damage which w T e stood to suffer might be balanced to some extent if we took the unlikely course of occupying Koweit and Bahrein as 3 P i* o t o c t o 6 s (3.) This alternative would be much less damaging to us strategically and politically, but equally detrimental to us commercially. The Bailway Company, possibly with secret State aid, would presumably make it their business to cut freights between Bussorah and Bagdad so as to be able to compete with the river-borne traffic. Thev would also endeavour to oust British-Indian goods from the promising market which now exists for it via Khanikin and Kermanshah. Their operations would also prejudice the development of the Karun route, especially the prospective artery via Dizful and Khoremabad. In all the foregoing cases (1, 2, and 3) the Germans would certainly use their convenient position and increasing knowledge of this region to encourage the Porte to encroach and extend their influence in Nejd and on the Arab coast, greatly to our detriment ne ^ anv case p 0ss ibiy be linked up with the Damascus-Mecca, line or with Medina or Mecca direct, and they will be in a favourable position for securing the control of that line when the time comes and of the pilgrim traffic with it. f4 i This is the alternative that I should like personally to see. It would no doubt be used to oust us as far as possible from the South-West Persian market above referred to ; at the same time, unless British-Indian goods were penalized, some compensation for the competition experienced on the Khanikm-Kermanshah line might be found in the throwing open of Mesopotamia to commerce generally, m which British-Indian goods might find a place. f ,'' Ti r ! fife • 13 ni/I nnf conveniently come far enough south to enablp^her'to “^^kcy nu.eh ia the direction of expansion in Central Arabia.

I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Secret telegram dated the 3rd f4th) January, asking for my observations as to the effect that the Bagdad Railway' is likely to have on British interests if completed without British ^ *2.^As regards the political interests of the British nation, I can add nothing to the remarks°contained in the letter which I addressed to his Excellency the Ambassador a few months ago. . . 3. As regards the commercial interests of Great Britain, I think that tnese are likely to be forwarded hy a railway from the Mediterranean to the Beisian Gulf, because such a railway must tend to ‘develop the country and to reduce freights from the port on the Gulf to Bagdad, and to Khanikin on the Persian frontier. 4. Putting aside all political considerations, it appears to me desirable that we should take part in the railway for the following reasons ( 1 .) If we do not take part, it is not likely that any of the plant required for the construction and up-keep of the railway will be bought in England. (2.) It is not likely that any Englishman will be employed. (3.) The office of every foreign official will he a centre from which the interests of foreign trade can, and probably will, be pushed. This argument applies not only to the export and import trade, but especially to the advantages that will accrue to the foreigners in obtaining opportunities of controlling local industries. Eor examj le, British machinery would find it very difficult to compete with German machinery if German mechanics were the experts who could most conveniently be consulted. I cannot help thinking that Mesopotamia will offer a great opening for agricultural machinery as the country developes. (4.) Without British participation it would be difficult, if not impossible, to guard against preference being given to trade from the north. Plausible excuses could no doubt be found by an astute and hostile Railway Manager for charging higher rates on the southern sections of the line; and even if the rates per mile were uniform throughout the length of the line, the southern trade could be hampered by heavy landing and port charges, by want of storing conveniences, and by a rule insisting on all documents being in German and Turkish.

With the rivers closed, Biitish trade might he made to pay under the guise of freight, a considerable share of the guarantee given by the Turkish Government to the Bagdad Railway Company. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) J. RAMSAY. Inclosure 5 in No. 1 . Consul Longworth to Mr. G. Barclay. (No. 4. Confidential.) Sir, Aleppo, January 4, 1907. IN reply to your telegram of yesterday’s date, I would submit the following observation on the question as to the effect of the Bagdad Railway on British interests in Egypt and Aden, should it be completed as far as Adana and Aleppo. The construction of the three sections—namely, fromEregli southwards to Adana, eastwards to Tel-ITabesh, and south again to Aleppo—would result in linking together the lines made and being made from Constantinople to Mecca. Viewed from a geheral standpoint—political, military and economic—such an attainment, reached by the exertions of whatever Company, would I think be in no way prejudicial to our interests in Anatolia or Syria, Arabia or Egypt. The more these regions are open to facilities of communication and inter course the more are we likely to gain popularity with the inhabitants and influence with the authorities. Pilgrims and traders from north, south, and east, brought into closer touch, would doubtless make comparisons and draw conclusions, invidious enough, perhaps, on the state of security, order, and prosperity in dominions under British rule and protection. The feelings of the people being on our side, we are likely to have within the country, even in the event of hostilities, more friends than enemies. A' less favourable aspect of the question, as regards mainly Egypt, would, however, present itself should the Mediterranean be ever brought into railway connection with the Persian Gulf. A great part of the traffic would then revert to its old route across Mesopotamia, a deviation which would affect not only the Suez Canal as the passage, but Aden as the emporium of the Indo-European trade. It behoves ns, therefore, to be on the alert lest such a railway falls into not altogether friendly hands. I would venture to lay in this connection the utmost stress on the necessity of Englishmen obtaining, conjointly with Erenchmen, if needs be, such a concession.ITl,.;.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 184, Secret, of the 20th March, 1906, I have the honour to report that Mr. Herbert Nichols, who is, I believe, known at the Foreign Office, called on me on the 4th instant on behalf of Mr. d’Arcy, to ask for my conditional support in the negotiations with the Civil List for a Concession to work the oil-fields of Mesopotamia. the negotiations are, as you are aware, being carried on at present between the Civil List and Messrs. Gilchrist and Walker, of Constantinople, previous negotiation with a German group having broken down. Messrs. Gilchrist and Walker are endeavouring to induce Mr. d’Arcy and the Burmah Oil Company, who hold a similar Concession in Persia, to provide the necessary funds for securing the Mesopotamia Concession, but Mr. d’Arcy, who has sunk 250,000/., and the Burmah Company, who have sunk 100,000/. in Persia, hitherto without return, hesitate to come forward without reasonable security. The Civil List ask for 30,000/. for “ preliminary expenses,” and for a deposit of 50,000/. as caution money, to be returned to the concessionnaires if, after exploration, the oil-fields do not appear likely to yield adequate profits. Mr. Nichols is now instructed by Mr. d’Arcy to ask whether he would have the support of His Majesty’s Embassy in securing the return of the caution money should the case arise. I have told him that if his contract is made with a responsible Depart ment of the Ottoman Government he would certainly have the support always given by this Embassy to British subjects endeavouring to secure their rights. I venture to point out that there is every ground for believing that this Concession, especially as Mesopotamia is developed by the extension of railway communications and irrigation works, will prove exceedingly valuable, and, as I observed in my earlier despatch, the creation of such important British interests in that country will greatly enhance our influence and general position. This being so, you may think it perhaps desirable to speak of the matter to some of the gentlemen who are connected with the Burmah Company. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) N. R. O’CONOR.

Therefore, the Government last year paid the maximum kilometric guarantee, and the Company has had to suffer the loss of the difference between the drop of £T. 35,470 in the receipts and the increase of £ T. 19,201 in the kilometric guarantee, namely £ T. 16,269.

Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received January 21 .) (No. 34.) Sir, ll( ^ no &lt; ur to acknowledge the receipt of your despatch No. 558 of the 22 nd ultimo, inclosing a copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s Ambassador in l aris, m which Sir F Bertie reports a conversation witli M. Gaston Auboyneau, Administrator of the Ottoman Bank in Paris, respecting the recent action of the l reach Delegate on the Ottoman Debt in the matter of the Debt’s guarantee for an annual sum of £ T. 250,000 for Macedonia. I haA e no reason to doubt that M. Auboyneau’s opinion is correct, that there exists an Agreement between Germany and the Sultan for the eventual application of the suiplus ol the ceded revenues as security for loans for the construction of the Bagdad Railway. When this Agreement is to become operative is, of course, uncertain, but^ the anxiety shown by Baron Marschall for the conclusion of the Customs negotiations before March, which is the date spoken of by Germans in Constantinople for the resumption of construction work on the Bagdad Railway, lends some colour to the belief entertained by many, that the hypothecation of the surplus^ of the ceded revenues is conditional on, and is to be simultaneous with, the Powers consent to the 3 per cent, customs increase. M. Auboyneau is, I think, wrong in stating that this surplus is tied up for three years. I am given to under stand by Mr. Block, as reported in my telegram No. 216 of the 7th ultimo, that even though since M. Auboyneau’s interview with Sir F. Bertie the surplus has been pledged for an additional sum of £ T. 250,000, all but the permanent charges will have been cleared off in the natural course by March 1909. The fact, however, that this surplus is tied up for a year or two need not preclude it from serving as security for a loan to be raised immediately, though the bonds would naturally have to be issued at a lower level than if the surplus of the ceded revenues were imme diately available for interest; but, besides this consideration, it is not at all impossible that the provisional charges will be wiped off long before 1909, either with the proceeds of a loan, or with funds from some other source, and in this connection it is not out of place to mention that a scheme is on foot, under the auspices of M. Rouvier Government will receive a lump sum of £ T. 3,000,000. I am surprised at M. Auboyneau’s statement that the Ottoman Bank has had no negotiations with the Deutsche Bank or with Mr. Gwinner regarding the Bagdad 9 th November, regarding the 3 per cent, interest in the customs duties, was drafted, the German Ambassador was anxious that the negotiations between the Porte and the Debt, with a view to the guarantee for Macedonia, should he deferred until Commandant Berger’s return from leave, and his Excellency was, I am convinced, himself responsible for the insertion in the note of the passage to this effect. It may oe presumed, therefore, with some confidence, that Baron Marschall felt sure that he could count on the French Delegate’s attitude in the negotiations, and 1 cannot quite divest myself of the suspicion that Commandant Berger, who some time before had telegraphed to Mr. Block that he entirely agreed with him as to pledging the surplus of the ceded revenues as well as the tithes surplus for Macedonia, was furnished with instructions, at German bidding, by his group in Paris to protect the former surplus as far as possible for the purpose of the Bagdad Railway. This, however, is now a question of merely academic interest. What is really important is the assurance given to Sir F. Bertie by M. Auboyneau that in all dealings in connection with the Bagdad Railway the Ottoman Bank will act in accordance with the wishes of the French Government. It is to be hoped that the Bank will act loyally up to this assurance. [2306 x—1] and Bleichroder’s, for the extention of the tobacco monopoly by which the Ottoman Railway for several months.

Mr. Cartwright to Sir Edward Grey .—(Received January 28.) (No. 7. Confidential.) ^ r ’ T „ . , ri? . Munich, January 25, 1907. 1^ HAVE the honour to report that since my return to Munich I have been trying m various ways to obtain some information with regard to the present position of the Bagdad Bailway question in Germany, but I find in banking circles great reticence when dealing with this subject, and the attitude assumed by bankers generally towards a foreigner who tries to make inquiries as to the Bagdad scheme is that there is plenty of money in Germany to complete the undertaking. I have succeeded, however, in obtaining indirectly some slight information on the financial side of the Bagdad Railway scheme which it may be of interest to report to you. Herr Tischler, one of the Directors of the Branch in Munich of the Berlin Imperial Bank, stated to my informant that negotiations were going on between Paris and London with regard to the participation of French and English capital in the undertaking and that until these negotiations had made more progress he was reluctant to discuss the situation of the Bagdad Railway. This much, however, my informant obtained from Herr Tischler that Germany’s desire for the participation of foreign capital was clearly indicated by the international character given to all publications, statements and appeals made by the German Syndicate as to the construction of the railway, but Germany never would nor could consent to yield up tier prerogatives, that is to say, the control of the enterprise; and if the participation of foreign capital could only be obtained by the surrender of her position, she would renounce such foreign assistance, and in his opinion she would be able, if put to it, to obtain the necessary financial help in this country for the completion of the enterprise, but he added that Germany would prefer at present not to have to face such an eventuality. From inquiries I have made from persons connected with the Munich Bourse I gather that scarcely anybody here takes the slightest interest in the Bagdad scheme or holds any shares in that enterprise, in fact I am told that no quotations are made as to the shares of the Company as there is no business done here with regard to them. A financial person stated that there was “ keine Stimmung ” (no interest), among Bavarian investors for very distant enterprises, but in his opinion there seemed to be a slight change in this attitude of quite recent date for he had noticed that there was some disposition to invest in a new Siamese Loan and this might be taken as an indication that should the Bagdad Railway Syndicate try to float a loan in Germany a certain amount, though probably small, might be subscribed in Munich. I may add that the presence of Herr Dernburg in South Germany and the propaganda he is carrying on in favour of mining, railway, and other undertakings in the Colonies, as reported in my despatch No. 4, Confidential, of the 23rd instant, is not unlikely to arouse in the public, perhaps only temporarily, an interest in speculative enterprises in distant countries.

Reference Notes on Towns along the Trace of Bagdad Railway from West to East. 1. Adana. ADANA is a town of 645,000 inhabitants, and the capital of a vilayet. There are about 10,000 Armenians and Greeks, and the remainder are Turks and fellah Arabs, with a strange admixture of Ansarie Persians, Afghans, and some Hindoos. In harvest time, for the wheat and cotton harvest, about 5,000 more labourers come into the town. It is a very flourishing town, the centre for the rich Cilician Plain, and has some large cotton mills, with good bazaars and shops. The town is on the right bank of tbe Saihun, a broad deep stream, which supplies the best drinking water. Spring and autumn somewhat unhealthy, with a damp heat in summer. Extensive vineyards and gardens, irrigated by water-wheels, surround the place. 2. Missis. Missis is a small place of 200 houses; about 1,000 inhabitants, chiefly Moslems, with 70 Armenians, Greeks, and Cretan refugees on the right bank of the Kiver Jaihun, where the Adana-Alexandretta road crosses by a bridge. [2345 d—l] B3 . Alexandretla. Alexandretla is the seaport of the Allepo Province, and connected with that town by %Tl d rheta d t r o 0 f d a Kai-nakam nnder Allepo; contains some 1 000 houses with 10 000 inhabitants, of whom two-thirds are Greek, built close along the shore of the k * j ' T.J wS .i ™ 5 «.* ^ v can anchor from 200 to 400 yards from the shore in 7 to 10 ^ lighters.

The Prince Line from Newcastle, the Leyland, Moss and Bell’s Asia Minor Lines, the Pappayanui Line from Liverpool, the Khedivial Mail from Alexandria, with the Messageries Maritimes, Austio-Hungarian Lloyd, German Levant Line, Italian, Greek, and Turkish Lines. There are Austrian and French post-offices. A British Vice-Consul, and Consulates of other Powers. 4. Country between Alexandretta and Aleppo. Immediately east of Alexandretta, the road leads over the Bailan Pass, in the Amanus (Giaour Dagh) Range. The range is sparsely wooded, has numerous ravines, and the summit of the pass by which the “ chaussee ” crosses is 1,980 feet above sea-level. Mr. Pauling, who in 1896 specially reported on the practicability of a railway, thought the line could cross the hills just south of the road by a short tunnel, and no great difficulties of construction would be involved. Beyond the Amanus is a wide valley, through the southern end of which passes the Orontes, and which also contains a large marshy lake, the borders of which forms an excellent pasturage for cattle, sheep, and horses during the summer, but which in spring extends over and floods the country for some distance. A branch road leads down to Antioch, near the mouth of the Orontes, the centre of a fertile district. To the north, a long depression, with several small, marshy lakes and streams, runs up to Marash, at the foot of the Taurus. This district is not as populous as might be owing chiefly to the malaria caused by the numerous lakes, but it could be improved. The direct route to Aleppo passes through the stony ridges of Kalaat Saman, which the “chaussee ” avoids by a wide bend to the north through well-cultivated level ground, which extends up to and beyond Killis. 5. Antioch (Antakia). Antioch is a well-built town of 25,000 inhabitants, among extensive gardens, on the left bank of the Orontes. Steep hills rise to the south, and the valley is filled with gardens. It is the seat of a Kaimakam under Aleppo, and a rich trading centre for cereals, cotton, and liquorice root. The ruins and walls of the old town extend some distance outside the modern limits of the town. A good road leads to Alexandretta over the Bailan Pass. 6 . Aleppo {Haleb). Aleppo has a population of 108,000, of whom some 25,800 are Christians and 8,000 Jews; is the capital of a vilayet, and the most important commerical centre in3 Koweik, a small stream from the nortl wtrT f' ound , ? hlefl ^ 011 the left bank of the by gardens in the vicinity of the town ’ T tr, “ '''f dneS In summer . and is bordered Ibrahim Pasha during the E&lt;&gt;rptian occunat ^ 6 a * le the larSe bat ' racks erected by enough for carts.

Birijik is an important town on the left bank of the Euphrates at the crossing of the pnncipal trade route from Diarbekr to Aleppo and Alexandretta. It is built °on the slopes of a ravine in a whitish limestone clifif above the river, is surrounded by an ancient wail and contains a ruined stronghold which defended the passage of the river which has been crossed here from the earliest times. It contains some 10,000 inhabitants, mixed Turk, Arab, and Kurd, with some Armenians and Jews, and 13 the principal trade centre of these districts for cereals butter, olive oil, and grapes. ecieais, Water plentiful from a spring 1 above the town. Southwards along the river for some 90 miles is a fertile belt of land producing Without irrigation wheat and barley, containing scattered mud villages, and extending on both banks ot the river for some 5 miles. Passage of the Euphrates. The river at ordinary level is 300 yards wide, and 8 to 10 feet deep, with a fairly strong current. In flood season it becomes 600 yards wide. The approaches on the left bank are much steeper than those on the right. At present the crossing is made in thirteen ferry-boats of rough wooden construction. At Khalfati, some 18 miles up stream, the river is 200 yards wide and 25 feet deep, with a current of about 3 miles an hour, between steep cliffs of white limestone. 8 . Killis. r Killis (altitude, 2,080 feet) is a place of 12,000 inhabitants, of whom the majority are Turks, and 4,000 Armenians. Houses of stone, flat-roofed, standing in a mass of vineyards and gardens famous for their olives and fruits. A very fertile plain extends north-west to Aintab. The place itself is Turkish, with a large Armenian quarter to the north-east, and a quarter containing Arabs and Circassians on the other side. Good water from wells and springs in the hills behind the town.9. Aintab. AinHb ('altitude 3,600 feet), the seat of a Kaimakam under Aleppo, is a well-built town wHh paved stkt and many two-storied houses in the centre of a very fert.le but treeiess district ^ about of whom half are Christians, including 15,000 Armenians There is a rich and flourishing Protestant community, with an American mission collesre and mission hospital. ^ j &lt;&lt; ' &gt;j Water from the neighbouring hills through an old aqueduct. Good “ chaussee ” leads to Alexandretta through Killis, and a road to Birijik much used by caravans. Extensive vineyards, pistachio, and olive groves in the vicinity Country gently undulating towards Birijik, stony ridges, with well-cultivated valleys and several streams. • ••• F.Yfpnsivft olive aroves at Nisib, about half-way to Birijik. 10. Country between Birijik and Diarbekr. The direct route from Birijik to Diarbekr avoids Urfa, and passes north ot it through Huvek, and so to Suverek and Diarbekr. . After the ascent from the Euphrates Valley at Birijik, a plateau country with low, stony hills is entered, and shortly after undulating cultivated ground, with several large villages deriving water from wells. Country bare, open, and undulating, with much cultivation of wheat and barley. Huvek is a large village with good water from a stream. Suverek is a poor place ot 5,000 inhabitants, Ivurds and Armenians, among vineyards, with water from springs. Beyond Suverek, a gently undulating country with deep heavy soil, mostly untilled, but growing good grass in spring. The northern slopes of the Karaja Dagh are easy, and present no difficulties to the road. Hills are here strewn with volcanic boulders ; the country is undulating, with fertile though stony soil; several villages deiiving water from springs and streams. A stony plain, but with heavy fertile soil, extends for the last 25 miles before Diarbekr is reached. The Urfa Plain opens southw ards into that of Harran ; is very fertile, with numerous villages and fairly well cultivated, although the advent of a railway would induce increased production. The district of Seruj (between Urfa and Birijik) is also a fertile one, with many villages. Inhabitants, Kurds, part settled and part nomad. 11. Urfa. Urfa, the ancient Edessa, is the seat of a Mutessarif under Aleppo, with a population numbering 20,000, of whom 7,500 are Armenians, with about 4,000 Syrians, Jacobite Christians, and Jews. In the villages of the Urfa Plain, including the city, is a population ot some 30,000 Armenians. There is a large Protestant community with an American mission in the town. The town is built on two rocky hills, one crowned by a ruinous citadel, and the ancient walls still partly surround the place. A large spring supplies the town with water, and many small springs exist in the plain and are utilized for irrigation. Fuel is very scarce and expensive. The district route from Birijik to Urfa for a railway is to be avoided because of the steep descent among rocky hills into the Urfa Plain. The German trace of the Bagdad line avoids this by crossing the Euphrates at Jerablus, below Birijik, and passing through Harran in the plain 25 miles south of Urfa. A branch is proposed from Harran up to Urfa. The northern trace, going from Birijik to Diarbekr, would pass through Huvek, from which a short branch could be constructed to Urfa. 12. Harr an. Harran, although standing amongst extensive ruins, is now r only a small village of mud huts, a few tents, a ruined castle, and a mosque. The population are half Arab and half Kurd.13. Veranshehr.

Mar ash. Marash is a thriving town of 40,000 inhabitants, a third of whom a-e Armenians and the seat of a Mutessarif under Aleppo. It is situated at the foot of some steep outliers ot the inurus, and overlooks a wide, well-watered plain to the south. t is a prosperous town, and the plain is well cultivated with corn and rice, while near the town are vineyards and fruit gardens, while the hills to the north afford excellent pasturage for sheep. . r ^ e summer climate is rather unhealthy, owing to extensive rice-growing on the p am; but the high-lying quarter of the town is healthy, and admirably supplied with water from springs. A good road leads to Aintab, and through there to Aleppo and Alexandretta. Other communications through the northern hills and to the west are difficult tracks. 17. Diarbehr. Diarbekr is an important commercial centre on a steep bluff* overlooking the right hank of the Upper Tigris. It contains some 38,000 inhabitants, nearly half being Christian (Armenians, Jacobites, Chaldeans, and Greek), with the remainder Turks, Kurds, and Turkomans. In Boman times it was Amida, an important frontier post, and is still surrounded by thick masonry walls built at that period, with subsequent additions. Bruit gardens, which produce wonderfully in this volcanic soil, line the slope down to the river. Water supply plentiful and fairly good from springs and an aqueduct. [2345 d—l] CThe plain to the north, extending nearly up to Arg-hana on the Kharput road, is fertile, growing good corn crops, dotted with villages, and has several streams. At Arghana Maden are copper-mines, which are known to be of the most productive nature, with remarkably pure ore. They are of considerable extent, and the mineral area extends also to Piran and some places north-east. At present, for want of wood fuel, there is a considerable difficulty in smelting on the spot, and the ore is taken to Tokat, several days’journey. „ . The richest corn-producing district is that eust of Oiarbekr, in the \vide area between the foot of the Sassun Mountains and the ligiis. ihib undulating plain country has many large streams, is extremely fertile, and produces^ ceieals and cotton for export. The ruins of the large cities of Tigranocerta and Kharzan aie in this district. , Diarbekr is a very important route centre whence “ chaussees raoiate to Alexandretta, Kharput, and Mardin, with caravan roads to Hitlis, Sairt, and Mosul through Jezire. The place is also an important telegraph centre. There are Consuls for Great Britain and France. 18. Mar din, Mardin is the seat of a Mutessarif under Diabekr, built on the south side of a prominent conical hill crowned by an ancient citadel, and commanding an extensive view over the plain to the south. It has a population of 27,000, of whom half are Christians of the Armenian, Chaldean, Jacobite, and Protestant communities, and the remainder Kurds and Arabs. The streets are very steep, generally paved in steps, with a few good two-storied houses; but the bazaars are poor for the size of the town. The climate is dry and healthy. Water from springs, which sometimes fail in summer. Mardin is the chief centre of Jacobite Christians of the Tor Abdin Hills close by, and Deir Zaferan Monastery close by is the residence of their Patriarch. It is an important American mission station. The Tor Abdin Hills, though stony, grow vines well, and the valleys are fertile. 19. Country between Diarbekr and Mardin. The main caravan route passes through Khaniki on its way to Mardin (62 miles). The first part along the Tigris is fairly well cultivated ; the latter part before reaching Mardin is through rocky hills with dry ravines, and the crossing of the watershed would be the most difficult part for railway construction. From Mardin to Nisibin the country is level with many villages ; w r ater from wells. From Nisibin to Feishkhabur over level cultivated plain through Aznaour, passing many Kurdish villages (water rather deficient here from poor wells), then over open, undulating country sometimes cultivated, somedmes stony, and sometimes grassland. Springs and villages very frequent. Then through some low hills, and a long, gradual descent to the Tigris over gently undulating country generally cultivated, past several villages of Hassana Kurds. Good springs ; soil fertile. Direct route from Nisibin to Mosul adopted by the trace of the German Concession; has practically no villages, and a very poor or non-existent water supply, except for a few miles after leaving Ndsibin. 20. Feishkhabur, I eishkbabur (Peshkhabur) is a small village on the le.t bank of the Tigris, close to its junction with the Khabur, a large stream flowing irom the Kurdish mountains through Zakho. It contains ^00 houses of Papal Chaldeans in the centre of a fertile area, growing wheat, rice, and cotton, with fruit orchards along the streams. J lie I igris is 120 yards wide and 10 feet to 15 feet deep in the ordinary channel— widening to 650 yards or TOO yards in the fiood season—between rather steep banks of conglomerate and gravel. Hed of river shingle and gravel. Many Kurdish villages with abundant water, and surrounded by vineyards along the hill-slopes towards Zakuo. At Derebun, on the hill above Feishkhabur, is a very large spring out of the rock.21. Zakho. Zakho is a place of 4,000 inhahifnnfc ™ n an island in the Khabur. It is the seat of a P la ^ ea ?

Jezire-ibn-Omar. Jezire-ibn-Omar is on a low-lying plain adjoining the right bank of the r tVris where the river emerges from some deep gorges in the Kurdish hills, and is chfeflv important as the crossing place of the Mosul-Diarbekr caravan road. It stands on the ruins of the Roman fiontier fortress of Bezabde, which then covered the nlace of crossing. 1 u A bridge of boats is used now, but the ruins of a masonry bridge exist a few miles down. There are 7,500 inhabitants of Kurds, of which 500 are Chaldean Christians. in the spring it is the crossing-place for the nomad Kurdish tribes, who winter on the plams west of the Tigris, and then wish to cross over to the upland pastures south or Lake Van. . that time it is a considerable market for wool and other produce of the tribes which is floated down to Mosul and Bagdad on rafts of inflated skins. The river channel is here 150 yards wide and 15 feet deep in June, but in flood it covers a width of 400 yards. There is a Kaimakam under Mosul. 23. Mosul. Mosul is the principal town in Upper Mesopotamia and capital of vilayet of the same name, situated on the right bank of the Tigris, opposite the ruins of Nineveh. It was formerly one of the principal stages on the trade route from east to west, and the large towns of Nineveh and Nimrod close by derived much of their importance from this. It is still a great meeting-point of caravan routes from Bagdad, West Persia, Bitlis, and Diarbekr, besides being the centre of very productive districts on the iar bank of the river up to the foot of the Kurkish hills. Population 40,000, mostly Arab and Kurd races, with about 7,000 Christians (Chaldeans, Catholic Syrians, Jacobites) and some Jews. There are French and German Consuls, and a British Consular Agent. Houses of stone set in gypsum, the larger houses often built round a courtyard. Mater from the Tigris and from ratiier brackish wells. Bazaar busy and bustling, thronged with Arabs, Kurds, Christians, Jews, and Mosulis. Besides wheat and wool, there is a trade in oakgalls, cotton, gum, and hides. The most numerous (about 500 houses) are the Catholic Syrians, supported by a large French Dominican mission, and under the Archbishop o± Mosul. The Jacobites (also about 500 houses) have a Bishop, and number some of the richest and influential citizens. The Chaldeans (Catholic .Nestorians) are under an Archbishop, called the Patriarch of Babylon. There are but few Nestorians under the Patriarch Mar Shimun.- '; The Church Missionary Society have a small establishment. The Government is usually opposed by the Kurds and Arab elements. If the Vali is weak, as happened recently, the power really lies in the hands of Muhammud Sapungi, a rich local Moslem with considerable influence. .. . . At one time Sapungi was in prison and banished, but again regained full power. Local frictions are always active in the place, and have again led to disturbances recentlv. The Tigris is crossed by a bridge, partly of stone and partly of boats. The actual river channel is 125 yards wide and 10 feet deep, but the whole width of river bed of shir.gle and gravel covered in flood only is 550 to 500 yards wide. 24. Caravan Route from Mosul to Diarbekr. This does not follow the direct route across the desert from Mosul to Xisibin (the proposed trace of the railway according to the German Concession), but keeps up the left bank of the Tigris through fertile and well-watered country through Zakho, to cross the river at the boat bridge of Jezire-ibn-Omar, thence it traverses a well populated country with fair water supply to Nisibin and Mardin. The direct route from Mosul to ISisibin is not used in summer by caravans owing to want of water along it, and owing to lack of villages. 25. Caravan Route from Mosul to Bagdad. This keeps on the left bank of the Tigris, also passing through the populous and fertile districts of Erbil, Kirkuk, and Kifri. The route along the right bank of the Tigris from Mosul to Bagdad is little used, chiefly owing to [want of supplies and of water on the part of the route crossing the Jebel Hamrin. 26. Kifri. Kifri (Salahie) is a place of 6,000 inhabitants on the Bagdad-Mosul road, situated on a stream at the mouth of a gorge in some low, gravelly hills which run east. The inhabitants are Kurds and Arabs, with a few Jews, and the plain produces good crops of wheat and barley, with an abundant supply of water. It is the seat of a Kaimakam under Bagdad. 27. Kirkuk. Kirkuk is a large and growing town of 40,000 inhabitants, principally Kurds, with &lt;00 Chaldean Christians, and included many villages, now almost suburbs, while the surrounding country is wonderfully fertile and increasing in prosperity, the market gardens being famous. In the vicinity are springs of petroleum which have never been properly exploited. AV heat, barley, beans, and cotton, and in summer various pulses, lentils, haricot beans, tobacco, melons, and a tew grapes are grown: 30,000 sheep, the property of the inhabitants, are said to be always on the pastures round the town. The place is the seat of a Mutessarif under Mosul, and an important military centre with the head-quarters of a division. Watei is from the Kissa Chai, which flow’s through the place. It is on the Bagdad— Mosul main caiavan mute, and a good road leads through Chemchemal to Suleimanie, in the Kurdish hills to the east. Erbil. Eibil, the ancient Arbela, is a place of about 15,000 inhabitants, mostly Kurds, the houses crowded together on an earthen mound rising 200 feet out of the level plain. It is the seat oi a Kaimakam, and an important point on the Bagdad—Mosul caravan route. Tracks lead eastward to Rowanduz to North-West Persia, and through Keni Saniak to Wazna Pass.

Its chief importance lies in its being a place of Shia pilgrimage for Persians, and it contains several fine mosques. The river here is 460 yards wide, with a current of 4 miles an hour. 33. Keui Sanjak. Keui Sanjak has a population of 7,500 Kurds with a few Chaldeans and Jews, stands in a fertile basin among gardens watered from a group of large springs and producing pomegranates, apricots, mulberries, figs, besides extensive vineyards. I he surrounding Kurdish hills have fertile valleys and slopes wooded with oak. Water everywhere abundant from springs and streams. . -A 11 ea sy route runs along the foot of the hills to Erbil and over into the Rania Plain. 34. Bagdad. Bagdad is the capital of a vilayet of same name, built on both banks of the Tigris, but principally on the left. It has a population of 130,060, of whom 70,000 are Moslems (both Sunni and Shia), 35,000 Jews, and 5,000 Christians (500 Chaldeans, 500 Armenians, and 200 Jacobites). Extensive bazaars arched with brick ; extensive transit trade with Persia through Kerniaushah as w r ell as by river steamers with Bussorah. British firms : Stephen Lynch and Co., agents ; Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navi gation Company; Messrs. J. C. P. Hotz and Co., London; Messrs. David Sassoon and Co., London, Bombay, and Calcutta ; with a German firm of Beck, Putman, and Co. There is a branch of the Imperial Ottoman Bank. There is a Consul-General for Great Britain, and Consuls for the other Powers. [2345 d— 1 ] D./ 10 Wheat/ barley, wool, and dates are the staple produce of the Mesopotamian Corn is sown in November or December and harvested in May or June. An autumn crop of maize, harvested about December, is often raised, too. Large herds of sheep, cattle, buffaloes are to be found, with camels, mules, and donkeys for transport. , , . . £ t i + u From October to May the climate is cool and invigorating; from July to the middle of September it is oppressively hot. j • a j orw The average width of the river is 250 yards wide, and in flood 30 to 36 leet deep, and is crossed by two boat bridges. , , T &gt; i j r +i » ^ The river route from Bussorah brings all tr;ide to Bagdad from the south, and the main road through Khanikin to Kermanshah leads into Persia, and that by Kirkuk and These are the principal routes, and there are others along the Euphrates V alley to Aleppo and Damascus and by the Tigris right bank to Bagdad, and also direct to Suleimanie. Towns on the Euphrates. 35. Museyib. Museyib is an important crossing, with boat bridge of the Bagdad-Kerbela road over the Euphrates. There are 1,000 houses, mostly on the left bank, and a large covered bazaar, with a floating population of about 1,500 more, mostly Shia Arabs, with many Persians. 36. Kerbela. Kerbela is on the plain, 20 miles west of the Euphrates, connected with it by the Husseinic Canal, which is also the water supply of the town. It contains 5,000 well- built houses, among date groves and gardens, among which the houses are often hidden. Population 60,000, mostly Arabs and Persians, with many Indian Moslems. There is a Vice-Consul for Great Britain. The Mosque of Hussein, also his burial place, is a peculiar object of veneration for all Shia Moslems, and thus the place is an important Persian religious centre and place of pilgrimage. It is also the centre of a busy agricultural district, and has a well-stocked and busy bazaar. 37. Nejef. Nejef has a population of 12,000, among whom are many Indian Moslems ; con tains a mosque with the shrine of Ali, and forms, with Kerbela, one of the Shia places of great sanctity, to which pilgrimages are made and bodies taken from Persia for burial. It is also a centre for the Beni Hassan Arabs. Water rather scarce from wells; but the best is obtainable from the Hindie Canal, 4 miles off. 38. Hilla. Hilla is the chief town of a kaza under Diwanie; has a population, including the gardens, of some 30,000, and stands amid extensive date gardens on both banks. There is a boat bridge. It is an important military centre from which to control the Arab tribes. The river channel is usually dry now, except in flood, owing to mismanagement of the Mmeyib barrage, which has forced all the Euphrates water down the Hindie Channel. This is having a serious effect on the date gardens and prosperity of this part of the country. 39. Diwanie. Diwanie stands on both banks of the Euphrates, but mostly on the east, among a small extent of date gardens.It has a Mutessarif under Ba»dad, and is looked which to control the Arabs of the Lower Euphrates. on as an important centre from Kumetha.

Bussorah. . The actua! town lie s 2 miles from the Shatt-ul-Arab River on a canal is within ruinous walls, and contains 18,000 inhabitants; but, with suburbs, the total population is about 40,000, mostly of Arabs, with 3,000 Persians, 1,000 Jews, and 400 Christians of various sects. Few Turks, besides Government officials. The Consulates and European warehouses are along the right bank of the Shatt-uI-Arab. Drinking water is from the river, and is not good. Steameis able to cross the bar at the mouth of the 8 hatt can ascend easily to Bussorah (67 miles from the sea), and vessels of light draft (small gun-boats) can [ascend,to Kurna. The steamers anchor in midstream, and all cargo is discharged into lighters. River steamers ascend the Tigris River to Bagdad, but cannot navigate the Euphrates, owing to shoal water in the marshes, about 50 miles above Kurna. Kative sailing boats manage to cross this obstruction, and by means of these river traffic is maintained with •Sama *a and the towns on the Dower Euphrates. Bussorah is famous for its date gardens, which line both banks of the river from Kurna to the sea. Corn and rice is also exported. There are British and other Consulates. 44. Zobeir. Zobeir is a small Arab town of 2,000 inhabitants in the desert, 10 miles west of Bussorah. Near it is a large spring of good water, and around is a considerable extent of well-cultivated ground. 45. Umkasr. Umkasr consists solely of two mud forts, one an old one now nearly in ruins, occa sionally occupied by Koweit Arabs, and a newer Turkish for some 30 yards square and of little strength, usually containing a small Turkish garrison.mm I - —«&amp;=&gt; . 1 ' ^0 is'i [^Document is the Property of His Britannic Lestvs ] [B] BAGDAD RAILWAY.

Berger had been blamed not only for not acting with Mr. Block, but for not communicating to the French Ambassador at Constantinople his intention not to vote with the British Delegate on the final issue to be settled in the Debt Council, and his failure to delay matters so that the opportunity might be ffiven to the trench Ambassador to refer M. Berger’s intentions to the French Government tor consideration. M. Henry was ignorant of or ignored the fact that M. Constans had reported to the French Government that M. Berger had refused to accept his recommendation to concert with Mr. Block the course to be followed by both of them. I did not mention that fact to M. Henry, but I suggested to him that, much as M. Bergei had been blameworthy, the person chiefly responsible for the regrettable situation was the French Ambassador at Constantinople, whose sympathies in the question of the Bagdad Bailway were, as I well knew, not those of the French Govern ment. He did not appear to have insisted with sufficient energy in the advice which he had been instructed to give to M. Berger. M. Henry said that the whole incident bad been most regrettable, and that M. Constans had since then, and owing to mis apprehension on his part, been made fully aware of the views and intentions of the French, which were to act entirely with His Majesty’s Government and the Bussian Government in the question of the Bail way, to wait for some step by Germany soliciting the co-operation of France, and then to negotiate only with the knowledge and concurrence of England and Bussia, and on the basis of the internationalization of the Bailway between the four countries, with equal participation and rights in the enterprise to each. As to the alleged negotiations between the Deutsche Bank and French financiers, M. Henry told me, in addition to the information given to me by M. Louis, that M. Gwinner, the head of the Deutsche Bank, who frequently comes to Paris on business, was discussing about a year ago some question with a prominent French financier, when the latter asked what was being done in the matter of the Bagdad Bail way. M. Gwinner, who w^as somewdiat taken aback by the question, replied that nothing w as being done by his bank, but that it wmuld gladly accept the co-operation of French finance. To the further question as to the form in which such co-operation would be accepted, M. Gwinner had replied, “the investment of French capital at 4 per cent, on what would be excellent security.” The French financier, M. Henry said, had retorted, “ Vbus plaisantez done, M. Gwinner.” [2306 tf—l]According 1 to M. Henry there had been no sort of negotiation or pourparlers so far as the French Government or he knew, and he felt sure that none would take place without the knowledge and concurrence of the French Government, who would not give their concurrence without previous communication with His Majesty’s Government. M. Henry went on to say that all the information which he had made it evident him that the German parties interested in the Railway could not raise the fund; requisite for its continuation without coming to the Paris market. France was now the country to which gold kept flowing in, and were it not for the large investments made by the French abroad there would be such a plethora of gold in this country that there would he a general financial crisis all over the world. It had been calculated that every year there came into France 60,000,000/. in the shape of interest on investments abroad, and that 60,000,000/. were left in France by foreign tourists visiting Paris and other parts of the country, and chiefly the Riviera. It was necessary, in order to obviate a crisis, to send out again a great part of the gold thus accumulated. I suggested that the Bank of France might easily relieve itself of part of its surplus of gold by making its coin payments in gold instead of in gold and silver according to its choice. M. Henry replied that the large amount of gold kept by the Bank had its advantages, one of which was that whereas the bank rate at Berlin was now at 7 per cent, and at London 6 per cent, it was at Paris only 3 per cent., and this lower rate enabled profitable business to be done.

IN your despatch No 705 ot the 17th instant you forwarded to me a copy of a despatch from His Majesty s Ambassador at St. Petersburg!!, giving the views of the French Ambassador at that capital on the question of the participation of the Bussian Government in the Bagdad Bailway undertaking, and you stated that you would be glad if I could ascertain the nature of the negotiations which have passed between the Ottoman and Deutsche Banks. The French Ambassador stated to Sir A Nicolson that originally negotiations for the participation of the French banks in the enterprise had proceeded with the knowledge and approval of the French Government, but that the negotiations fell through on the question of the equality of French and German representation on the Board of Directors and in the Administrative Council. The Ottoman Bank had, however, continued the discussions on its own account, and without the knowledge of the French Government, who, M. Bompard believed, were now cognizant of the nature of those negotiations. In the course of the interview which I had with M. Auboyneau, the Administrator of the Ottoman Bank at Paris, on the 13th instant, which I had the honour to report to you in my despatch No. 505, Confidential, of that day, he referred to the negotia tions which had taken place between the Ottoman and the Deutsche Banks several months ago. He did not tell me the nature of those negotiations, but he replied in the affirmative to my inquiry whether they had fallen through owing to the refusal of the German Bank to give to the proposed French participators rights equivalent to the money to be provided by them. It was evident that he did not intend to disclose the particulars of the negotiations ; I therefore did not pursue the subject. I had intended to endeavour to obtain the information which you require from the Minister for Foreign Affairs yesterday, his receiving day, but he was summoned to a Cabinet Council at the Elysee before my turn came to be received by his Excel lency. I therefore called on M. Louis, the “ Directeur Politique.” I told M. Louis that I had wished to thank M. Pichon for having sent M. Auboyneau to see me, and that, as I had not been able to see his Excellency, I should be obliged if M. Louis would thank him on my part. I then gave him for perusal my despatch to you of the 13tli instant, and I said it was very regrettable that M. Berger had refused to act with his British colleague on the Council of the Debt, and that I could not help feeling that the French Ambassador at Constantinople had not thought fit to request M. Berger with sufficient insistence to concert with Mr. Block the attitude which they should both take up in regard to the surplus ceded re vermes, for otherwise it was strange that M. Berger should have disregarded the request of his Ambassador. The result was unfortunate, for there would be at the disposal of the Turkish Government, and consequently for the purposes of the Bagdad Bailway, revenues which Mr. Block had proposed should be ear-marked for the £ T. 250,000 to be provided for Macedonia. M. Louis did not repudiate the idea that M. Constans recommendation o M. Berger had not been very strong. I had given him the reason for my opinion, viz., M. Constans’ representation to M. Pichon that he had no authority to give or ers o the French Delegate on the Debt Council, and that, though always ready to carry out instructions from M. Pichon, he ventured to point out certain objections to M. Berger acting with Mr. Block in the particular question at issue. M. Louis said that it was much to be regretted that M. Berger had not seen fit to come to an agreement with Mr. Block; that the Ambassador certainly could not give him oiters, u 1 unusual for a person in the position of M. Berger not to accept the recommen ^ of his Ambassador, and pdrhaps M. Berger s objections o omg apparent to M. Constans than to us. He (M. Louis; said that ic q [2257 a?— 1 ]ceded revenues, and the effect or possible effect of the rote of the Debt Council on the prospect of security being consequently forthcoming for continuing t le Bagdad Railway was to him so complicated that he must confess that he could not understand what would be its result. M. Constans and M. Auboyneau were convinced that for the next three years to come there would be no surplus fiom the ceded le venues available for the railway, and it must he hoped that this would be the case. I then alluded to M. Auboyneau’s reference, in conversation with me, to the negotiations between the Ottoman and Deutsche Banks. I said that I had not liked to ask that gentleman questions on the subject of his bank s business negotiations, and I did not understand exactly what they had been and why they had been broken off. Could he (M. Louis) enlighten me ? M. Louis then gave me the following account ot what had taken place, so far as he was cognizant of the circumstances. In 1902 M. Delcasse was willing that the French and German banks should come to an understanding in regard to the Bagdad Railway, but only on lour conditions, viz., that there should be absolute equality between the French and German interests in the money to he provided, the administration (including voting power), the construction, and the exploitation of the railway. As the German parties were not prepared to agree to these conditions, 1VI. Delcasse insisted on the negotiations being dropped. There were also, M. Louis said, further reasons for discontinuing the negotiations, viz., the objection of the Russian Government to the construction of the railway, and the feeling in England against the undertaking being carried out by a Franco-German combination. Later on there had been negotiations between French, German, and English banks, but they had failed on account of the unwillingness of the German negotiators to concede to the French and English banks advantages in proportion to the money to be provided by them. I then asked M. Louis w r hether he could tell me anything about the negotiations of some months ago, which M. Auboyneau said had come to nothing. M. Louis replied that personally he did not know what those negotiations were. Possibly M. Henry might, but he doubted it. Whatever they might have been, both he and M. Henry felt confident from the assurances given by M. Auboyneau that negotiations would not be renewed by the Ottoman Bank without the acquiescence of the French Government. Of course it was possible for a bank to dispose of good securities without a quotation on the Bourse, which the French Government could prevent, but it was unlikely that a French bank would take such an extreme step as to bring out a loan in opposition to the expressed wishes of the Finance Minister. I reminded M. Louis that when the present French Government came into office a warning had been given to the French financial group supposed to be negotiating with the German bank that the Government were opposed to negotiations for providing French money for the railway. M. Louis observed that certainly there had been reports of negotiations, but that he did not think that there had been any serious steps taken. Probably there may have been pourparlers as to what might and could be done in certain circumstances. He did not believe that the French Government had been in any way concerned in the discussion, and he reminded me that during the whole period of M. Rouvier’s Government the relations between France and Germany, owing to the Moroccan difficulty, had been in a state which was not such as to make it likely that the French Government would be inclined to aid Germany in doing what would not have been agreeable to England. The question of providing funds for the Bagdad Railway may have been mentioned to M. Rouvier by French financiers, and he may have listened to their arguments in favour of the French banks joining in the enterprise. This would have been quite sufficient to give rise to the report that the French Government had been concerned in the negotiations, if such there had been. M. Louis concluded by stating that he himself had no information as to the negotiations of the Ottoman Bank, that he did not think that M. Pichon had, or M. Henry, who had been in personal communication with M. Auboyneau on behalf of M. Pichon, and he felt sure that no further negotiations would take place without the knowledge of the French Government, and consequently the knowledge of His Majesty’s Government. I have, &amp;c.

(No. 722. Secret.; Sir, , . , , ni , i . Foreign Office, December 29, 1906. THE French Ambassador called at this Office on the 14th instant, and gave his own personal views on the measures adopted by the Council of the Otioman Debt with regard to the hypothecation of certain of the surplus revenues to cover the deficits in the Macedonian Budgets. M. Gambon gave the following account of the action of the British and French Delegates on the Council of the Debt on that occasion : Mr. Block’s proposal for the hypothecation of the surplus tithes revenues and surplus ceded revenues for the pavment, up to £ T. 250,000 annually, of the Macedonian deficits, was accepted by the Council at their meeting on the 3rd instant. It was, however, too apparent that the ultimate object contemplated by this proposal was the diversion to other purposes of funds destined by the German Government to furnish further kilometric guarantees for the Bagdad Railway. Baron Marschall von Biberstein was not slow to appreciate the true significance of the measure, and lost no time in bringing pressure to bear on the Sublime Porte with a view to rendering it abortive. The result of these representations was that the Minister of Finance withdrew the adhesion whieh he had previously given to the proposal in question. The British and French Delegates thereupon concerted a second proposal, which was submitted to and accepted by the Minister of Finance, and was to be put forward at the next meeting of the Council. At this meeting, however, Mr. Block, without previous consultation with his French colleague, reverted to his own original proposal. M. Berger, feeling that he was already committed by his communication with the Minister of Finance to the last proposal upon which he had agreed with Mr. Block, found himself unable to support his British colleague in this unexpected move, with the result that the second proposal was agreed to, and Mr. Block left in a minority of one. M. Cambon was of opinion that Mr. Block should have previously consulted with his French colleague as to this change of attitude, and characterized his omission to do so as “ aussi incorrecte que maladroite.’ Your Excellency will observe that this version of the action of the British and French Delegates is one which has not previously been brought to the notice of His Majesty’s Government, as I was not aware that, as stated by M. Cambon, Mr. Block and M. Berger had originally been in agreement as to the solution which has now been given to this question by the Council of the Ottoman Debt. His Excellency went on to state that a proposal had been put foiward by the German Delegate on the Council for the conversion of the short-term loans into a long-term loan, to be guaranteed on the revenues from mines and foiests. Ihe proceeds of this loan had, M. Cambon assumed, been destined by the German Government to supply the necessary resources for the kilometrm guarantees 0:i: ^ ® Bagdad Railway. The proposal was, however, negatived, and his Excellency expressed it as his own personal opinion that the old revenues were pledged to such an extent, and for so many different objects, that it did not appear to him to be possi 3 e on i ize any portion of them for the requisite guarantees. His Excellency subsequently read aloud two telegrams, Ambassador at Constantinople to the Minister for Foreign , _ . +nof M. Pichon’s reply thereto. In the former, M. Constans expresse e opmion Bagdad Railway would be built, whether the French and English overnmen ^ it or not. The French Government, acting under the advice of their Amhassado ^ London, were making a great mistake in supporting His^ h + p r iti s h their hostility to the German schemes, which were prejudicia c ^ Y . ^ interests. Such support must necessarily be regarded by ennany i an q unfriendly disposition (“ malveillance ”) on the part of France ow would inevitably provoke trouble between the two countries. t u Ug M. Pichon’s reply to this telegram was couched m very energe ic [2257/-I] one from the French Affairs, and the other A 9 Uo cvSi If &amp; r* i ! r pointed out that French interests and French policy were deeply involved m any Bagdad Railway scheme, and that none would be satisfactory unless it combined the participation of France, England, and Russia. All other schemes must therefore be resisted to the utmost. M. Pichon added that, since the Anglo-French enten/e, England had on several occasions acted “ in a most friendly manner towards France, and tha^ it was the duty and policy of the French Government to meet the views of Hil Majesty’s Government as far as possible. On the other hand, the German Government had recently done everything in their power to be disagreeable to h ranee, and their actions and communications were the reverse of friendly. I am, &amp;c.

THE French Ambassador told me to-day that he had received a Memorandum from Pans giving an account of a conversation between you and M. Gambon in regard to tbe Bagdad Railway, and lie gathered from this communication that an impression prevailed m London that the Russian Government were interesting themselves actively with respect to a paitic ipation m the above enterprise. He inquired of me whether I had discussed the question with M. Isvolsky, and whether I had understood from the lattei that the Russian Goa eminent were anxious or ready to ]om m a participation ol the loin 1 oweis m the railway. I told 1VL Bompard that I had spoken with M. Isvolsky^ on the subject, and that I had been instructed to ascertain the views of the Russian Government. I read to him my despatch No.^746 of the 7th instant, and I said that from that report he would see that M. Isvolsky had no definite views on the question of participation, that some members of the Cabinet were still in doubts as to whether the Russian Government should participate in or facilitate the construction of the line, and that I was awaiting some particulars which might be of service to M. Isvolsky in examining the question. M. Bompard said that he was confident that among the members of the Russian Cabinet there was strong opposition to Russia participating in the scheme ; but that in any case there could, in his opinion, he no question of either Great Britain, France, or Russia participating until Germany had made some advances to them to do so. He did not see that the question of the Bagdad Railway was “ a Tordre du jour ” ; it was possible that the line would he carried through to Taurus and down to Alexandretta without foreign participation, hut it would be a matter of two or three years before the question of its further prolongation need be seriously entertained, and in the meantime there seemed to M. Bompard no urgent necessity for discussing the form in which other countries should take part in the enterprise. As the above appeared to me to be the personal views of M. Bompard, I did not discuss the question with him, and I would prefer to await the further instructions which I may receive from you on the question. I inquired of his Excellency whether the Ottoman Bank did not already possess a share in the undertaking. M. Bompard said that originally negotiations had proceeded with the knowledge and approval of the French Government between the Ottoman and the Deutsche Banks ; but on.account of a vigorous campaign conducted against France participating officially in the enterprise, and in view of the hostility of the Russian Government to the scheme, the negotiations fell through on the question of the equality of ^ French and German representation on the Board of Directors and in the Administrative Council. Tbe Ottoman Bank, however, continued the discussions on its own account, and without the knowledge of the French Government. The latter, he believed, were now cognizant of the nature of these negotiations, but they would not take official notice of them and as the Ottoman Bank was acting without the appioval of the Irench Government, the Deutsche Bank had exacted harder conditions than would otherwise have been the case. French opinion had now veered round, and there wns a movement in favour of internationalizing the line ; but he did not know m what shape this could be effected, and he repeated that the overtures for such an arrangement would have to. come in the first instance from the German Government.

GASTON AUBOYNEATJ, Administrator of the Imperial Ottoman Bank, called on me this evening by desire of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, with whom he had just had an interview, and expressed a wish to dispel certain misunderstandings that seemed to exist as to the position of the Ottoman Bank in Paris with regard to the recent action of the Delegate of the French Bondholders of the Ottoman Debt on the Council of the Debt, in opposing the suggestion of the British Delegate that for the provision of the £ T. 250,000 annually for Macedonia there should, in addition to the proposed hypothecation of the tithe surplus, be a second guarantee on the ceded revenues. M. Auboyneau went into some detail as to the position of the Bank and the Debt Council in regard to the negotiations on the proposal for an increase of Turkish Customs; but he said that he had come chiefly to clear himself of any suspicion of having acted against Anglo-French interests. He stated that, owing to the claims of the Ottoman Bank for temporary loans to the Turkish Government secured on the surplus ceded revenues, they will not be available for three years to come for Bagdad Bail way purposes. He pointed out that, even if the French Delegate had voted with his British colleague^ they would have been in a minority, inasmuch as the other Delegates— German, Austrian, Italian, and Turkish—would have outvoted them. It was, he said, important for the interests of the bondholders that the negotiations for the increase of 3 per cent, in the customs should not break down. M. Auboyneau stated that there could not be any doubt that Germany had a Secret Agreement with the Sultan for the eventual application of the surplus ceded revenues for the construction of the Bagdad Bailway, whether it was a written or a verbal undertaking on the part of the Sultan he did not know, but, as he had. ^hea y said, for three vears these revenues were blocked. The Ottoman Bank had had no negotiations on the subject with the Deutsche Bank nor with Mr. Gwinner for sever months past, nor would the bank take part in any negotiations without the knowledge of the French Government. The section of 200 kilom. through the laurus would, he said, be so costly that it would be necessary to construct on the same guarantee the two following sections, making 600 kilom. in all, so as to make the a,Ye . ia ^ e ex P^ n on the three sections less. He was certain that money could not e raise y eiJ ^ * for the construction of these three sections without foreign nancia ® P&gt; explained that the Ottoman Bank is only interested in the lai way m so ai as i a certain number of shares in the undertaking. - q1 , .wimo-c M.

Mr. G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received December 17.) (No. 802. Secret.) Sir, Constantinople, December 12 , 1906 I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith a record of a very interesting conversation regarding the Bagdad Bailway, which Mr. Braham, correspondent of the “ Times ” in Constantinople, has recently had with the German Ambassador. ' Baron von Marschall has always treated Mr. Braham with great confidence, and I do not doubt his Excellency intended that what he had said should be confidentially communicated to me. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) G. BABCLAY. Inclosure in No. 1 . Record of Conversation between the German Ambassador at Constantinople and Mr. Braham,.—[Communicated by Mr. Braham.) THE German Ambassador told me frankly and spontaneously this morning that he is determined to push on the construction of the next section of the Bagdad Bailway. He is confident that he will be able to secure the small revenue required as- guarantee, but whether this year or next year he cannot say. The Syndicate had wished to undertake the next two sections together; that Turkey had not money enough for that, and he was not going to press it. The Syndicate had even suggested leaving out the Taurus section on account of its difficulty and costliness, and continuing the line from Adana towards Aleppo. As a gentleman (“ anstandiger Mensch ”) he had put his foot down about this, and had insisted on the Taurus section being built and built alone, precisely on account of its costliness. “ It is said against us that we took the 54,000,000 fr. stock from the Turks,, and, having built with it a railway not costing anything like that sum, had put the rest in our pockets.” In order to put a stop to these attacks the large sums economized on the first section must go towards the expenses of the second, which would cost more than the equivalent of the 54,000,000 fr. stock to be received by the Company foi the construction. I reminded him that in the Company s ^ ailCe ' s ^® e ^ s ^j 31 economized and set aside as a special reserve was given as only a sum o^ 3, , i. He scoffed at this, and said that, although he did not know the exact figures, for the Company did not show him its private accounts, he did know that not more than wo- thirds of the 54 , 000,000 fr. bad been spent, and that none of this saving had been divided. Even the French bankers, who had tried their best, had not been able to get a penny of it. If the Taurus section were not taken in ban soon le money y ou he divided among the banks, the complaints of the Turks wou ie 3^® ^ j i Konieh-Eregli section, left without any near outlet to the sea, would remain as He^ went on to argue that the construction of the secouh^ «|(Lon, whidiwould make the first section worth something, could not affec oui in w j ieu ( ’ nce they did not begin before the neighbourhood of Mosu ^ poi ; than they were over the Taurus they might be in a bettei position to negu '•’EHES replied tliat I must i 7 -«-«S.‘S'S tile whole line without England “ Wir sind mcht solche Narren uni ge 0 en Baghdad Bahn bauen zu wollen.”[A] BAGDAD RAILWAY.

Isvolsky to-day that you desired to know in what form and in what manner the Russian Government proposed to. participate in the Bagdad Railway, so that we might be able to examine in what way we could associate ourselves with them. M. Isvolsk^ said that he had not yet studied the question fully, and he had not yet framed any definite opinion as to how the question should be approached. Was I, he asked, in a position to give him any suggestions ? I told him that I had no specific proposals to make to him, but I had been reading lately some papers on the subject, and I obsened that in the discussions which had taken place in 1902 between British and German financiers there seemed to be an idea of dividing the shares into equal portions with a corresponding representation, I presumed, on the Administration. His Excellency asked me if I could give him a Memorandum on these proposals, simply for his own information and guidance, so that he might have some basis to go upon when discussing the matter with his colleagues in the Cabinet, 1 told him that I could not do so without authority, and, indeed, I did not know' whether what was suggested in 1902 still held good. I would inquire of you whether I might be placed in a position to give him some information as to your views or of those of British financiers. I should be grateful if I could be furnished with a paper which I could communicate to M. Isvolsky which would be of assistance to him. I said that I understood that the Russian Government were now ready to participate in the project, and had desisted from their former opposition to it. His Excellency said that he personally was in favour of participation, but that on the part of some of his colleagues there w^ere still doubts and hesitations. He added that formerly there was a practice for one Ministry to take a decision which would be subsequently counteracted by the steps adopted by another Ministry, and this system, or want of system, led to endless confusion, especially in international affairs. Perhaps, he observed with a smile, my Embassy had had some experience of this want of unity among the several Ministries. Now' a new departure had been taken, and any question of foreign or general policy was discussed and decided upon by the Cabinet as a whole- I asked him if during his visit in Paris he had ascertained what view the French Government took in regard to the Bagdad Railway. His Excellency said that M. Bour geois had told him that he was of opinion that all the four Powers, and not only three as hitherto, should arrive at a common understanding. Russia, as I knew’, had hitherto held aloof, and this had prevented France from deciding upon her course of action. Hehopecl now that we all should be agreed, and, so far as I could judge, he did not seem to anticipate anv great difficulty in persuading his doubtful colleagues to consent to taking part in common action.

(No. 74. Confidential.) Sir, Bagdad, August 25, 1906. I HAVE the honour to offer, for your Excellency’s information, a few remarks on of Irak may be split up and hostile to each other, hut many of them are still strong enough to keep the avarice of the Turkish officials within bounds, and the tribal system is a living organization which cannot be ignored. 2. It is not my intention to attempt to deal with the international problems which have been raised by the proposal to construct the Bagdad Railway : this is a task for which I am in no way competent. At the same time it may perhaps be of interest to your Excellency to have a somewhat detailed forecast, written by a man who has for some years been in charge of a wild district on the Indian frontier in which a railway runs through tribal lands, where water is precious, showing how in practice the influence of the Power making the railway will and must extend to the tribes through whose limits it passes. 6. The Arab tribes, at any rate between Bussorah and Bagdad, have by no means fully accepted Turkish rule, which they hate, and the Arab Sheikhs are quite sufficiently sensible to see that a Turkish railway will weaken their own position; consequently it may fairly be assumed that they either have to he coerced or cajoled into refraining from active resistance. Thus, before even a detailed survey can be made, some practical negotiation will have to be carried on with the tribes through whose limits the line passes. The Arabs will not trust to Turkish promises, and the Power most interested will inevitably be concerned with the negotiations, and will have, either directly or indirectly, to guarantee the good faith of the Turkish ollicials. Without the aid of a foreign Power, the Turks could only make the railway under military protection. 4. During construction large bodies of labourers would have to be employed. The foreign officials would be brought in close touch with the local labourers and with the non-labouring population of the district, through disputes and crimes in which the latter were concerned. . ... are certain to arise, and which will bring the railway officials in close touch with tiie people of the country. I will give a few examples of what I mean. Without the Euphrates and the Tigris, Mesopotamia could never be anything but a desert, at the same time these rivers will offer formidable dangers to railway engineers. is obvious that the railway engineers would require to control the y eie ^ approached bridges, but it seems to me that they might claim the ng i o muc i [2189 /Al] B BAGDAD RAILWAY.

Inclosure 1 in No. 1. Acting Consul-General Ramsay to Sir N. O'Conor. the local influence that is likely to he acquired by the Power which makes and maintains a railway in this exceedingly unsettled portion of the Sultan’s dominions. The tribes 5. Supposing the railway to be completed, there are a number of questions whichmore extended interference. The tracing which I inclose* shows_ how the River Tigris above Kut-el-Amarah appears to have altered its course in recent years, accord in to the best maps available. It is a well-known fact tba tie Euphrates has forsaken its old bed altogether from a point near Museyib, and that what is now the Euphrates below that point was orgmally a small canal. Surely with these facts before them, the managers of a great railway would be able to justify a claim to superintend the banks of the rivers, and to have a voice in granting or refusing permission even for canals made according to Arab methods. 11ms the foreigners would plav a very important part in controlling the source of nearly all wealth in the countrv, and they would get unrivalled opportunities foi picpaiing irrigation schemes of* their own.* There are many minor questions, too, concerning water that would bring the railway officials in close touch with the owners of the soil. In many places it would probably suit the Arabs to allow the annual inundations to take their natural course, but this might not suit the railway officials. Disputes would certainly rise about waterways under the railway. As the railways brings^ prosperity and provides a market for agricultural produce the area under cultivation will spread, and this will mean a demand for increased facilities for passing irrigation water under the line. Building materials for railway bridges and culverts will he expensive, and foundutions will have to be deep. Consequently a Sheikh who may want to improve his canal will find it worth his while to keep on good terms with the raihvav officials. If liver water is used, and there appears to be no other available, the railway officials must either be the owners of long channels under their own control, or they must become sharers with the tribesmen in channels common to both. In either case there will constantly be disputes about division of water, theft of water, or cost of cleaning and guarding the channels. 6. Butting aside questions immediately concerning the land and water, there are a number of 'other matters which will bring the railway officials into daily contact with the people. The line will have to be guarded along its whole length, and guards will have to be provided at small stations. It is of course conceivable that this work might be done by Turkish soldiers, but it Avill probably be found much cheaper and more effective to employ men supplied by the local Sheikhs. This would at once bring the local Sheikhs and railway officials into close relations. The line will also be maintained by gangmen, who must be recruited from local labour. At first, at any rate, people will be damaged by trains, and cattle trespassing on the line will be run over. Here again disputes will arise between the railway officials and the people. 7. There are other less direct ways in which the railway officials must become closely connected with local politics and interests. The railway will be the one unrivalled route to the shrines of Xedjef and Karbala, which are the centre of the Shiah religious world, and it Avill also bring a large number of Sunni pilgrims to the shrine of Sheikh Abdul Kadir at Bagdad. This must tend to increase the influence of the nation managing the railway. The railway officials will certainly turn their attention to obtaining some local fuel, whether they find coal or petroleum, or have forests, as is customary along the banks of the Indus, their influence, or rather that of the Bower under whose protec tion they work, will increase in proportion to their local expenses, which must in any case amount to a very large figure. 8. There are several other local peculiarities, probably not thought of in England, which will bring the railway officials into contact with ‘the local tribesmen. As an instance of one, I may mention the recent attack on the British steamer “ Khalifah,’ , near Amarah, on the Tigris. Xo one here supposes that this was prompted by any desire to harm the British Government or British officials or subjects ; the sole object ot the Arabs was to force attention to their case (which they did with great success), and the railway would afford as good a means for political measures of this sort as did the “ Khalifah.” I he Bower managing the railway would certainly make its influence felt if the railway was attacked in similar circumstances. The other local peculiarity to be considered is the blood feud, and this will continue to exist for many years to come, if the experience of the Indian Government on the north-western frontier of India affords any sound basis for a conclusion. A life lor a life is the law of the blood feud. Even if the European officials of the railway avoid liability to this law, which, according to local opinion, is very doubtful, there would be difficulty in obtaining any This section was taken purely by chance. Alarge number of labourers who were free from its penalties and obligations. Isolated railway employes would fall easy victims, and the railway officials would he forced to interfere for the protection of their servants. 9. So far I have only attempted to show how the railway officials would be forced to spread their influence among the people of the soil. It may perhaps be interesting to examine the causes that would oblige them to increase their influence with the local Turkish officials and with the population of the towns. 10. The attitude of the Turkish Government towards the British Bepresentative at Bagdad is one of the utmost suspicion. Scarcely any Turkish subject would dare to be seen inside the Besidency, and certainly no conspicuous Arab or military officer. In these circumstances, it is difficult for the British Government’s Bepresentative to have any close and first-hand knowledge of what is going on in the country, and it is quite impossible for him to have any personal influence which might be used in an : emergency. With the Power owning the railway this kind of boycott would be impossible, and consequently that Power would have at its disposal a very considerable force of personal influence, which is a most valuable asset in the East in time of trouble as well as in time of peace. iSot only would the railway officials have unrivalled sources of information, they would also be in daily contact with the Turkish officials, who would have the decision of the hundred and one little disputes and difficulties that arise in connection with any large business undertaking. Traders and shopkeepers would be likely to follow their national railway, and they would find it suited them to be zealous supporters of their nation and its trade. Hospitals and schools would also probably be opened. 11. I trust that I may be excused for intruding my opinion on a subject which has been fully discussed by some of the ablest men in Europe. Mj excuse must be the possibility that it has not been examined from the point of view of a man who has spent some years in directly administering a district populated by fanatical Mahommedan tribes. My experience leads me to think that the Power which makes and manages the Bagdad Bailway will, where it runs through the unsettled country of Mesopotamia, inevitably obtain a commanding influence both with the Turks and the tribesmen. If it suits the Power concerned to become the de facto ruler of the country, I can see nothing to prevent it from attaining that position. 12. As the value of my arguments entirely depends upon the accuracy ot my statement that there is no properly-established Government able to keep the tribes in order and that the tribes must therefore be treated as having eftective political power, I inclose a Memorandum, which is not perhaps complete, showing the local disturbances that have been reported by this Consulate-General since , anuaiy I have, &amp;c.

It ended, however, in most of the troops, including the Kol Aghassi, being massacred. December 17, 1903.—In connection with the above incident the Bussorah Consul reports the arrival at Zubeir of Muhammad Pasha Daghastani with 1,200 men. He also reported that, previous to the arrival of the troops, a party of the Muntafik had raided a village on the outskirts of Bussorah and carried off cattle and camels. The result was a panic in Bussorah, and shops and houses were closed. December 28, 1903.—Bussorah Consul reports arrival of a battalion from Hillah, and 100 reserves from Amarah.

(117,649/. in 1904), an increase of 21,175/., or about 20*55 per cent. The receipts per mile rose from 425/= in 1904 to 513/. in 1905. The small branch line from Hamidie to Ada Bazar (less than 6 miles) is the only part of the line which shows a falling off in gross receipts. They amounted in 1905 to 4,307/. (4,712/. in 1904), a decrease, of 405/. or 8*59 per cent. The receipts per mile on this branch fell from about 842/. in 1904 to 770/. in 1905. The total gross receipts for the whole system amounted, therefore, to 431,979/. (365,034/. in 1904) 5 an increase of 66,945/., or at the rate of 18*34 per cent. The increase or decrease of gross receipts per mile from different kinds of traffic is shown in the following table :— Konia Ada Bazar Angoi •a nine. Extension. Branch. f s. d. f s. d. £ s. d.

This new service accounts for an increase of about 300,000 passengers. The remainder of [2094 s—2] * Not printed.— gte£i£::*y*l, Jil— the main line would probably also have shown an increase of passenger traffic had it not been fOT the police restrictions decreed m consequence of the attempt on the life of His Maiestv the Sultan.

Extraordinary expenditure amounting to 7,1344 was also incurred (partly for agricultural purposes), and was defrayed from revenue. The interest on the “Renewal Fund,” amounting to 9,707/., was again added to capital, together with a further dotation of 8,000/. from general revenue, so that the total addition to this fund for the year amounts to 17,707/. Kilometric Guarantee .—The sums paid to the Company by the Ottoman Govern ment on account of kilometric guarantee for the year 1905 amounted for the Haidar Pasha-Angora line to 41,564/., and for the liski Shehir-Konia extension to 101,641. These sums were paid in full by the Administration of the Public Debt in January 1906. The gross receipts of the Eski Shehir-Konia hue exceeded for the first time the minimum of 446/. per mile contemplated by the Concession, so that the Govern ment no longer paid the maximum of 118,982/. as kilometric guarantee, but 17,341/. less. Rolling-stock.— At the end of 1905 the rolling-stock of the Company con sisted of:— Tender engines 18 Engines with separate tenders 61 Reserve tenders 3 Snow ploughs 3 Four-wheeled passenger coaches 213 Eight-wheeled passenger coaches 26 Four-wheeled luggage vans .. 37 Eight-wheeled luggage and mail vans .. 4 Goods trucks and waggons .. .. 1,376 There have also been ordered three further tender-engines for passenger trains, and one large engine for goods trains.~—nw 3 Finance .—The following alterations have taken place in the financial position of the Company:— (a.) The redemption of debentures has proceeded regularly according to the programme of amortization. The debenture capital, which originally amounted to 6,400,000/. nominal, had been reduced on the 31st December, 1905, to 6,343,000/. v } ‘) a ccordance with the Resolution of the general meeting held on the ▼ 30th June, 19(15, and with Article 37 of the Articles of Association, fourteen fully paid-up shares and eighty-six shares on which 60 per cent, had been paid up were redeemed by lot at a net cost of 1,312/., and “ bons de jouissance ” issued in their place. 1 le toted number of redeemed shares on the 31st December, 1905, was 894, of a nominal value of 17,880/. ( c ') raking advantage of the right conferred by the general meeting on the 25th June, 1903, the Deutsche Bank has taken up the 15,000 shares (Nos. 120,001 to R&gt;5,000) which were held in reserve. On these shares the bank has paid up 60 per cent., thereby increasing the share capital of the Company by 180,000/. idle repayment ot the advance made to the Ministry of Marine on the /th June, 1902, has been continued according to contract. On the 31st December, 190o, the Company’s claim still amounted to 137,013/. Division of Profits. The available surplus from profit and loss account (including balance from 1901) amounted to 116,676/. It was proposed to divide this sum as follows : — Regular reserve fund 5 per cent, interest on paid-up share capital .. .* ] * Redemption of shares Directors’ percentage (“ tantieme ”) .. 1 per cent, superdividend on 119.106 shares and 894 “bons de jouYssance” Balance to next account Total These proposals give the shareholders for the first time a dividend of 6 per cent. Management and Board of Directors. —Dr. Zander, who has been General Manager of the Company since 1897, has resigned in order to return to Berlin, where he will continue, however, to act as “ Administrateur-Delegue.” He has been replaced by M. E. Huguenin, who has been appointed General Manager and Delegate of the Board of Directors at Constantinople. On the 31st December, 1905, the Board of Directors was constituted as follows :— Arthur Gwinner, Director of the Deutsche Bank, Chairman. K. Schrader, Member of the Reichstag, &amp;c., Vice-Chairman in Berlin. C. Testa, Delegate of the German Bondholders on the Council of the Ottoman Public Debt, Vice-Chairman in Constantinople. L.

The Bussian Minister of Pinance is personally opposed to the participation of Bussia in the project, and, as far as I can gather, M. Bompard, who has had an interview with him, did not succeed in overcoming his scruples. I think, however, that unless I tell M. Bompard that, according to our information, Germany does not at present contemplate the extension of the line to Bagdad, and that 1 myself have received instructions not to press the Bussian Government, his Excellency will continue to urge them to take part in the project. The visit to Paris of the Director of the Deutsche Bank looks, at the same time, as though Germany desired to obtain the support of Prance. The hesitations of the Bussian Government will take some time to overcome, and I fear I should cause some confusion if I ceased discussing the question with the Minister for Poreign Affairs and held back my Prench colleague. In the circumstances, therefore, you would perhaps prefer that I should continue to act with M. Bompard. [2038 s~2]■&lt; xc i / et Form. E.

The Committee consider that it is most undesir- -able, from the military and commercial point of view, that the Baghdad Railway should be completed and controlled by a foreign Power or Powers. Having regard to British interests, the best arrangement appears to be that the section from Baghdad to the Persian Gulf should be under a British Manager, subject to the general control of an international Board.

To The Right Hon’ble JOHN MORLEY, O.M., Sis Majesty's Secretary of State for India, 1 l y (kiih') Simla, the 12th July 1905. Sir, We have the honour to address you on the subject of the Anatolian Railway to Baghdad and the Persian Gulf with special reference to the effect which its construction may be expected to have upon Indian interests in the middle east and particularly in Persia and the Persian Gulf. 2. In paragraph 2 of our Secret Frontier Despatch No. 27 of 1904, we premised that it was an accepted principle with His Majesty’s Government that, should the line ever be continued south of Baghdad, this could not be done without British co-operation and consent; and that no terminal port could be selected unless a similar consent had been obtained, and unless the port were made open and international in character. In paragraph 2 of our Secret External Despatch No. 25, dated the 4th of February 1904, we referred to a telegram from Eord George Hamilton, dated 26th March 1902, in which it was stated that the assistance of His Majesty’s Government with regard to the prolongation of the Baghdad Railway to the Persian Gulf would be conditional upon British capital receiving, in respect of construction, materials, and management, at least equal shares with any other Power. 3 We have not hitherto offered our detailed opinion upon the matter because, from the information available to us, the prosecution of ^ the scheme appeared to be obstructed by two barriers which could not be raised without the assistance and co-operation of His Majesty’s Government. We understood that the promoters of the scheme would find it difficult to raise capital for more than the first few sections of the line, and that for the remainder funds would have to be provided by enhancement of the Customs revenues which would require the consent of the Powers including that of Great Britain. It seemed likely therefore that, apart from political considerations, purely financial needs would compel the Company sooner or later to commence negotiations with a view to the co-operation of His Majesty s Government. Again, although the point where the line would terminate on the shore of the” Persian Gulf had been left undecided, and is still not settled, yet it seemed most probable that the terminus to be selected won d be either at or near Koweit which is under our special control or on the Khor Abd la, on the confines of Koweit territory, over against the island of Bubiyan. We have in our despatch No. 25, dated 4th February 1904, submitted proposals for the vindication of Sheikh Mubarak’s rights to this island and we conceived that the existence of important British interests in this locality would tend to postpone the acquisition of any outlet for the railway in ^ersian waters until the consent and approval of His Majesty’s Government had been sought and obtained. V,In view of the Indian interests at stake, we felt sure that His Majesty’s Government would not be likely to formulate auy decision in regard to these two matters, should discussion of the subject at any time take a practical form, without consulting the Government of India, and we therefore abstained from presenting our views on the question until a suitable opportunity should occur. From information which has recently been furnished to us by His Majesty’s Government, however, we see grave reason for apprehending that the safeguards upon which we relied as a natural bulwark for our interests are about to melt away leaving us isolated and. exposed to all the dangers which might be expected to result from the independent con struction of the railway by our political rivals. In the first place, Sir N. O’Conor in his despatch No. 249 (Confidential), to Sir E. Grey, dated the 12th April 1906, stated that it was improbable that the Germans, if they once surmounted the difficulties, financial and other, attending the con struction of the line through the Taurus range, and reached the open plain beyond it, would be willing to permit the participation of the British Government in the scheme on favourable terms. His Excellency added that, if the Germans were unable to obtain assistance for the Taurus section, they might find themselves forced to seek another combination involving less expenditure by avoiding the mountains, and by constructing a line from Eregli, or from some point west of Eregli direct to Mersina, whence by utilising the existing Mersina-Adana railway the line could be continued east wards on the route originally planned. The fact that the Germans have recently obtained a controlling interest in the Mersina-Adana line is an ominous indication of the likelihood of the Company adopting the course foreshadowed by Sir N. O’Conor. By this move not only have the Germans carried out the condition of the contract requiring them to construct a line to the Mediterra nean, but they have also secured a means of transporting material, rolling stock, &amp;c., which will enable them to push on the construction of the line to Baghdad without having to wait for the piercing of the Taurus. Also, although by the Baghdad Bail way Convention it is agreed that the Baghdad- Basrah section shall not be exploited until the whole of the trunk line is completed, yet this clause does not preclude the building and working of other sections, and there is therefore nothing to prevent the Germans from building and exploiting the whole of the line between Adana and Baghdad. Adana could then be linked, if necessary, with Eregli when sufficient money had been laid aside from loans and profits on construction of the Baghdad-Adana sec tions to overcome the difficulties of the mountain range. 5. But apart from the fact that German ingenuity has suggested a method of evading, if not of solving the problem of the Cilician Gates, it •Enclosure to despatch from sir n. O’Conor to appears probable from Mr. Mark Sykes sir Edward Grey, No. 187 , dated the 20th March Memorandum* of 1st March 1906, that 1006 ' German influence and German manipul ation of Ottoman finance may enable the Company eventually to surmount alone the financial difficulties which were at one time held likely to bar the completion of the line by them without our assistance. On the whole it seems probable that, if our participation in the scheme is much longer delayed, we shall be unable to rely on the pecuniary embarrassment of the Company as a factor in the situation inducing them to seek our assistance. 6. In the second place, we are disposed to doubt whether our position with reference to the question of a terminus for the railway is as strong as we were previously inclined to believe. It appears to have been the original intention of the concessionaires that the line should terminate at a port on or near the open sea, and some spot in the neighbourhood of Koweit appeared to be indicated at first as a likely terminus. The financiers controlling the syndic cate seem, however, to have cast about for the means of making themselves independent of British assistance in the matter, and from the report of Captain Mahon who was specially deputed last year to make an examination of all possible termini, there would appear to be no reason w r hy they should not succeed in attaining their object. Captain Mahon is of opinion that there are no engineering difficulties which would prevent Basrah from being made the terminus of the line, and he thinks that it would provide a port capableof accommodating steamers fully equal to the demands of trade for many years to come. He further points out that from a commercial point of view Basrah offers advantages over all possible termini. His opinion as to the feasibility of dredging the bar of the Shatt-el-Arab is supported by His Excel lency the Naval Commander-in-Chief and by the officers of the British India Steam Navigation Company who ply in those waters. Mr. Grant Duff’s recent # Telegram to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for report* of German attempts to pur- Foreign Affairs, dated the 9th May 1906. chase from Persia a concession for a port and a coaling station at the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab is not without significance. We are still disposed to think that the best terminus is to be found in the neighbourhood of the Khor Abdulla or of Kathama Bay. But we recognise that a suitable port may, if necessary, be secured at some point less directly subject to British influence. 7. In these circumstances, though our opinion on the subject has not been invited by His Majesty’s Government, we think it desirable that we should place you in possession of our views as to the advantages to be secured by participation in the scheme and as to the dangers to be feared, in the event of the project being completed without reference to British claims. The authoritative statements in regard to the detrimental effects likely to be produced upon British interests by a railway on the alignment proposed, if under the exclusive control of a great military* and industrial nation, have been summarised in Part Y of Mr. Alwyn Parker’s Memorandum, dated the 10th of March 1906. His Majesty’s Government have no doubt considered these statements and the conclusions arrived at in them, but even at the risk of recapitulating arguments, with which His Majesty’s Government are already familiar, we think it as well on the present occasion to lay stress on some considerations of both local and general importance, with which the Govern ment of India regard themselves as intimately concerned. 8. At Baghdad we have had a Resident since 1766. Kerbala and Nejef are annually visited by large numbers of Indian pilgrims. At Basrah there is a British Consul, who is charged with the care of British trade which is represented by 81-05 per cent of the shipping coming into the port, and by the Tigris and Euphrates Steam Navigation Company who are the principal carriers of merchandise between Basrah and Baghdad, and who are subsidised by the Indian Government. At Koweit for some years past we have been steadily endeavouring to consolidate our influence in anticipation of the day when the ' port of a trans-continental railway system should be located in this neighbour hood. Lately we have, with the approval of His Majesty’s Government, sent a British Political Agent to reside at this port and have authorised the Sheikh to adopt a distinctive flag. The Baghdad-Khanikin route is the line by which a very substantial share of British trade with Persia passes. 9. The Germans have already clearly shown that they have no intention of confining their energies to the mere construction of a through line of rail. The Convention itself gives them the right to construct a branchf from Sadijeh to Khanikin, to establish | various industries, to construct§ quays at the terminal port, to utilise|| such natural water power as may be avail able, and during construction to run^j* steamers on the Tigris. Schemes have also been started by German com mercial associations for the exploitation of the mineral wealth of the country traversed by the railway. Nor do they intend to restrict their activity to Meso potamia only. In 1897, they appointed, for the first time, a Consul to reside at Bushire, where their commercial interests are still of the most slender *• Sir N.o'Coaor to Sir Edward a« y&gt; No. 246, description; while in Mesopotamia they dated the nth April 1906. recently posted** a Vice-Consul at Mosul ostensibly for the purpose of looking after the affairs of the German Scientific Mission to Kela Shergat and Babylon. His Majesty’s Consul-General at Baghdad has expressed the opinion that the real object of the so-called Scientific Mission is the collection of information and the dissemination of German influence in connection with the construction of the Baghdad Railway. t Article I. J Article XXII. § Article XXIII. j| Article XXV. ^ Article IX.i i Mil n I i/ tlvi'isy (Z^U/ob) ■&gt; ! t 4 A scheme has even been mentioned for starting at Bahrein a banking business under the auspices of the Deutsche Bank and the German Consul at Bushire has more than once made special inquiries as to the status of German subjects trading at this port and their claims to German Consular representation. 10. Further, we recently learnt from Mr. Spring-Bice^ letter No. 215 (Confidential), to Sir E. Grey, dated 28th March 1906, that there was reason to suppose that the mission of the newly-appointed German Minister to Persia was not unconnected with a project for linking up the Baghdad Bail way with Persia by means of a road via Khanikin. Mr. Spring-Bice pointed out that, in the event of this concession being granted, and in the event of the revival of a concession which the Germans formerly possessed for the construction of a road from Khanikin to Kermanshah, the Germans would control the pilgrim route to Kerbala which is the only line in Persia which is certain to pav. We have also learnt that the German Diplomatic representatives have been taking an unusual interest in the progress of the boundary dispute between Turkey and Persia, and it is obvious that the acquisition by Turkey of a considerable slice of the mountainous country which bounds Mesopotamia on the east would tend greatly to strengthen the position of the power holding the plains of the Euphrates and Tigris. Again, the grant of a road concesssion from Baghdad to Kermanshah would imperil the chances of a com bination of England, France, and Bussia for participation in the scheme, as it would be very difficult then to reconcile the conflicting interests by a scheme which would do justice to the claims of all parties concerned. The conflict between German and British interests in and around the Gulf was, however, fully discussed in the despatch from the Government of India, No. 27 (Frontier), dated the 4th February 1904, and it has again been referred to in our Secret-External despatch No/97, dated the 12th July 1906. The arrival of a German railway at Basrah, Um Kasr, Koweit, or any other point in this quarter must tend to the Germanisation of the Baghdad and Basrah Wilayets, the diminution of British prestige and commerce in these provinces, and the disturbance of our relations with the Arab Chiefs on the southern and western shores of the Gulf; it would react on our position in Persia, and would possibly, if indeed not probably, necessitate a considerable increase to the British naval forces which at present are stationed in these waters. 11. Apart from the disturbance of our commercial and political position, it is difficult to believe that a trans-continental railway terminating on the Gulf would not sooner or later bring with it the construction of fortifications such as those which guarded the maritime termini of the trans-Siberian Bail way. The manner in which any such result would be viewed by His Majesty’s Government has been clearly indicated by various formal utterances. In August 1902, at an interview with the Shah, Eord Eansdowne informed His Majesty that “our special concern was of course with the southern part of Peisia and with the Persian Gulf, and we should, if occasion arose, put forth the whole of our strength in order to prevent encroachments by other Powers in these regions”; and again on the 5th May 1903 His Lordship declared in the House of Lords:—“ In the third place-I say it without hesitation—we should regard the establishment of a naval base or of a fortified port in the Persian Gulf by any other Power as a very grave menace to British interests, and we should certainly resist it with all the means at our disposal ”. 12. But^a^ng^Jdorhori^on, it appears to us certain that German statesmen, relyihp^Th^hll-foundedbelief that the line will prove to be a valuable commercial speculation, intend to use it as a means for the prosecu tion ot their ambitions in the near and middle east. Sir N. O’Conor reported in his Tetter to Sir E. Grey, dated 17th April 1906, that the President of the Anatolian and Baghdad Bail way Companies had succeeded in obtaining a promise _ from the iSultan of a concession for a scheme of irrigation ic non P am . 0 K° m a by draining the marshy area extending to some 16,000 acres in the neighbourhood of Karavha, a project which the Ger mans have had in view for some time past. Other similar schemes may he expected to make their appearance m due course. Further, we may tale it lor granted that the Germans fully realise that the great risk to the future ot the line lies in the misgovernment and disorder of the districts n,through which it passes, and they are doubtless prepared to take the measures which will he required in order to ensure the maintenance of law and order in those districts. t We anticipate that when once definite construction has commenced, a more or less gradual process of interference by Germany will ensue in the administration of those portions of the Turkish Empire through which the railway will pass. In time this process can have but one result, namely, the consolidation of German influence throughout this vast and important territory and the eventual passing into German hands of all real power in this particular zone. Eor the maintenance of order local forces, doubtless officered and controlled by Germany at the expense of Turkey, would have to he kept up, and in this connection, the political importance of the existing Haidar Tasha-Eregli line merits serious attention. By means of this line the greater part of Anatolia is brought within the German sphere of influence and the Osmanli inhabitants of this region, who are capable of being converted into fighting material of unrivalled value, would doubtless form the basis of the forces which would be recruited for the purpose of maintaining order. The rapid extension of the Hedjaz railway and its linking up with the Baghdad line would enable the Turkish troops to be concentrated either on the western or eastern frontiers of the Sultan’s dominions, and our position in Egypt and at Aden and even the Bed Sea route to India would be threatened, wlnle it would be more difficult for the Arabs to make head against the power of the Porte. 13. The Government of India cannot regard with equanimity the possible creation of a situation such as that sketcHedr^hOTeT - Wflh the Concentration of so much power in German hands, and with the shadow of an eventual Busso-German alliance looming in the distance, there would be ground for serious apprehension and a large increase to the military expenditure of the United Kingdom would be inevitable. 14. These considerations have led us to the opinion that in the interests of India it is necessary that we should no longer confine ourselves to an attitude of passivFexpectation in the hope that the progress of the line may be stopped by natural, political, or financial obstacles ; that it is hopeless to attempt to block the scheme by any action within our power ; and that it is therefore obligatory to secure such an interest in the undertaking as may minimize the risks of its falling under the control of a single power or being utilised as a means of overthrowing our present predominant position in the Gulf and of menacing India. 15. His Majesty’s Government have no doubt already considered in what manner a share in this great enterprise may be secured, if this is still prac ticable* In time of peace, the control of the south-eastern portion of the line would materially add to our prestige in the Gulf. In the event of future war, however, it would certainly not provide us with a guarantee of protection while, on the other hand, there w'ould be nothing to prevent our particular section from being used by our enemies at their will. In our opinion our interests can be most effectively safeguarded by some arrangement that will enable the British Gov ernment to take part in the scheme as a whole. By the adoption of such a couise we should, among other things, pave the way for^the employment of British officers for the maintenance of order, and the pre-eminent faculty which Englishmen possess for the management of Asiatics^ might be expected soon to secure for us the predominant share of these duties in the regions traversed by the line. It has been proved again and again that Englishmen can work in climates where Germans can barely exist, and we have the great advantage of being able to draw on India for cheap militaiy material. 16. We would, therefore, in the event of no decision having as yet been arrived at on the subject of British participation in the Bailway, venture strongly to recommend that every effort should be made to obtain the largest possible share in the whole project from Eregli onwards. As an alternative, but only in the event of this proving impracticable, we would advocate that** * control of the Baghdad-Basrah Gulf Section and of the port upon the Gulf should be secured for the British Government.

To The Right Hon’ble JOHN MORLEY, O.M., His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, Simla, the 12th July 1906, Sir, We have the honour to address you on the subject of the Anatolian Railway to Baghdad and the Persian Gulf with special reference to the effect which its construction may he expected to have upon Indian interests in the middle east and particularly in Persia and the Persian Gulf. 2. In paragraph 2 of our Secret Frontier Despatch No. 27 of 1904, we premised that it was an accepted principle with His Majesty’s Government that, should the line ever be continued south of Baghdad, this could not be done without British co-operation and consent; and that no terminal port could be selected unless a similar consent had been obtained, and unless the port were made open and international in character. In paragraph 2 of our Secret External Despatch No. 25, dated the 4th of February 1904, we referred to a telegram from Lord George Hamilton, dated 26th March 1902, in which it was stated that the assistance of His Majesty’s Government with regard to the prolongation of the Baghdad Railway to the Persian Gulf would be conditional upon British capital receiving, in respect of construction, materials, and management, at least equal shares with any other Power. 3. We have not hitherto offered our detailed opinion upon the matter because, from the information available to us, the prosecution of the scheme appeared to be obstructed by two barriers which could not be raised without the assistance and co-operation of His Majesty’s Government. We understood that the promoters of the scheme would find it difficult to raise capital for more than the first few sections of the line, and that for the remainder funds would have to be provided by enhancement of the Customs revenues which would require the consent of the Powers including that of Great Britain. It seemed likely therefore that, apart from political considerations, purely financial needs would compel the Company sooner or later to commence negotiations with a view to the co-operation of His Majesty’s Government. Again, although the point where the line would terminate on the shore of the Persian Gulf had been left undecided, and is still not settled, yet it seemed most probable that the terminus to be selected would be either at or near Koweit which is under our special control or^ on the Khor Abdulla, on the confines of Kuweit territory, over against the island of Bubiyan. TVe have in our despatch No. 25, dated 4th February 1904, submitted proposals for the vindication of Sheikh Mubarak’s rights to this island, and we conceived that the existence of important British interests in this locality would tend to postpone the acquisition of any outlet for the railway in Persian waters untii the consent and approval of His Majesty’s Government had been sought and obtained.3 2 - In view of the Indian interests at stake, we felt sure that His Majesty’s Government would not be likely to formulate any decision in regard to these two matters, should discussion of the subject at any time take a practical form, without consulting the Government of India, and we therefore abstained from presenting our views on the question until a suitable opportunity should occur. 4. Prom information which has recently been furnished to us by His Majesty’s Government, however, we see grave reason for apprehending that the safeguards upon which we relied as a natural bulwark for our interests are about to melt away leaving us isolated and exposed to all the dangers which might be expected to result from the independent con struction of the railway b^ our political rivals. In the first place, Sir N. O’Conor in his despatch No. 249 (Confidential), to Sir E. Grey, dated the 12th April 190fi, stated that it was improbable that the Germans, if they once surmounted the difficulties, financial and other, attending the con struction of the line through the Taurus range, and reached the open plain beyond it, would be willing to permit the participation of the British Government in the scheme on favourable terms. His Excellency added that, if the Germans were unable to obtain assistance for the Taurus section, they might find themselves forced to seek another combination involving less expenditure by avoiding the mountains, and by constructing a line from Eregli, or from some point west of Eregli direct to Mersina, whence by utilising the existing Mersina-Adana railway the line could be continued east wards on the route originally planned. The fact that the Germans have recently obtained a controlling interest in the Mersina-Adana line is an ominous indication of the likelihood of the Company adopting the course foreshadowed by Sir N. O’Conor. By this move not only have the Germans carried out the condition of the contract requiring them to construct a line to the Mediterra nean, but they have also secured a means of transporting material, rolling stock, &amp;c., wdiich will enable them to push on the construction of the line to Baghdad without having to -wait for the piercing of the Taurus. Also, although by the Baghdad Bail way Convention it is agreed that the Baghdad- Basrah section shall not be exploited until the whole of the trunk line is completed, yet this clause does not preclude the building and working of other sections, and there is therefore nothing to prevent the Germans from building and exploiting the whole of the line between Adana and Baghdad. Adana could then be linked, if necessary, with Eregli when sufficient money had been laid aside from loans and profits on construction ( f the Bagbdad-Adana sec tions to overcome the difficulties of the mountain range. 5. But apart from the fact that German ingenuity has suggested a method of evading, if not of solving the problem of the Cilician Gates, it •Enclosure to despatch from Sir N. O’Conor to appears piobdble from Mr. Mark Sykes sir Edward Giey, No. 187, dated the 20 th March Memorandum* of 1st M arch 1906, that 1906 ‘ German influence and German manipul ation of Ottoman finance may enable the Company eventually to surmount alone the financial difficulties which were at one time held likely to bar the completion of the line by them without our assistance. On the whole it seems probable that, if our participation in the scheme is much longer delayed, we shall be unable to rely on the pecuniary embarrassment of the Company as a factor in the situation inducing them to seek our assistance. 6. In the second place, we are disposed to doubt whether our position with reference to the question of a terminus for the railway is as strong as we were previously inclined to believe. It appears to have been the original intention of the concessionaires that the line should terminate at a port on or near the open sea, and some spot in the neighbourhood of Koweit appeared to be indicated at first as a likely terminus. The financiers controlling the syndi cate seem, however, to have cast about for the means of making themselves independent of British assistance in the matter, and from the report of Captain Mahon who was specially deputed last year to make an examination of all possible termini, there would appear to be no reason why they should not succeed in attaining their object. _ Captain Mahon is of opinion that there are no engineering difficulties which would prevent Basrah from being made the terminus of the line, and he thinks that it would provide a port capableof accommodating steamers fully equal to the demands of trade for many years to come. He further points out that from a commercial point of view Basrah offers advantages over all possible termini. His opinion as to the feasibility of dredging the bar of the Shatt-el-Arab is supported by His Excel lency the Naval Commander-in-Chief and by the officers of the British India Steam Navigation Company who ply in those waters. Mr. Grant Duff’s recent * Telegram to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for rCpOl’t ' of Gdinan attempts to pilT- Foreign Affairs, dated the 9 th May 1906. chase from Persia a concession for a port and a coaling station at the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab is not without significance. We are still disposed to think that the best terminus is to be found in the neighbourhood of the Khor Abdulla or of Kathama Bay. But we recognise that a suitable port may, if necessary, be secured at some point less directly subject to British influence. 7. In these circumstances, though our opinion on the subject has not been invited by His Majesty’s Government, we think it desirable that we should place you in possession of our views as to the advantages to be secured by participation in the scheme and as to the dangers to be feared, in the event of the project being completed without reference to British claims. The authoritative statements in regard to the detrimental effects likely to be produced upon British interests by a railway on the alignment proposed, if under the exclusive control of a great military and industrial nation, have been summarised in Part Y of Mr. Alwyn Parker’s ^Memorandum, dated the 10th of March 1906. His Majesty’s Government have no doubt considered these statements and the conclusions arrived at in them, but even at the risk of recapitulating arguments, with which His Majesty’s Government are already familiar, we think it as well on the present occasion to lay stress on some considerations of both local and general importance, with which the Govern ment of India regard themselves as intimately concerned. 8. At Baghdad we have had a Resident since 1766. Kerbala and Nejef are annually visited by large numbers of Indian pilgrims. At Basrah there is a British Consul, who is charged with the care of British trade which is represented by 81*05 per cent of the shipping coming into the port,^ and by the Tigris and Euphrates Steam Navigation Company who are the principal carriers of merchandise between Basrah and Baghdad, and who are subsidised by the Indian Government. At Koweit for some years past we have been steadily endeavouring to consolidate our influence in anticipation of the day when the port of a trans-continental railway system should be located in this neighbour hood. Lately we have, with the approval of His Majesty’s Government, sent a British Political Agent to reside at this port and have authorised the Sheikh to adopt a distinctive flag. The Baghdad-Khanikin route is the line by which a very substantial share of British trade with Persia passes. 9. The Germans have already clearly shown that they have no intention of confining their energies to the mere construction of a through line of rail. The Convention itself gives them the right to construct a branchf from Sadijeh to Khanikin, to establish^ various industries, to construct^ quays at the terminal port, to utilise || such natural water power as may be avail able, and during construction to run^[ steamers on the Tigris. Schemes have also been started by German com mercial associations for the exploitation of the mineral wealth of the country traversed by the railway. Nor do they intend to restrict their activity to Meso potamia only. In 1897, they appointed, for the first time, a Consul to reside at Bushire, where their commercial interests are still of the most slender *• Sir n. O’Conor to sir Edward Grey, No. 246, description ; while in Mesopotamia they dated the utir April 1906. recently posted** a Vice-Consul at Mosut ostensibly for the purpose of looking after the affairs of the German Scientific Mission to Kela Shergat and Babylon. His Majesty’s Consul-General at Baghdad has expressed the opinion that the real object of the so-cale Scientific Mission is the collection of information and the dissemination or German influence in connection with the construction ol the Baghdad Railway. f Article I. £ Article XXII. § Article XXIII, l| Article XXV. Article IX.4 1 , i | J ■ A scheme has even been mentioned for starting at Bahrein a banking business under the auspices of the Deutsche Bank and the German Consul at Bushire has more than once made special inquiries as to the status of German subjects trading at this port and their claims to German Consular representation. ^ 10. Further, we recently learnt from Mr. Spring-Bice’s letter No. 215 ^ ) (Confidential), to Sir E. Grey, dated 28th March 1906, that there was reason to suppose that the mission of the newly-appointed German Minister to Persia was not unconnected wuth a project for linking up the Baghdad Railway with Persia by means of a road via Khanikin. Mr. Spring-Rice pointed out that, in the event of this concession being granted, and in the event of the revival of a concession which the Germans formerly possessed for the construction of a road from Khanikin to Kermanshah, the Germans would control the pilgrim route to Kerbala -which is the only line in Persia w hich is certain to 'pav. We have also learnt that the German Diplomatic representatives have been taking an unusual inten st in the progress of the boundary dispute between Turkey and Persia, and it is obvious that the acquisition by Turkey of a considerable slice of the mountainous country which bounds Mesopotamia on the east would tend greatly to strengthen the position of the power holding the plains of the Euphrates and Tigris. Again, the grant of a road concesssion from Baghdad to Kermanshah would imperil the chances of a com bination of England, France, and Russia for participation in the scheme, as it would be very difficult then to reconcile the conflicting interests by a scheme which would do justice to the claims of all parties concerned. The conflict between German and British interests in and around the Gulf was, however, fully discussed in the despatch from the Government of India, No. 27 / ui (Frontier), dated the 4th February 1901, and it has again been referred to in our Secret-External despatch No. 97, dated the 12th July ]906. The arrival of a German railway at Basrah, Um Kasr, Koweit, or any other point in this quarter must tend to the Germanisation of the Baghdad ‘ and Basrah M ilayets, the diminution of British prestige and commerce in these provinces, and the disturbance of our relations with the Arab Chiefs on the southern and western shores of the Gulf; it would react on our position in Persia, and would possibly, if indeed not probably, necessitate a considerable increase to the British naval forces which at present are stationed in these waters. 11. Apart from the disturbance of our commercial and political position, it is difficult to believe that a trans-continental railway terminatin'’- on the Gulf would not sooner or later bring with it the construction of fortifications such as those which guarded the maritime termini of the trans-Siberian Rail way. The manner m which any such result would be viewed bv His Majestv’s Government has been clearly indicated by various formal utterances. In Au^us* 1902, at an interview with the Shah, Lord Lansdowne informed His Majesty that “our special concern was of course with the southern part of Persia and with the Persian Gulf, and we should, if occasion arose, put forth the whole of our strength m order to prevent encroachments bv other Powers in these regions ; and again on the 5th May 1903 His Lordship declared in the Gouse of Lords:-“ In the third place-I say it without hesitation—we should regard the establishment of a naval base or of a fortified port in the fnTwp R hmL bj an,V °i tber w Wer as i a Tery grave menace to British interests, and we should certainly resist it with ail the means at our disposal ”. 12. But, scanning a wider horizon, it appears to us certain that German relym ^T the fIT-founderbelief that the line will prove to be a Spec ' u ^ I10n ’ mtend t0 use it as a means for the prosecu- o tionoS their ambitions in the near and middle east. Sir N. O’Conor reported the^nitoHan hH' ^ :7th A P ril 1906, that the President of a nromit from t) * n Ra / lway Com P anies had succeeded in obtaining in P thr^aioTf Kn . buRan , of . a concession for a scheme of irrigation 16 000 acres in th ^ rai ^ing the marshy area extending to some mam have had t nei ' h f bourhood Karaviia, a project which ^the Ger- expected to make 11^ ^ ^ ° ther simiiar themes mav be Tfof -ront^ that t ' a P pearanc V» due course. Further, we mav ‘tale fu/nre ff h J- 16 full y ^Hse that the great risk to the future of ,he line lies in the misgovemment and disorder of the districts £ f Itthrough which it passes, and they are doubtless prepared to take the measures which will be required in order to ensure the maintenance of law and order in those districts. We anticipate that when once definite construction has commenced, a more or less gradual process of interference by Germany will ensue in the administration of those portions of the Turkish Empire through which the railway will pass. In time this process can have but one result, namely, the consolidation of German influence throughout this vast and important territory and the eventual passing into German hands of all real power in this particular zone. Eor the maintenance of order local forces, doubtless officered and controlled by Germany at the expense of Turkey, would have to be kept up, and in this connection, the political importance of the existing Haidar Pasha-Eregli line merits serious attention. By means of this line the greater part of Anatolia is brought within the German sphere of influence and the Osmanli inhabitants of this region, who are capable of being converted into fighting material of unrivalled value, would doubtless form the basis of the forces which would be recruited for the purpose of maintaining order. The rapid extension of the Hedjaz railway and its linking up with the Baghdad line would enable the Turkish troops to be concentrated either on the western or eastern frontiers of the Sultan’s dominions, and our position in Egypt and at Aden and even the Bed Sea route to India would be threatened, while it would be more difficult for the Arabs to make head against the power of the Porte. 13. The Government of India cannot regard with equanimity the possible creation of a situation such as that sketched above. With the concentration of so much power in German hands, and with the shadow of an eventual Busso-German alliance looming in the distance, there would be ground for serious apprehension and a large increase to the military expenditure of the United Kingdom would be inevitable. 14. These considerations have led us to the opinion that in the interests of India it is necessary that we should no longer confine ourselves to an attitude of passive expectation in the hope that the progress of the line may be stopped by natural, political, or financial obstacles ; that it is hopeless to attempt to block the scheme by any action within our power; and that it is therefore obligatory to secure such an interest in the undertaking as may minimize the risks of its falling under the control of a single power or being utilised as a means of overthrowing our present predominant position in the Gulf and of menacing India. 15. His Majesty’s Government have no doubt already considered m what manner a si,are in this great enterprise may be secured, if this is still prac ticable. In time of peace, the control of the south-eastern portion of the line would materially add to our prestige in the Gulf. In the event of future war, however, it would certainly not provide us with a guarantee of protection while, on the other hand, there wmuld be nothing to prevent our particular section from beinn' used by our enemies at their will. In our opinion our interests can be most effectively safeguarded by some arrangement that will enable the British Gov ernment to take part in the scheme as a whole. By the adoption of such a course we should, among other things, pave the way for the employment of British officers for the maintenance of order, and the pre-eminent faculty which Englishmen possess for the management of Asiatics might be expected soon to secure for us the predominant share of these duties in the regions traversed bv the line. It has been proved again and again that Englishmen can w ork in climates where Germans can barely exist, and we have the great advantage of being able to draw on India for cheap military material. 16. We would, therefore, in the event of no decision having as yet been arrived at on the subject of British participation in the Bail way, venture strongly to recommend that every effort should be made to obtain the largest possible share in the whole project from Eregli onwards. As an alternative, but only in the event of this proving impracticable, we would advocate thatNo. 97 or 1906. GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. FOREIGN DEPARTMENT. SECRET. External. To Thb Right Hon'ble JOHN MORLEY, O.M., Sit Majesty'i Secretary of State for India, Simla, the 12th July 1906, Sir, In His Excellency the Viceroy’s telegram of 26th May, we expressed our willingness to contribute on certain conditions a sum of £50,000 towards a loan which it might be advisable, in the opinion of His Majesty’s Government, to make, on the decease of His Majesty the Shah of Persia, to His Imperial Highness the Wali Ahd, with a view to preventing anarchy in Persia. It will perhaps be convenient if we supplement the telegraphic summary of our views by a somewhat tuller exposition of our general attitude towards the question of granting loans to Persia from Indian revenues. 2. We are fully alive to the danger of the spread of anarchy in Persia, which might enable interested foreign Powers to take measures menacing to the security at present enjoyed by India on her flank, and consequently entail a drain on our resources far in excess of the sums which we have already lent to the Persian Government. Nor do we deny that it is a matter of great importance to prevent Persia falling completely into the financial toils of a potential enemy such as Russia or Germany. We appreciate the gravity of these general.considerations. But we think that any further advances to Persia from Indian revenues should be made conditional upon tangible and definite concessions, such as will tend to secure us against the dangers just indicated, and to strengthen our position in the south of Persia and the Gulf. 3. We may perhaps illustrate our meaning by a brief review of the recent history of loans to Persia. For some years before 1898 the finances of that country had been disorganised and constant deficits had compelled recourse to temporary advances from various sources. It was soon evident, however, that it was vain to seek finanoial aid save from Russia or Great Britain. In 1898 proposals were made for a loan of a million and a quarter sterling to be floated in London by the Imperial Bank. But the terms, which included a provision for direct control of the Customs, were considered by the Grand Vizier to be unduly onerous; the amount was declared to be insufficient; and the negotia tions collapsed. The endeavour to arrange a British loan having failed, His^ Majesty s Government approached the Czar’s Ministers, with suggestions for joint action in providing the Persian Government with funds. The Russian Government professed to regard the idea with favour, and desultory discussions continued tiU late in 1899. In September of that year, Count LamsdorS declared that no negotiations fora Russian loan had taken place, and that, should any he undertaken, they would be preceded by a frank exchange of views with His Majesty’s Government. The value of the assurance was soon to be shown.2 On the 30th January 1900, the Bussian official gazette announced the conclusion of a Persian loan of 22,500,000 roubles at 5 per cent, the bonds to issue at 85. The amount was secured on the entire Customs of Persia, save only those of “Pars and the Persian Gulf”. In case of default, provision was made for direct control. Persia was debarred from obtaining any fresh foreign loan until 1910, save with the previous consent of the Russian Government. A portion of the loan was to be utilised to pay off the entirety of the British debt of 1892 and of the various sums advanced by the Imperial Bank. Among the more tangible political considerations for the loan may be mentioned an understanding as to the construction of a line of telegraph from Meshed to the south of Khorasan. 1. The relief was only temporary. In the following year the Shah was again in need of funds, and the British Government were again approached. His Majesty’s Government were anxious to avert a further Bussian loan. The money could not, however, bo raised in the London market, nor could the Home Treasury provide the amount. Enquiry was therefore made whether Indian revenues could find a sum of £500,000. Lord Curzon’s Government at once replied that the Government of India not only could advance the capital, but considered the opportunity one of the greatest political importance. An adequate return must be obtained, however, and the terms suggested were as follows :— * (1) the loan to be secured upon the Customs of the Gulf Ports and upon the revenues or Customs, preferably the former, of Seistan; (2) the contemplated changes in the Persian tariff then under discus sion with Bussia to be submitted to, and receive the assent of, the Government of India; (3) the loan to be accompanied by a plain statement to the Persian Government that, in view of the British interests thus created, in addition to those already existing in Southern Persia and Seistan, His Majesty’s Government could not admit the creation of any rival interest in those regions. To avoid infringement of the recent Bussian contract which forbade the raising of a foreign loan, it was proposed that the transaction should be concluded through the intermediary of the Imperial Bank. Eurther discussions followed. Finally, on the 6th November, His Majesty’s Minister was authorised to offer a loan of the amount named, subject to conditions based upon His Excellency’s recommendations. But modifications were introduced which diminished the direct political advantage; and Sir Arthur Hardinge was informed that the advance could not be made through the Imperial Bank. The Atabeg at once replied that some assurance would be required that his acceptance of the loan would not violate the contract with Bussia, which forbade the raising of any external loan. The restriction as to payment through the Bank was subsequently withdrawn; but the negotiations fell through. 5. A further Bussian loan was already being discussed. In September 1901 and in January and March 1902 sums aggregating 3,000,000 roubles were advanced by the Banque d’Escompte; and in April 1902, the announcement appeared of a further Bussian loan of 10,000,000 roubles. The terms were similar to those of the transaction of 1900, save that the period of financial tutelage was extended from 1910 to 1912, and that the security for the loan mcluded, not only^ the existing Customs revenues of Persia, but also those which might be derived from Customs posts established thereafter. The latter provision was clearly intended to include new posts on the land frontier e ween British and Persian Baluchistan. But substantial political advantages ad also been gained. The Bussian Government had secured the right of negotiating a new tariff most advantageous to Bussian trade while penalising British imports, without the intervention of any third Power. A concession lad been obtained for the construction of a road through Azerbaijan to lehran. Imally, the term of the Busso-Persian Bailway Agreement of 1890 had been extended for a further period of ten years. The original document ad provided that for a term of ten years the Persian Government w r ould notItself construct, “ nor permit nor grant a concession for the construction of railways to a company or other persons The renewal Agreement signed on the 14th December 1899 included the significant proyision “ that for another ten years, excepting the Russian Government, no other Government will be given a concession to build railways in Persia Other concessions, however, for which M. Witte had made strenuous efforts, had not been granted; the offer of a British loan had at least assisted the Persian Government in placing some check upon the rapacity of Russian demands. 6. The need for money was now chronic; within a few months a further loan was needed; the British Minister was again approached; and India was again invited to assist. The experience of the previous year had shown the difficulties which beset a simple loan. His Majesty’s Government suggested, therefore, that the transaction should take the form of a purchase from the Persian Government of the sole right to construct roads, railways, and other commercial undertakings in Seistan and South-East Persia and in the region between Mohammerah and Kermanshah. Eor the present, however, the Russo- Persian Railway Agreement barred the way ; and until such time, therefore, as we could exercise the right of constructing railways, it was proposed to provide that Persia should pay interest on the purchase money secured on the Customs of Southern Persia. Eor so substantial a return, the Government of India were prepared to lend any sum up to a million pounds sterling. It was suggested, however, that the area of the monopoly to be of any value must extend across the entire width of Southern Persia, and not be confined to the extreme east and west. The Minister was instructed to endeavour to secure the grant of privileges of the kind indicated in return for a loan of half a million sterling. But Sir Arthur Hardinge was opposed to the demand of considerable conces sions, and eventually was authorised to make an advance without direct return of any kind. On the 4th April 1903, a sum of £200,000 was placed at the disposal of the Persian Government. The interest was to be 5 per cent; the security consisted of the Caspian Sea Fishery dues, the Post and Telegraph reve nues, and the Customs of Pars and the Persian Gulf. The loan w r as repayable in twenty years. But the annual instalments were not fixed, nor w^as it definitely agreed that the sum should not be repaid in a shorter period. The transaction was effected through the Imperial Bank. Something had been gained. It had been shown that Persia wns not yet in complete financial bondage to the Russian Government; and to enhance the value of the proof, the Grand Vizier refused to consider a proposal which the Russian Minister hastened to make of a further Russian loan to discharge the British debt. Hardly had this sum been advanced, when the Grand Vizier expressed his desire for further assistance ; and alter lengthy discussions, an additional sum of £100,000 was paid to the Persian Government on the 1st September 1904. It was definitely stipulated that this advance should form a part of that made in the previous year, and that the whole should be repaid, capital and interest, in twenty equal annual instalments. The total sum of £300,000 was advanced by the Government of India, but the British Government accepted a liability for one-half of any eventual loss. 7. Prom this retrospect it will be seen that the Russian Government have consistently used their loans to secure definite political and commercial objects which have given them a very strong hold upon the Government of the Shah. The Government of India have also striven to obtain some such consideration for their advances, but hitherto the results have been rather negative, though the advances themselves have perhaps been of use in that they have prevented the Shah from falling hopelessly under the financial domi nation of Russia and have also limited to some extent the demands which the Russian Government might have made upon Persia for further concessions. 8. The same policy was followed again when in ]904 and 1905 negotia tions were taking place with the Persian Government for. the completion, also on the basis of a joint British guarantee, of the loan of £500,000, of which the loan of £200,000 effected in 1903 was to have been the first instalment, the Government of India laid stress on such a loan being conditional on the grant\ of a concession of much political value in Arabistan, namely, the gift of nreferential rights to Great Britain in connection with the carrying out of irrigation projects on the Karun Kiver. On 16th May 1905, your predecessor was informed that the Government of India were opposed to any further advance beino* made from Indian revenues without political conditions: and later in the same year the assent of the Government of India to a further loan of £150,000 out of Indian funds, subject to the usual joint British guarantee, was conditional on the specific inclusion in the revenues pledged to us of the Arabistan Customs and the promise that all railway construction in Southern Persia, including Seistan, should, as far as foreign assistance was concerned, be carried out under the auspices of His Majesty’s Government. When this proposal collapsed owing, apparently, to the desire of the Persian Govern- ment for a larger loan (though it is not quite clear from the correspondence communicated to us whether this was the only reason) and our 'views were invited in December 1905 on a fresh proposal of the Persian Government for a British loan of £800,000, we expressed our inability to produce this sum out of Indian funds, even with a joint British guarantee, unless further sub stantial political and commercial concessions were granted in exchange; and on 9th January last, we gave a list of concessions which we considered should be obtained and which, we still hold, even now that the negotiations have been broken off by His Majesty’s Government, would be of intrinsic value, both commercially and strategically and as a means of preventing the spread of anti-British influences in Southern Persia. 9. To turn to another aspect of the question, namely, the relative respon sibility of the Home and Indian Exchequers for the maintenance of British interests in Persia, we recognise that, for the purpose of avoiding undue publicity, the practice of obtaining funds for these loans out of Indian^revenues is convenient: it is an expedient, however, which should, in our opinion, only be resorted to in cases of urgent necessity : and we respectfully submit that, should a loan to Persia be considered desirable in the future for the protection of imperial interests without definite consideration or out of regard to the political situation in Europe, it will he rather for His Majesty’s Govern ment to advance the money than for the Government of India, who only have the comparatively small financial resources of India on which to draw. In formulating our views we have assumed that His Majesty’s Government are prepared to hold themselves responsible for half the amount of any advances of either kind that may be made, but even so we feel bound to indicate our extreme reluctance to invest more Indian capital in trying to prop up a bankrupt Government without definite and tangible consideration. The value of such consideration would, of course, depend upon the readiness of His Majesty’s Government to utilise and enforce, in case of necessity, the con cessions which constitute it, 10. We do not propose in this despatch to discuss the question of British general policy in Persia. If circumstances have rendered it desirable to alter that policy or to formulate a detailed plan of action in the event of certain contingencies, we trust that we may be informed at an early date, as it is obvious that our willingness to lend in any circumstances to the Persian Government must depend upon the attitude of His Majesty’s Government towards that country, in which the interests and even the safety of India are so closely involved. 11. In offering these remarks we have no desire to hamper His Majesty’s Government in any negotiations which may be pending or in progress with a view to the conclusion of an understanding with Russia on the subjects on which there has hitherto been a conflict of interest. Although in the Viceroy’s telegram of the 13th February 1906 we expressed some doubt as to the confidence which should be reposed in Russian assurances in relation to Persia, we fully recognise that His Majesty’s Government are alone in a posi tion to estimate how far these doubts are justified in the present position of European politics, and we should welcome any definite agreement with Russia which recognise^ and effectively protected our special interests in Persia. We think it our duty, however, once more to call attention to the possibility that concerted action with Russia may, unless adequate safeguards are obtained.be attended with results inimical to the maintenance of our predominant influence in those parts of Persia with which India is primarily concerned and which it is essential, in our opinion, that we should maintain.

M. Bompard found that M. Kokovtsoff was not to be easily persuaded, as he maintained that any line which facilitated communications with Persia would seriously compete with Russian trade in that country. M. Bompard pointed out that the German Syndicate wmuld doubtless eventually complete the line even without foreign assistance, and that it would be advisable to participate under certain conditions before it was too late. M. Bompard instanced to His Excellency the attitude of Great Britain towards the Suez Canal construction, and her having subsequently found it necessary to acquire a share in that undertaking. These arguments did not shake M. Kokovtsoff’s objections; and then M. Bompard mentioned to His Excellency an alternative, that perhaps Russia might feel disposed to construct a line herself from julfa to the Gulf. M. Kokovtsoff observed that such a line would be, perhaps, more injurious to Russia’s commercial interests than any other, as it would enable British ^oods from the Gulf to oust Russian trade from Northern Persia. I do not quite understand what prompted M. Bompard to suggest the above alternative to the Minister of Einance. I have never discussed such a project with him, or intimated that it could form a subject for negotiation; but as it was discarded at once by M. Kokovtsoff, I did not feel it necessary to make any observations. M. Bompard added that the Minister of Einance had also mentioned the difficulties which the Russian Government would experience in finding the necessary funds, and Via W1 onrWmired to make it clear to M.

Macedonia and the Bagdad Railway June 15.] Section 3. To the Editor of the “ Times.” House of Commons, June 14, 1906. I HOPE I may be mistaken as to a single point in connection with the reply given by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs yesterday to a question which I put to him on this subject, and I have placed a further question on the paper, which will, I trust, clear it up. But the matter which I brought to his notice is so urgent that I feel it my duty to trespass upon your space in the endeavour to obtain at least a second hearing of an issue which would seem to be of far-reaching national importance. . , . It is proposed that this country should consent to an increase ot 3 per cent, m tlie customs duties, fixed by Treaty at 8 per cent., which are levied on imports into Turkey. It has been estimated that at least 60 per cent, of the Turkish customs are levied on British trade. It has also been calculated by the Foreign Office that the suggested increase of 3 per cent, would bring in an additional revenue to Tur ey o about 750,0001 a-year. Of this sum, 25 per cent, must, under the Decree of 1903, be applied to the reduction of debt; but the remaining 75 per cent., or 560,00 0 L a-year, would flow direct into the Turkish Treasury. The proposal is that this 560,000 . a-year shall be ear-marked to supply the deficit in the Budget of Macedonia, which deficit amounted in 1904 to about 720,000Z. Economies have, however, been effected since 1904, so that the Macedonian deficit ought now^ to stand at about the same figure as the proposed additional revenue from the customs of Tui vey mz., , The one will about balance the other. i ^ i a Let us proceed a little further. The Macedonian deficit has hitherto been made un by Turkey out of her Imperial funds. It seems to follow', therefore, that these funds, to the extent of about 600,000/. a-year, would be set free for any purpose to which Turkey may desire to apply them in the event of the proposal being sanctioned for an increase in the customs duties. It is credibly reported from Constantinople that these funds thus to be set free are to be applied to finding the guarantee foi the Bagdad Railway. At the same time, by a significant coincidence, the question of the Bagdad Railway is being actively discussed in the German press. A ow your readers are aware that the present condition of that enterprise is briefly this . A certain portion of the railway has already been built m Asia Minor as a nranch of the existing Anatolian Railway, and still at a great distance from the regions which it is ultimately intended to exploit. The task now^ before^ the Germans is the oomnaratively difficult one of taking the line across the Taurus into the Mesopotamian plain. The money for building the existing line was derived from the proceeds of a loan issued by the Turkish Government at 4 per cent, interest and taken up at about 86 I think I am right as to these particulars. If, therefore, the Turks employ the { i eLp mnnev to be set free by the increased customs to the Bagdad Railway, I t «rru2bly be aWe to borrow to the extent of about 12,000,000/. Now, it haTbeen estimated that the section of the railway already completed has cost about 8 000/ a-mile including rolling-stock. If we even allow double this sum—namely, 16 0 000 / a-mile-for the 375 miles which it is now proposed to commence and which, i x f i w pi Lnye taken the enterprise across the Taurus and a long w r ay on ^X“f £rn:; towJdsle Persian Llf, we get a sum of 6,000,000/ which is only half the sum mentioned above as the capitalized value of the revenues set fiec n the*new customs duties if applied to finance the Bagdad Railway. , The nature of this vast enterprise, destined to place under German control, not only a great railway from the Bosphorus to the Persian Gulf, but also the railway [2038 p —3]system of Syria, which is being extended along the Egyptian frontier to Mecca and Medina, is not yet fully appreciated by the general public. I suppose nobody would deny that it is of the utmost importance that this country should have a voice in the future development of this enterprise. Hitherto we have held several very strong cards in our hands. One of the strongest is the necessity for obtaining our consent to any increase in the customs duties. Are we going to give away this card in favour of our friends the Germans ? What are we going to get in return ? A few paltry promises of amelioration in the service of the Customs, and a Mining Eaw r to enable cosmopolitan speculators to exploit the mines in Turkey ! Chambers of Commerce in this country would laugh at such concessions, and more than one has already protested against the proposed increase. So much as regards our trade. As for Macedonia, which has been made the pretext for the increase, I fail to see that there is the smallest justification for consenting to the employment of these customs funds to defray the military and civil expenditure of Turkey in that province. If they be so employed at all, it ought surely to be necessary to obtain the strictest safeguards. The reform scheme introduced by the Powers into Macedonia has been aptly described by your evidently well-informed correspondent “Viator” as not supplying any machinery, even in theory, adequate to cope with the elemental evils of civil war, murder, rape, and brigandage. Is it seriously proposed that we should impair, if not destroy, the strong position we at present hold in relation to the Bagdad Railway, and that we should forego those solid advantages to our trade which we might at any time secure for our consent to an increase in the customs duties in exchange for reforms in Macedonia, which, even on paper, are illusory ? I venture, Sir, to put in a strong plea for a reconsideration of the whole matter. If real reforms be introduced into Macedonia, the deficit will soon he converted into a surplus. Meanwhile, I do trust that we may be saved from committing what I can only characterize in the language of M. de Talleyrand, “ C’est plus qu’un crime : c’est une faute.” Yours respectfully, (Signed) H.

General Railway Development in Asia Minor up to 1903.* The Anatolian Railway Company. (Scutari to Konia, 1,032 kilom., or 645 miles, including Angora line.) The first section of this line, from Scutari to Ismidt (91 kilom.), was originally built to the order of the Turkish Government, under the direction of a German engineer, A on Plessel. It was completed in 1873. The Ottoman autho rities soon found it difficult to work, and in 1SS0 granted it as a Concession to an English Com pany for twenty years. They had, however, reserved the right to determine the Concession at anv date, and they exercised it in October 1SS8 in favour of M. Kaulla, a German. At the same time this gentleman received a Concession for ninety-nine years for a line from Ismidt to Angora, a distance of 487 kilom., with a kilometric guarantee of 15,000 fr., while the guarantee for the section from Scutari to Ismidt o was fixed at 10,300 fr. per kilometre. M. Kaulla was acting on behalf of the Deutsche Bank and the Wurtembergiscke Vereinsbank. On the 16th March, 1889, these two institutions founded the Ottoman Company of Anatolian Railways. Practically the whole capital of the new Company was subscribed in Germany. The line to Angora began to work in 1893. In Februarv of the same vear two further1 3 Kaiserieh would not prove remunerative, and it was consequently abandoned. The section to Konia was opened to traffic in 1896. The total mileage of the Anatolian Company at this time was 615, made up as follows :— Scutari to Ismidt Miles. 57 Ismidt to Angora 304 Eskichehir to Konia # * 279 Branch Line .. •• 5 Total 645 The Managing Director of the railway was at first M. von Kuhlman, who was afterwards succeeded by M. Zander. The Chief Engineer was M. von Kapp. Before enumerating the further stages of the Turco-German negotiations in regard to railway development, it will be convenient to describe briefly other lines in Asiatic Turkey which are only partially under German influence, or entirely independent. The Smyrna-Cassaba Railway Company. (Total length, with extension to Afioun-lvara- hissar and branches, 518 kilom., or 321 miles.) The Smyrna-Cassaba Bailway Concession was granted in 1863 to Mr. E. Price, who transferred his rights to a British Company. In 1872 an extension of 75 kilom., from Cassaba to Ala- chehir, was sanctioned. In 1893 the Ottoman Government exercised the right of repurchase, and transferred the line to M. Georges Nagelmackers (Director of the International Sleeping Car Company), granting him at the same time an extension to Afioun- Karahissar. In the following year, M. Nagelmackers transferred the line to the Societe Nouvelle des Chemins de Per Smyrne-Cassaba et Prolonge- ment, with its head-quarters at Paris. The Company was thus placed more or less under Erench influence. Afioun-Karahissar was, however, already served by the Anatolian Bail way, and it was obvious that if a junction were effected much of thetraffic destined for shipment to Europe would he diverted from Constantinople (483 kilom.) to the more convenient port of Smyrna (420 kilom.). The German Company fully realized the danger, and the two lines remained separated by a few yards. Negotiations were at length begun between the two Companies, and resulted in an arrangement by which two Erench representatives were admitted to the Board of the Anatolian Bail- wav and two Germans to that of the Smyrna- Cassaha Company. The Deutsche Bank had meanwhile purchased shares in the latter Com pany, and now possesses a majority of the total issue, and consequently a casting vote. When this arrangement was concluded (in 1899) the Porte at once removed its veto on the junction of the two lines at Afioun-Karahissar, and it was effected in 1901. # Dr. Bohrbach, in his’hook “ Die Bagdadbahn,” published in Berlin in 1902, expresses the view that the line to Smyrna should in reality be looked upon as the first section of the Bagdad Bail way. The Smyrna-Aidin Railway Company. (Total length 516 kilom., or 322 miles, including 2 miles leased and worked.) The oldest Bailway Concession in Asia-Minor is that which was granted to the Smyrna-Aidin Company in September 1856. The railway now consists of a main line from Smyrna to Dineir, via Aidin, 376 kilom. (235 miles) in length, and of seven branch lines, 140 kilom. (87 miles) in length. In 1891 the Company applied for a Concession to prolong the line from Dineir to Konia. They were unsuccessful on this, as on a subsequent occasion (in 1901). The refusal of the Porte was, in the circum stances, most natural. The Aidin line possessed no kilometric guarantee. On the other hand, the Cassaba extension, from Alachehir to Afioun- Karahissar, had a guarantee of 18,900 fr. per kilometre. It was in the interest of the Turkish Government to diminish this guarantee by in creasing the traffic as rapidly as possible. * But apparently now the two lines are no longer joined (March 1906)Sir N. O’Conor, No. 276, April 24, 1906. 5 The Mersina-Tarsus and Adana Railway Company {Limited). (Total length 67 kilom., or 42 miles.) This Company is under the management of an Anglo-French Board, which sits at Constan tinople. The President is Mr. E. Pears. The Concession includes mining, quarrying, and forestry rights, as well as immunity from taxation, and is for fifty years from January 1888. The railway then reverts, subject to pay ment for rolling-stock, &amp;c., to the Ottoman Government, who may, however, by arrangement with the Company, determine the duration of the Concession at any date after 1912.- Much official correspondence, terminating with Mr. de Bunsen’s despatch No. 146, Commercial, of the 9th October, took place during 1900 on the subject of the fears entertained by the Mersina- Adana Company that the extension of the Bagdad Bail way into their country, with access to a port :;; ' on the Gulf of Alexandretta, would seriously injure their interests. In December 1905 Baron de Yendeuvre, the Vice-Chairman of the Company, left Constanti nople for Berlin, where, after several interviews with Dr. Zander and Herr Gwinner, acting on behalf of the Anatolian Bailway Company and Deutsche Bank respectively, he came to an arrangement by which he undertook to place those Companies jointly in possession of a sufficient number of ordinary and preference shares of the Mersina Bailway to command a majority of votes at general meetings of the Company. The German group now control about 1,440 to 1,450 votes out of a total of 2,807. Mr. Pears and Sir W. Whittall remain on the Board. * Mersina is not a convenient terminus for a great railway; it possesses no harbour, and the roadstead is much exposed. [581] C6 Part II. The Bagdad Bailway Convention oe March 1903. The earlier phases of the negotiations between the Porte and the Anatolian Company are now of little more than historical interest, as the original Agreements underwent repeated and far-reaching modification, and were eventually superseded by two documents, the Bagdad Railway Convention and the Statutes of the Societe Imperiale du Chemin de Per de Bagdad, both dated the 5th March, 1903. (See Appendix.) The original plan had been to carry on the trans-continental line, not from Konia, but from Angora, the northern extension of the Anatolian Railway system, through Sivas and Diarbekir to the Tigris. The Ottoman Government had from the first strongly favoured this plan, as it pre sented great strategical advantages. This view was throughly appreciated by the Russian Gov ernment, who, as a measure of self-defence, concluded a Convention with the Porte, generally known as the “ Black Sea Basin Agreement,” in March 1.900, which practically rendered im possible all railway construction in northern Asia Minor, unless under Russian auspices. The Anatolian Company, partly no doubt on political, hut mainly on commercial grounds, decided to reject the northern route in favour of the southern one. The text of the Convention will be found in the Appendix. The following are the main features of the Final Concession, as summarized in Mr. Chirol’s “ Middle Eastern Question ” :— “ From Konia the first section of the railway, which was opened to traffic in October 1904, presented no serious difficulties. It continues to run so far over the Anatolian Plateau at an altitude of about 3,000 feet. After reaching Eregli, however, it is immediately con fronted by the Taurus Mountains. Advantage is to be taken of the Chakit Su canon, and then the railway will cross the small and fertile plain of Adana before scaling the second, but less formidable rampart, which falls away in easier slopes towards the basin of the Euphrates and Tigris. “ The two sections from Eregli to Adana, and from Adana to Tell-Habesh, where the branch line willdiverge to Aleppo and Northern Syria, will certainly prove the most costly and difficult portion of the entire line, as they will necessitate altogether nearly 100 miles of blasting and tunnelling. After emerging from the Taurus Mountains the line, instead of sweeping round the foothills through the fairly populous and fertile districts of Urfa and Diarbekir into the upper valley of the Tigris and down to Mosul, is to be carried in a straight line across the desert, between the twin rivers of Mesopotamia to Mosul, and thence down the desolate right bank of the Tigris to Bagdad. It is true that a feeder is to be thrown out at Urfa, and others are contemplated later on to Marash, Aintab, Birejik, Mardin, Erbil, and to Tuzkurmatli and Salahieh in the Kerkuk district. But the proposed route for the main line would hardly have been adopted by the Company, had not the kilometric guarantee rendered it financially independent of the immediate resources of the country to be traversed between the Taurus and Bagdad. “From Bagdad a very important branch is to go off to the Persian frontier at Khanikin, whence one of the chief trade routes into Persia lies through Kermanshah and Hamadan to Tehran. The annual value of the British trade carried on with Persia by this route (1902) is estimated at 750,0001.—a fact which serves inci dentally to illustrate the many-sided bearings of the Bagdad Railway upon British interests. From Bagdad the main line is to trend back to the Euphrates, and cross it again in order to touch at the two sacred cities of the Shiah Mussulmans, Kerbela and Nedjef, where the mere pilgrim traffic from Persia and from India will prove a considerable source of revenue, on the way down to Bussorah, the chief port of the Shatt- el-Arab, and to its appointed terminus, wherever that may ultimately be, on the Persian Gulf. The barest preliminary surveys have, however, yet been made of the Mesopotamian sections of the railway, which will certainly present some rather serious difficulties, owing to the intricate network of swamps and marshes that cover so large a portion of the great fluvial delta. “ The total length of the new railway, including the branches, for the construction of which immediate provision is made, is not set down anywhere in the Convention, even approximately, though, in view of the kilometric guarantee to which the Turkish Govern ment is pledged, it would seem to be a very material point. It may be estimated, roughly, at 1,750 miles, and if 638 miles be added for the existing Anatolian Railways, and for the Smyrna-Cassaba and Mersina- Adana Railways, which have already passed under German control, another 400 miles, the entire system will amount to an aggregate of nearly 2,800 miles. “ The Concession is granted (Article II) for ninety- nine years, but in reality it will extend over a slightly longer period. For the ninety-nine years’ term will run for each of the sections, into which the line is tobe divided, from the date when the State bonds to be issued by the Ottoman Government are handed over in respect of it. The Anatolian Railways Concession, which was originally for a similar term of ninety-nine years, from 1888, is at the same time extended so as to cover the full period of the new Company s Con cession. “ The new line is to be divided up for purposes of construction into sections, each of approximately 200 Idiom. (Article III). These sections are not specified, but it is understood that, starting from Konia, the main line will comprise twelve sections, viz., Konia-Eregli (opened in 1904), Eregli-Adana, Adana-Tellhabesh (whence the branch line to Aleppo), Tellhabesh-Harran (whence the branch line to Urfa), Harran-Nussibin Nussibin-Mosul, Mosul-Tekrit, lek- rit-Bagdad (with a branch line from Sadijeh to Khanikin, on the Persian frontier), Bagdad-Nedjef, Nedjef-Zubeir, and Bashar (two sections), and finally Zubeir to the Persian Gulf. “ Article IV binds the concessionnaire to begin work on the first section within three months from approval of the plans, and to complete it within two years. [It was actually completed in October 1904.] At the same time it is provided that the whole line and its branches shall be completed within eight years, a curiously short allowance for the completion of the other sections when compared with the two years allowed for completion of the first section alone. But this Article contains another still more curious provision. The term fixed for the completion of the whole line is subject not only to the punctual fulfilment by the Ottoman Government of its financial obligations towards the concessionnaire, but also to delays arising from force majeure; and force majeure includes, as well as war between European Powers, any radical change in the financial situation of Germany, Great Britain, or France. As there is nothing to indicate what shall be deemed to constitute such a radical change, nor who shall determine when such a radical change stall be held to have taken place, this provision appears liable to very elastic construction. “ The railway is to be built (Article VII) in the first instance for a single line, but a second line is to be laid when the gross kilometric receipts shall have reached 30,000 fr. per annum. “ Article VIII provides for the creation of an Ottoman Joint Stock Company under the name of “ Imperial Ottoman Bagdad Railway Company,” which shall take the place of the Anatolian Railway Company in all that concerns the new line from Konia to the Persian Gulf with its branches. The Anatolian Company engages not to transfer its lines to any other than the Imperial Ottoman Bagdad Railway Company, and the latter binds itself not to part with its property in any shape or form. “ Article IX allows the Company during construction9 to acquire and use steam and sailing vessels and other craft on the Shatt-el-Arab, the Tigris, and the Euphrates, for the transport of materials and other requirements. Considering how jealous the Turkish Government is of all navigation rights on those water ways, this clause, even with the restrictions attached to the permission, is of considerable significance, for when the Company has once acquired the plant necessary for navigating those waters, and established the wharves and warehouses it is entitled, under another Article of the Concession, to construct at Bagdad and Bussorah, it is improbable that it will consent to relinquish the advantages of navigation. “ Article XII opens up the way for an almost indefinite extension of the new Company’s control of the railways, not merely of Asia Minor and Meso potamia, but of Syria and Northern Arabia. Whilst professing to safeguard the rights of the Damascus- Hamah Railway Company, a French Company at present, it secures to the Bagdad Railway Company prior rights for the construction ot any branch con necting it with the Mediterranean between Mersina and Tripoli in Syria. The Bagdad Railway Company is thus brought into contact with the Syrian railway system, which is made up at present of several small lines which would therefore seem bound to pass ulti mately under the control of their powerful neighbour, and eventually, with the line which the Sultan is engaged in building from Damascus to Mecca, via Mezarib. “ Article XXIII gives the Company the right to establish ports on the Tigris at Bagdad, on the Shatt- el-Arab at Bussorah, and at the terminal point on the Persian Gulf. With the powers- conferred upon it the Company, as the owner of the wharves, quays, ware houses, &amp;c., which it is authorized to construct, must inevitably acquire complete control of the traffic by water as well as by land. Mention may also be made in this connection of Article XXIX, which forbids the working of any section of the line between Bagdad and Bussorah that may have been built before com pletion of the main line from Konia to Bagdad. The new Company clearly has no wish to see that district opened up from the Persian Gulf before it has obtained access to it from the north. “ The financial obligations of the Ottoman Govern ment are set forth in Article XXXY. It guarantees a twofold kilometric annuity, one of 11,000 fr. per kilom., built and opened to traffic, and one of 4,500 fr. per kilom. towards working expenses, and provides for the mode of payment of those annuities. An Ottoman State Loan at 4 per cent., with a sinking fund of •087538 per cent., to be guaranteed by special appro priations, which shall be settled before the construction of each successive section is commenced, is to represent the kilometric annuity of 11,000 fr., the Company [581] D10 receiving bonds of a face value of 269,110 fr. 65 c. per kilometre, built and opened to traffic. 1 be annuity of —— ~r 4,500 fr. per kilometre towards working expenses, which is to be gradually reduced as the gross kilometric surplus of the guarantees already appropriated to the Anatolian Railway. The Bagdad Railway Company, moreover, pledges to the holders of the State bonds the whole line from Konia to the Persian Gulf and its branches, and all its rolling-stock, &amp;c^ and its share of the net receipts. The bondholders, howeyer, will haye no right to interfere in the administration of the Company. The liabilities of the Ottoman Government under this clause are heavy. It is true that in respect of the Anatolian Railway a kilometric guarantee only verv slightly inferior in amount was given by the Porte, that the revenue of both the Konia and Angora lines has shown remarkable expansion, and that, as a set-off to the proportionately diminishing burden on the Treasury, Turkey has materially benefited by the increased prosperity of the provinces thus opened up to Bagdad Railway beyond Konia may also be expected to earn a fair revenue, the same can certainly not be predicated of the further sections, and especially not of those which cross the arid wastes of the Upper Euphrates and Tigris basin. There, even according to German estimates, many years, and even decades, must elapse before there can be any results to show for the heavy annual payments which the Turkish Exchequer will have to meet. Even in what were of old the most fertile tracts of Mesopotamia, extensive and costly works of both irrigation and drainage will be required in addition to the railway if anything like its ancient prosperity is to be restored. Many different calculations have been made as to the amount which the kilometric guarantee on the whole Bagdad line is likely to reach, and a very moderate estimate places it at over 1,000,000/. per annum, after allowing for probable revenue. How is the Turkish Exchequer, in its condition of chronic penury, to provide such a large sum ? The Convention itself leaves this question unanswered. But just after the conclusion of the 1902 Convention the Anatolian Company is believed to have intimated to the Porte that it would accept as security for the kilometric guarantee appropriations from an increase of the Turkish customs duties, from the creation of certain monopohes, or from the unification of the Ottoman Debt (which was actually accomplished in 1903). “Nor does Article XXXV represent the whole of Turkey’s financial obligations. Under Article XXXVII the Turkish Government is to provide two further annuities of 350,000 fr. each, one for a period of thirty extent of 8,000,000 fr. on the Anatolian Company’s receipts reach given amounts, is guaranteed on the trade and agriculture. But the Anatolian Railway, like the two railways from Smyrna, has tapped the richest part of Asia Minor, and if the first two sections of the years, to cover the cost of betterment works to theX f] mu 11 lines, and another to commence as soon as the new line reaches Aleppo, for the purpose of covering the cost of express train services. “ Under various other Articles a number of minor but valuable rights are conferred upon the Company; exemption from customs dues for all materials, machinery, rolling-stock, iron, wood, coal imported from abroad during the period of construction and extension, and exemption from taxation of the Com pany’s entire property and revenue during the whole term of the Concession; mining and quarrying and forest rights within a zone of 20 kilom. on either side of the line; the right to establish warehouses, ele vators, &amp;c.; to manufacture bricks and tiles, and to make free use of any natural water power in the vicinity of the line for traction and lighting purposes; all of which tend to smooth the way for a monopoly of the economic exploitation of the country. “ The Company undertakes to make provision for postal and telegraphic services, under the control of the Ottoman Government, for the transport of troops in time of war and peace, and for the establishment, at its own expense, of the military posts required by the Ministry of War, up to a total expenditure of 4,000,000 fr., the Government, moreover, remaining at liberty to fortify all such points as it may deem neces sary. The Company also undertakes that within five years fro m the opening of each section the staff employed upon it, with the exception of the superior officials, shall be composed exclusively of Ottoman subjects. “ The constitution of the Imperial Ottoman Bagdad Railway Company, created under Article YIII of the Convention, is regulated by Statutes. The new Com pany is to have its seat at Constantinople. Whilst the Anatolian Railway Company undertakes, under Article V, to transfer to the new Company the Con cession granted to it under the 1903 Convention, it nevertheless preserves for its own exclusive benefit all rights and obligations concerning the old Anatolian Railway lines, as well as those which it derives from Articles II, XXXIII, and XXXYII of the above Convention. “ Under Article VI the initial share capital of the Company is fixed at 15,000,000 fr. “Article XII states that the Company will be administered by a Council of Administration, con sisting of eleven members, three of whom shall be nominated by the Anatolian Railway Company. The others will be appointed by the general assembly. Three members shall be Ottoman subjects. “The most important Article, however, is Article XX, under which the Council is invested with the widest powers for administering the property and affairs of the Company, ‘ et pent meme transiger et compro- mettre' For it is in virtue of these powers that the Germans, being so far in sole control, were able to: g I &lt;1 12 negotiate abroad, and make the proposals for British co-operation which His Majesty s Government ulti mately had under their consideration.’ Part III. The Anglo-Germah Negotiations of 1903. In December 1899 an Agreement was signed ^ ^O’Gonor, between the Turkish Minister of Commerce and December 27, Dr. Siemens, Director of the Deutsche Bank, lb99 - who was acting on behalf of the Anatolian Hailway Company, granting that Company a Concession for the extension of their line to Bagdad. This Agreement was eventually superseded by the Bagdad Hailway Convention of the 5th March, 1903, by which the Concession granted to the Anatolian Company was confirmed and extended. It was signed by Dr. Gwinner, President of the Deutsche Bank and successor to Dr. Siemens, and by Dr. Zander, President of the Anatolian Hailway Company, on the one side, and by the Turkish Minister of Commerce on the other. A further Agreement was signed the same sir N. O’Conor day, containing the Statutes of the Societe Impdriale Ottomane du Chemin de Per de Bagdad. Under Article V of these Statutes it is provided that the Anatolian Bailway Company, the original concessionnaire, shall transfer to the Bagdad Hailway Company (a Company intended to assume an international character) “ the Con cession which has this day been granted to it by the Ottoman Government, with all rights, privileges, and advantages attached thereto or resulting therefrom, and the new Company becomes owner and proprietor of the said Con cession, and succeeds to all the rights and obligations of the concessionnaire,” with the exception of those specially relating to the existing line (from Scutari to Konia) of the Anatolian Hailway Company. The Bagdad Hailway Concession was thus to be transferred to an international joint stock Company; and it was the wish of the German Syndicate to secure foreign, and particularly British, co-operation in financing the under taking. .Sir N. O’Conor, **o. 602, Uacember 27, 1399. Sir N. O’Conor, So. 130, April 10, 1900. Sir N. O’Conor, Iso. 145, March 26, 1902. Consideration of the Anglo-German negotia tions of 1903 may conveniently be prefaced by a short retrospect of private and official communi cations which took place between British and German Bepresentatives before that year. As early as December 1899 Dr. Siemens told His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople that he had decided, after ascertaining that there was no objection on the part of the German Government, to enlist British capital in the Bailway. With this purpose he had approached the Smyrna-Aidin Company. Although his overtures on this occasion had been unsuccessful, and he had afterwards come to an understanding with the (French) Smyrna-Cassaba Company, he hoped none the less to come to an arrange ment in course of time with British capitalists, and, in view of the opposition which the under taking would sooner or later encounter from Bussia, he considered it highly important to make the line as international as possible. On the 9th April, 1900, in the course of a conversation with Sir N. O’Conor respecting British relations with the Sheikh of Koweit, the German Ambassador stated that he was fully alive to the inadvisability of doing anything to deter British capitalists from participating in the construction of the line. In J une 1901 it was agreed that the French and German groups should take part in the project in equal shares, and, in the event of British participation, each forgo an equal percentage of the capital to be subscribed. In March 1902 certain pourparlers, which led to no definite result, took place between Lord Hillingdon (of the Ottoman Bank), on behalf of the British group, and the French Syndicate. In the same month Lord Lansdowne had a conversation with the German Ambassador, in which he explained the attitude of His Majesty’s Government:— “ The Marquess of Lansdowne to Sir F. Lascelles. “(No. 71.) li Foreign Office, « Sir, a March 18, 1902, “ I told the German Ambassador to-day triat the question of the attitude of His Majesty’s Government towards the Bagdad Railway had been a good deal discussed of late, and it might be as well that I should inform him of the purport of the answers which I had given when questioned upon the subject. [581] E14 “ We did not regard the project with unfriendly eyes ; but if it was to be carried into effect with our support and good-will, we should expect that a share, at least equal to that given to any other Power, should be given to this country in respect of the capital employed for construction of the line, of its manage ment when completed, and of its orders for materials. “ Count Metternich observed that, so far as he was aware, ‘ the door was open,’ and there was no reason why any amount of British capital should not be invested in the line. On the other hand, if it were once constructed with capital from other countries, we could not expect to be allowed to come in afterwards. “ In reply to a question from him, I said that I understood the proposal to be that the Turkish Tariff should be increased in order to provide the necessary funds for a kilometric guarantee. It would no doubt be for us to consider, when the time came, whether we were justified in consenting to such an increase, and that would depend to a great extent on the adequacy of the share assigned to us in the enterprise. , “ I am, &amp;c. (Signed) “ LANSDOWNE.” Desultory negotiations took place between the Separate Paper German Syndicate, on the one hand, and on the ^ovem- other Mr. Clinton Dawkins (on behalf of Messrs, ber 13, 1902, Morgan), Sir E. Cassel, and Lord Hillingdon during the summer and autumn of 1902. No satisfactory agreement w r as reached, and a dispute arose between the Ottoman Bank and the Deutsche Bank as to which of them should place the London shares on the market. The connection of Messrs. Morgan with the concern w r as certainly unfortunate, owing to the distrust engendered in commercial circles by their action in regard to the Atlantic Shipping Combine. In a Minute dated the 18th June, 1902, on the subject of a proposal made by Lord Eoths- child and Lord Eevelstoke that His Majesty’s Government should themselves take a part of the ordinary shares, as in the case of the Suez Canal, Lord Lansdowne observes :— “ It would, no doubt, be most unusual for a British Government to invest public money in such a project. On the other hand, the acquisition and retention by the British Government of a certain number of shares seems to be the only mode of securing for this country a permanent share in the control of the railway. If we were merely to guarantee a certain number of shares we should have no security that those shares would not find their way into the hands of foreign holders.” (I1 : 15 To Messrs. Baring, February 24, 1903. Memorandum handed to Lord Revelstoke, March 23,1903. On the 21th February, 1903, Lord Lansdowne intimated to Messrs. Baring, Sir E. Cassel, and Sir 0. Dawkins that, in his opinion, it was undesirable that the railway should he carried out without the participation of Great Britain, and His Majesty’s Government arranged that the management of the British participation in the scheme should be placed in the hands of Messrs. Baring. During the same month arrangements were made that Lord Bevelstoke, on behalf of Messrs. Baring, should represent the British group officially at a meeting fixed to be held in Paris on the 24th March, for the purpose of settling and discussing details. At this meeting Lord Bevelstoke handed to Mr. Gwinner a Memorandum fixing and em bodying the objects for which, in the opinion of the representatives of the English group present, the assistance of His Majesty’s Government might be obtained. They stood as follows :— “ § 1. To agree to a reasonable increase in the Turkish Customs Tariff, in connection with the pending negotiations for a new Commercial Treaty, and to offer no opposition to the inclusion of a portion of the increased customs revenue among the guarantees for the Bagdad Company. “ § 2. Should the new route offer substantial advan tages over existing routes for the carriage of mails to India, to make use of it for the purpose on terms to be agreed upon between His Majesty’s Government and the Company. “ § 3. To give assistance (not, of course, pecuniary) towards the provision of a terminus, with proper facili ties, at or near Koweit, and co-operate in procuring convenient customs arrangements.” Mr. Gwinner suggested that the participation should take the following form :— 25 per cent, to Germany. 25 per cent, to England. 25 per cent, to France. 10 per cent, to the Anatolian Company. 15 per cent, to minor nations. On the 7th April Lord Lansdowne had a conversation with Lord Bevelstoke and Sir E. Cassel, which is recorded in the following Memorandum:— “ I told Lord Revelstoke and Sir E. Cassel that a serious attempt was apparently being made in thepress to discredit the enterprise, and to render it impossible for His Majesty’s Government to associate themselves in any way with it, upon the ground that it w^as closely connected with the German Government and detrimental to British interests. We felt that, until we were better able to judge of the proportions which this hostile movement might assume, it would be desirable that we should avoid giving it any further encouragement. The matter would come before Parliament before the House adjourned, and we should, therefore, be better able in a few days to decide as to our future action. My own view was that the attack was founded upon misapprehensions, and I strongly deprecated any modification of the attitude which we had hitherto assumed. I wms assured by Sir E. Cassel and Lord Revelstoke that they had up to the present in no way committed His Majesty’s Government. The formula given to Lord Revelstoke on the 23rd March had been used only for the purpose of sketching ‘ suggestions ’ which might be made to His Majesty’s Government on the part of the British group, should the British and foreign groups be able to come to terms. It was in these circumstances entirely for us to decide whether we desired to proceed further, and if the negotiations were continued, nothing could be concluded either as to the constitution of the Board of Directors or as to other matters of detail until we had been thoroughly satisfied. They explained to me that, in their view, the participation was to take place upon a ‘ basis of absolute equality as between English, French, and German interests,’ and that ‘ no one group was to be given any superiority or control.’ They also explained that the Anatolian Railway would be amalgamated with the main project, and that the three members of the Board who had been described as to be nominated by the Anatolian Railway would be nominated by the whole Board. France, Germany, and England would have eight members each, and no one Power would, therefore, be able to override the wishes of the other two, which would command 16 votes out of a total of 30. (Signed) “Lansdowne. “Foreign Office, April 7, 1903.” The press campaign against the scheme was meanwhile becoming increasingly violent, and on the 23rd April a declaration was made in Parliament by the Prime Minister to the effect that His Majesty’s Government had withdrawn their support from the scheme. The nature of the press criticisms, and the extent to which they were well founded, is con sidered in the final part of this Memorandum (see p 29).mmaasmaamKBB 17 Part IV. Prospects of Completion of the Line without British Co-operation. [The quotations throughout are in £ sterling.] The length of the main line of the Bagdad Railway, from Konia to Bussorah, will he about 2,000 kilom., or 1,250 miles. The length of the extension, from Bussorah to Koweit, if ultimately decided upon, will he 160 kilom., or 100 miles. Prom Bagdad to Koweit via Bussorah, the approximate distance will be 720 kilom., or 450 miles. The construction of the line between Konia and Bussorah, 2,000 kilom., is to he executed in ten sections, each 200 kilom. in length. It is provided in Article XXXV of the Con vention that the Ottoman Government shall furnish a two-fold kilometric security, one an annuity of 11,000 fr. per kilom., built and open to traffic, the other a guarantee of 4,500 fr. per kilom. for working expenses. They correspond respectively to 700/. and 290/. per mile. Por the purposes of this Memorandum they may be described as the “ construction annuity 55 and the “ working expenses guarantee.” The construction annuity is to he capitalized and paid in Ottoman State Bonds, hearing in terest at 4 per cent, and including a sinking fund which will extinguish the loan in the period of the concession. The nominal amount of the bonds to be given to the concession-holder is 269,110 fr. 65 c. per kilom. The loan is to he guaranteed by special appro priations, such as specific tithes, to he determined before the commencement of each successive section of 200 kilom. The conditions under which the working ex penses guarantee is granted are as follows :— Until the gross receipts per kilometre (of the section concerned) reach 4,500 fr., the difference between this sum and the actual receipts will be paid by the Ottoman Government to the Company each year. When the gross kilometric receipts exceed 4,500 fr., hut have not reached 10,000 fr., the entire surplus, after 4,500 fr., goes to the Ottoman Government. When the gross kilo metric receipts surpass 10,000 fr., the above [581] Farrangement eontinues up to a total receipt of 10,000 fr., and the excess over this sum is divided between the Government and the Com pany in the proportion of 60 per cent, and 40 per cent. The working expenses guarantee is secured on and paid from the surplus of the revenues already allocated to the kilometric guarantees of the Anatolian Railway. The first section of the railway, from Konia to Eregli, was opened to traffic in October, 1904. The distance to Eregli is only 190 kilom., so the line was prolonged to Bourgourlou, 10 kilom. beyond Eregli, in order to complete the 200 kilom. The loan for the first section (Bagdad Railway, Loan, first series, 1903) was taken up at 86'40, and produced about 46,502,320 fr., or 1,860,092/. The estimates of the actual expenditure on this section show considerable discrepancy. Sir G. Clarke, in a letter and inclosure dated 7th April, 1906, estimates the cost at the rate of not less than 8,000/. per mile for construction alone, without including rolling-stock. Erom a careful comparison of available data, the cost of the first section (125 miles) would appear to have amounted to 840,000/. for rolling- stock and construction. This sum is composed as follows : — £ Rolling-stock, at rate of 1,024/. per mile .. 128,000 Construction, at rate of 5,696/. per mile .. 712,000 Total .. 840,000 The cost per mile works out:— £ Ground-work .. .. .. 1,472 Permanent-way and stations.. .. 4,224 Rolling-stock* ., .. .. 1,024 Total .. 6,720 To the cost of the first section must he added a sum of 172,000/. spent in faux-frais to Turkish officials and in surveys over the whole line. It is believed that the “ backsheesh for the wdiole Concession was defrayed out of the profits on this section. Estimating, therefore, the total expenditure at 1,012,000/., and deducting it from the product of the first loan (1,860,092/.), there remains a balance of 818,092/. Of this about 400,000/., certainly not less, was constituted into a reserve fund for later sections, and the rest was distributed. * The Estimate for rolling-stock is based on the informa* tion supplied by three independent local experts,An alternative estimate to the above may be found in the contract price with Messrs. Hetz- mann and Company, of Frankfort, which was 8,512Z. for ground-work, permanent-'way, and rolling-stock. The balance of opinion is that this is above the price actually paid. The length of the section being 125 miles, the amount under this estimate works out at 1,064,000/.; hut this estimate omits all mention of surveys and “ back sheesh ” included in the total of 1,012,000/. given above. In any case, it is calculated that there is a reserve fund of about 400,000/. towards the next section. The next section (usually described as Eregli to Adana, hut really from Bourgourlou to a point 26 kilom. beyond Adana) is by far the most difficult from an engineering point of view. From kilom. 200 to 220 the gradient is 15 metres per kilom. From kilom. 220 to 320 it varies between 16 and 17 metres. From kilom. 320 to 400 it is apparently less. In the section of 200 kilom. there are thirteen bridges of from 10 to 90 metres, of which the total length is nearly 500 metres; and 32 tunnels of from 20 to 1,440 metres, of a total length of nearly 9J kilom. There are, therefore, 10 kilom. or 6J miles of bridging and tunnelling on this section, and there will he in addition an enormous amount of blasting and some side-tunnelling, besides several cuttings through bed-rock. There are 50 “ difficult ” and 75 relatively “ easy ” miles on this section. It is estimated that the ground-work of the former will work out at 38,400/. per mile. This, for the 50 miles, amounts to 1,920,000/. The ground-work of the “ easy ” portion works out at 2,560/. per mile, or 192,000/. for the 75 miles. The ground-work for the whole section of 125 miles is thus estimated to cost 2,112,000/. The estimate for the permanent-way and stations is at the uniform rate of 4,224/. per mile, which for 125 miles works out at 528,000/. The total construction cost for this section will then amount to 2,112,000/. plus 528,000/., or 2,640,000/., and to this must again he added 128,000/. for rolling-stock at the rate of 1,024/. per mile. The grand total for the section will therefore amount to 2,768,000/. If taken up at 86’40, the loan for this section would produce about 46,502,320 fr., or 1,860,092/.20 There will therefore be a deficit of 907,908/. on this section. This deficit may be reduced to 507,908/. by haying recourse to the reserve fund of 400,000/. on the first section. The balance of the deficit may be met by undertaking the construction of three sections at once. It is estimated that the third and fourth sectionseach 125 miles (200 kilom.) in length, will not cost more than the first. Two figures were given as alternative estimates for the cost of the first section, namely, 6,720/. and 8,512/. per mile. Eor the sake of prudence the higher of these two figures may be taken. The cost of the third and fourth sections w T ill thus be 8,512/. X 250, which is 2,128,000/. If the loan is issued at the same price as the first (86*40), it will produce a net sum of 3,720,184/. The profit on the two sections will therefore be 1,592,184/. The deficit on the second section (Eregli- Adana) has been calculated at 507,908/., as above. The ultimate profit on the construction of the second, third, and fourth sections will therefore be 1,084,276/. The remaining sections (six of 200 kilom.) to Bussorah are not believed to present any great or very cosily engineering difficulties, although the ground is stated in certain districts to be some what marshy. The distance is 1,200 kilom., or 750 miles. At the rate of 8,512/. per mile this works out at 6,384,000/. The construction annuities, when capitalised on the basis, and if taken up at the price (86*40) indicated above (see page 17), will produce a net sum of 11,160,552/. Cor 1,200 kilom. The profit on the last six sections will thus be 4,776,552/., which, together with the profit on the second, third, and fourth sections (1,084,276/.) will show a total profit on the line of 5,860,828/. An examination of the available revenues will show that the promoters of the railway need not feel great anxiety as to the provision of securities for the kilometric guarantees. In the first place, there is the surplus of the tithes collected by the Debt amounting to 270,000/. The surplus of the revenues collected by the Debt, of which 75 per cent, revert to the * Mr. Wigham, in his book “ The Persian Problem,” much exaggerates the engineering difficulties of the third section. (Government, represent another 270,000/., and this sum is considered likely to increase. 111,475/. of the last-named amount is, however, already assigned to the Ottoman Bank Loan of 2,500,000/. (not yet issued). It would seem that from these sources sufficient money can he found for raising the construction capital. If the Germans do not obtain, as they desire, the assignment of the surplus revenues of the Debt, the Government will probably be called upon, particularly if the imposition of the 3 per cent. Customs surtax is arranged, to assign fresh tithes. It should be borne in mind, however, that as soon as the Konia-Eregli section is linked to the Mediterranean seaboard the profits of the line will increase, and the working guarantee for that section will diminish in proportion, and may he utilized towards guaranteeing the con struction annuity for the further sections. Nevertheless, if new tithes are required, it is stated that the Government have them at their disposal. The tithes of the Empire give 4,320,000/. in round figures per annum. The amount assigned already for kilometric guarantees is 1,530,000/., leaving a balance of 2,790,000/. If they are placed in the hands of the Debt administration, it is calculated that by a better system of collection they would yield 20 per cent. more. The Government could also still further pledge the Aghnam or sheep tax. It produces 1,778,400/., of which 146,430/. is already pledged, leaving a balance of 1,631,970/. The system of collection is in course of improvement. It is, indeed, evident that the Ottoman Govern ment cannot indefinitely continue on this course of pledging the best revenues of the country, and that a deficit in the National Exchequer will necessarily result. At the present time there would appear to be insufficient revenue to meet current expenditure, the internal finances are in great disorder, and daily expenses are increasing by leaps and bounds owing to the general ex travagance of Ottoman administration. The creation of fresh debt, and the assignment of fresh revenues for the service of new loans— the policy of the Erench Syndicates—and the appropriation of fresh revenues for the construc tion of railways—the policy of the German Syndicates—must eventually lead to disaster, and [581] Gconsequently to extended control by the Debt administration. It may be that the French and German Syndicates realize that the crisis must come sooner or later, and prefer to hasten rather than retard it. An explanation of Germany’s wish for foreign co-operation may possibly be sought in the fear of this crisis; it being perhaps her hope to associate other Powers in the work of instituting an efficient system of European control over the Ottoman financial administration in all its branches in the event of such a crisis arising. According to Article XXXY of the Convention of 1903, the working expenses guarantee of 4,500 fr. per kilom. is to be paid from the surplus of the tithes at present assigned for payment of the kilometric guarantees of the Anatolian Railway Company. The average surplus for the five years ended 1904 is 44,616/. In 1905,22,739/. was paid in kilometric guaran tees towards the working of the Konia-Eregli section. With the tacit consent of the Government, and by an arrangement between the various railway Companies, the deficit in the sums assigned for the payment of kilometric guaran tees on any one or more lines in Turkey is covered by the surplus on the other lines. The average surplus for the five years ended 1904 of the tithes in question, including the revenues assigned for the Osmanie and Fisheries Loans, which also come into the Agreement, was 206,763/. This Agreement does not extend to the Bagdad line. If there is a deficit on that line, it can only be made good from the surplus on the Anatolian lines, and not from the surplus of the kilometric guarantees in general. An arrangement might, however, easily be come to on this point. It would require the consent of the Government and an understanding between the French and German lines. If the French entered the Bagdad Railway scheme such an arrangement might be concluded. Thus, in any case, there is a sum of 44,616/. per annum available for the Bagdad Railway, and if a further arrangement, as mentioned, is come to, there will be a surplus of 206,763/. available. Further, the surplus of the Fisheries loan—a German loan—amounts to over 50,400/., and might be earmarked for the railway. Moreover, the existing sections of the Anatolian line have caused, and will continue to cause, amamBmammrn 23 steady and permanent increase in the tithes of the districts through which they pass. The general conclusion from the above statistics is that, from financial considerations, British co-operation will certainly not be a sine qua non of the construction of the railway, more especially if Trench capitalists continue, as at present, to take part in the scheme. A full survey of the line has not, however, yet been carried out, nor has any estimate of the cost of railway guards in the disturbed districts been prepared. There is the further element of a possible default on the part of the Ottoman Government, and of the crisis which would ensue. There is, therefore, reason to suppose that Germany is averse to taking all the financial as well as political responsibilities of this great enterprise, and would welcome British and Trench co-operation. Yet, if she is obliged to go on single-handed, she will not, it would seem, be deterred, in spite of the financial difficulties of the Turkish Treasury, and of the obstacles which may he placed in the way of establishing a terminus at Koweit. •i -j l Bart Y. The Ineluence oe the Bailway on British Interests. Board of Trade Memorandum, June 1905. A railroad which owes its existence to an elaborate system of Government subsidies, and is destined to form a direct line of communica tion between the German Empire and the shores of the Persian Gulf, must be regarded in the light of no ordinary commercial venture. The promoters of this scheme have proclaimed their policy of supplanting British trade in a region where till recently competition was non existent. The trade of Bussorah and Bagdad, valued at 2,500,000/. in 1903, has been a virtual monopoly of Great Britain and India; 50 per cent, of the river transport between these two towns has been effected in British bottoms j and of the total steam-ship tonnage entered in 1900 at Bussorah, 96 per cent, was British. Nor is24 the trade influence of the railway likely to he confined within the Mesopotamian vilayets, for its completion under German auspices bids fair to ruin British commerce with South-M estern Persia, and, in regard to one route alone, to involve an annual loss of 750,000/. If these facts are considered in conjunction with the projected economic penetration of a country, hitherto regarded as a possible outlet for the surplus populations of India, then, indeed, the Bagdad Bailway Scheme appears fraught, in its commercial aspects alone, with potential consequences of a most serious and far- reaching character. In a review of the circumstances which led in 1903 to the refusal of His Majesty’s Government to lend the enterprise their support, His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople thus sums up his conclusions:— “Nor must it be forgotten that the Railway Conces sion carries with it many valuable privileges and advantages. Apart from the large orders for materials for railway construction, &amp;c., it secures extensive mining rights on each side of the line, the right of navigation of the Tigris and Euphrates during the construction of the railway, a Concession which will probably be unlimitedly extended, a commercial outlet either at Koweit or elsewhere in the Persian Gulf, an exception ally favourable position in the future for all enterprise connected with the irrigation of Mesopotamia, &amp;c. Moreover, it can hardly be supposed that no effort will be made to supplant British navigation in its privileged position in the Persian Gulf, and to take advantage of the opportunity to compete with British shipping in those waters. “ It is also to be feared that the preponderance of foreign Powers in the valley of the Tigris will react upon British influence in Western Persia in the same way as England’s exclusion from a public enterprise so intimately connected with the progress and develop ment of the country will affect her prestige and position throughout Asia Minor.” On the oth May, 1903, Lord Lansdowne made a declaration in the House of Lords to the following effect:— “ It is owing to British enterprise, to the expenditure of British lives and money, that the Persian Gulf is at this moment open to the navigation of the world. It was our ships that cleared those waters of pirates; it was we who put down the Slave Trade; it was we who buoyed and beaconed those intricate waters .... and, although we certainly could not aim at excluding Sir N. O’Conor, No. 217, April 28, 19&lt;&gt;3.the legitimate trade of other nations, this country- stands with regard to the navigation of the Gulf in a position different from that of any other Power, and our policy should be directed to protect and promote British trade in those waters.” It would be difficult to contend that this policy is finding practical application, if a railway, calculated to dominate the principal markets of the Persian Gulf, is gratuitously abandoned to the control of an energetic and powerful rival; and the co-operation of Great Britain, as a measure of self-protection, would appear imperative, even if the contingency of financial difficulty cannot be altogether excluded. But it is not upon commercial considerations alone that the advent of a German railway must occasion concern. In an oft-quoted article, which appeared in the “ National Beview ” of September 1902, Captain Mahan, U.S.N., expressed his views of British policy in the Gulf in the following sentence :— “ Concession in the Persian Gulf, whether by formal arrangement with other Powers or by neglect of the local commercial interests which now underlie political and military control, will imperil Great Britain’s naval situation in the Far East, her political position in India, her commercial interests in both, and the Imperial tie between herself and Australasia.” The General Staff, in a Memorandum (45 B) of the 15th November, 1904, “pointed out the disadvantages—political, commercial, and stra tegic—which the control by Germany of a line to the Persian Gulf would entail upon Great Britain.” At a meeting of the Imperial Defence Com mittee held on the 12 th April, 1905, the conclu sion was recorded “that it is important that England should have a share in the control of the extension of the Bagdad Bailway to the Persian Gulf, with a view to insuring the effective neutralization of the terminus.” In a Memorandum prepared for the Committee of Imperial Defence by Sir G. Clarke, on the 26th January, 1905, it is observed:— “ We are therefore confronted with a project which if carried out under German auspices, will undoubtedly inflict grave injury upon our commerce, and must ultimately destroy our political influence in Southern Persia and in the deltas of the Tigris and Euphrates. [581] HammaBmmm 26 We have the strongest grounds for preventing the control of a railway from Bagdad to the Gulf from falling wholly under the control of a Power which regards its own interests exclusively, and which well understands the manipulation of 1 ’ailway rates.” While such is a summary of authoritative statements in regard to the detrimental effects upon British interests of a railway placed under the exclusive control of a great military and industrial nation, the balance of opinion would appear to favour the view that, if the line were made a joint concern, or to he internationalized, the damage to British prestige would not be so evident, and that to military interests consider ably modified, while the competition to commerce would he rather stimulating than destructive. The various conditions which, in the event of British participation in the scheme, are considered of importance, and practical suggestions for the conclusion of an international arrangement on the subject, are set forth in some detail in the sub joined Memorandum, which was prepared by Sir G. Clarke in August 1905 :— “ If the construction of the line is proceeded with, our object must be to secure the control of the Bussorah- Bagdad section. “ It seems possible that Germany might be induced to yield that condition if we met her in other directions. “ M. Cambon, in a recent conversation with Lord Lansdowne, expressed the opinion that the French Government would not favour this proposal, but it is doubtful whether the French Government has given full consideration to the subject. ‘‘At present Germany has complete control over the Anatolian Bail way, and France has a monopoly of railway construction in Syria as far south as Mezerib. “ British control of the Bussorah-Bagdad section might fairly be regarded as a legitimate counterpoise to the French and German railways in Syria and Asia Minor respectively. “In view of our present cordial relations with the French Government, it seems probable that, if repre sentations were made, no opposition would be offered to the proposal that we should control this section of the line, more particularly as we should undertake not to establish differential tariffs in our own favour. &lt;• It is clear from the former negotiations that the German Government is strongly averse from the inter nationalization of the Anatolian Railway. We might without serious disadvantage consent to the Anatolian Railway remaining under German control, provided that we were given control of the Bussorah-Bagdad section, ► f f 127 and that the 10 per cent, participation and share in the directorate by the Anatolian Railway of the Bagdad Railway previously stipulated for were withdrawn. “ France, Germany, England, and the minor Powers might then combine to participate in the construction, on an international basis, of that part of the Bagdad Railway which lies between Konieh and Bagdad (about 900 miles), together with any branches that might be constructed between these two points, such as those to Alexandretta and Aleppo. “ The Board of the international section might be composed in the following proportion :— Country. Percentage. Great Britain 30 France ... 30 Germany 30 Minor nations 10 Total 100 “ Or, it there is any possibility of inducing the United States to participate, the proportion might be :— Country. Percentage. Great Britain 22 United States 22 France ... 22 Germany 22 Minor nations 12 Total 100 “ Provision would have to be made to secure to participants proportionate shares in the provision of railway materiel for the international portion of the line. It would further be desirable that arrangements should be made to pool the receipts of the German, French, English, and International Companies, and that a mutual guarantee should be given by all the Companies that they will not establish discriminating tariffs in favour of or against the trade of individual nations. “ Such arrangements would concede to the Germans a point which they were clearly unwilling to yield in the former negotiations ; and, provided that access to Alexandretta by the international line is assured, the Germans, even if they evaded the Agreement by granting rebates on the Anatolian Railway to German traders, would not be able to injure our trade on any section of the line to Konieh, as goods arriving via the Mediterranean would be sent to Konieh as cheaply by Alexandretta as by Haidar Pasha. “An arrangement of the nature described above would require the establishment of a clearing-house charged with the duty of apportioning receipts and expenditure on through traffic. The management ofthe clearing-house would be in the hands of a Mixed Committee of the several Boards. “ If the entire system could be placed under bond fide international control, British interests would be adequately safeguarded, but the difficulties appear insuperable. It is extremely unlikely that the Germans would consent to internationalize the Ana tolian Railway, while the French would probably object strongly to a similar arrangement in regard to the Syrian lines. “On the whole, the arrangement above suggested seems the most practical at the present time, and it might be desirable to sound the French Government on the subject. “ The following is a summary of the proposals :— “ (a.) Germany to retain control and management of the Anatolian Railway. “ (b.) France to retain control and management of the Syrian railways. “ (c.) Great Britain to construct, control, and manage the Bagdad Gulf section. “ (d.) The intervening section, with branches and connections, to be internationalized. “ (e.) The international section to be controlled by a Board on which the Great Powers are equally represented. “(/.) Materials for the international section to be provided by the Powers in proportion to their financial participation. The Powers to undertake not to impose differential rates on the sections they severally control. “ (Ji.) The receipts on the entire system to be pooled and distributed by a clearing-house managed by a Committee from the several Boards.” In addition to the above-mentioned conditions, Article XXIX of the Bagdad Bailway Convention would have to he so modified as to admit the working of the Bagdad Gulf section as soon as completed. In the opinion of the Board of Trade it is also essential that the waterways in this region, as well as the railroad, should be under British control, not only in order to facilitate the work of construction, hut also to prevent the Turkish steamers on the Tigris from undercutting the railway freights. Down-stream rates are some times as low as \d. per ton per mile, whereas the lowest freight rates on the Anatolian Bail way in 1902-1903 averaged -fd. Board of Trade Memorandum, June 1905.29 Sir N. O’Uouor No. 217, April 28, 1903. It remains to consider the causes of the violent outburst in the press, which, in 1903, rendered the negotiations with Germany abortive, and which, in the event of a renewal of negotiations at the present time, would not improbably occasion much anxiety in regard to their success. This popular indignation, as in the case of the proposed joint action by England and Germany against Venezuela,' was due to the suspicions with which the public viewed any co-operation between this country and Germany a state of mind which had gradually grown up owing to the conviction that Germany could no longer be considered as a friendly Power. This feeling received its fullest confirmation by the attitude of Germany during the South African War. It was also due to misapprehension as to the conditions under which it was proposed to enlist British capital, and, indeed, as to the ability of Germany to utilize the Concession single-handed. Motives of sentimental aversion constitute no sufficient reason for refusal to engage in business which can be shown, on investigation, to he bene ficial to the parties concerned. On the other hand, those considerations which led, on practical grounds, to substantial objections on the part of the investing public are of practical significance, and accordingly deserving of the most careful attention. Into this subject His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople entered at considerable length in a despatch dated the 28th April, 1903:— “ It is to be regretted that misapprehensions have been caused by incomplete or incorrect publication of the documents in the case. The Concession for the Bagdad Railway was obtained in the first instance by the Anatolian Railway Company. It is therefore natural that, in the Convention of the 5th March, 1903, embodying this Concession, that Company appears as the concessionnaire of all rights and privileges in question. It does not, however, remain in possession of these rights. Under Article 5 of the Statutes of the ‘ Societe Imperiale Ottomcme du Chemin de Fer de Bagdad’ it is provided that the Anatolian Railway Company shall transfer to the new Company ‘the Concession which has been granted to it by the Imperial Ottoman Government, with all rights, privileges, and advantages attached thereto or re sulting therefrom, and the new Company becomes owner and proprietor of the said Concession, and [581] Isucceeds to all the rights and obligations of the con- cessionnaire,’ with the exception of those specially relating to the existing line of the Anatolian Railway Coropany “ The result of the constitution [of the Board of the new Company, as proposed in 1903] would be that any two of the groups [German, French, and English] could command an absolute majority, and that the Company would be really international in the sense that it would be impossible to direct its policy and working to the benefit of any single country at the expense of the others. “ It has been represented that the Railway could be worked in a manner detrimental to British commerce by means of direct or indirect advantages, of special rates, through rates, rebates, or exemptions accorded to the goods of other countries, or to goods arriving by particular routes. This apprehension is not well founded. Such preferences are directly prohibited by Articles 24 and 25 of the ‘ Cahier des Charges ’ of the Bagdad Railway, and by corresponding provisions applicable to the Anatolian Railway. They would also be excluded by a clause of the proposed Treaty of Commerce; and, in any case, the execution of these stipulations in the spirit, as well as in the letter, could undoubtedly be secured by the participation of British capital and the consequent international character of the Company. “ It has been pointed out, in the course of the dis cussions in the press and elsewhere, that, so long as the Anatolian Railway from Haidar Pasha to Konia remains in German hands, the international character of the line from Konia onwards will not be a sufficient guarantee for impartial treatment; that the German Company will, in fact, hold the key of the door by which the through traffic must pass. This is a point of the first importance, deserving careful consideration ; but an examination of the whole position will go far, at any rate, to dispel any anxiety on this account. In the first place, the representatives of the Anatolian Railway Company have formally announced their readiness to vest the control of their line in the Inter national Company at some future period; and there are sufficient guarantees for the carrying out of this undertaking in the fact that it would be open to the British Government, in the event of failure to carry it out, to refuse the promised facilities for a port in the Persian Gulf, and to withdraw their assurance as to conveyance of the Indian mails; and also in the fact that, when the Bagdad line has been completed throughout the greater part of its length, it would be so indispensable to the prosperity of the Anatolian line that the latter could not afford to take up a hostile or exclusive attitude. This is the more certain since Haidar Pasha does not afford the only point of access. * * *- *“ Fears have been expressed that at one moment or another either Germany or France, or possibly both countries, may, for political reasons, come to terms with Russia and find it in their interest to make over their share, or else to buy off her hostility by supporting her claims for Russian access to the shores of the Persian Gulf. These are contingencies, however, which might arise in any case, whether England participates or not in the construction of the Railway. Indeed, an arrangement with Russia would be more urgently required, and at the same time more easy of accomplishment, if England stands out than if she participates.” The principal contentions of the press in regard to the inadvisability of British participa-' tion are dealt with in the extracts from Sir N. O’Conor’s despatch, but particular capital was made out of certain assurances which were requested from His Majesty’s Government in the event of a basis of co-operation being agreed upon. The assurances in question were as follows:— 1. That objection should not be raised to the increase of the Turkish customs duties, of which a part should be used in guarantees for the Bagdad Bail way. 2. That if the Bail way should prove a sub stantially better route for conveying the mails to India, it should receive the subsidy at present granted to British steam-ship lines. 3 . That His Majesty’s Government should lend their good offices in providing a proper terminus at or near Koweit. The first and third points are now devoid of practical interest, since the increase of the customs is in process of arrangement, and the additional revenue is to be devoted to the lequiie- ments of Macedonian reform; while a British officer, dispatched to the Persian Gulf on a special mission to carry out surveys on the spot, has recently reported that Koweit is by no means the only convenient terminus, various places, outside the limits of any possible extension of British protection, being equally suitable for the purpose in view. The second point is one of considerable importance. It is, however, merely a question of degree, and it may be doubted whether the32 compensatory gains to British trade as a whole would not, in the long run, outweigh the immediate loss incurred by the mercantile marine.

Herr von Stumm stated that the German Government were anxious that we should take no action with Russia in regard to the Bagdad Railway without first consulting them. Sir C. Hardinge, who received him in my absence, replied that His Majesty’s Government never had any intention of ignoring German rights, especially as it would be useless to do so, in view of the fact that the Concession for the Bagdad Railway was in the hands of a German bank. Herr von Stumm then observed—and this apparently was the real object of his visit—that he could assure us that any proposals from His Majesty’s Government to participate in the Bagdad Railway scheme would be very favourably received in Berlin, but that the initiative could not come from the German Government. Sir C. Hardinge informed him that he was pleased to hear this, but that the question was still under discussion, and could not be unduly hurried for fear of provoking an outburst of hostile public opinion, as had already been the case three vears ago.

Dr. Zander had told him that the Germans saw their way to construct the next two sections of the Bagdad Railway, but beyond that they were not prepared to go alone. For them to construct a railway to the Persian Gulf, which might meet with the opposition of Russia and England, would be too great an undertaking. They wished, therefore, for English co-operation, and recognized that, in order to have it, England must control the southern section of the line. I observed that we did not appear to have so great an interest in seeing the line made as to encourage us to incur the hostility of Russia either, and that if this was the German view it was obvious that the participation of Russia ought to be desired. I further observed that the southern section of the line would, as at present arranged, go through a very unprofitable part of the country. Mr. Braham said that Dr. Zander was quite aware of this, and admitted that the route to be taken by the line would have to be altered. BAGDAD RAILWAY. [ B ] [June 14.] CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1.

Isvolsky on the subject of an arrangement in regard to Thibet, but that I had not done more than explain to his Excellency the outline of the Conventions which had been concluded with that country and China, and that I had communicated to him privately certain points which might form the basis of future discussions. I told M. Bompard privately that M. Isvolsky appeared chiefly anxious on two questions: the future position of the Dalai Lama, and the intention of China to assert and consolidate her position in Mongolia. M. Isvolsky, I said, had spoken to me at some length on both these questions, but that when my interview was concluded he had begged me not to telegraph to my Government any of the views which he had expressed, as, on further study and reflection, he might feel disposed to alter them. This method of procedure might, I feared, be a little irksome if continually repeated. M. Bompard told me that he himself had observed that M. Isvolsky, though ready to converse freely, was nervous lest his statements should be taken as a positive declaration of his views, and was always careful to explain that what he had said should not be interpreted as the opinions of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. He was, M. Bompard remarked, “ tres fuyant,” and he had himself had an instance of this in a conversation which he had held on the subject of Russian co-operation in the Bagdad Railway. M. Isvolsky had on that occasion expressed his entire concurrence with the proposal, but had at the close of the interview receded from the views which he had enunciated. I think that this hesitation will very possibly disappear when M. Isvolsky has been a little longer in office, and has rendered himself more fully acquainted with the multifarious questions with which he has to deal. As regards the Bagdad Railway, M. Bompard said, as Mr. Spring-Rice has already reported, that the Chief of the Staff had no objections to Russian co-operation, but that M. Isvolsky had intimated that the Minister of Finance was opposed to Russian participation, fearing lest heavy responsibilities and charges should be thrown upon the Russian Treasury. M. Bompard intended to take an opportunity of explaining to the Minister of Finance that the Russian Government would not be required to contribute capital, as this was a matter for banks and financial houses to undertake. His fears as to the responsibility of the Russian Treasury were, therefore, needless. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) A. NICOLSON. [2038 s—1][This Document is the Property of His Brij | Jo (0$ ( Jh-A*V*JC.

Sir, Foreign Office, June 15, 1906. I TOLD M. Cambon to-day what the “Times” Constantinople ^correspondent had told me of his conversation with Dr. Zander about the Bagdad Railway, i.e., that the Germans were prepared to make the next two sections of the Bagdad Railway themselves, getting through the Taurus Mountains and reaching Syria, but they were not prepared to make the rest of the line without our co-operation, and they assumed the condition of our co-operation would be the control of the southern end. I observed to M. Cambon that this assumption that we must have the exclusive control of the southern end had reached me, more than once, from German sources. But I had not hitherto got so far as to stipulate for or define any special conditions on our behalf. All I had had in my mind was an enterprise under international control. I did not think it was in the British interest specially to promote or encourage the construction of the Bagdad Railway, though I should not like to see a railway made to the Persian Gulf in which we did not participate. I was, therefore, not at all prepared to create friction with Russia by making special conditions in connection with the Bagdad Railway which might alienate Russian co-operation. More than one hint had been given to us that the Germans would like us to make a proposal with regard^ to the Bagdad Railway. I did not intend to make any proposal. My present opinion was that if the Germans made any proposal to us I had better point out to them that, though we were not opposed to the Bagdad Railway, Ave should want to see it made by international agreement, and the Germans had better consider how ussia might be brought into the enterprise. M. Cambon considered the information Avhich _ had been given me as very interesting, and asked if he might communicate it to his Government. . , I said he might do this, provided he made it clear how the information had reached me, and that it Avas unofficial.

Sir Edward Grey to Sir F. Bertie. (No. 287.) Foreign Office, May 29, 1906. M. GAMBON told me to-day that the understanding between the French and German groups of financiers interested in the Bagdad Railway still remained, and if England, France, and Russia were _ to come to an agreement as to the terms on which they were willing to participate in the Railway, it would be easy for the French financial group to reopen the question with the Germans on the terms to which these three Powers might have agreed. He thought this would be the most convenient way of reopening the question. He said that there would be difficulty in making any arrangement by which the southern section should be entirely controlled by England. The placing of one section under the control of a particular Power might give rise to difficult questions respecting the control of other sections, and would not be altogether in accordance with the general character of an international undertaking. In addition to this, he was sure that the Sultan would never agree to a concession of this section being given to England alone. I said that statements had appeared in the press to the effect that we should stipulate for this or that condition as essential to our co-operation, but that these statements had not come from the Foreign Office. As a matter of fact, that to which we attached most importance was that the line should be really international. If this was secured by the co-operation of France, Russia, and Germany, as well as ourselves, I did not think difficulties would be raised by us with regard to the control of a particular section. M. Gambon said the Russian Government were very much preoccupied with the Duma, but M. Nelidoff had just gone to St. Petersburg!!, and he was thoroughly conversant with the whole question. I am, &amp;c.

The German Foreign Office, which a few days ago denied the truth of the rumours which were circulating in usually well-informed quarters regarding the prospects of an international agreement on the Bagdad Railway, is now in possession of information which leads it to take a hopeful view of the possibility of an under standing in this question between the German and British financiers. . , That an agreement has already been arrived at as asserted in to-day’s newspapers is described to me as premature, but I am given to understand that the Government is watching with sympatny the discussions which are now taking place between London and Berlin financiers.Register No. fl? / v Minute Paper.

Izvolsky told me yesterday that the news as regarded the Shah’s health was better. There therefore appeared to be no present reason to take serious steps. He said that he had no doubt Mr. Grant Duff had already received instructions to act jointly with his Russian colleague in support of the Vali Ahd’s succession to the throne. He had himself sent corresponding instructions to the Russian Charge d’Affaires at Tehran. I observed that it might be advisable that the two Legations should have a certain sum at their disposal in order to conciliate the troops, and induce them to maintain their allegiance to the Vali Ahd on the death of the Shah. On the occasion of the present Shah’s accession the question of a largesse to the troops had proved a serious one, and it was as well that the two Governments should be prepared to take steps if necessary. He agreed in principle, and said that M. Hartwig, who left yesterday for his post, had spoken to him on the subject. Had I any instruc tions in regard to the matter ? I mentioned the conversation which you had with the Russian Ambassador on the 11th instant, in which you had spoken as to the possibility of a joint loan. He said that he had received a report of this conversation, and that he was quite agreed in principle with the opinions you had expressed, at the same time the information at his disposal was not sufficiently definite to warrant a decision. He had the whole subject under his consideration, and would inform you later when he had been able to master the subject. He then proceeded to say that the German Ambassador had called upon him to make a communication on the subject of the information published in the “ Standard ” as to a supposed Anglo-Russian entente. Her von Schoen had said that, so far as such an understanding made for the peace of world, Germany could only hail it with satis faction. With regard to one point only he had an observation to make—this was that part of the published basis of the Agreement which concerned the Bagdad Railway. This was the subject of a Concession granted by the Sultan to the Deutsche Bank, and was therefore specifically a German interest, as to which Germany had every right to be consulted. M. Izvolsky had, he said, immediately telegraphed the substance of this conversation to London in order that it might be en toute franchise communicated to you. He regarded the communication as satisfactory, as it showed that Germany had, as a matter of fact, no objection to an entente between England and Russia. With regard to the Bagdad Railway, he considered that the contention of Germany was just, and that German claims ought to be considered. I said that you had never left any room for doubt in all your communications on the subject, or in the communications made through Sir Charles Hardinge, that in seeking an agreement with Russia His Majesty’s Government was aiming at an agreement which made for peace, and not an agreement to be directed against the interests of any third Power. AVith regard to the Bagdad Railway, the question was whether or no Great Britain should participate, in common with France, in the enterprise inaugurated by Germany. We had hitherto refused the German offer to participate mainly because we were not willing, as long as Russia was opposed to the project, to enter into a combination which Russia might regard as an unfriendly act. Should Russia withdraw her objections, we should, in common with France, be more willing to give a favourable answer to the German proposals for financial participation, if in other respects they appeared satisfactory. There was no question of acting in the matter without considering Germany, which, indeed, as the Concession Avas a German one, was impossible. M. Izvolsky said that at first sight he thought that the views expressed by you to Count Benckendorff were such as he could recommend to the Emperor, but he was unable to give a definite answer until the competent authorities had been consulted. I subsequently spoke to the French Ambassador on the subject. His Excellency said that he had not mentioned the matter of the Anglo-Russian negotiations to M. Izvolsky as he thought that it would be wiser to wait until he was more sure of his ground. M. Izvolsky had not spoken to him of the communication made by the [1990 ee — 2 ]2 German Ambassador. On the subject of the Bagdad Railway he had spoken to M. Izvolsky, Count Witte, and the Director of the General Staff. The former had given a favourable answer in principle, but had reserved a definite reply until he should have consulted the competent authorities. Count Witte had informed him that on reconsideration he had changed his mind with regard to the matter, and was now prepared to recommend Russia to withdraw her opposition. The same answer had been received from the military authorities, who no longer appeared to consider that the construction of the line was injurious to Russia’s military interests. M. Bompard said that the Director of the Deutsche Bank at Constantinople had approached Sir Nicholas O’Conor with regard to the participation of English capital, and that he had subsequently proceeded to Paris, where he had made a similar proposal with regard to French participation to the Directors of the Ottoman Bank. It was noticeable however, that the offers had been solely made with regard to financial participation, and the inducements put forward were solely those incident on the issue of a loan in Paris Nothing bad been said either of the industrial advantages incident on construction or on political or commercial control, or participation in control. With regard to the general question M. Bompard made the following remarks- The denial of the intention to offer a loan to Persia, if made by Germany, would correspond exactly to Count Tattenbach’s similar denial of the intention to make an advance to Morocco, a denial which did not, as a matter of fact, prevent Germany making an arrangement which was hardly distinguishable from a loan. The steps taken by the Director of the Deutsche Bank pointed to the desire of Germany to obtain French capital, but they also pointed to the desire of Germany to restrict French co-operation to one of a purely financial nature. The Government, however, could not and would not participate without giving due consideration to the general, commercial and political aspects of the question. \\ ith regard to the question of the observations made by Herr von Schoen as to a rapprochement between England and Russia, similar friendly observations had been made as to the rapprochements made between Italy and France, between Austria and Uussia, and between France and England. But it was not to be denied that in all these cases Germany had been untiring in her efforts to destroy the force of all these agreements, while protesting publicly that she regarded them with favour. M. Bompard therefore considered that, while accepting with satisfaction the friendly sentiments of Germany, the two Governments should not lose sight of the fact that the advice and assistance of Germany would not always and invariably be given with a view to the furtherance of harmony. The two Governments should act for themselves accoiding to their own interests. They should, of course, make it plain that their e torts to come to a mutual agreement did not and could not entail any consequences injurious to any Power which sincerely desired peace. But they should act not t no ugh intermediaries, but directly, unless they were anxious to pay somewhat heavy brokerage. % ^ ( pointed out further that, as regards the Bagdad Railway, it was not advisable at t )e three Powers (France, England, and Russia) should act separately, by separate ana independent negotiations, with Germany. They should act as a unit, and if they ic so tie terms obtained would be better. For this purpose it was most necessary tfiat they should come to a common understanding as soon as possible. This he said, not with any hostile feeling towards Germany, but from the purely business point He added that, although, as he had told me, he had not thought it advisable as yet o speak on the subject of Anglo-Russian relations, which he had abstained from doing, because he was not yet sufficiently clear as to the policy which would be pursued by the new Government, and because in principle he thought it was better that Russia and England should fight out their battle by themselves, on the ground ot their own private interests and without foreign interference, yet His Majesty’s Embassy might rest assured that they might count on the friendly and willing co-operation of their French co eagues m case any question of friction should arise which could be usefully aplani by the offices of a mutual friend. L said 1 was sure that in the future, as in the past, ns f lendly offices would be appealed to if the occasion arose. I have, &amp;c.

O’Conor to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received May 21.) (No. 330. Very Confidential.) Sir, Constantinople, May 14, 1906. THE following observations on the prospects of the Bagdad Railway, recently made to a friend by M. Testa, who, as German Delegate on the Ottoman Public Debt and ex-First Dragoman of the German Embassy, is well acquainted with the question in all its financial and political aspects, are of considerable interest. The German Engineers have carefully studied the problem of an alternative route for the railway, so as to avoid the immense and costly work of the “trace” laid down in the Concession, and have arrived at the conclusion that the proposed route, with some modifications, is the most feasible. The idea of crossing the range further west, and linking the line with the existing Mersina-Adana railway has been abandoned, partly because it is little less difficult than the Eregli-Adana route, but principally because the line, as originally sanctioned by the Sultan, was laid down so as to be safe from attack from the sea, and His Imperial Majesty would never assent to a deviation which would bring the railway to the south side of the Taurus for so long a distance. The contemplated project for commencing work on the sections east of Adana and leaving the Taurus section untouched for the present has also been renounced. Although there is no express stipulation in the Concession that the line is to be built continuously eastward, it was clearly understood at the time of the signature of the Convention that this condition would be observed, and the Germans admit that they do not believe that their influence with the Sultan is strong enough to induce His Imperial Majesty to consent to depart from it. The Germans have not made any step yet towards raising the construction loans. They recognize that it would be useless to do so in the present condition of the Turkish Treasury, 'but they hope that when the increase of the customs duties has become an accomplished fact, some arrangement may be feasible. They believe that the extra 3 per cent, will be considerably more productive than is generally calculated, and they hope, too, that the work of the Financial Commission in Macedonia will effect economies which will relieve the heavy drain on the Exchequer, so that in about the course of the next six or eight months they may see their way to getting security for the loans and the kilometric guarantee. M. Tester expressed his conviction that the German Government was ready to allow the section south of Bagdad to be built and worked by British capital on the same terms as those enjoyed by the Anatolian Railway Company.

[May 8.] Section 1, “&gt;15987] No. 1. Question asked in the House of Commons, May 8, 1906. Mr. Rees ,—To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether, since one reason for the late Government’s refusal in 1903 to co-operate officially in the construc tion of the so-called Bagdad Bail way was the desire of the Turkish Government to increase the customs duties from 8 per cent, to 11 per cent., and to pledge such increase as a guarantee of interest on the requisite capital, His Majesty’s Govern ment has consented to this increase of the Turkish duties; whether this increase is to be used as a kilometric guarantee, in whole or in part, towards the construc tion of the Bagdad Bailway as already constructed or projected; whether His Majesty’s Government is obtaining any substantial concession from the Turkish Government in return for consenting to this increase in the customs duties; and whether the Turkish or German Governments, or any financial group, has requested His Majesty’s Government to reconsider the refusal to co-operate in the construction of the Bagdad Bailway or to provide a terminus upon the Persian Gulf; and, if so, whether the results may, if no sufficient objection exists, be communicated to the House. Answer. His Majesty’s Government have not as yet consented to the proposed increase in the Turkish customs duties. As to the conditions on which they are prepared to do so, 1 would refer the honourable Member to the reply which I am giving to a question from the honourable Member for the Bipon Division of Yorkshire on this subjects The question of the Bagdad Bail way has not recently been brought before His Majesty’s Government officially from any quarter.

(No. 276. Confidential.) Sir, Constantinople, April 24, 1906. WITH reference to the paragraph, in my despatch No. 249, Confidential, of the 12th instant, in which I mentioned that the German group representing the Bagdad Railway had acquired a controlling interest in the Mersina-Adana Railway, I have the honour to transmit herewith a Memorandum of the circumstances of that operation. I may add that during his recent visit to Constantinople Dr. Zander requested Mr. Edwin Pears, the Chairman of the Company, and Sir William Whittall, to retain seats on the Board, and both these gentlemen have accepted the invitation. I understand that Dr. Zander thought it desirable to secure the legal knowledge of the former, who is the leader of the British Bar at Constantinople, to explain the legal technicalities with which the statutes of the English Company abound, while the experience and knowledge of the latter, as senior partner in an old-established exporting firm in Asia Minor, made him a desirable member of the Board, and possibly would predispose both these gentlemen to regard with favour any scheme making for the co-operation of British capitalists in the Bagdad Railway. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) N. R. O’CONOR. Inclosure in No. 1. Memorandum. (Confidential.) EARLY in December 1905 Baron de Vendeuvre, the Yice-Cbairman of the Mersina-Adana Railway Company, left Constantinople for Berlin, where, after several interviews with Dr. Zander and Herr Gwinner, acting on behalf of the Anatolian Railway Company and Deutsche Bank respectively, he came to an arrangement by which he undertook to place those Companies jointly in possession of a sufficient number of ordinary and preference shares of the Mersina Railway to command a majority of votes at general meetings of the Company. ^ The total vote-carrying share capital of the Mersina Company at that time was 401,000/. nominal, i.e., 8,250 ordinary shares of 20/. each, and 118,000 preference shares of 2/. each. Five ordinary or ten preference shares confer a vote on the holder, so that the total capital represents 2,807 votes, i.e., 1,650 and 1,157 belonging to holders of ordinary and preference shares respectively. A bare majority of votes being thus 1,404, and the German group being already able to command 506, shares representing 898 votes were required, and under the agreement Baron de Vendeuvre had to hand over the requisite number of shares before the 16th January, for which he was to lecehe 214,820/. He was further commissioned to purchase any number of preference shares at a maximum price of 15/. 10s. for one month after the above operation should have been completed. There is every reason to believe that the agreement thus concluded was the i esult of negotiations that had been on foot for some time. At all events, within a few days of his return to Constantinople early in January, M. de \ endeuvre was able to deliver the shares, and the transaction was forthwith completed. I could not ascertain the exact proportion of ordinary and preference shares acquired by the German gioup, but it is practically certain that the majority are preference shares, which as an investment are more profitable than the ordinary, and for the same capital outlay give a^ greater voting power. A large proportion of the shares requiied weie obtained by M. de Vendeuvre from another member of the Board, also a Frenchman, named Coiseau.2 Through-out the transaction, by which he is reported to have cleared as much as 30,000/., M. de Vendeuvre kept his colleagues on the Board in ignorance of what was going on, and they only learnt of it on his return to Constantinople, when the transfer of the shares was on the point of being made. The German Group now control about 1,440 to 1,450 votes out of a total of 2 807 (Initialled) C.

His Majesty s Consul-General expresses the opinion that the excavations are not being made merely for archaeological purposes, but for the collection of information and the dissemination of German influence in connection with the construction of the Bagdad Railway.

I HAVE the honour to reply to the Embassy despatch ol the 3rd February, 1906, regarding the new German Vice-Consulate at Mosul. 2. Prior to the receipt of this letter I have already given your Excellency all the information I have on the subject, and it only remains to observe that, in* my opinion, the excavations at Babylon and Kela Shergat, though mainly, are not merely excavations for archselogical research. It seems hardly necessary to have at Babylon three highly-trained surveyors, who appear to have a good deal of engineering knowledge as well. Moreover, the excavations advance so slowly that one is inclined to think there must be some reason for the leisurely progress that is being made and to wonder what is being awaited. The employes at Babylon are changed rather frequently, apparently as soon as they have mastered enough Arabic and acquired enough patience to control and direct Arab labourers. Such men will he very useful hereafter when the Bagdad Railway enters this part of the country, not only in managing, hut in collecting, numbers of Arab workmen. 3. I am not so familiar with the work and procedure at Kela Shergat as with that at Babylon, but from such knowledge as I have, I think similar remarks would apply to Kela Shergat also. 4. I think both these places are meant not only to serve the ends of archaeology, hut to act as centres for the collection of information and the dissemination of German influence. I cannot he certain that this is so, but your Excellency receives infor mation from so many sources that you may be in a position to confirm or modify the opinion I have indicated. I have &amp;c (Signed) ’ L. S. NEWMARCH. Inclosure 2 in No. 1. Consul-General Newmarch to Sir N. O'Conor. (No. 31.) Sir, Bagdad, March 10, 1906. IN reply to your Excellency’s despatch of the 3rd February, 1906, regarding the German excavations at Kela Shergat and Babylon, I have the honour to refer to my despatch No. 30 of this date, and to add the following remarks :— [1927 r—1]2 I know the German house at Babylon well. It is by no means unduly large for three persons, and visitors to Babylon are rather frequent nowadays. In my opinion, it is hardly large enough even for the purposes of the excavation. I have not seen the house at Kela Shergat, but I am making discreet inquiries about it. 3. As regards the German steam-launch at Bagdad, I have already reported to your Excellency about it before and after its arrival here (see my despatch of the 7th March, 1905). It has only been used a very little in the river just in front of Bagdad; it has made no long journey. It is from week to week in front of the German Consulate flying the German flag, and is illuminated on fete days. It has very little free-board and its speed hardly exceeds 4 knots. It is a poor thing, which would hardly be acceptable as a gift, and is only suited for very smooth water. It has not been w r recked, but it has twice essayed the role of a submarine-boat. The last time it went to the bottom of the river, it wms cleaned, repaired, and put together by Herr Koldewei, the head of the excavation party at Babylon, who seems to he rather an expert mechanical engineer. I have not heard of any larger boat coming in its place, but I think it is not improbable that an attempt will be made to replace it by a larger vessel. 4. The archaeological parties at Babylon and Kela Shergat are certainly well supplied with funds. I have been watching their proceedings with interest ever since I have been here, but there has been nothing definite about them which I have not already brought to notice. I have, &amp;c.

Sir, Constantinople, April 16, 1906. DURING the course of the prolonged negotiations connected with the amendments of the Mining Law, I was fully aware of the privileged position secured to the Germans by Article XXII of the Bagdad Railway Convention and of the effect which it would have on British mining enterprise in the vast regions traversed by the line. That Article states : “ Le concessionnaire aura la faculte d’exploiter les mines qu’il aura d^couvertes dans une zone de vingt kilom. de chaque c6te de 1’axe de la voie, en se conformant aux lois et Reglements y relatifs, et sans que cela constitue pour lui un privilege ou un monopole.” It is, indeed, probable that, if strictly interpreted, the saving clause providing against a monopoly by the Company would secure to a foreigner his rights and privileges derived from first discovery of a mine within the 40-kilom. belt; hut, on the other hand, there can be little doubt that in face of the special advantages possessed by the Railway Company, competition would be difficult, if not altogether fruitless, even under the conditions of the new Mining Law. It was with this situation in mind that I yesterday discussed the question, in all its bearings, with Mr. Edwin Whittall, the head of the firm of Whifctall and Company, with a view to discovering what steps, if any, could be taken to make good the rights of British subjects to permis de recherches in case of the discovery of mines which had not been applied for by the Railway Company or their associates. Mr. Whittall then revealed to me that he had been in communication -with a German Syndicate of which the Deutsche Bank is a predominant member, for the working of mines within the railway’s privileged zone. to the English and the remaining 55 per cent, to the Germans, while it was further provided that the agreement should affect not only the privileged area, but should be extended to mines discovered by either party in other parts of the country. Mr. Whittall said that a highly influential Syndicate, composed of some of the South African mine-owners, was already in course of formation in London, and that he had no doubt of obtaining all the financial support required for the development of such mines as they discovered. In his opinion, Asia Minor would, before very long, be the South Africa of the northern hemisphere as regards mining enterprise. He regarded the new Mining Law, which the Embassy had succeeded in obtaining, as a great stimulant to such undertakings. It is with extreme satisfaction that I report this arrangement, as it will, in all probability, open a fruitful field for the profitable employment of British capital, and will, moreover, remove a competition which, while injurious to the financial interests of both parties, could hardly fail, in the course of time, to produce serious friction, especially when mining developments extended to the southern districts of Anatolia and to the rich oil-fields near Kerbela. Mr. W’hittall requested me to regard the information he had given me as confidential, as the negotiations are not yet completed, and it is not desirable that the Ottoman Government should be aware of them. 7 CONFIDENTIAL.

Detailed information of the scheme is at present lacking ; hut as the negotiations have now reached a point where success appears to he certain and secrecy no longer necessary, I hope to he shortly m a position to report further on the matter. The Germans, as a rule, manage to work their designs very quietly and secretly and, as an instance, I may mention a project now being talked of for a railway from Konia to Erzeroum. As early as December last I received information from Dr. Jewett at Sivas, that a party of engineers under M. Daudix, of the Anatolian Railway Company’ had recently arrived and was engaged in surveying a route to Erzeroum, via Sivas and Erzmjian. I requested His Majesty’s Consul at Erzeroum to inquire as to the proceedings of the party, hut Mr. Shipley was no more able than Dr. Jewett to obtain any admission from the local authorities as to the object of the survey. A copy of Mr. Shipley’s despatch, which shows the route followed by M. Daudrix is inclosed herewith. Another railway project which has come to the fore again quite recently, is for a line from Sams-oon to Angora, or possibly even to Konia, but I am unable to’ say that any definite negotiations for a concession have been set on foot by Dr. Zander. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) N. R. O’CONOR. WITH reference to your Excellency’s despatch of the 10th January last, requesting information respecting the work and proceedings of a party of engineers consisting of M. Daudix, the engineer of the Anatolian Railway Company, his Secretary, M. Sagno, with five Turkish officers who have been engaged in the work of surveying a route from Erzeroum via Erzinjian to Sivas, I have the honour to transmit to your Excellency the following particulars which I have obtained from correspondents at Erzinjian and other places on the route. It should be stated that from Erzeroum to Erzinjian there are twu roads for ordinary traffic, viz., the first from Yeni Han, Ashkale Baibourt, and Kelkid Tchiftlik ; the second, which is shorter, branching off at Yeni Han (about four hours from Erzeroum), and, after passing through the village of Mama Khatoun, crosses the Euphrates at Kotur Keupri, whence, after skirting the Sipikor or Djebidje range, it proceeds through the plain of Balaban to Erzinjian. M. Daudix and his party, however, according to my informant, adopted neither the Baibourt nor the Mama Khatoun route, but, after proceeding from Erzeroum to Askhale by the ordinary road, kept, on leaving the latter place, to the banks of the Euphrates all the way to Erzinjian, passing through the above-mentioned Kotur Keupri, the villages of Karghin, Vidjan, Halil Agha Han, and the Balaban plain. From Erzinjian onwards Inclosure 1 in No. 1. (No. 5.) Sir, Consul Shipley to Sir N. 0’Conor. Erzeroum, March 7, 1906. [1927 Z' —2] eiaXcb IT}to Kemakh (a distance of some twelve hours), a survey was made of the road on both, sides of the Euphrates, including an examination of places suitable for the construction of fh^e bridges. About one hour before reaching Kemakh there is the junction of a stream called Keumur Tchai with the Euphrates, and from this spot, if the information supplied to me be exact, the engineers made two surveys of a line to Sivas, one in a northerly direction by Gerdjanis, Sou Shehr, and Enderis, near Shebhan Kara Hissar in the Sivas Vilayet; the second, westwards through Zimara to Divrighi. The above details are, I fear, of a somewhat scanty nature, and the delay i],\ warding my report to your Excellency is due to the fact that, such as they are. M :cellency they are, I have been entirely dependent for them on correspondents in outlying districts, no •rocurable at Erzeroum. Nazim Pasha, the Governor-General in information being pru^^a-^xc cm .^xz,cx^ix±m. x ccoxxct, cxxc, vx^voxmui-vjreuerai, m reply to a question which I put to him on the matter, stated that no report from M. Daudix had reached him as to the results of the latter’s proceedings, his own instructions having merely been to furnish all the needful facilities. As regards the question of the eventual possibility of the line being constructed or, if made, of its giving a reasonable return on the outlay expended, I have not sufficient material at my disposal to form an opinion. In view, however, of the great distance which such a line would have to traverse, it is considered by some that the Iditional facilities thereby afforded for the export of Erzeroum grain would, to a great extent, be neutralized by the heavy freight which would necessarily have to be paid. On the other hand, the advantages from a military point of view of connecting Erzeroum with the already existing Anatolian Railway system are obvious, and it is felt that if the line is constructed at all it will be from considerations of the above nature. A less ambitious project which, I understand from Nazim Pasha, has already been sanctioned, is the construction of a carriageable road from Erzeroum through Izpir to Rizeh and the Black Sea. This would not have the military advantages alluded to above, but as its length, compared with the road already existing from Erzeroum to Trebizond, would be about one-half, the increased facilities which would thereby be afforded to the trade of Erzeroum with the exterior and to the transit trade with Persia are obvious. 1 inclose, herewith, the itinerary followed by M.

Sir, ■ D ,'V ZA ^ DER &gt; the President of the Anatolian and Bagdad' ltailivav Co’rmanTes, arrived here about a week ago, and was good enough to call on me to-day. In the course of our conversation, which it was understood on both sides was entirely private and unofficial, Dr. Zander said that he understood that what Great Britain wanted was the construction and working of the eastern end of the railway from Bagdad south; that he had personally no objection to this arrangement, but that he could only speak in his own name, and without in anyway engaging his own Government, of whose views on the subject he was, indeed, ignorant. If, however, such an arrange ment were to be realized, there was one element in the situation which would require very careful handling, viz., the necessity of doing nothing to excite the mistrust of the Sultan, or lead him to believe that the German Syndicate was ceding to England an important part of the concession which they had obtained for themselves. It was not unknown to me how suspicious His Majesty was of British action and influence in those legions, and how r essential it consequently became not to arouse his susceptibilities or fears.^ He (Dr. Zander) believed himself that we could come to an understanding which would give us the full control of the construction and exploitation of the line, once we could devise a formula which, while leaving the Germans ostensibly in the enjoyment of the concession, would give England all the rights, privileges, and guarantees which she required. The Bagdad Railway Company could wait a short time to see if it were possible to come to an understanding with England and France, but they could not stand still indefinitely, and must at no distant date go on with the construction of the line. He was thus naturally anxious to know if I could give him any indication as to the views and intentions of the present Government in regard to the general question of participation with the Germans and French. I said that His Majesty’s Government had scarcely been long enough in office to have had time to consider this question, but that no doubt it would come within their purview at no distant date, though I could not say definitely in what way or at what time. I was sure His Majesty’s Government would approach the question with the most open mind, and with a strong desire to come to terms with Germany if they could possibly do so on terms consistent with the commercial and other interests of the country. The question had not, however, been touched upon for some months, and the last reference I had seen to it was in the shape of a private conversation between Mr. Gwinner and Sir Edward Law. Dr. Zander concluded by saying that he hoped both Great Britain and France would join in the undertaking, but that if they did not come to some decision within a reasonable time, it would be impossible for Germany to hold open the door indefinitely. I can take no exception to Dr. Zander’s opening remarks respecting the distrust unfortunately entertained by the Sultan of England’s intentions in the neighbourhood of Bagdad and the Persian Gulf, nor do I think that he referred to the point to protect the special interests of Germany, but mentioned it simply as a factor that demands consideration. ^ I have already, and notably in my despatch No. 217 of the 28th April, 1903, so fully explained my views and opinions of the advantages, under conditions which would have to be carefully studied, of British participation in this great railway enterprize that I need not trouble you with any remarks on the general question which would be mainly a repetition of those which I have already made. 1 venture to say once more, however, [1927 1] A ] [April 23.j Section 1, No. L Sir N. 0 Conor to Sir Edward Grey.—[Received April 23.) Confidential.) Constnntinnnl.fi. Anvil 19 1 QOflmmmmmmmmmmmrnsv y 2 that I believe the railway will probably be constructed with or without the participation of the Anglo-French groups, although obviously in the latter case in circumstances of greater difficulty. I further believe that the sand is running out, and if we decide that it is in our interest to join in the construction of the railway together with the French— without whose participation I should be reluctant to do so—I hardly think we can expect a more propitious moment for opening negotiations. It is improbable that the Germans if they surmount the difficulties, financial and other, attending the construction of the line through the Taurus range, and once reach the open plain beyond it, will be willing to offer us acceptable terms. These difficulties now loom very large, in view of the con-' dition of Ottoman finance and the concentration in the Paris Bourse of Turkish Stock* but a perusal of the careful Memorandum prepared by Mr. Mark Sykes (inclosed in my despatch No. 187 of the 20th March) will show that they may be overcome by judicious financial manipulation and by the personal influence which the German Emperor is sure to bring to bear on the Sultan. I believe Dr. Zander to be actuated by a sincere desire to see both England and France participate in the scheme as the only means of relieving the Syndicate from a position of immediate difficulty and embarrassment, while at the same time it would offer sterling advantages to the Germans from various points of view. He no doubt realizes the political and material advantages of our good will from Bagdad down to Koweit, and is fully aware of the obstruction which may be felt should the terminal station be within the territory of the Sheikh Moubarak, with whom, he well knows, we have special agreements; nor does he lose sight of the material benefit to the railway should His Majesty’s Government decide to send the British Indian mails by this route. He knows and recognizes the importance of our interests and influence in the region of the Persian Gulf, and prefers an amicable compromise to a struggle which miMit be fruitful of danger to both parties. He also realizes the importance of the good-will of the French Government, with out whose support he cannot expect to obtain a quotation of any Ottoman bonds that may be issued in payment of the construction of the railway, and he is well aware that, without the co-operation of the Two Powers, Ins labours to obtain security from the Ottoman Government for a kilometric guarantee will be immensely increased. 1 he advantages to Great Britain of a concession giving her the right of construct ing and working the railway from Bagdad to Koweit are distinct and palpable, but it is not so clear where French interests come in under the arrangement proposed by Dr. Zander. Evidently some compensating advantages must be found for Fiance, and the question is not one of easy solution. In view, however, of the fact that the extension northwards of the existing French railway system is rapidly being pushed forward, and may even be completed by the end of this summer as far as Aleppo, where a junction with a branch of the Bagdad Railway is eventually to be created, it is possible that the French would be willing to take over the construction of the line from that point to Diarbekir, Mosoul, or Tekrit, which last- named place would be a favourable point for us to start from. This, however, is only an idea which has crossed my mind ; but I noticed that it did not appear to meet with disfavour from the French Ambassador, to whom I mentioned it casually as a possible airangement. I he idea was new to him, and his remarks cannot therefore be taken as representing the views which either he himself or his Government might hold when the point came to be studied in all its bearings. Both M. Constans and I were, however, of opinion that the moment had come when the whole question of co-operation with the Germans must be seriously examined, and in the event of a decision being taken adverse to participation, I venture to think that it behoves us to consider what our policy should be towards the Bagdad Railway as a purely German enterprise. 1 have reason to believe that recently M. Auboyneau, one of the Directors of the Imperial Ottoman Bank, gave the German group to understand that if the Algeciras Conference came to a satisfactory issue, the bank would be ready to confer again about the Bagdad Railway. I learn, however, from M. Constans, that up to the present moment no overtures have been made from Berlin, but I venture to submit that in the event of an exchange of views taking place between the French and German groups, we should bo prepared to define our attitude on the general question and to indicate in broad lines the conditions of our co-operation. 1 heie can be no doubt that the Russian Government will regard with disfavour a combination by which Great Britain and France will participate in an enterprise which they have always viewed with suspicion, and which, were they in a position to do so, (hey would oppose with all their former vigour and hostility. So far as I know, however,the hieneh Government is not disposed to pay much attention to Russian susceptibilities in regard to this matter. In this leview of the situation it ought, perhaps, to be mentioned that no steps have been taken foi the construction ot the railway beyond Eregli. The Germans appear to shi ink from facing alone the enormous cost of the next section across the Taurus range, ana if they are unable to obtain assistance they may find themselves forced to seek another combination involving less expenditure by avoiding the mountains. Such a ^ combination may be found by the construction of a line from Eregli, or more likely from some point west of Eregli, direct to Mersina, whence by utilizing the existing Mersina—Adana Railway, in which they have recently obtained a controlling interest, the line can be continued eastwards on the route originally planned.

IN my despatch No 563 of the 16th August last I reported that the’German Syndicate, formed under the auspices of the Deutsche Bank to obtain a Concession for the working of the petroleum fields in Mesopotamia, was on the point of renewing the 1 revisional Agreement with the Civil List for another year, and that the Agreement con ferred on it the same advantages and privileges as a “permis de recherches.” I have since learnt, however, that what the Germans really obtained was an option for the Concession on equal terms with those offered by any other group that might come Quite recently, the Palace being in want of an advance of £ T. 50,000, the Civil List was instructed to invite the German Syndicate to take up the option at the price of the above sum, but the Germans, convinced that their position was absolutelv secure, and that they could affoid to defer taking any action until their railway schemes were further advanced, and having also, so I am informed, some difficulty in finding the money, were unwilling to give more than £ T. 25,000, and the proposal of the Civil List was formally rejected by M. Huguenin on behalf of the Syndicate. The Germans having thus declined to exercise their preference rights, the Civil List was instructed by Imperial Trade to offer the Concession on similar terms to any other group of repute, and commenced negotiations with Messrs. Gilchrist and Walker, an English firm of this city, who have been carefully watching the question in the interests of Mr. D’Arcy and bis friends, who hastened to take advantage of the opportunity thus offered. They have accordingly been treating with the Civil List for the transfer of the optiomM'or a period of three months to a M. Eichstoiff, a Dutch lawyer, acting in their name, and the negotiations have reached a point which appears to promise immediate success. The matter stands as follows : The Civil List state that, to enable them to submit the proposed transfer of the option to M. Eichstorff for the Imperial sanction, they must, be furnished with a written declaration from a bank of standing that that gentleman is in a position to pay the £ T. 50,000 on the signature of the contract of concession, and as, in order to prevent the negotiations coming to the knowledge of the Germans, they have requested that the matter may not be mentioned to the Imperial Ottoman Bank or Credit Lyonnais, Messrs. Gilchrist and Walker have, with the approval of the Civil List, applied to the Banque Rationale of Athens. Messrs. Gilchrist and Walker have no doubt as to the readiness of this bank to give the required declaration, but they have not been able to obtain it owing to the absence from Constantinople of M. Calocaressi, the local Director. They expect him to return in a day or two, and are confident that they will then immediately secure the option for the Concession. The Concession is to cover not only Mesopotamia but the whole of the Vilayets of Bagdad and Mosul, and the £ T. 50,000 is not to be paid over until after the signature of the contract of concession between the Civil List and a Company to be formed within three months, for which the option holds ; it is, moreover, to be regarded as a loan to be paid back gradually out of the royalties on the raw oil extracted. Messrs. Gilchrist and Walker have secured powerfxd support at the Palace, and they are convinced that when once they are in possession of the option, the eventual Concession is assured to them. I need not dwell on the advantages which must result to us from the acquisition by a British capitalist of a Concession covering the two provinces of Mosul and Bagdad, nor on the commanding position we should acquire thereby in relation to the questions connected with the Bagdad Railway. I venture, however, to suggest that Mr. D’Arcy might be informed confidentially of the situation as it now stands, in case there should he any difficulty or delay in Messrs. Gilchrist and Walker obtaining the declaration required by the Civil List. Mr. D’Arcy is already, I believe, aware that negotiations [1901 cc—2] BAGDAD RAILWAY.

Confidential.) gtr 5 St. Petersburgh, March 28, 1906. I BEG to thank yon for the communication of the Memorandum of the Director of Military Operations, dated the 22nd February, relative to the new Russian road from Kazvin to Hamadan. I venture to submit the following observations :— Some years ago the Germans possessed a Concession for the construction of a road from Khanikin to Kermanshah, which lapsed owing mainly to the determined opposi tion of the Russian Legation, which, I believe, threatened the Shah’s Government with the most serious consequences if the road were constructed and worked by the Germans. Should the Anatolian line be continued to Bagdad, and a branch line constructed to the Persian frontier at Khanikin, and the former German Concession for the Kermanshah line be revived, the Germans would control the pilgrim route to Kerbelah, which is the only line in Persia which is certain to pay. The traffic on it would be considerable and constant. The newly-appointed German Minister to Persia, who, as I hear, will be provided with strong letters of recommendation from the Sultan to the Shah, has been connected for some time with the Deutsche Bank and the Bagdad Railway, on which subject he is considered a specialist. It is not unreasonable to suppose that his mission may be not unconnected with a project for linking up the Bagdad Railway with Persia by means of a road via Khanikin. Such a scheme will nearly affect Russian interests in Persia. It will also have a wider significance, for the Russian railway system now extends to Julfa, on the Araxes, and a road is constructed to Tabreez which can be readily converted into a railway. From Tabreez to Hamadan via Kazvin, as is pointed out in the Memorandum of the 22nd February, the construction of a railway may be said to be in preparation. The line to Tabreez should be a paying undertaking, as the province tapped is one of considerable fertility. The continuation to Hamadan would not apparently be profitable. But from Hamadan to Bagdad (should a line be con structed) the pilgrim traffic insures the profitable nature of the undertaking. Compared with the German route to Bagdad (unless the projected irrigation works are completed, which would be the work of years), the Russian route via Persia would seem, from the commercial point of view, a more promising undertaking, and one which should prove more attractive to capitalists. Thus, in the race to Bagdad, Russian enterprise might have a reasonable chance of winning, if supported by the necessary capital. Tire obstacles are mainly political i.e., the objections of England in Persia and of Germany in Turkey. Should these objections be overcome, Russia would command a direct route to the south via Persia and Bagdad. If, at the same time, England were intrusted with the construction of a line from Koweit to Bagdad, the interests of Germany, England, and Russia would all have due consideration. If there were objections to the division of the line into spheres of interests, the whole railway system, with its ramifications, could be internationalized, and worked m the common interests of the world. The French Ambassador informs me that some such plan would be viewed not unfavourably m Paris, where it is believed that unless England and Iiance paiticipate m the construction of the Bagdad Railway it will eventually be constiucted by Germany alone. Russia, how r ever, has objected, and without the consent of Russia the participation of France and England would be merely playing into Germany s hands, and quite needlessly alienating Russia for the benefit of Germany. But if Russia could be induced to withdraw her opposition, France would gladly enter into the German scheme. I have since understood, though not with positive certainty, that Count Witte is not averse to the construction of the Bagdad Railway on the under standing that Russia receives the right of joining up her own system with the projected line. I venture to point out that if a line were constructed from the Gulf to Bagdad, [1923 6—4]2 England would also receive certain commercial facilities which would be of great value. It might thus be possible to reconcile the conflicting interests by a general scheme which would do justice to the claims of all parties concerned. But it i s evident that if Germany obtains the concession to Kermanshah and Hamadan the combination above outlined becomes impossible, and that it might, therefore, be as well that the Governments of England and Russia should interchange views as to the course to be taken in view of such an eventuality. *.. In conversation with M. Hartwig, I have touched lightly on these considerations ^ He has expressed himself strongly on the subject of a possible German Railway Concession in Persia, and told me that he did not believe that his Government could be brought to consent to it.

O'Conor to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received March 26.) (No. 187.) Sir, Constantinople, March 20, 1906. I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith copy of a Memorandum by Mr. Mark Sykes, Honorary Attache to His Majesty’s Embassy, on certain aspects of the Bagdad Bailway. It is an interesting study on the chances of the appropriation of the surplus revenues of the Public Debt or other State resources of the Ottoman Empire to a 1 dome trie guarantee of the railway in question. The information, as embodied in this Memorandum, has been obtained from reliable sources, and is accurate up to the date of its completion. The competition between the Ottoman Bank, which is supported by the pressing needs of the Imperial Treasury and the Bagdad Bailway Company, diminishes the probability of this surplus being obtained by the latter. In fact, I understand that the surplus of 1906 is already partly hypothecated to the bank, and that the latter are in negotiation for further loans, to be secured on the surplus of 1907-1908. IT is now nearly two years since the first section of the Bagdad Bailway was completed, and rumours have long been abroad to the effect that the immediately ensuing sections will presently be undertaken. The following figures may assist in forming a judgment as to whether this is possible or no without British co-operation:— Before going further, it would be as well to inquire into the working of the system of kibmietric guarantees on State-supported lines in the Ottoman Empire. The scheme is briefly as follows: A Company undertakes to construct a line of a certain length, and the Ottoman Government guarantees that the Company’s annual receipts shall reach a certain specified sum per kilometre— that is to say, if a Company build a line 20 kilom. in length and the Government guarantees 1,000 fr. per kilometre, and in a given year the Company’s actual receipts amount to 500 fr. per kilometre or 10,000 fr. on the whole line, the Government is obliged to provide 10,000 fr. to make up the deficiency between the sum guaranteed and the Company’s receipts. To the payment of the guarantee the Government ear-marks certain revenues for the purpose, which are then collected by the Administration of the Public Debt; but it is as well to make it clear that these ear-marked revenues are never equal in value to the whole guarantee, as the fact that the railway will have at least some receipts is naturally taken for granted, though, speaking generally, the ear-marked revenues usually exceed the anticipated deficit in the Company’s receipts by a consider able sum. Whatever be the difference between the deficit in receipts and the yield of the ear-marked revenues is handed over to the Ottoman Government; such money is termed a surplus, and will be referred to as such in this Memorandum. The surpluses on the various railways are liable to fluctuations from two causes :— 1. Amount of receipts on the railways. 2. Amount yielded by the ear-marked revenues. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) N. B. O’CONOB. Inclosure in No. 1. Memorandum by Mr. Sykes respecting the Bagdad Railway.o The amounts of the kilometric guarantees naturally vary on the different lines, as do the proportionate values of the ear-marked revenues assigned to make them good. This has led, on occasions, to considerable surpluses on some lines and actual deficits in guarantees on others. However, as the total surpluses completely outbalance the total deficits, the whole of the guaranteed railways in the Ottoman Empire came to an understanding by which it was agreed that any deficit on any one line should be made good out of the total surplus of the remainder; this agreement has the tacit consent of the Government, and the present arrangement is that the Debt pools the whole of the ear-marked revenues and pays each Company the sum required to make up the deficit between its receipts and its guarantee. The average total surplus of the various ear-marked revenues over the total deficits on the railways of Turkey, including the surplus on the Osmanieh and Fisheries Loans, stands at £ T. 229,737 tor 1900, 1901, 1902, 1903, 1901. This surplus, in spite of occasional bad years, is increasing, partly owing to the general increase of receipts by itailway Companies and partly owing to the increase of the value of the ear-marked revenues. In the year 1901 the surplus was £ T. 340,000, and in 1905 £ T. 316,000. It now remains to consider the financial arrangements laid down by the Bagdad Convention for the construction of the sections of the Bagdad Itailway. It was agreed that for each section a loan should be made on securities given by the Ottoman Government, that this capital should defray the cost of construction of the section, and that when the section was in working order the Turkish Government would give a kilometric guarantee to cover working expenses. By section 35 of the Bagdad Bail way Convention it was agreed that the working expenses kilometric guarantee on the first (or Konia-Eregli) section should he met by the surplus on the Anatolian Railways. As this surplus is about £ T. 49,000, and the sum required to make up the guarantee is about £ T. 26,000, there is still a balance of £ T. 23,000 to pool in the general railway surplus of the Empire. The German financiers undoubtedly wish to construct the ensuing sections of the Bagdad Railway, but the next section to be completed presents the greatest difficulties from a financial point of view, owing to the magnitude of the engineering works necessary for the passage of the Taurus Mountains. It is laid down in the Bagdad Railway Convention that a loan not exceeding 54,090,000 fr. may be raised to defray the cost of construction of any one section. The next section it is estimated will cost about £ T. 4,000,000. A nominal loan of 54,000,000 fr. issued at the same price as that for the first section will only realize £ T. 2,052,364, or little more than half the sum required. The Germans propose, there fore, to build three sections at once of 200 kilom. each, and as it is estimated the following two sections will only cost £ T. 700,000 apiece, the total cost of the three sections would be £ T. 5,400,000, and the loan to meet the expenditure would produce £ T. 6,150,000, leaving a considerable margin of safety to meet unforeseen difficulties. The service of this loan would require the assignment of revenues to the extent of £ T. 320,760 per annum. If we take the basis of the Konia-Eregli section the annual sum required to be ear-marked to meet the working expenses-kilometric guarantee would be £ T. 76,000 per annum. The question is therefore whether the Ottoman Government has the revenues at its disposal to produce £ T. 396,760 per annum to meet interest on the loan for construction, and to make up the working expenses-kilometric guarantee on three sections. The Debt has at present a surplus from tithes of roughly £ T. 300,000, and from the ceded revenues an approximate surplus of £ T. 300,000 more, making in all a surplus of about £ T. 600,000. A short time ago a contract was signed for a loan on the surplus of the ceded revenues, amounting to 2,500,000/., but owing to some hitch in the negotiations the Ottoman Bank only advanced 1,100,000/. The interest on this advance amounts to a charge of £ T. 56,917 on the surplus revenues of the Debt, leaving a net surplus on the ceded revenues of about £ T. 210,000 and £ T. 300,000 surplus on the tithes, making in ail a total of £ T. 540,000. For the present year the whole of this surplus has been allocated by the Imperial Ottoman Government for various purposes in their current Budget, but as this is only an act of annual expenditure it in no way makes this surplus unavailable for the purpose of securing a future loan. The Germans have in hand the sum of at least £ T. 400,000, which was cleared over the construction of the Konia-Eregli section of the Bagdad Railway. This money is at the disposal of those financiers and politicians to whose interest it is tosee that the Bagdad Bailway is built, and competent judges are of opinion that this sum is sufficiently large to enable them to persuade those in power to assign the remaining surplus of the Public Debt for the purpose of paying for the service of the construction loan, and securing the working expenses-kilometric guarantee of the next three sections. It may be held that this surplus is liable to fluctuations, and is therefore not good as a security, but a glance at the figures of the Public Debt will show that its only tendency is* to increase, for, in spite of political troubles, bad harvests, and inefficient Government, there is a steady rise in the receipts of the railways, which brings with it a corresponding decrease in the sums required to make good the kilometric guarantees, while the tithes assigned to cover the guarantees in question continue to increase in yield and value. Besides these causes of increase in the surplus there is another, in that the annual revenue derived from salt, spirits, stamps, fisheries, and silks has nearly doubled itself in twenty-three years, not by sharp rises, but by a steady and general rise in every item of the revenue. These facts tend to show that the increasing surplus of £ T. 510,000 is a reliable security for the £ T. 396,760 required, for it must be remembered that the £ T. 76,000 hypothecated for the working'expenses-kilometric guarantee of the three sections represents a gradually decreasing sum. The Konia-Eregli section, which we took as a basis of calculation,' is at present an extremely unfavourable figure. When it is linked to the sea the traffic receipts of the section must almost certainly be doubled, and not only will money be thus released to pay for the working expenses of the two following sections, but they in their turn will begin to contribute considerable receipts to their own support; though, indeed, it would be rash to make any prophecy as to the fourth section, which for the first two years may have but little to do. Before going further it would be well to consider another argument that has been used to deprecate the value of the revenues hypothecated by the Ottoman Government as security for loans and guarantees, and is based on the fact that the Turkish Govern ment is suspected as being on the verge ol internal bankruptcy. It is said, and vith justice, that current expenses can only be met by loans, and that various shifts have to be resorted to to meet the daily wants of the public service. This no doubt is as true to-day as it was yesterday. 1 he difficulties ol the Turkish Government are perhaps increasing, but it must be borne m mind that a deficit in the salaries of the officials, a lack of money for military or public works, or a considerable financial cavity at head-quarters does not bring about a corresponding depression in the revenues assigned to the Debt, which depend for their yield, not on the Ottoman Administration, which is, perhaps, no better m times of prosperity than in the day of distress, but on the industry of the peasants, the richness of the soil, and the method of collection, three factors which are not influenced by the financial straits of the bureaucracy; in fact, the Government’s difficulties arise from an increasing expenditure, and not from a decrease in the potential wealth ol the country. Once a revenue comes into the hands of the Public Debt, for the purpose of securing a loan or making up a guarantee, there is no doubt as to its disposal, only the sui plus being within reach of the Government. However, that there are certain risks attending the investment of capital in Turkish loans cannot be denied, but it may be that ihey are not as formidable as they appear. The first danger is a war with Bulgaiia, which, so long as it lasted, might swallow up all the hypothecated revenues; but on the othei hand it is hardly possible that such a war could last above six months without coming to a decisive issue one way or another, and the Debt has guarded against such a con tingency by the establishment of a sinking fund, which at present would cover a Ml year’s deficit. The second danger which bondholders have to lace is a geneia i c financial crash resulting from an absolute lack of ready money at the Treasury with St silence the clamours of the unpaid officials both possible that at such a permit revenues assigned to the Debt, but m sucn a . - f a ii ow o.-.y ■such an event to take place, their combined interests 'T 00 ^. Yi^itfon appropriation of what has become the property of then subjects, and the ^position of a general financial control would became a matter of necessity, and such a co t ^l would certainly guarantee the interests ot the bondholdeis. It will be readily i K stood, therefore, why it is that German financiers are P r ^/°Aual dan-ef if need be, considering that circuimten^ ms^ of the There is, however one point to he collide ' g. it alld t'hat is that there Germans being given the net surplus of the Deb _ , u • j us from the Ottoman are other financiers in the field avIio desne to oI)ta c ]4 Government. It has been shown that the gross surplus of the Debt has already been tendered by the French Syndicate to secure a loan of 1,100,000/., which has been described as a portion of the loan of 5,500,000/. never wholly advanced. It is now stated that the French Syndicate is at this moment contemplating the increase of this loan to 3,500,000/., the service and interest on which would reduce the oross surnlus of the Debt to a net surplus of a little under £ T. 400,000. Should the Ottoman Government obtain this loan, it is obvious that the surplus of the Debt would be too crippled to bear the proposed loan of the Bagdad Railway group. The Germans might raise a portion (say two-thirds, or in interest and service about £ T. 213,333 per annum) on the net surplus of the Debt, but they would certainly be obliged to turn their attention elsewhere to cover the remainder of their loan and to assure the working expenses guarantee. The Ottoman Government has still at its disposal £ T. 3,100,000 per annum of unpledged tithes, and a balance of £ T. 1,813,800 of unpledged sheep tax. German influence and German money may quite possibly be able to secure nn annuity of £ T. 182,666 from these sources, for the persons who will assign them are not influenced for the moment by patriotic motives, and even if they were, it is an open question whether the State would not recoup itself to a considerable extent by the creation of fresh revenues and the increase of old ones in the hitherto isolated districts which will be traversed by the next three sections of the railway. there is one other point on which it may be well to touch before closing- this Memorandum, and that is, the alternative scheme of which the Germans may 5 avail themselves supposing the financial and engineering difficulties of the Taurus prove too -T? ^H ^P^ment^to their plans. By the Bagdad Railway Convention it is ‘f that the Bagdad-Bussorah section shall not be exploited until the whole of the trunk line is completed. This clause does not preclude the building and working of other sections, and now that the Germans have control of the MeJsina- dana line there is nothing to prevent them from building and exploiting the whole ?L, th r ''p® fetween Adana and Bagdad, in which case Adana could he linked uith Brega when sufficient money had been laid aside from loans and profits on construction of the Bagdad-Adana sections to overcome the difficulties of the mountain range.

General Railway development in Asia Minor. 2 . The Bagdad Railway Convention of 1903. 3. The Anglo-German negotiations of 1903. 4. The prospects of completion of the line without British co-operation. 5. The influence of the railway on British interests. In the first and second parts recourse has been had, both for purposes of reference and quotation, to two works in particular—“ Le Chemin de Per de Bagdad,” by Cheradame, and The Middle Eastern Question,” by Chirol. The statements of these writers have, however, been verified by official Reports, and where inaccurate care fully corrected. Part 3 is a summary of official correspondence. Part 4 is based upon (a) the Report for 1904- 1905 of the Ottoman Debt Administration, and (b) statistics respecting the yield, actual and estimated, of revenues available for allocation to the kilometric guarantees. Part 5 is a precis of Memoranda prepared at the Committee of Imperial Defence, the War Office, and the Board of Trade, and of official correspondence. Three Appendices are annexed, containing respectively a railway map of Asiatic Turkey, the text of the Bagdad Railway Convention of 1903, and a list of official documents and published works to which reference has been made. CONFIDENTIAL. (865S.)2 Part I. General Railway Development in Asia Minor up to 1903. The Anatolian Railway Company. (Scutari to Konia, 1,020 kilom., or 638 miles, including Angora line.) The first section of this line, from Scutari to Ismidt (91 kilom.), was originally built to the order of the Turkish Governmeot, under the direction of a German engineer. Yon Plessel. It was completed in 1873. The Ottoman autho rities soon found it difficult to work, and in 1880 granted it as a Concession to an English Com pany for twenty years. They had, however, reserved the right to determine the Concession at any date, and they exercised it in October 1888 in favour of M. Kaulla, a German. At the same time this gentleman received a Concession for ninety-nine years for a line from Ismidt to Angora, a distance of 485 kilom., with a kilometric guarantee of 15,000 fr., while the guarantee for the section from Scutari to Ismidt was fixed at 10,300 fr. per kilometre. M. Kaulla was acting on behalf of the Deutsche Bank and the Wurtembergische Vereinsbank. On the 16th March, 1889, these two institutions founded the Ottoman Company of Anatolian Railways. Practically the whole capital of the new Company was subscribed in Germany. The line to Angora began to work in 1893. In Pebruary of the same year two further Concessions were granted to the Anatolian Com pany :— 1 . Por an extension of the line from Eski- chehir (a point about midway between Ismidt and Angora) to Konia, a distance of 444 kilom., with a guarantee of nearly 14,000 fr. per kilom.; and 2. Por a line from Angora to Kaiserieh, with an eventual extension to Bagdad via Sivas and Diabekir. The Company found, in the light of further investigation, that the line from Angora toKaiserieh would not prove remunerative, and it was consequently abandoned. The section to Konia was opened to traffic in 1896. The total mileage of the Anatolian Company at this time was 610, made up as follows :— Scutari to Ismidt • • Kilom. .. 91 Israidt to Angora • • .. 485 Eskichehir to Konia • • • • 444 Total • • .. 1,020 The Managing Direetor of the railway was at first M. von Kuhlman, who was afterwards succeeded by M. Zander. The Chief Engineer was M. von Kapp. Before enumerating the further stages of the Turco-German negotiations in regard to railway development, it will be convenient to describe briefly other lines in Asiatic Turkey which are only partially under German influence, or entirely independent. The Smyrna-Cassaba Railway Company. (Total length, with extension to Afioun-Kara- hissar, 512 kilom., or 320 miles.) The Smyrna-Cassaba Bailway Concession was granted in 1863 to Mr. E. Price, who transferred his rights to a British Company. In 1872 an extension of 75 kilom., from Cassaba to Ala- chehir, was sanctioned. In 1893 the Ottoman Government exercised the right of repurchase, and transferred the line to M. Georges Nagelmackers (Director of the International Sleeping Car Company), granting him at the same time an extension to Afioun- Karahissar. In the following year, M. Nagelmackers formed the Societe Nouvelle des Chemins de Per Smyrne-Cassaba et Prolongement, with its head- quarters at Paris. The Company was thus placed more or less under Erench influence. Afioun-Karahissar was, however, already served by the Anatolian Bailway, and it was obvious that if a junction were effected much of the4 traffic destined for shipment to Europe would he diverted from Constantinople (4S3 kilom.) to the more convenient pore of Smyrna (420 kilom.). The German Company fully realized the danger, and the two lines remained separated by a few yards. Negotiations were at length begun between the two Companies, and resulted in an arrangement by which two Erench representatives were admitted to the Board of the Anatolian Bail- way and two Germans to that of the Smyrna- Cassaha Company. The Deutsche Bank had meanwhile purchased shares in the latter Com pany, and now possesses a majority of the total issue, and consequently a casting vote. When this arrangement was concluded (in 1899) the Porte at once removed its veto on the junction of the two lines at Afioun-Karahissar, and it was effected in 1901. Dr. Bohrbach, in his'hook “ Die Bagdadbahn,” published in Berlin in 1902, expresses the view that the line to Smyrna should in reality be looked upon as the first section of the Bagdad Bailway. The Smyrna-Aidin Railway Company. (Total length 516 kilom., or 322 miles.) The oldest Bailway Concession in Asia-Minor is that which was granted to the Smyrna-Aidin Company in September 1856. The railway now consists of a main line from Smyrna to Dineir, via Aidin, 376 kilom. (235 miles) in length, and of seven branch lines, 140 kilom. (87 miles) in length. In 1891 the Company applied for a Concession to prolong the line from Dineir to Konia. They were unsuccessful on this, as on a subsequent occasion (in 1901). The refusal of the Porte was, in the circum stances, most natural. The Aidin line possessed no kilometric guarantee. On the other hand, the Cassaba extension, from Alachehir to Afioun- Karahissar, had a guarantee of 18,900 fr. per kilometre. It was in the interest of the Turkish Government to diminish this guarantee by in creasing the traffic as rapidly as possible.[399] C aaise B— 5 The Mersina-Tarsus and Adana Railway Company (Limited). (Total length 67 kilom., or 4i2 miles.) Sir X. O’Conor, Xo. 208, April 22, 1903. This Company is under the management of an Anglo-Trench Board, which sits at Constan tinople. The President is Mr. E. Pears. The Concession includes mining, quarrying, and forestry rights, as well as immunity from taxation, and is for fifty years from January 1883. The railway then reverts, subject to pay ment for rolling-stock, &amp;c., to the Ottoman Government, who may, however, by arrangement with the Company, determine the duration of the Concession at any date after 1912. Much official correspondence, terminating with Mr. de Bunsen’s despatch No. 146, Commercial, of the 9th October, took place during 1900 on the subject of the fears entertained by the Mersina- Adana Company that the extension of the Bagdad Railway into their country, with access to a port on the Gulf of Alexandretta, would seriously injure their interests. The Anglo-German negotiations of 1903 revived their apprehensions, and in April of that year His Majesty’s Ambassador reported his belief that the Mersina Company had, through the intervention of the French Government, obtained a promise from the French group interested in the Bagdad Railway to purchase their line when that railway had been extended to Adana, a promise which had apparently been confirmed by the German group. Presumably this promise would not he held to he binding after the breakdown of the negotiations of 1903. Sir N. O’Conor informed the representatives of the British bondholders that he was convinced that His Majesty’s Government would afford the Company such assistance as they properly could in the promotion of their interests. Unfortunately, Mersina is not a convenient terminus, it possesses no harbour, and the road stead is much exposed. There is, accordingly, reason to fear that the Bagdad Railway Company will prefer to build a short branch line to Kastopol or Alexandretta.6 Part II. The Bagdad Bailway Contention of March 1903. The earlier phases of the negotiations between the Porte and the Anatolian Company are now of little more than historical interest, as the original Agreements underwent repeated and far-reaching modification, and were eventually superseded by two documents, the Bagdad Bailway Convention and the Statutes of the Societe Imperiale du Chemin de Per de Bagdad, both dated the 5th March, 1903. (See Appendix.) The original plan had been to carry on the trans-continental line, not from Konia, hut from Angora, the northern extension of the Anatolian Bailway system, through Sivas and Diarbekir to the Tigris. The Ottoman Government had from the first strongly favoured this plan, as it pre sented great strategical advantages. This view was throughly appreciated by the Bussian Gov ernment, who, as a measure of self-defence, concluded a Convention with the Porte, generally known as the “ Black Sea Basin Agreement,” in March 1900, which practically rendered im possible all railway construction in northern Asia Minor, unless under Bussian auspices. The Anatolian Company, partly no doubt on political, but mainly on commercial grounds, decided to reject the northern route in favour of the southern one. The text of the Convention will be found in the Appendix. The following are the main features of the Pinal Concession, as summarized in Mr. Chirol’s “ Middle Eastern Question ” :— “ From Konia the first section of the railway, which was opened to traffic in October 1904, presented no serious difficulties. It continues to run so far over the Anatolian Plateau at an altitude of about 3,000 feet. After reaching Eregli, however, it is immediately con fronted by the Taurus Mountains. Advantage is to be taken of the Chakit Su canon, and then of the Cilician Gates. Thence the railway will cross the small and fertile plain of Adana before scaling the second, but less formidable rampart, which falls away in easier slopes towards the basin of the Euphrates and Tigris. “ The two sections from Eregli to Adana, and from Adana to Tell-Habesh, where the branch line will7 diverge to Aleppo and Northern Syria, will certainly prove the most costly and difficult portion of the entire line, as they will necessitate altogether nearly 100 miles of blasting and tunnelling. After emerging from the Taurus Mountains the line, instead of sweeping round the foothills through the fairly populous and fertile districts of Urfa and Diarbekir into the upper valley of the Tigris and down to Mosul, is to be carried in a straight line across the desert, between the twin rivers of Mesopotamia to Mosul, and thence down the desolate right bank of the Tigris to Bagdad. It is true that a feeder is to be thrown out at Urta, and others are contemplated later on to Marash, Aintab, Birejik, Mardin, Erbil, and to Tuzkurmatli and Salahieh in the Kerkuk district. But the proposed route for the main line would hardly have been adopted by the Company, had not the kilometric guarantee rendered it financially independent of the immediate resources of the country to be traversed between the Taurus and Bagdad. “From Bagdad a very important branch is to go off to the Persian frontier at Khanikin, whence one of the chief trade routes into Persia lies through Kermanshah and Hamadan to Tehran. The annual value of the British trade carried on with Persia by this route (1902) is estimated, at 750,000/.—a fact which serves inci dentally to illustrate the many-sided bearings of the Bagdad Railway upon British interests. From Bagdad the main line is to trend back to the Euphrates, and cross it again in order to touch at the two sacred cities of the Shiah Mussulmans, Kerbela and Nedjef, where the mere pilgrim traffic from Persia and from India will prove a considerable source of revenue, on the w r ay down to Bussorah, the chief port of the Shatt- el-Arab, and to its appointed terminus, wherever that may ultimately be, on the Persian Gulf. The barest preliminary surveys have, however, yet been made of the Mesopotamian sections of the railway, which will certainly present some rather serious difficulties, owing to the intricate network of swamps and marshes that cover so large a portion of the great fluvial delta. “ The total length of the new railway, including the branches, for the construction of which immediate provision is made, is not set down anywhere in the Convention, even approximately, though, in view of the kilometric guarantee to which the Turkish Govern ment is pledged, it would seem to be a very material point. It may be estimated, roughly, at 1,750 miles, and if 638 miles be added for the existing Anatolian Railways, and for the Smyrna-Cassaba and Mersina- Adana Railways, which have already passed under German control, another 400 miles, the entire system wall amount to an aggregate of nearly 2,800 miles. “ The Concession is granted (Article II) for ninety- nine years, but in reality it will extend over a slightly longer period. For the ninety-nine years’ term will run for each of the sections, into which the line isri 1 8 be divided, from the date when the State bonds to be issued by the Ottoman Government are handed over in respect of it. The Anatolian Railways Concession, which was originally for a similar term of ninety-nine years, from 1888, is at the same time extended so as to cover the full period of the new Company’s Con cession. “ The new line is to be divided up for purposes of construction into sections, each of approximately 200 kilom. (Article III). These sections are not specified, but it is understood that, starting from Konia, the main line will comprise twelve sections, viz., Konia-Eregli (opened in 1004), Eregli-Adana, Adana-Tellhabesh (whence the branch line to Aleppo), Tellhabesh-Harran (whence the branch line to Urfa), Harran-Nussibin Kussibin-Mosul, Mosul-Tekrit, Tek- rit-Bagdad (with a branch line from Sadijeh to Khanikin, on the Persian frontier), Bagdad-Nedjef, Nedjef-Zubeir, and Bashar (two sections), and finally Zubeir to the Persian Gulf. “ Article IV binds the concessionnaire to begin work on the first section within three months from approval of the plans, and to complete it within two years. [It was actually completed in October 1004.] At the same time it is provided that the whole line and its branches shall be completed within eight years, a curiously short allowance for the completion of the other sections when compared with the two years allowed for completion of the first section alone. But this Article contains another still more curious provision. The term fixed for the completion of the whole line is subject not only to the punctual fulfilment by the Ottoman Government of its financial obligations towards the concessionnaire, but also to delays arising from force majenre; and force majeure includes, as well as war between European Powers, any radical change in the financial situation of Germany, Great Britain, or France. As there is nothing to indicate what shall be deemed to constitute such a radical change, nor who shall determine when such a radical change shall be held to have taken place, this provision appears liable to very elastic construction. “ The railway is to be built (Article VII) in the first instance for a single line, but a second line is to be laid when the gross kilometric receipts shall have reached 30,000 fr. per annum. “Article VIII provides for the creation of an Ottoman Joint Stock Company under the name of “ Imperial Ottoman Bagdad Railway Company,” which shall take the place of the Anatolian Railway Company in all that concerns the new line from Konia to the Persian Gulf with its branches. The Anatolian Company engages not to transfer its lines to any other than the Imperial Ottoman Bagdad Railway Company, and the latter binds itself not to part with its property in any shape or form. “ Article IX allows the Company during construction k r' i.9 to acquire and use steam and sailing vessels and other craft on the Shaft-el-Arab, the Tigris, and the Euphrates, for the transport of materials and other requirements. Considering how jealous the Turkish Government is of all navigation rights on those water ways, this clause, even with the restrictions attached to the permission, is of considerable significance, for when the Company has once acquired the plant necessary for navigating those waters, and established the wharves and warehouses it is entitled, under another Article of the Concession, to construct at Bagdad and Bussorah, it is improbable that it will consent to relinquish the advantages of navigation. “ Article XII opens up the way for an almost indefinite extension of the new Company’s control of the railways, not merely of Asia Minor and Meso potamia, but of Syria and Northern Arabia. Whilst professing to safeguard the rights of the Damascus— Hamah Railway Company, a French Company at present, it secures to the Bagdad Railway Company prior rights for the construction ot any branch con necting it with the Mediterranean between Mersina and Tripoli in Syria. The Bagdad Railway Company is thus brought into contact with the Syrian railway system, which is made up at present of several small lines which would therefore seem bound to pass ulti mately under the control of their powerful neighbour, and eventually, with the line which the Sultan is engaged m building from Damascus to Mecca, via M ezarib. “Article XXIII gives the Company the right to establish ports on the Tigris at Bagdad, on the Shatt- el-Arab at Bussorah, and at the terminal point on the Persian Gulf. With the powers conferred upon it the Company, as the owner of the wharves, quays, ware houses, &amp;c., which it is authorized to constiuct, must inevitably acquire complete coutrol of the traffic by water as well as by land. Mention may also be made in this connection of Article XXIX, which forbids the working of any section of the line between Bagdad and Bussorah that may have been built before com pletion of the main line from Konia to Bagdad. The new Company clearly has no wish to see that district opened up from the Persian Gulf before it has obtained access to it from the north. “ The financial obligations of the Ottoman Govern ment are set forth in Article XXXY. It guarantees a twofold kilometric annuity, one of 11,000 fr. per kilom., built and opened to traffic, and one of 4,500 fr. per kilom. towards working expenses, and provides for the mode of payment of those annuities. An Ottoman State Loan at 4 per cent., with a sinking fund of •087538 per cent., to be guaranteed by special appro priations, which shall be settled before the constiuction of each successive section is commenced, is to represent the kilometric annuity of 11,000 fr., the Company [399] ^receiving bonds of a face value of 269,110 fr. 65 c. per kilometre, built and opened to traffic. The annuity of 4,500 fr. per kilometre towards working expenses, which is to be gradually reduced as the gross kilometric receipts reach given amounts, is guaranteed on the surplus of the guarantees already appropriated to the Anatolian Railway. The Bagdad Railway Company, moreover, pledges to the holders of the State bonds the whole line from Konia to the Persian Gulf and its branches, and all its rolling-stock, &amp;c., and its share of the net receipts. The bondholders, however, will have no right to interfere in the administration of the Company. The liabilities of the Ottoman Government under this clause are heavy. It is true that in rtspect of the Anatolian Railway a kilometric guarantee only very slightly inferior in amount was given by the Porte, that the revenue of both the Konia and Angora lines has shown remarkable expansion, and that, as a set-off to the proportionately diminishing burden on the Treasury, Turkey has materially benefited by the increased prosperity of the provinces thus opened up to trade and agriculture. But the Anatolian Railway, like the two railways from Smyrna, has tapped the richest part of Asia Minor, and if the first two sections of the Bagdad Railway beyond Konia may also be expected to earn a fair revenue, the same can certainly not be predicated of the further sections, and especially not of those which cross the arid wastes of the Upper Euphrates and Tigris basin. There, even according to German estimates, many years, and even decades, must elapse before there can be any results to show for the heavy annual payments which the Turkish Exchequer will have to meet. Even in what were of old the most fertile tracts of Mesopotamia, extensive and costly works of both irrigation and drainage will be required in addition to the railway if anything like its ancient prosperity is to be restored. Many different calculations have been made as to the amount which the kilometric guarantee on the whole Bagdad line is likely to reach, and a very moderate estimate places it at over 1,000,000/. per annum, after allowing for probable revenue. How is the Turkish Exchequer, in its condition of chronic penury, to provide such a large sum ? The Convention itself leaves this question unanswered. But just after the conclusion of the 1902 Convention the Anatolian Company is believed to have intimated to the Porte that it would accept as security for the kilometric guarantee appropriations from an increase of the Turkish customs duties, from the creation of certain monopolies, or from the unification of the Ottoman Debt (which was actually accomplished in 1903). “Nor does Article XXNV represent the whole of Turkey’s financial obligations. Under Article XXXVII the Turkish Government is to provide two further annuities of 350,000 fr. each, one for a period of thirty years, to cover the cost of betterment works to the extent of 8,000,000 fr. on the Anatolian Company’s11 lines, and another to commence as soon as the new line reaches Aleppo, for the purpose of covering the cost of express train services. “ Under various other Articles a number of minor but valuable rights are conferred upon the Company; exemption from customs dues for all materials, machinery, rolling-stock, iron, wood, coal imported from abroad during the period of construction and extension, and exemption from taxation of the Com pany’s entire property and revenue during the whole term of the Concession ; mining and quarrying and forest rights within a zone of 20 kilom. on either side of the line; the right to establish warehouses, ele vators, &amp;c.; to manufacture bricks and tiles, and to make free use of any natural water power in the vicinity of the line for traction and lighting purposes; all of which tend to smooth the way for a monopoly of the economic exploitation of the country. “ The Company undertakes to make provision for postal and telegraphic services, under the control of the Ottoman Government, for the transport of troops in time of war and peace, and for the establishment, at its own expense, of the military posts required by the Ministry of War, up to a total expenditure of 4,000,000 fr., the Government, moreover, remaining at liberty to fortify all such points as it may deem neces sary. The Company also undertakes that within five years from the opening of each section the staff employed upon it, with the exception of the superior officials, shall be composed exclusively of Ottoman subjects. “ The constitution of the Imperial Ottoman Bagdad Railway Company, created under Article VIII of the Convention, is regulated by Statutes. The new Com pany is to have its seat at Constantinople. Whilst the Anatolian Railway Company undertakes, under Article V, to transfer to the new Company the Con cession granted to it under the 1903 Convention, it nevertheless preserves for its own exclusive benefit all rights and obligations concerning the old Anatolian Railway lines, as well as those which it derives from Articles II, XXXIII, and XXXVII of the above Convention. “ Under Article VI the initial share capital of the Company is fixed at 15,000,000 fr. “Article XII states that the Company will be administered by a Council of Administration, con sisting of eleven members, three' of whom shall be nominated by the Anatolian Railway Company. The others will be appointed by the general assembly. Three members shall be Ottoman subjects. “The most important Article, however, is Article XX, under which the Council is invested with the widest powers for administering the property and affairs of the Company, ‘ et pent meme transiger et compro- mettre! For it is in virtue of these powers that the Germans, being so far in sole control, were able to12 negotiate abroad, and make the proposals for British co-operation which His Majesty’s Government ulti mately had under their consideration.” Part III. The Anglo-German Negotiations of 1903. In December 1899 an Agreement was signed Sir N. O’Conor, ^ i 601 , between the Turkish Minister of Commerce and December 27, Dr. Siemens, Director of the Deutsche Bank, 18&lt;J 9. who was acting on behalf of the Anatolian Bailway Company, granting that Company a Concession for the extension of their line to Bagdad. This Agreement was eventually superseded by the Bagdad Bailway Convention of the 5th March, 1903, by which the Concession granted to the Anatolian Company was confirmed and extended. It was signed by Dr. Gwinner, President of the Deutsche Bank and successor to Dr. Siemens, and by Dr. Zander, President of the Anatolian Bailway Company, on the one side, and by the Turkish Minister of Commerce on the other. A further Agreement was signed the same gi r O’Conor, day, containing the Statutes of the Societe ^ 1 e 0S Imperiale Ottomane du Chemin de Per de Bagdad. Under Article V of these Statutes it is provided that the Anatolian Bailway Company, the original concessionnaire, shall transfer to the Bagdad Bailway Company (a Company intended to assume an international character) “ the Con cession which has this day been granted to it by the Ottoman Government, with all rights, privileges, and advantages attached thereto or resulting therefrom, and the new Company becomes owner and proprietor of the said Con cession, and succeeds to all the rights and obligations of the concessionnaire,” with the exception of those specially relating to the existing line (from Scutari to Konia) of the Anatolian Bailway Company. The Bagdad Bailway Concession was thus to be transferred to an international joint stock Company; and it was the wish of the German Syndicate to secure foreign, and particularly British, co-operation in financing the under taking.Sir N. O’Conor, ISo. 602, December 27, 1899. Sir N. O’Conor, .No. 130, April 10, 1900. Sir N. O’Conor, iNo. 145, March 26, 1902. Consideration of the Anglo-German negotia tions of 1903 may conveniently be prefaced by a short retrospect of private and official communi cations which took place between British and German Bepresentatives before that year. As early as December 1899 Dr. Siemens told His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople that he had decided, after ascertaining that there was no objection on the part of the German Government, to enlist British capital in the Bail way. With this purpose he had approached the Smyrna-Aidin Company. Although his overtures on this occasion had been unsuccessful, and he had afterwards come to an understanding with the (French) Smyrna-Cassaha Company, he hoped none the less to come to an arrange ment in course of time with British capitalists, and, in view of the opposition which the under taking would sooner or later encounter from Bussia, he considered it highly important to make the line as international as possible. On the 9th April, 1900, in the course of a conversation with Sir N. O’Conor respecting British relations with the Sheikh of Koweit, the German Ambassador stated that he was fully alive to the inadvisability of doing anything to deter British capitalists from participating in the construction of the line. In June 1901 it was agreed that the French and German groups should take part in the project in equal shares, and, in the event of British participation, each forgo an equal percentage of the capital to he subscribed. In March 1902 certain pourparlers, which led to no definite result, took place between Lord Hillingdon (of the Ottoman Bank), on behalf of the British group, and the French Syndicate. In the same month Lord Lansdowne had a conversation with the German Ambassador, in which he explained the attitude of His Majesty’s Government:— “ The Marquess of Lansdowne to Sir F. I^ascelles. “(No. 71.) li Foreign Office, “Sir, “ March 18, 1902. “ I told the German Ambassador to-day that the question of the attitude of His Majesty’s Government towards the Bagdad Railway had been a good deal discussed of late, and it might be as well that I should inform him of the purport of the answers which I had given when questioned upon the subject. [399] E“We did not regard the project with unfriendly eyes ; but if it was to be carried into effect with our support and good-will, we should expect that a share, at least equal to that given to any other Power, should be given to this country in respect of the capital employed for construction of the Hue, of its manage ment when completed, and of its orders for materials. “ Colonel Metternich observed that, so far as he was aware, ‘ the door was open,’ and there was no reason why any amount of British capital should not be invested in the line. On the other hand, if it were once constructed with capital from other countries, we could not expect to be allowed to come in afterwards. “ In reply to a question from him, I said that I understood the proposal to be that the Turkish Tariff should be increased in order to provide the necessary funds for a kilometric guarantee. It would no doubt be for us to consider, when the time came, whether we were justified in consenting to such an increase, and that would depend to a great extent on the adequacy of the share assigned to us in the enterprise. “ I am, &amp;c. (Signed) “ LANSDOWNE.” Desultory negotiations took place between the Separate Paper German Syndicate, on the one hand, and on the ^ rei 8 ' n other Mr. Clinton Dawkins (on behalf of Messrs, ber 13, 1902 Morgan), Sir E. Cassel, and Lord Hillingdon during the summer and autumn of 1902. No satisfactory agreement was reached, and a dispute arose between the Ottoman Bank and the Deutsche Bank as to which of them should place the London shares on the market. The connection of Messrs. Morgan with the concern was certainly unfortunate, owing to the distrust eu gendered in commercial circles by their action in regard to the Atlantic Shipping Combine. In a Minute dated the 18th June, 1902, on the subject of a proposal made by Lord Boths- child and Lord Bevelstoke that His Majesty’s Government should themselves take a part of the ordinary shares, as in the case of the Suez Canal, Lord Lansdowne observes :— “ It would, no doubt, be most unusual for a British Government to invest public money in such a project. On the other hand, the acquisition and retention by the British Government of a certain number of shares seems to be the only mode of securing for this country a permanent share in the control of the railway. If we were merely to guarantee a certain number of shares we should have no security that those shares would not find their way into the hands of foreign holders.”To Messrs. Baring', February 24, 1903. Memorandum handed to Lord Revelstoke, March 23,1903. 15 On the 21th February, 1903, Lord Lansdowne intimated to Messrs. Baring, Sir E. Cassel, and Sir 0. Dawkins that, in his opinion, it was undesirable that the railway should be carried out without the participation of Great Britain, and His Majesty’s Government arranged that the management of the British participation in the scheme should be placed in the hands of Messrs. Baring. During the same month arrangements were made that Lord Bevelstoke, on behalf of Messrs. Baring, should represent the British group officially at a meeting fixed to be held in Paris on the 21th March, for the purpose of settling and discussing details. At this meeting Lord Bevelstoke handed to Mr. Gwinner a Memorandum fixing and em bodying the objects for which, in the opinion of the representatives of the English group present, the assistance of His Majesty’s Government might he obtained. They stood as follows :— “ § 1. To agree to a reasonable increase in the Turkish Customs Tariff, in connection with the pending negotiations for a new Commercial Treaty, and to offer no opposition to the inclusion of a portion of the increased customs revenue among the guarantees for the Bagdad Company. “ § 2. Should the new route offer substantial advan tages over existing routes for the carriage of mails to India, to make use of it for the purpose on terms to be agreed upon between His Majesty’s Government and the Company. “ § 3. To give assistance (not, of course, pecuniary) towards the provision of a terminus, with proper facili ties, at or near Koweit, and co-operate in procuring convenient customs arrangements.” Mr. Gwinner suggested that the participation should take the following form :— 25 per cent, to Germany. 25 per cent, to England. 25 per cent, to France. 10 per cent, to the Anatolian Company. 15 per cent, to minor nations. On the 7th April Lord Lansdowne had a conversation with Lord Bevelstoke and Sir E. Cassel, which is recorded in the following Memorandum:— “ I told Lord Revelstoke and Sir E. Cassel that a serious attempt was apparently being made in the16 press to discredit the enterprise, and to render it impossible for His Majesty’s Government to associate themselves in any way with it, upon the ground that it was closely connected with the German Government and detrimental to British interests. We felt that, until we were better able to judge of the proportions which this hostile movement might assume, it would be desirable that we should avoid giving it any further encouragement. The matter would come before Parliament before the House adjourned, and we should, therefore, be better able in a few days to decide as to our future action. My own vieiv was that the attack teas founded upon misapprehensions, and I strongly deprecated any modification of the attitude which we had hitherto assumed. I was assured by Sir E. Cassel and Lord Revelstoke that they had up to the present in no way committed His Majesty’s Government. The formula given to Lord Revelstoke on the 23rd March had been used only for the purpose of sketching ‘ suggestions ’ which might be made to His Majesty’s Government on the part of the British group, should the British and foreign groups be able to come to terms. It was in these circumstances entirely for us to decide whether we desired to proceed further, and if the negotiations were continued, nothing could be concluded either as to the constitution of the Board of Directors or as to other matters of detail until we had been thoroughly satisfied. They explained to me that, in their view, the participation was to take place upon a ‘ basis of absolute equality as between English, French, and German interests,’ and that ‘ no one group was to be given any superiority or control.’ They also explained that the Anatolian Railway would be amalgamated with the main project, and that the three members of the Board who had been described as to be nominated by the Anatolian Railway would be nominated by the whole Board. France, Germany, and England would have eight members each, and no one Power would, therefore, be able to override the wishes of the other two, which would command 16 votes out of a total of 30. (Signed) “Lansdowne. “ Foreign Office, April 7, 1903.” Tho campaign of the anti-German journals was meanwhile becoming increasingly violent, and on the 23rd April a declaration was made in Parliament by the Prime Minister to the effect that His Majesty’s Government had withdrawn their support from the scheme. The nature of the press criticisms, and the extent to which they w r ere well founded, is con sidered in the final part of this Memorandum (see p. 26).17 Part IV, Prospects of Completion of the Line without The length of the main line of the Pagdad Pail way, from Konia to the Persian Gulf, will be about 1,350 miles. Prom Bagdad to Koweit the approximate distance is 450 miles. There is no reliable estimate of the cost of construction of the whole line. It is provided in Article XXXY of the Con vention that the Ottoman Government shall furnish a twofold guarantee in the form of kilo- metric annuities—one of 11,000 fr. per Idiom, built and opened to traffic, and one of 4,500 fr. per kilom. towards working expenses. These guarantees correspond to 1001. and 290/. per mile. Por the purposes of this Memorandum they will he referred to respectively as the “ construction ” annuity and the “ working ” annuity. The mode of payment is as follows: — An Ottoman State loan at 4 per cent., with a sinking fund of *087538 per cent., guaranteed by special appropriations (such as specific tithes), to be determined before the commencement of each successive section, is to represent the construc tion annuity. The working annuity is guaranteed on the surplus of the revenues already allocated to the kilometric guarantees of the Anatolian Pailway, and it is to be gradually reduced as the gross kilometric receipts reach given amounts. The loan to he issued for each of the twelve sections of approximately 125 miles (200 kilom.) is limited to 54 , 000,000 fr. The first section of the railway, from Konia to Eregli, was opened to traffic in October 1904. The construction loan issued for this section (Bagdad Pailway Loan, first series, 1903) was for £ T. 2,376,000 nominal. It was taken up at about 86 ^-, and produced £ T. 2,052,364. The estimates of the actual expenditure on the Konia-Eregli section show considerable dis crepancy. Those prepared at the Board of Trade by British Co-operation [399]18 Captain Bigham, in June 1905, place the cost of construction at 6,000Z. a-mile. The basis of this calculation is not indicated, but the writer concludes that there is a surplus of 1 , 000 , 000 /. in the hands of the Directors. On the other hand, in a Memorandum pre pared on the 31st July, 1905, Sir George Clarke suggests, under all reserve, that no balance from the loan of 1903 remains at the disposal of the Board, and contemplates the irregular distri bution of some 800,000/. of the Company’s money among bankers and underwriters of the loan. Any statistics on the subject must, indeed, rest, in the main, on the admissions of German financiers, and should be quoted under correction. From a careful comparison of available data the cost of actual construction per mile-would appear to have been approximately £ T. 3,500. If rolling-stock and faux frais be included, the cost amounts to £ T. 8,240 per mile, or £ T. 1,030,000 for the whole section of 125 miles. The sum allotted to bankers and underwriters is believed to have been about £ T. 582,000, leaving a balance of £ T. 440,000 in the hands of the Directors towards the cost of the next section. The next section—that from Eresrli to Adana— O is estimated to cost £ T. 16,000 to £ T. 20,000 per kilom. Taking the higher figure, the 200 kilom. will cost £ T. 4,000,000. The capital of the loan for each section is, however, fixed at 54,000,000 fr. If the issue price be the same as that of the first section, the sum raised will be £ T. 2,052,364, which will be insufficient. It is therefore proposed to complete three sections— i.e., 600 kilom.—at once. The capital raised for the three sections will be £ T. 2,052,364 X 3, or £ T. 6,157,092 ; and if the cost of construction per kilometre on the two last sections is assumed to be the same as that of the Konia-Eregli section, viz., £ T. 3,500 (with out rolling-stock), the sum required would be £ T. 3,500 X 400, or £ T. 1,400,000. If this sum be added to the cost of the Eregli-Adana section (£ T- 4,000,000), the total cost of constructin 0, o the three sections in question would be £ T. 5,400,000, whereas the loan issued for the three sections together would produce £ T. 6,150,000. This leaves a considerable margin in case either of the two last sections C )should cost more than the above estimate of £ T. 3,500, and there is still the reserve of £ T. 440,000 saved over the Ivonia-Eregli section for furtheir requirements in case of need—or, indeed, for rolling-stock. It may be objected that this estimate makes insufficient provision for rolling-stock, bankers’ commission, and faux-frais to Turkish officials. It would seem, however, reasonable to conclude that the proportionate expenditure on rolling- stock for the later sections will not be so great as upon the first, and that this item might in part be entered under working expenses. It cannot, moreover, be assumed that the rate of brokerage and commission will remain at 25 per cent, for each successive loan, nor that the inducements to Turkish officials will necessarily continue on so lavish a scale. The annual guarantee of the first loan (Konia- Eregli) amounts to £ T. 97,120, and is provided from the tithes of the Vilayets of Aidin, Bagdad, Diabekir, Mossoul, and Aleppo. Its collection is intrusted to the administration of the Ottoman Public Debt. For the three succeeding sections, on the basis already indicated, it will be necessary to find revenues for the service of a loan of 54,000,000 fr. X 3 or 162,000,000 fr.—say, £T. 7,128,000. At 4 J per cent, the sum required is £ T. 320,760. An examination of the available revenues will show that this sum will probably be forth coming. In the first place there is the surplus of the tithes collected by the Debt amounting to £ T. 300,000. The surplus of the revenues collected by the Debt, of which 75 per cent, revert to the Government, represent another £ T. 300,000, and this sum is considered likely to increase. It would seem that from these sources suffi cient money can be found for raising the construction capital. If the German authorities do not obtain, as they desire, the assignment of the surplus revenues of the Debt, the Government will probably be called upon, particularly if the im position of the Customs surtax is arranged, to assign fresh tithes. It should be borne in mind, however, that as soon as the Konia-Eregli section is linked to the seaboard the profits of the line will increase, and the working guarantees for that1 / 11,11 l i ^ 1 r l\ f 20 section will diminish in proportion, and may he utilized as a construction guarantee for the further sections. Nevertheless, if new tithes are required, it is stated that the Government have them at their disposal. The tithes of the Empire give £ T. 4,800,000, in round figures per annum. The amount assigned already for kilo metric guarantees is £ T. 1,700,000, leaving a balance of £T. 3,100,000. If they are placed in the hands of the Debt Administration, it is calculated that by a better system of collection they would yield 20 per cent, more. The Government could also still further pledge the Aghnam or sheep tax. It produces £ T. 1,976,000, of which £ T. 162,700 is already pledged, leaving a balance of £ T. 1,813,300. The system of collection is in course of improve ment. It is, indeed, evident that the Ottoman Govern ment cannot indefinitely continue on this course of pledging the best revenues of the country, and that a deficit in the National Exchequer will necessarily result. At the present time there would appear to be insufficient revenue to meet current expendi ture, the internal finances are in great disorder, and daily expenses are increasing by leaps and hounds owing to the general extravagance of Ottoman administration. The creation of fresh debt, and the assignment of fresh revenues for the service of new loans— the policy of the Erench Syndicates—and the appropriation of fresh revenues for the con struction of railways—the policy of the German Syndicates must eventually lead to disaster, and consequently to extended control by the Debt Administration. It may he that the Erench and German Syndicates realize that the crisis must come sooner or later, and prefer to hasten rather than retard it. An explanation of Germany^ wish for foreign co-operation may possibly be sought in the fear of this crisis. According to Article XXXV of the Convention of 1903, the “ working ” guarantee of 4,500 fr. per kilometre is to he paid from the surplus of the tithes at present assigned for payment of the company.HHMBSnSHHB 21 The average surplus for the five years ended 1901 is £ T. 49,574 In 1905, £ T. 25,266 was paid in kilometric guarantees towards the working of the Konia- Eregli section. With the tacit consent of the Government, ^ and by an arrangement between the various Railway Companies, the deficit in the sums assigned for the payment of kilometric guarantees on any one or more lines in Turkey is covered by the surplus on the other lines. The average surplus for the five years ended 1904 of the tithes in question, including the revenues assigned for the Osmanie and ^Fisheries Loans, which also come into the Agreement, was £ T. 229,737, This Agreement does not extend to the Bagdad line. If there is a deficit on that line it can only be made good from the surplus on the Anatolian lines, and not on the surplus of the kilometric guarantees in general. An arrangement might, however, easily be come to on this point. It would require the consent of the Government and an understanding between the French and German lines. If the French entered the Bagdad Railway Scheme such an arrangement might be concluded. Thus, in any case, there is a sum of £ T. 49,574 per annum available for the Bagdad Railway, and if a farther arrangement, as mentioned, is come to, there will be a surplus of £ T. 229,737. Further, the surplus of the Fisheries Loan—a German loan—amounts to over 56,000/., and might be earmarked for the railway. Moreover, the existing sections of the Anatolian line have caused, and will continue to cause, a steady and permanent increase in the tithes of the districts through which they pass. The general conclusion from the above statistics would appear to be that, from financial con siderations, British co-operation will not be a sine qua non of the construction of the railway, more especially if French capitalists take part in the scheme. A full survey of the line has not, however, yet been carried out, nor has any estimate of the cost of railway guards in the disturbed districts been prepared. There is the further element of a possible default on the part of the Ottoman Government, and of the crisis which would ensue. There is, therefore reason to suppose that Germany is averse to [399] Gtaking all the financial as well as political responsibilities of this great enterprise, and would welcome British and French co-operation. Yet if she is obliged to go on single-handed, it would appear that she will not be deterred, in spUe of the financial difficulties of the Turkish Treasury and of the obstacles which may be placed in the way of establishing a terminus at Koweit. Part Y. The Influence of the Bailway on British Interests. A railroad which owes its existence to an elaborate system of Government subsidies, and is destined to form a direct line of communica tion between the German Empire and the shores \ of the Persian Gulf, must be regarded in the light of no ordinary commercial venture. The promoters of this scheme have proclaimed Board of Trade their policy of supplanting British trade in a STqo'a 111 ’ region where till recently competition was non existent. The trade of Bussorah and Bagdad, valued at 2,500,000/. in 1903, has been a virtual monopoly of Great Britain and India; 50 per cent, of the river transport between these two towns has been effected in British bottoms; and of the total steam-ship tonnage entered in 1900 at Bussorah, 96 per cent, was British. Nor is the trade influence of the railway likely to be confined within the Mesopotamian vilayets, for its completion under German auspices bids fair to ruin British commerce with South-Western 1 cisia, and, in regard to one route alone, to involve an annual loss of 750,000/. If these facts are considered in conjunction with the projected economic penetration of a country, hitherto regarded as a possible outlet for the surplus populations of India, then, indeed, the Bagdad Bailway Scheme appears fi aught, in its commercial aspects alone, with potential consequences of a most serious and far- reaching character. In a review of the circumstances which led in 1903 to the refusal of His Majesty’s Government to lend the enterprise their support, His Majesty’s23 Sir N. ()’Conor, No. 217, April 28, 19&lt;&gt;3. Ambassador at Constantinople thus sums up bis conclusions:— “Nor must it be forgotten that the Railway Conces sion carries with it many valuable privileges and advantages. Apart from the large orders for materials for railway construction, &amp;c., it secures extensive mining rights on each side of the line, the right of navigation of the Tigris and Euphrates during the construction of the railway, a Concession which will probably be unlimitedly extended, a commercial outlet either at Koweit or elsewhere in the Persian Gulf, an exception ally favourable position in the future for all enterprise connected with the irrigation of Mesopotamia, &amp;c. Moreover, it can hardly be supposed that no effort will be made to supplant British navigation in its privileged position in the Persian Gulf, and to take advantage of the opportunity to compete with British shipping in those waters. “ It is also to be feared that the preponderance of foreign Powers in the valley of the Tigris will react upon British influence in Western Persia in the same way as England’s exclusion from a public enterprise so intimately connected with the progress and develop ment of the country will affect her prestige and position throughout Asia Minor.” On the 5th May, 1903, Lord Lansdowne made a declaration in the House of Lords to the following effect:— “ It is owing to British enterprise, to the expenditure of British lives and money, that the Persian Gulf is at this moment open to the navigation of the world. It was our ships that cleared those waters of pirates ; it was we who put down the Slave Trade ; it was we who buoyed and beaconed those intricate waters .... and, although we certainly could not aim at excluding the legitimate trade of other nations, this country stands with regard to the navigation of the Gulf m a position different from that of any other Power, and our policy should be directed to protect and promote British trade in those waters.” It would be difficult to contend that this policy is finding practical application, if a railway, calculated to dominate the principal markets of the Persian Gulf, is gratuitously abandoned to the control of an energetic and powerful rival; and the co-operation of Great Britain, as a measure of self-protection, would appear imperative, even if the contingency of financial difficulty cannot be altogether excluded. But it is not upon commercial considerations alone that the advent of a German railway mustoccasion concern. In an oft-quoted article, which appeared in the “ National Eeyiew ” of September 1902, Captain Mahan, U.S.N., expressed his views of British policy in the Gulf in the following sentence :— “ Concession in the Persian Gulf, whether by formal arrangement with other Powers or by neglect of the local commercial interests which now underlie political and military control, will imperil Great Britain’s naval situation in the Far East, her political position in India, her commercial interests in both, and the Imperial tie between herself and Australasia.” The General Staff, in a Memorandum (45 B) of the 15th November, 1901, “pointed out the disadvantages—political, commercial, and stra tegic—which the control by Germany of a line to the Persian Gulf would entail upon Great Britain.” At a meeting of the Imperial Defence Com mittee held on the 12 th April, 1905, the conclu sion was recorded “that it is important that England should have a share in the control of the extension of the Bagdad Bailway to the Persian Gulf, with a view to insuring the effective neutralization of the terminus.” In a Memorandum prepared for the Committee of Imperial Defence by Sir G. Clarke, on the 26th January, 1905, it is observed :— “ We are therefore confronted with a project which if carried out under German auspices, will undoubtedly inflict grave injury upon our commerce, and must ultimately destroy our political influence in Southern Persia and in the deltas of the Tigris and Euphrates. We have the strongest grounds for preventing the control of a railway from Bagdad to the Gulf from falling wholly under the control of a Power which regards its own interests exclusively, and which well understands the manipulation of railway rates.” While such is a summary of authoritative statements in regard to the detrimental effects upon British interests of a railway placed under the exclusive control of a great military and industrial nation, the balance of opinion would appear to favour the view that, if the line were made a joint concern, or to be internationalized, the damage to British prestige would not be so evident, and that to military interests consider ably modified, while the competition to commerce would be rather stimulating than destructive.The various conditions which, in the event of British participation in the scheme, are considered of importance, and practical suggestions for the conclusion of an international arrangement on the subject, are set forth in some detail in the sub joined Memorandum, which was prepared by Sir G. Clarke in August 1905 :— “ If the construction of the line is proceeded with, our object must be to secure the control of the Bussorah— Bagdad section. “ It seems possible that Germany might be induced to yield that condition if we met her in other directions. “ M. Cambon, in a recent conversation with Lord Lansdowne, expressed the opinion that the French Government would not favour this proposal, but it is doubtful whether the French Government has given full consideration to the subject. “ At present Germany has complete control over the Anatolian Railway, and France has a monopoly of railway construction in Syria as far south as Mezerib. “ British control of the Bussorah-Bagdad section might fairly be regarded as a legitimate counterpoise to the French and German railways in Syria and Asia Minor respectively. “In view of our present cordial relations with the French Government, it seems probable that, if repre sentations were made, no opposition would be offered to the proposal that we should control this section of the line, more particularly as we should undertake not to establish differential tariffs in our own favour. ‘•It is clear from the former negotiations that the German Government is strongly averse from the inter nationalization of the Anatolian Railway. W e might without serious disadvantage consent to the Anatolian Railway remaining under German control, provided that \yq were given control of the Bussorah—Bagdad section, and that the 10 per cent, participation and share in the directorate by the Anatolian Railway of the Bagdad Railway previously stipulated for were withdrawn. “France, Germany, England, and the minor Powers might then combine to participate m the construction, on an international basis, of that part of the Bagdad Railway which lies between Konieh and Bagdad (about 900 miles), together with any branches that might be constructed between these two points, such as those to Alexandretta and Aleppo. “The Board of the international section might be composed in the following proportion :— Country. Percentage, Great Britain France ... Germany Minor nations 30 30 30 10 Total 10026 “ Or, if there is any possibility of inducing the United States to participate, the proportion might be :— Country. Percentage. Great Britain 22 United States 22 France ... 22 Germany 22 Minor nations 12 Total 100 “Provision would have to be made to secure to participants proportionate shares in the provision of railway materiel for the international proportion of the line. It would further be desirable that arrangements should be made to pool the receipts of the German, French, English, and International Companies, and that a mutual guarantee should be given by all the Companies that they will not establish discriminating tariffs in favour of or against the trade of individual nations. “ Such arrangements would concede to the Germans a point which they were clearly unwilling to yield in the former negotiations ; and, provided that access to Alexandretta by the international line is assured, the Germans, even if they evaded the Agreement by granting rebates on the Anatolian Railway to German traders, would not be able to injure our trade on any section of the line to Konieh, as goods arriving via the Mediterranean would be sent to Konieh as cheaply by Alexandretta as by Haidar Pasha. “An arrangement of the nature described above would require the establishment of a clearing-house charged with the duty of apportioning receipts and expenditure on through traffic. The management of the clearing-house would be in the hands of a Mixed Committee of the several Boards. If the entire system could be placed under bond Jide international control, British interests would be adequately safeguarded, but the difficulties appear insuperable. It is extremely unlikely that the Germans would consent to internationalize the Ana tolian Railway, while the French would probably object strongly to a similar arrangement in regard to the Syrian lines. “ ^n the whole, the arrangement above suggested seems the most practical at the present time, and it might be desirable to sound the French Government on the subject. “ The following is a summary of the proposals “ (a.) Germany to retain control and management of the Anatolian Railway. “ (b.) h ranee to retain control and management of the Syrian railways. “ (c.) Great Britain to construct, control, and manage the Bagdad Gulf section.1 Board of Trade Memorandum, June 1905. 27 “ (d.) The intervening section, with branches and connections, to be internationalized. “ (&lt;?.) The international section to be controlled by a Board on which the Great Powers are equally represented. “ ( f.) Materials for the international section to be provided by the Powers in proportion to their financial participation. “ (g.) The Powers to undertake not to impose differential rates on the sections they severally control. “(A.) The receipts on the entire system to be pooled and distributed by a clearing-house managed by a Committee from the several Boards.” In addition to the above-mentioned conditions, Article XXIX of the Bagdad Bailway Convention would have to he so modified as to admit the working of the Bagdad Gulf section as soon as completed. In the opinion of the Board of Trade it is also essential that the waterways in this region, as well as the railroad, should be under British control, not only in order to facilitate the work of construction, but also to prevent the Turkish steamers on the Tigris from undercutting the railway freights. Down-stream rates are some times as low as ^d. per ton per mile, whereas the lowest freight rates on the Anatolian Bailway in 1902-1903 averaged fd. |\ * It remains to consider the causes of the violent outburst in the press, which, in 1903, rendered the negotiations with Germany abortive, and whicli, in the event of a renewal of negotiations at the present time, would not improbably occasion much anxiety in regard to their success. This popular indignation was largely influenced, firstly, by resentment at the attitude of Germany during the South African War; and, secondly, by misapprehension as to the conditions under which it was proposed to enlist British capital, and, indeed, as to the ability of Germany to utilize the Concession single-handed. Motives of sentimental aversion constitute no sufficient reason for refusal to engage in business which can be shown, on investigation, to be bene ficial to the parties concerned. On the other hand, those considerations whicli led, on practical grounds, to substantial objections on the part ofthe investing public are of practical significance, and accordingly deserving of the most careful attention. Into this subject His Majesty’s Ambassador at Sir N. O’Conor Constantinople entered at considerable length in April 28, 1903 a despatch dated the 28th April, 1903:— “ It is to be regretted that misapprehensions have been caused by incomplete or incorrect publication of the documents in the case. The Concession for the Bagdad Railway was obtained in the first instance by the Anatolian Railway Company. It is therefore natural that, in the Convention of the 5th March, 1903, embodying this Concession, that Company appears as the concessionnaire of all rights and privileges in question. It does not, however, remain in possession of these rights. Under Article 5 of the Statutes of the ‘ SocietS Imperials Ottomans da Chsmin ds Fsr de Bagdad’ it is provided that the Anatolian Railway Company shall transfer to the new Company ‘the Concession which has been granted to it by the Imperial Ottoman Government, with all rights privileges, and advantages attached thereto or re suiting therefrom, and the new Company become owner and proprietor of the said Concession, and succeeds to all the rights and obligations of the con cessionnaire,’ with the exception of those specially relating to the existing line of the Anatolian Railway Company “ The result of the constitution [of the Board of the new Company, as proposed in 1903] would be that any two of the groups [German, French, and English] could command an absolute majority, and that the Company would be really international in the sense that it would be impossible to direct its policy and working to the benefit of any single country at the expense of the others. “ It has been represented that the Railway could be worked in a manner detrimental to British commerce by means of direct or indirect advantages, of special raxes, through rates, rebates, or exemptions accorded to the goods of other countries, or to goods arriving by particular routes. This apprehension is not well founded. Such preferences are directly prohibited by Articles 24 and 25 of the ‘ Cahier des Charges’ of the Bagdad Railway, and by corresponding provisions applicable to the Anatolian Railway. They would also be excluded by a clause of the proposed Treaty of Commerce; and, in any case, the execution of these stipulations in the spirit, as well as in the letter, could undoubtedly be secured by the participation of British capital and the consequent international character of the Company. “ It has been pointed out, in the course of the dis cussions in the press and elsewhere, that, so long as the Anatolian Railway from Haidar Pasha to Konia remains in German hands, the international characterof the line from Konia onwards will not be a sufficient guarantee for impartial treatment; that the German Company will, in fact, hold the key of the door by which the through traffic must pass. This is a point of the first importance, deserving careful consideration ; but an examination of the whole position will go far, at any rate, to dispel any anxiety on this account. In the first place, the representatives of the Anatolian Railway Company have formally announced their readiness to vest the control of their line in the Inter national Company at some future period; and there are sufficient guarantees for the carrying out of this undertaking in the fact that it would be open to the British Government, in the event of failure to carry it out, to refuse the promised facilities for a port in the Persian Gulf, and to withdraw their assurance as to conveyance of the Indian mails; and also in the fact that, when the Bagdad line has been completed throughout the greater part of its length, it would be so indispensable to the prosperity of the Anatolian line that the latter could not afford to take up a hostile or exclusive attitude. This is the more certain since Haidar Pasha does not afford the only point of access. * * * * “ Fears have been expressed that at one moment or another either Germany or France, or possibly both countries, may, for political reasons, come to terms with Russia and find it in their interest to make over their share, or else to buy off her hostility by supporting her claims for Russian access to the shores of the Persian Gulf. These are contingencies, however, which might arise in any case, whether England participates or not in the construction of the Railway. Indeed, an arrangement with Russia would be more urgently required, and at the same time more easy of accomplishment, if England stands out than if she participates. “As regards the probability of incurring Russian hostility, it must be remembered that French financiers have certainly not engaged themselves in the scheme without the approval of their Government, and I have reason to believe that this approval was given with the knowledge and consent of their ally. Although, therefore, it cannot be expected that Russia will view with indifference any extension of foreign, and specially, perhaps, of British, influence in the region of the Gulf, it does not seem likely that this enterprise is of a nature to arouse her ill-will towards England in a specially marked degree.” The principal contentions of the press in regard to the inadvisability of British participa tion are dealt with in the extracts from Sir N. O’Conor’s despatch, but particular capital was made out of certain assurances which were requested from His Majesty’s Government in [399] I30 the event of a basis of co-operation being agreed npon. The assurances in question were as follows :— 1. That objection should not be raised to the increase of the Turkish customs duties, of which a part should be used in guarantees for the Bagdad Bail way. 2. That if the Bailway should prove a sub stantially better route for conveying 4 |}e mails to India, it should receive the subsidy at present granted to British steam-ship lines. 3. That His Majesty’s Government should lend their good offices in providing a proper terminus at or near Koweit. The first and third points are now devoid of practical interest, since the increase of the customs is in process of arrangement, and the additional revenue is to he devoted to the require ments of Macedonian reform ; while a British officer, dispatched to the Persian Gulf on a special mission to carry out surveys on the spot, has recently reported that Koweit is by no means the only convenient terminus, various places, outside the limits of any possible extension of British protection, being equally suitable for the purpose in view. The second point is one of considerable importance. It is, however, merely a question of degree, and it may be doubted whether the compensatory gains to British trade as a whole would not, in the long run, outweigh the immediate loss incurred by the mercantile marine.

O’Conor, No. 602, December 7, 1899. DURING the German Emneror^s visit in 1898, the proposal to construct a line from Con stantinople to Bagdad came into notice, with several other suggestions, as to German enter prise, which excited some attention at the time, hut was not taken very seriously. Subsequently, in 1899 the German Govern ment and German business men made attempts to obtain a Concession for the construction of a railway from Anatolia to the Persian Gulf, but there was much obstruction on the part of the Turkish authorities. In November of that year Sir N. O’Conor reported that the Turkish Government was strongly opposed to placing the line in German hands. Eventually the Germans, by special favour of the Sultan, and a lavish expenditure of money at the Palace (generally computed at 200,000/.), obtained an Irade, granting them a Concession which was, in principle, what they sought. This Concession, however, left all details to he settled at some future date. On the 23rd December, 1899, an Agreement between the Turkish Minister of Commerce and Dr. Siemens was signed, giving the latter per mission to prolong the Anatolian Railway to Bagdad. All questions of guarantee and the like were deferred until full investigations had been made by a Commission, which was dispatched by the Genpans to examine minutely the whole of the country traversed by the proposed railway. Referring to the above Agreement, Dr. Siemens told Sir N. O’Conor that the original initiative had been taken by the Sultan personally, who had asked him (Dr. Siemens) whether he was willing to construct the line.After mature consideration, Dr. Siemens de cided to enlist, if possible, British capitalists in the scheme; and, as a first step, he ascertained from the Berlin Foreign Office that there was no objection, on the part of the German Govern ment, to British participation in the venture. On the strength of this, Dr. Siemens made overtures to the Smyrna-Aidin Bailway Com pany, which, however, w r ere rejected. He then applied to the (French) Cassaha Bailway Com pany, although he preferred British co-operation to French, and came to an understanding with them—though at the time he had not quite aban doned the hope of obtaining British assistance. On the 15th' April, 1900, Sir N. O’Conor, in 1 the course of an interview with the Minister for Sir N. 0 Foreign Affairs, reminded him that a rumour Apul 16 had come to his Excellency’s notice that the Turkish Government proposed to send a Customs inspector and a harbour-master to Koweit. His Excellency insisted on the fact that, although the British Government did not wish to interfere with the Sultan’s authority in the Persian Gulf, still they were desirous of maintaining the status quo, and could not view with indifference any action which would alter it or give another Power rights or privileges over territory belonging to the Sheikh of Koweit. The same afternoon his Excellency saw the German Ambassador, and in order that no doubt should remain in his mind, explained to him very explicitly the British official view of Koweit, making it quite clear that the Sheikh was not at liberty to cede or otherwise alienate to the Bailway Company either the harbour of Kathama or any part of his territory, without the consent of His Majesty’s Government. His Excellency also said that he was anxious that nothing should take place which would deter British capitalists from taking part in the scheme, provided of course that they obtained fair terms. In the course of further conversation, Baron von Marschall expressed the hope that the British and Germans would come to an understanding mutually beneficial. * * In the year 1901, in August, Lord Lansdowne, in a despatch No. 285 of the 16th August, 1901, informed Sir F. Lascelles that Count Metternich had called at the Foreign Office, where his Lordship repeated to him the substance of this information, without, however, referring to participation by British capitalists.mam w—mmmm 1902. o 1001 . Sir N. O’Oonor, July 1, 1901. Sir N. O'Conor, March 26, 1902. The Exploring Commission sent by the Ger mans completed its researches in 1900, and in June 1901 matters began to take definite shape. The Erench and German capitalists negotiated among themselves, and after some difficulty came to the following agreement, viz.:— That Erance and Germany should participate equally in the project, each providing 50 per cent, of the capital.*' British capitalists were not actually approached, and Sir N. O’Conor was of opinion that they would not take up the matter unless they received some encouragement from official quarters. He suggested to Mr. Babington-Smith (British Com missioner on the Ottoman Public Debt) that he should communicate with Sir Clinton Dawkins (of the firm of Messrs. J. S. Morgan and Co.) on the subject. This, as far as we are aware, was the first occasion on which the scheme was brought to the notice of British financiers in London. In November 1901 a draft of the Convention was prepared by the Germans, and on the 16th January, 1902, an Irade was granted sanctioning its issue. On the 21st this Convention was signed by Zilmi Pasha on one part and Dr. Zander and M. Huguenin on the other. A copy was sent home by Sir N. O’Conor in his despatch No. 30 of the 27th January, 1902, and a precis of it, together with a Memorandum showing the principal modifications introduced into the original scheme, is printed in the Appendix. Two Annexes were also made to the Conven tion, viz,:— Annex I. The Anatolian Company undertook that the annuities mentioned in Article XNXV would not be charged to the existing revenues of the State, but to others which might be realized at some future time, viz. :— 1. Increase of customs duties. 2. Creation of five monopolies. 3. Economies relating to the unification of the Public Debt. * * This agreement was kept secret at the time, and our first definite information on the subject was obtained by Sir N. O’Conor from M. Constans, his French colleague, in MarchHI il I Annex II. The Company undertook not to colonize any part of the line :— Early in March 1902 the Deutsche Bank pre- Sir N. O’Conor, sented to the Ottoman Bank an Agreement to 1992 . ’ form a Syndicate to carry out the Concession. Lord Lansdowne was of opinion that the moment was ripe to explain to the Germans that the port of Koweit would only be open to them on the understanding that British capital was placed on an equality with that of Erance and Germany; Sir N. O’Conor concurred in this view. On the 24th April Sir X. O’Conor was in structed by telegraph to inform the Sublime Porte that England was obliged to afford the Sheikh of Koweit full assistance against any attempt to encroach on his territories; that the British Government did not wish to obstruct the Bagdad Bailway, but unless British capital received a fair share in the enterprise, in respect of construction and materials, England would not undertake to constrain the Sheikh, whose good will was essential to the railway’s success. Sir X. It. O’Conor laid these points before the Grand Vizier, but was unable to refer to the subject of participation to avoid arousing the Sultan’s fears of an international control of the line. In April Sir X. It. O’Conor saw the German Ambassador, and pointed out to him that until quite lately England had been kept in the dark as to the real terms and conditions upon which the Erench Syndicate had agreed. He stated that English capitalists could only count on the British Government’s support on the condition that they had an equal share with the others, and he drew attention to the fact that British interests were threatened by the proposed increase of customs duties which was to meet the guarantee. Early in June Count Vitali, acting for the Erench, and Dr. Zander for the German group, began to arrange differences, and fixed a meeting to be held in Paris on the 20 th June. Sir X. 11. O’Conor suggested that this would be a good occasion to present British demands through Sir Clinton Dawkins, in order to ascer tain unofficially how matters stood. Lord Lans downe agreed to this, but held that the Morgan firm was not particularly suitable to represent To Sir N. O’Conor, Telegraphic, March 24, 1902. Sir N. O’Conor, No. 144, March 25, 1902.

British capitalists, owing to its American character and to the recent friction over the shipping combine for traffic between England and the United States. At the beginning of September 1902 Sir Clinton Dawkins, on behalf of Morgan and Co., interviewed Mr. Gwinner, who argued that it had been agreed to allot 40 per cent, to Germany, 30 per cent, to Erance, 20 per cent, to England, and 10 per cent, divided between Austria and Switzerland; Sir Clinton Dawkins replied that such an arrangement was practically out of the question, and that Great Britain could not on such terms as these consent to any increase of the Turkish Customs Tariff for the purpose of providing a guarantee for the line. Mr. Gwinner then made a tentative off’er of 10 per cent, to the Anatolian Railway Company, 30 per cent, to London, 30 per cent, to Paris, and 30 per cent, to Berlin. Sir Clinton Dawkins considered that this was more reasonable, but remarked that the Anatolian Railway Company was a German concera. Mr. Gwinner replied that, even so, it was only fair that that Company should benefit, on account of the many services it had rendered in the past. In October Sir N. R. O’Conor had an inter view with Mr. Gwinner, in the course of which the latter stated that, until some understanding was arrived at about the increase of the customs duties in order to provide a guarantee for the most costly portions of the line, nothing could he done as regards serious construction, although the line might be prolonged another 200 kilom. over level country if the Ottoman Government could provide a guarantee from other sources for this section. This has proved a very accurate forecast of what has since taken place. About this time an attempt was made to fuse the Anatolian Railway Company with the Oriental Eailways Company' ::: ' (whose system extends from Constantinople to the Bulgarian frontier and the Aegean, and from Salouica to the Servian frontier), but this attempt failed owinsrto the action of the Austrian Government. On the 16th Eebruary, 1903, an Agreement was signed at Berlin by the German and Erench groups (Deutsche and Ottoman Banks), con- * The Germans claimed to own 80 per cent, of the shares, of the Oriental Railways. [1279] C6 ( cerning their participation in the projected rail way, and reserving for England an equal share in case she joined in the project. On the 24th February Lord Lansdowne gave Baring Brothers, Sir E. Cassel, and Sir Clinton Dawkins to understand that he considered it undesirable that the railway should be carried out without the participation of England, and arranged that the above-mentioned business men should have charge of British interests as far as financial negotiations were concerned. On the 5th March a contract was signed by Mr. Gwinner and accepted by the Turkish Commissioner of the Public Debt, for raising a loan of 2,160,000/. at 4 per cent, to provide for the construction of the Konia-Eregli section. On the same day the Minister of Finance signed the Statutes of the Bagdad Company. During the same month arrangements w r ere To Sir N. O’Conor,, made that Lord Bevelstoke should represent the March 20 ’ 1908 - British group officially at a meeting fixed to be held in Paris on the 24th March for the purpose of settling and discussing details. At this meeting Lord Bevelstoke handed to Memorandum, Mr. Gwinner a Memorandum fixing and em- Apnl 7 ’ 19 ° 3 ' bodying the objects for which, in the opinion of the representatives of the English group present, the assistance of His Majesty’s Government might be obtained. They stood as follows :— § 1. To agree to a reasonable increase in the Turkish Customs Tariff in connection with the pending negotiations for a new Commercial Treaty, and to offer no opposition to the inclusion of a portion of the increased customs revenue among the guarantees of the Bagdad Com pany. § 2 . Should the new route offer substantial advantages over existing routes for the carriage of mails to India, to make use of it for the pur pose on terms to be agreed upon between His Majesty’s Government and the Company. § 3. To give assistance (not, of course, pecu niary) towards the provision of a terminus, with proper facilities, at or near Koweit, and co operate in procuring convenient customs arrangements. Mr. Gwinner suggested that the participation of the various groups in the scheme should take the following form :—25 per cent, to Germany. 25 per cent, to England. 25 per cent, to France. 10 per cent, to the Anatolian Company. 15 per cent, to minor nations. Sir N. O’Conor, Telegraphic, June 19, 1903. Sir N. O’Conor, No. 787, November 25, 1903. Sir N. O’Conor, No. 831, December 15, 1903. Sir E. Cassel suggested the allotment of 26 per cent, to the three first, in order to avoid the out-voting of two of the main participators by a third in combination with the Anatolian Company and minor nations. Mr. Gwinner objected, and the matter remained in abeyance. Mr. Gwinner also wished to introduce the word “Ottoman” before “Customs” in § No. 3 of the Memorandum handed him by Lord Level stoke; this, however, was not embodied, and, while the matter was still under discussion, a sudden outcry against British participation was raised in the English press and Parliament. On the 23rd April Mr. Balfour stated in Parliament that the conditions proposed were such as the British Government were unable to agree to. After this breakdown of negotiations there was a pause in the negotiations for a short time, hut early in June a meeting was held at Berlin by the German and French Syndicates, at which they came to an understanding—viz., 40 per cent, to France, 40 per cent, to Germany, and 20 per cent, reserved for Austria, Switzerland, Constantinople, and Italian groups. This plan was not approved by M. Lelcasse, but was not abandoned by the French group. ' In December Mr. Gwinner called on Sir N. E. O’Conor, and, in the course of conversation, expressed his regret at the breakdown of negotia tions in the spring; he attributed the failure entirelv to the sudden ebullition of public opinion in England, which had deterred both the British Government and the British Syndi cate from proceeding with the business. He regretted the failure the more, as he had accepted nearly all Sir E. Cassel’s proposals concerning * Note on the French Group.—The following is supplied by a prominent English financial authority: “ There cannot be said to be a French group in the Bagdau Company, the French Government having shown its dis approval, and having refused to allow an official quotation of the Paris Bourse to any issue. “ The Imperial Ottoman Bank is, however, a shareholder in its role as banker only, and not as representative of a French group holding 25 per cent.”8 mm the amalgamation of the Anatolian Company with the British line, and he added that, with the consent of his Government, he had even been prepared to waive the amendment as regards customs at Koweit, as the Bailway Com pany did not care in the least whether Koweit was a British Protectorate or not, only wishing to avoid two customs inspections for goods passing along the line—viz., one by Koweit and one by the Turkish authorities. Sir N. B. O’Conor replied that it would have greatly assisted an arrangement had the con struction of the Persian Gulf end of the line been given over to the British; to this Mr. Gwinner replied that, for his part, he would have been quite willing to agree to this, but if he did so he could not have been expected to give up the Anatolian section wdiile leaving the Persian Gulf end to England; further, Bussia might have objected, and thus caused some unpleasantness. Sir Conyngham Greene reported from Berne gi r Greene, in October 1903, that a complete understanding L o October 12 1903 was arrived at between the French and German ’ groups. Mr. Block (Mr. Babington-Smith’s successor 1904. as British Bepresentive on the Ottoman Public Sir N. O’Conor, Debt) reported in February 1904 that the Konia * ebruar y 23 ’ 1904 * tithes which had been assigned for the kilometric guarantee of the Konia-Eregli section had been replaced by the tithes on a selection of Cazas in the Vilayets of Bagdad, Aidin, Mossul, and Diarbekir, owing to the Bussians objecting to the Konia Cazas being touched, the latter being already hypothecated for the Bussian war indemnity. The prospectus of the loan on the above sir N. O’Conor security was made public in October, and soon No - B October 11, after successfully floated. 1904 ‘ On the 25th October the Konia-Eregli section was inaugurated with great ceremony. The Imperial Defence Committee held a meeting on the 12th April last, at which they came to the conclusion that it is important that England should have a share in the control of the extension of the Bagdad Bailway to the Persian Gulf, with a view to insuring the effective neutralization of the terminus. In June Memoranda were prepared at the Board of Trade, Board of Trade summarizing the condition of June 23 ’ 1905 - affairs.9 Sir N. O’Conor, Private, July 12, 1905. Sir N. O'Conor, No. 485, July 19, 1905. The conclusions arrived at were briefly as fol lows :— “ (a.) That the Germans are determined to build the Bagdad line somehow, and that it appears reasonably probable that they may succeed in doing so without our participation. “ (b.) That if it is built without our anticipation our general position in this part of Western Asia in the future will be worse than it is now. ie (c.) That we are not likely to get a better oppor tunity for negotiation than the present. “ (d.) That we should therefore participate it the Germans will admit us, and if we can secure for our selves the Bagdad-Persian Gulf section, the navigation of the Lower Tigris, and equal commercial treat ment.” On the 12th July Sir N. B;. O’Conor happening to see Dr. Zander, Director-General of the Anatolian Bailway, his Excellency inferred that the Doctor w T as still desirous of England’s participation, even if this entailed granting a special arrangement for the construction of the Bagdad-Bussorah section, though he was careful not to commit himself definitely. Sir N. B. O’Conor assured Dr. Zander that he personally entirely shared his desire for an understanding between the twm countries on this great enterprise, hut that he could not answer for the views of His Majesty’s Govern ment at the present moment, or say how far they would be prepared to go in the matter, but that he thought that nothing w r ould he lost by a private exchange of views—say, between Mr. Gwinner and Mr. Babington-Smith—as to the present position of the question, should an opportunity offer for their meeting in the Black Eorest or elsewhere during the former’s holidays. During the same month Lord Lansdowne saw the French Ambassador, wdio assured his Lord- ship that France w 7 as absolutely unconnected with the raihvay, and had been ever since the breakdown of 1903; he remarked, however, that the idea of allowing England to undertake the construction of the Bagdad-Bussorah section did not seem to him a good one, as it would be obvious that the British Government had a “ visee politique ” in the matter—he personally favoured an international basis throughout. Towards the end of July Mr. Barry, Director of the Ottoman Bank in London, called at the Foreign Office and informed Sir T. Sanderson [1279] Dthat Mr. Gwinner’s agent had told him that British participation had been decided upon through Sir N. It. O’Conor, England receiving the Bagdad-Bussorah section, an arrangement to which France would consent. He added that it was stated that Messrs. Speyer and Co. would he charged with the formation of the British group. Mr. Barry was informed that this went far beyond any substantial fact, although indications were not wanting to prove that the Germans might be favourable to some such arrangement us Mr. Gwinner’s agent had mentioned. Sir N. O’Conor, who was consulted as to this communication, replied that he had no doubt that Dr. Zander had greatly exaggerated the importance of his personal remarks as to the desirability of British participation, but he pointed out at the same time the advantages of keeping a door open to future negotiations, without pledging the Government officially. His Excellency further suggested that, in event of France objecting to an c&lt; all-British ” control over the Bagdad-Bussorah section, the fact that France was acquiring a sole interest in the Syrian railways might he considered as a counterpoise. Lord Lansdowne replied that, under the present circumstances, overtures to Germany were undesirable, and that internationalization was the best solution—viz, France, United States, and England admitted on equal terms. Shortly afterwards Sir N. O’Conor expressed his views as follows (see his despatch No. 572 of the 20 th August) :— “ It has been my view that the railway will eventually be constructed, even without the participation ot England, and that a project which has already assumed such definite shape, and is fraught with such immense political and commercial consequences and advantages, Avill not be allowed to drop easily, whatever may be our ultimate decision, though no doubt we can impede or advance its development and progress to a con siderable and serious extent. “ It may not be without interest to state that the Konia-Eregli section was built at a cost of £ T. 700,000, and allowing £ T. 200,000 for various initial expenses, there remains in the hands of the Deutsche Bank the sum of at least £ T. 1,200,000 over from the Bagdad Railway Loan (first series). This surplus is being- reserved for the purpose of constructing the next section of the line, which will require a capital of To Sir N. O’Conor, August 5, 1905. To Sir N. O’Conor, No. 110, Telegraphic, July 81, 1905. To Sir N. O’Conor, No. 144, Telegraphic, August 1, 1905.nil. ■.■u.iiiiinmmMP 5 £ T. 3,200,000. The Company will therefore be obliged to raise £ T. 2,000,000 before commencing active con struction. “ However, the surplus of the revenues assigned to the Fisheries Loan and other unhypothecated revenues still at the disposal of the Turkish Government would be ample for guaranteeing this loan. ‘‘ Taking these facts into consideration, it may bo easily conceived that the work may be resumed at no very distant date, and I would lay stress on the fact that every section of the line constructed makes the ultimate completion of the railway more certain, and that if the Germans overcome the difficulties of the Taurus Mountains unaided, they may feel less inclined to share the fruits of their labours with others; for then they will be within reach of the rich tracts of Mesopotamia, where the obstacles to construction become less serious, and the prospects of success more inviting.” The question of British participation was raised again last month. Sir E. Eitzgerald Law had communications with Herr Gwinner, of which the Eoreign Office were informed. The Germans apparently are willing to allow British control over a section from Koweit to Bussorah, or even further, and also to meet us over the question of the terminal at or near Koweit (Umkasr at some distance from Koweit is considered a likely terminus, and, unfortunately, the Sheikh’s claims to it are so weak that we might have much difficulty in opposing any action which the Turkish Government might take in regard to it). But a provision is inserted in the concession that the whole line must be completed before the most easterly section is opened to traffic. British control over the section would for this and other reasons he a very inadequate concession, unless it were combined with a general participation in the whole enterprise. It is supposed (though there is some uncer tainty on the point) that an undistributed surplus of about 800,000/. remains over from the construction of the Konia-Eregli section which can he applied towards the cost of the moun tainous section crossing the Taurus. This may enable the German group to make some further progress with the line without further assist ance; but it would not, according to the best authorities, he sufficient to meet the great expense of the more difficult portions of the line, and eventually the participation of British capital is still likely to he desired.12 For the present, at all events, no formal pro posal is before His Majesty’s Government.

I HAVE the honour to inclose herewith to your Lordship a summary of the Convention which has been laid before the Imperial Government by the Anatolian Railwav Company settling the main points of the Bagdad Railway Concession. Ihe Convention has not been definitely accepted as yet, and as I have received the informa tion which I am able to give from a private channel, 1 beg that your Lordship will for the present consider it confidential. The clauses are carefully examined in a Memorandum by Mr. Weakley, Commercial Attache to this Embassy, which I have the honour likewise to transmit. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) N. R. O’CONOR. Inclosure 1. Summary of Convention respecting the Bagdad Railway Concession. THE following details of the negotiations recently entered into by the “ Societe du Chemin de Fer Ottoman d’Anatolie ” and the Ministry of Public Works, concerning the Concession of the Konia-Bagdad Railway, have come to hand. The Imperial Ottoman Government will concede to the “ Societe du Chemin de Fer Ottoman d’Anatolie ’ the Concession for the construction and the working of a railway line from Konia to Bagdad and Bussorah. The Concession is to have a duration of ninety-nine years from the date of issue of the Firman, and this duration is to apply to the whole railway system constructed and administered by the “ Societe du Chemin de Fer Ottoman d’Anatolie.” The line to be constructed is to be of 1*435 metres to 1*455 metres in breadth between the rails, and is to pass through or near the towns of Eregli, Adana, Hamidieh, Tei-Habesh, Harran, Ras-el-Ain, Halit, Nissibin, Tel-Avenat, Mossoul, Tekrit, Sadidjeh, Bagdad, Kerbela, Nedjef, Zobeir, and Bussorah, and will have the following branch lines :— 1. From Hamidieh to the port of Castaboli. 2. From Tel-Habesh to Aleppo. 3. From a point on the main line to be determined upon to Urfa. 4. From Sadidjeh to Hannekin. 5. From Zobeir to the port of Kazima.* 6 . From Kazima to Koweit. Should the Imperial Government at any time decide upon the construction of a railway or tramway line between the town of Aleppo and a point on the coast, the Concession for this line is to be ceded to the “ Societe,” who will also enjoy preferential rights for the construction and working of branch lines to Marash, Aintab, Biredjik, Mardin, Erbil, from Diala to Salahieh and Turkamatli, and from El-Badj to Hit. The “ Societe ” is authorized to establish and work a service of navigation, either steam or sail, on the Shatt-el-Arab as well as on the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers. This service is to be under the control of the Ministry of Marine, and the “ Societe” will be authorized to transport all the material necessary for the construction of the railway, as well as the employes and workmen engaged in the construction. This service of river navigation is to form part and parcel of the railway system, and it will enjoy the same immunities from customs duties and other taxes as aie granted to the railway. The “ Societe ” is authorized, within the limits of the Concession, to construct ports, quays, jetties with railways, sheds, stores, &amp;c., and will have the right of loading and dischaiging vessels. The expenditure entailed in the building and up-keep pf these different woiks is to be borne solely by the “ Societe,” who will have the right of recouping such outlay from toe revenue dorivGcl from flioso 'works The “Societe” will also have the right to construct ports at Castaboli, Bussorah, and Kazima, to erect the necessary plant for mooring phips alongside the quays, and oi ic discharging and loading of vessels, and to erect buildings for the storage of meichant ize. e * See “Persian Gulf Pilot,” p. 159, for “Kazima ” or “ Kdthama. Kathama is the name ^ a h avbo u r in Koweit Bay. It is west of Ras Asheirig. The south side has a west-south-west direction for o miles fiom that point; it shoals gradually from 7 fathoms at the entrance, which is 4 miles broad, towards the head. [1279] E14 plans of these ports, as well as the tariffs of the dues to he charged, must be submitted to the Ministry of Public Works within a maximum period of eight years, and the works must be terminated in twelve years’ time, dating from the time of signature of the Railway Convention. The ports are to form part of the railway system, and their net revenues are to be included in the total net revenues of the railway. On the expiration of the Railway Concession, these ports, with ail their plant and buildings, will revert to the Imperial Government. Should the “ Societe ” however, fail to build any one of these ports within the stipulated time, the Imperial Government reserves the right of granting the Concession for the construction of these ports to other parties. In any case, the Government will, during the construction of the railway, permit the “ Societe ” to erect plant and temporary buildings at these ports for the landing and storage of railway material, but, on the completion of the railway, the Government may demand the removal of all the plant and buildings. The Government is to take the necessary measures for the establishment of a proper and regular service of steam-boats to ply between Stamboul and Haidar-Pasha, and the “Mahsusse” Administration is to be called upon to provide three new steamers for this service, each vessel having a speed of 14 knots of 1,855 metres per knot. Should the “ Mahsusse ” Administration fail to carry out this arrangement within three months after the date of signature of the Railway Convention, the “ Societe ” will have the right of establishing this steam-boat service themselves, and will have full liberty to carry passengers and goods to and from Haidar-Pasha, Sirkedji, and the Karakeuy Bridge. This right will be exercised on the condition that the captains and crews of the steam-boats are pensioned officers and men of the Imperial Navy, or are selected from amongst the students of the Imperial Naval School, and are duly provided with certificates. These boats will do duty, and take the place of those belonging to the “ Mahsusse ” Administra tion, but will be exclusively used for the special service as already defined. The “Societe” undertakes to_ pay to the “ Mahsusse ” Administration a sum equal to 5 per cent, of the gross earnings of this service ; the boats are to be assimilated to those of the “ Mahsusse ” fleet, and will enjoy equal rights and privileges. The “ Societe ” is to be granted authorization to work all mines which may be found within a radius of 20 kilom. on either side of the railway, and which have not already been conceded to other parties; the “ Societe ” is also permitted to cut down any timber which may be required, from the forests found in the districts through which the line of railway is to pass. The “ Societe may build stores and sheds at any point on the line which may be deemed necessary, and can erect such buildings on the land forming the property of the railway. The use of these stores and sheds is to be optional to the public, and these buildings will become the property of the Government on the expiration of the Concession. Brick and tile factories may also be established by the “ Societe at any place along the line, and all the machinery and tools necessary for such factories will enter the country free of duty, and will, like railway material, be exempted from all taxation. The authorization for the use of electricity is also granted to the “ Societe,” and natural waterfalls and dams will be made use of, for generating electricity. The trains are to be lighted with the electric light as well as all establishments belonging to the railway. The plans and designs of these works and plant must be submitted for the approval of the Ministrv of Works. r J The Government undertakes, within two months’ time, to hand over to the “Societe,” according to the laws of expropriation, any lands, quarries, &amp;c., belonging to private individuals, which^ are necessaiy for the construction of the line, of stations, sheds, &amp;c., but which the Societc has been unable to acquire, owing to the impossibility of coming to terms with the pioprietois. Such Crown lands as the railway will pass through, or which may be necessary for the line, will be handed over to the “ Societe ” free of charge. During the course of construction of the railway, the “ Societe ” will have the free use of all quarries, &amp;c., which are found on any Crown lands situated within a radius of 5 kilom. on either side of the line. Should the “ Societe desire to continue the working of these quarries, &amp;c., after the completion of the railway, the laws regulating the working of quarries must be observed, and the taxes fixed by these laws must be paid. All the material, such as iron, wood, coal, machinery, &amp;c., necessary for the construction of the railway and its branches, w r hether purchased abroad or in Turkey, will be exempted from the payment of customs duty and all interior taxation. All the coal imported for the use of the railway will be peimitted to enter the country duty free. This exemption from duty r on the impoitation of coal will be enjoyed so long as the gross receipts of the railway lines ceded to tlic 6 feoci 6 t 6 do not ocpicil tB .6 sum of tlio kilomotnc guumntcc. 1 he Convention, as well as the “ Cahier des Charges,” is to be free of stamp duty, and all pnonty shares and debentures issued by the “ Societe ” are also to enjoy T that privilege. The piojected line is to be divided into ten sections of 200 kilom. each. The “Societe” is expected to submit full suiveys and plans of the first section of 200 Idiom, to the Ministry of Public Works, eight months after the date of the issue of the Firman granting the Concession. A delay of eight months is to be granted in each consecutive case, for the presentation of the plans and suiveys of each separate section, until the completion of the surveys of the w r hole line. Should the Gov eminent require certain changes and modifications in the plans and surveys which hav e been presented, provision is to be made for granting the “ Societe ” ample time for making new surveys, but it is stipulated that the Government must notify' its approval of the plans generally, three months after their presentation to the Department of Public Works.— 15 The commencement of the construction of the railway is to take place three montks^ after the date of the notification of the approval by the Government of the plans of the first section of 200 kilom., and the “ Societe” undertakes to complete the whole system in twelve years counting from the same date. Certain provisions are made in case of the stoppage, interruption, or suspension of the work of construction of the railway by circumstances of force majeure. This term is held to include such contingencies as European or Continental wars, as well as the fall of three points, m English, German, or French Government stock, below the market quotations of the day upon which the Convention is signed. Should the suspension of the works be brought about through any of these causes, the “ Societe ” will, on the resumption of the work, be granted an extra delay equal to the time of such suspension. Permission will be given for throwing open to traffic the sections of the railway which have passed Government inspection (“reception provisoire ) ; these sections must be at least 20 kilom. in length, and must terminate at a station. Besides a daily ordinary service of one train per day going each way, the “ Societe is expected and authorized to maintain an express train service between Haidar-Pasha and Bagdad, and an express train must be run once a week either way. In order to render this service possible, the Government undertakes to pay the “Societe” the sum of 1,000,000 fr. as its contribution towards the relaying of the Haidar-Pasha section of the railway. The railway will, for the present, consist of a single line, but sufficient land must be acquired for the laying of a double line. This double line will be built at the expense of the “ Societe, ^ and its construction will be insisted upon by the Government when the gross traffic receipts o! the railway have attained the sum of 30,000 fr. per kilom. _ . . New capital will have to be raised for the construction of the contemplated lines, and it^ is understood that the share and debenture holders of the existing lines (Haidar-Pasha-Eskishenr, Eskishehr-Angora, Eskishehr-Konia) cannot be called upon without their consent|to participate in the new enterprise, and that their acquired rights remain intact. In ^making the necessaiy arrangements for the construction and working of the new lines, the “ Societe undertakes to provide for the protection of the interests of these shareholders, and Avill create a distinctly separate Administration for the new railway system from Konia to Bagdad.^ ^ As a guarantee of the execution of all engagements, the “ Societe will^ deposit .he sum of £ T. 30,000 in a bank to be indicated by the Government. This caution-money is to be deposited on the day of issue of the Firman, and may be made either in cash or m Ottoman stock* The withdrawal of this deposit can only be effected after the official reception of the first section of 200 kilom. of railway, and a similar sum must be deposited for every subsequent section under construction. That is to say, every section is to be considered as an independent unit of the whole line, the deposit of £ T. 30,000 being only made on account of one section at a time so that the Government can, at no period of the construction, demand the deposit of a sum greater than the caution-money agreed upon for one single section. , , The Government retains the right of purchasing the whole system constructed and administered by the “ Soci 6 t 6 du Chemin de Fer Ottoman d’Anatolie ” at any period after the first thirty years of the Concession. The purchase is to be effected by the Government by means of an annual payment equal to 50 per cent, of the average gross receipts of the five years previous to the date of purchase, such payments being conditional on the receipts of those years averaging not less than 14,000 fr. per kilom. The Government will, by a special Convention with the “ Societe,” undertake to make the necessary arrangements for insuring the regular payments of the purchase g Uaran t e es the “ Societe ” an annual net revenue of 13,000 fr. per kilom. constructed and opened to traffic. The working expenses of the mam line and its branches are estimated at 50 per cent, of the annual gross receipts as a maximum, and at 4,500 kiiom. per annum as the minimum figure. Should the traffic receipts per kilom. e guaranteed amount, the Government undertakes to make up the deficiency. For this purpose the tithe revenues of certain sanjaks, to be determined upon by mutual agreement will be handed over to the Public Debt Administration for collection. The deficiency m net tiaffic receipts will be made up to the guaranteed figure from these revenues. All tithe levenues pledged in this manner for the whole line, or which may eventually be set aside for the guaiantees If any extensions and branches of the line, are to be considered m the aggregate as intended to insure the regular payment of the kilometric guarantees granted to the S oc .ete. I fie « Societe ” will, &amp; however, receive no kilometric guarantee for the branch hue to be built between Kazima and Koweit. This line is to be 30 kilom. in length ; it is to be built at the expense of the “ Societe,” and the gross receipts of the line from all sources will belong to the Societe €XCl A^elch section of the railway is opened to traffic, the receipts of all the working sections must be taken as one whole, in order to be able to strike an ave ^ e f ^ The formalities involved in the designation, by mutual agreement of the sanjafis, tne titne revenues of which are to be assigned to the service of the kilometric guarantees, must be cone u e collect “these revenues must als^o be communicated to the “Somete” wrthm the samepenod. Should these two stipulations be not complied with within the time authorized to consider itself entirely freed from all the engagements it Convention. The “Societe” will then have the right to withdraw -P T 30 000 without anv formality or the consent of the Government. Thr‘‘SocLtT”S as far as the circumstances permit, give employment by preference within the same period, fixed, the “Societe” is had undertaken in the the caution-money ofir 16 to Ottoman subjects ; ten years after the opening of the railway all the personnel employed with the exception of the heads of departments, must exclusively be of Ottoman nationality. Constantinople. November 4, 1901. Inclosure 2 . Memorandum by Mr. Weakley. -*-1 b e remembered, the Anatolian Kail way Company obtained in the latter part of 1898 the final confirmation of the preferential rights which had been previously conferred on them in the Convention of the Ismidt-Angora Railway to the Concession of the Bagdad Railway and to which was added Bussorah and Koweit, after the unsuccessful efforts made by Mr. Rechnitzer to obtain the same Concession for a London Syndicate. The technical Commission, which was appointed by the Anatolian Railway Company for the drawing up of the preliminary surveys, and to study the economic possibilities of the districts Jirough which the railway would pass, left Constantinople in the autumn of 1899, and terminated its labours m March of the following year. Copies of the Reports drawn up by that Commission have been obtained, and we are in possession of the views held by that Commission as to the present state of the country the advantages which it would reap from the construction of the contemplated line, and the benefits which capitalists might expect, under the most advantageous circumstances, in the event of their participation m the enterprise. ,, 1 he Ti^Ron which has been lying dormant for nearly a year has been revived, and about _ e month of September last negotiations were reopened with the Turkish Government for drawing up the Convention of the projected railway. The Company had, it appears decided upon making a point on the lower reaches of the Shatt-el-Arab, near Fao, the terminus of the firm m preference to Koweit, and it is supposed that this alteration of the original plan was due to the questioned right of sovereignty of the Turkish Government over Koweit and district It is t0 an i a ? Peal ma f e the Sultan t0 Berlir b fhe Company has reconsidered • .i foimer decision, and has notified the Ministry of Public Works that Koweit will be mcjuded in the railway scheme, and will form one of the termini of the line on the Persian W i Xe F 0 t !f tl0nS h , ave hee r 7 QVy activeI y conducted both at the Palace and at the Ministry of P ? 1 lks ^ the conclusion of the new Convention, Dr. Zander, one of the Directors of the Anatofian Radway, having been the chief negotiator on behalf of the Company.

It is especially stipulated that the branch line from -hazima or Kathama (a point on the Bay of Koweit) to Koweit itself, a line of about 30 kiloni. in length, will not, however, enjoy any guaranteed revenue. The woiking expenses of the whole line are to be fixed at 50 per cent, of the gross traffic leceipts as a maximum expenditure, and 4,500 fr. per kilom. as the minimum. Ihe Concession is to comprise the enjoyment of privileges of a most exceptional and extensive character, the most important of which are : 1 . Preferential rights for the construction of branch lines of secondary importance. 2 . 1 he building of ports at Castaboli, Bussorah, and Kazima, and the right of levying port and quay dues on merchandize. 3. The right to work all mines found within a radius of 20 kilom. on either side of the railway, and which may not have been otherwise conceded. 4. 1 he establishment of a steam-boat service for the carrying of passengers and merchandize to and from Stamboul and Haidar-Pasha, and which will replace the service now undertaken by the “ Mahsusse ” Administration. 5. 4 he liberty to establish a service of steam or sail on the Shatt-el-Arab, the Tigris, and the Euphrates. It is to be presumed that the “ Hamidie ” service of boats now run on the Shatt- el-Arab and iigris by the Turkish Government will be made over to the German Company, who will enjoy all the rights and privileges granted to the “ Hamidie” Administration. It is difficult to believe that when the draft of this Convention is submitted to the Council of Ministers it Avill be accepted without very serious modifications, for the scheme, as it at present stands, practically means the handing over to the German Company and its supporters the future development, in the fullest sense, of the immense tract of country through which it is intended to carry the railway. Constantinople, November 12, 1901. APPENDIX II. Bagdad Railway Convention, signed at Constantinople, January 21, 1902. ENTRE son Excellence Zihni Pacha, Ministre du Commerce et des Travaux Publics, agissant au nom du Gouvernement Imperial, d’une part; et M. le Dr. Kurt Zander, President, et M. E. Huguenin, Vice-President de la Direction du Chemin de Fer Ottoman d’Anatolie, agissant au nom et pour compte de la Societe du Chemin de Fer Ottoman d’Anatolie a Constantinople, d’autre part; il a etc arrete ce qui suit:— ARTICLE I er .

De Tel-Habesh a Alep. 2. D’un point rapproche de la ligne principale a determiner d’un commun accord a Urfah, la Societe ne jouira d’aucune garantie kilometrique de la part du Gouvernement Imperial du chef de la construction et de 1’exploitation de cet embranchement d’une longueur de 30 kilom. environ, mais les recettes brutes de toute nature de 1 embranchement appartiendront exclusive- ment k la Soci 6 te. 3. De Sadidjeh a Hannekin. 4 . De Zobeir a un point du Golfe Persique a determiner d’un commun accord entre le Gouvernement Imperial Ottoman et la Societe, et en suivant un trace qui sera approuve par le Gouvernement Imperial, ainsi que de toutes les dependances des dites lignes a la Societe du Chemin de Fer Ottoman d’Anatolie, aux conditions suivantes: ARTICLE II. La duree de cette Concession sera de quatre-vingt-dix-neuf annees, a partir de la^ date de la remise du Firman et 1’echange de la presente Convention ; et cette duree de Concession s appliquera egalement aux lignes d’Angora et de Konia. [1279] Fof the most unprofitable and comparatively expensive sections (Tel-Habesh to Mossoul ?) which the Company might otherwise find it to its interest to abandon. Articles XXX, XXXI, and XXXII concern the Post and Telegraph services of the railway, which are to be submitted to a strict Government control. Article XXXIII authorizes the Company to establish a steam-boat service between Haidar- Pasha, Sirkedjh and the Kara Keuy Bridge for the transport of passengers and merchandize. This authorization will be exercised by the Company in the event of the “Mahsousse” Adminis tration failing to organize, within three years after the signature of the Convention, this special service on the line indicated by the Government. Article XXXV fixes the annuity to be paid by the Government to the Company at 12.000 fr. per kilometre of railway completed and opened to traffic. A further sum per annum of 4,500 fr. per kilometre is also to be paid to the Company on account of traffic working expenses. It is stipulated that the Government is to receive all surpluses of gross traffic receipts above the sum of 4,500 fr., but not exceeding 10,000 fr. The surplus of gross receipts over 10,000 fr. are to be divided between the Government and the Company in the proportion of 60 per cent, and 40 per cent, respectivelv, and such sums as the Government will receive on this account are to be placed to the credit of the annuity account. The revenues which are to be set aside for the payment of the annuity, and the sum fixed for the working expenses of the railway, have not been designated; a provision in the Article specially stipulates that the Convention will only become operative when a decision on this question has been arrived at. Article XXXVII.—The Company undertakes to strengthen the whole of the present system of Haidar-Pasha-Angora and Eskishehr—Konia, and to introduce the necessary improvements so as to permit the running of an express train service. The expenditure for these improvements is fixed at 8,000,000 fr., for which the Government will pay the Company an annual sum of 350.000 fr. for thirty years on account of interest and sinking fund. The Government also undertakes to pay the Company an annual subsidy of 350,000 fr. for the express train service. The service of express trains will only be introduced on the line when the railway has reached Aleppo.

Sir iV. O'Conor to the Marquess of Lansdowne.—(Received October 23.) (No. 709. Confidential.) Mv Lord, Therapia, October 14, 1905. I HAVE the honour to acknowledge your Lordship’s despatch No. 317 of the 26th ultimo, inclosing a Memorandum by Consul-General Schwabacb, who is a Director of the Bagdad Railway Company. In view of Mr. Schwabach’s statements ( 1 ) that he considers the figure of £00,000/. as the estimate of the profit on the construction of the Konia-Eregli section as “ absolutely fantastic,” and ( 2 ) that he presumes that whatever profits were made will be finally divided by the Construction Company, it would be as well to review the actual financial arrangements of the Bagdad Railway Company. The Bagdad Railway Company started with a nominal capital of 600,000/. Only half of tins was subscribed. The detail of the subscription is as follows:— BAGDAD RAILWAY. CONFIDENTIAL,, Per Cent. By the Imperial Ottoman Government „ Anatolian Railway Company „ Deutsche Bank group .. 10 10 SO It is suggested that the 20 per cent, found by the Anatolian Railway Company and Imperial Ottoman Government is only a nominal subscription, and was perhaps never reallv paid up ; at any rate, the Deutsche Bank group provided 240,000/. It is remarkable that the Bagdad Railway Company’s balance-sheet shows a loan of £ T. 200,000, or 181,818/., to the Imperial Treasury—an advance which swallows up the bulk of the paid-up capital. This loan is said to have facilitated the Krupp 1)1^2111 SO, C t) 1 Oil • To defray the actual cost of the construction of the line, an Ottoman Government loan of 2,160,000/. was issued at 4 per cent. The interest on this loan is secured by the 88,000/. paid by the Turkish Government to the Bagdad Railway Company in kilometric guarantee on the Konia-Eregli section. i i Of this loan, 128.660/. nominal worth of bonds were kept back by _the Bagdad Railway Company, and about 2 , 000 , 000 /. were issued by public subscription at the price of 86-30, thus realizing 1,726,000/., or, at the price of 80 per cent. (Consul- General Schwabach’s figure), 1,520,000/. to the Bagdad Railway Company the difference between the two sums being possibly the commission and expenses ol the issue • This money was issued by the Bagdad Railway Company to construct the Koma- It is important to note that the bondholders who provide the capital, and are secured by the kilometric guarantee provided by the Imperial Ottoman Governmen , have no risk or stake in the actual success or non-success of the line, _ save tha ei bonds are secured by a mortgage on the section and rollmg-stock which their money iaS As'reSds the actual construction of the line, the Bagdad Railway Company, having obtained the money from the loan, employed a Construction Company o eairy out the work, which the latter performed at a cost to the Bagdad Railway ompany (a, per Bagdad Railway Company’s balance-sheet) of 1,953 395/. This sum however, is only a nominal worth of bonds, and, therefore, as Consul-General ’ 20 per cent, must be deducted from it, as it includes discount, leaving 1 , , •&gt; 7,814/. per kilom. [2217 s—l] 0When the section was completed the Construction Company was wound up, and, as Mr. Schwabach says, the profit will be divided a year after the dissolution of the ^^Ifiiere* however, two points to which I would draw attention: 7,814Z. per kilom is an inflated price, and it is well known in Constantinople that 3,500/. is nearer the mark; secondly, there is little doubt that the Construction Company and the Ba o&gt; dad Bailway Company are one, and consequently a division of profits among the former will probably amount to an addition to the capital of the latter, the object in employing a dummy Construction Company being precisely to conceal from the public and the Ottoman Government the large sum laid aside from the profits on the Bonia-Eregli section for further construction. That that sum has been laid aside, and that it amounts to close on 800,000/., I have on an authority which I do not question. As Mr. Schwabach is not only a Consul-General, but also a .Director of the Bagdad Bailway Company, and as we have obtained some of the foregoing information from the Ottoman Bank—another interested party—it would not appear desirable to show him this despatch.

This seems to me such an interesting and valuable document that I venture to submit the accompanying remarks regarding portions of it, in the hope that they may be of some slight assistance to the compiler of the memorandum. THE BAGHDAD RAILWAY. Notes on the Board of Trade's Memorandum, dated 23rd June 1905. Paragraph 27 of that memorandum. —River-borne traffic will always he cheaper than rail-borne traffic, and it seems doubtful whether the railway will ever be able to compete with the river. The Turks, i.e., the Saniya administration, do contemplate extending the \ river service in the near future as far north as Mosul, and I have been in formed, by the working manager of the local Saniya administration, as also by the chief of the staff of the Vlth Army Corps, that it is intended to spend £ 75,000 T. on the improvement of the river between Baghdad and Mosul. I have seen this portion of the river at its best and at its worst, in the month of April when the water is at its highest, and also in the season of low water, and I am of opinion that, even with a much larger expenditure than £ 75,000 T. this portion of the river will not be navigable for more than four or five months in the year, and then only for vessels of a draught not exceeding SO' to 36'. During the remainder of the year, the vessels employed on this service will be unable to ply above Tikrit and perhaps not higher up than Samarra. The downward journey will always be quite easy for rafts, which are now largely employed, but the rafts cannot get back again and are sold at the end of the downward journey for the value of the wood of which they are composed.

THE Director of Military Operations presents his compliments to the Under secretary of State for Toreign Affairs, and begs to forward for his information the Report and sketches compiled by Captain E. W. S. Mahon, R.E., who was dispatched to examine the country adjacent to the Khor Abdullah at the head of the Persian Gulf, with a view to reporting on the places which appeared most suitable as termini of the proposed Bagdad Railway, in accordance with conclusion 1 of the sixty- seventh meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence, held in London on the 22nd March, 1905. 2 . Major-General Grierson would be pleased if he could be informed whether there is any objection to a copy of this Report being furnished to the Intelligence Branch of the Indian army, and should the report be printed he would be glad to be furnished with six copies. Winchester House, St. James’s Square, London, July 29, 1905. Inclosure in No. 1 . Report {with Maps) on the country adjacent to the Khor Abdullah, and places suitable as Termini of proposed Bagdad Railway, by Captain E. W. S. Mahon, R.E. July 1905. (Secret.) THE terminus of the Bagdad Railway could be made at either of the following places :— 1. Bussorah. 2. Eao. 3. Um-Kasr. 4. Warba Island. 5. Koweit. (a.) El-Kathama; (b.) Bander-es-Shuwaik. There are no insuperable difficulties to be met with in reaching any of these places, and the cost of construction per mile (exclusive of permanent way) would be comparatively slight. There is thus no technical objection to any of the above places becoming the terminus of the railway, I propose to discuss the merits of each. Bussorah, situated up the Shatt-el-Arab, about 67 miles from the bar, is tile present distributing centre of trade for Eastern Turkish Arabia, and is likely to remain so. It is the limit of navigation for sea-going vessels. [937] BThe great hindrance to Eussorah commercially is the bar of the Shatt-el-Arab, which, in its present condition, is only available for the passage of vessels of 15-foot draught at ordinary high tides and of 18 feet at “ high springs.” I attach a plan of the bar copied from a survey made recently by Mr. Burgess, chief officer of the British India Steam Navigation Company, from which it can be seen that, with a very little dredging, the channel could be made available for vessels drawing 24 feet at high springs. The length of shallow water is at present but little over half-a-mile, and by com parison with previous charts it will be seen that the tendency is for the stream to cut a channel for itself through this shallow portion. If the channel were once cleared, very little assistance would be required to keep it so. * If this were done the chief drawback to Bussorah as a commercial port would be removed. Merchandize, both export and import, is at present carried between Bussorah and Bagdad by shallow river steamers and native craft. It is unlikely that this mode of transport would be in any way affected by the railway which, under ordinary circumstances, would be unable to compete successfully in the matter of rates. The majority of the passengers would, however, probably prefer the rapid train service to the slower journey by boat. Politically, Bussorah would, I consider, be badly situated as the terminus of the railway, as it is on Turkish territory, and therefore under Turkish control for Customs and other regulations. In the event of war between Turkey and the Power owning the terminus and dominating the trade, it would be, for topographical reasons, a very difficult place to defend. By seizing and holding the river channel the Turks could sever communi cation with the open sea, which their adversaries would not be able to re-establish without great difficulty. Fcto .—“There would be no technical difficulty in connecting Pao with Bussorah by rail. It is situated on the right bank of the Shatt-el-Arab, about 8 miles from the bar. The line would have to skirt the date plantations on the side away from the river (a 5-foot embankment would suffice) and come down to the river just north of the telegraph station. At this point there is deep water (7 fathoms) close in to the shore extending for over a mile. Land at the station side would be expensive as it is all date plantations, but there are no engineering difficulties to overcome. The objections, from a railway point of view, which apply to Bussorah, apply equally to Eao, with the added objection that there is at present no trade there, and it is extremely unlikely that firms already established at Bussorah would remove to Pao; all their interests and connections with the native traders are in the former town, and there would be no advantages to counteract the increased cost of transport between lao and Bussorah, which would be out of all proportion to the cost of transport between Bussorah and outside ports. Pao also is on Turkish territory (although the land is mostly owned by the Sheikh of Koweit), and therefore liable to the same restrictions and regulations as Bussorah. The trade of Mohammerah on the Persian side of the Shatt-el-Arab has also to be taken into consideration, as it is likely to increase considerably when the communi cation betw'een the upper Karun and the interior of Persia is improved as proposed. Steamers proceeding to Bussorah call at Mohammerah. The merchants of Mohammerah —a Persian port—-would never transfer their interest to a Turkish port at Pao, so that steamers would still call there. Fao’s one advantage over Bussorah is its proximity to the sea ; communication with it could be more easily maintained in the event of trouble. Um-Kasr is the name of a small creek at the head of the Khor Abdullah. It is claimed by the Sheikh of Koweit, but the Turks have built a fort and maintain a small garrison about el miles up from the mouth of the creek. The creek is about 3 miles long by half a mile broad, narrowing at the end. At about a mile from the entrance on the west bank there is a narrow strip of land lying above high water. It is about 300 yards by 30 yards, and separated from the general high ground by about 400 yards of shallow swamp. The water is deep close in shore, and a landing stage could be easily erected along it and connectedto the high ground to the west, which could he made the site of the railway terminus. There would he no difficulty in bringing the alignment to this point from Zobeir by practically following the road. The chief advantages of Um-Kasr are that— 1 . It is accessible at all times to ships drawing 18 feet, and, by a little dredging at the east end of Warba Island, this could be improved so as to make it accessible to ships drawing 24 feet. 2. Ships can get close to shore and be unloaded direct. 3. The creek is land-locked and protected from storms. The objections are— 1 . The available combination of deep water and dry shore only extend for a short distance, about 300 yards, and considerable dredging and banking operations would have to be undertaken to improve it. 2. The creek is narrow, and would only accommodate a limited number of ships of any size. 3. Bussorah would still remain the trade centre. As noted above, the railway is unlikely to be able to compete successfully with the river traffic between Bagdad and Bussorah, and it would be considerably cheaper to ship goods direct at Bussorah than to rail them to Um-Kasr before doing so. . There still remains the merchandize from above Bagdad which may be caught by the railway. If this was still carried by the railway to Bussorah it would probably be unloaded there in preference to incurring the extra railway freights to Um-Kasr. I have no information as to the amount of trade to be expected from above Bagdad. 4 . There are no habitations at Um-Kasr and no business connections, so that it is unlikely to become a port of any size. 5 . Special arrangements would have to be made for the protection of the port against raids. Warba Island is situated in the Khor Abdullah to the south-east of the Khor Um- Kasr. It is separated from the western mainland by the Khor foalem, a narrow creek 100 yards broad at the north end, widening with swamps to three-quarters of a-mile at high w r ater at the south end. _ n ^ The Khor Abdullah to the south of Warba Island would afford a fine anchorage for a large number of ships, and is accessible to ships of 24 feet at am time; it is land-locked and well protected from storms. . The ground at the south-west corner of the island slopes steeply and there is deep water close in shore. , , _ The island is flat and sandy with low~ scrubby bushes, die general level is about 10 feet above high water, hard and dry. There is probably no fresh water obtainable, but brackish water should be found near the surface. The railway could be continued from Um-Kasr along near the shore skirting tie high ground, cross the Khor Salem at its north end, and continue on to the south west corner of the island; the only obstacle is the crossing of the Khor halem winch could be effected with girders supported on screw piles. , Warba Island would be a better position for a railway terminus than Um-Kasr, as the anchorage is larger and the firm ground broad and continuous along the shore There is plenty of room for building: all materials would ham to be biou^ht to 6 All the objections on the score of trade applicable to Um-Kasr apply equally to Warba Island, and the trade of Bussorah is not likely to be transferred to this poit The difficulty of fresh water could he overcome by the use oi condensing machine^ &gt; * * th. Slieikli o, gj-yg it would be possible to ensure that no unnecessary restrictions and Regulations should be l n! ' 0 kfeTomtry 0 bordering the Khor Abdullah is low and swampy so that^a hostile force could not effectively command the approaches to these P° r s - * a ' ,i&lt; would be more secure against raids than Um-Kasr. [937]4 Koweit. There are two points on the shore of Koweit Harbour which are available as possible sites for the terminus of the railway, Hz. : 1 . El Kathama. 2 . Bandar-es-Shu wait. El Kathama is the name of the shore and anchorage at the west end of the harbour; the anchorage is capable of accommodating a large number of ships of 24 feet draught. There is no deep water close in shore, and cargo would have to he transhipped by means of lighters, unless a pier of about half a-mile is built out into the harbour. The anchorage is well sheltered from the 44 Shamal,” or north wind. The shore consists of firm salty sand, sloping up towards the hills bordering the north side of the harbour. These hills terminate in abruptly broken sandstone cliffs, 300 feet to 400 feet high, which extend for several miles along the north shore. A good site for a station could be found on the slope below the cliffs. Owing to the broken and irregular nature of the cliff's it would be extremely difficult, if not impracticable, to find an alignment to climb them ; and the approach to El Kathama must be along the slope on the north shore. In order to effect this, the alignment from Zobeir would skirt the high ground past TJm-Kasr and follow down to the west of the Khor Sabiya (which^ separates Buhiyan Island from the mainland) and turn round on to the northern side of the harbour; this would all be easy going, practically a surface line throughout, and no engineering difficulties to overcome. The chief objection to El Kathama as a railway terminus lies in the fact that, as with Um-Kasr and Warba Island, there is no trade existing there, and would stand a still smaller chance of competing with Bussorah owing to the increased lead. It is too far (19 miles) by road from Koweit to derive any benefit from the proximity of that town, and special arrangements would have to be made for the protection of the port against raids. Bandar-es-Shuwailt is a creek to the south-west of the town of Koweit, formed oy the mainland on the east side, Kurein Island and the mud flat on the western side. It is about 14 sea miles long by 4 cables broad, and has a depth of 36 feet throughout, except at the entrance, where it has a depth of 12 feet low-water springs, with a rise of 12 feet, giving at least depth of 24 feet at high-water springs. This could probably be much improved by dredging. Inside of 12 feet right round Kow r eit, the bottom consists of a layer of rock overlying sand, the rock being limestone with coral formation ; the rest of the bottom is mud and sand. About 1 mile of the far end of the creek could be utilized for ships as it at present exists, by merely placing mooring posts on both sides of the creek ; those to the east being intended to moor ships alongside the bank (as there is deep water right close up to it) and those on the mud bank to the west for warping ships in and out, Eurther improvements could be added as required, but the entrance to the creek should he carefully buoyed for the deepest channels. The shore at this point is admirably adapted for a railway terminus ; it slopes gradually to a flat plain 2D to 30 feet above high sea level; the soil is firm sand. Erom El Kathama the alignment would pass Jehara and follow the road to Koweit. There are no engineering difficulties to overcome. As in the other instances, a railway at Koweit would have no effect on the trade of Bussorah. There is, however, at present a certain amount of trade between Koweit and the interior, and also between Bagdad and the interior direct; the railway between Bagdad and Koweit would considerably shorten the route and would probably catch most of the trade diverting it through Koweit. The interior of Arabia is reported to be a richly cultivated country, which would probably repay opening up, and if it should in the future be decided to do this, Koweit would be the nearest point on the Persian Gulf to start from. With proper communications trade would increase and, moreover, the trade between the interior and the Bed Sea would probably be diverted to the Persian Gulf if increased facilities were given. A railway at Koweit would probably catch the major portion of the outside pilgrim traffic to Kerbela, and a continuation to the interior would reap the benefit of a fast pilgrim route to Mecca.-;r mmim —-p-j 5 The town itself would inevitably expand enormously under these influences Agencies would be more readily established in a town than in an uninhabited spot like Um-Kasr or Warba Island, and the town would provide the accommodation necessary for native passengers. Owing to the proximity of the town the terminus could be easily protected from raids. As the port would be under British protection it would remain an open port, and be free from unnecessary regulations and restrictions. Fresh water could be obtained by condensing machinery. The entrance to the harbour should be lighted with the following lights : 15 mile light, south-east end of Failaka Island, 15 mile light on Ras-el-Arz, 7 mile light on Ras-el-Ajuza, to enable the harbour to be entered at night. Conclusion. (a.) From an engineering point of view Warba Island is the best position for a railway terminus and port. I would place Um-Kasr next, and Fao third, with Koweit (Bandar-es-Shuwaik) fourth. There are no engineering difficulties to prevent Bussorah being made a terminus. Land along the river front would be expensive and ships cannot come close in shore, so that transhipment w r ould have to be by lighters as at present. (b.) As regards trade Bussorah is undoubtedly the best position for the terminus, as it is the terminus of sea-going vessels and is capable of improvement. Any line beyond Bussorah to the Gulf would be practically a branch line; and after Bussorah, Koweit is the only place where any trade could be expected, at least for several years. The Power holding Bussorah as a port, would control the trade of north-east Arabia which is at present almost entirely British. (Signed) E. W. S. MAHON. July 24, 1905. oDate. Initials. SUBJECT.

BAGDAD RAILWAY. [July 2S.] CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. No. 1 . Memorandum by Sir T. Sanderson. (Confidential.) MR. BARRY, Director of the London Branch of the Imperial Ottoman Bank, called this afternoon and told me that the Paris branch of the Bank had again been approached by an agent of Dr. Gwinner on the subject of the Bagdad Railway. The statement made by Dr. Gwinner’s agent appears to haye been that the participation of British capital in the Railway had already been decided upon in principle by means of communications with Sir Nicholas O’Conor, that the construction of the Bagdad- Bussorah section of the line was to be assigned to the British group, that Lord Lansdowne had had a conversation with M. Cambon on the subject, and that in view of the present entente between the two countries the Drench Government were ready to consent to this and to the participation of Drench capital, that the joint share of England and Drance was to he equal to that assigned to Germany and other countries— Austria-Hungary, Italy, &amp;c.,—that Messrs. Speyer and Co., of London, were to be charged with the formation of the English group, and that Dr. Gwinner hoped that the Imperial Ottoman Bank at Paris would head the Drench group. Mr. Barry’s object in calling was to ascertain what foundation there was for all these statements and to suggest that the Ottoman Bank in London was better fitted to head the British group than Messrs. Speyer. I thanked Mr. Barry and told him that the statement went far beyond anything that was known to me. There had been indications at Constantinople that the Germans were again desirous of interesting British capital in the Railway, and might not be unwilling to leave to the British group the Bagdad-Bussorah section of the line. Lord Lansdowne had told Sir N. O’Conor that he should be glad to know how- far this was the case, and what terms the German group were likely to offer or accept. He had also mentioned the matter in a general way some days ago to M. Cambon, who was entirely without instructions and seemed rather doubtful what view would he taken by his Government of any special arrangement with regard to the Bagdad- Bussorah section. He had not heard Messrs. Speyer’s name mentioned in connection with the matter. I told Mr. Barry that I mentioned all this to him in confidence, and I should be greatly obliged if he' would let me know of any further developments. T. H. S. Foreign Office, July 28, 1905. Dr. Gwinner and his friends are apparently well provided with information, which loses nothing in transmission to them. But the whole story suggests that the German group are very anxious for our support. Foreign Office, July 28, 1905. [2092 ee —1]W MBHWF lw TTfffHJBWIIHBnnBI 'onfidential.

I have, &amp;c. (Signed) J. B. WHITEHEAD. Inclosure in No. 1 . Extract from the u Kolonial Zeitung' of July 15, 1905. The Economic Development of the Euphrates and Tigris Valleys. (Translation.) IT Avas recently reported from Constantinople that Sir William Willcocks had submitted to the Sultan an elaborate plan for the irrigation of the Vilayets of Bagdad and Bussorah. The first point of this project is the reconstruction of the Nahrewan Canal, which existed at the time of the Abbasidian Ivhalifs and fell into decay at the end of the middle ages. Apart from this a number of smaller canals are to be drawn from the Tigris in order to irrigate the districts north-east of Bagdad ; and to the south of that city, down to Bussorah, besides the system of the ancient canal, large irrigation works are to be called into existence. As the Avater supply for this proposed system of canals Avould be taken from the Tigris, the latter would become too shallow for navigation; but on the other hand Sir William expects that the execution of this scheme would result in a great extension of the now inconsiderable cultivation of cotton, and in an extraordinary increase in the production of cereals, dates, and tobacco, in the very fertile regions which his project of irrigation Avould render available. In connection AAuth this far-sighted plan, the economic importance of Avhich cannot be denied, fears have been expressed in the public press that the construction of the portion of the Bagdad Railway between Bagdad and Bussorah may thereby pass into English hands, and that the political prestige of Germany in the Ottoman Empire Awmld, consequently, suffer a severe bloAV. There appears to be no real foundation for such fears. Sir William is, doubtless, an able and energetic man, Avho has done excellent Avork in Egypt in the matter of irrigation, and who Avill try to realize his project with great perseverance. ■ It must not be forgotten, however, that in the Valley of the Nile he was dealing with a country in which peace and order Avere guaranteed by the British Administration, whereas no such guarantee for their maintenance exists in the Turkish provinces on the Persian Gulf. Fertile though these districts once were, they are now practically a desert, and are so sparsely populated that the question must necessarily arise Avhere the human beings are to come from who should cultivate the lands Avhich the irrigation works would fertilize. It, therefore, seems to be almost out of the question that Sir W. Willcocks’ scheme should be taken in hand before the Bagdad Railway, a valid Concession for the continuation of Avhich to the shores of the Persian Gulf is held by the Anatolian Railway Company, has reached those districts. This undertaking, in which German capital participates in a predominating degree, forms as it were the presupposition for [2092 y— 1 ]the execution of the British project. There is no confirmation of the rumour that the Sublime Porte has already granted a Concession for the latter, and although negotia tions on the subject have been going on for more than two yeais, the day is still far off when a Firman will be obtained. It is a matter of common experience that agreements with the Turkish Government for economic undertakings require years of neo-otiation and hard work, and it is not probable that a Concession will be obtained in this case before the Bagdad Railway has been completed, especially as it is not consonant with the principles upon which the Sultan has hitheito m\ ailably acted, to allow undertakings to be started in districts which cannot be easily reached and controlled from Constantinople. If, however, Sir W. Willcocks’ scheme is some day really carried out, this could only be a source of satisfaction to the Bagdad Railway Company, who would thereby gain passengers and freights. The common interests of the international groups of capitalists who carry out the construction of the railway and the irrigation works are so obvious that it will, doubtless, be possible, at the proper moment, to arrive at an understanding. The endeavours of Germany are not directed, either in Turkey or elsewhere, towards the exclusion of the well-founded economic interests of the nations, nor does she desire to close the doors, which she wishes opened for herself, against the British or any other of her neighbours.11 ^ 'll'MU » l «group;; 'Hrrorl;^ arrive^ i hki p r ?^&lt; '■. ■' %l ^) 2 -y — 2 [This Documen t is the Property of His Br^nnic Majesty’s Government!

DLLUALLL, a menioei oi the Committee of the Chamber on Foreign Relations, called upon me to-da\, and expiessed in the strongest terms the desire of himself and his friends to maintain a good understanding with this country, and to co~operate with us in different parts of the world. He said, amongst other things :— 1 . lhat he considered it most desirable that, as soon as peace was concluded between Russia and Japan, France, England, the Lnited States, and the Netherlands should come to an agreement to guarantee the preservation of the status quo in the Far East. France, he said, had a special interest in this question owing to the position of her Indo-Chinese possessions. 2 . He thought v r e should work together in Siam. The Siamese Government had lately shown considerable signs of an activity which might become inconvenient, and we were in a position to give them good advice. I gathered that his idea vras that we should, m exchange for concessions elsewhere, give France a certain preponderance even in the valley of the Menam. 3. France^ and England ought to act together in regard to the Bagdad Railway, which was again coming to the front. We should first make up our minds as to the line which we intended to adopt, and then impose conditions upon Germany. 4. We ought to make it clear that w r e had no intention of interfering in Arabia, or of tolerating the interference of others in that country. 5. It was a question whether we should not reconsider the bases of the Agreement winch we w r ere on the point of concluding with France and Italy as to Abyssinia. It w^as clear to me that M. Deloncle was apprehensive of German interference in the event of the Agreement being proceeded with in its present form. He thought that all that was necessary was that we should come to an arrangement with regard to the railway upon the basis of the internationalization of the line. I observed that I had always been in favour of this, but that I had been given to understand that public opinion in France w r as strongly opposed to internationalization, although I was aware that the French Chambers of Commerce had pronounced themselves in favour of it. M. Deloncle said that the real opponent of internationalization was M. Delcasse, who had sought to impose his own views both upon the French Chamber and upon us. M. Delcasse’s object was to obtain the construction of what would be universally regarded as a French line to Adis Abeba, and to point to that achievement as one which completely effaced the Fashoda incident. M. Deloncle expressed himself in friendly terms as to Sir J. Harrington. C. We had some conversation as to the New Hebrides, but he made no special suggestion as to this, merely observing that Colonial opinion was much less excited than it had been upon this subject, and that he doubted whether proposals for partition would now encounter as much opposition as they would at one time have met with.

I HAA E the honour to inclose herewith a copy of the annual Report and financial Statement of the Societe Imperiale Ottomane du Chemin de Fer de Bagdad for the year ending the 31st December, 1904,* which has been recently published by that Administration. The building of the first 200-kilom. section of this line, from Konia to Boulgourlu, was finished in October 1904, and the line was officially thrown open to traffic on the 25th October of that year. It has not been considered advisable at present, in view of the short length of line, to create a separate Administration for the working of the railway, and it has been found more advantageous to conclude arrangements with the Anatolian Railway Company for the administration of this section. The arrangements which have been made with this Company will expire on the 31st December, 1907, but they will continue to be in operation every year after that date, and will cease one year after the date upon which notification may have been made by either side of the intention to terminate the effect of: such agreements. Among the items which appear in the financial Statement is the sum which has been expended in the construction of the first section of 200 kilom., and which amounts to 48,834,881 fr. 91 c., or 1,953,395/. This is equal to 217,406 fr. per kilometre, or about 14,000/. per mile. Article XXXV of the Bagdad Railway Convention, in defining the financial arrangements concluded between the Imperial Government and the Company, states that the Company has a right to the nominal sum of 269,110 fr. 65 c. for every kilometre of railway built, so that the cost of construction of the first section is well within the limits of the amount specified in the Convention. The rolling-stock of the railway is valued at 771,637 fr. 45 c., or 30,864/., and the following new material was ordered during the year :— 10 locomotives with tenders, 12 passenger carriages, 2 Post Office vans, 4 ordinary vans, 1 restaurant car, 171 freight waggons, and 2 snow ploughs. The gross traffic receipts derived from the working of the line from the day it was first opened to traffic, i.e.&lt; the 25th October, 1904, to the 31st December of the same year, amounted to 69,417 fr. 23 c., which is equivalent to a gross annual return of 1,868 fr. 14 c. per kilometre. Under the stipulations of Article XXXV of the Convention the Company receives the sum of 4,500 fr. per kilometre and per annum from the Turkish Government, in order [2092 aa — 1 ] * Not printed.2 to defray tire working expenses of tire line. Tire Company lias therefore received a sum of 97,359 fr. 96 c. from the Imperial Government, which, added to the traffic receipts, represents the total amount due for working expenses for the period as from the 25th October to the 31st December, 1904. The actual working expenses of the line which have been paid to the Anatolian Railway Administration under agreement for the sixty-eight days of the year (the 25th October to the 31st December, 1904), are found to be 40,503 fr. 4 c., that is, at the rate of about 1,087 fr. per kilometre and per annum. Administrative expenses figure at 18,090 fr. 91 c., or about 485 fr. 52 c. per annum. Iffie net profits for the year, which are almost entirely derived from interest amount to the sum of 783,117 fr. 84 c., and are to be distributed in the following- manner :— Fr. c.

It had been suggested that, should British financiers be ready to take the matter up, the Bagdad- Bussorah section might be undertaken by Great Britain. The matter was one which we should not like to deal with without previous consultation with the French Government. I asked his Excellency whether I was right in supposing that French financiers were at this moment connected with the project. His Excellency said that the French group had withdrawn in consequence of our withdrawal in 1903, and were at this moment as completely unconnected with it as we were. He also had heard reports that another attempt was to be made to bring us in. The idea of allowing this country to undertake the construction of the Bagdad-Bussorah section did not, however, seem to him a good one. Were such an arrangement to be made, it would be obvious that we had a “ visee politique ” in the matter. His own idea was that the concern should, if possible, be dealt with on a strictly international basis. BAGDAD RAILWAY. CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. [July 19.] No. 1. The Marquess of Lansdowne to Sir F.

I HAVE the honour to transmit to your Lordship herewith copy ot a despatch and some notes sent by Major Newmarch, British Resident at Bagdad, in connection with Captain Bigham’s Memorandum on the Bagdad Railway. It will be seen that Major Newmarch is of opinion that a steam-ship service to Mosul, although feasible, is not likely to be undertaken by the Turkish Company for some time. He also draws attention to the advantages of competition between Messrs. Lynch and the Saniya Company as compared with the virtual monopoly previously held by the former. Your Lordship will notice that Major Newmarch does not agree with Captain Bigham on the subject of the Bagdad-Khanakin branch, which he holds would not be unremunerative were it connected with Kerbela and Nejef. In a postscript to the notes on the Memorandum Major Newmarch informs me that a tramway has been proposed which w r ould connect Damascus with Bagdad; he has not yet obtained any particulars about the venture ; however, the inclosed sketch, :i: ' prepared by Mr. Mark Sykes, shows the bearing such a line would have on communications between Bagdad and the Syrian and North Mesopotamian towns.

Memorandum communicated by Board of Trade, June 23, 1905. THE accompanying Memorandum on the Bagdad Railway, prepared in this Denartment by Captain Bigham, summarizes very well the main features—commercial, financial, and political—of the project, and deals with the question of British partici- pahontherein^b^e evidence indicates that the Germans are likely to persevere with the scheme and finally to accomplish it, with or without our co-operation, and that tuey vmv be able to do*so even Without the raising of Turkish customs duties from o to 11 ner cent., in order to provide the necessary guarantee—a measure which would require the nssent of the Powers. On the other hand, it would probably he difficult to hud the necessary funds for the guarantee out ot the tithe revenues alone, and the financial difficulty is especially acute at the present time when the Germans are about to enter ™ the construction of the most costly and difficult part of the railway, involving the oflhT raums Mountains, if tUe Germans' are willing to give us good terms m return for our co-operation, they are much more likely to do so now than they wi he after they have overcome the greatest difaculty of construction and the railway has emerged into the plains.

(Initialled) IT 1.1 S.Memorandum on the Bagdad Railway, and possible British participation therein. 1 . This Memorandum deals with the question of possible British co-operation in the construction of the Bagdad Railway. 2. The following official papers, &amp;c., have been consulted, among others, and when cited in the text are referred to by the letters shown opposite their h i mes below:— (A) . Foreign Office Print.

In addition, the publications of Dr. Rohrbach (“ Die Bagdadbahn,” 1902), A. Chbradame (“ Le Chemin de Per de Bagdad,” 190'!), and Sir AY. Willcocks (“The Restoration of the Ancient Irrigation Works on the Tigris,” 1903), and the Reports of the Anatolian Railway Company have been referred to, as has a personal knowledge of different parts of the route and of the country concerned. 3 . It has appeared unnecessary to recapitulate the history of the Bagdad Railway Scheme from its inception in its present phase in 1899 up to the present date. A resumb of it is given in the Appendix to (C) (Sir G. Clarke’s Memorandum), and its more detailed progress is to be found in (A) and (B) (Foreign Office correspondence and Sir N. R. O’Conor’s despatches). The actual position of affairs at the time of writing is that the German Company which holds the Concession has managed, notwithstanding our refusal in 1903/to participate in the undertaking— dll (a.) To build the first section of the line (125 miles) from Konia to Eregli; &lt; 6 .) To save about 1,000,000/. from the capital which they had raised from the Turkish Government’s guarantee for the construction of this section—a sum which they now ha’ve in hand for future expenses; and (c.) To induce the Porte to agree to hypothecate further revenues, i.e., to give a fresh guarantee for the construction of the second section from Eregli to Adana. 4. The Germans, however, are not satisfied with a guarantee for only one section, they require it for two : for the section to Adana and for the next beyond, which would bring the railhead to a point slightly north of Aleppo. Their reason is that the Eregli-Adana section, which has to pierce the Taurus Mountains, will involve heavy work, and they wish “ to recoup themselves on the level for the great expense that must be incurred.” For the moment things are at a standstill, but “it is thought that they will in reasonable time come to terms with the Porte, and that the security will be found.” vVhen the present Sultan’s Germanophiie tendencies are considered, and his strong desire to see his favourite Mecca Railway connected with Constanti nople is remembered, this forecast does not seem to be improbable. 5. If the Germans do succeed in getting a satisfactory guarantee for the two sections, there is not likely to be much difficulty in raising the necessary capital in Germany, and with that capital and with the 1,000,000/. they already have in hand, there is no reason to doubt that the most costly portion of the line will be built— probably without our participation. Without entering into the various motives that have incited and sustained the Germans in the promotion of this railway, it seems evident that they have a very strong desire to complete it. Their general tactics of recent years with regard to Turkey have been to strengthen her—the antithesis of the immemorial policy of Russia—and the stronger Turkey grows the more Germany is willing to invest in her. The weakening of Russia and the increase of the internal communications of Anatolia, two events which are at present in progress, may both be said to lend strength to1 Turkey, which means to attract further capital from Germany. It would therefore e unwise to predict that, even if the double guarantee is not forthcoming, sufficient money will not be found to complete the two sections. (I Once this were done and the railway was working from Constantinople (Haidar Pasha) to Aleppo (the branch to this town from the main line is very short) the etL ; Germans would find themselves in an exceedingly strong position. They would be ^ Tii complete control of the principal railways in Anatolia, they would command part If the route from the Sultan’s capital to the holy cities of Arabia (the Trench Company are already negotiating for the completion of the last section of their line from Hama to Aleppo) and they would have secured connection with three seaports on the Cilician and Syrian seaboards (Mersina, Beyrout, and Acre). They would fetioij;: have built more than a quarter of their line and would be only 400 miles of easy country distant from Mosul or GOO from Bagdad, either of which places might con- Mmlji ceivably be their terminus in the event of their determining to use the River Tigris instead of building a railway to the Persian Gulf. In such a position they might well he much less disposed to require or even to accent our assistance than they are now. This is a contingency that seems worth ssiootik consideration. 7. If, however, the Germans do not succeed in getting, the double guarantee from the Sultan they may— (a.) Either content themselves with the guarantee for the second section only, of which it is understood they have the refusal ; or ( 6 .) They may cast about to bring in extraneous capital. 1 III ) Ere»li; wh fl; -a 51$! eniiffi, id Erfi W ntliCo# e for* sary^! an# is of / The former of these alternatives is by no means impossible. They would presumably receive the same class of guarantee that they have already had for the Konia-Eregli section. This, capitalised' in the same way as before, should produce over 2,000,000k in addition to which they have 1,000,000/. in hand. To reach Adana they have 125 miles of line to build through what is certainly difficult and moun tainous country. According to Rohrbach it “will probably involve the construction of a tunnel several kilometres in length.” Now the Konia-Eregli section was built at the rate of about 6,000/. a-mile. Allowing 10,000/. a-mile for the construction of the Eregli-Adana section there still remains a balance of nearly 1 , 000 , 000 /. lor tunnelling, and this, at the high rate of the St. Gothard tunnel, is sufficient for four solid miles of such work. Erom personal recollections of the road, over which the present writer has driven in a cart, it is not to be compared for difficulty with the Alps. Once the Germans are at Adana they have again considerably improved their position, for they are, by means of the existing Adana-Mersina railway, in communi cation with the sea, and can at once begin working the line both for the export of cereals and the import of railway material. Without suggesting that they would then refuse to admit British co-operation- as they might do had they succeeded in getting as far as Aleppo it still appears likely that they would be less inclined to give us favourable terms than they aie at present, with the terrors of the Taurus looming ahead. 8 . It would therefore seem that, if negotiations are to be resumed, the present is the most auspicious moment that is likely to be afforded us. Although too mucn importance should not be attached to the clause which compels the Germans to complete the line in.eight years from the date of signature oi the Conventiontor t ie modification ot such clauses is not very arduous to persona giata at Gonstantinop e yet the fact that only some five years are left in which to build nine-tent i* ot t ic me cannot but causa them to feel a little anxious at the present juncture. 9 . The next point that needs consideration is whether participation m t e scneme is likely to he beneficial to us or the reverse. , 10. The General Staff, in a Memorandum of the loth JNovemhei, ^ ( o s'* “pointed out the disadvantages—political, commercial, and strategic ^ control by Germany of a line to the Persian Gulf would entail upon Great Britain. Accepting their views as to the strategic disadvantages—whicli are, indeed, sir men y obvious—it is worth while examining the question from the point ot \iew o . ii isi prestige and of British trade. , . fl 11. British prestige, in so far as it exists independently ot om *7 . 111 ,1 valleys of the Tigris and Euphrates, appears to be principally connected, firstly, wiin the control and influence that we exercise, more than any other Xouei, Q\er vario portions of the Arabian Peninsula and or the Arab race along the Bed feea, toe imtmnOcean, and the Persian Gulf ; and, secondly, with the large pilgrim traffic that movea. every year between India and K_erbela, on the huphrates. 'it is difficult to discern how either our general consideration in the eyes of the A.rabs or our particular position as the local protector of the Shia* section of the Mahommedan faith are to benefit by the introduction of a new and powerful Frankish nation in this part of the Ottoman Empire. There is also little doubt that any loss of prestige we might thereby sustain would react on our position in Southern and v T * ostein Persia, and probably still furthers afield in the more central countries of Asia. TSj 12. The question as to how British commercial prospects are likely to be affected is more within the province of the Board of Trade. ihe trade of Bagdad and Bussorah was in 1903 valued at some 2,500,000/. Most of this was British or Indian, and, in addition, we do about half the carrying trade on the River Tigris, the other half being in the hands of an Ottoman Company belonging to the Sultan. Is this British trade likely to be increased or diminished by the advent of an all-German railway? 13. The following is the opinion of Sir N. R. O’Conor ( (A), p. 33) :— “ Nor must it be forgotten that the Railway Concession carries with it many valuable privileges and advantages. Apart from the large orders for materials for railway construction, &amp;c., it secures extensive mining rights on each side of the line, the right of navigation of the Tigris and Euphrates during the construction of the railway—a concession which will probably he unlimitedly extended—a commercial outlet either at Koweit or elsewhere in the Persian Gulf, an exceptionally favourable position in the future for all enterprise connected with the irrigation of Mesopotamia, &amp;e. Moreover, it can hardly be supposed that no effort will be made to supplant British navigation in its privileged position in the Persian Gulf, and to take advantage of the opportunity to compete with British shipping in those waters. Sir G. Clarke, in the Committee of Imperial Defence Memorandum of January 1905, says:— “ We are therefore confronted with a project which, if carried out under German auspices, will undoubtedly inflict grave injury upon our commerce ” Mr. Waugh, Vice-Consul at Constantinople, who prepared a Memorandum on the whole question in August 1903, comes to the conclusion— 107 “ That, in the event of the development of the country, the Bagdad Railway in German hands might be made a powerful instrument for furthering German commerce to the detriment of its rivals.” Dr. Rohrbach is evidently of the opinion that German trade is going to benefit by the railway, which, taking into account the usual German methods towards their commercial rivals, is unlikely to mean that British trade will benefit also. 14. A more detailed consideration of the terms of the Concession itself, and of the various rights it gives, beyond those enumerated in the preceding Article, such as con struction of brick and tile factories, establishment of warehouses, quays, and ports, and free use of water power for electricity, shows that the commercial possibilities the Germans have in their possession are by no means small. They have already instituted a system of Commercial Agents in Anatolia, they are planning an agricultural hank, and it can hardly be doubted that their skill in the imposition of preferential rates will be exercised in the future. Particularly anxious would they be to oust us from the Tigris navigation, and with the Sultan, who is himself personally interested in the enterprise, to assist them, they would no doubt succeed in their desires in time. Sir W. Willcocks (p. 27) even suggests that with the development of irrigation the Tigris stream may fail for navigation purposes, in which case our steamer service would not have very encouraging prospects. 15. Accordingly, it would appear, again, to be very unwise to assume that British trade would not find itself in a worse position than it is in at present were an all-German line to the Persian Gulf to he constructed. We should be unlikely to receive * The Shia Mahommedans belong - generally to India and Persia, the Sunnis (orthodox), to Turkey and Afghanistan.'-! ' ,n '’ anything new, and quite likely to lose part of what we already possess. Nor must the very important and possible contingency be ignored of the Germans eventually, either by means of the revenues assigned for the kilometric guarantee, or otherwise, getting control of the Turkish customs (see paragraph 17). 16. On the other hand, were the line to be made a joint concern, or to be inter nationalized, the damage to our prestige would not be so evident, and to our military interests would be considerably modified, while the competition which our commerce would incur should be rather stimulating than crushing, 'i 7 As regards the investment from the bondholder’s stand-point, it may be regarded as quite safe under the existing system of kilometric guarantee * The loan would be, secured on provincial revenues which would be collected by the Admims- ^morlndum, tration of the Debt, revenues which usually produce more than the guarantee (about (A&gt; ^ p 2 7, and 700/ a-mile) requires. Recent experience has also shown that a railway has generally Mr, Whitehead, increased the vielding power of the tithes of the provinces through which it passes. (A.), p. 78. The bonds (4 per cent.) which would be issued by the Turkish Government were in the last case taken up at about 86, which gives an interest of 4j per cent., and the bond holders have in addition the security of the particular section of the line concerned. ] S. There is, however, some doubt as to what reliable provincial revenues remain to he hypothecated, as it has already been found necessary to assign some of the tithes of the Bagdad Vilayet to the Konia-Eregli section, and the suggestion has accordingly been nut forward that a 3 per cent, increase on the Turkish Customs duties, which wouhi give 800,000/. per annum and would be ample to cover the interest on the canitid required for the construction of the whole line, should be pledged as the guarantee ! 1 To do this it would be necessary, under Article 8 ot the Decree of (£■), PP- Muharram of 1881, to obtain the consent of the Council of the Ottoman Public Debt, but Sir N. O’Conor is sanguine of this being obtained. , It need hardly be said that without the hypothecation of these or some other analo gous revenues for the kilometric guarantee, the investment considered commercia y, would he bv no means secure, from the point of view of the bondholders. Never theless it might not he unwise, and from political considerations it might al appear to be^he best course open in the final resort, for British capital to participate ITthe venture on the security of the railway alone. The purchase of the Suez Canal shares in 1875, is to some extent analogous, but it seems probable that m the present instance some form of guarantee would be necessary from His Majes y Government. ^ iion is that of working expenses. Here a gam there is a guarantee secured in the same manner as that for construction of about 300 Sd In addition to this, there would be the traffic receipts, estimated by Dr Rohrbach at about 200/. a-mile to begin with, and likely analo-v of the Eski Sheyr-Konia section of the Anatolian Railway) to about 3001 in a few (four to six)y ears.

Willcock’s forecasts of immense future developments, we may safely assume that the lower valleys of the Tigris and Euphrates are quite capable, if properly irrigated, of exporting cereals to a large amount. The country between Aleppo and Mosul, and even as far south as Tekrit, is sufficiently watered by the rainfall—but below that point irrigation becomes a£ necessity, and to make this portion of the line pay well, there is little douht that money would have to be sunk in restoring the old canals and building new ones.* To estimate the amount needed, the work to be done, and the time and rates of return, could only he done by disinterested experts, and even then to a great extent must be conjecture. It would be safer and more economical in every way only to undertake such works when the line was well advanced, and when every opportunity had been taken for studying the question in all its aspects. The population in some of these regions is extremely sparse, in parts only six or seven per square mile, and though labour is cheap and mobile, it would appear to be unwise to embark capital in such an enterprise except gradually. 21. On the railway itself, therefore, it appears that we are unlikely to lose, except for the working expenses of the first few years, and to a comparatively slight amount. The remaining prospects appear to promise us commercial advantages. The more proximate of these advantages are of a negative order, i.e ., the avoidance of the loss of our trade as against the Germans, and the maintenance of oar position as carriers on the Tigris. But in the future, and in return for the investment of capital, there are possibilities which may reasonably be considered as very great. 22 . It accordingly seems (dear that, under the circumstances, and considering especially the present position of the Germans at Constantinople and of their railway in Anatolia, the balance of advantage to us on all grounds would be to participate with them if we can secure sufficiently favourable terms. 23. The final point for consideration is, therefore, what are the sufficiently favourable terms. 24. It is presumed that a condition to negotiation is that we should be given, in so far as we participate, as controlling a position as that of the Germans. This was the rock upon which the pourparlers of 1903 split, and it is likely to be the difficulty again now. It would be unwise to assume that the Germans are more anxious to meet us now than they were two years ago We should therefore prepare our proposals with a view to having to reduce them. 25. The portion of the line in which we are most interested in every way is that between Bagdad and the Persian Gulf. 26. The conditions which Sir G. Clarke lays down as necessary to British interests are ( 1 .) The construction of the Bagdad-Persian Gulf section of the line, together with the contemplated branch from Bagdad to the Persian frontier, by British capital and under British direction. ( 2 .) The retention of this section under British management. (3.) Pooling the general traffic under a working arrangement, giving Great Britain adequate representation on the directorate. (This appears to include “equal rates for British goods.”) 27. But it is no less necessary that we should keep the waterways as well as the railroad in our own hands if either are to be of any real value. Without labouring the point, it seems obvious that unless we had a guarantee the Sultan’s steamers on the Tigris could at any time undercut our freight rates, and even with a guarantee it would be difficult to compete with down-stream rates that are sometimes even now as low as per ton per mile.f The lowest freight rates on the Anatolian Bail way 1902-1903 averaged fcb per ton per mile. There appears also to be no real reason (E.). App. (C.) why the river service should not be extended as far north as Mosul. A steamer ascended in 1837 to Nimrud, a few miles south of Mosul, and the river throughout its lower course seems to be capable of sufficient improvement to make this generally feasible. Should the Sultan or the Germans put steamers on the Tigris above Bagdad I 1 I if - * This question is examined in detail by Willcocks and touched on by Eohrbach. Appendix (A) gives a short summary of Willcocks’ principal statistics. f Down-stream rates (Bagdad to Bussorah), are as low as 7s. 6d. a ton in winter months. iWy Ge tae mins control Hlb7 ?! ^ and ifj' mk iapp® y sls;liti| ll lance I Is; ■erfffiii 3 sas ^ 1 ' 1 iiii i’I® w similar advantage being denied to us, our position, even if it included the entire control of the railway and a share of the navigation of the river below Bagdad, might become Quite ineffective. 28 There will in any case have to be a considerable reduction of freights on the river (they reach at present as high as 37.&lt;? a ton up and 22s. down, the up and down average on all steamers being about 24s.). This, of course, means smaller profits. Winder these circumstances there seems to be no reason why we should not negotiate, Throimh Messrs. Lynch or directly, to take over the Sultan’s service or to work it for him mi an arrangement, receiving a promise in return for protection from future competition. This should also apply to any future navigation that might be under taken on the Lower Euphrates. 29 A further condition, or one subsidiary to Sir G. Clarke’s (3) should preclude the imposition of differential rates of any kind against British goods, either in transit or otherwise, and whether by any transport or storing agency or, in possible even tualities, by the Customs &gt; 30 To obtain these conditions we might as a first proposal offer to construct with British capital the Bagdad-Persian (xulf section—the line to he always and entirely. British the waterways monopoly or something akin to it, and all the subsidiary rights nf the concessionnaire as to factories, warehouses, &amp;c., alluded to above, being granted to us in return. Article XXIX of the Convention would also have to be so modified as to nave us the right of working this section as soon as it was completed 'fliis portion of the line is roughly about 440 miles long, and at iv-00/. a mile (some embankments would be needed which might involve a little expense) should bring the cost to 3,000,000/. That is to say, we should be building about one-third of the total line at one-fifth of the total cost. We could adduce as a further argument the large sums we should eventually have to spend m irrigation. 1,500,000/., according to Dr. Bohrbach, would do a great deal as a first insta men , 31. It is doubtful, however, whether the Germans would accept such turns. _ thev refused we might as a second proposal supplement the above by offering m addition to build the extra 230 miles between Bagdad and Mosul, 'I 10 ’ 1 C0 ^ another 2 000 000/. This would mean that we were building half the entuc about one-third of the entire cost. We should again have to insist on the control o: the waterway, hut might, if pressed, waive the exclusive British control for the Mosu Bagdad pmtion^li thetiadroa^e ^ agree to tlle Anatolian Railvvay tecoming an exclusively German line, in the same way that the Bagdad-Pers an Gulf section became exclusively British— though this seems rather like oflenivt) *_ Germans something which belongs to the Sult m, over which even m theo.y no power, and which they already possess in fact. 33.

It would also obviate any danger of competition between rail and water tiansport, as both would be in our hands. Somewhat similar condi tions prevail in Burmah, where the Irrawadi River and the Rangoon Railway run side by side, and it is understood that the natives on the whole prefer the former means of forwarding goods not because of cheaper rates but because of the corruption^ almost invariably incident to Oriental railway systems. 37. Nothing has been said of the Bagdad-Khanikin branch (100 miles). In the opinion of the present writer, who has travelled over the road, it can be of little use unless it is to connect with a through line by Hamadan to Tehran which, under the present circumstances appear highly improbable. The country through which it passes is low lying and often inundated, the villages are few and wretched, and bulk would in any case have to be broken at the frontier station when mule or camel transport would be resorted to. Were it built, however, its total cost should not exceed 6 , 000 /. a-mile, say 600,000/. in all. 38. As regards Mosul, Bagdad, Kerbela, and Bussorah, the four chief cities through which the main line from Bagdad to the Persian Gulf would pass, they contain a population between them of 500,000 souls. There is no doubt that in the neighbour hood of the line and of the two rivers there is naphtha and coal, and the date and cereal production, at present of considerable size, is certainly capable of great expansion. To a large extent the future commercial prospects are no doubt dependent on the irrigation question, statistics of which in this paper could only be conjecture, but even under existing conditions with better transport facilities the land would almost necessarily become much more remunerative than it is at present. (Q/. para graph 7.) Bagdad is a large market and the chief trade centre of this part of Western Asia, and at Bussorah there are nearly always three to four months arrears of cargo waiting to go up the river. Labour, though scarce, is not dear, while the half sedentary, half nomad population of the valleys is of a type that soon becomes amenable to enlightened rule. Although the country is not fitted for European colonization (which indeed the present Sultan would never allow, though the suggested Secret Convention against it has been denied by Mr. Gwinner), there is no reason why the Circassian element should not be introduced as beneficially into Mesopotamia as it has been into Zor, Syria, and the Hauran. 39. Summarizing the above arguments, the following are the conclusions arrived at (a.) That the Germans are determined to build the Bagdad line somehow, and that it appears reasonably probable that they may succeed in doing so without our participation. {(&gt;.) That if it is built without our participation our general position in this part of Western Asia in the future will be worse than it is now. (c.) That we are not likely to get a better opportunity for negotiation than the present. (d.) That we should therefore participate if the Germans will admit us, and if we can secure for ourselves the Bagdad-Persian Gulf section, the navigation of the Lower Tigris, and equal commercial treatment.

(Signed) CLI BIGHAM, Captain. June 1, 1905. p.g—xt has been suggested that the Germans may only build their railway as far as Bagdad, or at some other point higher up the Tigris, and make use of the river as a means of transport for the remainder of the way to the Persian Gulf. In such a case the general position would appear to be more favourable to us than an all-German line of railway to the sea would be, but less favourable than if we had our own Bagdad-Persian Gulf section. The keynote of our military objections to an all-German line is that we are opposed to the establishment of any new Power on the shores of the Persian Gulf. It is clear that if the Germans finished at Bagdad they would not be at TJmkasr or Koweit—though they might eventually get there. It may therefore be assumed that a German terminus at Bagdad w r ould strategically be rather less damaging to our interests than one on the Persian Gulf. From the political point of view the situation would be modified in a somewhat similar degree. The Coast and Desert Arabs and the Mahommedan pilgrims would not see and hear quite so much of the Germans if limited to Bagdad as they would if Kerbela and Bussorah were on a German railway. Commercially the outlook is less certain. At first it would appear that Messrs. Lynch and the Sultan would between them control all the river traffic. But the Germans have already secured in the Convention the basis of a right of navigation on the Tigris (see paragraph 13), and it is hardly probable that they would not take care to guarantee themselves in advance from the effects of a British and Turkish traffic monopoly. Once they had effected this and had their ovn boats running, loading and unloading at their own quays, and connecting with their own railway, om prospects would not look very encouraging. . It is, however, by no means certain that all the German objects would be achieve by a line that ended at Bagdad. . i As has been suggested before, there are probably both military and poll lea ambitions in their project, and neither of these would be adequately remuneratec i the railway stopped short at an inland town, there would be far less chance o a German port on the Persian Gulf, of German liners calling there, or of predominant German influence on the waste lands of Arabia. rr , Nor would they be so well off commercially as they might have been. iey would be sacrificing the future profits ensuing from the development o pai 0 e best corn-growing lands in Mesopotamia and from the resulting freights, t icy won c no carry the large pilgrim traffic that comes from Persia and India, it is ex leme y improbable that they would secure the British mails with their subsidy, and imally, they would not be in direct communication with the sea or with the aigc ci ics o Kerbela and Bussorah. , , r 0 , They would also have to bring considerable influence to bea* on t ie ^ u an o ^ day, who might not be His present Majesty, to so modify their concession as to give10 them navigation rights on the Tigris below their railway line—for otherwise they would be at the mercy of the present controllers of the river traffic—and they would also have to get the clause abrogated which binds them to construct ail the railway within the specified period (live years). It appears more likely, therefore, that they will go through with the whole line, though if they ended at Bagdad it seems that British interests would suffer iess than if they continued to the Persian Gulf. 1 % C.

It will he observed that the fact that the money for the construction of the line is to he raised by an issue of Government bonds, and that the holders of these bonds will not have any voice in the management of the Company, does not in any way modify the constitution of the Company as described above, and does not in any way affect its international character, as is alleged in Mr. Waugh’s Commercial Eeport of the 16th March, a copy of which, owing to my absence in England, I unfortunately did not see. The result of the constitution above described would be that any two of the groups could command an absolute majority of the Board, and that the Company would be really international in the sense that it would be impossible to direct its policy and working to the benefit of any single country at the expense of the others. Much stress has been laid on the fact that the guarantee for the construction of duties, which would result from the revision of the existing Treaties of Commerce, and that any increase of the revenue thus produced is already assigned for the benefit of the bondholders under the Decree of Moharrem. that the Ottoman Government would consent to impose additional taxes on Ottoman consumers without any benefit to its own Exchequer. Some years before the Bagdad Bailway question had come into being, this fact had been recognized by the Council of the Debt, and arrangements were proposed for the partition 0 f the expected increase. It is morally certain that this principal would be accepted by the bond holders, whatever the circumstances in which the revision of the Treaties were carried out. Not to recognize it would be to act in a manner contrary to their own interests and, indeed, might produce the danger resulting from Shylock’s insistance on his pound of flesh. Eurthermore, it is evident that the restriction on the customs duties cannot equitably or practically be maintained in permanence. It is a stipulation resulting from ancient Treaties, and not involving any reciprocal advantages to the Turks. The Powers deny to the Turks the right to denounce this restriction, but this denial is a limitation of sovereignty to which hardly any other country in the world submits. * * . It would be contrary to British traditions to refuse to a country a legitimate means of increasing its revenue, and it would be an untenable position to refuse to agree to such increase because the proceeds were to be used for railway construction, which, whether it pays directly or not, develops the country, increases her other revenues, and xacilitates the maintenance of order and the defence of the Empire against external aggression. The increased customs revenue would be levied to a considerable extent on Biitish tiade, but not so as to give a preference against British trade. There may, at first, be some diminution of the whole volume of trade, but it will be onlv temporary, and the opening up of the country, the creation of new r markets, and the increased prosperity of the inhabitants will soon compensate for this loss. Moieo\ er, it is not to be supposed that England or other foreign Powers will agiee to an augmentation of customs dues, whether they are appropriated to the cons inction of the Bagdad Bailway or to other purposes economically less advan- ageous, unless they obtain in return certain Concessions which they consider beneficial n } en rn e i Jnd commerce &gt; an( i a quid pro quo for their consent to the increase of the Customs Tariff. -*-t a ^ sc |' represented that the Bailway could be worked in a manner xu udi, u Lm pointed out mine course of the discussions in the press and elsewhere lliat s° long as ihBAnaiohaaEaiiwiiy from Haidar Pasha to Konia remains in German nc s, re m ernational character oi the line from Konia onwards will not he a the whole line can only be provided by the proceeds of the increase of the customs This is true; but it is also true that if the bondholders insisted on the satisfaction of their entire claim they would receive nothing at all; for it is not to be anticipated If.* ^ 1 ^ r&gt; V 1 -a-vc-Li tr caj UC VVU1JYCU.

This apprehension is not well founded. Such nreterences are mreetlv nmliilUfari mr — .. a ^ j-, t to goods arrivingsufficient guarantee for impartial treatment; that the German Company will, in fact, hold the key of the door by which the through traffic must pass. This is a point of the first importance, deserving careful consideration ; hut an examination of the whole position will go far, at any rate, to dispel any anxiety on this account. In the first place, the representatives of the Anatolian Hallway Company have formerly announced their readiness to vest the control of their line in the International Company at some future period ; and there are sufficient guarantees for the carrying out of this under taking in the fact that it would he open to the British Government, in the event of failure to carry it out, to refuse the promised facilities for a port in the Persian Gulf, and to withdraw their assurance as to the conveyance of the Indian mails ; and also in the fact that, when the Bagdad line has been completed throughout the greater part of its length, it would he so indispensable to the prosperity of the Anatolian line that the latter could not afford to take up a hostile or exclusive attitude. This is the more certain since Haidar Pasha does not afford the only point of access. It is evident that the Bagdad line must have an exit somewhere on the Gulf of Alexandretta, and it is also clear that by combination with the Prench line from Smyrna to Afioun Kerahissar or the English line from Smyrna to Dineir a competing outlet could be secured at Smyrna. &gt; . . While insisting upon the extreme importance of the eventual internationalization of the whole line from sea to sea, I would point out that the drawbacks resulting for British commerce from the existing ownership of the Anatolian line and of the harbour at Haidar Pasha are frequently exaggerated. It has often been stated, and -rains colour from the remarks in Mr. Yice-Consul TV augh s Beport, that goods arriving by train at Constantinople and ferried to Haidar Pasha without breaking bulk would be speciallv exempted from quay dues, to which goods arriving by sea are subiect. If such a provision existed, it would act unfavourably to German commerce as well as to British, since it is inconceivable that heavy goods coming from Germany should abandon cheap sea-transport for the far more costly land transport Besides, i mav be assumed from the statement made in the “ Times ” of the 24th instant by Herr Gwinner, or some other high official of the Bagdad Bailway, that no such provision does, as a matter of fact, exist. . . . . •j • If the Railway be regarded merely in the light of an industrial speculation it - necessary to bear in mind that without a sufficient kilometnc guarantee the construc tion is more than problematical, and that, supported by a kilometric |uarant^ the shareholders will probably be as well or better protected from loss of then capital than in the average of such undertakings in semi-cmlized countries. , No one supposes that the whole Railway will pay at once, it ha *^ final development, many years must pass before the entire line will pay, though certain sections may be remunerative from the start.

[7th April 1903.] Answered by Mr. Balfour. There have been no formal communications between His Majesty’s Govern ment and any Foreign Government on the subject of the Baghdad Railway. The proposed railway is not, as suggested in the Question, to be a German railway. The subject was referred to in two brief conversations, one with the French . and one wdth the German Ambassador, about 13 months ago. Lord Lansdowne then stated that we should not regard the undertaking with unfriendly eyes provided that British capital and British interests were placed at least on terms of equality with those of any other Power. I am not aware that these conversations have (in the language of the Question) had any “ results,” or have exercised any influence on subsequent events. Communications have been and are still going on with British capitalists on the subject. No final arrangements have been arrived at. The proposals under consideration involve no guarantee of a postal or any other subsidy. The suggestions to be made to us are we understand ( 1 ) that British capital and British control are to be on an absolute equality with the capital and control of any other Power; (2) that, in respect to the negotiations which are now going on with the Turkish Government for a new Commercial Treaty (and which, quite apart from the Baghdad Railway, raise the question of increasing the Turkish Customs), His Majesty’s Government should not object to^a reasonable increase in these duties, although a part of the increase is to be used in guaranteeing a railway so important for the commercial interests of Turkey ; (3) that, if the railway should prove to be a substantially better route for conveying the mails to India, it may be used for conveying those mails, on terms to be agreed upon hereafter; (4) that His Majesty’s Government should assist, not by money or the promise of money, but by their good offices in providing a proper terminus at or near Koweit. These suggestions will be carefully considered. \7th April 1903.]3 . 3 ™*^ Department;. PARLIAMENTARY NOTICE Session 190 3 . Date.

The terms of possible British, French, Russian, Ottoman and German participation are debated including the Baghdad Railway Convention. Also discussed are the terms of loans made to the Persian Government and the desirability of ensuring that any extension from Baghdad to a terminus on the shores of the Gulf was controlled by Britain.Further discussion surrounds the motivations and strategies of British competitors in the area. The volume features a copy (ff 385-396) of the text of the 'Baghdad Railway: Board of Trade Memorandum', a number of newspaper cuttings from German and British media, as well as seven maps.The principal correspondents in the volume include the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (Henry Charles Keith Petty-Fitzmaurice, 5th Marquess of Lansdowne; Sir Edward Grey), His Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople (Sir Nicholas O'Connor), the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (Sir Charles Hardinge, Sir Thomas Henry Sanderson), the Under-Secretary of State for India (Earl Percy, Sir Arthur Godley), the Viceroy of India (Lord Curzon of Keddleston), the Secretary to the Political and Secret Department of the India Office (Sir Richmond Richie) and the London Manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia (George Newell).Each part includes a divider which gives the subject and part numbers, the year the subject file was opened, the subject heading, and a list of correspondence references contained in that part by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Viceroy and Governor-General of India in Council</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Imperial Bank of Iran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Baghdad</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000365.0x00038d#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
