Dear Colonel Galloway, I am desired to forward herewith for your infomation 2 copies of the paaphlet I.B.S.I, ••Ciril Appointments in India and Burma* 1 giving details of the scheme covering recruitment of 'war service' candidates which was announced in Army Instructions (India) No. 444 dated the 1st June, 1945. Also enclosed is a note in amplification of page 10 of the pamphlet, and application form I.B.S.2 (both in duplicate. 2* Officers holding regular Commissions are not eligible to apply for entry to the Civil Services under this scheme, but it has been decided that exceptions may be made in the c^se of regular Commissioned Officers (within the specified age limits) of the Indian Anqr who apply for Indian Political Service, each case being considered individually on its merits. 3« As there are occasions when prospective candidates for the Indian Political Service approach serving Political Officers with requests for information about terms and conditions of service and the procedure for forwarding their applications for transfer, I am to suggest that a copy of the enclosure to this letter be circulated to the officers under your control. It is hoped that during the course of the next few months a number of really good candidates may be obtained for the Indian Political Service and individual Political officers may have the opportunity of furthering the interests of the service in personal contact with Army officers of the right type.

The Indian Civil Service and the Indian Police, and the Burma Civil Service (Class I) and the Burma Police (Class I), are in urgent need of recruits. 1 he severe strain to which these Services, in common with other overseas Services, have been subjected during the war has had to be borne at a time when their normal intake of young men has been cut off, and it stands to their credit that the high standards of administration that are traditional to them have been consistently and fully maintained. It is, however, in the interests not only of India and Burma themselves, but also of the British Commonwealth and Empire as a whole that the strain upon them should be relieved at the earliest possible moment and it is for this reason that members of His Majesty's Forces who are selected for appointment to the Indian Civil Service or the Indian Police, or to the Burma Civil Service (Class I) or the Burma Police (Class I), will, wherever necessary, be released in Class B of the Release Schemes! subject to military considerations in each individual case. .The duties and responsibilities of members of these Services have always been, and will undoubtedly continue to be, arduous and exacting; but I am confident that as in the past this will be accepted by the young men of the day as a challenge and an opportunity of rendering service in a field worthy of their abilities and sense of citizenship. The men now to be appointed will, like those who have gone before them, receive their appointments from the Secretary of State, that is, from a Minister of the Crown in the United Kingdom. But it is an essential corollary of His Majesty's Government's declared policy of promoting full self-government in India and Burma that, from dates as yet uncertain in either case, appointments held by tenure from the Secretary of State will cease. I must therefore make it unmistakably clear to men who are contemplating entering the Indian Civil Service, the Indian Police, the Burma Civil Service (Class I) and the Burma Police (Class I) that constitutional develop ments may necessitate their appointments under the Secretary of State being terminated at any time, subject to due notice being given and to the payment of the grants set out in the appendices to this leaflet. At the same time it is my belief that, when that time comes, opportunities for continuing to render good service to India and Burma will not be lacking to men whose devotion is to the peoples of those countries and whose capacity for efficient and disinterested service has already been proved.SECTION 1. THE INDIAN CIVIL SERVICE AND THE INDIAN POLICE METHOD OF RECRUITMENT It is intended to resume recruitment to the Indian Civil Service and the Indian Police as soon as possible. Recruitment continued on a diminishing scale after the outbreak of war, but was later suspended—partially in March, 1941, and totally after the examina tion held in India in January, 1943—in order that young men joining His Majesty's Forces might not be at a disadvantage as regards their chances of eventually being appointed to these Services. It was made clear when the suspensions of recruitment were announced that the vacancies which would consequently remain* unfilled would eventually be filled from among candidates with approved ' war service.' The Recruitment Regulations printed in Section 9 of this leaflet accordingly require candidates to have undertaken ' war service ' and lay down definitions of it for this purpose (see Regulations I (A) (4) and II (A) (4) ). The Regulations also lay down the qualifications in respect of nationality and domicile, age, education, character and health that ate required of candidates. It is the intention that these Regulations should govern recruit ment to vacancies in the Indian Civil Service and the Indian Police which have already accrued and which will accrue up to the end of the war (including the war with Japan). So far as the filling of such vacancies is concerned, the undertaking given when recruitment was partially suspended in March, 1941, that young men joining His Majesty's Forces would be afforded substantially the same opportunity to enter these Services after the war was over as they possessed at that time, requires that the ratio of British to Indian recruits, and the reservations for minorities in respect of the latter, should be the same as they were before the war, due allowance being made for those recruited since the outbreak of hostilities. It is clearly not possible, in view of the uncertain duration of the war, to ^ declare at present the total number of vacancies in the Indian Civil Service and the Indian Police which will be filled under these Regulations, but the following statements give a general indication of the scale of the opportunities that may be open thereunder :— Indian Civil Service* To be filled by European candidates f To be filled by Indian candidates f Vacancies already accrued up to the end of 1944 Vacancies that will accrue in subsequent years while the war lasts 98 24 each year 71 24 each year * The Indian Civil Service vacancies shown in this Table include those to be filled by recruits who are to be posted to the Indian Political Service (see Section 4.) t The terms ' European candidates ' and ' Indian candidates ' are used in this leaflet to denote candidates of European descent and of non-Asiatic domicile and candidates of Indian descent or domicile, respectively.Indian Police To be filled by European candidates To be filled by Indian candidates Vacancies already accrued up to the end of 1944 Vacancies that will accrue in subsequent years while the war lasts .. 63 12^1 in alter- 13 J nate years 33 11 each year The arrangements for the resumption of recruitment have been designed to ensure that, so far as possible, all eligible candidates, whether they are in His Majesty's Forces or in civil occupations and wherever they may be, will have substantially the same opportunity of competing for appointment. Members of His Majesty's Forces all over the world are being informed of the intention to resume recruitment by means of special Admiralty Fleet Order, Army Council Instruction and Air Ministry Order and by corresponding instruments in India Command. Press Notice 8 on the subject are being issued for the information of civilian candidates. Both the Service instruments and the Press Notices describe the procedure to be followed by intending candi dates, but it may be convenient that a summary should be given in this leaflet. Application forms (IBS. 2) can be obtained by Naval candidates through Resettlement Information Officers, by Army candidates through Commanding Officers, by R.A.F. candidates through Education Officers and by any candidates. Service or civilian, from either the Secretary, India and Burma Recruitment, India Office, Whitehall, London, S.W.I or the Secretary, Federal Public Service Commission, 10 UnderhilJ Lane, Delhi, India, which ever is the more convenient. Instructions about completing the application form and the address to which it should be sent, when completed, will be found on the form itself. Applications from candidates who are qualified on the date of issue of the Recruitment Regulations have to reach the prescribed address (see Note 5 on the application form) within six months of that date, and from candidates who become qualified subsequent to the date of issue of the Recruitment Regulations within six months of their becoming qualified (see Regulations I (B) (3) {a) and II (B) (3)). Submission of an application will be entirely without prejudice to the question when the applicant will be able to attend for selection or, if selected, when he will be released to take up appointment. Applications will be acknowledged. Candidates are themselves responsible' for notifying any changes that may occur in their addresses after they have submitted their application (see Note 7 on the application form). 1 here will be a preliminary and a final selection. Preliminary selection will be carried out, either in the United Kingdom or in India or elsewhere, by means of Selection Boards of the type used4 for selecting candidates for Commissions in the Army but specially constituted and adapted for the purpose. Candidates successful at the preliminary selection will undergo a final selection, which will be conducted by an Interview Board in London in the case of European candidates or by the Federal Public Service Commission in India in the case of Indian candidates. No entrance fees will be charged and neither preliminary nor final selection will include any written tests of an academic nature. Candidates may be required to undergo a medical examination before being summoned for preliminary selection. Subject to Service requirements, members of His Majesty's Forces will be given every facility to attend for selection, including, where travel is involved, the necessary travel documents. A candidate whose selection has been finally approved will receive an offer of appointment and, on his accepting it, will be required to take up his appointment or enter upon a course of training, as the case may be, as soon as this can be arranged. In the case of a candidate in His Majesty's Forces, application will be made by the recruiting authority for his early release, where necessary, under Class B of the Release Schemes. In the case of a civilian candidate, the date of taking up appointment or entering upon a course of training will be settled either with the candidate himself or with his employer, as may be appropriate. It should be clearly understood that no one (including prisoners of war, in respect of whom special arrange ments will be made) will suffer any disadvantage as regards his prospects of finally securing an appointment either owing to deferment, on account of factors beyond his own control, of the sub mission of his application, or his attendance for preliminary or final selection, or, if he is selected, owing to delay in taking up his appoint ment or entering upon a course of training. Favourable con sideration will be given to requests for permission to postpone taking up appointment or to delay entering upon training in order to enjoy a reasonable period of holiday.SECTION 2. THE INDIAN CIVIL SERVICE DUTIES At the beginning of his service an I.C.S. officer serves as Assistant to a District Officer in the Province to which he has been allotted, and in this capacity assists the District Officer and learns a District Officer's work. After a few years of service, during which he may serve for a spell in the Secretariat of the Provincial Government or, perhaps, of the Central Government, he is posted either to the executive side of the Service with a view to appointment as a District Officer, or to the judicial side with a view to appointment as a District and Sessions Judge. The District Officer, known in some Provinces as the Collector and in others as the Deputy Commissioner, is the head of one of the large territorial units called Districts into which every Province is divided; he is, for that area, the principal executive officer of Government and the chief magistrate. His duties are many and varied and he has wide statutory powers. He is responsible broadly for the good government of his charge and for the maintenance within it of peace and order. The District and Sessions Judge, whose duties extend over both the criminal and civil courts in the District, exercises the highest original jurisdiction in the District and also appellate jurisdiction over both magistrates and civil judges. Above the posts of Collector or Deputy Commissioner and of District and Sessions Judge, respectively, there are higher posts for which an officer may be selected in the course of his service. TERMS OF APPOINTMENT Appointments will be made by the Secretary of State for Inclia. While provision is made for the case in which an officer is able to serve under the Secretary of State for the full normal period, candi dates are warned that their appointments under the Secretary of State will be liable to be terminated at any time on account of constitutional changes, subject to their being given twelve months' notice, CONDITIONS OF SERVICE Period of Probation —All recruits will be appointed on probation. Those under the age of 25 on the 2nd August preceding the date on which th^y receive their orders of appointment will be required to undergo training for one year at a training centre in India before proceeding to the Provinces to which they have been allotted. At the end of this period of training they will be required to pass an examination, the subjects of which will include the Indian Penal Code, Indian History, an Indian language and riding. Other recruits will proceed direct to the Provinces to which they have been allotted, where they will be on probation for one year.Seniority —All recruits will be treated for purposes of seniority as though they had been appointed in the year in which they attained or attain the age of 23 and will be placed below officers appointed in that year before the suspension of recruitment. The seniority of *' war service ' recruits inter se will be determined according to their age. Pay —Pay will be drawn by recruits from the date on which they begin their period of probation. It consists of basic pay, which is payable monthly in rupees, and overseas pay, which is payable in rupees during the first four years of service and thereafter in sterling. Overseas pay is admissible only to officers of non-Asiatic domicile. Basic pay is regulated by a time-scale ranging from Rs. 450 per mensem to Rs. 2,250 per mensem.* Overseas pay ranges from Rs. 150 per mensem to ^30 per mensem. The full time-scale is set out in Appendix I. Officers will be required to pass prescribed examinations within certain periods ; failure to pass these examina tions may affect the grant of increments. Posts above those of Deputy Commissioner or Collector and of District and Sessions Judge carry rates of pay which are considerably higher than the maximum of the time-scale. The stage at which recruits will enter the time-scale will be determined according to their age as follows Age at date of beginning probation Stage of time-scale Under 24 Over 24 but under 25 Over 25 but under 26 Over 26 but under 27 Over 27 but under 28 Over 28 but under 29 Over 29 but under 30 1st year 2nd year 3rd year 4th year 5th year 6th year 7th year Pay on the senior time-scale is drawn by officers on promotion, either in an acting or substantive capacity, to certain posts graded as *' superior posts ' and carrying greater responsibilities. Leave —Leave is calculated in terms of leave on average pay at the rate of 5/22nds of the period spent on duty in the case of officers of non-Asiatic domicile and 2/llths in the case of officers of Asiatic domicile. Only a portion of the leave so calculated may be taken on average pay; the remainder is convertible into leave on half average pay for twice the period. Leave is accumulated and may be taken at intervals during service. It cannot be claimed as of right, but is given or refused at the discretion of Government. Passages —In addition to a free passage to India on first appoint ment, an officer of non-Asiatic domicile is entitled, on the satis factory completion of his period of probation, to a credit in a passage account equivalent to the cost of four return passages between * The present exchange value of the rupee-is Is. 6d. Rs. 1,000 per mensem is equal to ^900 per annum.7 Bombay and London at P. &amp; O. 1st Class B rates. A similar credit is admissible for his wife if he is married at the date of his appoint ment, or a proportionate credit if he marries later. A credit of the cost of a single passage is admissible for each of his children, up to the age of 12 in the case of a male child and up to the age of 21 in the case of a female if still unmarried. Subject to the Passage Regula tions, the officer is entitled to receive during his service passages for himself and for his family within the amounts of these credits. If he prefers to do so he can travel at a cheaper rate and so increase the number of journeys he can make at Government expense. These arrangements may be modified if it becomes possible eventually to introduce a scheme for leave with journeys by air. Provision for Retirement —Appointments will not be pensionable. During his service under the Secretary of State an officer will have the right to retire voluntarily at any time after completing 5 years' service and will be entitled to the retirement grant appropriate to the length of his service as shown in the second column of the table in Appendix II. If an officer's services are terminated on account of ill-health, he will receive either the retirement grant appropriate to his length of service or the commutation value, calculated on an age plus state of health basis, pf the invalid pension admissible under the Civil Service Regulations to a pensionable officer of the same length of service, whichever is the greater. If as a result of con stitutional changes an officer's appointment under the Secretary of State is terminated and he does not receive and accept an offer to continue to serve under government in India, he will be entitled to the grant appropriate to his length of service as shown in the third column of the table in Appendix II. It is, however, hoped that many of the officers whose appointments under the Secretary of State are terminated will be invited and will be willing to continue to serve under government in India. In such cases the grants appropriate to their length of service under the Secretary of State will be placed to their credit with an independent authority and will be paid to them on their leaving the service of government in India, or to their heirs if they die while still serving. The conditions for . the continuance of their service under government in India will be for settlement by the Indian Government concerned. Provident Fund —Officers will be required to contribute to a Provident Fund. Provision for Widows —The widow of an officer dying in service will receive a grant equal to that to which at the date of his death her husband would have been entitled on voluntary retirement.8 SECTION 3. THE INDIAN POLICE DUTIES In the early years of his service an officer of the Indian Police serves as an Assistant to a District Superintendent of Police and, after a few years of service in this capacity, is posted to the charge of the Police of a District. The District Superintendent of Police is the right-hand man of the District Officer in all that concerns the maintenance of public tranquillity and the control of crime. It is his duty to keep the District Officer fully informed of all matters affecting law and order in the District. He is at the same time the executive head of the District Police Force and directly responsible for all matters relating to its internal economy, training and management, for the main tenance of its discipline and for the efficient performance of all its preventive and executive duties. Above the posts of District Superintendent there are a number of higher posts for which an officer may be selected. TERMS OF APPOINTMENT As for Indian Civil Service. CONDITIONS OF SERVICE Period of Probation —All recruits will be appointed on probation and will be required within two years to pass prescribed depart mental examinations, after passing which they will be confirmed in the Service. On appointment, they will be attached to a Police Training School in the Province to which they have been allotted, where they will receive practical instruction in the duties of a Police Officer, and will be given facilities for the study of criminal law and procedure, and Indian languages. Seniority —Recruits will be treated for purposes of seniority as though they had been appointed in the year in which they attained or attain the age of 21 and will be placed below direct recruits appointed in that year before the suspension of recruitment. The seniority of '* war service ' recruits inter se will be determined according to their age. P ay —Pay will be drawn by recruits from the date on which they begin their period of probation. It consists of basic pay, which is payable monthly in rupees, and overseas pay, which is payable in rupees during the first four years of service and thereafter in sterling. Overseas pay is admissible only to officers of non-Asiatic domicile. Basic pay is regulated by a time-scale ranging from Rs. 350 per mensem to Rs. 1,350 per mensem. Overseas pay ranges from Rs. 100 per mensem to ^30 per mensem. The full time-scale is set out in Appendix HI. A number of higher posts, which are filled by selection, carry special rates of pay considerably above the maximum of the time -scale.9 The stage at which recruits will enter the time-scale will be determined according to their age, as follows :— Age at date of beginning probation Stage of time-scale Under 22 Over 22 but under 23 Over 23 but under 24 Over 24 but under 25 Over 25 but under 26 Over 26 but under 27 Over 27 but under 28 1st year 2nd year 3rd year 4th year 5th year 6th year 7th year Leave —As for Indian Civil Service. Passages —As for Indian Civil Service. Provision for Retirement—As for Indian Civil Service, except as regards the amounts of the grants admissible, for which 5ee Appendix IV. Provident Fund —Officers will be required to contribute to a Provident Fund. Provision for Widows —As for Indian Civil Service, except as regards the amounts of the grants admissible, for which see Appendix IV.10 SECTION 4. THE INDIAN POLITICAL SERVICE METHOD OF RECRUITMENT The Indian Political Service is recruited in normal times, under the personal supervision of the Viceroy, mainly from members of the Indian Civil Service and officers of the Indian Army who have had some years' experience of India and possess the required personal qualities. Recruitment by this means continued on a diminishing scale after the outbreak of war but, owing to wartime factors, vacancies have accrued and are accruing in the Service. By the end of 1944 16 vacancies had accrued for European candidates and 5 for Indian candidates ; and vacancies will continue to accrue at the rate of 6 for European candidates and 2 for Indian candidates each year while the war lasts. It is the intention that these vacancies should be filled from among candidates with ' war service ' who compete for the Indian Civil Service in accordance with the arrangements described in Section 1 of this leaflet. Candidates who wish to be considered for the Indian Political Service must say so in reply to the appropriate question (23 or 30) in the application form (IBS. 2). DUTIES The Service combines administrative and diplomatic duties ; the word ' Political ' has no connection with British Indian politics. The scope of the Service may vary in the future but at present it covers :— {a) The conduct of the Crown's relations with the Indian States, through a secretariat in New Delhi and a number of Residencies and Agencies in the various States ; this includes, from time to time, supervisory control of the administration of individual States,' e.g., during a Ruler's minority. [h) The administration of the settled districts of the North-West Frontier Province and the conduct of local relations with the various nomadic and warlike tribes in the unadministered fringe of India, as also the supervision of various backward tribal areas in other parts of India. (c) The conduct of India's external relations, through a secretariat in New Delhi and by filling certain diplomatic, quasi -diplomatic and consular posts in foreign countries of special importance to India, such as Afghanistan, China, Nepal, Persia, Sinkian/? Tibet and the U.S.A. {d) The conduct of His Majesty's Government's relations with the various Arab Sheikhdoms in the Persian Gulf. The qualifications for the various branches of the Service include a capacity to understand and if necessary control the general administration of a District or a tribal area, a certain degree of proficiency in dynastic and ceremonial questions, an intelligent appreciation of constitutional, commercialr judicial and inter-. 11 national developments, ability to hold one's own in social contacts with Indian Princes, distinguished foreigners and tribal chiefs, a flair for Eastern languages and some interest in field sports. TERMS OF APPOINTMENT Successful candidates will be appointed to the Indian Civil Service by the Secretary of State for India and will be assigned to the Indian Political Service. They will remain members of the Indian Civil Service and will be subject to the terms of appointment of that Service (see Section 2). CONDITIONS OF SERVICE As for Indian Civil Service except that pay will be drawn on the special time-scale set out in full in Appendix V. (Initial pay will be determined by age as in the case of the I.C.S.) A number of higher posts, which are filled by selection, carry special rates of pay con siderably above the maximum of the time-scale. Although there is only a single time-scale for the Indian Political Service, the pay is in fact not less favourable than that of the Indian Civil Service, as officers holding ' superior posts ' {i .e., posts carrying special responsibilities) during the first nine years of their service receive a charge allowance in addition to pay on the time-scale. (§)12 SECTION 5. THE BURMA CIVIL SERVICE (CLASS I), THE BURMA POLICE (CLASS I) AND THE BURMA FRONTIER SERVICE METHOD OF RECRUITMENT It is intended to resume recruitment to the Burma Civil Service (Class I), the Burma Police (Class I) and the Burma Frontier Service, which has been suspended since the outbreak of war with Japan, as soon as possible. Recruitment will be governed by the Recruitment Regulations printed in Section 9 of this leaflet. These Regulations will govern recruitment to all the vacancies for European candi dates * which have accrued by the date of issue of the Regulations and to such of the accrued vacancies for Burman candidates * as are allotted, to candidates who are outside Burma. The majority of the vacancies for Burman candidates will be reserved until the Civil Government returns to Burma, when revised Regulations suited to the exceptional conditions in which the majority of Burman candidates have lived during the past three years may be expected to be issued. Accrued vacancies in these Services available for European candidates are expected to amount to about 80 in all. So far as possible, they will be allotted to candidates from the Civil Affairs Service (Burma), who will be recruited under the Regulations and must apply in the manner prescribed therein. This is in keeping with the announcement made in A.C.I. 1426 of 1944 that officers of the Civil Affairs Service (Burma) whose military service had been satisfactory and who fulfilled certain stated requirements would be eligible for consideration at the end of the period of military administration for appointment under the Civil Government of Burma and that officers who signified their desire to be considered for such appointment would in due course receive further particulars and be informed of the method of application. Members of His Majesty's Forces all over the world are being informed of the intention to resume recruitment by means of special Admiralty Fleet Order, Army Council Instruction and Air Ministry Order and by corresponding instruments in India Command. Press notices on the subject are being issued for the information of civilian candidates. Both the Service instruments and the Press notices describe the procedure to be followed by intending candi dates, but it may be convenient that a summary should be given in this leaflet. Application forms (IBS. 2) can be obtained by Naval candidates through Resettlement Information Officers, by Army candidates through Commanding Officers, by R.A.F. candidates through Education Officers and by any candidates. Service or civilian, from either the Secretary, India and Burma Recruitment, India Office, Whitehall, London, S.W.I, or the Secretary, Federal Public Service Commission, 10 Underbill Lane, Delhi, India, whichever is the more * The terms ' European candidates ' and ' Burman candidates ' are used in this leaflet to denote candidates of European descent and of non-Asiatig domicile and candidates of Burman descent or domicile, respectively.13 convenient. Instructions about completing the application form and the address to which it should be sent, when completed, will be found on the form itself. Applications will be accepted only from candidates who are qualified in all respects at the date of issue of the Recruitment Regulations and they must reach the prescribed address (see Note 5 on the application form) within six months of the date of issue of the Regulations (see Regulation III (B) (3) ). Submission of an application will be entirely without prejudice to the question when the applicant will be able to attend for selection or, if selected, when he will be released to take up appointment. Applications will be acknowledged. Candidates are themselves responsible for notifying any changes that may occur in their addresses after they have submitted their applications (see Note 7 on the application form). There will be a preliminary and a final selection. Preliminary selection will be carried out, either in the United Kingdom or in India or elsewhere, by means of Selection Boards of the type used for selecting candidates for Commissions in the Army, but specially constituted and adapted for the purpose. European candidates successful at the preliminary selection will undergo a final selection which will be conducted by an Interview Board in London. All Burman candidates who have undergone preliminary selection will subsequently undergo a final selection which will be conducted by a Burma Interview Board in India or Burma. No entrance fees will be charged and neither preliminary nor final selection will include any written tests of an academic nature. Candidates may be required to undergo a medical examination before being summoned for preliminary selection. The arrangements summarised in this paragraph may have to be modified in the case of candidates from the Civil Affairs Service (Burma). Subject to Service requirements, members of His Majesty's Forces will be given every facility to attend for selection, including, where travel is involved, the necessary travel documents. ^ A candidate whose selection has been finally approved will receive an offer of appointment and, if he accepts it, will be required to take up duty as soon as can be arranged. In the case of a candidate in His Majesty's Forces (other than the Civil Affairs Service (Burma)) application will be made by the recruiting authority for his early release, where necessary, under Class B of the Release Schemes. In the case of a civilian candidate, the date of taking up appoint ment will be settled either with the candidate himself or with his employer, as may be appropriate. It should be clearly understood that no one (including prisoners of war, in respect of whom special arrangements will be made) will suffer any disadvantage as regards his prospects of finally securing an appointment either owing to deferment, on account of factors beyond his own control, of the sub mission of his application or his attendance for preliminary or final selection, or, if he is selected, owing to delay in taking up his appoint ment. Favourable consideration will be given to requests for permission to postpone taking up appointment in order to enjoy a reasonable period of holiday.u SECTION 6. BURMA CIVIL SERVICE (CLASS I) DUTIES At the beginning of his service an officer of the Burma Civil Service (Class 1) serves as an Assistant Commissioner and in this capacity assists the Deputy Commissioner of a District and Jearns a Deputy Commissioner's work. After a few years of service, during which he may serve for a spell in the Secretariat, he is posted either to the executive side of the Service with a view to appointment as a Deputy Commissioner, or to the judicial side with a view to appointment as a District and Sessions Judge. The Deputy Commissioner is the head of one of the territorial units called Districts into which Burma is divided ; he is, for that area, the principal executive officer of the Government of Burma, and the chief magistrate. His duties are many and varied, and he has wide statutory powers. He is responsible, broadly, for the good government of his charge and for the maintenance within it of peace and order. The District and Sessions Judge, whose duties extend over both criminal and civil courts in one or more Districts, exercises therein both the highest original jurisdiction and also appellate jurisdiction over both magistrates and civil judges. Above the posts of Deputy Commissioner and of District and Sessions Judge, respectively, there are higher posts for which an officer may be selected in the course of his service, TERMS OF APPOINTMENT Appointments will be made by the Secretary of State for Burma. While provision is made for the case in which an officer is able to serve under the Secretary of State for the full normal period, candidates are warned that their appointments under the Secretary of State will be liable to be terminated at any time on account of constitutional changes, subject to their being given 12 months' notice. CONDITIONS OF SERVICE Period of Probation —All recruits will be appointed on probation. At the end of one year, provided their service has been satisfactory, they will be confirmed in the Service, unless their period of probation is extended by the Secretary of State. Burman recruits under the age of 25 at the date of selection may be required to undergo a period of training at a residential University in the United Kingdom and to reach a qualifying standard in an examination at the conclusion thereof. . Where the period of this training is of sufficient duration and an appropriate degree course is available, tiie recruit may be required to obtain a University degree. Seniority —All recruits will be treated for purposes of seniority as though they had been appointed in the year in which they attained or attain the age of 23 and will be placed below officers appointed in15 that year before the suspension of recruitment. The seniority of war-service recruits inter se will be determined according to their age. Pay —Pay will be drawn by recruits from the date on which they begin their period of probation. It consists of basic.pay, which is payable monthly in rupees, and overseas pay, which is payable in rupees during the first four years of service and thereafter in sterling. Overseas pay is admissible only to officers of non-Asiatic domicile. Basic pay is regulated by a time-scale ranging from Rs. 450 per mensem to Rs, 2,250 per mensem.* Overseas pay ranges from Rs. 150 per mensem to £30 per mensem. The full time-scale is set out in Appendix I. Officers will be required to pass prescribed examinations within certain periods ; failure to pass these examina tions may affect the grant of increments. Posts above those of Deputy Commissioner and of District and Sessions Judge carry rates of pay which are considerably higher than the maximum of the time-scale. The stage at which recruits will enter the time-scale will be determined according to their age, as follows :— Age at date of beginning probation Stage of time-scale Under 24 Over 24 but under 25 Over 26 but under 26 Over 26 but under 27 Over 27 but under 28 Over 28 but under 29 Over 29 but under 30 1st year 2nd year 3rd year 4th year 5th year 6th year 7th year Pay on the senior time-scale is drawn by officers on promotion either in an acting or substantive capacity to certain posts graded as ' superior posts ' and carrying greater responsibilities. Leave —Leave is calculated in terms of leave on average pay, at the rate of 5/22nds of the period spent on duty in the case of officers of non-Asiatic domicile and 2/llths in the case of officers of Asiatic domicile. Only a portion of the leave so calculated may be taken on average pay; the remainder is convertible into leave on half average pay for twice the period. Leave is accumulated and may be taken at intervals during service. It cannot be claimed as of right, but is given or refused at the discretion of Government. Passages —In addition to a free passage to India or Burma on first appointment, an officer of non-Asiatic domicile is entitled, on confirmation in the Service, to a credit in a passage account equiva lent to the cost of four return passages between Bombay and London at P. &amp; O 1st Class B rates. A similar credit is admissible for his wife, if he is married at the date of his appointment, or a proportion ate credit if he marries later. A credit of the cost of a single passage is * The present exchange value of the rupee is Is. 6d. Rs. 1,000 per mensem is equal to ^900 per annum.16 admissible for each of his children up to the age of 12 in the case of a male child and up to the age of 21 in the case of a female if still unmarried. Subject to the Passage Regulations, the officer is entitled to receive during his service passages for himself and for his family within the amounts of these credits. If he prefers to do so he can travel at a cheaper rate and so increase the number of journeys he can make at Government expense. These arrange ments may be modified if it becomes possible eventually to introduce a scheme for leave with journeys by air. Provision for Retirement— Appointments will not be pension able. During his service under the Secretary of State an officer will have the right to retire voluntarily at any time after completing five years' service and will be entitled to the retirement grant appropriate to the length of his service as shown in the second column of the table in Appendix II. If an officer's services are terminated on account of ill-health, he will receive either the retire ment grant appropriate to his length of service or the commutation value, calculated on an age plus state of health basis, of the invalid pension admissible under the Civil Service Regulations to a pension able officer of the same length of service, whichever is the greater. If as a result of constitutional changes an officer's appointment under the Secretary of State is terminated and he does not receive and accept an offer to continue to serve under government in Burma, he will be entitled to the grant appropriate to his length of service as shown in the third column of the table in Appendix II. It is, how ever, hoped that many of the officers whose appointments under the Secretary of State are terminated will be invited and will be willing to continue to serve under government in Burma. In such cases the grants appropriate to their length of service under the Secretary of State will be placed to their credit with an independent authority and will be paid to them on their leaving the service of government in Burma, or to their heirs if they die while still serving. The conditions for the continuance of their service under government in Burma will be for settlement by the Government of Burma. Provident Fund— Officers will be required to contribute to a Provident Fund. Provision for Widows— The widow of an officer dying in service will receive a grant equal to that to which at the date of his death her husband would have been entitled on voluntary retirement.17 SECTION 7. BURMA POLICE (CLASS I) DUTIES In the early years of his service an officer of the Burma Police (Class 1) serves as an Assistant to a District Superintendent of Police and, after a few years of service in this capacity, is posted to the charge of the Police of a District. The District Superintendent of Police is the right-hand man of the Deputy Commissioner in all that concerns the maintenance of public tranquillity and the control of crime; It is his duty to keep the Deputy Commissioner fully informed of all matters affecting law and order in the District. He is at the same time the executive head of the District Police Force and directly responsible for all ' matters relating to its internal economy, training and management, for the maintenance of its discipline and the efficient performance of all its preventive and executive duties. Above the posts of District Superintendent there are a number of higher posts for which an officer may be selected. TERMS OF APPOINTMENT As for Burma Civil Service (Class 1). CONDITIONS OF SERVICE Period of Probation —All recruits will be appointed on probation, and will be required within two years to pass prescribed depart mental examinations, after passing which they will be confirmed in the Service. The period of probation may not be extended beyond ■ two years except with the consent of the Secretary of State. Seniority —Recruits will be treated for purposes of seniority as though they had^been appointed in the year in which they attained or attain the age of 21 and will be placed below direct recruits appointed in that year before the suspension of recruitment. The seniority of ' war service ' recruits inter se will be determined according to their age. Pay —Pay will be drawn by recruits from the date on which they begin their period of probation. It consists of basic pay, which is payable monthly in rupees, and overseas pay, which is payable in rupees during the first four years of service and thereafter in sterling. Overseas pay is admissible only to officers of non-Asiatic domicile. Basic pay is regulated by a time-scale ranging from Rs. 359 per mensem to Rs. 1,350 per mensem. Overseas pay ranges from Rs. 100 per mensem to £30 per mensem. The full time-scale is set out in Appendix III. A number of higher posts, which are filled by selection, carry special rates of pay considerably above the maximum of the time-scale.18 The stage at which recruits will enter the time-scale will be determined according to their age, as follows :— Age at date of beginning probation Stage of time-scale Under 22 Over 22 but under 23 Over 23 but under 24 Over 24 but under 25 Over 26 but under 26 Over 26 but under 27 Over 27 but under 28 1st year 2nd year 3rd year 4th year 5th year 6th year 7th year Leave —As for Burma Civil Service (Class 1).

BURMA FRONTIER SERVICE DUTIES The Burma Frontier Service is, as its name implies, a Service whose members are appointed to posts in certain frontier districts of Burma, notably the Shan States, the Chin Hills, and the Myitkyina District. At the beginning of his service a Burma Frontier Service Officer, after a period of training, is posted to the charge of a Sub- Division either in the Shan States or in one of the frontier districts and is styled an Assistant Superintendent. His work varies with the area to which he is posted. In the Shan States it is likely to be mainly that of supervision. In his Sub-Division there may be one or more Chiefs, and the internal administration of the States is left largely to the Chiefs themselves, the Assistant Superintendent being there to help and advise the Chief and to submit reports to his superior officers. Outside the Shan States the duties of an Assistant Superintendent vary from those of a Headquarters Assistant at the Headquarters of a frontier District to the charge of a Sub-Division in the Hills. In these Sub-Divisions he has more direct contact with the people than in the Shan States, since there is less administration through the Chiefs. Above the rank of Assistant Superintendent there are several higher posts for which an officer may be selected. TERMS OF APPOINTMENT Candidates will be appointed and their conditions of service will be regulated by the Governor of Burma acting in his discretion. This means that no authority lower than the Governor will exercise control over their conditions of service. While provision is made for the case in which an officer is able to serve for the full normal period, candidates are warned that they must not regard this as a certainty and that their appointments under the Governor acting in his discretion will be liable to be terminated at any time on account of constitutional changes, subject to their being given 12 months' notice. CONDITIONS OF SERVICE Period of Probation —All recruits will be appointed on probation for two years. At the end of that period, provided their service has been satisfactory, they will be confirmed in the Service, unless their period of probation is extended. Seniority —Recruits will be treated for purposes of seniority as though they had been appointed in the year in which they attained or attain the age of 23 and will be placed below recruits appointed in that year before the suspension of recruitment. The seniority of ' war service ' recruits inter se will be determined according to their age. Pay —Pay will be drawn by recruits from the date on which they begin their period of probation. It consists of basic pay which is20 payable monthly in rupees, and overseas pay which is payable in rupees during the first four years of service, and thereafter in sterling. Overseas pay is admissible only to officers of non-Asiatic domicile. Basic pay is regulated by a time-scale ranging from Rs. 400 per mensem to Rs. 1,350 per mensem.* Overseas pay ranges from Rs. 100 per mensem to £30 per mensem. The full time-scale is set out in Appendix VI. All officers will be required to pass prescribed examinations within certain periods ; failure to pass these examinations may affect the grant of increments. Posts above the rank of Assistant Superintendent carry rates of pay which are considerably higher than the maximum of the time-scale. The stage at which recruits will enter the time-scale will be determined according to their age, as follows :— Age at date of beginning Stage of probation time-scale Under 24 1st year Over 24 but under 25 2nd vear Over 25 but under 26 3rd vear Over 26 but under 27 4th vear Over 27 but under 28 5th vear Over 28 but under 29 6th year Over 29 but under 30 7th year Leave —As for Burma Civil Service (Class 1). Passages —As for Burma Civil Service (Class 1), Provision for Retirement —During his service under the Governor of Burma acting in his discretion an officer will have the right to retire voluntarily at any time after completing five years' service and will be entitled to the retirement grant appropriate to the length of his service as shown in the second column of the table in Appendix VII.

If as a result of constitutional changes an officer's appointment under the Governor acting in his discretion is terminated and he does not receive and accept an offer to continue to serve under government in Burma, he will be entitled to the grant appropriate to his length of service as shown in the third column of the table in Appendix VII. It is, however, hoped that many of the officers whose appointments are thus terminated will be invited and will be willing to continue to serve under govern ment in Burma. In such cases the grants appropriate to their length of service under the Governor acting in his discretion will be placed to their credit with an independent authority and will be * The present exchange value of the rupee is Is. 6d.
