I think that there is more to be said for Syud Majid’s view of his obligations than the memorandum of the Department seems to admit. 1 he two brothers, Majid and Thoweynee, were at variance as to the division of their father’s king dom. At the request of both parties, Lord Canning, the then Governor General of India, became arbi trator, and divided the inheritance; Zanzibar to Majid, and Muscat and 40,000 dollars to be paid yearly by Zanzibar to Thoweynee. Thoweynee was murdered by his own son Salim. 1 here is not a shadow of doubt as to the fact, which was not denied to me when in open Durbar 1 re ceived Salim’s own envoys, three Sheikhs and men of weight in Oman, and told them, in so many words, what I had heard. It is to be regretted that the Government of India should obscure the question by suggesting doubts which are wholly untenable, and w hich no living soul acquainted with the facts really entertains. Majid, Sultan of Zanzibar, and a younger brother, Toorkee, who was in Oman, both became, by Arab custom, bound to avenge Thoweynee’s death, by killing Salim, and either could have done it, for either would have had the support of the whole of the Oman population, which was not tainted with Wahabeeism. But we actively inter fered to prevent either of them from ridding their country and their family of the parricide. We took Toorkee and carried him off as a prisoner, and only released him on his,parole not to attack Muscat by sea. (A 7 .^.—The Arabs of Oman, a very different race from either Bedowees or Nejdees, though possibly, like many other polygamous races, less scrupulous than monogamous races in shedding the blood of more distant relatives, have quite as great a horror as we have of parricide. Salim’s crime is always spoken of in Oman, when men dare speak at all of it, as an unheard of and unparalleled atrocity, and we have greatly lost in character by our apparent indifference to his crime.) Majid now says, “ I am bound, by every conside- “ ration binding on an Arab ruler, to go to war “ with Salim, and avenge my brother’s blood. If “ you prevent me by force, as you have already “ prevented Toorkee, from ridding our family and “ our country of this monster, I, like Toorkee, must ‘‘ bow to sueprior force, but I will not willingly go “ on paying to my brother’s murderer what I agreed '* to pay to my brother as the price of peace, and “ of an equitable division of our inheritance.” I think he has both natural and diplomatic right on his side. 9638 6 . AWhen kings differ the natural solution of their difference is war. If for our own convenience, and for the better prosecution of our buying and selling, we interfere between two rulers, as we have done twice in these last ten years, and stop war, we are clearly bound to settle all quarrels which, but for our interference, would he settled by appeal to the sword. lo my mind, it would be perfectly monstrous to use force to compel Zanzibar to pay the 40,000 dollars, unless we either adjudicated this new cause of quarrel arising out of Thoweynee’s murder, and punished the murderer, if found guilty, or left the uncle and nephew at liberty to settle the question, as to the guilt of Salim, by appeal to arms. No Arab will ever be deceived by the arguments now used by the Government of India ; and we shall only confirm the suspicion the Arabs have begun to entertain, that, for some selfish object of our own we secretly approve of Salim’s crime, and desire to profit by it. loss ot honour, satisfy Salim without further out- ragmg Thoweynee, would be by paying Salim our selves. This seems to me to be the logical conse quence of the course we have adopted in interfering to keep Salim on the throne, and the only course by which we can avoid further wrong-doing and disgrace. Probably, if we agreed to do this, Zanzibar would consent to some fresh and more effectual arrange ments for abolishing the slave trade, and there can be no doubt that, as a mere question of money, it 7n n 6 WOrth 0Ur while to P a y milch more than 40,000 dollars per annum for any agreement which won d f'nable us to reduce our squadron now em- Afnca SUpi)re8s slaver y on the east coast of -i• r» , ~—r*'' m nay tnucn mon a life grant to Syud Majid.

Complete separation of interests and obli tmns.as regards both Muscat and Z (*.) The Government of India to pay veariv Muscat the sum now due from Zanzib * I mention these officers because they are intimately acquainted with the whole subject, and are personally known to every one of the parties affected by the treaty, and enjoy their confidence.3 *N.B. This neces sity can only be postponed, and its cost lessened, it cannot be entirely obviated. (c.) Muscat and Zanzibar to agree to effective arrangements to stop the slave trade, and to prevent a revival of piracy. (rf.) Zanzibar to receive such further payment from the Government of India as our Envoy may find to be reasonable, as a set for the loss of slave labour. This pay ment to continue for one or two genera tions, as may be found equitable. (e.) The charge of such arrangements to be be divided between India and England, as a reasonable payment for lessening to India* the cost of resuscitating a local navy for the Persian Gulf, and for enabling England to reduce the East African squadron. I believe, by some such plan, we might stop the slave trade as effectually on the east, as has been done on the west, coast of Africa, and content both Zanzibar and Muscat, without paying heavily for the attainment of both those great objects. As to the Persian Gulf and Persia’s share in these disputes, I would defer action till such an officer as Captain Lynch has visited Teheran, as proposed in the departmental Memorandum, and can tell us distinctly what Persia wants to do in the Gulf, and how, and why. M e must remember that Persia, thwarted and overridden on every possible occasion, to the north and north-east by Russia, and on the Turkish fron tier, is glad of any opportunity to fancy herself independent towards Khorassan and the seaboard. In this she is encouraged by Russia, whose interests are equally served whether Persia makes way or gets snubbed by the English in those directions. 1 his plan of a navy in the Gulf may be either a plaything of the Shah’s, or a serious effort, such as from time to time is suggested by some of the more intelligent Persian ministers to strengthen their position, but it can in no way diminish our neces sities or obligations as a naval power in these seas. If two men like Sir William Coghlan and Captain Lynch were to report, the one from the Persian, the other from the Muscat, point of view, we should know more exactly what it may be best to do in the way of advising or aiding Persia as to getting up a navy for herself in the Indian seas. On the general question, I cannot add much to what I have often said, in one form or another, to the Governor General and Secretary of State, e.g., in a letter to Sir J. Lawrence, of the 23d March 1866, of which and of other correspondence on the subject extracts are annexed. It is difficult, if not impossible, now to retrace the false steps we then took, and since have taken, in recognizing Salim, and thrice interfering when we prevented I oorkee and Majid from opposing Salim, and actively aided Salim to suppress the tribes of Oman who had revolted against him. All we can now do is to prevent making more mistakes of the same kind.4 Time presses; and what is now to be done cannot be well deferred. But the only plan which seems to me likely to enable us permanently to maintain the position w r e have held in the Arabian seas for so many years past, is that which was proposed by Sir G. Clerk to Lord Canning, to have a Governor of Aden, as we have of Malta and Gibraltar, ap pointed by the Indian Government, but corre sponding direct with the Secretary of State, as the Governors of Madras and Bombay do, and having Assistants with political and consular powers, much as at present, but reporting to Aden from Zanzibar, Jeddah, and Muscat. The Agencies at Bushire and Bagdad should, in like manner, report to the Minister at 1 ehran, who should be an Indian Officer selected by Her Majesty’s advisers from among the men qualified for the posts of Lieutenant Governors, Chief Com missioners, and the higher grades of political officers. I think this would be a better field for selection than is afforded by the less favoured attaches of the Turkish and Persian missions. I would pay the whole cost of these arrangements from India, but there is no reason why all the Persian correspondence which relates to Luropean foreign affairs should not come before Her Majesty’s Government through the Foreign Office, as at present, while, as regards purely Indian affairs, the the Minister corresponded direct with the Viceroy, the Governor of Bombay, or the Secretary of State for India, as the case might require. Just as, for the last century and more, the Ad miral in the Mediterranean has had as much diplo matic as naval correspondence, without leading to any misunderstanding between the Admiralty and Foreign Office. In dealing with all these questions, we must not forget— (1.) That all our interests with Persia, Arabia, and East Africa are primarily Indian interests. (2.) That the Indian interests in those countries are not modern, but reach back to the ages of the ancient Persian, Assyrian, and Egyptian dynasties. (3.) That the most modern feature in our rela tions is the very serious interruption to trade in those seas for more than a century, caused by the increase of piracy, which was consequent on the decay of the modern Ottoman, Persian, and Mogul empires, and in which oiir own countrymen, with the Dutch and Portuguese, 150 to 200 years ago, unhappily set the example. (4.) That the Indian trading communities now found in almost every port on those coasts had been there from time immemorial, when Vasco de Gama first rounded the Cape, and that we cannot now, either safely or honourably, repudiate our obli gations as the rulers of the country of which they are natives and to which they owe allegiance. (N.B .—These traders very rarely take their5 families with them, and still more rarely settle. Their legal domicilium is always at ports of Western India, 1 atta or K.urrachee in Jbind, in various towns of Cutch and Kattywar, Bombay, or Calicut.) (5.) we have, by treaty and long usage, an almost exclusive right of interference with nearly half the Arabian seaboard, and that we have, up to the present time, actively enforced those rights. The Indian Government* in former days, under Lords Wellesley, Hastings, William Bentinck, and Auckland, sent embassies and expeditions, fought at Ras-el-Khyma, bombarded Mocha, occupied Kar- rack, and took Aden, to maintain our position; and no Government of India, up to three years ago, ever dreamed of repudiating our powers and responsi bilities in those seas. , (6.) That France, America, and Russia are all most anxious for a footing on these coasts. France sent Mr. Gifford Palgrave “ to look for an island,” and the French Commodore now in those seas has, I have every reason to believe, an eye to the de velopment of that idea. The operations of Prussia and America, with a similar object in view, are in abeyance while their hands are so full at. home, but they are never concealed or denied by Americans or Germans interested in the east, nor is there any thing for Americans or Germans to be ashamed of, or to be regretted by us, in their prosecution. But it is quite certain that wherever we recede from the position we have so long held, one of these powers will step in. We shall not annihilate our interest and responsibilities in Persian Gulf and Arabian affairs. We shall simply transfer them from the Indian authorities, to whom they tra ditionally belong, and who do understand, or ought to understand, them, and who can manage them economically, and we shall make them over to the Foreign Office, who will not, and cannot, know much about them, or give them much real atten tion, until some question arises which assumes the aspect of a European complication, the solution of which will cost millions. (7.) That Russia is passive in Southern Persia and Arabia, because whatever happens must work to her advantage. Russia well knows that nothing will induce us to attempt extending our Empire at the expense of Persia, Affghanistan, or Turkey, and that all three Empires must gravitate towards the aggressive powers, which are at present Russia and France.- If we prop up Turkey and Persia, and help them, as we do now, to develop trade, and to become richer, so much more valuable will be the prize when it comes to be shared. Meantime, we keep out French and Americans, and other less peacefully disposed powers. In promoting our own peaceful views we are doing the work of Russia, and if we were, instead of a telegraphic line, to make a railway from Tiflis to Bushire, Russia would hardly object. It would aid her to sit astride of 9638 b. B6 Persia, with one foot in the Caspian sea and the other in the Persian Gulf, and she knows that, till she puts her foot in the stirrup, we shall not wish ourselves to mount into that saddle. Russia is equally well assured that we do not wish to weaken, or to keep weak, either Turkey or Persia. But if our action, or inaction, has that effect, the ultimate result is the same to the in terests of Russia, which cannot help being an aggres sive power as long as its neighbours are weaker and less civilized than itself. (8.) That we cannot devolve on either Persia, Turkey, or Muscat, or on any two, or all of them combined, our obligations and responsibilities to suppress piracy, and to do what is essential to prevent its revival by arbitrating between hostile tribes. The piratical tribes of the Persian Gulf coasts have never owned, and probably never will own, allegiance to any other power, whether Arab, Turk, or Persian. We have treaty engagements with them, into which they entered partly because we brought an overwhelming force against them, but more because they found that we really did not wish, as all Arab, Tur k, and Persian potentates do, for territorial aggrandisement. We simply desired that they should keep the peace at sea, and render the seas safe for trade. r l hese treaties are solemn engagements, made many years ago, and acted on ever since, until quite lately, when we have been slack in doing our part, partly because the Government of India enunciated a perfectly new view of its own inten tions and responsibilities, and partly because the ships of the Royal Navy cannot be left in the Gulf during the hot season, as the ships of the old Indian Navy used to be, at the call of the Resident. 11 Muscat nad a really good navy (as she had few years ago, in the lifetime of Syud Saeed, th father of Thoweynee • and Majid), it would, c course, help in many ways to discourage piracj but it could not suppress it, and Muscat, withou the revenues of Zanzibar, could hardly now main tam such a navy. No naval force which Persia or Turkey coul organize would be of any use in putting dow: piracy, because Turks and Persians would alway attempt territorial conquest, and thus rouse th hostility of the pirate tribes to an extent whicl would aggravate the evil. Piracy in these seas is no modem evil. It ha been, off and on, the main occupation of warlik tribes, on a barren and unhealthy coast, for man ' les ;, Tl ' c strength of the tribes consists, no only n their fierce, fanatical, courage, hut in th rfw t- ’ ea f ™. health y climate, and dangerou *w n f thelr coa8t ’ which makes it almos impossible for any civilized foreign Power con tinuously to hold territorial possession of the whol25 eg) 7 Hence, the suppression of piracy depends on the constant use of a naval force of small armed vessels, sufficiently strong to coerce any one tribe, or even all of them combined, but used only to enforce treaty engagements, or just arbitration under treaty. Our Indian navy did all that was required, with from four to eight small sailing vessels,—the largest, a small 20-gun sloop of war,— and a steamer or two, always present in the Gulf. This small force sufficed, because the tribes knew we had no ulterior objects, and had no designs on their territorial independence, and were generally, in a rough way, just and reasonable. Had they been suspicious of our motives, a much larger force would have been needed. Three (3) small, well-armed steamers, of which two could be always in the Gulf, would be ample to do the same work now, and to prevent a revival of piracy; but they must be small, to work on a shore masked by a network of coral reefs, with deep channels between. They must be well manned and armed, for an Arab boat, with 50 to 100 men on board, would never hesitate to board a vessel double her own tonnage, and, once on the decks, the Arab pirates, with sword and dagger, and thorough contempt for life, are formidable customers, even to well-armed English sailors. This work cannot be done by Her Majesty’s ships under existing Admiralty regulations, nor will the Admiralty ever allow any permanent exceptional relaxation of their rules in any one sea. The best course open to us in these seas seems to me to be : — 1. To have an Indian Commodore,—a young, active, Post Captain,—to command the war vessels of the Indian Government, under the orders of the Viceroy, and paid by the Indian Government. 2. He should have at least three small, well- manned and well-armed steamers, for ser vice in the Persian Gulf, and he should command all the other marine of the Indian Government. 3. His Officers and European seamen should be volunteers from Her Majesty’s Navy, lent to the Indian Government for five (5) years at a time, without prejudice to their pro spects or promotion in the Royal Navy, and subject to recal when wanted by the Admiralty. 4. Legislation will be requisite to give the Com modore proper authority under Her Ma jesty’s Commission. All hands should be subject to his orders, as they are, in Her Majesty’s ships, to the orders of the Admiral, but he should be subject to the authority of the Viceroy and Indian Government only, the Indian Treasury paying all expenses. H. B. Frere. July 15th, 18G8.78 P.S. to Memorandum on Muscat and Zanzibar Affairs. I omitted one consideration of great importance in dealing with the questions aifecting the naval force required in the Persian Gulf and Arabian Seas, viz., that the necessity for a large naval force, always present, will be much diminished as the use of steamers for carrying on the coasting trade increases. A coasting steamer, especially if running at regular intervals, has, directly and indirectly, a great effect in checking piracy, A steamer is itself, as every sailor knows, much safer from attack by sailing vessels or rowing boats, and more difficult to cut off, than a sailing ship. Mail steamers have also the same indirect effect on robbery by &gt; sea that made roads and regular mail coaches have on highway robbery by land. They give the earliest information of insecurity, and any irregularity immediately attracts notice. They also have a great effect in giving regular employment to the boatmen, &amp;c., at the petty ports on the coasts, in the intervals of the pearl-diving and other fishing seasons, without taking them far from their homes. This removes one of the great inducements to piracy among the inhabitants of a coast so barren that agricultural industry is almost precluded. I have no doubt that the steamers now regularly running from Bombay to Busra have greatly con duced to discourage a revival of piracy since the Indian naval squadron was withdrawn; and I believe that the extension and greater frequency of steamer transit along the coasts of Arabia and East Africa would tend greatly to check slavery, as well as piracy, for there can be no doubt that slavery is a congenial alternative occupation, to which the piratical tribes turn when they find their ancestral occupation of robbing infidel merchants and usurers on the high seas checked by the Kaffir men-of-war. In the extracts from my demi-official correspond ence with the Viceroy regarding Muscat, I have endeavoured to confine myself to what relates to general principles, though it is very difficult, without reference to details and particulars, as examples, to support the very strong view I enter tain of the utter impossibility of working the present system. The circumstances are such as to require that, whenever occasion arises for active operations, the representative of the British Government should be sufficiently acquainted with the past and present history of his charge, and with the views of his Government, to act at once, and that he should have the means of doing what is necessary, without loss of time. For the ordinary season for field service, without risk to European lives, which in India is reduced by the heat of the weather to eight months, is in the Persian Gulf not more than four. . ,i'9 Under the most favourable circumstances, it is now impossible for the Resident in the Gulf to get an answer from India under six weeks, and four months would, I believe, be more nearly the average. Persian Gulf politics are not likely to be familiar to Indian statesmen, unless they have been espe cially studied, and a Viceroy is peculiarly ill-situated for obtaining information relating to naval matters when at Simla, where he can only by the merest accident meet any one who has any practical know ledge of or interest in naval affairs or commerce, especially in the Seas of Western India. In all these respects, the Secretary of State in London is infinitely better off than any Viceroy can be at Simla. Even Bombay is inconveniently distant for controlling the Resident, unless he fully understands what the Government intend and wish, and enjoys their entire confidence, so that he can act promptly on a known policy, without waiting for orders; and I feel convinced that any attempt to substitute a system of minute report and reference for instruc tions from Calcutta or Simla, before action, must end in perpetual blunders and failures. The Resident should continue to be a trusted and intelligent representative, not a clerk in leading strings. Any attempt to put him in the latter position will lead to failures and cross purposes, numerous and serious in proportion to the length of the leading strings. The evil will be greater if it is attempted to pull the strings from Bombay, and greater still if from Calcutta or Simla. The consequences of the present system are worse than complete paralysis of all useful action. Abso lute inaction in dealing with a semi-civilized, igno rant, and fanatical people is often dangerous, but action on such people, through a mistrusted agent, directed four months after the events contemplated, by a distant and ill-informed absolute Government, is* worse than mischievous; it is ridiculous, and almost certain to produce results the opposite of what was intended. In the present case, with the best intentions of not interfering in the internal affairs of Muscat, we have thrice, in two years, turned the scale, and always in the direction opposite to that which our interests, our obligations, and our intentions indi cated. We have recognized and bolstered up a parricide, actively checked his relations who would have deposed him; we have made one uncle a prisoner and deported him, and threatened another with blockade, if he exercised his undoubted rights, as an independent sovereign, to punish his nephew ; and, finally, we have supplied our parricidal protege with funds to break up a confederacy of the tribes of Oman, who had risen in rebellion to depose him. It is true we did not contemplate any of these results, but they have all been produced by our agency and influence, in spite of our intentions. The circumstances which led to my letter of the 23d of March 1866 were briefly these :— The Wahabees, and pirate tribes instigated by 9638 b . Cthem, in the course of their aggressions against Muscat, had cruelly put to death, in cold blood, several Hindoo traders, non-combatant British subjects, living and trading in Muscat territory. Colonel Pelly, the British Resident in the Persian Gulf, consequently not only urged the Government of Muscat to repel and punish the aggressors, but asked the Officer commanding Her Majesty's ship “ Highflyer ” to aid with the ships under his command. In attacking the small fort of Demaun, near Khatiff, the boats of the “Highflyer” were repulsed, with the loss of four men killed, and several wounded. The Sultan of Muscat was, about the same time, treacherously assassinated by his son Salim, who had become imbued with Wahabee doctrines, and who, in the absence of the army and its Com mandant, his uncle Toorkee, and of the British Resident, succeeded in seizing the palace, the capital, and such treasure and military stores as they contained. On these circumstances being reported, the Government of India expressed a general disap proval of all that had been done by the Resident. I have not at hand the demi-official letter which thd Viceroy wrote at the same time, but it was very much to the same effect as his later letter of April 21st, extracts from which will be found below. The following letter, dated Bombay, March 23d, 1866, contains the views which I submitted to the Viceroy in reply :— “ I have been very carefully thinking over what you say about Muscat affairs in your letter to me of the 12th, as well as in the official Despatch, and there are one or two points on which I am afraid I can hardly agree with you. “ The repulse at Demaun was certainly very annoying, and the loss of the four brave fellows killed a very lamentable and, it may be said, a very useless expenditure of valuable life. But, in appor tioning the blame, I think you should consider that the season for naval operations was drawing to a close; that the Admiralty peremptorily forbade the retention of ships in the Gulf after the hot weather set in; and that, if the navy was to do anything, it was necessary to do it quickly. “ Of course, if Colonel Pelly had been on board [the “ Highflyer,”] the information would have been better, the reconnoitring more complete, and the attack would probably have succeeded, with, pos sibly, no loss ; but is Colonel Pelly to blame for not going with the “ Highflyer ” ? “ I certainly think not. He could not be in two places at once, and he was much more wanted at Muscat and with the Sultan than up the Gulf. The naval operations were merely auxiliary; the main object was to rouse the Sultan to use his own very2 7 (S» 11 &lt;iTiiple forces liy land to repel the Wahabee aggres sion. This Colonel Felly could not do unless he kept close to the Sultan. He did stay close to him, and did rouse him, and would have made him do for himself all that was needed had not his parricide soon cut him off, by a crime which no one could foresee, and which was so improbable in itself that the poor Sultan, when warned by a faithful slave, refused to believe it possible. “ Colonel Felly is, I believe, the first Resident who ever stirred from Bushire except on a holiday trip. He has done his best by personal activity and exertion to make up for the want of a more numerous Agency, and has almost literally carried his life in bis hand, in visiting, not only all the shores of the Gulf, but in his most perilous journey to Riadh, and this year in his trip through Oman. “ His predecessors had always at their beck and call a squadron, never less than two, and usually three or four, well armed ships of war of the Indian Navy, generally one of them a steamer, with their head quarters at Bassadore, in the Gulf. If any thing was to be done, and hardly a year passed without a brush or demonstration of some kind, one or two of these vessels were sent, and the show of force was usually sufficient to overawe opposition. “ Colonel Felly has nothing of the kind. He has one small worn out steamer, which he dare not arm lest he should give her an unequivocal character as a pirate, and on which, owing to legal difficulties long since laid before the Government of India with our prayer for relief by legislation, he can neither hoist a pennant as man-of-war, nor enforce disci pline under the Merchant Seaman’s Act. He has no authority over any man-of-war which may chance to come up ; he must catch one, as he can, and can only advise, request, and suggest. “ The position is a most difficult one, and I am quite certain the present system cannot last. If any man could have worked it, I believe Felly would, for he is on the best of terms with the navy, and his personal character and manner prevent the Chiefs, as far as it is possible to prevent them, from noticing the absence of the force in ships and men of the Indian Navy, which were always ready to back his predecessors, and of which former Residents gene rally made a rather ostentatious display. “ In sending his Native Agent with the “ High flyer,” Colonel Felly did the utmost he could, and that at great personal inconvenience and conside rable risk to himself. He advised Captain Fasley . to go vid Bahrein, where he would have got any pilots and information he could require, and had he done this, and reconnoitered with ordinary caution, he would either not have attacked the port at all, or ensured its capture and destruction with little risk of loss. “ Do I then blame Captain Pasley and his officers for their rashness ? I should be very sorry to do anything ot the kind. No doubt the thing might have been better and more prudently managed, 0 so12 as to ensure success and avoid loss, and with older men we should not have had to regret the morti fying repulse, and the sad loss of four such fine fellows ; but they attempted an impossibility in a most gallant and dashing fashion, and were repulsed without disgrace. The next time the survivors have anything of the kind to do, every man who was in those boats will know how to set about it, and will succeed, unless the spirit be preached out of them by our official lectures on their rashness. “ Of course, what they did was very rash, but so are all stormings and boardings and cuttings out. It is owing to such rashness, joined to other great qualities, that our navy is what it is. We should have thought them very fine fellows if they had succeeded, and I trust the Admiralty will not think the worse of them for having honourably failed in an enterprise so desperate that few but British sailors would have attempted it, and in which none could have been defeated with so little disgrace. “ As to the tone of Colonel Felly’s letters to the Wahabee Ameer, and the shortness of the time allowed for compliance with the demand for com pensation, I was at first inclined to agree with you that the letters were too peremptory and the time allowed too short. I wrote in this sense to Colonel Felly. «« But, on reconsideration, I felt inclined to trust much to his personal knowledge of the people he was dealing with, and I think the event proves he was right. The Ameer, or whoever writes in his name, clearly thought it best to knuckle down. He immediately accepted Colonel Felly s offer to mediate, and has sent envoys to Khatiff to discuss the terms. These offers of mediation are the same which the Ameer, in September, treated with contemptuous silence, and I think it very questionable whether they w T ould now have received such respectful attention had Felly’s letter been milder in tone or his demand more moderate. “ But the main question is, whether we have any business there at all ? and here I am not sure that I quite concur in the view you take of our duties and responsibilities on that coast. “ Of course, if by taking the consequences of living ‘ in such a country ’ is meant taking all the consequences to which the native subjects of the ruler are liable, I agree, as far as the treatment of our subjects by that ruler is concerned, the cases are exceptional in w hich we could reasonably expect . him to treat our people better than he does his own ; and our people, if they go there, must take their chance of such uncertainty of life, liberty, and pro perty as is the natural and usual characteristic of such Governments, and the hereditary misfortune of all their subjects. “ But in the present case the Ruler of Muscat was not in fault, further than that in not defending his own people he had exposed our subjects, along with his own, to the outrages of a third power. “ What is our duty in such a case? Here we had13 1 ? a treaty of alliance with Muscat. But even without any treaty, should we be justified in standing aloof, and saying to our subjects, ‘ You went there for gain, and we cannot undertake to protect you/ We should hardly act thus in Belgium, if a French invading General were to fine and murder our merchants. “ Surely if we found Belgium unable to resist unprovoked aggression, or to defend our people who had gone there to trade, we should be much dis posed to make common cause with the injured party, and, if remonstrance and offers of mediation were ineffectual, we should consider we had a quarrel to settle, on our own account, with the invaders, and if we stopped short of war it would not be because we lacked fair cause, in that our peaceful subjects, known to be such, had been plundered and murdered, not in the course of warlike operations, but in cold blood, because they were rich, and because they were subjects of the British Government. “ But our case against the Wahabees is infinitely stronger. We have treaties binding us to aid Mus cat, which I can only suppose were made in antici pation of a case like the present, for the Wahabees are the only enemy that Muscat has to fear, and for generations past we have been united with Muscat against this very Wahabee power. “ It is true that in 1834 we warned the Sultan of Muscat that he was not to expect aid from us if he got into a quarrel with the Wahabees. This was very necessary at the time, for the Wahabees were theu rather down in the world, only just recovering from that severe chastisement inflicted on them by Ibrahim Pacha and his Egyptian army. Muscat was prosperous, and rather aggressively inclined, and it was very necessary to prevent our being drawn in as allies in aggression on the Sultan’s neighbours in the interior of Arabia. “ No doubt our answer at that time had much influence in turning the Sultan’s attention to Zan zibar. His African kingdom grew up, and after his death we, acting as arbitrators, divided his pos sessions between his two sons, and entered into fresh relations with them. Meantime, we very effectually preserved the maritime peace of the Persian Gulf, and hardly a year has passed without our actively interfering in some way or another, arbitrating in quarrels between tribes, fining and punishing in various ways any of the littoral tribes who broke the peace. “ Perhaps the proceedings of our people were not always perfectly wise or just, but they were, on the whole, honestly intended and consistently carried out, to effect a definite object, the prevention of any revival of piracy, and they were fairly successful. Piracy did not revive, but trade did, and has of late made such progress as to surprise even the most sanguine. “ The enclosed returns show only a very small portion of this revival of the ancient maritime com merce of Northern Arabia and Persia with India, 9638 6. D lmmmm 15 But what are the risks of a revival of Wahabee piracy ? Is it not dead, and will it not remain so if we leave it alone ? “ I would answer, first, by referring to the past. Piracy, especially on the ships of idolatrous and usurious Hindoos, or of Christians and other Kaffirs, has been the sanctified amusement of these tribes for ages. Sindbad found them at it in the good days of Haroun-al-Raschid, and there are many men now alive who I have had relating that, in their own days, no unarmed vessel was safe from the attacks of pirates, Soorees, Joasmis,and Has el Khymerees, when trading between Bombay and Surat. “ Since 1824, the effect of Ibrahim Pacha’s cam paigns in Nedj, the Muscat operations on the coast, our own expeditions to punish some of the pirate nests, and the constant patrol of the sea by the vessels of the late Indian Navy, have made piracy impossible. “ So the old pirates took to slavery on the East Coast of Africa, and our Consuls at Zanzibar, Colonels Playfair and Rigby, as well as Pelly and Dr. Livingstone, or Captain Oldfield, or any intelli gent officer of the East Coast squadron, will tell you that the Soorees, Joasmis,and Ras el Khymerees are just as well known as the most active and desperate slavers now on the African coast, as they were famous as pirates 50 years ago on the coasts of Persia and Western India. “ Moreover, our anti-slavery operations in Eastern Africa have excited the most bitter animosity against us, but especially against our naval officers, through out the old pirate coast, and popular feelings every where would be in favour of a revival of piracy. “ For the last three years, since the abolition of the late Indian Navy, Colonel Pelly has managed to get on without any naval force in the Gulf, but no one knows better than your Excellency that this cannot go on for any length of time, and that when it is clearly seen that there is no material force at hand to punish the wrong-doer, there is no per manent security for the efficacy of moral force. “ You remember how Trevelyan objected to letting the Resident have even a steam yacht in place of the Indian Navy squadron of former days. “ Such a yacht might have done well enough as long as all went smoothly; but one such vessel will not suffice for the police of the Gulf, and I am equally certain that you cannot wash your hands of all responsibility for the police of the Gulf, nor pro vide for it by means of an occasional visit in the cool weather from a man-of-war, whose orders peremptorily forbid stay after the hot weather in April sets in. “ Nothing short of a formal written requisition from your Excellency in Council will justify the Commodore in leaving a single small vessel in the Gulf after April, nor will even that oblige any Officer up there to act as you wish, nor to comply with any requisition of the Resident, unless he, the Captain, agrees with him. 4116 “ In short, I am firmly convinced that other arrangements must be made for the ordinary mari time police of the Gulf, and that they must be made immediately, unless we would risk the massacre of the Hindoos, *. e., the bulk of the trading community at all the ports, and the interruption, with much loss of life and property, of the telegraph line. “ I will not trouble you with any of the various plans which have occurred to me for establishing such a police, unless you wish to have them ; but all would be less costly than the old Indian Navy, and more effective than our present reliance on men-of-war, which cannot remain more than a few cool weeks in those seas. “ We must bear in mind that this revival of Wahabeeism is only one undulation of the great disturbance to which most Mahomedans look forward in this or the coining year. I need not tell you that the mystical numbers of Daniel and the Apocalypse are discussed in many a mosque from Zanzibar to Bokhara, as well as in Dr. Cumming’s church, and in Arabic and Persian pastorals to the faithful, as well as in the Doctor’s little books, and with very much the same results, a conviction that some con vulsion is to shake Islam and many heretical Christian churches about this time ; 1867 is a date very usually given. “ You are more in the way of hearing of these things than I have been since leaving Sind ; but few weeks pass without my hearing or seeing some evidence that there is a general expectation among Mahomedans of something going to happen, and that, according to their information and views, they look forward with fear or hope to what the next year or two will bring forth. “No one knows better than your Excellency how these things affect a population like that on the shores of the Gulf. “ 28^4 March .—Since I began this letter I have seen Colonel Pelly and the Commodore, and the additional information they gave me has shown me little to add to or alter in what I had previously written. “ But 1 was sorry to find Colonel Pelly very sore at your criticism on his proceedings. He says he has repeatedly, within the last two years, risked his own life in the discharge of his duty, and to accom plish that which is usually done by a display of,—if not the use of,—force, and he feels keenly the im putation of having exceeded his instructions, and unnecessarily resorted to force when it seemed to him that a blow, promptly and decidedly struck against the aggressors on their peaceful neighbours, was the best mode of keeping the peace. “ I hope to send you his official answer in a few days. Meantime, he must return at once. He left ‘ all standing,’ as the sailors say, and the ‘ Panta loon’ going to the Gulf, on her way to the East African coast, affords the only chance of sending him up in a man-of-war, but he has neither the health nor the inclination to remain, unless he wereassured it was necessary for the good of the public service, in which case, as on many previous occa sions, he would postpone health, or life, or anything of the sort. “ But I do not see what is immediately to be done. J “ The parricide Salem reigns at present at Muscat. He is described as a rude, ill-conditioned, uneducated man, not naturally fitted to rule; and it is possible that he may be speedily set aside, either in favour of some other member of the same family, or by one of the many Chiefs of Oman, or by the Wahahees. At any rate, while he lives and rules, I do not suppose you will recognize him as the successor of our ally, nor have anything to say to him, as long as he does not meddle with us, or oppress our subjects more than he does his own. “ I conclude his usurpations puts an end to all our treaty obligations, and that, whether he estab lishes himself or is set aside, we are free as to any renewal of the friendly relations we had with his father and grandfather. “As to the Wahabees, the agents sent by the Ameer will probably have returned before Colonel Belly can reach Bushire. If not, I think he should tell them that matters have so much altered at Muscat since they were deputed to meet him, that he cannot discuss Muscat affairs further at present, beyond giving them a general exhortation to abstain from aggression, to discourage piracy, and keep quiet within their own territory. “ On his way up and down, Colonel Pelly will look in at Gwadur and Mussendom, and do what he can to allay the panic which, at the former station, prevailed up to a few days ago, with, as far as we could see, little immediate cause. “ But recent events furnish a strong additional reason for transferring the Mussendom station to the island of Anjam or Henjam, off the south coast of Kishm. Colonel Goldsmid knows all the argu ments in favour of the change. I really know none against it, and I quite agree with him as to the mode in which it should be effected, i.e., by negotiation with the Persian Government, which he would manage very well, if it were left to him. “ There will still remain the general question of the permanent maritime police of the Gulf, which cannot, I think, be postponed, for I am very certain that we must not rely on the ships of Her Majesty’s Navy for ordinary purposes, and that, unless some other agency be organized, we shall risk the peace of those seas, and not only check a great and growing commerce, but hazard our line of telegraph communication. “ This letter has grown so far beyond what I intended, that I will only add that I am sorry to say the ‘ Octavia’ has nearly 200 sick, and has lost the First Lieutenant and several men ; whether it is small-pox, taken hence by some men who have been in our wretched European Hospital, or 9638 b . Ewhether it is 1 Gulf fever,’ as they call it, though she did not enter the Gulf, seems doubtful. No one could do more than the Commodore does for the crew,—we have given up an island in the har bour to them as a quarantine station,—but it will not encourage the Admiralty to let their ships serve in these seas.” To this Sir John Lawrence replied, in a letter, dated Simlah, April 14th, 1861. “ I am sorry to find, from your letter of the 28th ultimo, that you think I have been in any w r ay hard on Colonel Pelly. I have certainly said less on this subject than I thought. It still seems to me that it was a mistake sending the “ Highflyer ” on her warlike mission, without being able to go with her, or send a competent English Officer in Colonel Felly’s place. “ As regards also the tone of Felly’s letters to theWahabee, it struck me as injudicious,and unlikely accomplish the object for which it was intended, and I would still deprecate so peremptory a style being used by British Officers. “ It is true, as you say, that the result would seem to show that he was right; but this does not appear to be conclusively shown. Without being behind the scenes, it is impossible to be certain what were the circumstances which induced the Wahabee Chief to meet his ultimatum in the pacific manner which has been adopted. “ In like manner, I consider that Colonel Pelly might with advantage have given the people more time than he did. by you to Colonel Pelly, but unless he was autho- rized to levy a sum of money from Soor as com pensation for the losses of the Hindoos at that place, and on failure to bombard the place, I should say that he ought not to have done this at all. I am sure that Colonel Pelly is zealous, energetic, and b ! lc spirited* still I think it would do him no harm if a^little caution was added to his good qualities. “ I was quite disposed to your view in the first instance, that we should not recognize Sultan Saleem, and indeed should break off all relations with mm, but, alter discussing the matter in Coun- C1 » ,' v r e . . co . me to the conclusion somewhat modifying this view, as you will find in the official letter from the Foreign Office. The course therein proposed will give time for us to see what turn affairs take at Muscat, and whether Sultan Salim can consolidate his power or not. British I? s | aids ‘l 16 P rotection we should afford to British Indian subjects residing in Muscat, and such cuit'ies' ‘ Th t0rlCS ’ t l le Sllb J ect is heset with diffi- an nlnn l o are &gt; 1 shoul(i ^y, maltreated and plundered at times, not because they are they areHind ’ bUt I’ 6 ™' 186 the y are ™h, because tMnir on H the d and ' tran e er8 in the some- 11 ° tlle same principal that Jews were con-BBS &amp;3Emxai 19 sidered as suitable objects of spoliation all over Europe in the middle ages. “ As I understand the subject, the majority of these Hindoos have been established in these countries for ages, quite independent of our connexion with their rulers. On the whole, the treatment of these people, cannot, I conceive, be really very bad, or the compensating advantages must be very considerable, or they would long ago have left the country. “ Such traders, however despised, manage to make friends and hold their own. This is the case, as you know, all over Central Asia, down to the very confines of British India. “ While, of course, I would do what I could to help and befriend the Hindoo traders in Muscat, Oman, and the Wahabee territory, that protection must, of necessity, be limited in extent and contingent on circumstances. I do not think that we should be ready to go to war to redress their injuries. “ As regards the police of the Gulf, my views, I believe, will be found not to be very different from your own. I incline to think that something must sooner or later be done. “ The great difficulty is to decide what this ought to be. Willoughby was always very strongly of opinion that it was very unwise doing away with the Indian Navy altogether; it was, in your lati tudes, to the ships in the Royal Navy, what our Native army is to the English troops in the interior of India, a necessary and useful adjunct. But, the Indian Navy is gone, and the question is, how we can supply a substitute. I think that we shall all, on this side, be quite ready to listen to any well devised, and not very expensive, project which you may bring forward.” In a subsequent letter, dated Bombay 13th April 18(16, I reported: — “ Colonel Pelly has returned to the Persian Gulf in the ‘ Pantaloon.’ I w ould have asked him to remain till we heard further from you, but the Wahabee envoys may be at Bushire, and if he did not appear they would not easily understand the reason. The ‘ Pantaloon/ too, cannot wait in these seas without infringing Admiralty orders, so I told him to go, and suggested his holding himself in readiness to join you at Simla, via Kurrachee and Mooltan, should you wish to see him. There is so much which it is difficult to write, and so easy to understand by oral discussion, that I believe an hour’s conversation with him would save you many hours’ reading and writing, and it is so much easier to instruct or to obey a man you have seen, that I feel sure it w ould be every way advantageous if you could see him, so if you will telegraph your orders either to me or to Colonel Pelly at Gwadur with a note ‘ to be forwarded to Mussendom or Bushire ot ‘ Colonel Pelly has left/ they shall be obeyed, and if you wish him to come he may be with you in less r\20 than three weeks from the date of his getting your message. “ We have no further news. I have seen Hajee Ahmed, the minister of the late Sultan, he confirms my previous impressions, that all will probably re main quiet for a time, but that first one then another outlying possession will set up for itself or drop off to Persia or the Wahabees, and that we must be prepared to take vigorous measures to repress any attempt to revive piracy.” In reply to my suggestion that Colonel Pelly should be invited to visit Simla, to confer with the Viceroy, Sir John Lawrence, in a letter dated Simla, April 21st 1860, observed:— “ I could not ask Colonel Pelly to come up to Simla, more particularly at such an inclement season of the year. If necessary, he might come across on my return to Calcutta. I do not, how ever, desire to arrange myself for the policy to be adopted in the Persian Gulf. I would prefer that all that was done was carried on either by or through your Government. What that policy is to be will mainly depend, no doubt, on the views of the autho rities at home. If I have any influence in that policy, I should advise that we interfere as little as may be practicable in the affairs of the Arab tribes on the sea board, and, of course, still less with those of the tribes in the interior of the country. I would be slow to take up the cause of natives of India or their descendants, who call themselves British subjects, for injuries received in the country, and where I did so, I would confine that interference, as a rule, to remonstrance. Unless we act in this way, we shall make enemies and not friends of these Arab tribes, and our interference will be misrepresented, mis understood, and when opportunity offers will be resented also. “ 1 would confine our labours, as a rule, to the suppression of piracy on the high seas. This seems to me quite as much as we can undertake with any ' advantage.” To these two letters I replied, in a letter dated Bombay, April 29th, 1866, which refers to the official Despatches received at the same time :— “ I am sorry you cannot ask Colonel Pelly to Simla, for a visit to Calcutta next season will hardly fulfil my object of enabling him to have the advantage of explaining his own views, and per sonally learning what are your wishes and orders. ‘ The fact is, that the official Despatches on Muscat and Persian Gulf affairs are so worded that it is very difficult to make out what it is desired we should do. “We are not to be friends with Syud Salim, but he is not to be affronted, nor is anything to be done which will prevent our being friends, if he estab-21 lishes his own power. We are to protect British interests, and, on no account, let the French or any foreign Power step into the place we have so long occupied as general protectors of commerce, but we are to let all who call themselves British subjects clearly understand that, if they go to Arabia to trade, they must do so at their own risk, and not look to us for protection. “ I must confess that, if I had nothing but these official letters to guide me, I should be sorely puzzled. The only thing quite clear is that, what ever may go wrong, there will be no one to blame but the unhappy Resident, who can quote nothing that seems like an order without coming across something that seems intended as the antidote, warning him against the very same thing, and leaving him only to be blamed if anything goes wrong. “ With the advantage of your own letters before me,—an advantage which Colonel Pelly does not possess,—I can understand clearly enough your own views. But you must forgive me for saying that it will be impossible to carry them out without a total reversal of our policy of the last half century in these parts. “ The policy of non-interference which you de scribe might have been a very convenient one two generations ago, as it would have been in China or Japan, in Turkey or Egypt. “ But for the last 45 years at least our policy, from Bahrein to Ras-el-Had, has been one of active interference, and avowed assumption of the duty and responsibility of protecting general commerce. Trade has greatly increased, not less, I believe, than fourfold in 40 years. It has been generally under the British flag, and carried on by men who claimed protection as British subjects, and received it from the Resident, who had always an efficient squadron at his command, and used it very freely to enforce his demands. “ This system has been popular even with the Arabs themselves. They begin to find commerce profitable, and though you cannot convert pirates into merchants in one generation, much is being done to reclaim them. They look with dread, so Syud Salim’s own envoys tell me, to being cast off by us, and if we abdicate the position of general arbiters, and active preservers of the peace, which we have occupied so long, I have no doubt some other naval power, probably the French, will be invited, or will invite themselves, and step in. “We send you officially memorials from the merchants here engaged in this trade, which will help to show its character, its wide ramifications to Calcutta, Rangoon, China, and Mauritius, and its great value and importance. The memorialists, you will see, are a very different sort of men from our Hindoo friends at Cabool and Herat, and have been used to a very different sort of protectorate j our abdication of which will, I feel sure, cause more stir than you seem to anticipate. 9638 ft. F22 “ As for remonstrance with the Arabs, I need hardly remind you that it will he effective in exact proportion to their estimate of our power and in tention to use it in enforcing our remonstrances. “ In acting as he did at Soor and Khatiff, Colonel Pelly, I believe, did exactly what his predecessors had been in the habit of doing under similar circum stances. We have sent you copies, I believe, of every letter we sent him. The position is one in which a very large discretion must always, I think, be entrusted to the Political Agent, and when it is impossible to refer for orders, he acts for the best; great allowances should, I think, be made for him’ even if all does not turn out as he expected. “ I hope soon to submit a scheme for the mari time police of the Gulf, but I wish, in doing so, to send you a complete statement of our present maiine, which will take some time to prepare. “ Believe me, &amp;c., “ H. B. E. Frere.” I 3 * S* I have just received a cypher telegram trom Colonel Pelly, in which he says that he has gained a key to the allusion in one of the Wahabee letters to a religious war. ‘ Aboo Esau, who con- ^ ducted Pal grave through Arabia, stated’ (to the c /i) i )eGS ^ ere was as agreement that he c 7 algrave ?) should return and avail themselves of £ the discontent and other circumstances in the Wa- ‘ habee country, revolutionize it, and afterwards convert the people.’ We must remember that tins occurred when Palgrave was travelling under orders from Rome or Paris, and it shows that we do not escape the most serious misunderstanding by mereJy retiring within our own shell, and avoiding omcial intercourse with these people.” 12th 1866 relates to the app^ZTof a British n^atd Mr at R ^ Bo, !', ba &gt;' Government had attached to the ResScy to” b^Cm? , P0tl : eCar y JvinSm 'r 6114 l° f India ’ With0ut a ^!ng foTor the appointment X ^ ana * ,0n ’ tele S ra P hed disallow Mul't/wf understood'^ you* ta/To thither a safe discreet ^ o anted to sen d »i» ...um sidar Agent, receive and transmif f ' tions with the ruler, and not di^matizr' 1 '''''' 3 ' Mr. Rozario' S the PoruTcuese 3 ' 11 ^ S “ Ch a man in long been charge of the Residencythere^’ He'! b '' 1 the place and its people well wa/r t ^ '/ k “ ewwithout authority. Every one, Colonels Felly and Dishrowe, the Arab Consul, the steamer and the naval people, spoke well of him, and seemed to think him just the man to be sent. If Syud Salim held his own and behaved well, Mr. Rozario would have paved the way towards a return of more inti mate relations ; if otherwise, he would have been in little danger, either for his own safety, or of com promising Government. He had frequently before been, for weeks and months at a time, left in charge °f current consular duties of the Residency when Disbrowe was absent. “ But because we did not say all this in a tele gram, you conclude he is unfit, and cancel his ap pointment, and order us to send either a “Ma- homedan gentleman or a British Officer. “ We shall of course do so, but it is only right that I should mention that, in times past, it has been found that “ Mahomedan gentlemen were more likely to represent themselves than the British Goveinment at Muscat, and hence it has been usual to employ either an Armenian or a Jew, when no English Officer was there. I have no doubt we shall be able to find a competent Mahomedan, but you must not be surprised if you find the best Ma homedan in Asia, after a time, taking part either for or against Syud Salim, or representing some other interests than ours. It is only natural that it should be so, and we find it so in the Levant, as well as nearer India, in Afghanistan, &amp;c. “ As for a British Officer, I must say I should like to know a little more of the disposition and power of the present people at Muscat before I trusted a stranger amongst them, at a time of the year when they and we all know that we cannot support him, nor even send a man-of-war to bring him off. I have one or two men who would do so, when we see om ay a little more clearly, but it w T ould require great tact and experience to prevent doing either a little too much or too little, and, if the people were inclined to be troublesome, a British Officer would offer many more points open to affront than a Native Agent or than such a man as Mr. Rozario. “ Believe me, &amp;c., “ H. B. E. Frere. “ -PS .—In this Presidency our apothecaries hold, I believe, a very different position from that held by the same grade in Bengal. Here we have several of them in charge of civil stations, where I know our Officers would not change them for Assistant Surgeons. “ I mention all this to justify our original nomi nation, and to satisfy you that you need not have been apprehensive that we would appoint improper persons to such a duty. I do not wish you to re consider your orders about Mr. R., which I regard as final.” [A Mahomedan was subsequently sent, and died. The Government of India then directed a British*24 Officer to be sent, and he is now there. During his brief incumbency we have twice been drawn into active support of the parricide Sultan against his Uncle Toorkee and his insurgent subjects.] H. B. E. Frere.

The document broadly discusses British imperial policy in Persia and the Persian Gulf, East Africa, and Western India. Its specific foci include the Zanzibar subsidy (payable to Muscat), Persia's desire for a naval presence in the Gulf, the suppression of piracy, the preferred nationality of the Agent at Muscat, and the protection of British subjects trading in the region. The memorandum contains proposals for change in the way the region is administered.Several postscripts consist of extensive extracts from correspondence between Frere and John Lawrence, Viceroy of India, between 23 March 1866 and 12 June 1866.
