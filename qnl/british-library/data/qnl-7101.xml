The following were present at the meeting: Mr. G-.W. Rendel, (in the Chair) ( ^ Foreign Office Mr. K. R. Johnstone ( Sir Ryan, His Majesty's Minister at Jedda. Lieutenant-Colonel T.C. Fov/le, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Mr. J.G-. Laithwaite, India Office. The meeting had before it Sir Andrew Ryan's note of the 16th August, regarding the attitude of King Ihn Saud towards Koweit (see Appendix A). MR. RENDEL outlined the present political situation of Koweit. The Sheikh was tied to His Majesty's Government by his treaty engagements, but at the same time was being courted both by Ibn Saud and by Iraq. It was clear that the Sheikhdom was not in a position which in the ordinary way would enable it to stand alone either as a political or as an economic entity and that it must therefore depend on some stronger Power. He understood that it was the policy of His Majesty's Government, in view of the strategic importance of Koweit, not to allow it to be absorbed by any foreign Power, but, so far as was pobsible, to maintain tneir present treaty relationship with the Sheikh. MR. LAITHWAITE/2. MR. LAITHWAITE suggested that Koweit was at the present noment of more vital importance to His Majesty's Government than it had been at any time since it had 'bulked so promin ently as the terminus of the Baghdad railway before the war. This was the result first of the development of the air route to India and Australia, which had made the Gulf as important imperially from the air standpoint as was the Suez Canal for naval reasons, and secondly owing to the expira tion of the mandatory regime in Iraq and the uncertainty of the future relations of His Majesty's Government with that country. So long as Iraq had 'been under British control, there had been a natural tendency to give it prior con sideration and the less important question of Koweit had been kept comparatively in the background. But now that Iraq had attained full independence, the position was changed and Koweit had once again assumed major importance. Geographically, Koweit occupied a key position at the head of the Persian Gulf, and one from which the Gulf could be controlled. In the event of war we could probably safely assume that Koweit would be on our side and her territory would afford us a base of operations of definite value to the use of which, on the assumption in question, no objection could be raised on the ground that we were violating her neutrality,, Further, with the development of the Arabian coast air route to the East, Koweit was likely to prove more and more vital as a station or that route, especially if our relations with Iraq should at any time become so strained that we v/ere unable to rely on the use of the Iraqi aerodromes for the purposes of that route. COLONEL FOttLE/3 3. COLONEL FOWLE cnggosted that in point of fact it night one day be possible to avoid the use of Iraq altogether and fJy direct from Palestine to Koweit, as the range of the aircraft using the Arabian route in creased, MR. RELMDBL concurred with Mr a Laithwaite's estimate of the position as regards Iraq. In view of recent events in Iraq it was possible that our whole relationship with that country might have to be modified and he considered that both the future of the Anglo-Iraqi treaty and of the position of the Royal Air Force in Iraq must be regarded as doubtfulo On the general point at issue^ he observed that one of the main points to be borne in mind was the fact that Koweit was not naturally inde pendent from either the geographical or the economic point of view. It was a port without a hinterland ? cut off at present by the Iraqi and Saudi frontiers from the territory which it would naturally feed, and at present denied free comiiunication with the country behind it. Moreover 5 even its present trade night be jeopardised by the development of the Saudi port at Ras Tanura under the auspices of the American oil concessionaires on the Hasa coast. What was even more important was that its fresh-water supply was not derived from its own territory, but had tc be imported from Iraq, It was for considera tion therefore whether it would in fact be practicable for His Majesty^ Government to maintain the independence of Koweit as against it:s neighbours^ at any rate on the present basis of a rather loose and ill-defined dependence on His Maj esty 1 s Governmento COLONEL POWLE/4. COLONEL POWLE concurred generally in Mr. Rendel's description of the economic position of the Sheikhdom, lie pointed outj however, that Koweit had always been the port of the deserts of northern Arabia, as Bahrain was the port of Central Arabia. In regard to the position cf Koweit viG-a-vis of Iraq, he added that beside the influence which Iraq could exert by controlling Koweit 1 s irush-'jater supply, it v^as also powerful enough to bring pressure to bear upon Kcwelt ever, for instance^ the question of smuggling. MR. RENDEL agreed that both Iraq and Saudi Arabia were in a position to exert strong pressure on Koweit, This being so, the rivalry between thein over Koweit was likely to increase, unless 01 course Saudi Arabia disintegrated. The present position of Koweit between these two States was weak c.nd oir Andrev/ Ryan s note showed how powerful an attraction Ion baud could exert„ The question therefore was whether His i-.a^eoby s Grovemment would not be well advised to develop and tighten up tneir own relations with Kov/eit in order to strengthen its positions It had in fact been suggested that it night be more advantageous to convert our present treaty relationship into a definite protectorate, on, for instance,, 'bhe analogy oi the Hadramant, which was now regarded as part of txie Aden x-'rotectorate but v/here our treaty relationship v/ith tne local rulers and obligations to afford them protection had been if anything looser than those we had towards Koweit, Would not a Protoctorate ensure Koweit more effectively against aosorption than the present attempt to maintain the oheikhdem as a kind of political vacuum in the Persian Gulf, iRo LAITHWAITE drew attention to three points:- (a)/5. (a) At present the obligations of His Majesty's Government to Kowelt ^er0 represented by thoir undertaking to grant 'good offices 8 in respect of Koweit undor the 1899 Agreement, by their premise of 1907 that 'the town of 'Koweit and its boundaries belong to Sheikh Mobarak-us- 'aiba. Baler of Koweit, and to his hsirs after him' and their undertaking of 3r -d November 1914 that Koweit, in the event of a victory over th« Harks, would be recognised by us as an Independent principality under British protec tion. Thw were tixis vsry general in terms, and, in ac cordance with, our normal policy on the Arab littoral, which dated fran a period in which it was possible to protect a soa port by action from the s#a, but not to afford effoctive help inland, we had consistently endeavoured to limit cur obligations save as regards 'good offices' to Koweit town and, the inmediately ad- Joining area. Recent experience had, however, shown that in cases of intervention from outside it was in fact necessary to give the Sheikh, at our discretion, and on air own teims, a measure of active assistance up to the limit of his frontiers and wltti the developcnent of aircraft the problem of Inland defence was now less difficult. This was to sane extent a strengthening of his strict treaty position, as also possibly an extension of our strict treaty obligations. (b) With regard to the suggested establishment of a Protectorate It was necessary to consider xtet the reactions of the Sheikh would be, and also what effect the proclama tion of a Protectorate might have on the other Arab rulers of the Gulf, It wail4 in any case be wiser not to make an overt proclamation of this nature since both in Bahrein and in Qatar and along the Trucial Coast it would probably rouse apprehensionsapprehensions and might even cause the local Sheikhs to turn away from His Majesty's Government and consider sub- mi tting themselves to Persia or to Ibn SaucL (c) The hasio ol Hi3 Majesty*3 Government's present treaty relationship ^ith Kowait T;a3 unsatisfactory. In the first place it did not rest, as tv &amp; b the case with Bahrein, Muscat and th3 Trucial Sh©ikM(*iiri, on a long series o.t foiml treaties with the Sci^ikh dating hack .tor over a century or, as in the case of Q-s.tar, on a compre hensive treaty, hut was batssd only a comparatively brief correspondence ozchanged bstwe^n tl.ie Srieikhs and HI3 Ivte-Jesty' b Government clnce 1899 and on '[he reciprocal engagenents, still presumably binding d S dcc thsy had not been abrogated, entered tntc in ^onn^iou trlth ths lease of Bunder Shweikh in 1307; secondly thes-e were certain g^ps, Gcg. we had no slavery agro^ent with Xoweit. It might, he aiggested, be possible to fill in the gaps left by tals corrospcsidenca and tlgliten oar ccotrol in that wayo An example sras oar roc eat raquest to the Sheikh for certain under' ; jatclns3 in regard to air- facilities in his Shoilthdcm, one result of v/hlch wc^ld ba to concentrate effective control of such facilities, 7/hether militaiy or civil, in the hands of His WfeJ®fity ! s Goven^ait. Another inatance was c Ui8 recont proposed ^nend^ient of the Komi Order-in-Council so as to place rssponsibili'ty for juris diction over non-Moslem foreigners in th$ hands of His Majesty's Gove mm en to A gradual tlghtsnlag of air con-'orol of this chayacter, particularly if pursued as a definite policy on all ccnvenient occasions p would 8 he thc?aght, at once avoid the difficulties involved in establishing a formal protectorate and would make it very much simpler- COLCNEL7. COLO lEL POITLE expressed the vie™ that there did not seem to be any IntermediPte position possible between a treaty relationship with the jheikh on the present lines and a full Protectorate. The sheikh would certainly be unwilling to agree to the sheikhdom becoming a formed protectorate, and En.m- faci£, he (Colonel lowle) was iiot much in favour of it. Ke screed, however, that it would be advisable on suitable opportunities, to try to tighten up our control over the Sheikh. On being Questioned whether he did not consider that our restricted Position vis-a-vis of the Sheikh in regard to the oweit oil concession indicated the essential weak ness of our treaty position, he replied that our difficul ties in that case had been due rather to the special undertakings given to the United States Government in that natter than to any weakness in our normal control over the Sheikh under the treaty engagements. Had we been able, without violating our pledges to the United States Govern ment, to tell the Sheikh that we required him to give the concession to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company he would have done so. MR. RENDEL drew attention to the fact that in the event of serious misgovernment by the Kuler of Koweit such as prejudicially to affect foreign citizens in Koweit we might find ourselves in a difficult position vis-a-vis the foreign power concerned. Ml?. LAITHWAITE said that on this noint he thought that Bahrain might be regarded as locus clasjil_cus. '. e had for many years put up with a considerable degree of misgovernment by Sheikh Isa. But when conditions at last in our view became intolerable we did not hesitate to intervene and to depose the Sheikh. Ihere0, Tiere were obvious arsmnentG- for doing so, for were we not to intervene when ralsgovernment had reached a certain pitch it would be most difficult for us to justify a re fusal to allow foreign governments which migfrt be affected to take steps to protect the interests of their nationals. e did not think that there need be any apprehension in the case of Koweit that we would fail to bring pressure on a bheikh who was abusing his position, once it became necessary to do so. The case for early intervention would probably be stronger now that the Gulf was so much more in the public eye. The meeting then went on to consider relations between Ibn Gaud and Koweit. SIR A'ftTJSW HYAN stated that he had been impressed by the apparent weakness of His Majesty's Government's position vis-a-vis of Ibn Baud with regard to Koweit. His T pjesty's Government were not strongly placed, when it becr.ne necessary to warn Ibn Saud to keep his hands off Ko^eit, since they were committed to maintain ing that Koweit v/as technically an independent State. A case in point had been the Saudi intrusions into Ko^eit territory referred to in paragraph 3 of his note, when Saudi officials had performed acts of authority within the limits of the sheikhdom. COLO EL FOWLE pointed out that in fact our treaty engagements did entitle us to prevent foreign ?owers from dealing direct with the Sheikh. Ibn Spud had certainly been informed of the special relations existing between the Sheikh and His I pjesty's Government. Speaking generally, he added that infact little trouble was likely to be experienced with foreigners in Koweit,so long as it remained a Beduin town ruled by a Beduin Sheikh and not, like Bahrain, a relatively cosmopolitan commercial centre. If,however,oil were discovered within the oheikh- dom, it was possible that difficulties might arise. Lih. FvLlTJH9o IHR* RENDEL pointed out that the Arabian air route was likely to develop quicklyo If Iraq were to adopt an anti^ foreign policy, and Koweit became correspondingly more important as a centre of international traffic, other countries might well wish to take advantage of the facilities there. We might well find many foreign Powers becoming increasingly interested in Koweit. We could not have it both ways, and should sooner or later have to define our position. His Majesty's Government ought, therefore, to orient their policy definitely either towards the greater independence of the Sheikhdom or towards a tightening of their own control„ MR. LAITHV/AITE agreed and added that, in his view, our policy should he directed towards a closer control t but that it was undesirable to hasten any overt declara tion of full control, such as the establishment of a protectorate would be. Such a declaration might well frighten the Sheikhs of Bahrain and of the Trucial Coast and do more harm than goodo The policy to be followed was, therefore, one of occasional minor adjustments, as these became necessary, tending to increase, or at any rate not to relax, our control over the Sheikhdom. Reverting to the question of Saudi-Koweiti relations, Sj.R RYxla drew attention to the toleration extended by His Majesty's Government to direct correspondence on business matters between the Sheikh and Ibn Saud, This, no less than the independence formula, placed us in a weak position in defending Koweit, and the correspondence in question was of such long standing that it was difficult now for us to take the line that Ibn Saud should write to us rather than to the Sheikh* What was desirable was that\b 10. v/e should be able to tell Itm Saud openly that v;e were responsible for defending the Sheikh's interests in any given dispute, MR. LAITHVAITE said that the explanation of the system of direct correspondence betv/een the Sheikh and Ibn Saud v/as, he thought, that it dated from a time when the latter wae not so important a ruler as he had since become and when we had taken the view that it was un necessary to take too strict a view of correspondence between Sheikh and Sheikh, That position was now changed, and reconsideration seemed desirable. Ibn Saud was well aware both that Kis Majesty 4 s Government conducted the foreign relations of Koweit and that the Sheikh had. undertaken certain obligations towards us,. He agreed that it was now necessary to exert stricter control over the correspondence in question and to emphasize our own special position in Koweit vis-a-vis of Ibn Saud more definitely than had been the case while Iraq was still under British control. He suggested that we might: (a) check Ibn Saud when he appeared to be presuming too far with regard to Koweit - a policy which we were in fact now prepared to follow in regard to the Saudi-Koweit blockade, and (b) enforce stricter regula tions on the Sheikh in the matter of direct correspondence. COLONEL FOWLS agreed. Such action would show both the Sheikh and Ibn Saud that we considered the Sheikh to Le under our direction. If we did not take some such step as this f we might be in danger of finding ourselves faced with the results of a kind of conspiracy between the Sheikh and Ibn Saud, We ought, therefore, to write to the ...11. the Sheikh in the seriise that we noted that his private correspondsnc© viith llr&lt;7i Baud had ass*jjT*cd an increasing importance and toil h'hw iha'c that correspondence rMBt now cease. MRo RENDSL concurred, A straightforward control of this nature would 'be easier to maintain and wouid prevent a repetition of such incidents as the letter in which Ihn Saud had recently tried to detach the Sneikh of Koweit from his connexion with Hie Majesty's Government, SIR A. RYAN also concurred, and drew attention to the success with which Ito Saud was spreading the idea that he might naturally ahsoro Koweit and was hound to do so sooner or laterHe pointed out that such an n.dea could never have prevailed to the extent to v/hich it had., if His Majesty's Government had equally definitely made known their own special position with regard to Koweitc The meeting then discussed what point in the corres pondence between the Sheikh and Ton Saud could most suit ably he taken up in connexion with the reprimand which it was proposed to address to hoth parties. MB. LAITHWAITS suggested that if it were discovered that the Sheikh had committed himself to Ihn Saud in regard to the grant of an oil concession in the Koweit Neutral Zone, this might he an excellent opportunity for checking him. The question then arose what action could he taken if tho United States Government, ■in dealing with whom His Maj isty's Government had consistently emphasised the Sheikh's independence, were to produce communications from him regarding the grant of a concession in the Neutral Zone, It was, however, agreed that His Majesty's Govern ment could demonstrate from the Sheikh's treaty engagements that he had not heen entitled to make any such grant with out „,.12 c wlthov.t our knov/ledge and consent. Eventually it was agreed that the most sultahle occasion lor the proposed representations to the Sheikh and Ihn Baud would he Ihn Saud's letter suggesting terms for the settlement of the Saudi blockade of Koweit and warning the Sheikh against His Majesty's Governmentc At the conclusion of the meeting SIR Ac RYAN raised the question of the pressure which might 'be exerted upon Ihn Saud in regard to the Saudi blockade of Koweit. This 'blockade had one of two purposes, either to complete the economic strangulation of Koweit and lead to its complete absorption in Saudi Arabia,,, or else the safeguarding of Saudi economic interests„ His Majesty's Government could not possibly allow the first of these alternatives,. The Question therefore was what real force there was in Ibn Saud's suggestion that his own purely economic interests required the maintenance of the blockade. COLONEL FOWLE suggested that we might well revert to the Sheikh's proposal that Ibn Saud should have customs posts at a given place along but outside the Koweiti border, and that this might, if necessary, be coupled with a system of manifests for Koweiti-Saudi trade. He gave it as his opinion that even if Ibn Saud were to develop Ras Tanura, possibly with American help, this port was not likely to compete seriously with Koweit, which served quite a different hinterland, nor was there any port between the Koweit area and the Ras Tanura area which could be successfully developed as a rival to Koweit, COLONEL FO'VLE suggested that on his return to the Gu lf ,. 513, Gulf on 16th October he eliould discuss tlie c^Luation r vith Colonel Dickson ? Political .Igent, Koweib e v/ho had great experience oi the shelkhdccn, in the lignt ci the conversa~ tions at the present meeting, and should submit a compre hensive report. It was agreed that this course should he adopted, and that in the light of the resident's report and of the conclusions of the present meeting the quest ion of future policy in Koweit should he discussed if necessary in the Kiddle East Official 3uh~Committee * The conclusions of the meeting were as follows: (1) That in dealing v/ith Ihn Baud, His Ilajepty's Government should increseinsly emphasize the closeness of their relations with the Sheikh* (2) That the Sheikh should he told that his personal correspondence with Ihn Saud on official matters was to cease* (3) That the issue of the Saudi 'blockade of Koweit should he taken up with Ihn Saud hy His Majesty's Govern ment on the hasis oi their obligation to protect the interests of Koweit* (4) That on receipt of the despatch promised hy Colonel Fowle the whole question of relations between His Majesty's Government and Koweit might suitably be referred for further discussion to the Middle JIast Official Sub- Committee 5 to which a note should be sent recording the points discussed at the present meeting, and setting forth the arguments for and against the possible declaration of a protectorateo14. Note b y S ir .uidrew Ryan * Ibn Saud's attitude tov/ards Kowait o I have been turning over in my mind for some time the possibility that it may be a definite object of Ibn Saud's policy to reduce Kowait to a position of dependence on him somewhat similar to that of Asir from 1926 to 1930. This is in the nature of a pure speculation but it is a speculation so interesting that I think it worth while to collect the principal data bearing on it. It must be admitted at the outset that, if Ibn Saud had such an idea in his head, he would realise the need for great caution lest he should indispose His Majesty's Government. His only formal obligation towards the latter is that contained in j-irticlo 6 of the Treaty of Jedda but he understands very well the implications of the words therein 'who are in special treaty relations with His Britannic Majesty's Government', On the other hand he has seen His Majesty's Government tolerate direct correspondence on business subjects between him and the Sheikh of Koweit. He might think that they would not react over strongly if he and the Sheikh confronted them with the fait accompli of a political deal. 2 0 Apart from the correspondence, of which we have knowledge, there has been other intercourse between the rulers, notably the Sheikh's visit to Pdadh in 1932, the secret messages brought by Ibn Saud's comidential messenger to the Sheikh early this year and the Sheikh's mysterious dashes into Nejd last February, when Colonel Dickson surmised that he had gone to meet some high Saudi personage, possibly Ibn Saud himself. 3. I may interpolate, as a minor indication of Ibn Saud's attitude, a reference to two occasions on which it has been suggested or hinted by his Ministry of Foreign Affairs that His Majesty's15. iajesty's Ciov .ranent should uot concern theusolves violi aiiai-s between Saudi Aradia and Kowait. I class thea as minor, uuc^uso this position has never been categorically asserted, me xirct was -'hen, in reply to a couplaint of uine regarding Saudi encroaciu-icnts on Ko'-ait t.-rritory, vliich had aeruir. eu lis 1 ajesty's Goverxiaent, the reply was in eifect: 'Sorry you have been perturbed. You need not have been if the matter had been pursued through An. ilafisi'. en another occasion rUid Joy, in rather li.uht conversation, asked ae ''ny we concornud oarselves in miters between his Govern,'.eni and ^waii. 4. vhe personal relations between the iv/o rulers are peculiar Ibn Gaud grow up at ...o '•■It and it is soaetii.es said that he has shown hiasclf ungrateful to his former hosts. It is saiu cy others, I do not know on what precise grounds, tnat ^.uoaraK treated ibn Sand very badly, -.nyhow, through all the relations there runs a thread of old friendship, ho^ovsr flimsy and however frayed by frequent friction over raids, the eaoargo and so on. It has helped towards the settleaeni of minor questions. It has not deterred Ibn Sand from eniorcm .i tne . embargo on traue but the embargo on trade has not destroyed the Sheikh' s ostensible friendliness towards Ibn Baud, ahoy are cades . abo' as I once wrote snd they both eomeine some real friendship for His ...ajesty's Government and a healthy fear oi them with a good deal of fundamental mistrust. 5. ihe point of my theory or speculation is that, ix the Sheikh of Kowait were at all willing to be 'Asirized', Ibn Sana could make the proposal quite attractive on the following lines, if I may venture to put into his mouth the sort oi language he could usg:- (a) 'You arc not _*eally ijilopcndout, uy aoar follow* iou 'are under the timab of the .aglish. ' hey might annex you at ' any'any moment or even present you to Iraq. If you must 'be 'dependent on some one, v/hy 'be dependent on those untrustv/orthy 'imperialists, when you might depend, without 'being exactly 'dependent, on a man like me, old friend, fellow tosiem, fellow 'Arah and the one big independent man in Arabia' e ('b) M I don't like squeezing you, I really don't, with that 'embargo. As things are at present I have to think of my own 'interests. But if your interests wore mine, we could easily 'have an understanding, a sort of *Zollverein' as they say: 'same duties levied in our ports; free competition between 'yours and mine; free trade over our land border. VTiat have 'the English done about it? Nothing, because they cannot get 'at me. Sois mon frerc, et .je te fais vivre. Sois le leur, 'e t je te tue '. (c) 'I should not mop you up of course. You would rule 'your state under an understanding with me. Indeed, if you 'were in with me, I might recognise a sort of influence of 'yours over those three Lost xTibes that you always want back. 'Look at how I treated the Idrisi. I made a sensible agreement 'with him in 1926. lie remained a ruler with tribal influence. 'I did not take charge in his country, until he got into such 'a mess that he asked me to in 1930. I did not hit him on the 'head until the poor mutt thought he could try conclusions with 'me in 1932. He looked to foreigners and he got it in the neck 'from me' . (d) 'You have had trouble with Iraq over your property there. ' ihat has England been able or even willing to do for you? 'If I had the right to protect you against third parties, you 'would find that I knew how to see you through. ' (e) 'Then there's oilo People are after it in my country 'and in yours and in the ileutral Zone. hy not have an agreed 'policy17. 'policy and present a coimnon front to the '/est. You know what 'the n. P.O. C. is. Another name for the British Government, 'as we saw in Persia the other day, even if we had not known 'it before. Take my tip and keep them out at all costs. 'Play ahout with Holmes, if you like. But don't trust him 'and remember that in the long run your best policy would be 'to deal like me direct with American interests, using the 'others to put up the price'. 6. It is easy enough to detect fallacies in the above imaginary address. I do not know enough about the Sheikh of Koweit to judge what his reaction to it would be but many an Arab, not well pleased with British protectors, might find it convincing enough to be attracted into Ibn Saud's parlour. 7. I wrote the above notes in Jedda at the end of June. I thought them too hypothetical at that time to submit them for official consideration,. They may, however, be worthy of some attention now that the Political Resident and I are both in this country and Colonel Dickson will soon be available for consultation. Except that Ibn Saud continues to shew a marked anxiety to avoid all complications, I see no material reason to modify what I wrote nearly three months ago, subject always to the consideration that I merely suggest an uncertain working theory to be tested by further examination and by keeping a close watch on future developments.

By the Agreement of 23r(l January 1899 His Lajesty's Government formally assured the Sheikh 'of the good, offices of the British Government towards you, your heirs and successors, so long as you, your heirs and successors scrupulously and faithfully observe trie conditions of the said Bond', under which the Sheikh had pledged himself, his heirs and successors, not to receive the agent or representative of any power or government at Koweit without the previous sanction of the British Government and not to cede, sell, lease, or mortgage, or give for occupation or for any other purpose, any portion of his territory to the government or subjects of any other power without the previous consent of His Majesty's Government. 2. By Article IX of the Secret A;-;reeu.0]it o/C loth Octooer 1907 for tne lease of the Bunder shweikh foreshore, the Political Agent intimated that he was 'duly authorised on behalf of the precious Imperial English Government to promise ana do hereby promise that the town of Koweit and its boundaries likewise belong to sheikh i^obarak-us-Suba, fiuler of Koweit, and to his heirs after him, and that all Sheikh Lobarak's arrangements in the matter of customs etc. and all his arrangements at the present day shall remain in the hands of sheikh Mobarak-us-Suba, Huler of Kov/eit, and of his heirs after him, and...' In consideration of this promise the sheikh undertook not to levy customs aues in excess of 4% on goods imported or exported by 'the subjects of the aforesaid English Government' save with the approval of that 'Government.5. The undertakings given in writing to the sheikh on org :.cveiucer 1914 in return lor his cooperation against the Turks contained an assurance that 'Kovveit shall he recognised as an independent principality under British protection.' 3. Construction of the undertakings ^iven to the Sheikh . 4. As will he seen, the engagements entered into by His ivajesty's Government with the Sheikh are in rather general terms and it is perhaps aesirahle briefly to record the construction placed upon them at various times by His 1-aj e sty' s Go v e rnment. In 1901, when there was a Turkish threat to Koweit the Viceroy was informed (secretary of State's telegram No.45 of 4th December 1901, P,1417/01) that this 'appears to constitute a distinct violation of the Sultan's promise' (to respect the status quo ) 'ana in these circumstances His Majesty's Government are prepared to support the Sheikh and will not tolerate an attack by Turkish troops or ships upon Koweit. The Sheikh should not leave Koweit and should continue to observe his engagement with us'. The assurance given is clearly limited by the words 'in these circumstances' to this particular case. Moreover, it is not conditional on and is independent of the sheikh's observance of his Agreement of 1899. * ^ ^* On 21st i.arch 1903 Lord Lansdowne, then Secretary of State 10r Foreign Affairs, in a Memorandum on the situation in Koweit remarked that our obligations towards the Sheikh were 'as ill-defined as the boundaries of his Principality. *Ye have distinctly announced that he does not enjoy British 'protection'; on the other hand we once made him a present of £1,000, and promised him our 'good offices' whatever that may mean. When we made this promise we were, I feel no doubt, thinking/{$) - 3 - thinking of Koweit proper, 11 there is such a thing,and not of Booby an or other outskirts over which the ,Sheikh has rights of one sort or another...We might it seems to me explain (1) to the Porte (2) to the Sheikh, and (3) to the foreign Powers immediately interested the objects of our policy. I should he inclined to say that our engagements to Koweit do not extend heyond the district adjoining or close to the hay of that name and to endeavour to obtain the adhesion of the Porte and of the Sheikh to our approximate definition of that district...' 7. Later in 1902 it was reported that ibn Hashid was making energetic preparation for attacking Ion 3aud, then the Sheikh of Koweit 1 s friend, and the Sheikh was v/arned not to take any action likely to bring him into difficulties with either Nejd or Turkey. About the same time the sheikh informed us that IbnEeshU had with him a gun presented by the Turks and asked for a gift of 2 or 3 guns which it was understood were wanted for Jehara to protect Koweit against P-2639/02 land attac.k. The Viceroy (telegram No.39 of 3rd October 1902) proposed to reply that the Sheikh's request could not be granted, 'but that provided he c omplied with the injunction conveyed to him in pursuance of your telegram of 4th December 1901 (see paragraph 5 above) His Majesty's Government would charge themselves with the defence of Koweit district.' The Secretary of State after consultation with the Foreign Office (P.O. letter of 13th October 1902) replied (telegram No.133 of 14th October 1902) 'I approve your proposed reply about the guns, provided Koweit district is clearly defined as the district adjoining or close to the bay of that name.' This assurance similarly admits of being read as an assurance ad hoc , and it is relevant that when, in April 1911, enquiry was made by the Secretary of State for India of the Government- 4 - 3 /3 t3 g /I. telrn. 51.3.11. 3/3 for I. go Viceroy telm. a/- 18.3.11. viceroy tc 3/S. 25 .3.11. P.523/11. of India whether the definition in question of Koweit territory had bean coiiiiiiunicated to the sheikh they replied that it might be assumed that it had, but that it 'only referred to our pledge to defend him against Ibn riashid who was threatening the iirimediate neighbourhood of Koweit.' (telegram of 6th April 1911, P.594/11). 8. The more specific undertakings embodied in the Bunder 3hweikh lease of 1907 and Quoted in paragraph 2 above may be regarded as to some extent corrmitting us in respect of 'the town of Koweit ana its boundaries'. The phrase 'its boundaries' is, however, very vague, and could perhaps most reasonably be construed as applying to the inmediate district around Koweit town. The discussions as to our obligations to the 3heikh which took place in 1911 and which are summarised in paragraphs 9 to 12 below, appear to have turned essentially on the undertakings 011899. 9. In 1911, in connection with the Anglo-Turkish negotiations, the question of our obligations was examined in some detail. , , The Government of India, on being asKeo, wiuQ reference to Lord Lansdowne's memorandum of 190^ to which reference is made in paragraph 6 above, to 'define the region to which-our obligation extends, and 'whether they accepted' general description of boundaries in Persian Gulf Gazetteer, page 1059 etc;' replied 'We are of opinion that (1) our obligations extend to the limits of the .Sheikh's territory, (2) these limits, to the best of our knowledge, are defined with fair accuracy by Lorimer, especially as regards northern portion...' 10. The Secretary of State for India in the light of the Government of India's views, wrote as follows to the Foreign Office (p.594/11, 8th April 1911); 'Viscount/12./ . ^ - 5 - 'Viscount Morley is not aware on what grounds the opinion expressed by the Marquess of Lansdowne in his memorandum of 21st llkrch 1902 is based, but he observes that the language used is very tentative, and, so far as he knows, the subject v/as never pursued along the lines suggested by His Lordship, except in the case of the attack on the immediate neighbourhood of Koweit threatened by Ibn Rashid in the autumn of 1902. It will be seen from the Government of India's telegram of 6 April that this incident does not affect their opinion that our general obligations extend, to the limits of Koweit territory as described in Vol.11 pp.1059-1051 of Lorimsr^s G-azetteer of the Persian Gulf, copy of which is in your possession. In this Lord '.'orley concurs: that is to say he thinks that in the event of unprovoked aggression by the Turks or by Arab tribes under Turkish control, upon those limits, H.M.C t . could not abstain from using their 'good offices' in the Sheikh's favour. But the term 'good offices' is a very vague one, which H.M.G-. are at liberty to interpret at their discretion, and which they would doubtless interpret with more or less strictness according to the nature and locality of the aggression, and all the circumstances of the case. It would, however, in His Lordship's opinion, be very impolitic to attempt, in dealing with the Sheikh, to whittle down the extent of our obligations, since such a course would fill his mind with suspicions and could not fail to affect our unfavourably/prestige in the Persian Gulf....' P.3489/^ 11, 'phe F.O.replied on 9 'ay 1911 that Sir E.Grey concurred 'in the viev; of the Government of India, shared by Viscount Morley, that these obligations extend to the whole territory of the Sheikh as described in the passage of Lorimer's Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf to which your letter refers.'Q 12. In Au^: 1911 the Government of India, after consultation with the Political Resident (Sir P.Cox) recommended that T . should communicate oo o: e Tijirks X t - Viceroy a copy of the Agreement of 1699 with a no'^e that n.^i.ij.had j. _ n /o K ' ' for I, subsequently informed the Sheikh that so lon,£, as he ana his 30 Aug heirs and successors acted up to tneir obligations undsr u-e 11 P.1446/ 11 Agreement, we charged ourselves t/O support uhem ana to protect Koweit against attack by land or sea.' The Secretary of State for India, on closer consioeraoion, louiiQ himself unable to accept this proposal. India Office letter to the Foreign Office of 30th October,1911, ?. 1446/11, remarked: 'The telegrams of 4th December 1901 and 14th October 1902, on which the Government of India appear to base the obligation to protect Koweit by land and sea, in the Marquis of Crewe's opinion clearly refer only to the incidents that occasioned them and cannot be understood ^o have given any general undertaking, i.or, in view o^ the fact that it has since been decided that our obligations extend to the whole of the Sheikh's territory as described in Lorimer's Gazetteer, would it be safe to pledge ourselves to any specific method of defending them. As was pointed oj ^ by Lord Morley in this Office letter of 6th April last, the term 'good offices' (which by Colonel Meade's letter of 23rd January 1899 we undertook to accord to the Sheikh)is a conveniently vague one and Lord Crewe is oi opinion tnat it is neither necessary nor safe to go beyond it. The action taken by K.M.G. in 1901/02, when men and guns were landed at Koweit to defend it against unprovoked Turkish aggression, will, moreover, have made it plain to the Porte in what way we are prepared to interpret the term if necessity arises. 'Kis Lordship would therefore suggest that the formula should run: 'As regards No.l, H.M.G, have imormed the Sheikh of Koweit that so long as he and his heirs and successors/« - 7 - successors act up to their obligations under the Agreement, H.M.G-, undertake to support them and accord them their good offices,' with perhaps the addition that H.I'.Cr. reserve to themselves the right to interpret that term at their discretion.' The Foreign Office (?.0.letter dated 1st November 1911) accepted the proposed redraft and addition and a communication in this sense was made to Tewfik Pasha in Sir Edward Gray's letter of 24th October 1911(42135), 13. The undertaking given in 1914 that Koweit 'shall be recognised, as an independent principality under British protection' may be regarded as importing a degree of responsibility for the protection of the principality as a whole, 14. On the death of Sheikh Mobarak his eldest son was informed in March 1916 on his accession by the Viceroy that ,: so long as you act up to the existing arrangements with the British Government you may expect the same support as was P.CL13, enjoyed by your father,' A similar assurance was given on p.75 para,15. Sheikh Jabir's death in 1917 to his brother and successor, P.G-.15, Sheikh Salim, in March 1917. Sheikh Salirn's conduct was p .76 para.18. unsatisfactory and it was found necessary to warn him,through the Political Resident, on 5th July 1918, that the assurances (which presumably covered the assurance of 3 Nov. 1914) conveyed to him on his accession were conditional on his good behaviour and that should acts 'contrary to the interests of (His Majesty's Government' 'unfortunately be P.G.13, committed in future' he would be held personally responsible. p. 76 para.20. 15• In connection with the operations against the Ikhwan in 1928 the question of the precise extent of the obligations of H.li.G.for the defence of Koweit was considered innbhe India Office, when the view was put forward that Cf.P.G. 13,p. consideration of our engagements suggested that on a strict 82 para. 40- reading our liability could be confined to the protection of/- 8 - of the town of Koweit and that we are not called upon to protect Koweit territory as a whole. Conclusio n. 16. As will be seen from the correspondence summarised above (a) we appear consistently to have ta^en the view that our obligations are conditional on the good behaviour of the Sheikh; (b) secondly, subject to this reservation, we are committed to 'good offices !i in respect of 'Koweit', an assurance which has since 1911 been accepted as extending to the whole territory of the Sheikhdom, but which would not commi t u s to anything further than d i jj lomat i c suppo rt ; (c) thirdly, we have promised 'that the town of Koweit and its boundaries' 'belong to ' the heirs of Sheikh :..orarak; (while the payment of rent for the Bunder Shweikh• site was terminated in 19C7, the Agreement of 1907 was not abrogated, and the reciprocal pledges embodied in that Agreement should apparently still be regarded as binding in so far as they are not affected by other subsequent instruments. We communicated Article IX of the Bunder Shweikh Agreement to Ibn Saud in 1928: and in 1933 the P.A.Koweit and the Political Resident brought to notice the continued e:, istence of the obligations of the Sheikh in regard to Customs duties (para. 2 above) under Article X of the Agreement) (d) fourthly,that we have undertaken to recognise, and have in fact recognised, Koweit as an independent principality under British protection. No definition has been given or attempted of the meaning of 'British protection' in this connection; and while prima fa^cie the Sheikh might apparently be justified in claiming that it represented an assurance of effective protection in respect of the Vi.ole of his principality, there is some room for discussion as to its precise implications, and it is noteworthy that no appeal appears to have been made under it either by the present Sheikh or by his predecessors.
