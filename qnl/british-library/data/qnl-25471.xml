CONFIDENTIAL. i [December 3.] Section 2. [54601] No. 1. Lord Inchcape to Mr. Parker.—{Received December 3.) My dear Parker, 9, Throgmorton Avenue, London, December 2, 1913. I ENCLOSE copy of a letter I am sending this evening to Hakki. I hope it may have the desired effect. Slaughter has suggested to the Lynch connection that Air. John Lynch should be president of the company and that I should be chairman of the board, Lynch presiding at the annual general meetings. This will suit me quite well. All I want is to be in a position to see that the business is properly conducted, the steamers properly kept up, and the public properly served, also that the two concerns, Lynch’s and the Ottoman Company, should work hand in hand, and together supply a regular and reputable service on the rivers. Yours sincerely, INCHCAPE. Enclosure in No. 1. Lord Inchcape to Hakki Pasha. Your Highness, December 2, 1913. I THINK it is well, before the meeting which is to take place to-morrow between your Highness, Sassoon Effendi, and myself and my solicitors, that I should set certain considerations very clearly before you. I have, as your Highness must realise, devoted a great amount of valuable time and have been put to great expense by the prolonged delay which has taken place in the present negotiations, which show little sign of termination even now, although I had gone through each clause with your Highness many months ago, and concessions had been made on either side before we reached what we both regarded and initialled as an acceptable compromise. A few weeks ago the Ottoman Government furuished your Highness with a catalogue of criticisms which would have had the effect of very materially altering the terms of the concession. Nevertheless, ten days ago, being desirous of meeting the wishes of the Imperial Ottoman Government as far as possible, I gave way on several important points, and w'e reached a compromise which your Highness thereupon telegraphed to Constantinople. I understand, however, that you are now opposed to the signature of the concession until the statutes have been examined in detail. If this is so I am afraid no useful purpose will be served by continuing the negotiations, and I shall have to consider whether a communication to this effect should not be made to Sir E. Grey. It appears to me that the Ottoman Government fail to appreciate the fact that I am desirous of working the concession in a manner advantageous to them and to the general interests of the trade of the country, and of the local population. In particular I regret I must definitely decline to accept any further modification of the wording of article 14. I regret also that I cannot make any further concessions in regard to custom duties on fuel. I understand Sir E. Grey is most anxious that the concession should be signed this week. I am prepared to sign the concession as already agreed upon, except in minor matters of detail, but I cannot possibly continue negotiations if the past procedure continues to be followed of constantly going back upon what has already been settled, with the result that further concessions are demanded with the object apparently of whittling away any advantages previously agreed in return for concessions assented to by me. I have already made concessions about the property of the municipalities of Bagdad and Zor, and have agreed to a suitable arrangement about Aga Djaffer. [1963 c—2] \ 24BEC1S13I submit that I am fully entitled to express to your Highness, and to ask you to convey to Sassoon Effendi, the reasonable resentment I feel at the treatment I am receiving, and I would express the hope that after these prolonged negotiations a final settlement may be reached to-morrow on all points, failing which I feel sure you j will appreciate that there is no course open to me other than to break off negotiations.

I AM directed by the Board of Trade to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th December, transmitting copy of a letter from Messrs.

The Board see no objection to the modifications, now suggested by the firm, of the proposals contained in the Foreign Office letter to them of the 15th November; and I am accordingly to suggest, for Sir E.

Slaughter and May to Foreign Office.—{Received December 12.) Sir, 18, Austin Friars, London, December 11, 1913. WE have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant, which we at once transmitted to onr clients, and have now their instructions. They have considered the copies of the letters enclosed in your letter now under reply, and their views are :— They do not understand, nor do we, what is involved by Lord Inchcape’s suggestion that if he and Mr. Lynch disagree Lord Inchcape’s views are in the first instance to prevail. What our clients and we have agreed to is, what they and we think should be adhered to, namely, that the regulations of the Management Company should provide that in case of disagreement between Lord Inchcape and Mr. Lynch the matter should not be proceeded with until determined by a referee to be named in the statutes. Any other procedure would involve the conduct of the Management Company being, so to speak, liable to be reversed by the referee on appeal, and might cause unfortunate complications. We are instructed to add that Mr. Lynch anticipates, equally with Lord Inchcape, that the possibility of divergence of opinion is extremely remote. As regards the Belgian Company, our clients concur that if for any unforseen reason it proves impossible to carry out the transfer of the management of the Belgian Company to the New Management Company, there would be reason for an adjustment of the sum of 5,000L mentioned in Lord Inchcape’s letter, but that 5,000Z. would, if it were paid, be payable as described in your letter of the 15th ultimo, namely, partly in consideration of the emoluments of the management of the Belgian Company, and partly of proposal No. 4 in Sir Edward Grey’s memorandum of the 19th May. There therefore does not appear either to our clients or ourselves any reason for interfering with what has been a cardinal principle throughout, that in the New Management Company to deal with the affairs of the Ottoman Company and the Euphrates and Tigris Company the shares of Lord Inchcape and Mr. Lynch should he equal and identical. The question of the inclusion of the Belgian Company was, as you are aware, raised at a late date, and was accepted by our clients to meet the views of the Foreign Office, without pressing the suggested compensation in the shape of the transhipment of cargo at Basra, but the basis of equal division of the shares In the Management Company had been accepted by Lord Inchcape long previously, and cannot now be reconsidered. We shall be obliged if you will kindly let us have a copy of the draft statutes of the proposed New Ottoman Company and a copy of the draft convention, which will of course be treated as absolutely confidential. We are, &amp;c. SLAUGHTER and MAY. [1963 m —4][This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Government,] ASIATIC TURKEY AND ARABIA. CONFIDENTIAL. [November 28.] Section 2.

Section 1. , i Jj 55199] No. 1. (No. 984.) Sir, Sir L. Mallet to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received December 8.) Constantinople, December 3, 1913. I HAVE the honour to forward herewith a despatch from His Majesty’s consul at Basra, reporting a conversation with the managing director of Messrs. Lynch Brothers regarding the transport of railway material and intended extension of wharf accommodation. I HAVE the honour to report that the managing director of Messrs. Lynch Brothers informed me yesterday that the quantity of Bagdad Railway material accumulated at the German depot here awaiting shipment to Bagdad is about 1(),G00 tons. 4'he launches of the Societe de Transports fluviaux en Orient are now all’working except one, which is temporarily replaced by the “ Bulbul.” Messrs. Lynch Brothers succeeded m carrying out their contract for the first time last month, and forwarded 2,500 tons of railway material, this being the minimum quantity required under the terms of their agreement with the Bagdad Railway Company, as reported m my despatch No. 51, Confidential, of the 29th October, 1912. Mr. Tod further informed me that, owing to the large accumulation of material at Basra, shipments from Germany are being temporarily suspended. Mr. Tod appeared to assume that a fusion of the interests of the two river companies (Lynch, Idare) would shortly be effected in London, and in view of this he stated that he had approached his directors with the object of securing more wharfage space on the river front at Basra by purchasing or hiring part of the 16 acres of Seniye property, situated between the Ashar and Khendek creeks, which is now being put up to auction. According to instructions received here from Constantinople, this ground, being part of the ex-Sultan’s domains, is to be sold m lots, and only Turkish subjects are permitted to buy it. The price offered at present by the Mallaches (owners of date gardens at Basra) is i 5 piastres pei squaie metre oi river frontage and 50 piastres per square metre for land at the back. ^ T l v -x-rts At/'* I have, &amp;c.

Minute by Mr. Parker. Euphrates and Tigris Navigation Concession. A PROLONGED meeting took place at the Foreign Office to-day to discuss the alterations desired by Turkey in the draft concession, over and above those agreed to by Hakki Pasha and Lord Inchcape ten days ago. There were present Hakki Pasha and Sassoon Effendi, Lord Inchcape and his two solicitors, Sir Henry Johnson and Mr. Hotblack, and myself. Lord Inchcape told me before the meeting that he was very much disgusted by the whole matter, that he could make more profit by bargaining in regard to a single ship to be built for the British India than he would out of this concession in a whole year, and that he had wasted so much time over the draft during the last six months that he had definitely decided to throw up the whole business if a settlement was not reached within ten days. When the meeting began Hakki Pasha said that he had been much surprised by the receipt of a strongly-worded letter from Lord Inchcape, and Sassoon Effendi said that the Turkish Government’s one desire was to smooth away difficulties which would greatly embarrass Lord Inchcape in the future. Lord Inchcape retorted that there were four principal points in dispute, and he could not see how the adoption of the Turkish contentions regarding them would smooth away difficulties for him. Those conten tions were :— f 19 DEC 1913 1. That Lord Inchcape should be deprived even of a reasonable assurance that, after having- raised thousands of pounds for the navigation, the navigation should not be rendered impossible by irrigation works executed without any regard to the importance of maintaining navigation. In the absence of such an assurance nobody in England would invest a farthing in the enter prise.2. Lord Inchcape was to be deprived, almost entirely, of the benefit of customs exemption for fuel during the exclusive period of the con cession ; yet this arrangement was a compromise he had reached with Hakki Pasha in July, his Lordship’s original demand having been for customs exemption in perpetuity, as regards fuel, or at all events for 99 years as in the case of the rest of the property of the Company. Now it was proposed that, even during the exclusive period of the concession, freedom from customs duties should not be accorded on fuel if the dividends on the ordinary share capital should reach 9 per cent. 3. Article 14 was to be modified in such a manner that Lord Inchcape would be deprived of a large measure of control and placed at the mercy of the Ottoman Government in such a way that he could not be certain of working the concession as a commercial success. 4. The Ottoman Government wished the Com pany to convey the mails free of cost, and to debar the Company from carrying foreign mails, from which they might derive a large profit, at all. As regards point 1, Lord Inchcape absolutely refused to adopt any wording except a slight modification of that agreed to in the revise of the 29th November, 1913. After a good deal of discussion Hakki Pasha and Sassoon Effendi admitted that this attitude was reasonable, and I think they will recommend the adoption of the proposed wording at Constantinople. (See article 10.) 2. Sassoon Effendi urged that it was im possible to grant more favourable terms as regards customs exemption on fuel to the Navigation Company than to the Bagdad Rail way Company, as to do so would at once give rise to a claim for equal treatment from the railway company. I replied that it would be perfectly easy to decline such a demand from the railway company, as there was no analogy what ever between the two concerns. The Bagdad Railway was an upstart concession dating from 1903 ; the British rights of navigation dated from the reign of Queen Elizabeth, and it was owing to the action and support of British ships that Turkish power in Mesopotamia existed to-day; the vessels of the Indian Marine had 03 repeatedly assisted the Pashas of Bagdad in suppressing disorder at their request, and British vessels had navigated on those rivers for centuries. In 1846 Sir Stratford Canning had made an arrangement with the Porte by which it was solemnly agreed that only certain restricted dues should be paid on British vessels, but the Turkish Government had in 1860 sought to restrict the privileges granted in 1846, and they had even imposed customs duty on the fuel imported by Messrs. Lynch, a most arbitrary and illegal proceeding. Still we were not now concerned with Messrs. Lynch ; but as regards the new Company I must point out that the declaration of the 29th July, 1913, was a compromise between the British view of unre stricted British rights of navigation free of all but certain specified dues, and the Turkish view of restricted British rights of navigation which could only be exercised subject to the exaction of dues varying according to the exigencies of the moment. We had, in July and August, care fully gone over the ground with regard to dues and customs, and the concession initialled on the 12th August represented what both Hakki Pasha and His Majesty’s Government considered a fair settlement. If, however, the navigation company was to be penalised by the exaction of customs dues merely to avoid requests for exemption from the Bagdad Railway Company it was clear that we had reached no acceptable compromise respecting the navigation question, and I felt confident that His Majesty’s Government would not agree to the increase of the Turkish customs duties from 1! per cent, to 15 per cent, in the absence of such a compromise. Already criticisms were being made in the press in this country that His Majesty’s Government had apparently been too facile in agreeing to the customs increase, and our agreement could not be defended if this long standing controversy of the river navigation were not settled. Moreover, apart altogether from the historical aspect of the question, the Bagdad Railway Com pany had a guarantee, and this guarantee was, up to a point, a valuable asset: would the Ottoman Government give the Navigation Company a guarantee of 5 per cent, on the capital involved, making the guarantee a first charge on the pro posed customs increase ? If so, there might be closer analogy between the two enterprises. [1963 c—3] B 24 Hakki Pasha said that as soon as the gross receipts of the railway reached 4,500 francs per kilometre the exemption from customs on the railway would cease, and I retorted that unless the working expenses guarantee were modified the Railway Company would take good care that the gross receipts did not exceed 4,500 per kilometre. Hakki Pasha and Sassoon Effendi said that the utmost they could do would be, while granting customs immunity on everything else for 99 years, to say that it should be granted for fuel until the Company paid 9 per cent, on its ordinary shares. Lord Inchcape said that if this was so the negotiations must be regarded as being at an end, and matters appeared to have reached a deadlock. I thereupon asked him and his solicitors to come to another room, and I went t back to Hakki Pasha and Sassoon Effendi and pointed out how serious it would be if negotiations broke down, as not only the navigation agreement, but the whole Anglo-Turkish settlement would be jeopardised. I asked him if we could not devise some compromise, and after a good deal of discussion he accepted the following arrange ment, which I then took to Lord Inchcape and which he agreed to as a great concession:— “ The exemption from customs duties on all fuel of every description is granted for a period of twenty years from the date of the signature of these presents and at the expiration of such period the Compuny shall be exempt from all customs duties on fuel in any year in which the aggregate profits of the Company distributed as dividend since the date of its incorporation are not more than sufficient to have paid an average dividend of 9 per cent, per annum on the whole of the ordinary capital of the Company in each year which has then elapsed since the date of its incorporation. “ But save as hereinbefore expressly provided to the contrary all the exemptions granted in this article are granted in perpetuity.” 3. As regards article 14, it was agreed that the statutes of the new Company should be subject to the approval of the Ottoman Government and conform as far as possible to the model type of statutes for Ottoman joint-stock companies ; but it was provided that the statutes should embody “ La franchise des droits de douane sur les combustibles est accordde pour une p&amp;iode de vingt ans a partir de la signature des presentee, et &amp; 1’expiration de ladite pdriode la Socidte sera exempte de tout droit de douane sur les com bustibles pour toute amide ou le bdndfice net de la Societe (abstraction faite de tous frais, y compris ceux d’administration, de depreciation, et les dividendes &amp; payer sur les actions de priorite et les obligations) ne ddpassera pas une somme qui aura suffi k payer un dividende moyen de 9 pour cent par an sur le montant des actions ordinaires pour toute annee ecoulee depuis la date de sa constitution. “ Sous reserve des dispositions expressement contraires des prdsentes, toutes les franchises accorddes par ce prdsent article sont accordees k perpdtuitd.”1—1 '' — . ''' ' ! ' 5 provisions consistent with all the stipulations of article 14, which, I understand, is exhaustive as regards matters of real importance. Lord Inchcape only agreed to this on condition that the concession should be signed by Thursday, the 11th December, at latest, and that the Ottoman Government would not raise difficulties in regard to the statutes, of which a copy was given to Sassoon Effendi, and that the statutes should be approved before Christmas. 4. Lord Inchcape positively declined to convey the Ottoman mails free of cost : he said it meant putting at least 8,000L a year from the pockets of the Company into those of the Ottoman Govern ment, and it would be quite impracticable to supply a cabin gratis on every steamer. Hakki Pasha and Sassoon Effendi were very bitter about this and said it would create a most unfavourable impression at Constantinople. Lord Inchcape said he had made such a valuable concession with regard to customs duties for 40 out of 60 years that he could make no further concession. As it was, Sassoon Effendi would return to Constantinople with not less that 200,0001. of customs dues, and he could not have 8,000L a year for mails as well. I rather think, however, that Lord Inchcape may agree to convey up to one ton a month of mail matter at a reduction of 50 per cent, on the ordinary cargo rates if everything else goes through without a hitch, including the statutes. As to the right to convey foreign mails, it was agreed that it should be stipulated in the con cession that such conveyance should not take place without the assent of the Ottoman Govern ment, but that Hakki Pasha should address a note to Sir E. Grey saying that the Ottoman Government would agree to the British mails being conveyed on Lord Inchcape’s steamers if His Majesty’s Government so desired. This note wxndd not be published. The interview, which had lasted nearly five hours, then terminated ; and it is agreed that Hakki Pasha, Sassoon Effendi, Sir H. Johnson, Mr. Hotblack and I are to meet again at noon to-morrow in order to settle the drafting, and that Sassoon Effendi will leave for Constanti nople on Saturday with Hakki Pasha’s report and strong recommendation to the Ottoman Govern ment to accept the draft concession as it stands. He will request telegraphic instructions.I really think we have now impressed both Hakki Pasha and Sassoon Effendi with the seriousness of the position ; but I think a copy of this minute should be sent by post to Sir L. Mallet with the amended concession and that he should be asked to exercise pressure at Constanti nople with a view to a signature next week. I am positive that Lord Inchcape will throw up the whole thing if the concession is not signed with out 'delay, and I had the greatest dilhculty in preventing him from breaking oft negotiations to-day.

Messrs. Slaughter and May to Foreign Office.—(Received December 3.) 18, Austin Friars, London, Sir, December 3, 1913. WE have now received instructions to enable us to reply to your letter of the 15th ultimo. As you are aware, the sudden death of Mr. H. F. B. Lynch since the receipt of that letter has been the cause of the delay in answering it. We are now instructed to inform you that Mr. John F. Lynch has been elected chairman of the Euphrates and Tigris Company of which he has been a director for the last twenty years. He is a son of the late Mr. Stephen Lynch, a former chairman of the company. He has also been a member of the firm of Lynch Brothers for twenty-five years and equal partner for sixteen years in that firm with the late Mr. H. F. B. Lynch. Subject to a working agreement being arranged between the new Ottoman Company and the British Company mentioned in Sir Edward Grey’s proposals of the 19th May last, the Board of the British Company and Mr. John F. Lynch instruct us to say that, subject to the very slight qualification of condition No. 6 mentioned below, they will accept the conditions laid down in your letter now under reply which are as follows :— 1. “ Assuming the capital of the new Ottoman Company allotted at the first allotment to be 100,000L, one-half would be allotted to Turkish interests. 2. “ Any German participation would have to be met altogether by the allotment of Turkish shares, and not independently of such shares. 3. “The remaining half would be British, and Lord Inchcape would offer to Mr. Lynch or his nominees participation to the extent of 20,000L or 40 per cent, of this British capital. 4. “ The sum of 6,0001. in cash will be paid by Lord Inchcape to Mr. Lynch, partly in consideration of the emoluments and management of the Belgian Company, and partly of proposal 4 in the list contained in the memorandum of the 19th May. 5. “ The remaining 30,000b of the British share, paid up in the same proportion as the 20,000b referred to above, would be held by Lord Inchcape and his nominees.- (&gt;. “ The foregoing arrangements will be conditional on the joint management firm having the management of the Belgian Company as well as that of the British Company and the proposed Ottoman Company, and the emoluments of management of all three companies. In this connection I am to express the hope that it may subsequently be found practicable to arrange for the acquisition by the new Ottoman Company of the undertaking of the Societe de Transports fluviaux en Orient on equitable terms, but not in such manner as to modify the distribution of interests in the Ottoman Companv. “Lord Inchcape will also have the power of directing that the British directors of the proposed Ottoman Company shall, should he deem it advisable, vote in block. As regards the joint management company, it would be stipulated that he should in the unlikely event of disagreement have the right to a casting vote. His Lordship would, as Mr. Lynch is already aware, further expect to have a seat on the Board of the Euphrates and Tigris Company.” With regard to the condition that Lord Inchcape shall have the right of a casting vote on the Board of the Management Company,{they do not see their way to accept this, although they would be prepared to agree that in the improbable event of disagreement any matter in dispute might be referred for decision to a referee wdio would be unofficial and independent of both companies, and that such referee should be named in the working agreement. With regard to paragraph 4 above relating to the 5,000b “ partly in consideration of the emoluments and management of the Belgian Company, and partly of proposal 42 in the list contained in the memorandum of the 19th May,” our clients desire to point out that that sum merely represents the loss sustained owing to the transference of the management of the Belgian Company, and that it would seem that no account has been taken of the expenses amounting to more than 3,000h incurred by the Euphrates and Tigris Company in 1907-9 in connection with the negotiations at Constantinople for %- the concession which has now been granted to Lord Inchcape, but they do not wish to do more than call attention to the foregoing as a matter of fact and not in any * contentious spirit. We are also directed to inform you that wdth regard to the Belgian Company, the Board of the Euphrates and Tigris Company and Mr. dohn F. Lynch are agreed that the management of this concern shall be undertaken by the Joint Management Company provided that such course is found agreeable to the Board of the Belgian Company, and our clients would use their best endeavours to bring this about. With regard to the hope expressed in paragraph 6 of your letter now under reply “ that it may subsequently be found practicable to arrange for the acquisition by the new Ottoman Company of the undertaking of the Societe de Transports fluviaux on equitable terms, but not in such manner as to modify the distribution of interests in the Ottoman Company,” we are instructed to say that the Board of the British Company have no objection to such procedure being adopted in the future if such acquisition can he so arranged. With regard to offering Lord Inchcape a seat on the Board of the British Company we are instructed to inform you that the Board of that Company will be pleased to accept this proposal especially in view of the fact that a seat was offered to the late Mr. H. F. B. Lynch on the Board of the new Ottoman Company, and it is assumed that, in the view of paragraph 2 of Sir Edward Grey’s proposals of the 19th May, 1913, this arrangement will^be held to apply to his successor in the chair of the Board of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company. Our clients ask us to state that in the event of an arrangement being arrived at on the lines above indicated they are prepared to give to His Majesty’s Government the guarantees asked for in Sir Edward Grey’s proposals of the 19th May, 1913, In conclusion we are asked by our clients to express the hope that finality in the matter may now be reached and that no further contentions will arise.

Euphrates and Tigris Navigation. Minute by Mr. Parker. MR. SLAUGHTER, solicitor to the late Mr. H. E. B. Lynch, called to-day by appointment. He said that on looking through the correspondence it appeared nominally as if he had been acting on behalf of Mr. Lynch individually, hut in point of fact he had been acting for Mr. Lynch as senior partner in Messrs. Lynch Brothers and as Chair man of the Euphrates and Tigris Navigation Company. Mr. Slaughter had received a visit from Mr. John Lynch (who he said was better known in the city as the Rajah of Bong) asking him to continue to act, and he intended to obtain a resolution of the Company asking him to do so, and a similar letter from Messrs. Lynch Brothers. Mr. Slaughter then said that he thought Mr. John Lynch would be easier to deal with than his cousin ; in fact Mr. John Lynch had, in measured terms, confided to Mr. Slaughter that he did not always see eye to eye with his cousin. The Euphrates and Tigris Company proposed now to elect Sir Walter Lawrence to a seat on their Board, and Mr. John Lynch had said that they were prepared to give Lord Inchcape a seat on it, and that they considered the terms stated in the Foreign Office letter of the 15th November to Messrs. Slaughter and May to be just and liberal, subject only to one or two minor points of detail, and to an arrangement, from which Lord Inchcape himself was understood not to be averse, providing for reference to arbitration in the event of disagreement on the joint management company. Mr. Slaughter asked j me if he might reply to our letter of the 15th November as having been an offer to Mr. Lynch qua senior partner of Messrs. Lynch Brothers and Chairman of the Euphrates and Tigris Company. I said that I thought, so far as the Foreign Office was concerned, he might. Mr. Slaughter then asked me to pface before Sir E. Grey a very positive assurance on his part that he had strongly advised the late Mr. H. F. B. Lynch not to go to Constantinople, and I told him [1930 ee —1] jj —n2 that Sir E. Grey was fully convinced on this point already. In the afternoon Lord Inchcape called with his solicitor, Sir Henry Johnson, in order to discuss certain modifications desired by Hakki Pasha in the concession of the proposed Ottoman company. These are matters of detail which it is not neces sary for me to enter into here, but Lord Inchcape took the opportunity to say that he could not now entirely abide by the terms of the Foreign Office letter of the 15th November to Messrs. Slaughter I and May (copy annexed). He said that it wuruld only be possible for him to agree to those terms if he were elected Chairman of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, as he could not possibly sit under the Chairmanship of any other members of the Board, Sir Charles Nichol son, Bart., who was an architect, Colonel Picot, who was a soldier, Mr. John Lynch, who was a commercial nonentity, or Sir Walter Lawrence, who was an ex-Civil Servant who had taken up directorships in later life, but who had no practical knowledge of trade or steamship management, though he was now r a director of the P. and 0. I said to Lord Inchcape that I regarded this statement as rather disconcerting ; no doubt the Company would be better run and the profits would be larger, if he were in the chair, but the Lynch connection might have sentimental reasons for not abandoning the Chairmanship, and I felt it would be very difficult, though I was not ex pressing anything but a personal opinion, for His Majesty’s Government to bring pressure to bear upon the Euphrates and Tigris Company in the direction desired. We had, as the ostensible reason for not pro posing Mr. Lynch as the concessionnaire for the new Company, stated that Sir E. Grey wished to broaden the existing monopoly; this would almost preclude us from urging upon the Euphrates and Tigris Company what wxmld be a virtual monopoly now; but wdiile we could take no official action in the direction desired, I thought it not very likely that we should inter vene officially to prevent such a measure if, by consent of the shareholders of the Euphrates and Tigris Company, Lord Inchcape were elected to the Chairmanship. Lord Inchcape, who was very determined, thereupon decided to ask Mr. Slaughter to call 1upon him and discuss the matter. The former has just now telephoned to me to say that he has had a most satisfactory interview with Mr. Slaughter, whom he informed that he would be prepared to take over the whole of Mr. s H. F. B. Lynch’s holding in the Euphrates and Tigris Company at a fair valuation to be made by Mr. Lynch’s executors, provided he could be elected to the Chairmanship. Mr. Slaughter had fully appreciated the position and said he would see Mr. John Lynch to-morrow and strongly support Lord Inchcape’s proposal, which he thought very reasonable from Lord Inchcape’s point of view, and very desirable from the point of view of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company. I have been very careful not to commit the Foreign Office in my communications with Lord Inchcape, for while personally I think the solution proposed would be the best in the interests of trade in general and of the Companies concerned, it is perhaps better to consult the Board of Trade, and I have accordingly communicated a copy of this minute to that Department privately. Lord Inchcape told me that his reports from Basra were to the effect that the administration of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company was in a state of great disorder. A. P. November 28, 1913.4 Appendix. [51939] Foreign Office to Messrs. Slaughter and May. GentLmTn* 1 ' 1611 * 131 ^ Foreign Office, November 15, 1913. I AM ’directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to state that, as you are probably aware, he is in receipt of a communication from Mr. H. F. B Lynch, dated the 29th October, enclosing a memorandum by Mr. Slaughter, on the subject of arrangements in connection with the navigation of the Rivers Tigris and Eup nates. With, reference to this commnnication from your client, I am to say that, without entering into controversy, Sir E. Grey is unable to accept the accounts given m the documents referred to either as complete or as entirely accurate so far as they relate to the attitude or action of this Department. . . „ . With regard to the question of including the emoluments arising from the management of the Belgian company (the Societe des Transports fluviaux) as part of the revenues of the proposed joint management company it that m the proposals contained in the Foreign Office memorandum of the 19th h ay no mention was made of the Belgian company, and it is observed that Mr Lynch s proposals of the 13th August were themselves silent as regards this subject. It appeared, however, reasonable to suppose that there would be distinct advantages m extending the operations of the management company, if established, to the management of the Societe des Transports fluviaux, and that such an arrangement would indeed be equitable, and an intimation was accordingly conveyed by Mr. Parker to Mr. blaughter at the meeting at the Foreign Office on the 8th September. Mr. Parker then stated that Sir E. Grey considered that the management company should, if possible, have the management, and emoluments consequent thereon, of the Societe des Transports fluviaux (the company entrusted with the conveyance of the material for the Bagdad Railway), and that Lord Inchcape should participate equally with Mr. Lynch in those emoluments. Mr. Lynch and yourself cannot be unaware that in so far as the proposals put forward by your client on the 13th August were more advantageous to him than those contained in Sir E. Grey’s memorandum, they cannot be lopked upon as merely supplementary to the latter, but must to that extent be considered in the fight o additional proposals necessitating some modification of those originally made from this Department. n . , As regards the position in respect of the Societe des Transports nuviaux, which a considerable portion of Mr. Slaughter’s memorandum is devoted, the fact ^ a the transfer of its management to the proposed joint management company mig involve some pecuniary loss to your client has not been overlooked, but it is presume that you are aware that the undertaking of the company in question is of a IF 1 ^ temporary character. It has been stipulated by His Majesty’s Government t a, e operations of the company shall cease on the completion of the construction o the Bagdad Railway and that its vessels shall forthwith be removed from lur is internal waterways, and in these conditions your client has acquiesced (see letter a the 27th March, 1912, from Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company a Foreign Office reply of the 6th May, 1912). It is probable that this period wi a arrived in about five years’ time, so that whatever the emoluments of the ma 1 I !^ e ^ 1 of the undertaking maybe they have to be considered with this important qnali and, further, any temporary loss which might be caused to Mr. Lynch m tins ^ would, in Sir E. Grey’s opinion, probably be much more than offset by the P e ^ aI1 ^ e gain accruing to him from equal participation in the profits of managemen new Ottoman company, which are likely in the course of time to exceed t e p of management of the Euphrates and Tigris Steamship Company. j. While therefore Sir E. Grey is not prepared to urge upon Lord Inc ca P e ^ oge the entire advantages set out in his memorandum of the 19th P US , v01ir contained in Mr. Lynch’s proposals of the 13th August, should be concede ^ client, he has, nevertheless, been in communication with his Lordship witn a vtes, ^sokast 2flts arisiii: 'ta flmili i is tme | ) li lit r.

These are as follows :— 1. Assuming the capital of the new Ottoman company allotted at the allotment to be 100,000L, one-half would be allotted to Turkish interests. , 2- Any German participation would have to be met altogether by the allotment or lurkish shares, and not independently of such shares. 1 gaining half would be British, and Lord Inchcape would offer to Mr. Lynch, or his nominees participation to the extent of 20,OOOZ., or 40 per cent., of this British capital. sum of 5,000L in cash will be paid by Lord Inchcape to Mr. Lynch, partly m consideration of the emoluments and management of the Belgian company and partly of proposal 4 in the list contained in the memorandum of the 19th May. share, paid up in the same proportion as the 20,000/. referred to above, would be held by Lord Inchcape and his nominees. . {li® foregoing arrangements will be conditional on the joint management firm havmg the management of the Belgian company as well as that of the British company and the proposed Ottoman company, and the emoluments of management of all three companies. ^ In this connection I am to express the hope that it may subsequently be found practicable to arrange for the acquisition by the new Ottoman company of' the undertaking of the Societe des Transports fluviaux on equitable terms, but nothin such manner as to modify the distribution of interests in the Ottoman company. Lord Inchcape will also have the power of directing that the British directors of the proposed Ottoman company shall, should he deem it advisable, vote in block. As regards the joint management company, it would be stipulated that he should, in the unlikely event of disagreement, have the right to a casting vote.. His Lordship would, as Mr. Lynch is already aware, further expect to have a seat on the board of the Euphrates and Tigris Company. It is possible, though Sir E. Grev hopes that the contingency may not arise, that objection may be taken by Ottoman' or German interests to the transfer of the management of the new Ottoman company to the joint management company proposed to be formed by Lord Inchcape and your'client alone, and, in that event, some modification of the scheme might be necessary in order to conciliate those interests. That possibility does not, however, affect the negotiations between your client and Lord Inchcane. and. after t.hfi fullpst. pnnairloT'Q+inT-i car n&lt;QwaiQ Cirey is or opinion tliat a settlement on the lines indicated above would be equitable and in the interests of British trade in general.

As regards (3), I said that the concession precluded the Society des Transports fluviaux from carrying cargo downwards. R appears to me that Mr. Lynch, in dictating Mr. Slaughters letter of the 25th September, had in view the raising of difficulties more than anything else, and that his object was simply to worry.

Grey’s opinion, that it would be madvisab e to communicate to Mr. Lynch the full terms of Lord Inchcape’s concession until it has been finally signed on behalf of the Ottoman Government At the same time they recognise that Mr. Lynch cannot be expected to discuss arrange ments tor the formation of a company for the management of the Euphrates and Tigris Company and Lord Inchcape s undertaking unless he is fully acquainted with the condi tions under which the latter undertaking is to be carried on. * In these circumstances, the Board can only suggest, for Sir E. Grey’s consideration, that every effort should be made to secure the signature of the concession at the earliest possible date. As regaids the first of the three points to which special reference is made in your lettei under reply, I am to state that the Board are in some doubt as to the meaning ot the phrase “upkeep of the waterways ’ used in Mr. Lynch’s letter of the 22nd September to Mr. Slaughter. If it refers solely to measures for the conservancy of the river above Basra, sufficient provision in this respect would appear to be made by articles 1 (c) and 10 of the draft concession; if, however, it refers to the maintenance of a navigable waterway, unaffected by future irrigation works (a question which played an important part in previous negotiations for a combination of the river services), the Board are not aware of any safeguard other than the financial interest whLh the Ottoman Government will have in the new navigation company. . The question of facilities on the railways beyond Bagdad for water-borne traffic is, m the opinion of the Board, sufficiently dealt with by articles 1 and 2 of the Anglo- Turkish Convention regarding railways in Asiatic Turkey and clause (6) of article 2 of the draft Anglo-German Agreement, Those provisions are in wide terms, and would appeal to furnish adequate ground for intervention in the event of any discrimination against water-borne traffic, such as Mr. Lynch appears to contemplate. Finally, as regards the carriage of downward freight by the vessels of the Socidte de Transports fluviaux, the Board have nothing to add to their letter of the 2nd September, and they concur in the course which, as indicated in your letter under reply, Sir E. Grey proposes to take in this matter. At the same time, I am to point out that the fact that it is thought undesirable to give a definite answer on the point is a further reason why His Majesty’s Government should press for the signature of the the concession at an early date.

I hope this will be sufficient to enable you to answer the last German note. I had already clearly explained to the Grand Vizier Hakki Pasha’s initiative in the matter of German participation.

His Highness expressed the view that it was natural that the railway company should desire some participation in the river navigation, whereupon it was carefully explained to him that such participation could not come out of the British shares. lie said he appreciated this, and himself suggested that we should, in our agreement with Germany, propose that His Majesty s Government' would not oppose ” Germany acquiring one-third of the Turkish shares. I fully agree with your Excellency that the Germans should negotiate direct with lurkey on the subject, but they have communicated to me a counter-draft to the one I proposed on 18th September, and a reply has to be sent. I had no wish originally to admit Germans, but I am doubtful if they would have acquiesced m creation of a monopoly without participating in it. I consider it impracticable to exclude them at this late stage, but until the Ottoman Government make up then minds as to what they will agree to, all negotiations must remain in suspense ; this_ causes serious inconvenience, as the Anglo-Turkish agreements cannot be ratified until the Turco-German negotiations are concluded, and I do not wish to postpone date of ratifications again.

[May 7.] CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1, [Amended Copy.] [21191] No. 1. Minute by Mr. Parker. I CALLED at the German Embassy to-day and Herr von Kuhlmann explained to d 0 ° f tlie Government in regard to certain matters touching the Bagdad Railway, Turkish finance, and river navigation in Mesopotamia. I asked him to allow me to make notes, as the subjects are involved, and I pointed out that I had come to listen to his remarks and had of course no proposals to make. The substance of his remarks was as follows :— 1. I he Bagdad Railway Company would prefer to build and manage the section from Bagdad to Basra themselves rather than abandon that section to another Company. The Company did not, under the arrangement of 1911, definitely abandon their rights to do this ; they at that time merely made a declaration of their readiness to do so subject to two conditions, viz. : that the Bagdad Railway Company’s interest in the new Company should be equal to that of any nation other than Turkey, and that the Bagdad Railway Company should receive compensation for the renunciation of rights secured to them under the original concession. 2. If His Majesty’s Government agree to point (1), then the Societe would be prepared to agree that:— (a.) The sections from Basra to the Gulf should be indefinitely postponed. (b.) If those sections ever should be built the Societe would like to share in the building of them, but would not ask to share in the subsequent management of the sections, but there must be adequate guarantees as regards through traffic. (c.) That Basra should be the terminus of the line. (d.) That the construction and control of the port at Basra should be the subject of an agreement with his Majesty’s Government. (e.) That two British directors should be admitted to the Board of the Railway from Konia to Basra. 3. The German Government would confirm these proposals of the Societe. They would also agree that German subjects should make no claim to participate in navigation on the Euphrates and Tigris. If a reasonable and fair arrangement can be made for the conveyance of materials for the railway while building, then the Germans would forthwith abandon any claim to navigation on those rivers. If, however, for some technical reason, such an arrangement cannot be made as regards building material, &amp;c., then the German Government would undertake that German subjects shall not participate in any navigation company on the two rivers after, say, five years from 1913. 4. If the German Government and the Societe agree that the terminus shall be Basra, they will expect an undertaking from His Majesty’s Government and the Ottoman Government that the Shatt-el-Arab shall be kept in a satisfactory state of conservancy, so that sea-going vessels without discrimination of flag shall always be assured of easy access to Basra on equal conditions. 5. The German Government would appreciate a confidential intimation as to the attitude of His Majesty’s Government towards the Bagdad Railway enterprise on the conclusion of such an arrangement as that in question. 6. The German Government wishes co-operation between the German and British delegates on the Financial Commission at Paris, so as to secure :— (a.) That the Bagdad Railway Company shall receive fresh and equally good security for any revenues now pledged to the company and which Turkey may forfeit as the result of the war (e.g., the Salonica customs duties surplus). [2917 2-1]2 (6.)

[September 18.] CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1, [42832] No. 1. Memorandum communicated to German Charge d’Affaires, September 18, 1913. HIS Majesty s Government Lave examined with close attention the counter-draft, communicated by the German Ambassador on the 16th July, 1913, of the proposed Anglo-German convention respecting the Bagdad Railway and cognate matters , they have also considered the various memoranda which accompanied this document, and the detailed explanations which His Serene Highness was good enough to furnish in a private note of the same date. Sir E. Grey now has the honour to submit a revised counter-draft, printed, for the sake of convenience, with the German counter-draft in parallel columns, and to deal with the several points which have been raised by referring, where necessary, seriatim to the articles of the British counter-draft. Article 1, Clause [a). —The German Govern ment suggest that the words u under the express condition that this should not cause any prejudice of a financial or economical nature ” might be omitted. His Majesty’s Government consider, however, that without such words the clause might be interpreted as committing them, uncon ditionally and indefinitely, to liability not to oppose any increases of the Turkish customs duties which might be proposed, or any alloca tions of specific revenues which might be claimed, if such increases or allocations were ever deemed desirable, either to provide further guarantees for, or in any other interest of, the Bagdad Railway Company. Article 1, Clause (6).—His Majesty’s Govern ment note that the German Government would prefer the drafting of this clause to be in a positive rather than a negative form, though such a modification would not materially alter the nature of the obligation concurred. His B [1863 5—1]2 Majesty’s Government have given this point careful consideration, hut, on the whole, it appears to them expedient to retain the wording of the British counter-draft ; this wording corresponds, moreover, with the undertaking the German Government propose to give m article 4 (a) as regards the navigation of the Rivers Tigris and Euphrates. Article 1, Clause (c).—His Majesty s Govern ment attach importance to the insertion of this provision. The undertaking to be given by the German Government Under the proposed wording is merely that they will use their best endeavours ” for the purpose stated ; but His Majesty’s Government appreciate the technical difficulty that the German Government cannot theoretically ensure the election of the directors in question without the co-operation of the Bagdad Railway Company ; and they are accordingly prepared to agree that if and when a British group is formed, the arrangements sug gested in Prince Lichnowsky’s note would be satisfactory to them. The question, however, whether a British group can be successfully formed must necessarily depend on the financial conditions of participation. His Majesty’s Government accordingly rely upon the German Government using their powerful influence to prevent the imposition of such conditions by the Bagdad Railway Company as would make participation unattractive to British financiers, and so frustrate the object of the clause under discussion, viz., British representation on the directorate. They do not believe that the prospects laid by Herr von Gwinner before Sir H. Babington Smith on the 14th June, 1913, as to the conditions of British participation are likely to result in a settlement. Article 2.—The preamble of this article has been amended so as to meet the proposal embodied in clause (a) of article 7 of the German counter-draft, and in order that the conclusion of the proposed arrangement between the Bagdad Railway Company and the Ottoman Government may be treated as a preliminary to the signature of the Anglo-German convention, a point to which His Majesty’s Government attach primary importance. Article 2, Clause (a), corresponds to the German counter-draft. Article 2, Clause (b), corresponds to the German3 counter-draft ; but His Majesty’s Government would, as the German Charge d’Affaires has already been informed, value an assurance (which might either be added to this clause, or given by an exchange of notes, should the German Government deem such a course to be Railway and of all intended changes therein, and that the notice to be given of such changes will not be less than two months in the case of both increases and decreases. counter-draft. His Majesty’s Government have carefully considered the statement of Prince Lichnowsky that the German Government would prefei able) that there will be effective publica tion of all rates and conditions on the Bagdad Article 2, Clause (c), corresponds to the Germantotal shipping (the steam vessels entered and cleared at that port during the year 1912 having been 217 British, 12 German, 5 Russian, and 1 French), His Majesty’s Government confidently believe that the degree of participation claimed will be regarded as very moderate, and indeed as highly desirable in the general interests of the port. His Majesty’s Government further consider it desirable that the principal conditions as to the formation and operation of the port at Basra should be laid down in the present convention. Article 3, Clause {a), corresponds to the German counter-draft. Article 3, Clause (6), gives effect to article 3 of the original British draft of 10th June, 1913 : this article is ignored in the German counter- draft, but it constitutes, in the view of His Majesty’s Government, a most important and essential condition of the present convention. Without it, the provisions of article 2, clause (a), and article 3, clause (a), are illusory, and might, if it were so desired, be rendered nugatory. Inasmuch as a principal object of His Majesty s Government in concluding the present convention is to guard against such a port or railway terminus on the Persian Gulf, except on conditions subject to their approval, they trust the German Government, who by reason of the railway interests of German subjects are specially concerned, will not take exception to this clause. It may be said without exaggeration that the attitude of His Majesty’s Government throughout the present negotiations has been largely deter mined by the belief that they were effectively providing against the contingency under discussion. Article 3, Clause (c).—His Majesty’s Govern ment recognise, however, that the German Government may feel some disinclination to agree to the provisions of article 3 of the British draft of the 10th June, 1913, if that article stands alone. They have accordingly redrafted article 3 in such a manner that clause (a) is a mutual undertaking, clause (6) is a German undertaking, and clause (c) is a British undertaking. Clause (c) may, in some measure, be regarded as a set-off against clause (6). . Clause (c) is, moreover, designed to meet the object, under a more precise definition, of clause (c) of article 1 of the German counter-draft. Clause (c) of article 3 does not compare unfavour-5 ably with clause (b) of the same article, when it is borne in mind that British trade in Mesopo tamia amounts to some 60 per cent, of the whole. Having regard to this commercial predominance. His Majesty’s Government have felt compelled to limit their inaction to “ railway undertakings in direct competition with the Bagdad Company’s lines ” (as projected, of course, under the existing concessions), and they would have hesitated to agree even to this stipulation, had they not enter tained complete confidence in the German assurances as to equality of treatment on that railway. They trust, however, that the concession offered under clause (c), in the interests of the Bagdad Railway Company, will induce that Company, and the affiliated Anatolian Railway Company, to adopt a conciliatory and favourable attitude towards certain desiderata of the Smyrna-Aidin Railway Company. These desiderata, which have been placed before the Ottoman Govern ment, include an option for an eventual junction of that Company’s line with the Anatolian Company’s system, on conditions to be mutually agreed between the two companies. Inasmuch as the Anatolian Railway Company is already connected with Smyrna by the Smyrna-Cassaba Company’s line, it would seem that there can be no objection of principle to such a junction as that proposed with the Smyrna-Aidin Company’s system, and to the establishment of facilities for through traffic. His Majesty’s Government feel that they can, with the more assurance, claim the co-operation of the German Government in bringing about such a settlement, as the Smyrna-Aidin line is the only remaining railway under British management in Turkey. They are further persuaded that, in considering this very moderate request, the German Government will not over look the fact that, in the recent adjustment of certain railway claims in Turkey, His Majesty’s Government have not only refrained for the present from claiming fresh railway concessions in favour of British subjects, but have even furthered, to the best of their ability, the adjust ment in question. Article 4.—His Majesty’s Government appreci ate the German objection to the idea of a monopoly, but it must not be overlooked that the Bagdad Railway is itself of the nature of a [1863 6—1] C6 monopoly, a fact which is emphasised by article 3, clause (c). Moreover, a monopoly of navigation exists already, and it appears to His Majesty’s Government that Germany, who now has no rights on the Rivers Tigris and Euphrates beyond the carriage of railway material during the period of construction, is losing nothing more than the prospect of participation in the very improbable event of Turkey throwing the rivers open, for which uncertain prospect she is, accord ing to article 4, to be compensated by an actual share in a very profitable if exclusive under taking. It seems to His Majesty’s Government, therefore, that the objection raised in Prince Lichnowsky’s note can be answered, and they do not feel able to amend the Anglo-Turkish declaration in the manner suggested. Article 4, clause (a ).—The second sub-clause of the German counter-draft appears, in these cir cumstances, to be superfluous, and it is, in the opinion of His Majesty’s Government, in itself objectionable, as appearing to put German and British interests on the rivers on an equality, a conclusion to which His Majesty’s Government could on no account assent, having regard to the fact that the rivers have been navigated by British vessels for well-nigh three centuries, and that such navigation has taken place by virtue of special and ancient firmans. An addition has, however, been made to clause (a) which, it is hoped, will secure to the German Government such further protection as they consider desirable. Article 4, clause (b ).—Prince Lichnowsky refers in his note to “ the desire to establish a parallel ” with British participation in the ports of Bagdad and Basra. The parallel would now be con fined to such participation in the latter port; but even so there would seem to be little analogy between participation in a single port company, and participation in the lucrative enterprise of extensive and exclusive river navigation. Notwithstanding the basis of agreement sug gested on the 7th May, 1913, His Majesty’s Govern ment are, after careful consideration, prepared to agree not to oppose German interests in acquiring not more than (as distinct from not less than) one- third of the share-capital allotted to Turkish interests in the Ottoman Company for river navigation. They are confident that this im portant concession, over and above the terms of agreement suggested in the memorandum ofthe 7th May, 1913, will be borne in mind by the German Government in considering the points to which His Majesty’s Government, on their part, attach weight. Article 4, Clause (c). —His Majesty’s Govern ment attach cardinal importance to a specific limitation of five years, and to the reservations embodied in the British draft. But, in view of the final paragraph of this clause, they trust that an agreement of the nature indicated may be reached between the parties interested, in vdiich case the wording of the clause in question could be revised. Article 5 of the British counter-draft calls for no explanations, except that the preamble has, so far as applicable, been based upon that of article 2 . Article 6 corresponds to articles 5 and 6 of the German counter-draft. Having regard to the fact that the whole water way of the Shatt-el-Arab is Turkish, it appears to His Majesty’s Government that the wording of article 5 of the German counter-draft might perhaps somewhat offend Ottoman susceptibilities. The wording of article 5 of the British draft of the 10th June, 1913, was based upon the fact that the Ottoman Government, recognising the practical services rendered through British agency in maintaining access to the port of Basra in the past, w^ere prepared to conclude an agree ment with His Majesty’s Government on the lines known to the German Government. His Majesty’s Government have considered very carefully the proposal to establish a “ comite de surveillance ” contained in article 6 of the German counter-draft, but they are persuaded that the inconvenience which would arise from the co-existence of two bodies would be detri mental to the interests of navigation. They confidently believe, however, that the wording of article 6 of the British counter-draft w iH, i n effect, meet the points to which the German Government attach importance. Article i . His Majesty s Government trust that this article may be suppressed for the reasons explained in the notes printed opposite the several clauses of the German counter-draft. They desire to conclude a definite and operative convention with the German Government, and not one which is to remain in suspended animation.Article 8 corresponda to the German counter- draft. His Majesty’s Government earnestly trust that the views expressed in this memorandum will command the willing assent of the German Government. They are persuaded that an Anglo-German understanding on the lines proposed will contribute to the permanent strength, the independence, and the economic development of the Ottoman Empire, and that this is an object to the attainment of which Great Britain and Germany can successfully and whole heartedly co-operate.

I write now to say that, after very careful consideration and consultation with our Railway Depart ment, it does not appear to us to be possible for His Majesty's Goverment to take any action In this matter. The purpose of the provisions as to rates introduced into the agreements referred to above is to insure British goods against discrimination of any sort, not to protect the river companies against railway competition. Differentiation of the kind contemplated is a not un comuonuncommon feature of traffic competition, and it would be scarcely possible to argue that It is unreasonable or 'unfair*. And it would be very difficult to frame a provision directed against such differentiation, which could be defended in argument. The point was not overlooked when the articles in the agreements were being drafted, but the rather vague provisions of Article 4 as in the Anglo-Turkish Conven tion seemed to be the best we could devise as protection against unfair discrimination of any kind Yours very truly, (Signed) Percy Ashley.in any further comamn^a- tion on this subject, please quote no.

Hakki Pasha said to me to-day that the groat dif ficulty in the river concession was the desired stipula tion as to the British and Turkish members of the Board voting in block, should Lord Inchcape so decide. He said the necessity for such an arrangement appealed to rest entirely upon the danger of ivir.lynch acting in an unpatriotic manner, and the obvious solution was, if this were so, the exclusion of ur.Lynch. In any case he had done nothing but intrigue for months, and he would be a constant element of trouble on the Board of the new company, hindering its working at every turn. Mr. Lynch was an Armenian and, as he had remarked to me before, an Armenian differed from a Jew in that ho went on intriguing even when it was to his own detriment to do so. Surely Mr.Lynch had forfeited all claim to the support of His Majesty’s Government by his recent mis conduct. Hakki Pasha was convinced, though he could not of course say so officially, that Mr.Lynch had for months been intriguing against the concession through some agent at Constantinople, and that the delay in signingsigning the concussion, and tho dimcultias vvhich were now being cruatad, wara largely duo to Mr.Lynch, who no doubt had relations with minor officialo in the Ministry of Public Works. I told Hakki Pasha that Mr.Lynch was now at Con- stantinople, and he replied that he supposed he had gone there as his attempt to gut at Tewfik Pasha through the Persian Minister in London had failed. I asked him if he could find out what Mr.Lynch was doing at Constantinople, and he said he would sand a telegram asking what business he was discussing, and would let mu know the result. Lord Inchcape tells me that even if Mr.Lynch goes out voting in block must be retained. I was not able to pursue this to-night, but I will ask Lord Inchcape the exact reason when I see him on Friday. I am to have a further meeting with Hakki Pasha about the navigation concession to-morrow morning and one with Hakki Pasha and Lord Inchcape on Friday. Meanwhile, until we hear more as to what Mr.Lynch is doing in Constantinople, no action with regard to him seems possible. Mr.Slaughter, his solicitor, is very muchmuch annoyed at his having gone, as ho advised him emphatically not to go, as the visit would certainly be liable to misconstruction. (Initialled) A.P.

Foreign Office to Messrs. Slaughter and May. (Most Confidential.) Gent j e rrv t .1 1 Q . . „ Foreign Office, November 15, 1913. . ^ directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to state that, as yon are probably aware he is m receipt of a communication from Mr. H. F. B. Lynch, dated the 29th October' enclosing a memorandum by Mr. Slaughter, on the subject of arrangements in connection with the navigation of the Rivers Tigris and Euphrates. With reference to this communication from your client, I am to say that without entering into controversy, Sir E. Grey is unable to accept the accounts given in the documents referred to either as complete or as entirely accurate so far as they relate to the attitude or action of this Department. With regard to the question of including the emoluments arising from the management of the Belgian company (the Societe des Transports fluviaux) as part of the revenues of the proposed joint management company, it is true that in the proposals contained in the Foreign Office memorandum of the 19th May no mention was made of the Belgian company, and it is observed that Mr. Lynch’s proposals of the 13th August were themselves silent as regards this subject. It appeared, however, reasonable to suppose that there would be distinct advantages in extending the operations of the management company, if established, to the management of the Societe des Transports fluviaux, and that such an arrangement would, indeed, be equitable, and an intimation was accordingly conveyed by Mr. Parker to Mr. Slaughter at the meeting at the Foreign Office on the 8th September. Mr. Parker then stated that Sir E. Grey considered that the management company should, if possible, have the management, and emoluments consequent thereon, of the Societe des Transports fluyiaux (the company entrusted with the conveyance of the material for the Bagdad Railway), and that Lord Inchcape should participate equally with Mr. Lynch in those emoluments. Mr. Lynch and yourself cannot be unaware that in so far as the proposals put forward by your client on the 13th August were more advantageous to him than those contained in Sir E. Grey’s memorandum, they cannot be looked upon as merely supplementary to the latter, but must to that extent be considered in the light of additional proposals necessitating some modification of those originally made from this Department. As regards the position in respect of the Societe des Transports fluviaux, to which a considerable portion of Mr. Slaughter’s memorandum is devoted, the fact that the transfer of its management to the proposed joint management company might involve some pecuniary loss to your client has not been overlooked, but it is presumed that you are aware that the undertaking of the company in question is of a purely temporary character. It has been stipulated by His Majesty’s Government that the operations of the company shall cease on the completion of the construction of the Bagdad Railway and that its vessels shall forthwith be removed from Turkish internal waterways, and in these conditions your client has acquiesced (see letter dated the 27th March, 1912, from Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company and Foreign Office reply of the 6th May, 1912). It is probable that this period will have arrived in about five years’ time, so that whatever the emoluments of the management of the undertaking may be they have to be considered with this important qualification ; and, further, any temporary loss which might be caused to Mr. Lynch in this matter would, in Sir E. Grey’s opinion, probably be much more than offset by the permanent gam accruing to him from equal participation in the profits of management of the new Ottoman company, which are likely in the course of time to exceed the profits of management of the Euphrates and Tigris Steamship Company. While therefore Sir E. Grey is not prepared to urge upon Lord Inchcape that the entire advantages set out in his memorandum of the 19th May, plus those contained in Mr. Lynch’s proposals of the 13th August, should be conceded to your client, he has, nevertheless, been in communication with his Lordship with a vievr to [1930 2 3—1]ascertain the nature of the arrangements to which, having regard to all the circumstances, he would he prepared to consent. These are as follows: 1 Assuming the capital of the new Ottoman company allotted at the first allotment to he 100,0001, one-half would be allotted to Turkish interests. 2. Any German participation would have to he met altogether by the allotment of Turkish shares, and not independently of such shares. 3 The remaining half would he British, and Lord Inchcape would offer to Mr. Lynch or his nominees participation to the extent of 20,000L, or 40 pei cent., of this BnBsh ^ptaL in cas p w in p e paid by Lord Inchcape to Mr. Lynch, partly in consideration of the emoluments and management of the Belgian company and partly of proposal 4 in the list contained in the memorandum of the Uth May. 5 . The remaining 30,000b of the British share, paid up m the same proportion as the 20,000b referred to above, would he held by Lord Inchcape^ and his nominees. 6 The foregoing arrangements will he conditional on the joint management firm having the management of the Belgian company as well as that of the British company and the proposed Ottoman company, and the emoluments of management of all three companies. In this connection I am to express the hope that it may subsequently be found practicable to arrange for the acquisition by the new Ottoman company of the undertaking of the -Societe des Transports fluviaux on equitable terms, but not m such manner as to modify the distribution of interests in the Ottoman company. Lord Inchcape will also have the power of directing that the British directors of the proposed Ottoman company shall, should he deem it advisable, vote in block. As regards the joint management company, it would be stipulated that he should, m the unlikely event of disagreement, have the right to a casting vote., His Lordship would, as Mr. Lynch is already aware, further expect to have a seat on the board of the Euphrates and Tigris Company. It is possible, though Sir E. Grey hopes that the contingency may not arise, that objection may be taken by Ottoman or German interests to the transfer of the management of the new Ottoman company to the joint management company proposed to be formed by Lord Inchcape and your client alone, and, in that event, some modification of the scheme might be necessary in order to conciliate those interests. That possibility does not, however, affect the negotiations between your client and Lord Inchcape, and, after the fullest consideration, Sir Edward Grey is of opinion that a settlement on the lines indicated above would be equitable and in the interests of British trade in general. He would therefore be glad to learn at an early date that Mr. Lynch is prepared to accept the proposals set out above, failing which he fears that the new Ottoman company may have to be formed independently of your client. ' , Your client will of course understand that the settlement suggested is dependent upon acceptance of the two conditions indicated in Sir E. Grey’s memorandum of the 19th May, to which the proposals contained in that memorandum were subject. I am, &amp;c. EYRE A.

M i Section 1. [49518] No. I. Foreign Office to Board of Trade. (Confidential.) Sir, Foreign Office, November 1, 1913. WITH reference to previous correspondence respecting the navigation of the Rivers Euphrates and Tigris, I am directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to transmit to you, to be laid before the Board of Trade, the accompanying copy of a letter from Mr. H. F. B. Lynch.* Sir E. Grey proposes to cause the reply to be sent to Messrs. Slaughter and May, for transmission to Mr. Lynch, on the ground, amongst others, that confusion will arise if collateral communications on the same subject are carried on with the principal person and his several representatives. As the statements contained in Mr. Lynch’s letter and in the memorandum therein enclosed are, in more than one instance, mis leading and untrue, and as experience has shown that Mr. Lynch accepts silence in regard to any of his statements as acquiescence in their accuracy, Sir E. Grey proposes to state that, without entering into controversy, he cannot accept the accounts given in The communication to Messrs. Slaughter and May would then proceed as follows:— Sir E. Grey is at a loss to understand Mr. Lynch’s present attitude towards, or of the Belgian company in the proposed joint management company. Colonel Picot, in reply to a question put by Mr. Parker to that gentleman when he had called to stated that he took it for granted that such inclusion would be arranged if an understanding were arrived at respecting joint management of Mr. Lynch’s British company and Lord Inchcape’s company. No mention was, at Colonel Picot’s request, preclude all possibility of misunderstanding, Mr. Parker wrote to Mr. Slaughter on the 2nd September, 1913, as follows :— Transports fluviaux (which is the company entrusted with the conveyance of the material for the Bagdad Railway) and that Lord Inchcape should participate equally with Mr. Lynch in those emoluments. Sir E. Grey observes that Mr. Lynch now treats his own proposals of _ the 13th August as supplementary, in so far as his own advantage and that of the British company is concerned, to those put before him on the 19th May. The Secretary of State had, however, to this extent regarded the proposals made by Mr. Lynch in August as alternative to those made in May by this Department. As the latter proposals are admittedly more lucrative to Mr. Lynch than the former, he is not prepared to urge upon Lord Inchcape that the advantages of both proposals should be conceded to Mr. Lynch. Sir E. Grey has, ho’wever, been in communication with Lord Inchcape on the subject, and he understands that his Lordship would be prepared to agree to an arrangement as follows :— Assuming the capital of the new Ottoman company to be 100,000?., one-half would he allotted to Turkisli interests, and any German participation would have to be met by the allotment of Turkish shares. The remaining half would be British, and Lord Inchcape would agree to 20,000?. being held by Mr. Lynch or the British company. Of this amount 5,000/.. would regard to the attitude or action of this Department either as complete or as entirely accurate. Mr. Slaughter’s language with reference to, the question of including the emoluments discuss the proposals made by Mr. Lynch under date of the 13th August, categorically made of this statement on his part in the record of the interview. But, in order to I am to add that Sir E. Grey considers that the management company should, if possible, have the management and emoluments consequent thereon, of the Societe des * Mr. Lynch, October 29, 1913. [1930 a—1]represent fully paid shares, which would be received by Mr. Lynch or his nominee without payment, and 15,0001 would represent partly paid shares, to be subscribed for by Mr Lynch or his nominee. Thirty thousand pounds, paid up m the same proportion as the'last-named shares, would be held by Lord Inchcape and his nominees. This arrangement is conditional on the joint management firm having the managcp ment of the Belgian company as well as that of the British company and of the proposed Ottoman company, and the emoluments of management of all three companies. Lord Inchcape will also have the power of directing that the British shareholders of the proposed Ottoman company shall, should he deem it advisable, vote in block; and, as regards the joint management company, and in the unlikely event of dis agreement, he would have the right to a casting vote. His Lordship would, as Mr. Lynch is already aware, further expect to have a seat on the board of the Euphrates and Tigris company. i v , , . , Sir E. Grey wishes it to be clearly understood that a settlement on these lines (which, as regards Mr/Lynch’s participation in the new Ottoman company, corresponds with the views of the Board of Trade as conveyed to Mr. Slaughter in Mr. Parker’s letter of the 2nd September), represents the maximum of concessions which he is prepared to urge upon Lord Inchcape in favour of Mr. Lynch and the British company; that, in the event of Mr. Lynch being unable to accept this settlement, which is one which appears eguitable and m the interests of British trade m general, he would then, though wdth regret, be compelled to advise Lord Inchcape to terminate negotiations with Mr. Lynch and to constitute the Ottoman company independently. Finally, I am to state that the settlement suggested is strictly conditional on the two points indicated in the memorandum of the 19th May, to which the proposals then made were subject. Sir E. Grey would be glad to be furnished at an early date with the observations of the Board of Trade on this draft letter, which has been written after consultation with Lord Inchcape, and which it is hoped need not be despatched pending the signature of the concession.

Mr. Ijynch to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received October 31.) Dear Grey, 33, Pont Street, London, October 29, 1913. YOU may remember that on the 1st, and again on the 6th, May last I wrote to you, asking for a personal interview concerning matters which, while they concerned important British interests in the East, closely affected the commercial interests with which I am connected. You replied, on the 3rd May, expressing your inability to see me owing to pressure of work, and, on the 8th May, after I had proposed to defer the interview until the pressure had been relieved, to the effect that the matter was not one on which you could give me a personal interview, but that it would always be arranged that I should communicate what I had to say to an official in your Department who would be fully conversant with the matter. From that date up to the present time, I have consistently followed the course prescribed by you. Up to the end of June I had several interviews with the officials of your Department and of the Board of Trade, some at their request and others at mine. After my negotiations with the Board of Trade had broken down, I asked Mr. Capel Slaughter, with whom I was not previously acquainted, but on whose judgment and wide knowledge of business I had been assured I could rely, to read all the papers and give me the benefit of his advice. As a result, Mr. Slaughter saw your private secretary on the 9th July. He submitted that, however unknowingly, it seemed to him that a grave injustice was being done to us, which we could hardly be expected to sit down under; that we could not be asked to accept from Lord Inchcape wffiat he chose to give us; and that we were willing to associate with us in the administration of the affairs, a gentleman having long official relations with the British Government. He added that he was not there for the purpose of creating trouble, but to see whether, if we sat down with willing minds to arrange a consortium with Lord Inchcape, the desired result could not be attained. Since that date Mr. Slaughter has conducted the negotiations with the officials of your Department, at their desire, as I understand. Yesterday he asked for an interview with them, with the object of conferring upon the results of the interview which took place between Lord Inchcape and myself on the 27th instant; and he desired to bring me with him, I think for obvious reasons. He has been informed that I could not be received, and that it would be preferable that any communications with him should, in future, be conducted in writing. Under these circumstances, he and I have agreed that the best course would be for me to communicate with you direct. I enclose a memorandum, which Mr. Slaughter has independently prepared, setting out, as briefly as possible the outstanding facts o± the case. Having regard to your letters of the 3rd and 8th May, I s ou c no now trouble you had I not exhausted my resources with your Department. In addition to Mr. Slaughter, I may add that I have sought the advice of only one ot ei peison a gentleman having long official relations with our Government, w ose name was mentioned by Mr. Slaughter at his interview with your private secretary on the 9th July. This gentleman visited your Department on the 21st instant, but found himself unable to advance matters further. _ __ i . ii ± \ The long gap in the active negotiations from the close of Ju y o e 0 ,? r ’’ the date of my first interview with Lord Inchcape on the oasis o my proposa 80 ® 13th August, has been due to the protracted absence of Lord Inchcape m the nortfl ot Scotland Since Lord Inchcape’s acceptance, early m September of those proposals of mine, subject to some qualifications which were not mentione , u w nc i 16 sal would like to discuss with me, I have been continually piessmg or e memorant which he promised at the same time, but which I have not even ye receive . vital interests of the British Company which I represent have, urmg a , . ’ been in suspense. With the exception of two separate weeks, I have been kept London all the summer and autumn in the hope that any day mig e a . , at a settlement which, while conforming to your views, won id safeguard the interests which I represent, and bestow upon them a reasonable sbaie in le eve opi [1908 hh —2] B A * €b Copytc 14 MOV 1913 14 NOV 1913 -'commerce which we have created. Nobody could be more anxious than myself to arrive at a reasonable arrangement with Lord Inchcape and to avoid any unpleasantness in the future. As this is a question in which the British Government have intervened, and have requested me to leave the decision in their hands, I think I have established a^ claim to their good offices for securing considerate treatment. It is evident that, now that the Germans have been conceded a share in the proposed new company, the scheme has taken a shape similar to that contemplated in the Turkish proposals of March of this year, transmitted to me by the Deutsche Bank, and by me to you, in which I was to provide the British share. You asked me not to commit myself, but to give your Department time to think the matter out, and they ultimately rejected those proposals. Though Lord Inchcape has now been put in my place by the direct action of the Department, and the Germans have been brought in, I am willing to abide by my proposals of the 13th August; but surely it is only fair that I may be allowed to ask that the qualifications of them should be restricted to matters of detail. Yours sincerely, H. F. B. LYNCH. Enclosure in No. 1. Memorandum by Mr. Slaughter in relation to the proposed New Ottoman Company {hereinafter called the Ottoman Company). The Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company (limited) (hereinafter called the British Company) and La Societe des Transports fluviaux en Orient (herein after called the Belgian Company). THE real difficulty arises because Lord Inchcape claims the concession of the Ottoman Company as his own property to do with what he likes in his uncontrolled discretion. Mr. Lynch was told that, while Lord Inchcape would be the concessionnaire, he (Mr. Lynch) was invited to negotiate on the basis of Sir Edward Grey’s proposals of the 19th May, 1913. (Copy herewith.) Those proposals expressly stated that on certain conditions the Foreign Office would use their good offices to secure to the British Company (i.e., Mr. Lynch’s company) :— 1. The right to subscribe a substantial portion of the British share of the capital of the Ottoman Company. 2. A seat on the board of the Ottoman Company. 3. A working agreement between the Ottoman Company and the British Company. 4. A payment in cash or a certain number of fully paid-up shares in the Ottoman Company (in addition to any shares subscribed under No. 1 above) in consideration of the position of the Messrs. Lynch as pioneers in the navigation of the rivers. On receipt of these proposals, Mr. Lynch saw Mr. Parker on the 21st May, 1913, with a memorandum wdiich Mr. Lynch submitted as to his views of Sir Edward Grey’s proposals. Mr. Lynch had in his original draft stated that the proposals might be construed as giving the control and management to outsiders, and that to bestow the control and management of such a concern to newcomers would be grossly unfair. Mr. Parker objected to this w 7 ay of stating it, and particularly to the words “grossly unfair,” and at his instance Mr. Lynch’s memorandum was amended so as to read: “ If the proposal involves the exclusion of Messrs. Lynch Brothers from participation in the local management, then it is, in our view, a wholly inadequate recognition of our existing position.” In Sir Edward Grey’s proposals there is no mention of the Belgian Company at all. The Belgian Company had previously been formed by Mr. Lynch, in co-operation with the Deutsche Bank, to provide a fleet to handle the transport of material for the construction of the Bagdad Hailway. The arrangements for the creation of this company had been communicated by Mr. Lynch to the Foreign Office prior to its formation ; and so much alive were the Foreign Office to its importance that they asked and obtained from Mr. Lynch, without any consideration, but as a matter of courtesy, an assurance that his company would not part with their interest in the3 EUtf fflOBlftl! Belgian Cornpany, except after ample notice to the Foreign Office (see letter of the secretary ol the British Company to the Foreign Office under date the 7th August, 1912h At the date of Sir Edward Greys proposals, Germany had renounced her right to participate in any share of the navigation of the rivers, so that the way appeared clear for the benefits of the navigation to be divided between Ottoman and British interests. After considerable negotiation, and particularly after Mr. Slaughter had been consulted by Mr. Lynch and seen the Foreign Office, Mr. Slaughter was told by the Foreign Office on the 11th July that Mr. Lynch must either remain where he was or negotiate with Lord Inchcape on the basis of Sir Edward Grey’s proposals of the 19th May. Mr. Lynch expressed his willingness to do so, provided that participation in the local ’•management of the Ottoman Company and representation on the board were not ruled out of discussion. However, about this time Lord Inchcape left for Scotland. Accordingly, Mr. Lynch put forward his proposals of the 13th August (copy herewith), which were shown to Sir Edward Grey by Lord Ronaldshay on the 12th August. Those proposals may shortly be summarised as follows:— 1. The creation of a separate firm for the “management”* of the undertakings of the Ottoman and British Companies, in which Lord Inchcape and Mr. Lynch would be equal partners. 2. Mr. Lynch to accept such proportion of the share capital of the Ottoman Company as would leave the control of the Ottoman Company with Lord Inchcape. No reference is made to the Belgian Company, and the proposals were expressly stated to be based upon the Germans having abandoned any claim to participate in the navigation. On the 2nd September, 1913, the Foreign Office notified Mr. Slaughter that the Lynch proposals of the 13th August had been submitted to Lord Inchcape by Sir Edward Grey, and that Lord Inchcape had replied that, “subject to some qualifica tions which he would like personally to discuss with Mr. Lynch, he (Lord Inchcape) accepted Mr. Lynch’s memorandum of the 13th August ‘as a basis for the fusion of our respective interests in the management of the two concerns,’ ” and had suggested that he (Lord Inchcape) should instruct his lawyers to prepare a memorandum for joint discussion. Not only does Lord Inchcape, in his acceptance of Mr. Lynch’s proposals of the 13th August, not say one word about the Belgian Company, but he expressly refers to “ the two concerns,” viz., the Ottoman and British Companies. The matter of the Belgian Company was mentioned at the interview which took place at the Foreign Office on the 8th September, when Mr. Slaughter- met Lord Inchcape, who had unexpectedly come up from Scotland on private business, Mr. Alwyn Parker, and Lord Inchcape’s solicitor. Mr. Slaughter was careful on that occasion to point out that Mr. Lynch’s proposals said nothing about the Belgian Company, and also that Lord Inchcape’s acceptance of the principle of Mr. Lynch’s proposals of the 13th August not only did not say any thing at all about the Belgian Company, but expressly referred to “ the management of the two concerns,” namely, the Ottoman Company and the British Company, and that he (Mr. Slaughter) had no authority to bind Mr. Lynch in connection with the suggestion of including the Belgian Company. ‘ It was then agreed that the memorandum Lord Inchcape had suggested his solicitors should prepare should be drawn up. At a meeting which, with the approval of Lord Inchcape, Mr. Slaughter had with Lord Inchcape’s solicitor on the 17 th September, the first rough draft of this memorandum was submitted to Mr. Slaughter, and there was no mention in it of the inclusion of the Belgian Company. No other draft of this memorandum has been submitted to Mr. Lynch or Mr. Slaught er. Owing to Loid Inchcape’s protracted absence in Scotland, Mr. Slaughter saw Sir Eyre Crowe at the Foreign Office on the 19th September with a view to learning something about the concession to the Ottoman Company, and although the reply was that we must learn the terms of the concession from Lord Inchcape, Sir Eyre Ciowe, in a confidential letter of the 23rd September, forwarded to Mr. Slaughter the Turkish declaration governing the concession to be granted by the lurkish Government to the -British Government. * Ihe proposals were accompanied by a separate memorandum defining 1 ‘ management. [1908 hh— 2 ] B 2It is quite understood that that was a confidential communication, and also that Mr. Lynch was in the same confidence to be informed that it was proposed to let the Germans take up one-third of the Turkish share, appoint one director on the board of the Ottoman Company, and possibly have some additional small share independently the object being to commit them to the support of the scheme. This put into definite terms what had been rumoured some time before, that, although the Germans had in the early part of the year renounced participation in the river navigation, they were now claiming it again, and were going to get it. Matters remained upon this footing until, on the 8th October, Lord Inchcape and his solicitor, Sir Harry Johnstone, met Mr. Lynch and Mr. Slaughter. Lord Inchcape’s proposal to Mr. Lynch on that occasion may be briefly summarised as follows:— 1. The management firm to be a private company and to have the management not only of the undertakings of the Ottoman and British Companies, but also of the Belgian Company. Lord Inchcape and Mr. Lynch to be equally interested in the management firm, and to be the two directors of it. 2. On the basis of the capital of the Ottoman Company being 100,000Z., 50,0001 would go to the Turks, and of the balance (to be subscribed in cash) Lord Inchcape offered to the British Company the right to subscribe in cash for 30 per cent, say 15,0001. Lord Inchcape mentioned that he would not keep the whole of the balance of 70 per cent, himself as he had to deal with “other parties.” The “other parties” were not defined, but Mr. Lynch and Mr. Slaughter assumed that they included the Germans, hut not exclusively. 3. Lord Inchcape to be elected a director of the British Company, and Mr. Lynch to be elected a director of the Ottoman Company. Such a proposal is very different from either Sir Edward Grey’s proposal of the 19th May or Mr. Lynch’s proposals of the 13th August. Taking one point alone from Sir Edward Grey’s proposal, there is no provision in Lord Inchcape’s proposal that Mr. Lynch’s company or Mr. Lynch himself should have either “ cash or fully paid-up shares in the Ottoman Company,” in addition to the shares to be subscribed in cash in that company (see clauses 1 and 4 of Sir Edward Grey’s proposal). At the outset of the negotiations it was stated by the Foreign Office that the British Company should be entitled to subscribe one-third of the British half of the cash shares in the Ottoman Company, while it subsequently transpired after the 13th August (the date of Mr. Lynch’s proposals) that 40 per cent, thereof had been in the minds of the Board of Trade. This was all previous to the admission of the Germans to any shares—British or Ottoman—and quite irrespective of any cash or fully paid share. See paragraph 4 of Sir Edward Grey’s proposal. There is also the inclusion of the Belgian Company, which is not included in Sir Edward Grey’s proposal, nor in Mr. Lynch’s proposal. Lord Inchcape, indeed, now makes it a condition of negotiating with Mr. Lynch upon the basis of Sir Edward Grey’s proposal, that Mr. Lynch should throw into the management company the management and emoluments of the Belgian Company. In other words, he imposes on Mr. Lynch, as a condition precedent to negotiation, a new and onerous term, in addition to those contained in Sir Edward Grey’s proposal. Mr. Lynch is prepared to throw in the management of the Belgian Company, but to ask him to throw in emoluments as well is to ask him personally to give up all participation which he now has in those emoluments. The position with regard to them is this : they amount roughly to 2,OOOZ. a-year, and they belong to Mr. Lynchs firm, under whose regulations he personally takes one-half, or 1,000L If they were now to be thrown into the proposed new management company, that company would take the 2,000Z., Mr. Lynch’s share of which would then only be one-half, which half would be exactly that he would have to account to his partners for, so that Mr. Lynch, in effect, by throwing the emoluments of the Belgian Company into the new management company, would personally be depriving himself of any emoluments for its management. Mr. Lynch is in accord with Sir Edward Grey and Lord Inchcape in thinking it desirable that the management of the Belgian Company should be included in the management company, but he objects to that being done at his expense unless Lord Inchcape can also throw into the management company something which willcompensate Mr. Lynch for the loss he will sustain by throwing in the Belgian Company. Mr. Lynch thinks that that could be done by some concession being made by Lord Inchcape in regard to the transhipment of downward cargo to ocean steamers; but the ^amount or the emoluments from this source would have to be ascertained, and it is to he noted that the emoluments from the Belgian Company are to continue until it is dissolved by mutual consent between the parties who created it. If Lord Inchcape will make that or a similar contribution, and concede to Mr. Lynch the right to subscribe for 49 per cent, of the British share in the capital of the Ottoman Company with equal [representation on the board, it ought to be possible to reach an agreement, which agreement will, of course, provide that the extent to which anything is to be surrendered to the Germans out of the British share of the capital of the Ottoman Company shall be contributed rateably by Lord Inchcape out of his 51 per cent., and by Mr. Lynch out of his 49 per cent. Mr. Lynch’s proposals of the 13th August were designed to enable the British Company, while conforming to the conditions laid down by Sir Edward Grey’s proposals, to expand in the future as in the past; but if the view be held that the Ottoman Company is Lord Inchcape’s own property, and that the emoluments arising therefrom, mainly out of local management, belong exclusively to him, then it would seem that the basis for negotiation no longer exists, and that Mr. Lynch’s proposals of the 13th August (accepted in principle by Lord Inchcape) are now put on one side, and with them any recognition of the position of Messrs. Lynch as pioneers in the navigation of the rivers. This memorandum is prepared to demonstrate the justice of Mr. Lynch’s conten tions with the view to Sir Edward Grey exerting his influence to secure their recognition. W. GABEL SLAUGHTER. October 30, 1913. Sir Edward Grey’s Proposals of May 19, 1913. Mr. Lynch can be informed that while it is not possible to arrange that his firm shall be the concessionnaires or the managers of the new Ottoman Company, His Majesty’s Government will use their good offices to secure that :— 1. A substantial portion of the British share of the capital of the new company shall be offered for subscription by the Euphrates and Tigris Navigation Company. 2. Mr. Lynch shall be offered a seat on the board of directors. 3. The new company will be prepared to conclude a reasonable working agreement with the Euphrates and Tigris Navigation Company. 4. In consideration of the position of Messrs. Lynch as pioneers in the navigation of the rivers, they (or the Euphrates and Tigris Navigation Company) shall receive a payment in cash or a certain number of fully paid-up shares in the new Ottoman Company, in addition to any shares subscribed under 1. The above is strictly conditional on— (1.) Satisfactory guarantees being given to His Majesty’s Government that the Euphrates and Tigris Navigation Company will remain permanently under effective British control, and (2.) A clear understanding that Messrs. Lynch and the Euphrates and Tigris Navigation Company are not to look for any support by His Majesty s^ Government to any claim on their part for more extensive rights of navigation on the rivers than those which they practically exercise at present, defined as follows : (a.) Two steamers flying the British flag shall continue to navigate the Rivers Tigris and Euphrates, and to participate in the general right of navigation of the Shatt-el-Arab. (b.) One steamer flying the British flag shall be held in reserve to replace either of the aforesaid steamers during disablement. (c.) The two steamers actually plying shall be at liberty, as heretoiore, to tow two barges each. (d.) One steamer flying the Turkish flag, but placed under the direction of Messrs. Lynch or their nominees, shall be at liberty to navigate concurrently with the two steamers specified above, and likewise to tow barges.Ir Mr. Lynch's Proposals of August 13, 1913. In order to make clear the proposal which will follow, it must be borne in mind that companies of this character are governed by a board of directors, and are locally^ managed by agents, who take commissions on the earnings of the company, supplying in return the requisite local staff, &amp;c., and giving the company the benefit of any commercial connections which they may possess. I he word management used below applies to such local agents. We contend that, in view of the lengthy negotiations which, with the full support and approval of the Foreign Office, we have undertaken during recent years for the purpose of obtaining control over the Turkish steamers, we are entitled to be now given such control with the management. I should, however, be prepared, provided always that the German Government can be persuaded to acquiesce in the creation of the monopoly which, I understand, is not to be created without their consent, to recommend to my colleagues that we should share with Lord Inchcape the management of the new Ottoman Company, and that we should also share with him, in future, the management of the British steamers. A separate organisation would he created for the management of both concerns, both in London and in the East. This organisation would take the form of a new firm, distinct from the firm of Lord Inchcape and from my firm, and Lord Inchcape and his friends, and myself and my friends would be equal partners in the new firm. Great economy would thus be ensured in the administration of the two steamship services on the Tigris, which, though they would remain distinct, would be managed by the same firm. For instance, instead of two highly-paid managers, with their European and native staffs, the one administering the new Turkish Company and the other the British Company, there would, in future, be only one such manager and staff for the two services. The same would apply to London. All the commissions for the management of both lines of steamers would be taken by the one firm, in which Lord Inchcape and his freinds would have a one-half share. Besides securing economy in administration, this proposal would go far towards protecting the interests of the British Company. The new managing firm would have at heart the interests of the British Company, since they would take all the commissions arising out of its management. If the British Company are to be restricted in the future to the use of three steamers, their only hope of sharing in the traffic, as it expands, will lie in participation in the new Ottoman Company. But it is also essential that they should have an effective voice in the new company. Equitably, they have established their claim to controlling it. If this claim is not to be satisfied, I should be prepared, as part of the proposal, to recommend that they should agree to accept such proportion of the share capital of the new company as would be compatible with the exercise of control by Lord Inchcape. Bepresentation on the board would be equal, as between Lord Inchcape and the British Company, subject to the casting vote remaining in Lord Inchcape’s hands. It is obvious that this proposal is very favourable for Lord Inchcape. He is a stranger to the navigation, obtains more than one-half of the British share in the capital of the new T Ottoman Company, and one-half of the commissions from its management. He also abtains one-half of the commissions in the management of the present British Company. He is thus endowed with a very considerable new source of income. H F. B. LYNCH.

He apologised, and asked me to convey to you personally his great regret that he had been quite unable to give his attention to the matter owing to pressure of public business. His time has been entirely taken up first with questions relating to war, and then with French, Russian, German negotiations. He gave me the most categorical assurances that he intended to carry matter through, and that his objections were not due to any outside intriguing. I used every possible argument to induce him to waive his objections, but I believe they are genuine, and that it will not be advisable to refuse discussion.

Yet I attach cardinal importance to this being done. Moreover, until T know Turkish attitude towards German participation in shares allotted to Turkey, I am impeded in my negotiations with Germany. Your Excellency should impress upon Ottoman Gc vernment that, in present condition of money market, any material alteration of the terms of the concession would render it difficult to raise capital for the navigation company, while it is further to the interest of the Ottoman Government, as shareholders, not to make conditions of concession too onerous.

(No. 553.) / {November 6, 6*4 p.m.) MY telegram No. 548 I saw the Minister of Public Works this morning, who stated that the Government objections and criticisms of some of the articles of the convention had already been telegraphed to Hakki Pasha, and were now doubtless communicated to you. A further statement on the subject had been despatched to Hakki Pasha by yesterday’s mail. While declaring that he was animated by the desire to conclude the negotiations as rapidly as possible, he wished to conclude a convention which he could defend in Parliament, and he therefore found objection to certain articles which would require amplification or recasting. The wording of article 2 was unsatisfactory, as there was no clause inflicting penalties in the case of non-execution of contract, and, further, the wording, especially with reference to obstruction caused directly or indirectly by the Government or officials, was strongly objected to. Article 10, as it stands, might seriously affect irrigation scheme. Some vrords safeguarding this should be introduced. Article 13 : Some stipulation must be introduced regarding port dues at Bagdad, in accordance with the railway rights (see article 23, Bagdad Railway Convention). Interests of Agha Jaffer and of others holding navigation permits must be safeguarded, as well as ferry services established by municipal and other bodies. Provision respecting division of dividends as well as contribution to capital had not been clearly defined, and would lead to disputes in future. might pay the company to raise the rate and pay the fine. There is, moreover, no provision for obliging the company to maintain a minimum service. Minister of Public Works had no knowledge of negotiations with Germany, which were being conducted by Djavid in Berlin. He said that Djavid had telegraphed for copies of “ various conventions, including Smyrna-Aidin Railway.” I asked him again whether he was really desirous of concluding this agreement, and he asserted strongly that he was most anxious to do so.Sir Edward Grey to Sir L. Mallet (Constantinople). (No. 521.) R. /Foreign Office, November 8, 1913, 2*40 p.m. YOUR Excellency’s telegram No. 5o3 Hakki Pasha read over to-day to Mr. Parker the telegraphic instructions which he has received. With regard to Aga Jailer, the object of the Ottoman Government, according to Hakki, is not that the rights enjoyed should be safeguarded, but that Aga Jaffer should receive compensation. This is of course a matter for the Ottoman Government and not for Lord Inchcape, and it might possibly be provided by the allocation of a small percentage of the Turkish share to Aga Jaffer, but as he is understood to be on the verge of bankruptcy his rights cannot be valuable, and as his fleet is only kept in being by subsidies from Wonckhaus, this would be, in effect, an increase of the German holding, and should therefore be closely restricted. The point is one on which 1 should be glad to receive your Excellency’s observations. As to the Bagdad Railway’s rights to build ports at Bagdad and Basra, we have never before seen article 23 of the Convention of 1903 construed as conferring on the railway company exclus ive rights to build ports in those places ; presumably there would be wharves and docks outside their control. You are, moreover, aware that negotiations are in progress for the constitution of two separate port companies to acquire the rights of the Bagdad Railway Company under article 23 of the 1903 Convention. In one, if not in both, of these companies British participation is under discussion with Germany. It had been decided to confine our participation to Basra, but if the Ottoman Government really hold that article 23 confers exclusive rights on the Bagdad Railway Company at Bagdad and Basra we must endeavour to secure participation in both ports. Hakki Pasha seems to agree with our inter pretation that the rights are not exclusive. Hakki Pasha has received no instructions with reference to German participation in the shares to be in the first instance allotted to Turkey ; it is essential that we should know Turkish Government’s views on this point without delay, as meanwhile our negotiations with Germany cannot progress. It is of course inadmissible that the German participation should come from the British shares, for reasons with which your Excellency is familiar. f 1177—152J t iCONFIDENTIAL. r 1) ^ ; Sir Edward Grey to Sir L. Mallet (Constantinople). y Foreign Office, November 8, 1913, 3‘20 p.m. (No. 522.) R. YOUR telegram No. 553 In Hakki Pasha s telegraphic instructions exception is, inter alia, taken to the continuance of the “ privileges and immunities ” of the concessionnaire after the expiration of sixty years. This amounts, in effect, to a cancellation of the concession at the end of that period, whereas the intention, clearly expressed in the declaration of 29th July, was that the concessionnaire should continue to navigate, though without any exclusive rights, if at the end of the sixty years the concession were not prolonged. The concessionnaire will, however, in practice, be unable to navigate if customs immunities and such like privileges are withdrawn at the end of the sixty years, especially if he has to purchase his fuel at a high price in Turkey in consequence of the Ottoman desire to create a petroleum monopoly. Your Excellency should point this out to the Ottoman Government, laying stress upon the fact that the declaration of 29th July is a compromise, whereby His Majesty’s Government abandon the claims to extensive rights of navigation for British vessels under the arrangement of 1846, the agreement of 1823 with Daoud Pasha, and long-established practice. If, however, not merely the exclusive rights, but the concession itself, even under competitive conditions, is, in effect, to be limited to sixty years, the compromise we agreed to will be violated in spirit and in letter. I shall be glad to receive the detailed observations of the Ottoman Government on this change of attitude on their part. You should inform the Ottoman Government that in all their criticisms on the concession they appear to overlook the fact that they themselves are shareholders.

I regret that some days should have elapsed before I have been able to reply ; but I have found it necessary, in regard to the points which you raise, to consult Mr. Parker, who, as you are aware, is on leave in the north of Scotland, and also to communicate with the Board of Trade. There has not yet been time for me to receive the observations of the latter, and I can consequently even now only reply generally to your communication. I am not free to depart from Sir E. Grey’s decision, taken after due consideration, that the communication to Mr. Lynch of the text of the concession is a matter to be left to the discretion of Lord Inchcape, and seeing that this decision was conveyed to Lord Inchcape as definite, I am afraid I could not ask Sir E. Grey to reconsider it or to put pressure on his Lordship, which would, in fact, be tantamount to withdrawing from him the discretion conceded. I feel more than ever convinced, viewing the situation as a whole, that the first step at the present juncture ought to be a meeting between Lord Inchcape and Mr. Lynch, and a full discussion between them with a view to a settlement, and I cannot but think that when such meeting and discussion have taken place, much of what Mr. Lynch now appears to apprehend as difficulties will be found to disappear.

This has been considered by Mr. Lynch and our Mr. Slaughter, and probably has already been seen by Lord Inchcape and yourselves, so that you will appreciate that, courteous as it is of the Foreign Office to have allowed us to see it, it really carried us very little further because it does not give the information it is important to know.

Dear Mr. Slaughter, Foreign Office, September 23, 1913. HAYING carefully read Mr. Lynch’s letter, of which you have been good enough to send me a copy, I think the best way to assist Mr. Lynch in his difficulty would he to let him see the Turkish declaration which governs the concession granted by the Turkish Government to Lord Inchcape. I therefore forward a copy of that declaration herewith ; hut I trust you will not think me unreasonable in asking from Mr. Lynch, in return, for a written acknowledgment and undertaking that he will treat this document as strictly confidential. You might inform him at the same time, and in the same confidence, that it is proposed to let the Germans take up one-third of the Turkish share and one director, and possibly some additional small share inde pendently, the object being to commit them to the support of the_scheme. I trust this will facilitate Mr. Lynch’s consideration of the conditions on which he should come to an understanding with Lord Inchcape. As regards the relative position of Mr. Lynch and Lord Inchcape in respect to the concession, the difference, of course, is that the concession is one granted to Lord Inchcape and not one granted to Mr. Lynch ; and it does not seem to me really a question open to argument that it is not for the Foreign Office to communicate to Mr. Lynch or any other third parties a contract which has passed between the Turkish Government and Lord Inchcape. I trust Mr. Lynch will find that all real difficulties will be seen to disappear when his and Lord Inchcape’s representatives come together for the purpose of arranging a settlement which, I understand, both parties are now desirous to effect. Pending such an arrangement, I do not think that the Foreign Office can usefully intervene any further. I am, &amp;c. EYRE A. CROWE. i Enclosure in No. 1. Declaration. 1.

Yours truly, W. CAPEL SLAUGHTER. Enclosure in No. 1. Mr. Lynch to Mr. Slaughter Dear Mr. Slaughter, 33, Pont Street, London, September 22, 1913. I HAVE duly received your letter of the 19th instant, reporting to me the tenor of what passed during your recent interviews at the Foreign Office, and with Lord Inchcape’s lawyers. Beyond obtaining the general approval on the part of the 1 oreign Office of my proposal of the 13th August, which was signified to us some w 7 eeks ago, we do not appear to have made any progress ; although 1 have remained in London myself, with only a few days’ absence on two occasions, during all the holiday time, in the endeavour to ascertain whether we can come to a satisfactory solution of matters which are vital to the future of our business. You will remember that Lord Jnchcape expressed general approval ot my proposals of the 13th August, but intimated that he w r as getting out a memoiandum on the subject. . . A considerable time has elapsed since that intimation, ana j am stilt not m possession of the memorandum. I think I am entitled to ask that some arrangements may be made tor prompt communication between myself and Lord Inchcape. Then there is the Convention which forms the subject of the negotiations. I scarcely know whether there are tw r o conventions, one constituting the propose new Ottoman Company, and accompanied by statutes and c&lt; cahier ties charges, t e other a general convention between Great Britain and Turkey, oi e.iet ler t e two are merged in a single convention. It does not, of course, matter, but a uesne o pom out that I am quite in the dark as regards the subject matter of the negotia ions wi i Lord Inchcape until I have seen the provisions constituting the new company and also those subsidiary provisions relating to such matters as die a P^ ( e P 0 ® waterways, the facilities to be given to water-borne traffic over the lanw a^o 0 ^, 0110 Bagdad, and other such matters strictly cognate to the navigation oi me upnacs To enable me to negotiate with Lord Inchcape I am bound to ask that these portions of the draft convention between Great Britain ami iui voy may K to me.- • I notice that you were informed at the Foreign Office that the Convention fit .8 not clear whether such convention comprises the whole or only a poit.on ot th matters referred to above) has been given to Lord Incncape on the understanding that it was in Lord Inchcape’s hands to communicate the contents to me when ho thought fit. jerocw* * V “ [1863 2—2] / A. \ Copy to Jridia 17 OCT 1913 ipI notice that you have written to Lord Inchcape s solicitors asking them tu communicate the terms of the Convention ; but 1 must not be construed as acquiescing in the strict correctness of such application. In other words, I must not be taken as admitting that we are on a different footing to Lord Inchcape in respect of these negotiations in our relations with the Foreign Office. # I need not remind you of the past history of the negotiations, or of the fact that any convention dealing with this subject must be largely based upon my own work and that of my colleagues. With all respect to the Foreign Office, I do submit that I have a just claim to be shown the Convention by them. I will also ask that I may be given free access to the Foreign Office as regards these matters, just as Lord Inchcape is given free access. I understood that this was promised by Sir Edward Grey to Lord Ronaldshay before the session came to a close, but for one reason or another the necessary facilities have not yet been extended. I may add that it is my sincere desire to arrive at a settlement, and it is in this spirit that I have entered into these further negotiations. Yours truly, H. F. B.

I &amp; i 3 [45926] ^ 1- Lord Inchcape to Sir E. Crowe.—(Received October 9.) My dear Sir Eyre, 9, Throgmorton Avenue, London, October 8, 1913. I HAD a meeting to-day with Mr. Lynch and Mr. Slaughter, at which my solicitor, Sir Henry Johnson, was present. Mr. Lynch was anxious to see the concession, but I told him I would be quite prepared to answer any questions he had to make in regard to it, but I would rather not show it to him until we had comedo an agreement'in regard to the management firm. Mr. Lynch made various enquiries about the concession, and seemed to be satisfied that it was a good thing, but he was particular on one point, and that was as to whether the Turkish Government were to get any royalty on the earnings of the Navigation Company independent tll J eir dividend on the shares. I told him there was no provision for this, and he said that he thought the Turkish Parliament would insist upon payment of a royalty, and that if we succeeded in getting the concession ratified without a stipulation of this kind we should be extremely lucky. It passed through my mind that Mr. Lynch might endeavour through his myrmidons in Constantinople to try and block the concession on this point, and after the interview Sir Henry Johnson told me the same thing had occurred to him. . • . f Mr. Lynch asked if the concession provided for compensation m event ot tne water being taken away for irrigation purposes and navigation being made impossible. I said it did not ; but that if the Turks by their action spoilt the river we should undoubtedly have a claim for damages, and that question must be left to the tuture. He further raised some rather irrelevant questions as to the Bagdad Railway Concession being altered to protect the Navigation Company against higher rates being charged on the railway for river-borne than for rail-borne traffic, but I said it was impossible for us to get the Bagdad Railway Concession altered. He also raised the point of the German farticipatffin in the Navigation Company, but I told him nothing had been settled in regard to that, and it was a matter for the Foreign Office. ^ . In regard to the management company, I said that it was a sine qua non that this company should have the management of the Societe des Transports fluviaux as we as the Euphrates and Tigris and the new Turkish company. Mr Lynch jibbed at this desiring to keep it outside the management company, but I told him emphatically that that wpuld be impossible. He said that this was altogether a new idea, but Mr Slaughter came to the rescue here, and pointed out to Mr. Lynch that he had mentioned the matter to him as having been put forward at meeting at the I omgn Office on the 9th September. I had m view the postscript to Mr. Parker s letter io ML Slaughter of the 2nd September, 1913, but I did not quote the letter, as I was not sure whether it had been communicated by Mr. Slaughter to Mi. Lynch. . . . One rather important point came out. When I told Mr. Lynch I must participate j in the Societe des Eaux fluviales management he said it was not worth troubling about as that company merely had the conveyance of railway material upwaids and rrv no thina down. This is scarcely in accord with his previous assertion, ?ha it was always Understood that this Belgian company was to be permitted to carry ci?™ down as Well as railway material up. He evidently means to drop tins claim now or at any rate, he puts forward the disability regarding downward cargo with a view of keeping the management of the Belgian company to himse :. T tinnlated that as Mr Lynch was to have a seat on the board of the new lurkish I Stipulated ‘ y f t0 lla ve a se at on the board of the Euphrates company it would ^ ““^fmpLy, and to this he made no demur. I further and bPn tlfat fn the new management company I should have the controlling voice stipulated that m tl f but I think the difficulty may be overcome, and I rather 3 gathered tha^H we 'stand firm enough he will agree to bring the Fluviaux comj^any^under the management s a si s o ° n) but : told him that I was not prepared He pressea very come to an agreement m regard to the management company,‘ami if after we had made that agreement, he thought the concession was [1908 *—3]not good enough for him to have anything to do with, he would he at liberty to withdraw from the proposed management company. ' 0 I gave him to understand that, so far as I was personally concerned, it would suit me better to have the management of the new Turkish company in my own hands as it had potentialities for development which the Euphrates and Tigris company had not, but that I was quite willing to throw my lot in with him and to work with him m a friendly and amicable way. m He spoke of his interest in the new Turkish company, and I said that I proposed to let him have 30 per cent, of the holding which falls to me, and I rather think with this he will be satisfied. He is to think my proposals over and to communicate with me in a few days I hope in the meantime Hakki will ratify the concession, as I am sure Lynch would still wreck it if he could.

Mr. Parker to Mr. Slaughter. Dear Mr. Slaughter, Foreign Office, September 2, 1913. I HAVE to-day received a letter from Lord Inchcape respecting the proposal dated the 13th August and made by Mr. Lynch. On the receipt of this proposal, Sir E. Grey caused a letter to be written to the Board of Trade asking for the observations of that Department, and his letter concluded with the following paragraph :— “ Sir E. Grey considers that it would be difficult for His Majesty’s Government to express a decided opinion on the merits of the present proposal; but he is disposed to let Lord Inchcape know that they would favour a settlement if Mr. Lynch is reasonable in regard to any modifications which may appear equitable.” A copy of the minute handed by me to Colonel Picot on the 19th August was also furnished to the Board of Trade. The Board of Trade considered that the proposal of Mr. Lynch marked a distinct change, and offered at least the possibility of an acceptable arrangement. The Board of Trade considered, however, that, as regards the details .of the proposal, Mr. Lynch’s claim to participate in the new Ottoman Company to the extent of one-half almost was excessive, and that Lord Inchcape was not likely to be prepared to concede more than one-third, or at most 40 per cent, (of the British share), and they did not think he could reasonably be asked to do so. The Board saw no objection in principle to the scheme for the formation of a separate company to manage the new Ottoman Company and the Euphrates and Tigris Company, and in which the shares should be held by the two undertakings in equal proportions. . Further details of the scheme would, it was pointed out, require careful consideration. These views were placed before Lord Inchcape iu a letter written by Sir E. Grey’s direction ; and Lord Inchcape has replied in a very conciliatory letter, which I have placed before Sir E. Grey this morning. The letter contains the following passages:— “ I have given the proposal careful consideration and, in deference to Sir Edward Grey’s wishes, I am prepared to accept it as a basis for the fusion of our respective interests in the management of the two concerns, subject of course to our being able to come to an agreement as to details, and in regard to one or two points which I will mention to Mr. Lynch. One of them, for instance, is that I think it is essential that 1 should have a seat on the Board of the Euphrates and Tigris Company. “ As Mr. Lynch and I will now be entering upon friendly negotiations, which, if they materialise, will make our interests hereafter identical, I shall refrain from commenting on his memorandum, but I think I may permit myself to say that 1 cannot accept the &amp; conclusion in the first sentence of the last paragraph of his memorandum of the 13th August, that his proposal is obviously very favourable to me. « jf agreeable to Mr. Lynch, I shall ask my solicitors to draw up a brief memorandum providing 'for the fusion of management, embodying such conditions as I think may be necessary, and this I will submit to Mr. Lynch as soon as possible, and we can then meet and discuss it. , „ u Perhaps yon will lot me know whether I am to pioceecl as proposeu. I quote this letter on the distinct understanding that it does not contain Lord Inchcape’s formal proposals, or is to be regarded as binding upon him : it is a private letter to this Office, and is written without prejudice to his actual proposals which will be embodied in the memorandum by his solicitors. Sir E. Grey instructed me to bring the letter to your notice, and uo say that riis Maiesty’s Government are in favour of negotiations taking place for jomu management , they feel, however, that it is essential that the strictest con fidence shou ld be maintained with regard to them. , : ;CrK / [1863 . seen 0 &lt;s ^ ■ i 1 AVf Copy to 3 OCT 1913 CilSir E. Grey has come to this decision after having been informed of the purport of Mr. Lynch’s letter to Said Ruete ; and he feels confident that^ Mr. Lynch will use his best endeavours to reach a conciliatory conclusion, and one which will be in the interests of British trade in general. Sir E. Grey also asked me to say that he feels the greater confidence in the successf of the arrangement contemplated because of your personal association with the‘ negotiations. Do you think that, in view of Lord Inchcape’s letter, it would be possible to get him to write a friendly letter to Lord Inch cape ? Believe me, &amp;c. ALWYN PARKER. P.S.—I am to add that Sir E. Grey considers that the management company should, if possible, have the management and emoluments consequent thereon, of the “ Societe des Transports Fluviaux ” (which is the company entrusted with the conveyance of the material for the Bagdad Railway) and that Lord Inchcape should participate equally with Mr. Lynch in those emoluments : but it seems expedient to reserve any negotiations between Mr. Lynch and the Germans till a little later. As soon as I hear from you that such a proposal would be agreeable to Mr. Lynch, I will write to Lord Inchcape as suggested by him in the concluding paragraph of his letter. A. P.6 [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] ASIATIC TURKEY AND ARABIA. [September 15.] CONFIDENTIAL. Section 6 . [40688] No. 1. Foreign Office to Lord Inchcape. (Confidential.) My Lord, Foreign Office, September 15, 1913. I AM directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to transmit herewith to your Lordship copy of a letter addressed to this Department by the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Steam Navigation Company, requesting that an exception from the monopoly to be conferred upon the new Ottoman Navigation Company should be made in favour of the downward carriage of general cargo by the steamers of the Railway Transport Company. No reply has yet been returned to this communication, and it is not proposed to do so until further progress has been made with the settlement of the relations between the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company and your Lordship’s proposed new company. Sir E. Grey considers, however, that there is some force in the request, and that it will be somewhat difficult to refuse it altogether, unless of course a satisfactory working agreement be arrived at between the new company and the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, which will make it unnecessary to deal with the question now raised. In this connection I am to state that Colonel Picot informed Mr. Parker some time ago that the point of the communication in question would probably disappear if an arrangement for joint management of the whole river traffic, including transport of the Bagdad Railway material, was concluded between Mr. Lynch and your Lordship. I am to add that, as Sir E. Grey is extremely reluctant to give any facilities to a company largely representative of German interests to engage in the general cargo trade on the Tigris, he is the more desirous that a speedy settlement should, if possible, be arrived at between the new company and the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company of a nature which would enable him to return a negative reply to the present application. I am to mention, for your Lordship’s confidential information, that the Board of Trade are of opinion that, whatever be the result of the proposals for a settlement between the two companies now under consideration, no countenance should be given to the present request of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, at all events without very strict limitations as regards period, number of vessels, and rates of freight. I am, &amp;c. EYRE A. CROWE. [1863 p—6] Copy to fndla 2o SEP 1913[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Government.] ^ ASIATIC TURKEY AND ARABIA, [September 15.] CONFIDENTIAL. Section 3. [38451] No. 1. Foreign Office to Messrs. Slaughter and May. (Confidential.) _ ^ ^ Gentlemen, Foreign Office, September 15, 1913. SECRETAEY Sir E. Grey understands that you are already aware that Colonel Picot, acting on behalf of your client, Mr. H. F. B. Lynch, recently communicated to this Department certain documents, of which, for facility of reference, a printed copy is enclosed.* These documents have reference to, and contain a detaded commentary upon, answers returned by the Secretary of State on the 32nd duly to questions addressed to him in Parliament by the Earl of Ronaldshay, on the subject of the navigation of the Rivers Euphrates and Tigris. i • , j t • Sir E. Grey observes that Colonel Picot explicitly disclaims any desire to deal in a contentious spirit with the points raised; having regard to this statement, and to the fact that negotiations, which seem not unlikely to result in an acceptable settlement, are now pending between your client and the concessionnaire of the new Ottoman company Sir E. Grey does not propose that a detailed reply should be sent to Colonel Picot, the more so as such a reply would be controversial; it would have reference to past misunderstandings rather than to a future settlement, and it would therefore serve I I am however, directed to inform you that this reticence should not be interpreted as acauiescence in the statements of fact contained in the documents referred to; there is on the contrary, marked and frequent discrepancy between those statements and the official records of this Department, and the Secretary of State cannot admit that he was “ misinformed ” in drawing up his answers to Lord Ronaldshay. While Sir E. Grey considers it necessary to make this written reservation to you now, he desires to leave it to your discretion whether this letter should be communicated to your client at once or at a latei date. jl am, &lt;vc.

Board of Trade to Foreign Office—(Received September 3.) ^Confidential) Board of Trade, September 2, 1913, I AM directed by the Board of Trade to acknowledge the receipt of your letters of the 16th and 23rd August relative to a request from the Euphrates and ligris Steam Navigation Company that an exception from the monopoly to be conferred upon the new Ottoman Navigation Company should be made m favour of the downward carriage of general cargo by the steamers of the Railway Transport Company. In replv, I am to suggest that no definite reply should be returned to the request until further progress has been made with the settlement of the relations between the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company and Lord Inchcape s new company. The company might, however, be asked to state whether they had applied to the Turkish Government for permission for the Railway Transport steamers to be freighted with general cargo on their downward voyages, and, if so with what result. In the meantime, the Board would suggest that a copy of the letter from the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company might be sent confidentially to Lord Inchcape, with the observations that no reply has yet been returned to it, Lit that Sir E. Grey considers that there is some force m the request, and that it will be somewhat difficult to refuse it altogether, unless, of course, a satisfactory working agreement be arrived at between the new company and the Euphrates and fig is Steam Navigation Company, which will make it unnecessary to deal with the question now raised It might be added that, as Sir E.
