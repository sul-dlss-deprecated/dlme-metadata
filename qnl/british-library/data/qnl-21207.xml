From To H. Weightman, Fsquire, I.C.3., Political Agent, Bahrain. His fc-ajecty^ Ambassador, British Embassy, Baghdad. Sir, I have the honour to address you (with the permission of the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf) on the following subject. His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain * and his Government are anxious to improve and exprnd the educational system of the Bahrain State, and they enquire whether the Embassy at Baghdad would be kind enough to approach the Iraq Government on their behalf for the loan of the services of one of their educational experts for the purpose of visiting Bahrain, of examining the educational organisation at present existing and of advising on its future growth. They believe that a period of one month — or possibly six weeks — would be ample for the purpose in view, and the Bahrain Government would of course meet the expenses of deputation (in regard to which they would be grateful for information in advance) and of travel. The name of Tf! r. C.H.L. Adrian Vallence has been suggested in this connection and His Highness the Shaikh would be greatly beholden if the Iraq Government would be so good as to permit this gentleman to visit Bahrain (if he himself is agreeable/-© • ► 2 - t agreeable) for the brief period and for the purpose stated. 2.

Letter No. C/134 dated the 26th February 1939 to His Majesty' i Educational Expert for the Ambassador, British Embassy, / Baghdad, from the Political Agent, Bahrain. Bahrain State.L t , Sir, British iilmhassy, Bagdad. 13th March, 1939. [tTI &amp; / I am airected to offer the following observations on your despatch No. C/134-1.b/S of February 26th. 2. The Ambassador foresees that if they are approached in the manner desired by the Shaikh and the Government of Bahrain the Iraqi Government will readily agree to send an official of the Ministry of Education to advise on the development of education in Bahrain. It seems certain, however, that they would not choose one of their British teachers for this task. As you know there are many in this country who wish to spread the influence of Iraq among the Sheikhdoms of the Persian Gulf and, given the opportunity suggested, the authorities concerned would without doubt prefer to send an Iraqi official who, though he might well give general advice of value, would probably endeavour to bring the schools f of Bahrain under Iraqi influence. 3. It may be that the Shaikh himself wishes that his schools and their curriculum should conform to the systems followed in Iraq in order that the students may be able to continue their education in one or other of the colleges now established in Iraq, such as the Medical College, the Engineering College, the Military College or the Law College, and in that event he might welcome a visit from an Iraqi official. On the other hand, in /view The Political Agent, BAHRAIN.view of the attitude towards the Arab States of the Persian Gulf recently taken up in influential circles in this country, the shaikh and his advisers may think it undesirable at present to further the strengthening of Iraqi influence in Bahrain. In the Ambassador’s view this risk ought at the moment to be the predominant consideration and in itself renders the proposal in present circumstances highly inadvisable; but in any case the Ambassador suggests that, before he approaches the Iraqi Government in the manner proposed, the Shaikh should be asked whether he would object to an Iraqi official being sent to advise his government about education. 4. If, as a result of this enquiry, it is shown that the Shaikh wishes that one of the British teachers here rather than an Iraqi official should be deputed to give his government the desired help, the Ambassador suggests that he should be authorised on the Shaikh’s behalf to arrange for Mr. C.R. Adrian Vallance or another suitable British teacher from Iraq to visit Bahrain privately during the summer vacation. This could be arranged directly with the teacher concerned without reference to the Iraqi Government. 5. The Ambassador is sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and to the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I am, Sir obedient Servant Yourgonfidential i &amp; Ex D,O.No* 246-5« The Residency, Buahire, the 24th March, 1939 d&gt; Gould you pieas^ refer to the enclosure to your Printed Letter No.c/135-1 #b/6, dated the 26th February 1939, on the subject of an educational expert for the Bahrain State. 2. In my Express Letter No. 667-13, dated the 2nd December 1938, I expressed some doubt as t o the advisability of procuring an educational expert from Iraq: i.e. an Iraqi. (An Englishman, such as suggested in your letter to the Embassy, Bagdad, is of course another matter.) In paragraph 5 of your Express Letter No.C/751-1.b/5, dated the 8th December 1938, both you and a^e were of the opinion that there would be no danger of hostile press propaganda from Iraq as a result of the visit of an Iraqi official. Are you both still of the same opinion after the recent Iraqi broadcast outburst against Bahrain (vide correspondence ending with my Printed Letter N 0 . i74-£, dated the 13th March 1939)?

I am unable to ascertain here exactly when the summer vacation in the Iraq schools begins and ends. It would be desirable, if it I were possible, for Mr. Vallance or another British teacher from Iraq to see the Bahrain schools in session in order that he may form some opinion of the adequacy or inadequacy of local teaching efforts.

It aims at stopping the anti-British propaganda vvhi is Ling spread through the Gulf hy young Arabs who ere being educate' in Syria and Iraq and by Syrian and Iraqi teachers ^providing scan British education which would have great political value ir future. 1 believe that something on these lines was succeosfully carried out in Aden some yeere ago. o t r&gt;m in entire greement with Vallance s opinioii that young men educated in Iraq and Syria beepme an y- ; ^^ s ^ 1°™ home. With very few exceptions this has happened m the case Bahrhnyoulhs educated at Beyrout or in Iraq. According to Vallance foreign students in Iraq are deliberately fed on anti-3riuish nvnnafranda• he is in a position to know i H this is uhe case, i ve - often'heard Beyrout University described as a hotbed of nationalism ^and anti- IngUsh propaganda, 1 heard this from a cousin of ^ne who worked there for a year and. from other people as well, gg these r-olitical views ore not supported or encouraged by the University authorities^ We have had, in the past, the same trouble in Bahrain with Syrian teachers who incited our own sch&amp;fcl boys against their Government but nothing of this kind happened during t1 ^ r ®®^ e E ^ ti h the late school Inspector who in spite of faults was not anti-^ri - and had the teachers under very tight control. it is luestiona^ in the case of Bahrain whether fewer boys are going to India. L ( ,t.. quite a number of boys have been sent by their parents to Indian schools hut 1 am not yet in a position to say what the result Oa experiment has been. Parents sending son^ abroad invariably complai i to me about the lack of advanced educational facilities m hr,.i . Xf the scheme which Vallance outlines came into being and if young men from neighbouring states came here it would be^of great Political value to the British Government but the cost ana the resnonsibi ity would lie heavily on Bahrain. If the scheme was a success, and 1 think it would be, it would add to the impoj*tance ana prestige of Bahrain, i should like to see Bahrain both the medical and educational centre of the Persian Gulf. /. There is a real desire in Bahrain for more advanced education than anything which the Government now provides, if this was available 1 believe people wo\ Id pay for it. They want education, as Vallance says, not for its own sake but because they believe it will enable them' to earn more money. It is the townspeople who are asking for it and also, now a days, some of the young Shaikhs who have begun to be ashamed of being less well educated than shop keepers sons. The townspeople need to earn money, the young shaikhs do not, but 1 am sure that some of the Shaikhs would willingly pay for their sons being educated here. 5. If the institution which Vallance describes came into^ extistence there is certainly no better place for it than Bahrain. The political value of the scheme depends much on the support which it might obtain from neighbouring states, especially, in my opinion, Saudi Arabia. Ibn Saud when he was here spoke of the danger of sending boys to be educated in Iraq but 1 think he would have no objection to sending them to Bahrain. It is very difficult however to estimate how many foreign boys would come liere, urtil the college had been running for some time I dont suppose many would come. 6. Apart from financial and practical questions the most important qHXxiismxix point to be ponsidered is the number of trained men who can be absorbed into jobs in Bahrain. There is now such a shortage of educated young men that the Government itself has to. 2 . &gt;(r employ ^forei^ners , Indians and Syrians, in many positions which could be filled by local Arabs if they v/ere sufficiently well educated. In the schools all senior teachers are foreigners and there are non technical posts in P.W.D., Electric department and Medical Dept v/hich could be filled by local men though in some of these cases the men v/ould need a special course after Completing education here, for example surveyors and draftsmen. The same condition exists in the Bapco and to a lesser extent in the case of other commercial firms. It is difficult to give a precise estimate of the number of men who would find employment but I think that for several years to come about half a dozen educated young men will be needed in Government departments alone for clerical work. I think it could be assumed that the Bapco and other firms v/ould absorb another half dozen men every year. 7. The initial cost of building a college and equipx^ing it v/ould be heavy. Vallance advocates a boarding school out in the country, this would cost more and I do not think it is a very practicable suggestion. I would suggest that the college should be near enough to Manama, or Muharraq, for the boys to work at the Technical School, which in any case is to be enlarged this year. A building to accomodate 100 boys, allowing for future development, with a hostel for 60 boys, and quarters for teaching staff could I think be built and equipped for, say £16,000, Rs 1,30,000, provided that it was not built on reclaimed land which increases the cost of building considerably as in the case of the Law Courts, Hospital and Customs House. Local boys would be day shholars and foreign students v/ould live in the hostel. 8. It is difficult to estimate the running cost of the college. On the basis of 40 students with one English headmaster and four Asiatic teachers with twenty boarding boys and twenty day boys I calculate roughly that the cost per annum v/ould be about &amp;xx2&amp;&amp;&amp; Rs 30,000. If the students paid at the rate of Rs 30/- P.ft. for day boys and Rs 50/- P.I, . for boarders the income would be about Rs 14,000 per school year. The Government would have to find not less than Rs I6$ooo annually in addition to the amount now spent on education. It would be possible however to do v/ithout an Inspector of Education if the Principal of the college was an Englishman.raft An efficient Syrian School Inspector costs not less than Rs 4200 per annum. In addition to this the Government would stop sending boys to Beyrout for education v/hich costs now about Rs 1000 for a school year. Th re are two young Shaikhs now at Beyrout. 8. The scheme on the whole apxEX±xx±E appears to me to have great possibilities kjaih it would be useful for Bahrain and I believe valuable politically. The Bahrain Government would satisfy the public demand for higher education and v/ould ensure a supply of educated men uncontaminated by foreign influence and there would no longer be the need to send young men to Berout, which is expensive, or to Iraq and India. Prom the wider political point of view the presence of students from other states is essential, I believe they v/ould come. I see no reason why the states concerned should not be sounded on the subject. I believe the scheme has great political value, such value that in order to facilitate its political object Bahrain might reasonably expect financial help from outside to carry it through. If substantial assistance was forthcoming I should be strongly in favour of carrying it out but without this assistance I think the burden which v/ould be placed on Bahrain is too heavy. I think that if half the initial cost of scheme could be paid by the British Government the other half v/ould readily be born by Bahrain and if a moderate grant for the annual expenditure could be found from outside the remainder could be be met by the Bahrain Government.D.C .ro .C/443- The 22nd .T'Jlj' 1039, I t&gt;nscXoF&gt;e herewith a copj' of o. letter written by /3ri*n**Va3.1©jnce to on the sobject of i; Gcheino to provide, higher edneotion in Behrsin for the Arnb States of % the ^ulf* Vy 2« J was unfortunately ew«r; on the True 1*1 noant at the tlro&lt;d of V^llanee’ s all too brief visit to Bahrain and so have had no opportunity of discus sin,:- his ideas xi th him* due, I have had talks *.vith Belgrsve (henco the delay in sendinf this on to you) | and the vis^s expx*eased in Bel^ranre 1 a letter of the 20th July, of 7/hich X al»o one lose a copy repreaent uome of the conclusions to which w* ourselves have cone. Theie are, of course, aspects of this ouastion on v/hich it is more convenient for me to coiwnsnt than fo * him. 3* Taking a broad view, a schema for a 3i*itlsh- inspired college providing higher education in Bahrain for the /reb states of the Gulf, and open to dftudi ^r?»Mo, the Hadramaut and possibly even as for aa the Veoi.^n e/tormoiisly attract ive* /.nd no one could seriously contest Vsll^ance's expoaitJon of the dUngera involved in a policy of laissez- faire. T do not rrenose to labour these points — for they are self-evident — but to concentrate on certain practical aspects of the oro.lert. 4* Since the proposal la to locate the College at Bahrain f tho first Question must relate to Bahrain* a needs and capacity for absorption of finished student 3 $ for it is above all/ The Honourable Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Trenchard Fowls, rciB., CBE., Political Resident in the Persian ^ulf, Bushire.6 ./ all things essential that higher education In these parts should be strictly utilitarian, and we must avoid like the plague the creation of an unemployable Intelligentsia• I agree with Belgrave that It would be unsafe to anticipate that Bahrain could provide permanent employment — in Government Institutions and In commercial firms — for more than a dozen educated young men annually* This as a steady average* Assuming that the College course will last three years this means an enrolment of 36 Bahrain boys at any one time (taking,of course, three years to work up to this figure)* And probably this figure represents fairly closely the number of parents who — at any one time — could afford and would want to pay, say Rs*30/- permensem for higher education for their children* Add two or three young men of Shalkhly families and we get a mamlmum figure of 40* These would all be day-students* Bahrain parents would demand this and there are many reasons — building costs, water, lighting, proximity to the technical school and so on — why the College should be built within close range of Manama* 5* It is more difficult to estimate the number of boys who might come from other Gulf States* From Vallance's post-script it appears that Kuwait has about 26 boys being educated now in Iraq and Syria} and Kuwait might therefore send 20 in future to Bahrain* Muscat and the Traclal Coast might produce 10 between them* Of Saudi Arabia I feel quite hopeful, and I do not think it would be unreasonably optimist ic to expect that in the third year from its foundation the Bahrain College would be approaching a total enrolment of 60 foreign boys* For their future employment Bahrain would of course accept no responsibility, but for their training as decent citizens a very heavy r esponsibility would devolve on Bahrain*6. Now it seems evident enough that if the Vallance scheme Is to be a success we must most definitely avoid a w bits and pieces” construction. Without considerable foreign enrolment, a College in Bahrein would be an absurdity, or at least a top- heavy and rather perilous affair. At the sare time, if we are to expect Rulers of other States to send boys to the Bahrain College for education, we must be in a position to send out a really attractive 'prospectus' right from the start — with photographs of impressive buildings and details of an impressive teaching staff. I am convinced in my own mind that none of these Rulers will send their youths to a half-fledged College being built — both materially and scholastically — above the boys* heads. While, therefore, it would be reasonable to enquire at this stage from other States whether they would support a .College in Bahrain, it would be essential to take encouraging replies at their face value, to build at once for the expected total enrolment, and not to attempt any half-hearted policy involving adjustment of the pace of construction to the pace of recruitment. 7. As you will see from Belgrave* s letter we think that a College building for 100 students, a hostel, teacher*s houses, playing grounds etcetera might be constructed for about £ 10,000. I do not feel altogether easy about this estimate, but it will serve as a preliminary figure. Recurring costs will include the pay of an Snglish Headmaster, ar^( English Hostel Manager (an essential, in my opinion) and four Asiatic teachers, an allotment at 5 % of capital cost fcr the maintenance of buildings, and a considerable sum for contingencies. (Hostel commisariat charges will of course be covered by boarding fees end need not be taken into account here). At a rough estimate I should put annual charges at about Rs.60,000/- to Rs.66,000/- when the total enrolment of 100 is reachedf and income will — at a/ - 3 - \ V rba school fee of Rs.270/- per school-year for Bahrainis and Rs.315/- for foreigners — amount to Rs.30,000/- odd. I doubt if higher fees could be charged, for obviously the conw bined school and hostel charges to foreign boys must be competitive. In the first 2 or 3 years while the College is working up to its full enrolment, receipts from fees will of course be considerably less, while charges for salaries to school-staff and for maintenance of buildings would also be smaller — though not proportionately so. I should estimate the net deficit in the beginning at Rs.27,000/-, possibly declining later to Rs.20,000/-. And this makes no allowance for loss of interest on capital expenditure. In the light of these figures I think I should repeat my firm conviction that unless the College makes an impressive start, on however uneconomical a basis, there can be little hope of achieving its ultimate objective. 8. How, the^ can such a project be financed ? Bahrain is admittedly wealthy in these days but in a comparative sense only, and we must not forget (a) that it has to support an expensive ruling family who take one third of its income (plus bits) and (b) that we want the Bahrain Government to save Rs.15 lakhs — or another third — for many years to come in order to build up an adequate Reserve Fund. In effect, therefore, one must divide the Bahrain income by 3 when considering her resources for New Projects. That third is ample for current administration, for many much-needed improve ments, even for commercial or economic development (on which, as you know, I have large views), but it is not sufficient to finance in to to any scheme from which Bahrain would not derive the sole and entire benefit. And Vallance*s scheme, while of immense benefit (under firm control) to Bahrain, has far wider objects — advantages for the British Empire and advantages for other Arab States. Politically I feel it is impossible to advocate such a scheme unless we can tell the Shaikh and his family/Family Advisers that we are willing to contribute or to guarantee contributions towards initial and recurring costs equivalent roughly to the value of the beneiits wh^ch his Majesty's Government and its other clients or friends might derive from the Vallance scheme# (I hope this is not obscure — I am trying to be brief)• 9# I submity thereforey the definite proposal th?- His Majesty's Government should be invited to contribute £5y000/- to t&amp;e initial cost of buildingf and that the British Council be approached to provide at the Council's expense an tnglish Headmaster* I feel it should not be difficult to convince His Majesty's Government that £5y00Q/«“ is a small price to pay for the advantages they might expect to gain from the establishment of such a College in Bahrain, and the project appears to be one pre-eminently deserving the support and aid of the British Council* 10. Vallance has declared that the Bahrain Oil Company ought to be invited to subscribe# Personally I am not very greatly in favour of asking them for a cash subscriptionj they might aid with a gift of some of the steel-work and its welding, and they might perhaps contribute a couple of scholar ships. But their main contribution should be in providing mechanical and instructional aid in the Technical School which will form so important a feature oi the College curriculum* 11. For the rest, if His Highness would nake a private donation to help the College tide over its expected heavy deficit in the first two years, I think it would be reasonable to expect the Bahrain Government to defray H' Xf Hi .' c ^ cost, and to expend Hs.10,000/- to Ha.15,000/- annually on Higher Education. I am convinced His Highness and his Government would willingly do so, for apart from ^be direct benefits/benefits to be galned t the prestige that would accoue to Bahrain has for them an Immense attraction* Yours sincerely,i|P Kuwalt f 26 June 1939• n Daar Bolgrava f You aaka(?. ae to x&gt;ut on pepar sn outline of the education^ al ochenes which wa dlecuesod at the Advl aerate oil JUne 22nd f and here it ls # As you know, I have aeon all the Qovurnnent schools In Bahrain, and you rre now welting for my report* 1 am at present going around the schools of Kuwait f and as for i'uaoat - where I believe the education is negligible - although I have not been asked to go there I have been ©ble to have ssveral talks about the place *lth Sycrd* In due course the two reports which I am preparing will go in, and certain local improvements ?nd even innovations may be made as a result of them, which vdll be all to the good* But those more adjustments of the existing educational system will hardly touch the fringe nf a ztvtah larger and much more Important problem, one v fhich I think ought to overshadow all petty matters of educational administration or routine, and all purely local considerations. whet T want to talk about is the immense danger to the Gulf of its present educational state of affaira, and the splendid opportunity which now exists of doing, at quite modest coat, e job of work which would turn the anti-British flank in the Middle pest, and go a long way towrrds isolating the Oulf from the extremely dnngcroua influences of the Arab states to its north-west, especially from those of Iraq. In these ports, and in these days, politics mesne 'prog ress', end since 'progress” means education, education has become politics. ^hat is happening educationally,ie* politically, in your paid, of the world is this* The more intelligent young men of the Gulf, as soon as they reach the very low leaving-standard of their local schools, a re demanding higher education, which they desire for utilitarian purposes alone*/$) • 2 - alone. Not finding it at home f they travel in search of itf some of them are even being sent in search of it* at Government expense, by the Golf governments themaelvea.

I need not say much about Sgypt or India, for %ypt is considered by most Gulf parents and governments to be too far away, therefore too expensive, to send their young men to 5 and fewer young men from the Gulf each year ere looking east* wards for their education to Indie. As regards Gyria aaS the Lebanon, I heard Lord Lloyd say, about e year ego, that he was satisfied that the /merican University of Beyrouth was one of the chisf sources of anti-British propogands in the Ifldcl* ^st. As for Iraq, one has orly to look at history, rnd to draw uxxm personal experience. Iraq h^as for centuries been a centre of trouble. She ie etiU to-day a country of assassination, violence, treachery, vengence, unrest, and corruption of all kinds. Her schools, more eapeci^lly those of Banded, are hotbeds of cheating, lying, immorality, insurrection, Indiscipline, ignorance, and in efficiency. Everyone who has lived in Banded knc-:^ this. hat is not so well known about Iraq is that education ally, and therefore politically, she now h^s her eyea upon the whole of Arabia south of Basra, especially upon Kuwait, Bahrain, the Kamrfhrajnaut, the omen, ptA Saudi—Arabia. ihe perhaps does not yet quite know what she wants to do in those places, or quite ho* to do it, but she has at least realised the iaportance of getting hold of the young men, and has made a very good begin ning by spreading her pan-Arab and anti-Britieh propaganda,and by instilling subversive ideas into the minds of ell those youths who visit her for educational purposes of their own free-- 3 - will f or vho are htr invltad axxl no n&gt; - paying guests at the various ''higher* schools of Bagdad* Iraq has no** in her capital quite a nutiber of thee ; invited, non-paying, educational guests* Those «hom X know about personally cone from Kuwait, Muscat, 3audi-Arabia, the Handhraaiaut, the Yemen, end even Aden* Such ycunj men, though always far belw the required educational starxlard (itself very low), are usually pieced In one or other of the Higher Teachers 1 Training Colleges, o;”* rx the Law College, and occasionally at the Bagdad Centre!

For both Bahrain and Kuwait Vallance made the sound criticism that the boys knew nothing of the history of their ow^ State . With regard to Bahrain in paragraph 14 of his report of 26th June he wrote as follows, &lt;Vallance did not number the paragraphs of his Bahrain Report, but i have done so for him.

'At neither place (i.e.Bahrain or Kuwait) had anyone made it his business to provide the schools with a Xooal History, or a History of the Gulf 5 with the result that while Gulf boys know nothing whatever about their own long history, or about our 150 years 1 ' protection of their shores and their liberties, they know (from Damascus history-books) all about the struggles for freedom of the various / oppressed H. Weightman Esquire, ICS., Political Agent, Bahrain, c/o Postmaster, Ziarat.V % - 2 - oppressed and ill-used Arab States• M In regard to Kuwait, in paragraph 10 of his report of 28th June he wrote: ••The next thing i ought to mention is the necessity of cultivating in the school-children a proper feeling of patriotism, and by this i mean a patriotic feeling for Kuwait, rather than for the Arab world as a whole# I was sorry to find many of the boys, at all t f oux schools, using exercise books which bore on their covers the portrait of a foreign ruler and the name of a foreign State* This should be absolutely forbidden and if any portrait is to be placed on the school exercise books it should be that of the Shaikh of Kuwait. I was glad to find that there is a -National Song, composed by a Kuwaiti, and learnt and sung in the schools: but there is no history of Kuwait in use there, and this defect ought to be remedied at once# A commission should be given to some competent person to write, for an agreed fee, a school history-book, dealing only with the history of Kuwait before they begin to learn any other history: for this reason the book should be written in an extremely simple style, suitable for the lowest classes in the schools# we cannot expect to fiixl the full measure of patriotism in our subjects unless we have taken some steps to foster patriotism in them while they are still children at school#' 3. Galloway in paragraph 4 of his letter of 10th July 1939, JNo#C/273, lnot sent to you), said that he had asked irallance if he would write the Kuwait history, and Vallance agreed / provided-3- / provided he were paid £ 100/- for higher and lower grade History, to include Arabic translations# The figure appeared to Galloway reasonable, as it does to ©e, and 1 a® of opinion that Vallance is the obvious authority to produce such a History both for Kuwait and Bahrain. The payment to Vallance for a History of Bahrain would presumably be the same as for a History of Kuwait* I quite agree with Vallance that such Histories would have an excellent effect. 4. The payment for these Histories in each case would be made by the Bahrain and Kuwait Governments on whom also would fall the cost of printing, if you see no objection please write to Vallance and ask him if he is willing to write a similar History for Bahrain as for Kuwait and for the same payment,i.e. £ 100/-, and if the reply is in the affirmative, which I imagine it will be, please approach the Bahrain em inent* Galloway should ask the Shaikh of Kuwait whether he is prepared to pay the £ 100/- to Vallance for the Kuwait History, and if the reply is in the affirmative, which i think it will be, since it will appeal to the local patriotism of the Bhaikh and his Council, Vallance can be informed accordingly. 5. Both the Histories of Bahrain and Kuwait will have to be vetted by us before being issued, as in their later Chapters they will touch on foreign affairs and our connection with these States. This should be explained to Vallance, and he should be asked to be good enough to let us have copies ol the Histories in English before he begins the Arabic translation. r Ahen these have been approved of by us, after consultation with the India Office and the Goveriiment of India, drafts in Arabic can be submitted to the Shaikhs of Bahrain and Kuwait for their approval.ttkfc*.. © 4 6 ® in addition to the above two Histories there should certainly in my opinion be a third ones that of our beneficent connection with the Arab States referred to by Vallance, covering not only Kuwait and Bahrain but also the Trucial Coast and Muscat® This History would be taught in both the Kuwait and Bahrain schools, to whom copies would be supplied free.

My comments on contract are: Paragraph 1. Belgrave’s contract is subject to three months' notice and this should suffice. Paragraphs 6 and 7. Is he to get furlough as well as leave ? Both are mentioned but as he is in a vacation (? ) department his case differs from other State employees. Paragraph 7. First sentence is not clear. 2. Demi-official.

(c) A first class return passage on leave by sea and rail to the United Kingdom will be granted on the completion of efch two years of approved service. 4. I think this will be sufficiently clear. The trouble in the first instance was that Belgrave’s own contract, for the drafting of which we were apparently responsible, was taken as a model. 1 have had to use in paragraph 7(a) the words ”his present residence” because 1 am not sure where Vallance is now though I suspect he is in Basra. If this is so the draft could be amended accordingly.5. A« now drafted the agreement provides for a free return paesage home every other year during the summer vacation.

All that I have done concerning the proposed history of Kuwait is to mention the matter to the Shaikh. He recoiled from the suggestion of a hundred pound history as from an attacking viper. I wrote to P.R on those lines, and suggested the shelving of the matter until the situation regarding Yallance was cleare^ adding that I thought that all Kuwait would ever agree to was that one of their own schoolmasters should write a history. I thought that if Vallance were coming to Kuwait as a whole-timer he could write the history as part of his duties. 3. We had Dundas of the British Council here the other day, and he showed some despondency at the view of the Politicals that they should direct education, and that they know best how to spend funds provided.

Vallance told me /.hen I saw him in 'Baghdad that he was walking to the Baghdad Engineering school, having made up his mind to accept a oost that had been offered him, but that on the way he called in at the Embassy, ( as he hao heard previously from them ), and having read my letter decided to turn down the above mentioned offer. He explained that it was fortunate that he had received my letter when he did, or he would not have been available for the work we are offering him. It will be seen that Vallance now writes in direct contra diction of what he told me. I did of course ask Vallance to reply by telegram, but that was to avoid any unnecessary delay. rhe request did not obviously in cny way make a promise of emoloyment from the date of Vallance r s turning down of often employment. However , as Vallance did turn down work on receipt of our tentative offer, a speedy settlement seems to be called for in fairness to him. Yours sincerely, Ihe Hon'ble Lieut-Colonel C.G. Prior, dlj..

Dear Gallows^ , Please excuse this letter being typewritten: I have only this thin paper handy , and it is not very suitable for inx. Tnanxs very much for your letter. 1 only hope the permission fr^m India, end the British Council adjustments, will not take very long. I am very anxious indeed to get started at Bahrain, rnd of course the term has already begun* Thanks for sending me a copy of the proposed Contract. I think this is in most respects extremely generous, but there are one or two minor points which I should like to discuss, would and I should therefore be glad if you/kindly let me know whether they should be discussed with you or with Belgrave. The chief one is in connection with the date of commencement ol the Contract. I very much hope that this can be considered as being October 1st, for if not, I shall lose about £*75. As I think you know, 1 was engaged by the Ministry of Bconomics and Communications here to teach English at the Engineering School, at £.50 a month, resident, beginning on October 1st. On September 29th your letter reached the Embassy, and 1 got it the next morning. As one sentence read: 'Will you please let me have a telegram saying whether you are willing to accept the post or not ?' , and as you /?v you aaiced me to get tne Embassy to reply in code, and and added; ’’Please also say from what date you will be available”» I assumed that tne matter was urgent and immediate, and therefore got: myself released from tne ctner engagement and they wired to England for another man in my place. The same day 1 asked the Embassy to wire you that I accepted, and that I could come immediately. As you know, it then turned out, through no fault of mine, that there was to be a delay, which is still continuing. Had I known that this would have been so, I could have taken on the other job temporarily, and by the middle of this month I should have earned £.75, as well as having had free board at the school. Please don’t think that I am complainings I only want to put the facts before you, and to ask that the date of commencement should be counted as October 1st, the date on which 1 accepted the post which was then contemplated. kn ow w ith 1 get is no Anyway, I should be most grateful if you would let me to whom I should write, about small deteiIs in c onnection the Contract, or whether it would be best to wait until to Bahrein. You say in your letter that the Contract t in its final f orm.

Nearchus, at Debai» ed the 2nd December, 1939. ,f- d * Please refer to your demi-official letter No.0/687- l.b/5, dated the 30th October 1939, forwarding Vallance’s report. I am afraid ± should be inclined to put it the other way about and say that though there is much with which one violently disagrees, it has its good points. 2. In the first place the report should not have been addressed to the Shaikh. Belgrave is the head of the administration and should be the sole means of communication between Europeans and the Bahrain Government. Vallance^ •Your Highness^ on every page (the concluding one has a barrage of no less than five) stick in my throat, and the sycophantic balderdash about the police on page 64 (for Belgrave*s benefit) makes me quite sick. 3. To be candid, 1 do not like Vallance’s appointment and I have only agreed to it because of your insistence, the subsidy from the British Council and in the hope that it may enable us to keep Bahrain^ at home. There are many obvious drawbacks to his appointment, and i shall be agreeably sur prised if we do not discover t others as time goes on. In the first place,there is the patent disadvantage of adding to the team of Europeans already employed by the Bahrain Government, and secondly that they will soon find that Vallance*s pro posals are going to coat far more than they realise. 4. Another point that sticks out very clearly, although Vallance is thoughtful enough to keep it in the background / till H.Weightman Esquire, I.C.S., Political Agent, Bahrain.-2 till page 35, is that he had designs on Bahrain hims--i.f» he evidently took a fancy to the place, and realised its possibili ties while at the same time the wind in Iraq, grew colder• Of course, everyone is entitled to think of themselves, but my point is that he is not entirely disinterested vis a vis Bahrain, and his mendacious claim for compensation shows trial we shall have to keep an eye on him. 5. The statement regarding infants* education in the second and third paragraphs of page 9 is ; so far as **■ know, utterly untrue, and it is the universal practice to retain the more highly qualified teachers for the secondary schools and pay them at a higher rate. The neglect of the children’s health is regrettable, but I think that a survey of all the primary and most of the secondary schools in India not under European management would show similar results. If a school doctor (an Indian lady doctor would be less expensive and quite suitable for the younger boys) can be engaged it will of course be excellent, but Bahrain is, 1 regret to say, by no means unique in her present position. 6. It is the patriotic propaganda mentioned at (3) (4) (9) and (lO) of page 18 which causes one the liveliest apprehension and it is clear from his remarks on page 19 about “race integrity* that Vallance has not the remotest idea what he is talking about. It is true that as subsequent ly developed by him these subjects have innocuous air, but remarks like the concluding sentence on page 22 can and will be misconstrued. I am very sceptical of the possibilities of inculcating patriotism and *Reverence for the flag* by lessons in school but having never received such instruction / myselfv59 ^&lt;5 3 % -3- myself perhaps I do not appreciate their finer points* Vallance * s acquaintance with Iraq is too short to remember how in the ninteen twenties all the Britishers on the Iraq pay roll were far more Iraqi than the Iraqis themselves and full of zeal in teaching them that they were 'on an absolute equality* with other nations* The only harvest of this seed was a fine crop of xenophobia, and the sack for most of the sowers as soon as the Iraqis came into power ! 7* I entirely disagree that all children should be taught Snglish* When I came to Alwar I found the usual hash had been made of education (two-thirds of the money spent on one-tenth of the boys l) and I was able to get the Educational Commission* er with the Government of India to come and advise how to re-organize it. He laid down the principle that all primary education should be in the vernacular and that where English was taught after the fourth standard some fee no matter how small should be levied* When I went out to 4in al Hakim recently at Bahrain the gardener’s son greeted me by saying 'goodnight' though it was full afternoon. What is the use of pumping English into these people ? 8. I entirely agree with Vallance that the Technical School should be encouraged in every possible way, and that schools should encourage boys to enter it* Most of the Chiefs Colleges in India now include some form of manual train ing in their curriculums, and it would be sin excellent thing if all the Bahrain schools copied this* You have mentioned in various reports that the Oil Company is the destination of the majority of Bahrain schoolboys. Let us recognize this frankly and adapt the higher schools of the State to meet it* / *• '-4- (kj &gt; Or ^ 9* The strictures on primary education on page ll reflect little credit on Belgrave and you may tell him so* 1 do not wish to give the impression that I disagree with everything that Vallance has proposed* His report is 0 interesting and has shed a great deal of light bn dark places and I heartily concur in his remarks or proposals on pages 37, 44, 45, 49, most of 50, 52, 56, 58 and 60* 1 am afraid his recommendation about the Qur’an in the penultimate paragraph of page 47 will be misquoted some day, though the view held is sound enough*Confidential No.C/883 of 1939.

The Council have noted that the Bahrain Government are anxious to engage the services of Mr. C.R.L.Adrian-Vallance, formerly of the Iraqi Education Department, for the purposes of teaching more advanced English in the Bahrain high School and of taking general charge of the State education. On the recommendation of the Political Resident and of Mr. C.A.E.Dundas, the Council's representative in the Near East, they are willing to consent to the proposed transfer provided that Mr. Adrian-Vallance shall be allowed to i visit Kuwait from time to time in order to advise the Shaikh on educational matters and to inspect Kuwait schools.

P.Z.822/1^40 dated the 14tn February ly40 in regard to the British Council*s grant towards the pay of Mr. Adrian Vallance ? 2. Although the Council 'feel confiaent that we may rely upon the money being available in future years** it is a little disconcerting at this stage to find that actual sanction exists only for a single payment of £ 500/-. It is true that previous correspondence from the India Office and the Council does not in so many words promise a recurring grant, but references to the provision pf^ w a sum of £ 500/- in a full year certainly do not indicate tm.t a single grant was contemplated. The terms of your telegram Wo. T/385 dated the 21st October 1039 made it sufficiently evident that our object was to obtain Vallance for Bahrain for a period of years and that the Bahrain Government proposed to engage him on tne understanding that the British Council would provide a subsidy of £ 500/- per annum . Surely that was the time to warn us that we had misunderstood the situa tion and that the Council could only promise us a single grant. a contract with Mr. Vaiiance for a period of five years and may claim that in doing so they have been grievously misled by us. Of course the contract is terminable on short notice but that does not really make our position any the more comfortable.

I discussed this matter with Shaikh Abdullah in his capacity of Minister of Education and gave him a copy of your letter to consider. Shaikh Abdullah, after consulting Kis Highness and Shaikhs Mohomed and Sulman, has decided to accept the offer of the British Council to provide a new Director of Education in place of Mr. Vallance. Shaikh Abdullah considers it essential that the Director of Education should speak Arabic fluently besides having suitable qualifications and experience of teaching. Personally I regret dispensing with Mr. Vallance who, although he has not ingratiated himself with the local Arabs has worked hard and successfully reorganised the government schools in Bahrain. Unfortunately His Highness and Shaikhs Mohomed and Sulman take scarcely any interest in the schools andand know nothing of the work which is done in that direction.

Memorandum:- I have today discussed your letter NO.C/876-4/16-A dated the 3rd September, 1941, regarding the employment of Mr. Wakelin with Shaikh Abdulla bin Isa, Minister of Education. Shaikh Abdulla is willing to accept Mr. #Vakelin as successor to Mr. Vallance provided that he comes on probation for one school year,(15th September - 15th June). Shaikh Abdulla feels that as the British Council has not been able to offer to the Bahrain Government the names of more than one candidate the Bahrain Government has no choice in the matter as the need for someone to fill the appointment is so urgent. Shaikh Abdulla suggests that Mr. Wakelin should be informed that he will be retired to give lessons himself in the college as was done by Mr. Vallance. Mr. Wakelin will receive the same salary as was drawn by Mr. Vallance, £800/- per annum. He will be provided with free furnished quarters but, as in the case of other Bahrain Government officials, this does not include plate and linen. He will be provided with free transport while on duty and his leave will be the- 2 - annual three months school holiday. lie will be granted first class fare from Egypt to Bahrain on taking up the appointment and a similar fare from U K Bahrain to Ijfflypt on termination of his service.

' s Dear Colonel Prior, With reference to your telegram No.T/597 of 7th September, I an very pleased indeed that the Government of Bahrain has accepted Wakelin as Director cf Education, Personally I an ruite satisfied that he will ao the job extremely well and I can speak very highly of his work for the Council since he has been in Egypt. I an afraid that I should have realised the Government of Bahrain would require several people to choose from. Unfortunat^ey our shortage of staff is so great, particularly of people of the calibre re quired, that there is no-one else I could possibly spare who would fit the bill. I might have sent you a number of names to choose from but they would not have had the necessary qualifications. As it is, Wakelin will leave a hole in our organisation here which will be very hard to fill. Yours ever C.A.E.Dundas. The Hon.

(irant of visa to Mrs. t/akelin.Confidential. D.O. No. 2242/2E-9A. Bahrain, Novr. 22, 1941. Bear Alban, Wakelin has not yet signed his agreement and it appears to me that there has been a slight mis understanding about it. I understood that his conditions of service were to be similar to those of his predecessor but I find that deGrenier sent him a draft agreement on the lines of Hutchings f s agreement saying in the covering letter that he did so at your request. Hutchings is not provided with a free house; Wakelin is provided with free furnished quarters. Medical attention is provided for both as in the case of all other officials. Wakelin has been given the house previously occupied by Vallance, which the government has on lease, as there are no government quarters vacant. He now finds that the house is unsuitable for a family although in the past quite a number of married people have lived in it. I know that compared to Cairo the houses here are very inferior but I do not think he appreciates this and he expects to be pro vided with several bedrooms, nursery etc., which is not possible. Actually I had no idea that he was married until I got back here and I think that Dundas should have informed us of the fact. We do not undertake to provide married accommo dation for Bahrain Government officials though in fact I always try to provide suitable accommodation when people have families.l - 2 - i I am sending him the enclosed letter and will do what I can to help him hut I should like to know whether you had any particular point in view in substituting Hutchings's agreement for the one which Vallance worked on. Perhaps deGrenier mis- understood your suggestion. Yours sincerely, Major R. G. S. W.

Bahrain, Mott. 22, 1941 Dear Wakelin, I have received your letter of the 18th Novr• on the subject of married accomodation. As in tho case of your predecessor the Government agreed to provide free furnished quarters for the Director of Sducation. It does not undertake to provide accomodation for famines although actually in the case of married officials when it is possible they are allotted houses which are suitable for a married couple. In your case we did not know that you were married until after you had arrived here. The house^whlch you are living has been occupied by various people, some with families, inclu&amp;in£ Dr. &amp; Mrs. Thoms with several children, Wtag Gomnander^ and Mrs. Coates and lately Mr. and Mrs. Vallance. The building does not belong to the Government but is leased from a private owner. A considerable amount of money has been spent on it lately in repairs, paint-* ing etc. The drainage system was put in by the land lord, an Arab, I have not had complaints about it before but I understand that it is now unsatisfactory and a new septic tank is now being built similar to those in other houses. The bathroom can also be improved. There are at present no other government quarters vacant. If one of the Law Court flats becomes empty it would be possible for you to take it over. These flats were built with the intention of the large room being — y. I. Wakelin, Ssquire, Director of Sducation, Bahrain.being used as a dining and sitting room which allows ono largo and ono small bedroom. There is no pros pect of converting the two flats into one large flat. The other alternative is for you to draw house allowance, at the rate of Rs. 100/- per month, and for you to hire a house or flat by private agreement. The flat occupied by Mr. Blddick belongs to His High ness and was let to Mr. and Mrs. Leared for Ea. 100/- per month. This would be available when Mr. Blddlck leaves. There is another similar fiat next door to it which lets for fit* 60/- as it has no water laid on, it would be possible to put In a water supply etc. Shaikh Abdullah is living in his house and I understand that it is only empty during part of the year. Khalil Moayed has a house on the sea road which used to be occupied by Mr. .iteele and his family, it is now empty and I believe the owner wishes to let it. On® cannot compare houses in Bahrain to those in Cairo, it is only quite lately that any of them have had water laid on or European sanitation and the local style of building is admittedly very infe rior to that of Egypt. At present the Education Department office is on the ground floor of your house, should you prefer to draw house allowance it is understood that the Government would make other arrangements about the office. Alternately I am willing to have the office (and store) moved to another building, perhaps one of the rooms in the Kulllyah and you can occupy the whole of the building in which you are now living. It would then be possible to have the kitchen and dining room on the ground floor. Yours sincerelyConfidential Political Agency, D.O.

Adrian-Vallance held the post of Director of Education in Bahrain from November 1939 till July 1941. He tendered his resignation at the end of the school term in July 1941. During the school term of 1940-41 Mr. Vallance instituted and carried out a number of improvements in the government schools mostly on the lines of the recommendations which he made to the Bahrain government and which are described in his compre hensive report on education in Bahrain which he made in 1939 before his appointment to the post. The most important changes which he made were the reorganisation of all village schools and the institution of the Secondary School or the Kulliyah. In addition he regularised the teachers into different grades and organised the distribution of school books and material, he raised the age of admission to the schools and eliminated the over aged young married men who previously monopolised the upper classes. Mr. Vallance continually stressed the necessity for better teaching in the junior classes which had previously been regarded as needing the least quali fied teachers. He visited Palestine and obtained the services of a number of well qualified teachers recommended by the educational authorities in that country and also enlisted several better educated Bahrain Arabs to teach in the schools. He instituted daily physical drill in the schools and regular visits from —from the State Medical Authorities which have resulted in a noticeable improvement in the health of the students. Repairs, alterations and enlarge ments were carried out in many of the school build ings on Mr. Vallance^ recommendations. Mr. Vallance started a special class for young Shaikhs, in the afternoons, in which he taught himself. The class started with 19 young men and the fact that when the novelty had worn off the attendance declined was not the fault of the authorities. He also started special classes for the boys who failed to pass the entrance examination for the Kulliyah and who had progressed as far as they could in the primary schools. Although Mr. Vallance was not an expert in technical education he ran the Technical School during the term, receiving some assistance from Mr. W. B. Steele, the State Engineer. In the Kulliyah Mr. Vallance gave lessons daily in English, Grammar etc., and introduced new teaching methods with great success. He also dealt with catering and the domestic side of the school which contained a number of boarders from Kuwait and from Bahrain. In spite of their lack of sound groundwork the boys in the Kulliyah made good progress during the term. Before the end of the term an examination was held for entrants into the Kulliyah in the next term. The various changes which Mr. Vallance made were carried out after discussion with me and in all cases, except minor matters, with the approvalof Shaikh Abdullah, the Minister of Education. Some of the changes caused resentment among the public for example parents whose sons failed to pass the entrance examination into the TCulliyah expected their sons to be admitted if they happened to belong to the upper classes of Bahrain society. Another matter which was unpopular was the exclusion from the junior schools of boys who lacked the intelligence to pass into a higher school but whose parents wished them to remain in school. Parents of very young infants, who previously regarded the school as a cre^che, were indignant when small infants, incapable of learning, were not admitted to the lower classes where previously they had been conveniently 'parked' for the day. In the begin ning there was some complaint at medical inspections in the Muharraq school where the headmaster had un wisely failed to tell the boys why the doctor was coming to the school but at the other schools no objections were raised. The matters immediately preceding Mr, Vallance f s resignation have been referred to in previous corres pondence and a report on his vrork during the year is not an occasion for discussing them. Mr. Vallance worked under me and close cooperation with me, he A carried out changes in the educational system which, whoever had held the post, would have inevitably caused some resentment. With the object of improv ing education he adopted measures which were contrary to old established and unsatisfactory systems. Every new institution or improvement which has been started in —in Bahrain has at first been regarded locally with suspicion and mistrust; municipalities, girl’s schools, the minors’ department, diving reforms, etc. etc., were all the subject of public opposition when they were introduced. Some of the reforms which were introduced in the educa tion department provided similar opposition. In his contacts with the local Arab authorities Mr. Vailance was not altogether successful. He consulted Shaikh Abdullah only on general policy and did not discuss details with him and as a result anyone with a grievance about school affairs could obtain a hearing from Shaikh Abdullah who often had no knowledge of the matter under discussion. Mr. Vallance was not very accessible to parents of boys but his work, including giving daily lessons, occu pied most of his time. As a result of Mr. Vailance’s work, education in Bahrain has improved very greatly. The principles which he adopted and the methods and improvements which he introduced are now in force and no difficulties are being made by the boys or parents. The Kulliyah or Secondary School as it is now called, has increased to two classes, next year there will be a third class, and there was no trouble over the failure of boys to pass the last examination. A special doctor has been allotted as a school doctor and every school is visited at least once a week, and in general the recoEinendations made by Mr. Vallance are being carried out by his successor. During his time as Director of Education in Bahrain Mr. Vallance achieved results which should enableenable his successor to continue the progress of education on sound lines without provoking the feelings of the local inhabitants and with realConfidential No. s&gt; C/34 Tho Political Agent, Bahrain, Presents his compliments to :— The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. and has the honour to send him a copy of the undermentioned document ( s ) The Agency, BAHRAIN, Persian Gulf Dated 10th January 1942 7c Reference to previous correspondence : y/\ „ 'y Bahrain Printed Letter No. C/1189 dated the 22nd December 1941 Description of Enclosure Name and Date. Subject Report on Mr. tf.R.L. Adrian- Vellance by the Adviser to the Bahrain Government, dated 7th January 1942. QX\ Director of Education, Bahrain,Confidential. D.O. No. V'T /SP. Bahrain, Jany. 26, 1942. Dear Wakefield, One of the matters which was pending when Alban left was the signing of Wakelin’s agreement. He came here in September from Cairo, where he the recommendation of Dundas, the Council’s represen tative in this part of the East. The Council contri butes 5500. yearly to the Bahrain government towards the pay of a British education officer. I was away when Wakelin arrived and there was some misunderstanding about his agreement which differs from Hutchings’s, the Principal of the Technical School, in certain respects. The latter has no connection with the British Council though Dundas appears to have showTi a tendency to envelop him too in the Council’s folds. Recently I prepared a new draft agreement for Wakelin. His predecessor, Vallance, had a five year agreement, Wakelin however, '’g to Political Agent’s letter No. C/876-4/16-A dated 3rd September 1941, is seconded from the British Council’s service for two years therefore it would appear that we can not give him an agreement for longer than two years. He himself wants a long agreement and he has now written to Dundas on the subject. The main difference is the question of passages. In any case a passage to United Kingdom is given by had been in the service of the British Council, on \ the—3 - 2 - the government on completion of service; Vallance was riven a return passage to United Kingdom when going on leave after two years service as well as passage on termination. Wakelin appears to be working satisfactorily but it is too soon for us to form a definite opinion as to whether he is really good at his job. We asked specially for a man with a sound knowledge of Arabic, Wakelin speaks Persian but his knowledge of Arabic is very slight. Apparently when Wakelin was sent here he was not given any details of his conditions of service and I gather that he did not really want to leave Cairo. He has asked for various concessions which we did not give to his predecessor, whose agreement was approved by the Political Agent and by the British Council such as family passages, provident fund etc. His predecessor was married but in the case of Wakelin nobody had any idea that he had a wife and family until he brought them to Bahrain. British employees who have been recently taken on, such as Furber, who left to join the army, Dr. Snow and Hutchings all had families but were not given any passages or allow ances for them. I think in this respect Wakelin should have the same conditions as Vallance had. Wakelin was dissatisfied with a good many things here, especially his house, which was the one in which Vallance lived, but he has now been accommo dated in one of the Law Courts flats and has no cause to complain.Nominally all education is under Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa Al-khalifah, ’’Minister” of Education and 1 have not yet discussed with him the question of Wakelin’s period of contract. Before I do so I should be grateful if you could give me any further details of the communication received from the British Council referred to in your C/876-4/16-A of 3rd September 1941, especially jfrith reference to para 3. \ Yours sincerely, E.

I am afraid there is little in the Agency records which will be of assistance in clarifying the question of Wakelin's contract. X will recapitulate, however, such material as there is. 3. On the 1st August 1941, Hollyer of the British Council telegraphed from Cairo to the Politic si Resident giving details of Wakelin*s qualifications, adding that the British Council was willing to second Wakelin for two years in the first instance and that Wakelin was willing to accept the post of Educational Adviser, Bahrain, if offered. Hollyer also asked for confirmation that the salary offered was '£ 800 a year in addition to house and car”. After making further enquiries about Wakelin, the Political Resident asked the Political Agent, Bahrain, to enquire from the Bahrain Government whether Wakelin would be acceptable as a successor to Vallance 'on the same terms’*. t f U l 4. The Political Agent then addressed you in his memorandum No. C/876-4/16-A dated the 3rd September 1941. After your reply (Memorandum No. 1745-2 E dated the 6th September 1941) had been received, the Political Resident —tf* / 4“ 6 telegraphed to Dundas as follows •- ’’Bahrain Government accept Wakelin as successor to Vallance on same terms first year being probationary. ’’Free furnished quarters'* does not include C.

' \ the Bahrain Government. 5. From this correspondence it seams clear that Wakelin was to be granted the same terms as Vallance, subject only to the difference in the period of the contract. H)ven the period of the contract could be made the same as in the case of Vallance if the British Council were willing to extend the term of Wakelin*s deputation to five years. Presumably the Bahrain Government would not object to this as (a) Wakelin*s first year is probationary and (b) the contract would, in any case, be terminable by three months* notice on either side.

I have received the bill from the British Council for expenses of Wak:elin T s transfer from Cairo to Bahrain, amounting to just under £300/- including fares of his family and cost of transporting a quantity of luggage and furniture by the land route from Cairo to Bahrain. It seems that the British Council paid all these expenses on behalf of this Government although they were at no time authorised by this Government to defray anything except the first class fare from Egypt to Bahrain for tfakelin himself, on taking up the appointment, which was mentioned in the terms of his Agreement. I have discussed the matter with Shaikh Abdulla who approves of my writing to you pointing out that we are not responsible for the additional charges which have been included. British Government officials in Bahrain are provided with furnished quarters and if they bring additional fur niture with them, as many have done, they do so at their own cost. Regarding the fares for Mr. Wakelin's wife and child, until Mr. tfakelin arrived here and stated that his family was following him the Bahrain Government was unaware that he was married.

Wakelin arrived in Bahrain on Octr 6, 1941 during my absence in India, he immediately took over his duties as Director of Education. He has carried out his work in a satisfactory manner without causing resentment among the public who for several years have made School administration a subject for legitimate and illegitimate criticism. Mr. 7/akelin, during his first term, has had several rather difficult incidents to deal with and he has handled them in a sensible manner. Soon after he took over,a group of students from Muscat arrived in Bahrain to be educated at the Secondary School where they remained for about two months refusing to work and behaving in a most unsuitable way. Eventually they were returned to Muscat. Mr. Wakelin displayed tact and restraint over this incident. During the term Mr. vVakelin moved the School Hostel from the building which it previously occupied to a new house where the boys are successfully installed. Mr. Wakelin has showed himself to be energetic in visiting country schools which have always lacked the amount of supervision which has been given to the big schools in the towns and he has made contacts with many of the fathers of the boys by visiting them in their houses and seeing them in his office. Education in Bahrain is ostensibly under the direction of Shaikh Abdul]*bin Isa who is known as the Minister of Education. Mr. Wakelin has endeavoured to discuss with Shaikh Abdulla all matters concerning- 2 - s&gt; A / education but, as in the time of his predecessor, it appears that Shaikh Abdulla is disinclined to take an active interest in education affairs though doubtless he would resent any action which he con sidered an infringement of his position. Mr. Wakelin has co-operated successfully with the Principal of the Government Technical School which although a separate institution is connected in many directionswith the other schools. Mr. Wakelin has worked well during his first six months and his qualifications and experience fit him for dealing with the educational work which is now being done in Bahrain. f’/?. /V. /Yo- fro fd ■ tz/n/sf-z .Certified that on the 1st June 1942 Mr. Wakelin was still in the service of the Bahrain Government.

Will you please let me know as soon as possible what dates for the visit would suit the Bahrain Government and Mr. Wakelin, and I will inquire from the Political Agent, Kuwait, whether those dates would also suit the Kuwait Government. I do not know when the school year at Kuwait begins and ends, but presumably this information can be obtained from Kuwait students now in Bahrain. ¥ Political Agent, Bahrain. /( tj'lkf (k\ GOVERNMENT OF BAHRAIN. D.O.IIo. 1063/33. Bahrain, 13, 194 With reference to your D.O.No.C/715 dated E3rd May, 194a. I must apologise for having stated, in correctly, that the Bahrain Govermrent had no knowledge that Wakelin v/as married until his family arrived. I was away when the letter referring to his wife and family arrived. £. I enclose in duplicate abstract of accounts which you sent me. 3. The Bahrain Government will pay all Wakelin’s travel expenses*but not those incurred on behalf of his family. Other British officials such as deGrenier, Snow and Hut chings also Burber and Vallance, who used to be here, receive no allowances to cover cost of families’ passages. The Bahrain Government will pay the invoice^No.1319 CH dated 3rd November 1941, amounting to £S.52.795 being the cost of air fare from Cairo to Bahrain. ^4. Regarding cost of conveying heavy luggage and furniture from Cairo to Bahrain by overland route. The goods, valued at £400/- filled a 6 ton lorry, according to the bill, and included a quantity of furniture. The Government provides officials with furnished quarters and any additional fur niture etc., which they import is paid for by themselves. Quite a lot of the furniture in my own house and in some of the other British officials’ houses is their own property and was purchased locally or brought in by them at their own expense. /5. As however V/akelin was required to come here by air he could not bring any of his heavy baggage with him and I think it is reasonable that he should be given an allowance to cover the cost of bringing a normal quantity of baggage with him. Dr. McDowall, the late Lady Ledical Officer was paid £]2.11.0d for her heavy baggage which she sent round by sea as she herself travelled by land. Hut chings was allowed £15/- for his heavy baggage as he also travelled by air. He wrote and asked if he might bring his wife and child, on his own responsibility and at his own cost, and he was allowed to do so. In the case oi *^akelin I think £20/- for dispatch of his heavy baggage would be a reasonable sum. // 6. I think the British Council in Cairo should have obtained previous authority from the Bahrain Government before incurring expenditure amounting to about £244/- on V/akelin 1 s family passages and the cost of sending furniture etc., to Bahrain which they say they did ’’on behalf o: the Government of Bahrain'. We gave them no authority to do this and if the Council representative had written to us on the subject he would have been told that the Bahrain Govern ment would not pay for anything except Wake1in T s fare and his own expenses.

The Schools in Kowait, as in Bahrain, are closed until the end of September. I do not think any useful purpose would be served by Mr. Jakelin visiting Kowait while the schools are closed. Our schools reopen at the beginning of October. It is very necessary that Mr. Wakelin should be here when the new term starts in order to deal with new entries and various other matters including the move of the Secondary School to new buildings. I suggest that he should visit Kowait in November when the schools there are open and when it would be convenient for him to be away from Bahrain. t — S. 3. Adviser to the Government.3^ Ho.C/923 .

J eference correspondence resting with my memorandum ted 28th June 1942, regarding Mr. Wakelin, Director of Education, Bahrain. i ^) 2. I enclose a copy of a letter No.PG/l/3A, dated 18th ft ~ (y ) March 1942, and of its enclosures, addressed to me by the British Council on the subject of certain expenditure incurred by the Council over Mr. Wakelin* s journey to Bahrain last October. Since its arrival, the subject has been under correspondence between the Adviser and myself. 3. The Bahrain Government have not unnaturally objected to the statement that these accounts have been settled 'on behalf of the Government of Bahrain. They point out that the corres pondence leading up to Mr. Wakelin*s appointment gave no grounds for the suggestion that they are responsible for the complete cost of transporting him, his family and his possessions from Cairo to Bahrain. The question of the liability for these costs was not specifically dealt with in the correspondence preceding his arrival, for the reason that Mr. Dundas himself suggested (vide your telegram No.407 dated 9th May 1941) that Mr. Wakelin should be employed under the same terms as his pre decessor: and the Bahrain Government accepted this suggestion h a , (vide your telegram No.T/597, dated 7th September 1941, to Mr. Dundas). Clause 7 of Mr. Vallance*s contract (copy for- warded with my No.C/336-lb/5 of 21st April 1940) provided for payment by the Bahrain Government of the cost of one first-class passage by rail and sea to Bahrain. A copy of this contract / wasvs -2- was sabseqteitly sent direct to Mr. Dundas, vide this Agency endorsement No*C/930-4/lG-3 f dated 3rd October 1941. 4. The Bahrain Qovern/aent have pointed out that, in the case of other British subjects in their employ, including Mr* Vallance, they have given no allowance to cover cost of families* passages, and in view of the clear reference to one passage in their contract with Mr. Vallance they see no reason why this rule should be varied in the case of Mr. Wakelin. They are therefore prepared to pay the first item in the statement of expenses (Annexure D to this letter), but not the second and third. 5. As regards the costs of transport of Mr. Wakelin* s baggage {shown as item 4 in Annexure D and detailed in Annexure B) I enclose a copy of paras 4 and 5 of a demi-official letter of the 13th JUne 1942 from the Adviser to the Bahrain Government (Annexure H). It will be seen that, despite the fact that Mr. Vallance* s contract made no provision for payment by the Bah rain Government of the cost of transporting his effects, they have agreed in the circumstances to pay £ 20 (English) on account oi this item out of a total of £184.395 Egyptian. In connection with para 4 of the Adviser* s letter, it may be noted that in your same telegram No.T/597, dated 7th September 1941, referred to above it was made clear to Mr. Dundas that free furnished quarters would be provided. 6 . I consider the Bahrain Government*s attitude to be reasonable and agree with them that the British council had no business, without their previous authority, to incur f on their behalf** expenditure amounting to some £ E.244 on account of transporting Mr. Wakelin*s family and luggage. 7. I enclose in duplicate copies of Mr. Wakelin*s agree ment with the Bahrain Government with the request that a copy may be forwarded to the British Council. Political^Agent, Bahrain.Patron: H.M.

Yusuf Abdul Razaq, Ahmad Al Mushari, Abdullah Zaid. Abdul Hamid Al Sana. With the exception of Abdul Haraid who works in the Customs Office all the Committee members are prominent merchants. They have no educational qualifications. This Committee meets at irregular intervals when occasion demands. It controls all im ancial matters, engagement or dismissal of staff, expulsions of pupils, and matters of policy. b. The Rais Al fcaaref . Shaikh Abdullah seems deeply interested in the school and is conversant with what is gating on. He is handicapped by his lack of experience of school organisation. Io will be a very excellent thing if he is able to avail himse o o offer of the British Council and visit the Soudan where he will be able to study an efficient, modern educational system. c. The I/Aidir Al Maaref . The real driving po**.er should come from the Director of Education. He should be a man versed in educational ways and should have a comprehensive knowledge of all ohat goes on l 11 the schools, and should be in close touch with the views of the general public. He is the Chief Inspector. Not only should he inspect but he should see that his recommendations are carried 0Ut ’ Abdul Latif Shamlan lacks these qualifications. He was unable to give me reliable information even about matters as simple as the number of classes in the school oeneath his office His figures for staff were also faulty. In all cases it was necessary for me to check personally any information that he gaV6# Since his return from his visit to Egypt he has adopted European dress. This has been a cause of considerable criticism. I recommend that, if a suitable man can be found, he be replaced at once. Unfortunately I am not in a posioion to recommend anyone for the post. d. The Director of Studies . Kamal Effendi is a Syrian from the Dar Al Maalemin, Halib, with 11 years teaching experience. He was engaged at the begin- ing of the school year. He is a good teacher and appears efficient and energetic. What authority he has over the ooner Head Masters is not clear. I recommend that there be a monthly meeting ol Head ^.as ters under his chairmanship to arrange details of the syllabus, time-tables, other questions of internal organisation and to exchange views generally. This is valuable in It leads to a unification of the work in all schools. It tends to overcome feelings of jealousy betv;een the Head Masters which are so frequently a serious o.*aKe on progress.IV^ -3- 2. School Statistics . Town Schools, Boys’ 4, Girls’ 3.

TO H i30Y3* SOIiDOLS . a. Jtaff. At the end of last term uho salaries of the Palestinian teachers were cut by 15&gt; In order to mxc them resign. Two of them did so. The reason for this action was that the Egyptian Ooverament is willing to subsidise their teachers who are working abroad. The aireotor of Education went to Egypt recently and through the Jlinister of Education in Cairo engaged 4 men for Kuwait. Half their salaries are paid by the Egyptian Govern- ment. They describe themselves as an^Egyptian mission? This action was taken without any reference to the Political Agent or me. All four are graduates with teaching diplomas and have had several years of experience. They will bo a very useful addition to the teaching staff. Originally they applied to be sent tc Iraq on the ex change system which operates between the two countries. They were given only a few days nowice by the Egyptian Authorities and ordered to leave for Kuwait. Their only alternative was dismissal. Three of them are married i»en with children. They have loft their families in Egypt. Two 3yrian3 have also been engaged this term as Head Masters of the l^ubarakieh and Gharqieh Bohools. Both are vrall qualified and experienced teachers. One is a married man with a family who are in Jyria. The usefulness of the men will depend largely on the conditions under which they live. In the evenings they have too much time on their hands and no places of recreation. A club for school masters should be started up at once. We have several such clubs in Bahrain. The main features art? a library magazines, games such as Ping R&gt;ng, Chess etc.* a radio r .nd where space permits Volley Ball, Tennis oto. Lectures, deb ates and plays aro organised within the club. b. Standard of Teaching . yany of the local staff have been recruited from the Secondary' School. Their Knowledge is therefore limited and their ideas of teaching methods primitive. It is therefore essential for these new qualified teachers to give demonstrat ion lessons and lectures on teaching aims and methods for the benefit of the local men. These should be arranged reg ularly. 3 main points emerge: 1. The only method used in all subjects Is that of learning by heart. This is true of subject? differing as widely as Arithmetic end English. 2 . Jue to this method the recognition of the relation ship between what is taught and the experience of the pupils (whether in or out of school) is completely lacking. 3. Insufficient opportunity is given to thq pupils to do things, to work things out for themselves. These methods intensify: the habit of not exercisingimagination, the inability to apply knowledge under novel circumstances and the inclination to sit and v/atch while others work. A oooy of a detailed analysis of teaching met hods used in the schools is attached, together with correct ive Instructions* These are to be distributed to members of the staff* The teaching in the Kindergarten classes in many cases is very good* This is done mostly by local teachers, some of whom were trained la Iraq.

The consequence is that when they are examined id is almost the first time that they have put pen to paper and the results are very x*&gt;or indeed. They can rarely set about the problem and when they do they are slow, inaccurate and untidy. English * The standard is very low Indeed, owing to the very poor teaching. Ths present method id for the pupils to learn by heart certain questions and answers, with the Arabic trans lations sandwiched between. A question in English produces either the translation in Arabic or a prepared answer not applicable to the situation. This must be changed through the example of the Egyptian ► f QAers. The book in use is the Oxford Reader. As the Egyptians have been trained to teach JjDngmnn’s New Method series I-reco^end that the boo&amp;s be changed♦ In many ways the New Method is superior to the Oxford series. It is too early to express an opinion as these classes have only been started a few weeks. The apparatus is scanty and poor, Drawing , The boys invariably copy bad drawings from the board, T The subjects chosen are sea shells, a door, a book, a box, a house, eto f , all of which are available as first hand models. The results are very poor as copies and useless as a means of self expression. e. Text Books. Religion From Egypt Arabic Readers ' Syria &amp; Egypt History ' Iraq Geography ' Syria Arithmetic None used except by teachers. These English Oxford Readers (are various. Bongs. From Iraq. f. Apparatus. In each school there are a few pieces of apparatus for the teaching of Arithmetic. ThC at should be pooled and complete sets made for each school. It is simple to construct and can be made by the staff or in the hand work lessons of the upper classes. Local carpenters can also help, Kaps, charts, models etc,, are badly needed for all schools. Jertain of the Head ?«asters are already making some. 3uoh activities should be a regular feature of Creography lessons. g. Buildings . During the past year two excellent schools have been built to rehouse the Ahmadleh and the Jharqieh Ochools. It Is hoped to rebuild the Qublieh this year. This will mean that all the four town schools will be in good buildings designed as schools. h. Health. There is no regular school Inspection, Boys who are very obviously 111 are sent to a special doctor. When I point ed out very bad cases of Trachoma I was always told that the boy would be sent for treatment 'Tomorrow*, I can not quote figures but the percentage of bad eyes is high. The major ailments appear to be eyes, sores and head diseases, A ruoh more satisfactory system Is for the doctor to visit each of the schools once a week. In Bahrain the Schools* Doctor visits each of the schoolsa week, there being a small dispensary at each school. The general health of the school boys has Improved considerably during the past 13 months because of this. An annuel record of Weights, Heights and Chest Measurements is also kept, i. Scouting and games . Each of the four town schools has its tro p of Boy 3cout£ I had little time to see much of their activities. They appear to concentrate chiefly on drill and marching. There do not appear to be any organised games. There are no regular inter school football or volley ball matches.__ -7- s&gt; 1 5• Village 3clioQla » (Boys) • The curriculum is limited to ohe study of tiie Qoran, Religion, Reading and Writing in Arabic and Arithmetic• This is as it should be* The standard depends entirely on the master and there fore varies considerably from school to school* As neny of the villages are isolated the teacher must be an inhabitant* For this reason it is difficult to suggest how improverent can be achieved. I was unable to visit what I am told is the best of these schools, on the island of Feilajeh, owing to bad weather, but of the seven others that I visited three were outstanding: viz: Al Jahrah f Al Dimna and Al Jha^beh. In these three schools the teachers are from Kuwait* The organisation is good and the work comp' rable to that of -he lower primary classes of the town schooK The thre schools of Al Howali, Al Buhleifeh and Al Fantas were particularly bad* Even in Religion, the one sub ject that one would expect to be taught well, the pupils were apallingly ignorant. Al Howali is His Highness* own village and two of his sons attend the school. It is also the nearest of these schools to Kuwait. It is therefore re: ar&amp;able that a good man from Kuwait has not been found particularly as the salary of 1 : 4*37 is far in excess of the usual salary of r^*22 for village teachers* I recommend the following changes in salary: Present Salary Revised Salary Al Dimna “TF 30 Al Sha*abeh 22 30 Al Jahrah (1) 39 40 Al Jahrah (2) 22 22 Al i'aheil 22 22 Or replace Al Buhleifeh 37 22 -do- Al Ilowali 34 22 -do- Al Fantas Al Feilajeh -—— Not visited — All these schools are in dire need of Arabic Booxs. I suggest that these teachers be brought into Kuwait occasionallji, to learn what good teaching is. 6. OIRLS* SCHOOLS * I visited the Girls* Schools after school hours* The buildings are all converted dwelling houses and as such are most unsuitable. In some cases the only light is from the door and a snail hole in the roof. New buildings are urgently needed* The Head distress of the Kutawasatch jchool is also Inspectress.

Drawing Singing*7 Trainees at Bahrain Technical School , In July of this year five boys completed their training at the 3ahraln Technical School and returned to Kuwait. 4 held Government and one K.O.J. scholarships. The K.O.J. Y/ii.1 not be able to ta*e them all on as they are closing down. They have offered their own boy a job with good prospects but he prefers a 'Get-Rlch-Quick” job with the Americans as an interpreter. All five hope to find jobs locally. The K.0.3. originally intended to send 10 boys to Bah rain this year but have cut down the number to five as they are now closing down. I discussed the matter with the Manager Mr. Scott but could not persuade him to send the full number so that they would have the necessary' trained men when they open up again after the war. The Sanraln Government could train 15 Kuwaitis at a time. These students live under supervision in a Hostel which is effeciently run. Recruits should be from classes 5 and 6 of tne Primary dohools. 8 . Hi.dier Education in Egy pt . During his visit to Egypt the Director of Education arranged to send 10 Kuwait Secondary Schoolboys to Jairo at the expense of the Egyptian Government to continue their studies. These boys have be*n chosen by the Committee from the ^ubarakieh School and will leave for Egypt next week. They are going unaccompanied. I suggest that the British Council in Cairo be approached and asked to take an interest in tiie welfare of the boys. 9. Niaht School . Hight classes in Bookkeeping, Arabic and Religion are held in a house in the bazaar. Ho charge is Kiade, the teachers being paid by the Educational Department. About a dozen attend 10. General. The number of highly educated men for whom jobs can be found in Kuwait is, and will be for some years to come, very limited. The addition of classes to the Secondary School Is therefore not desirable. Attention should be paid to the raising of the standard in the existing classes. When this has been achieved those Kuwaitis who wish to continue their studies may do so in Cairo, Damascus or to other centres deemed suitable. Throughftfthe schools the emphasis should not be so much on the acquisition of factual knowledge but on the building up an attitude to life. 3uch ideas as that of manual labour being degrading or that in disaster intensive effort is useless, because God is Great and the calamity is inevitable, must eventually be eliminated. Continual war should be waged against that attitude which accepts everything without question, without consider ing cause and effect. 'We accept your cars, your radios and your electricity but we refuse to interest ourselves in the struggles and calamities which made these things possible: nor can we accept any responsibility for the social results of &amp; process which mkes such industries possible.' This the true purpose of History and Geography* Lan guages, Science, General Knowledge; in fact nearly All sub jects can be taught with this aim in view.11. Educational Adviser^ Visits , I suggest that these visits which are officially 'up to one month in each year' be six-monthly and of a duration of a fortnight each.

During the following seven months the Schools were closed for the usual three months during the summer holidays and Mr. Wakelin was away from Bahrain during part of this time. The Schools continue to produce good results under Mr. Wakelin 1 s direction and the administration of the Education Department has progressed smoothly without undesirable incidents. At the end of the year Mr. Wakelin visited Kuwait and reported on education in that State. Mr. Wakelin continues to do well. After a year’s work he shows no less interest in his duties th&amp;n he did when he was a 'new broom' in spite of the fact that his post is not one which produces any spectacular results. His Excellency Shaikh Abdulla has expressed to me his satisfaction with Mr. Wakelin’s work.

Wakelin*s work durin£; the last six months of the school term has been most satisfactory. It is mainly owin.' to him that school affairs have proceeded throughout the term without any troubles or difficulties. In past years school administration in Bahrain constantly produced quarrels and disturbances usually caused by the foreign teachersj since the appointment of a British official at the head of administration the behaviour of the masters has improved. The work of the Secondary School and the management of the hostel reflects much credit on Mr. 'Yakelin and the standard of education in this school also the manners and outlook of the boys is considerably better than any thing which has been achieved in Bahrain in the past. Besides dealing with the teaching side Mr. Wakelin has been responsible for the catering and the domestic arrangement of the hostel. Mr. Wqkelin through personal contact with members of the Bahrain Petroleu;. Company has interested the Company in the possibility of employing more boys from Bahrain Schools in the Company’s operations and it is hoped that a number of boys will be taken on in clerical and other posts at the end of the present term.No.C/834 Political Agency, CD Bahrain, the 19th June, 1943.

The Bahrain Government have asked that the sum of Rs. 1110/7/0 jdetailed statement attached/Which they have expended on the travelling expenses of the Director of .education,Bahrainjon his visits of inspection to Kuwait may be refunded to them. 3. The Question of who should meet these charges has not been raised before. It was stipulated in paragraph 3 of Residency Express Letter C/639 dated 7th October 1939 (copy to India Office under Printed Letter No.C/640 of same date) that these visits should not involve the Bahrain Government in any expense. They are likely to be less welcome to the Kuwait Government if that Govern ment is asked to meet their recurring expenditure par ticularly in view r of the fact that the Director was originally proposed to be stationed at Kuwait. In these circumstances it seems reasonable that this expenditure should be met by the British Council and I should be glad if the Council could be approached to meet the charges already incurred and similar ciiarges in future. 4.

Wakelin has done good work during the last five months of the school year, which begun in - ^ October, in spite of difficulties due to the loss of some of the senior members of the teaching staff. Mr. V/akelin is now giving lessons himself every day in the Secondary School and in addition he frequently takes classes in the other schools, he is also giving lessons in Basic English to members of the Government Hospital staff. During the last year there has been a definite improvement in the teaching at the schools which is very evident to those who knew the schools a few years ago, this improvement is mainly due to Mr. Wakelin 1 s supervision.

In his referenc to village schools Mr. Wake1in is somewhat violent in his description of village conditions. It is true that tne people are poor, their living conditions are primitive and in these days they are miserably clad but their' physical condition is on the whole better than it was a year ago. f ^7 The 70 private schools mentioned in the last para of the report are with a few exceptions Koran schools. s.z. Adviser to the Government.Report oil the work of the Education Department during 1943. According to the annual stastics of the schools submitted with this report one new school has been opened and the number of students increased from 1360 to 1412. These figures in no way indicate the progress of the schools during the year. For the past three years our policy has been to restrict the number of pupils and at the same time to increase the staff and number of classes. The figures below give some indication of the extent to which this has been carried out during 1943. Formerly a complete primary school consisted of 6 grades. In October 1943 a seventh grade was added and the classes renamed thus forming 3 Kindergarten and 4 Primary grades. January to July 1943 . October to December . 1943. Av. Max . Min. Av. Max.

There are now 5 of these Primary Schools each with their Kindergarten sections as against 3 of last year, for in addition to the New School the Village School of Rafaa no ’^ been con verted into a Primary School. They follow a common syllabus and are provided with books for all students in all subjects. In October Handwork and Drawing were added to the curriculum. The increase in the number of classes has meant the engage ment of 10 additional staff. Lost of these were found locally, six being from the Secondary School. There has been a marked improvement in the standard of teaching throughout the year, particularly in the Kindergarten c-lasses. Scondary School . There are three forms in the Secondary School, In October last, at the beginning of the school year very few boys were admitted from the Primary Schools and promotion within the school was strictly limited. In this way it was possible to advance the curriculum by one year. Thus Form 1 is doing the woik of last year T s Foim 2; the new Form 2 that of last year’s Form 3 and the new Form 3 are 'working on a more advanced syllabus. The Primary Sducati.n of the present Secondary Schoolboys was, through no fault of their own, very poor. Their knowledge of Arithmetic did not extend beyond a superficial acquaintance of the Four Rules, Algebra, Geometry and Trigonometry were unknown to them. They had ’read three books 1 in English but could not make use of the language in any 'way. The History and Geography were limited to a few useless ’facts’ that they had committed to memory. It is on this basis that we have to build our Secondary Education. Arithmetic Algebra, Trigonometry, Science, History and Geography had to be taught from the begin-' ning. Thus we have the anomaly of Primary Schoolboys studying books which are used in the higher Forms of the Secondary School.3/ 2 In this lies the answer to the criticisms of our lack of enterprise in not teaching typing, and other secretarial and commercial subjects. So much leeway has to be made up in the subjects of the Primary School that it is as yet impossible to make additions to the syllabus. In a very few years time we shall find boys in Form 1 v/ho are more advanced than those in our present Third Form. The Hostel . The accommodation in the hostel has been considerably increased. Fight new rooms have been added to the 8 original and the kitchen, bathrooms and latrines completely rebuilt. There arenow 6 dormitories to accommodate 35 boys (2 dining rooms - one for the staff), a large games room, a library, a staff sitting room, 2 staff bedrooms, an office and a mosque. The boarders are under constant supervision and are expected to take their-part in keeping the building clean. Village Schools . There are three in number. In all cases the standard is deplorable. We have now overcome the difficulty of overcrowding by adding two of more class-rooms to each school. Where formerly 80 - 90 children were sitting on the floor of one room, each class has its own classroom and the maximum number is restricted to 40 per class. In only 3 classes out of 15 are there more than 25 per class. It is impossible to recruit suitable local staff, and teachers from the towns naturally refuse to reside in the villages. We therefore provide transport for the staff of these schools. Two boys from each of the village schools are living in the Hostel attending the Manama Primary Schools. In this way we hope to train them as teachers so that in years to come they may return to their villages as school masters. The poverty of the villagers is lamentable . They are under fed, miserably clad and carry the dirt and disease of years. To alleviate this we provide every village schoolboy with four loaves of bread per day and have during the year issued two sets of clothing to them. Staff . In August 1943 the Director of Education visited Jerusalem and Beirut in search of teaching staff. He was unable to induce anyone to serve in Bahrain as the salaries in their own countries we so much higher than the Government of Bahrain could pay. During the year we lost four of our foreign staff, two Palestinians and two Syrians. In three cases the reason was the attraction of very well paid jobs in their homeland. The fourth, the Headmaster of the Secondary School, resigned because of the ill-health of his wife. There are no local men who can replace them.i - 3 - Public Library . In Hay 1943 the Secondary School produced a play the proceeds from which amounted to Ri.3,400/-. This sum has been used for the purchase of books for a Public Library. The first consignment has arrived from Cairo and has been cata logued and it is hoped to open a reading roon in the near future. Private Schools . Prom a recent survey of private schools in Manama and Moharraq it appears that there are 70 in all providing edcuation for 700 boys and 667 girls.

Delgrave seems rather to be danning by faint praise which is in iy consideration rcnfair, and may be a reaction to Wakeli^s pertinent remarks about r^iilage conditions in his report. I have seen somethinr of the schools since I came to Bahrain and of Vakelin’s work. He is not having at all an easy time, quarrels among the school teachers, Mrs.BeU*rave Jealously guarding the girls schools from what she calls interference and others would call advice, and Hutchings brooding over the inefficiencies of the Technical Gchool like a gloomy raephistopheles. The reluctance of the Bahrain Government to pay adequate salaries to teachers from overseas has not made his work any easier. I am taking this up with Belgrave within the next few days. 3. Wake1in is no genius nor does he impress the casual observer with his organizing ability or erudition. He is a solid unimaginative miudle class person rrith a touch of the missionary spirit and is doing a very pood and sourr piece of work here in Bahrain. The Hobble Sir Geoffrey Prior, K.C.I.U., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Yours sincerely,COHFIDMTIAL D.O. ITo• 323-3. line the Dear ^aroe. rieaidency, Buahir e, 6 th April, 1944 Itl lA v' tfill you please refer to the proposals initiated ^owle in his derai-offioial letter Ho. 3/354 dated the 15th August 1939 to Peel with a copy to you, for a proposed Ciulf Collage at Bahrain? 1 f elt certain when 1 heard of this project that it was completely misconceived, and my first discussions with Dundas of the British Council confirmed that whereas the figures of income in the estimates were greatly over estimated the cost of the building had been largely under estimated. Eventually I suggested in ny 270-3 of the 1st May 1941 to tfeightman that we should drop the whole project until we had received the advice of the Educational Commissioner after he had seen .oahrain and the local conditions. ihe proposals also met with a good deal of opposition from Belgrave, most of it quite sound in it self, on the grounds that the proposals for a Gulf college would take the control away from the State without giving them any appreciable benefits and involve them in a great deal of expense without any very tangible results. ihe Educational Commissioner never came. by . . 2 . ihis much good emerged from all these discussions that Adrian Vallance was sent by the British Council, who subsidised him to the tune of £ 500 per annum. He showed a great deal of energy at the start, but was unfortunately lack ing in the tact required for this post, and the State asked for a change. -^he British council, who themselves considered Adrian^Vallance rather hot-headed, provided ue with a man called Wakelin who had formerly been in the Stewart Memorial » College at Isfahan and later as technical instructor with the A.i.O.C. ihe reports on him were quite encouraging, and he v/as sent to take over. 1 place below his report on the work of the Bahrain Eduoation Department for the year 1943 together • f with a copy of a demi-official letter from Hickinbotham i\o. C/401 dated the 29th February 1944. It will be seen that far from there being any case for a college at Bahrain, we have /- not yet succeeded in getting a decent secondary school, and it v/aa on this that 1 based my original objection to the pro posals. 1 felt certain that unless and until there v/as a really sound secondary school at Bahrain it v/as putting the cart before the horse to talk of higher eduoation or any super ior form of technical instruction. Wakelin entirely agrees with these views. 3 . It may be thought very discouraging that after all these years of controlling influence in Bahrain we should have such poor results to show. ihe reason is that until Adrian Vallance arrived the Education Department, which is uitier Shaikh Abdullah and not Belgrave, had been run purely for show and not for practical use, but it is quite probable Sir Ol&amp;f Caroe, K.C.I.5.* C.S.I., I.C.S., etc. etc.that it was no worae than that in neighbouring countries, where the only decent schools are those conducted by foreign anterrjriae. Wakelin does not get a great deal of support from Belgrave, and has a very discouragiiig row to hoe. if he is retained at the end of this year, or if he is succeed ed by another British Director of Education the conditions will gradually improve until we have one decent secondary school ard are able to send boys to Egypt or Palestine with sufficient grounding to benefit by further training, if he goes and is not replaced then we shall find ourselves back again where we were in 1932. 4. It is very disappointing that Bahrain has not yet been able to produce its own secondary school teachers, as the 'imported ones are tiresome in many ways, and this is partly due to the poor salaries which the Bahrain Government have hitherto paid. 1 think that Bel grave's ideas of finance are unduly conservative, and that he is still unconsciously guided by the corditiona that prevailed during the early years of his service in the Gulf. Hickinbotham is however pursuing the mat ter, and I hope that conditions will gradually improve. I visited the secondary school and one of the village schools during my last tour and agree generally with Hickihbotharo' &amp; remarks, but it is very difficult for me nowa days to give any time to these matters and 1 feel that we must leave it to V/akelin to introduce what improvements he can, as he can. I am sending a copy of this letter without l&amp;a enclosures to Peel. * lours sincerely, Sd • GEOFFREY PRIOR. * sent under P.L. 324-b dated 6/4/44 eon LJv J&gt;UX $ H~ April 1944 D.0.M 0 . n.3606-N/44. kydcM ^' CV ' c Please refer to your desd-official letter Ko«323 S» dated the 6th April. 2. le agree that the time to think seriously of higher education in Bahrain will not come until the state has set up a really good secondary school. The oiain trouble seems to lie in the poor salaries offered to teachers and it is to be hoped that Hiokinbotham 11 be able to persuade Belgrade to be more generous. I notice that Wakelin paid an abortiie visit to Palestine last year in search of teachers. At the moment ve are trying to find some really good Indian teachers of ItagUsh for Meshed, Kerman etc. and I wonder if the Bahrain Government could not be persuaded to offer a salary f ood enough to attract a well qualified Indian to each English to the higher classes in the secondary school and allow him to take private pupils out of school hours to supplement his salary? The British Council are alredy doing a good deal for Bahrain in subsidising Wakelin and an appeal to them for further assistance would hardly be justified even if it were likely to be successful.k 3* As re&amp;arde techiiLcal. training t . here . alao ve are arranging for paths from Persia to take courses at the Delhi Polytechnic.

Could not the present urgent need for teachers, for example, be met partly at least in this way ? 4. I am sending a copy of this letter to Peel. Yours sincerely, . (SD:) Rit..BURNETT.

I have talked the matter over with Belgrave and we are in complete agreement with the views set forth in this letter regarding the suggestions made in Burnett’s letter of the 27th of April. I am hopeful of seeing reasonable increases in the emolu ments of the locally recruited staff of the Educational and other Departments of the Bahrain Government in the near future. You will also be glad to hear that as a result of the revised terms coupled with what appears to be a slackening in the daman4 for teachers in Syria two of the Syrian instructors of the Technical School have changed their minds about leaving. 3. I ndian teachers of unglish Apart from the local disinclination to employ Indians there would of course be the difficulty ox the teacher proba bly knowing little or nothing of the local vernacular.

The Bahrain Government would however much like to have particulars of the Delhi Polytechnic for it might be desirable to send boys to that institution with a view to their eventually replacing 'Foreign' teachers.

These grants may have appeared to Representatives to be inexhaust ible in that it was almost always the case that supplementary demands on them were met readily and at once. It must be pointed out that this was due merely to the fact that many countries had been occupied by the enemy and were no longer open to the Council, so that considerable funds earmarked for them were released for use in other areas in which the Council could still operate • This state of affairs no longer exists* the Council’s work is now continually expanding into new areas; and the ay stem of Block Grants has been altered. Starting with the present financial year, eaq^enditure on Functional Services has been allocated country by country, both in the Local Functional Services of the numerous regional budgets, which show the expenditure yfoio h may be incurred locally, and also, as far _ , iy &gt; pcs sib le, in the budgets of the various Departments, the amounts earmarked for expenditure in London for the various countries being shown, for information, on Forms ACL. It is unlikely that additional funds will be available for Functional Services, and therefore expenditure on them must be strictly limited to the allocations for each country, unless prior approval of a supplementary allocation has been obtained through the Finance Division in London. as N0.797-S.
