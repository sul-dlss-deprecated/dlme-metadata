Dear Sir aeolTrey Prior, I am desired to refer to the oorrespondanoe resting with this Department secret letter No. 266~£(D )/44, dated the 10th of February, 1944. regarding the grant of leave to officers of the Indian Political Service under the Keynen Leave Scheme* 2. Borne doubt appears to exist as to the position regarding the grant of leave to the United Kingdom and it is felt that the following 'brief survey may be of assistance* It may, if you see no o'bjeotioa, kindly be 'brought to the notice of all officers of the Tnfl lari Political Service serving under your control* 3* Up till the spring of this year there was a complete 'ban on the grant of leave to officers to the United Kingdom except where such leave was essential on medical grounds. This 'ban was in some measure relaxed with the Introduction of th e Keynen Leave Scheme • under which selected Civil sns xiu officers are permitted to take a total of approximately six months* leave ex-India with a stay of four months in the United Kingdom* A limited number of passages are available each month and are allocated at the discretion of Departments of the Central Government and Provincial Governments: no allocation can be made for the families of civil officers and any officer with a family who wishes to be considered for leave has necessarily to make private arrangements for passages H ot his wife and ily* In practice it has 'been fbund that such passages can usually be obtained privately provided some two months* notice is given to a reputable public agent such as Messrs* Thomas Cook* There are two main disadvantages in the boheme from the point of view of the family officers; in the first place he has to travel to the United Kingdom inde pendently of his wife and. family and having got there has no prospect of being able to bring his family tack to this country with him or for some considerable time to come* 4. while tne above disadvantages have acted as a deterrent to any general desire for home leave, it has 'been possible for the Political Department to send on leave nearly as many officers as the postings pobitlon has allowed* Applications for leave under the scheme have, however, not been so great as to necessi tate, up to the present, the application of any strict order of priority* 5* So far as can be foreseen, there is likely to be little alteration in the position before the spring of next year* In due course, however, it may reasonably De expected that passages tor families will 'become available under the Keymen Scheme and when this occurs, it is visualised that many more officers will wish to take advantage of it* As soon as this occurs, it will 'be necessary to lay down a system of priorities and the date of the last return from a leave of not less than six months in the United Kingdom is likely to 'be taken as a primary factor in determining such priority; domestic considerations such as the separation of an officer from his wife and family, the necessity/- Ineoe&amp;elty oftaking ohlldron houa oOuoatioa and con siderations of lioalth will howarar also 'be glvan full weight. It suet also 'be fully realised, tbat the postings position as it operates fron tine to time nay in many oases pe a deoisiTs factor in the allocation of priorities. 6. It will he dear that in oiroumstanoes such as the present when the shola cadre is 'badly in used of hone leave, It will he unfair to grant IndlTidual officers a longer leave .than six months until such time as all have hoen hone. It leu therefore, proposed, «&gt;xcept in the case of leave on medical grounds, to limit the period of leave ex-India to six Mn ail months ofTioers In the serried have taken leave and returned to this country* It la at preaent dixTicuit to eatlnate bow lon^ it will take to effect the turn-over, as this oust necessarily depend (a) on the paaaa^ position and (t) on U&amp; nuefber of orricoro that can 'be srpared trm tbe oadre at any one cdiae, 'but It is perha ^a net unreaaooatle to hope tbat ty tbe spring of 1946 Mat officers ito have not teen on leave siace 153S or teftere may hare lxs«n granted leave and that the reoainin^ officers who last ex«Joyed leave in 1939 nay get to the United Kingdom during the following 9 oonths to a year.

PAUL, Deputy Secretary to the Oowanraent of India.Copy of letter from the Government of India, finance Department No. ^.44(11 )-W/44 f date d the 23rd August, 1944. -—&lt;&lt; • Subject:- Leave concession to officers of the Secretary of State's Services and the Central Services, Class I, owing to the conditions created 'by the War. Sir, As the Provincial Government are aware, the Government of India have had under consideration, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the question of encouraging officers to take short leave in India annually during the war in the interest of their health and efficiency. In view of the considerable strain to which Officers have 'been subjected in this period, it has been decided to grant the following concessions to officers of the Secretary of State's Services and Central Services, Class I, (other than officers of vacation departments and officers in foreign service) in service on the 3rd September, 1939, the date of outbreak of the war. I. Officers subject to the leave rules in tue i-Mnd^menbal -uuleg. (1) The maatimum amount of leave on average pay which may be granted in all under Fundamental Bules 81 (bj (i) and (ii) may be increased by one month for each completed year of service commencing on the 1st October, 1942. (2) The rate at which leave is earned under J'undamental Eule 77 or the maximum amount of leave expressed in terms of average pay which may be granted under JTundamental Eule 81 (a) will in no case be increased, Tfiie leave salary for additional leave taken under (1) shall be on average pay but subject to the monthly maxima prescribed in Fundamental Bule 89 (2). This leave will be debited in the leave account as leave on half average pay to the extent of double the period actually taken on average pay, but will carry no pensionary benefits. If combined with ordinary leave on average pay it will increase to that extent the llmitaa; prescribed in Fundamental Bule 81 (b) of leave that may be taken on average pay at any one time II. Officers sub.lect to the rules in the C iv il Service l-ve^ulationg . (1) The maYiTmim amount of privilege leave or furlough which may be grafted under Arts. ^46 and 316-A of the Civil Service Regulations may be increased by one month for each completed year of service commencing on the 1st October, 1942. (2) The rate at which furlough is earned or the maximum amount of furlough in all which may be granted to a Government servant will not be increased by the grant of additional leave. The additional privilege leave or furlough on average salary will be treated as furlough on half average salary for twice the period actually taken as privilege leave or furlough on average salary. The additional furlough on average salary will not count as an interruption of duty for the purposes of Art. 246 of the Civil Service Regulation and will not accor dingly forfeit any privilege leave which may otherwise be admis sible; but will carry no benefits other than the higher leave salary. III. QoTermnent servants sufrtegt W ~ov.s.jd L^ve ...ules, 1953. (1) The TnftTri TnnTn am mint, of earned leave admissible under Bule/-2- Bule 9 of the Jdt Be vised Leave Bules, 1933, may 'be increased 'by 15 days for each completed year of service commencing on the 1st Octo'ber, 1942. (2) The period of leave on private affairs shall 'be reduced to the extent of double the amount of additional earned leave taken under (1). 2 # The concession enumerated aboye will 'be admissible up to the end of September, 1945. Thus, the maximum period of additional leave on average pay admissible under these or ders which may 'be obtained 'by commutation of a lower type of leave will in the aggregate 'be three months in the case of officers governed 'by the Leave Bules in the JTundainental Rules and the Civil Service Begulations, and 45 days in the case of those governed 'by the Eevised Leave Kules, 1933. This leave will 'be admissible only in India. Any period of leave on average pay, privilege leave, furlough on average salary or earned leave enjoyed in Ind--a 'between the 1st Octo'ber 1942 and the 30th September, 1945 ut &gt; to ft matltmn ^ Tnnnt .vm -^vr shall first be adjusted against the additional leave admissible under these orders in respect of the period of three years ending the 30th September, 1945, up to a maximum of 3 months or 4b days in all, as the case may be. This concession lapses after 30tn September 1945 except to the extent that leave in India which has been applied for in writing during this triemium and refused in the exigencies of the public servicd WKfore the 30th September 1945, may, to the extent due, be enjoyed if granted before 1st October, 1946. 3. I am to request that the nature of these concessions may be brought to the notice of all officers eoncemed are serving under the administrative control of the . royincial Govemnents, as early as possible. Tto Governinent of India would also like it to be impressed on all authorities competent to sanction leave that tt as it is desirable to encourage officers x* at this stage of war to take as much recuperation leave as possible, leave intended for this purpose should not be refused except under very exceptional circuinstances. 4 I am to state that in view of the temporary nature of this concession the Auditor-General, who has been consulted has agreed not to press for any formal amendments to the rules.

With reference to the orders contained in this department letter No. F.44(II}-W/44. dated the 2Srd August, 1944. (substituted), I am directed to state that the following subsidiary points have been raised in connection with the application of those orders s - (i) According to the last sentence of paragraph 3 of this department letter referred to above, the leave concession can be earned by commutation only in respect of completed years of service. The Govern ment of India have carefully considered whether an officer who has earned one month's commuted leave under these orders should take leave in terms of complete months at a time. Such a restriction would be unnecessary, and it is therefore left to an officer's option to enjoy at a time commuted leave for less than a month. Similarly any period of leave on average pay for less than a month en joyed within the qualifying period will be auto matically adjusted against the credit of commuted war leave. Subject Sir, (ii) A question has also been raised whether, in the case of an officer who takes leave ex India but spends a part of that leave in India, either at the beginning of that leave or after enjoying leave ex India, the period of leave spent in India may be adjusted against the commuted war ^eave earned by the officer. The Government of India have been pleased to decide that such adjustments may also be permitted and that the period of commuted war leave spent by an officer in India between the date of relief and that of sailing shall continue to be shown, for the purpose of the History of Services, as leave out of India. / 2. I am also to state that the Secretary of State has now formally approved of the extension of this commuted leave concession to officers who have been in foreign service and to listed post-holders subject to his rule-making control (vide in this connection, this department letters No. F.44(11).W/44 dated the 9th April, 1945, and 21st April, 1945. ^ I have the honour to be.

Please refer to the correspondence ending with the Govern ment of India, Finance Department's letter No.F«7(15)-E.11/46 dated the 16th September, 1946, regarding the extension of 'War Concession Leave'. p, l / - 2« The object of this concession was presumably to allow officers serving in India an annual break during the hot weather, in which they could visit a hill station and recover from the strain imposed by war cond tions and restriction of home leave; and as far as those officers serving in India are concerned, therefore, it is logical that this leave should, as laid down in the relevant rules, be spent only in India, It has however been pointed out to me that this is far from being the case as far as officers serving in the Persian Gulf are concerned. For the great majority of these oxficers, India is both further and less accessible, owing to the irregularity of the steamer service and the withdrawal of the B.O.A,C, 'C' class service, than parts of Iran or the Arab countries which would be just as suitable for recuperation as the Indian hill stations. 3. I accordingly reco mend that the regtllations governing the grant of this war concessional leave should be broadened to allow of officers stationed in the Persian Gulf spending the leave to which they are entitled in Iraq, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Syria, the Lebanon or Trans Jordan, instead of India, if they so choose. 4. I woula add that, in the ase of the great majority of these officers, leave spent in the Arab countries rather than in India would, owing to the fact that the station to which they are posted is far nearer to B^sra than Karachi, result in a substantial saving to Government in the way of reduced sea fares to the'fixed point'. 5. I should be grateful if the sanction of the Government of India to this proposal could be communicated to me as soon as possible, in order that I may inform my officers in time to allow t^ose concerned to make the necessary arrangements during the coming hot weather. = REPGU = The Issue of the above has been authorised for Secretary to the Political Resident, Persian Gulf.nl No. 619 - 1/6B.

P . a . come under this) and those subject to the ordinary leave rules get an additioijal leave of one .ionth for each coiiipleted year of service beginning on 1-10-42 and ending with 30-9-45. This aduitional leave will be debited to the leave account of the officer as leave on half average pay to the extent of double the period actually tcJ.en on average pay. This leave was to be en.ioyed before the 30th oeptr. 45 uut could be enjoyed later up to 30-9-46, if it w^s appliedf for ^nd refused before 30-9-45. This additional leave could be coiubined with any other leave, but could be taken only in India. P.U.C.25 This' clarifies some of the subsidiary points raised in connection with the application of the orders cited above. 1) ^I'he war concession leave need not necessarily be taken in complete months ct a time i.e. comauted leave for less than a month is also admissible. 2) The part of leave ss -ent.in India by an officer who takes leave ex-India may be adjusted towards the v/otr concession le^ve earned by him. P.U.C.26 Govt, of India have extended the date^o-f admissibility of war. concession leave to 30-9-46 so that those officers who were eligiole for the 3 months 1 leave from Septr. 42 to 50th Lieptr. 45 get an additional one month's war concession leave for the period 1-10-45 to 30-9-46. as before this leave is to be enjoyed normally before 30-9-46 and in case it could not be taken before that date due to exigencies of' service, it could be enjoyed before'30-9-47, and is admissible only in India. In para 2 o^ the p.u.c. the concession has been extei . to officers who have been continuously in service since the 3rd Jeptr. 40 (the original orders noted' in note paras above, were a plicable to officers who have been in service from 3-9-39- only)</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000202_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/987</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000202</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/987</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 1/6B Gazetted Officers: Leave Returns and Rulings'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1923/1948</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2014-01-15T00:02:40</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (215 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in chronological order from the front to the rear of the file.
