Riach asks Elwon to find out who the first aggressor was, and then to proceed to Abothebee [Abu Dhabi] to make further enquiries. The sheikhs were to be reminded that no retaliation to an act of aggression was permitted to any member of the pacified tribes without first referring the matter to the British authorities.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024055009.0x000038#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
