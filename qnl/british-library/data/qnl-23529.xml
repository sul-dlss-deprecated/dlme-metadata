Britisii legation fJulhek July 16, 1933. Ho; Overaeas trade (B) 146. Sir, In oonfiraation of my telegram of July 12th I have the honour to report that on July 6th I received a telegram from His Majesty's Consul at Basra stating that Messrs. Stride had baen reliably informed that the Persian Government were asking for tenders through your Department for two or three oil-burning vessels of 6,000 to 7,000 tons capacity, and inquiring whether I could ascertain details and also whether the Persian government would be interested in the purchase of second hand tonnage. 2. Inquiries made at the Ministry of Roads and Communication and at the Department of Commerce elicited the reply that nothing was known in those departments, but that the Ministry of Finance might be able to give the desired information. A telephone message was later received from the Ministry of Finance saying that the Minister would be pleased to see me on the morning of the 12th instant. 3. This interview took place as arranged, and His Excellency Taghizadeh informed me that the inquiry was a genuine one, and was being pursued in other countries as well as in the United Kingdom. The Persian (Jovernment had not, however, gone into details. They were anxious to have two or three cargo vessels of about the size mentioned, their main object being apparently to show the Persian flag in foreign ports. They would like the ship to be equiped for carrying a certain number of passengers. As they were rather afraid His Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in the Department of Overseas Trade. 1 ^ .afraid of getting the wont of the deal if they bought second hand, they would prefer to buy new ones. If possible they would like to buy ships already completed, but otherwise they would be prepared to place orders for building. 4. His Exceilency said that he would like to have advice of a technical nature before placing the orders or buying ships and I suggested that it might be possible to obtain from your Department the names of two or three impartial JoiijciK® shipiJit. tmimxtsx experts who could furnish the desired information and advice against the ^naval fees. The Minister said that he would be very grateful if this information could be obtained for him, and would like to be informed at the same time approximately how long it would take to build such ships if it were necessary to have them built to order. 5. from the telegram referred to in paragraph 1 above I imagined that Messrs. Strick were i-.iatruote-* in the possible sale of used tonnage to the Persian Government, but it seems else likelv that they as well as other British shipping lines 8 calling at r 'orei.ga ports would be keenly interested in any eventual itate-run and subsidised line competing with them for cargo to and from Europe. It is early to speculate on the possible effect of such competition should it materialise, but if the Persian government are determined to buy ships it is certainly desirable that such orders should be placed in the United Kingdom.

The letter states that the main object of the Persian Government in placing the order was to show the Persian flag in foreign ports. Because they were afraid of getting the worst of the deal if they bought second-hand vessels, their preference was to buy new ones, and they wished to obtain advice from the Department of Trade before placing any orders. It was therefore desirable that any such order should be placed in the United Kingdom.
