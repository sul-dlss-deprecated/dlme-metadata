Ills Highness has requested that ouch j assistance a© is possible nay be given by uo, in order to prove vent the missionaries from carrying out their intentions. Pie richness io strongly opposed to the projoefe a d I gather that his reasons are as follows:- (1) His sanction was not asked. {2) He ha© Just raised a public subscription for the cons truction of a Huekat and lutrah Hospital, and fears that missionary medical work may prejudice the suc cess of hie enterprise. (5) He fears that the mission might gain undue influence among his subjects by medical work and endeavour to convert then from their religion. (&lt;) Ho fears that the missionaries might commence to interfere in administrative natters, ae he has heard they have done in other countries. CD*He fears that If the missionaries were a3.1owed to do medical work in Mutrah, it would be difficult to re fuse them permission to go inland for the same purpose If they went inland trouble might ensue and demands wo would then be made upon him for compensation. 4. The Sultan^ position which is based on administra- tive grounds appears to me to be a reasonable one and I ven ture to recommend that, if the American !Mission appeal to the United States Government, as they ^e^wUAiiiyAvi.ll, in order to enforce their claim, such diplomatic assistance as is possible may be rendered to His Highness in the matter!??' His Majesty’s Government. Article VI of the Muakat treaty with the United States, quoted by the vice Consul, does not appear to apply to the case of missionaries, and although missionaries have of course a right to protection from their Government, it seems only rea 1 sonable that a Hohomedan ruler should decide under what condi tions and within what limits Christian missionaries should be permitted to live and work in his country. Ho other mission is now doing medical work in Huskat. r «- . The Sultan has also informed me that when he told the Reverend Mr Barny of his objections to the enterprise, the lat ter was rude to him, saying that if he had asked for pemissioi to open a liquor shop, Kis Highness would doubtles s have grant eded it Finally, in spite of Hie KighneeB 1 intirsation of hie wlehea and in complete disregard of them the mirsionarios have just concluded a leae© of a houoe in i’utrnh and have made prepara tions for commencing medical work* Action of this eort is greatly to bo deprecated as tending to weaken His Highness* authority over his subjects* I have personally reasoned with Doctor ihorno and endeavoured to per suade him to achieve his end if it can be achieved by more tactful mean® but in vain* He is determined to insiet upon what he consider© to be the undoubted right* of an -jnerican missionary, end to pursue his object in the face of all opposi tion* 6.

The possession of a certain right by one doctor implies the possession of the same right by all doctors, unless the law gives authority to discriminate. As Y* declares that one kind of American doctor is acceptable, I assume that he implies that An. eric an doctors in general are acceptable. The point at issue then is not the right of American doctors to reside and practise in Oman, but the possible dis turbance of the public peace arising from a missionary’s med dling in religious matters. X feel Justified in assuring Y. M, that the United States will not encourage their citizens in meddling, as they will not fail to support them in legitimate activities.

First Assistant Resident, (In charge of Residency). No.3103, dated the 5th December 1909 from First Assistant Resident, In charge of Residency, Bushire, to Foreign, Calcutta. i 2^No. 1257, dated Maskat, the 23rd November 1909. From—R. E. Hoi.la.xd, Esq., Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty's Consuh Maska^, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to refer to your telegram No. 953, dated the 27th September 1909, on the subject of the American Mission Dispensary at Mutra. 2. The American Consul, Mr. J. A. Bay, arrived in Maskat on September pX'' 27th and was received by His Highness the Sultan with his usual courtsey and kindliness. Mr. Bay has had several interviews with His Highness since his arrival, hut he has not, on any occasion, introduced the subject of the American Mission. A few days ago, however, he opened negotiations by forwarding to the Sultan a formal letter in which he requested His Highness to withdraw his objections to the establishment of an American Hospital in Mutra. I enclose a copy of this letter wTdch has been furnished to me by His Highness the Sultan and also a copy of the reply which His Highness has to-day despatched to Mr. Bay. 3. His Highness showed me the draft of his reply before sending it off* but I did not think it necessary or advisable to suggest any change in its form- Saiyid Eaisal is still very unwilling to sanction the establishment of the dispensary and his present intention is to persist in his refusal unless he is forced to give way. As stated in my previous letter, His Highness’s objec tions are partly religious and partly administrative. He fears that the doctor’s successes will result in the conversion of patients, and that the missionaries will then attempt to intervene in administrative matters on behalf of their proteges. He thinks it possible that local disturbances may arise from the missionaries’ interference with their patients’ religion and he fears that, if he gives his sanction to the enterprise, he will render himself responsible to the American Government, in a greater degree than at present, for the protection of the missionaries from the consequences of their actions. 4. I did not advise His Highness to agree to the American Consul’s request, because Mr. Bay’s letter did not seem to me to afford an opportunity for a reasonable settlement at the present stage. On the other hand, I carefully „ refrained on this, as on all previous occasions, from saying anything which might influence His Highness in the opposite direction. The Sultan again asked that the British Government would help him in the matter, and I informed him in reply that I would report the matter to the Besident, but that I could give him no assurance that the British Government would find it possible to support him. 5. In his letter Mr. Bay claims, in the first place, that under the terms of the United States Treaty with Maskat, American citizens have a right to practise medicine in the Sultan’s ports. This claim is, doubtless, valid, especi ally having regard to the fact that British doctors practise regularly in Maskat. In the second place, Mr. Bay claims that an American missionary doctor is on the same footing as any other doctor, and he states that the United States Government have invariably held that missionaries are traders within the senseof the word as employed in treaties. Herein lies the real issue and it will doubtless be considered with reference to precedents which are not at my dis posal. To the layman it seems at least questionable whether a missionary, whose actions are not ordinarily governed by commercial considerations, can be regarded as a trader, and possibly other countries than America have not held that missionaries are traders within the sense of the word as employed in treaties. If missionaries are not traders the American claim on the ground of “ equal opportunity” is untenable in this case, since no other missionary doctor is prac tising or, so far as I am aware, ever has practised in the Sultan’s territories. 6. If His Majesty’s Government find it possible to support the Sultan in this matter and are able to influence the United States Government in the direction required, a favourable opportunity Ifor the withdrawal of the doctor would be afforded in March next, w T hen Dr. Thoms proposes to go on leave to America. If the American Government are unwilling to procure the recall of the doctor, but at the same time wish to avoid unpleasantness with the Sultan, perhaps the matter might be settled by simply leaving things as they are. Dr. Thoms is in possession and can continue his work, whether the Sultan countenances him or not. If circumstances should arise in which he needs the protection of his Government he will doubtless get it, and the formal recognition of his enterprise by the Sultan would hardly strengthen his hands. 7. But possibly the United States Government might consider such a solution undignified, in view of the fact that Mr. Bay has already made uncom promising demands by letter in the name of his Government. I think, personally, that the chance of a reasonable settlement would have been increased if Mr. Bay had discussed the situation personally with His Highness before •writing a letter and he would have found the Sultan quite ready to listen to him. I should have suggested this if Mr. Bay had spoken to me about the matter, but as he did not do so I could not, of course, interfere. 8. I may add that Mr. Bay’s relations with the British community are most cordial, and that he is a pleasant addition to our society. 9. A copy of this letter has been forwarded direct to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Calcutta, in accordance with your general instructions. Dated Maskat, Oman, the 15th November 1909. From—J. A. Ray, Esq., American Consul, To—His Majesty Seyyid Faisul bin Turki, Sultan of Oman. Jfter compliments .—In the course of Your Majesty’s correspondence with Mr. Muhammad Faizel, American Vice and Depuy Consul, relative to the American hospital established at Mutra by Dr. S. J. Thoms, an American citizen, Your Majesty expressed the desire that the matter might he laid before the American Government at Washington. This was done, and I now have the honour to communicate to Your Majesty the reply of the American Government. The Hon’ble Secretary of State of the United States of America has instructed me to inform Your Majesty that the American Government maintains that the right of American citizens to practise medicine in Your Majesty’s dominions is guaranteed by the treaty between Your Majesty’s Government and the United States of America. The portions of the treaty bearing directly on the question are Articles IV and VI, which read as follows:— “ Article IV.—The American citizen shall pay no other duties on export or import, tonnage, license to trade or other charge whatsoever, than the nation the most-favoured shall pay.” u Article VI.—The citizens of the United States resorting to the ports of the Sultan for the purpose of trade shall have leave to land and reside in the said ports without paying any tax or imposition whatever for such liberty other than the general duties on imports which the most-favoured-nation shall pay.”S. o. P. L— 2109 P. 0.-11-124)9- 41 By all rules for the interpretation of treaties the practice of medicine is included in the word “ trade ” as used in these two articles which grant to American citizens the treatment accorded to the most-favoured nation. The only point to determine is whether, as a matter of fact, citizens of any other country are now, or have been in the past since the signing of the treaty, allowed to practise medicine in Your Majesty’s Kingdom. That such is the case admits of no doubt. Tor example, Dr. Norman Scott, a British subject, now resides in Maskat, where he practises medicine and is in charge of a hospital where the subjects of Your Majesty receive treatment. Dr. Scott has even treated patients in Mutra. The British hospital now in course of erection in Maskat has received the hearty approval and support of Your Majesty. Some years ago, Dr. A. S. G. Jayakar, a British subject, retired to Mutra, where he continued to practise medicine until he moved to India, without any objection on the part of Your Majesty so far as I am able to learn. Other examples might be adduced, if necessary. The circumstance that Dr. Thoms is in the employ of an American Missionary Society alters in no wise the aspect of the case. The American Government has invariably held that missionaries are traders within the sense of the word as employed in treaties. Missionaries are entitled to the s ame protection as any other citizens of the United States of America. In the previous correspondence, Your Majesty emphasized the point that you considered a doctor unnecessary in Mutra. The wisdom of Dr. Thoms’ course in establishing a dispensary and hospital in Mutra is not a matter which this Government is at present disposed to discuss, as it is not a question of international law. Under these circumstances, I am instructed to urge Your Majesty to withdraw his objections to the establishment and operation of an Ainerican hospital in Mutra. Translated purport of a letter from His Highness the Sultan of Maskat, to the American Consul, Maskat, dated the 22nd November 1909. j4fter compliments .—Deceived your letter dated the 15th November and understood all that was written in it regarding Dr. S. J. Thoms, the American. The doctor of the British Government is appointed officially by his Adminis tration for the work of a doctor while the American doctor works on behalf of a community of mission and as such interferes with the creed of others. Previous to this I do not remember of any doctor like this, and I am afraid that he will do something which will come in the way of my friendship with the American Government. I would agree if the American Government would accredit him officially for the work of a doctor and would undertake the responsibility that he will not interfere in matters of which we are afraid that it may cause unpleasantness among us. In such a case I may perhaps agree. We have done a lot for the American subjects here and have helped their merchants and our friendship with the American Government has continued.

J 2. Mr. Holland has discussed the question in detail, and it is unnecessary tor me to say much. I agree with Mr. Holland that the whole question turns on whether a missionary can be considered a ‘ trader ’ within the meaning of the word as employed in Treaties. On the legal aspect of this I am not com- Fw 111 u? ex P re J s 1 s ai f opinion, but from a practical point of view I beg to say tnat, although the American missionaries at Bahrein and certain English missionaries regard themselves as traders, this Residency has never been able to regard them as such. It is of course impossible to convince the Sheikh of ■Bahrein (or Koweit) that a missionary whose principal aim in life is religion is on the same footing as a man who sells broadcloth for profit. 3.

Sir, With reference to your despatch No. 211 of September 11th last relative to the opening by the American 'Arabian Mission' of a Dispensary at Mutra, near Muscat, I transmit to Your Excel lency herewith a copy of a letter dated February 19th from the India Office forwarding copy of a despatch from the Government of India showing the course of the negotiations which have lately taken place between the Sultan and the recently appointed United States Consul with regard to this question. lour Excellency will perceive that the United States Govern ment base their demand for the recognition of the dispensary on the ground that they have always held that missionaries are traders in the sense in which that word is employed in treaties, while the Sultan maintains his objections to the enterprise of Dr. Thoms at Mutra. An examination of the sources of information at the disposal of this office does not show that His Majesty f s Government ev^p have ever held missionaries to be traders for treaty purposes and it does not appear to them that they properly belong to that category. The objections, of the nature of which/Your Excellency is already aware, raised by the Sultan to Dr. Thoms' undertaking appear moreover to be reasonable and just from His Highness's point of view and it is desirable on general grounds that His Majesty's Government should uphold the authority of His Highness by supporting him in the attitude which he has adopted. At the same time, the fact that His Majesty's Government have no grounds for official intervention in the matters makestho question of taking steps one. on His Highness’s behalf 6^ a) delioate In view of all the facts I am of opinion that an effort should be made to effect a friendly compromise between the Sultan and the United States Government on the lines laid down in the penultimate paragraph of the India Office letter but as the negotiations with regard to this question have hitherto been carried on by Your Excellency and the Secretary of State of the United States it seems preferable that the suggested verbal explanation should be made by you to him rather than as proposed by me to the United States Ambassador in London. I have accordingly to request Your Excellency to make to Mr. Knox a verbal communication in the sense proposed by the India Office and to explain to him that His Majesty’s Government are in ktak the fullest sympathy with American Missionary enterprise at Muscat but that feeling that Dr. Thoms in opening a dispensary at Mutra in opposition to the Sultan’s wishes is hindering rather than advancing that work, they have thought it right to approach the United States Government with regard to the question.

K. Bennett, who was recently at Koweit, arrived in Maskat towards the end of last month, and has since taken up his residence at Matrah where he is practising medicine and carry ing on the dispensary. 2 1 am informed that Doctor Bennett will probably only stay till the autumn, when he will be relieved by another Doctor coming from Amenca-- whether this will be Dr. Thoms returning from leave or another Doctor I do not know. 3 The mission are still on the look out for a house in Matrah for a hospital, and there is some talk of purchasing a house belonging to the estate of the late Mr. Mackirdy. The house is however right in the town, small and unsuitable in every way, so probably the Mission will not buy it. 4. The Mission is expanding its scope at Maskat, and two lady inissionaries are to come out in the autumn, one of whom will in all probability be a lady doctor. 5.

My dear Clarke, I enoloae a copy of a letter from Trevor, in which he suggests that as the Amerioam Consul and the Italian News Agent have nothing whatever to do in Muscat, it would be convenient if the appointments were dispensed with. Consular Officers in the Gulf with no legitimate worlc to turn their hand to inevitably become troublesome busy- bodies, and this the character of Mr. Hay I thin-i. Mr. Umberto Omar has been harmless enough. I do not fancy H.M*s Government would deem it expedient to offer any hint or advice to either foreign Government con cerned, but there will be no harm in my letting the Govern ment of India know sale what the position is in case any opening should present itself. It is possible that a mere request to the Italian Govern ment for the favour of any recent information they may have regarding the existence of a traffic in arms between Muscat and Somali Land might direct attention to Mr. Umberto Omar and result in his withdrawal.

Wy dear Harrison, 4 You spoke to me the other day about the posnibili- i of your Mission purchasing land for a dispensary or Hospital at Mat-i ra and T promised to look up and see whether my official records gay me any guidance as to what the attitude of our Government would be likely to be on the subject. Ho far I can find nothing to guide me and indeed very little correspondence at all. But it occurs to me — and this please regard as ^ my private opinion subject to any drawbacks that the approaching vio visit of the Resident or subsequent instructions from my Government may impose thereupon — that if T were left alone to advise H.H. in matter, I would urge him to grant you a plot of ground of any reason -able si?;e the Mission might apply for to be selected by H.H., on a nominal quit-rent, say ^:15 per annum. Certain essencial conditions of the lease would be (a) that the Mission had no power to sublet and (b) that the ground was only to be used for medical or religious 1 purposes or for the residence of any members or bona fide y)ermanent servants of the Mission and this on the understanding that no mem ber of the Mission w-hile there residing (1) engaged in trade or j (2) held any official appointment under any Government except that of Oman.(3) that in the event of the ground remaining unused for a ^ period, say three years» from date of grant or,if after being used, it should remain unused or abandoned for the period of one year, the ruler shall be at liberty to terminate the lease and resume posessl' of the ground thUs gra-nted. Possibly,too,your Mission would find ix necessary to stipulate for some method of valuation and purchase of the buildings you erected, should the ruler of Maskat for the tine-i being find it necessary on account of an accidental or non—continu ous breach o£ the conditions (1) and (2) imposed by the lease to tex minate the lease. Of course I dd not know that I have any right to interfere or impose conditions of any kind but,if you think this could go forward as such, I shall be glad to as^ the Resident if ne^ can accord you an interview and place this letter before him when » Yours sincerely signed S.G.Knox, Major. he comes.fcMj Dsar Majoc Knox: Thank you vary muoh for your latter, and for all your trouble in looking up tha matters oonoern- ing Tha Mission’s purchasing land hera in Muttreh.

AKS/jnc.' ' Baghdad, Iraq. December 16, 1930. Major Fowle, British Political Adviser, Muscat, Sultanate of Oman. Sir: I have received today a letter from Miss Sarah L. Hosmon (M.D.), a medical missionary at Muscat in which I am informed that she has been invited to go to the Arabian tqjra of Ristak by the Governor in charge of that town to take care and prescribe for sick people there. Miss Hosmon also informs me that you have re fused to permit her to make this journey unless she first obtains a letter from me permitting her to do so. I have consulted with Dr. Barny of Baghdad who is acquainted with the territories surrounding Muscat and the conditions in those territories. Dr. Barny is of the opinion that Miss Hosmon will run little risk in visiting the town of Ristak, provided of course, that the Governor of that town sends a military escort for her and guarantys her safety. It appears from Miss Eosmon T s statement that the Sultan of~ Oman has consented to her making this journey and she encloses a letter to her from your predecessor, Major Murphy, to the same effect. You will understand that I, being located in a city some hundreds of miles of distant from Muscat, cannot receive definite or adequate information on conditions now prevailing in that territory. If in your opinion conditions have not changed radically for the worse since the date of Major TYirphy T s letter to Miss Hosmon, which was March 21, 1930, I can see no reason to forbid her journey to that town and conse quently request that 3 r ou assist 'iss Hosmon in making her contemplated trip.0 ir' n ' o &lt; ■&lt;.

Memorandum# Please refer to correspondence ending with your telegram No.1033 of 16th December 1930# The case which caused me to send my telegram No.103 of 15th December 1930, was as follows, certain individual Morash bin Belal by name whom the American Missionaries here alleged to be a Christian, but whom / tne local Muslems declared to be a Mohammedan, died, and the vexed question of under what rites he should be buried arose. The Rev. Van Peursem, the American Minister of the Mission, applied to the Council for permission for Merash to be buried as a Christian. The Council advised that he should be buried as a Muslem which was finally done. So far I had not been approached in the matter. The question of Merasl^s widow, one Miryam - a woman of about 27 years of age - then arose. The brother-in-law by all reports a somewhat fanatical and hotheaded individual, claimed that she should perform the adu (x&gt;rescribed mourning) in his house. This means a four months and ten days seclusion in a house for the widow during which she must not see, or even speak to, any man except a relative, it also includes a Muslem ceremony,by a Mulla . The brother-in-law’s claim was supported by the Council. The woman herself in the meantime had gone to the Van Paursem’s house. Mr. Van Peursem, as representing the American Missionaries, then asxed me - as being in charge of American interests - for my good offices on behalf of the widow, pointing out that if she returned to her brother-in-law’s hoiute the latter would undoubtedlyill-treat, and perhaps even kill her. He also pointed out that the performance of the adu would mean the renunciation of her Christian faith. 3. On the other hand the Council - Saiyid Said and Haji Zubair - approached me to assist them in getting the v^idow away from the Van Peursem* s house so that she might perform her adu in the house of her brother-in-law according to custom. The Council was apparently under a vague and mistaken impression that Americans were judicially under the Political Agent like British subjects. The Council denied that the woman was a Christian, and urged that as her husband had been buried as a Muslem his widow should do her mourning according to local Muslem custom. Saiyid Said, not unnaturally from his point of view, apart from the religious aspect of the matter, felt the missionaries’ action as an interference in the affairs of the State? there was no dispute as to the woman being a Muscat subject, whether a Christian or no. 4. The case itself was not perhaps of much moment, but the significance of any dispute depend^ largely on the importance i - r which the parties concerned attach to it, and in the present one the feelings of both the Missionaries and the Council were involved. Mr. and Mrs. Van Peursem felt so strongly on the subject that they delayed their departure on leave to America for some weeks until the case was settled. My position was not an easy one. Both on general grounds, and particularly at the present juncture (when we are asking the United States on behalf of the State for permission to raise the customs tariff) it was obviously most undesirable that there should be any serious clash between Muscat and the local American Missionaries. At the same time it was distinctly undesirable that the Missionaries should be able to say that a ’’Christian' woman had been treated harshly with the tacit approval of a British Consul i.e. myself ? or on the other hand that the Council should receive the impression that I was putting pressure on them on bahalf of the Missionaries.5. I will not weary you with the details of the negotiations in which I assumed the role of a friend of both parties* but I spent a good many hours extending over a number of days interviewing alternately agitated Missionaries and a disgruntled Council* I naturally adopted a sympathetic attitude to each* which was the easier as I was on friendly terms with both. 6. finally being sure of my ground by the result of your telegram quoted above, (though of course I informed neither party of the exchange of our telegrams) I had a final interview (separately) with both sides* I informed the Missionaries that - though I saw their point of view - the charge of American interests ;.hich I hold did not warrant me bringing any pressure to bear on the Council on behalf of a Muscat subject - the widow in question - whether Christian or not, and that ultimate action of the Council must depend on the will of the latter* To the Council - i.e* Saiyid Said, for Haji Zubair merely echoes the latter - I said that while I quite appreciated his feelings on the subject, I was not empowered to force the Americans to give up the woman* But the latter was undoubtedly a Muscat subject whether Christian or no, and that he could do ae he liked in &amp; the matter* But that briefly: every—thing that v as right vas not expedient* That it was most inadvisable at the present juncture when the state was in negotiation with the United States for there to be any incident’^between the State and the American Missionaries, who would doubtless send a report to their headquarters in New York from which it would find its way to Washington* I pointed out that he had not committed himself to any direct, or written order, to the Missionaries to the effect that the woman should undergo her mourning, and that if he finally decided - on grounds of larger policy - not to press the matter, all he had to do was to let the matter drop: and that in a week* s time the incident would be forgotten ( I had ascertained that the case so far had excited little interest in the town)* That in fact it4 . ^12 ®as a case of r^to faire c'est agir. Saiyid Said said he would liice time to consider the matter. 7* I vvas not approached by either party after this, and naturally left well • or what I hoped was **well w - alone. After a couple of weeks I heard that the matter had been settled privately between the Council and the Missionaries by the woman going into ’purdah* for the appointed time in the house of Miss Hosmon - the lady Missionary doctor - and by the woman’s personal property being returned to the brother-in-law. I trust therefore that the case, which caused me some anxiety at the time, and which might have had serious consequences* is finally disposed of. If so it is undoubtedly due to the sensible attitude adopted by Saiyid Said. ' — 8. But though the case is disposed of it will not - in connection with the proposal to raise the customs tariff - make the Council any more ready to grant the United States claim for most favoured nation treatment. (Vide my letter No. 11-C of 13th January 193t para 3.) In fact it is just this tendency on the part of the American Missionaries here (as elsewhere) to interfere (doubtless with humane motiwes) on behalf of their converts, (or alleged converts), and to regard the latter as having in some mysterious way gained peculiar extra-territorial rights, that mainly makes for whatever anti-American feeling and suspicion there ma.y exist in Muscat. *^0 - Maj or, Political Agent &amp; K.B.K’s Consul, r? , Muscat.In reply refer to File No. 811.1 fAKS/jg American Consular Service Baghdad, Iraq, March 10, 1931.

I must apologize for the delay in answering jour communication which was occasioned by the fact that on February 10th I left for a trip to various Gulf ports and hoped also to be able to visit Mascat. However, when I reached Bahrein I could find no means ox pursuing my journey except by utilizing the slow mail and ^consequently coull not afford the necessar' r length of time to journey to your city. . ^ Prior to my.journey to the Gulf I noted the various points.you made in your letter to me and endeavored on my visit to.Bahrein to learn something of the conditions prevailing in Muscat. I am attaching a copy of the letter I wrote to Dr. Hosmon on December 16', 1930, in Wiiich let oer i expressed my ideas on the subiect of her contemplated trip. -.on ..ill note that I have informed Dr. Hosmon that an American consular officer stationed at Baghdad is no u in a position to judge of conditions in Muscat nor to take the responsibility of urging that permission be granted for trips into the interior. Thanking you for your courtesy in writing' me and assuring you of any assistance that this office ca-n give you, I am, Sir, Enclosure: As stated. Alexander E. Sloan,' American Consul.American Consular Service, Baghdad, Iraq, December 16, 1930„ Dr. Sarah Hosmon, Muscat, Oman. Madam: I have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated November 29, 1930, in which you state that upon the^invitation of the Governor of Ristak you desire to visit his town for the purpose of rendering medical aid and assistance to those residing there, but have been informed by the British Political Adviser, Major Fowle, that he will not consent to your making the trip unless you have permission to do so from this office. As you can imagine, I have little or no information concerning present conditions in the Sultanate of Qian. I am av/are of the fact that safety beyond the limits of certain districts in that section is dependent upon con ditions which change so rapidly that only residents of Oman who are very conversant with affairs there can form any judgment concerning the risk involved in making a journey into the interior or in fact to any distance be- yond the town. Under the circumstances I therefore think that Major Fowle should decide the question of your trip to Ristak without consulting me. At the same time I can appreciate his reluctance in the matter* as it has often happened in the past that the killing of an American citi zen or of a British subject bound on an errand of mercy has probably caused more distress than that person could have alleviated. I have consulted Dr. Barny on the matter and while he expresses the opinion that you would run no danger in your contemplated journey, he did not seem too emphatic in his statements to that effect. As you also know the death of Mr. Bilkert has caused all officials concerned to be very cautious in their attitude towards those who journey into possibly dangerous regibns with no thought of self. Consul Randolph in 1922 had the chance of getting ashore at Muscat and of talking to various people in whom he had confidence. I, on the other hand, have no news from Muscat upon which I can form the most hazy idea of what you will have to face in your contemplated journeyMB2 journey. Under the circumstances you will understand, I am sure, that through my ignorance of conditions pre vailing in the Sultanate of Oman at the present time I can not accept responsibility in the matter of your . trip to Ristak. I have written to Major Fowle, telling him that if conditions have not changed for the worse since Major Murphy's letter to you dated March 21, 1930, I can see no reason for his refusing to permit your journey. A copy of this letter is enclosed herewith. I can only assure you that if you are permitted to -make the trip, I wish you a most successful journey and a safe return. Very respectfully yours, Alexander K. Sloan, American Consul.

On the 10th December he sent for Dykstra* to whom he intended speaking his mind in no mixed manner. I have not heard the result of the interview but I advised His Highness to taice a very strong line and I think he required no urging to do so^ His Highness pointed out to me that he could not be responsible for any regrettable incident that might take place if the missionaries wandered about intbls fashion. The Hon’ble ULeut-Colenel T. C. Fewle* C.B.E.* Political Resident in the Persian Gulf* BUSHIER- 2 - I advised him not to mention responsibility to them* as the missionaries* being enthusiasts* might quite well retort that they were prepared to accept the responsibility themselves. The Sultan has ordered his &lt;ali at Dhofar to direct Storm to return forthwith and failing compliance to forcibly embark him. Apparently we have no jurisdiction over the Americans here, who come entirely under His Highness’s authority* so other than reporting the matter to you (as I informed the Sultan I intended doing) I am debarred from taking any further ac ti on. I do not know whether in your capacity as Political Resident, you are vested with powers to deal with them? If so* might I suggest a very stem letter of censure. I fancy His Highness will have a good deal to say to Storm on his return. Yours sincerely,CONFIDENTIAL&gt; D,O.Jlo.939-S of 1932 M y / % • r-r qt /. / 3^~ the residency. 4 v |i|i v Bushire, the 22nd December 1^32. ( ^ V M ^vw&gt;v&lt;a A % Q ( Please refer to your demi-official letter no. C/206 of 13tn December on the subject of Storm’s escapade to Dhofar. Storm is quite a decent sort of fellow, and I’m sorry he has played the fool. I’m glad that the Sultan has taken a strong line, and his communication to Storm should prevent further escapades of a similar nature either on the part of Storm or his confreres. This being so, and the Americans being - as you point out - under the Sultan’s authority and not under ours , I do not propose _ at this stage at all events - to butt in. And on the subject of non-intervention I don’t know whether I ever inflicted the following story on you. A man in a hotel was kept awake by the fellow in the room over his head walking up and down. Having stood it for some time he went up, expostulated with the disturber of his peace, and enquired the cause of his ^ perambulations. 'The fact is' was the reply 'I’m damnably worried. I owe a chap called Smith hundreds and hundreds of pounds.' 'My dear fellow' said the man ' you go to bed. Let Smith do the walking.' So if ever you get a cryptic ^ message from me 'Let Smith do the walking', you’ll know what I mean. When the Storm incident is concluded on his return, or if any developments take place before that, please let me have an official report on the whole case - without referring to this exchange of D.Os. The difficulty about D.O.,corres pond enc e • • • • • Major E.U.C.Bremner ,li.C•, Political Agent, Muscat.&lt;0 - 2 - correspondence (which is very useful in itself) is that often, sooner or later, the subject matter has to be referred officially to higher authority, and there is a convention that D.Os. should not be referred to in official despatches. It is possible that the Americans may raise some sort of protest to you on the Sultan's orders limiting their move ments. If they do so give them a non-committal reply, and say that you are referring the matter to me. The matter will have to be carefully handled. “T'. c.\ TTTTaM .D &lt;/ (^)YERNMENT OF INDIA, Department, L^A F S LETTER [A 7 .

(w) C/544-1, a/7. Dated 24 th May IS %.- Dr.n.H.Stora. I gather from the local Missionaries that Lr. Stora is returning to the Persian Gulf 'in the fall'. Dr. Stona is to relieve hr.lame, when he goes on leave in April 1935, but in the meantime is to return to Muscat, where he will be one above the usual number of missionaries and will spend his time 'on tour'. 2. I believe that there was trouble over £r. Storm going off to Dhufar without permission from His Highness the Sultan and it is undesirable that he should use Bahrain as a base for similar escapades. 3. I have seen Dr. Storm casually and was not favourably impressed, but do not know enough about him to judge whether he is likely to be harmful politically in this post. If your fuller knowledge of him and his doings suggests that he might be harmful, it might be expedient to /inform s. e. MFP—.785S&amp;P—(M-1014)—18-S-33 - 2,00,000.
