Followed by British efforts to prevent the Al Ali tribe from relocating to the Arabian Coast, and settling in the region of Demaun [Ad-Dammān] that same year; the Al Ali tribe was viewed as a threat by the rulers of Bahrain.Also included in the file is correspondence relating to the replacement of the Treaty of Maritime Truce 1843 with the Perpetual Treaty of Maritime Peace 1853, which was signed between Britain and the Shaikhs of the Arabian Peninsula. This includes the Resident's resolution of a crisis caused by a discrepancy in the English and Arabic expiry dates of the 1843 treaty, which had meant that not all parties were working to the same timetable. In relation to this topic, the issues Shaikh Sulṭān bin Saqr has with a ruling of the East India Company Court of Directors — indicating that compensation payments for violations of the Maritime Truce should be paid directly to injured parties without reference to their ruler — are also covered.A dispute between Syed Saeed [Sa‘īd bin Sultān Āl Sa‘īd], the Imam of Muscat, and Tahmesp Meerza, the Prince Governor of Fars Province, over Bandar-e ʻAbbās is another issue discussed in the file; a Persian force marched against the settlement in 1854. The main point of concern being the Imam's desire to recruit assistance from Bahrain, and Basra to support his claim over the town, which the British feared could lead to the disruption of maritime peace in the Persian Gulf.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Shaikh of Demaun</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Wāli of Egypt and Sudan</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Chargé d'Affaires to Iran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Amir Faisal bin Turki bin Abdullah Āl Sa'ūd</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Batinah Coast</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Bunder Abbas </geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Demaum</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Karrack (island)</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Treaty of Maritime Peace in Perpetuity (1853)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Treaty of Maritime Peace (1843-1853)</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000069#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
