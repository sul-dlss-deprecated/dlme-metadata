I am directed to refer to letter No.2Y2~f).A., dated the 9th September 1917, from the foreign and Political Department to your address, on the subject of the construction of a platform for stacking coal at Henjam. 2. The platform authorised by the Government of India consists of a bed of flat stones laid on sand with dry concrete over it. A committee of officers who recently visited Henjam reported that the surface of the platform was so soft that it was no improvement on the original unprepared surface. They accordingly proposed that a flooring of dressed stone should be laid on the present surface, the interestices being cemented or mortered. It is, hov/ever, considered by Mr. Aitkin (Bngineer, Public Works Departs* ment) that the dressed stone available on the island is too soft to stand the weather and he therefore strongly advises concrete. 3. I am now to convey the sanction of the Government of India to the above proposal, and to request that, with the permission of His Excellency the Governor in Council, instructions may be issued to the local representative of the Public Yforks Department to carry out the work as early as possible.

Note 5.—The period for which a temporary appointment or deputation has been sanctioned by the Secretary of State may, if necessary, be extended without further reference to that authority, provided that such extension shall not exceed one month. Note 3. —When the remuneration of an officer appointed to a temporary appointment or placed on deputation for a period of more than two years is increased beyond the limit of Rs. 800 a month laid down in this clause, by reason only of an increase of the pay or acting allowance of the officer holding it, the specific sanction of the Secretary of State will not be required to the continuance of the temporary appointment or deputation with increased remuneration until the expiry of the period originally sanctioned.

The fee paid to an educational officer selected as an examiner on purely personal grounds, irrespective of his position under Government, though these grounds may bring about his appointment in successive years, is not a recurring fee within the meaning of this rule. Note 2. —Pensioned officers of Government rank as private persons in respect of the receipt of honoraria from general revenues, from local funds, or from the revenues of a Native State.

Provided that in the case of railways they may (1) at any time when the Budget is being prepared in March sanction an addition not exceeding the amount of the anticipated lapse in the sanctioned grant for the expiring year, to the railway programme of the ensuing year, as sanctioned by the Secret ary of State'm Council ; and (2) they may, when the actual amount of the lapse is known, sanction an addition to the programme, or an increase to any addition already made under provision ( 1 ), not exceeding any amount by which the actual lapse in the grant for the previous year may have been greater than the lapse that was anticipated when the final revised estimates of that year were framed. All such regrants will be subject to the following condi tions, (a) that the total amount of any regrant made under provision (1) or provision (2), or under provisions (1) and (2) combined, in respect of any one year shall not exceed Rs. 50 lakhs ; (b) that if the actual lapse in the grant of the previous year prove to be less than the regrant sanctioned under provision (1), that regrant shall be reduced accordingly ; and (c) that no regrant shall' be made unless it can be provided for without disturbance of the Ways and Means pro gramme. Note 2. In the event of an excess occurring in the expenditure of any year over the sanctioned grant of that year, the programme of the following year as sanctioned by theSecret- arv of State must ordinarily be reduced by the amount of such excess unless the sanction of the Secretary of State in Council to the contrary course is obtained. The Government of India may, however, on their own authority, waive such reduction if that course does not involve an alteration of the Ways and Means programme of the year, as shown in the Budget, by more than £250,000.

(2) All new measures involving expenditure chargeable to heads Army, Marine, Military Works, or Special Defences, the total initial cost of which, 'plus one year’s recucring expenditure, is estimated to exceed Rs. 50,000, shall be submitted to the Secretary of State in an annual schedule. (3) Expenditure on such measures shall not be incurred (a) in the case of measures which are beyond the powers of the Government of India as defined in the foregoing sections of this resolution, until the specific sanction of the Secretary of State in Council has been received ; (b) in the case of measures which are within the powers of the Government of India as defined in the foregoing sections of this resolution, until the measures have been submitted to the Secretary of State in an annual schedule. As an exception to this rule, expenditure of the kind referred to in case (6) may be incurred without previous reference to the Secretary of State, and in anticipation of its inclusion in the next annual schedule, provided that it can be met from savings or lapses in the sanctioned schedule allotment of the year. When expenditure is so incurred, a report should be made to the Secretary of State. (4) Except with the previous sanction of the Secretary of State in Council the total expenditure on schedule measures in any year shall not exceed the total sum allotted for such measures in the budget of the year. (5) When the estimate for the construction of a work specified in clause (1) of this rule has been sanctioned by the Secretary of State in Council the Government of India can ordinarily sanction outlay in excess -n * w o . , cu .

Note.—Subject to compliance with the requirements of clause (2) above, the Government of India may vary the allocation of the total schedule allotment of the year between the different measures included in the schedule without reference to the Secretary of State, or may apply a portion of the total allotment to the prosecution of measures which*are included in the schedule, but for which no actual provision has been made.

N 0 te 1. In any case where a cash grant would be within the powers of sanction of the Government of India, the grant of a loan of an amount not exceeding that of the cash grant, does not require the sanction of the Secretary of State in Council. Note 2. Loans and advances of the various classes described in Chapter 8 of the Civil Account Code, which have hitherto been sanctioned by the Government of India without reference to the Secretary of State, are not of an unusual nature within the meaning of clause (1) (a) of this rule. IX. The Auditor-General, of his own motion or on reference being made to him by the Government of India, may review the audit decision of any subordinate Audit Officer on any point, and may, if he considers it to be incorrect, overrule it. The Auditor-General may dispense with a reference to the Secretary of State, otherwise required by these rules, in Despatch from the Secretary of State, No. 60 cer f a i n cases where the expenditure in- (Financial), dated the 5t i ay . volved has been small in itself or in com parison with the spending powers of the Government of India in directions of a similar character, and the failure to obtain the Secretary of State’s sanction has involved a breach of the letter rather than the spirit of the Audit Resolution. The local Governments and certain other administrative authorities have certain powers in regard to the remission Article 279-A., Civil Account Cone. 0 | disallowances by Audit Officers so far as they affect payments made more than six months before the date when they were challenged ; and more restricted powers of remitting disallowances of pay ments made within six months from the date of payment.

With reference to the correspondence ending with your letterj No. 138-E.A., of the 24th July 1916, I am directed to for- iSerial No. 6. ward herewith revised plans and estimates for constructing a coaling pier at Hen jam in the Persian Gulf together with copy of letter No. C.- 8 , of 10 th March 1916, from the Chief Engineer in Sind and its accom paniments. The Chief Engineer’s letter furnishes a full report dealing with the remarks contained in the letter from, the Government of India, No. 272-E.A., of 15th June 1915. In his letter No. 6382, dated 4th August 1916 (copy appended), the Director, Royal Indian Marine, states that he considers that a pier such as that suggested would meet all requirements and that coal wagons will be provided by the Marine Department. 2 . With reference to the delay which has occurred in the submission of the plans and estimates, I am to explain that the preparation of rough plans and estimates was delayed because of the boring necessary to ascertain the nature of the soil. The boring apparatus had to be obtained from the Indus River Commission, and as it was out of repair it had to be overhauled before work could be commenced. The fair plans and estimates were received from the Chief Engineer in Sind in March last and were at once passed on to the Direcor of the Royal Indian Marine who, though four times reminded, did not return them till the 5th instant. His explanation is given in his letter referred to above. 3 . The plans and estimates amount to Rs. 68,731, inclusive of charges on account of establishment and tools and plant, but the Accountant-General, Bombay, reports, in his No. 4029, of 11 th August 1916 (copy appended), that it is not necessary to make provision for establishment charges as the cost of the work is chargeable to Imperial Eunds and as it will be carried out by an Imperial Establishment. Provision for tools and plant at li per cent, is, however, necessary as the tools and plant of the Karachi Buildings District, under whose jurisdiction the work is are classified as Provincial. I am accordingly to request that the Government of India may be moved to sanction the plans and estimates for Rs. 57,242 as detailed below and allot funds to this extent:— ( 1 ) Pier (works) Tools and Plant (@ 1| %) Shipping, freight, landing and customs charges (2) Double rail track (works) Tools and Plant (@ 1-| %) Shipping, freight, landing and customs charges .. Grand total Rs. 48,955 735 2,700 52,390 4,485 67 300 4,852 57,242 C486FD■ wm+mamm 4 . With reference to paragraph 15 of the Chief Engineer’s letter this Govern ment recommends the proposal therein made for the favourable consideration of the Government of India. 5. The original plans and estimates accompany. Enclosure 1 of Serial No. (21). No. C .-8 of 1916, dated Camp, the 10 th March 1916. From—F. St. J. Gebeie, Esq., Chief Engineer in Sind, To—The Joint Secretary to Government, Public Works Department, Bombay. With reference to the correspondence ending with my No. C-7, dated 10 th February 1916, I have the honour to forward, for disposal, revised plans- and esti mates, the latter amounting to Rs. 68,731 as detailed below, for constructing a coaling pier at Hen jam in the Persian Gulf :— Us. ( 1 ) Pier (works) .. .. .. *. . - 48,955 Establistment and Tools and Plant at 23% .. .. 11,260 Shipping, freight, landing and customs charges .. .. 2,700 Total (2) Double rail track (works) Establishment and Tools and Plant charges at 23% Shipping, freight, landing and customs charges .. Total Grand Total 62,915 4,485 1,031 300 5,816 £ 0 68,731 2 . All the remarks contained in the Government of India’s letter No. 272-E.A., dated 15th June 1915, have been duly attended to and a full report dealing with them is given below. 3 . The-site of the pier shown in the site plan (sheet No. 1 ) was suggested by His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief, in his No. 880-TV, dated 23rd March 1913, to the address of the Director, Royal Indian Marine, referred to in Government of India’s No. 953 of 18th February 1914. The proposed pier is located close to an old loose stone pier commenced and abandoned some years ago. The site is a sheltered spot and the sea is not liable to be rough. I attach herewith copies of the correspondence, from which it will appear that the site is approved and no better site exists. 4 . Four borings to a depth of 15 feet below.sea bed have been made along the proposed line for the pier and one trial pit for the abutment. These borings are shown in the elevation of the pier on sheet No. 2 . The sea bed consists of 4 to 5 feet sand and gravel overlying soft rock. 5 . The floor level of the pier as now proposed is 4-71 feet above H. AV. L. This amount of free-board is considered as suitable by the Naval authorities. 6 . The length of the pier is 321 feet to secure a minimum depth of 4 feet, 30 feet from the end of the pier, to enable lighters to he alongside at low water. 7. The pier is proposed to be an entirely steel structure with a masonry abut ment at the shore end, foundations of the latter resting on rock. The masonry approach provided in the original design has been done away with as local stone will not stand wave wash, and to import good stone from another place, such as Quoin Islands, would be very costly. 8 . As no expert staff exists in the locality for making and driving reinforced concrete piles, screw steel piles have been provided instead. They will be 5 inch in diameter and will go down 10 feet below the sea bed. It will not be difficult to screw them into the soft rock.9 . Calculations for pressure at the bottom of screw piles, strength of steel piles, rolled steel girders and joists and jarrah wood floor, and also diagrams of the stability of the masonry abutment and wings are attached. 10 . The pier is provided with cross bracings longitudinally as well as trans versely. 11 . A stair-case has been provided outside the sixth bay from the head, for the use of row boats and passengers. This form of stair-case is considered better and safer than one set in the body of the pier. 12 . The piles, their spacing, form of bracings and stair-case as now proposed are reported by the Executive Engineer, Karachi Buildings District, to be similar to those adopted in the recently constructed pier at Itewas bunder in the Kolaba District. 13. The establishment and tools and plant charges have been amended in accordance with paragraph 4 of the Government of ludia’s letter. 14. A separate estimate amounting to Bs. 5,816 is attached, providing for a double trolly track of rails to enable empty and full waggons to pass for facilitat ing coaling operations. The lighters will probably lie on both sides of the pier and a double track will therefore be necessary. No provision has been made in the estimate for waggons, as they can be provided by the Marine Department. 15. Further to facilitate the coaling operations, it may be necessary to have a crane for lifting coal from the lighters. If approved by Government one will be provided in construction. 16. The estimated cost of the revised design is Rs. 68,731 and that of the original design was Rs. 26,837, the increase being due to the following reasons (а) The pier now proposed is a steel structure for the whole length. In the original design it consisted partly of a stone masonry approach and partly of a steel pier. ( б ) Solid steel piles are provided instead of reinforced concrete piles. (c) The floor level is higher than in the former design. (d) A double trolly rail track is provided. This provision was not made in the original estimate. (e) The rates provided are higher than those in the original estimate, owing to war. 17. The original plans and estimates accompany. Sub-Enclosure 1 of Enclosure to Serial No. ( 21 ). Letter No. 1009, dated the 12th February 1916. From—The Executive Engineer, Karachi Buildings, To—The Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf. I have the honour to forward herewith a site plan for the proposed coaling pier at Henjam. Mr. Storrs, in his report on the pier, stateu that when the original plans and estimate were returned by the Government of India as being too elabo rate and costly, a meeting was held at Henjam in April 1914 between the Senior Naval Officer and Mr. Homer, Assistant Engineer, and certain proposals for reducing the cost were decided as also the position of the pier, its length, depth of water, etc. 2 . The Government of India have remarked on the proposed site that it is presumed that no better site exists. 3 . As this site was chosen and is a sheltered spot (the position of the proposed pier is located as shown on the plan near an existing abandoned stone pier), I think there is no other more suitable site. 4 . I should be obliged by your informing me at an early date whether the pre sumption of the Government of India is correct and, if so, the accompanying site plan may please be returned signed in token of your approval of the site.Sub-Enclosure 2 of Serial No. (21).

Coal waggons will be provided by this Department. The delay is returning the file is due to its having been misplaced when the Record and other Sections of this office were removed to new quarters, and is regretted. The estimates appear to be in order and may, if approved, be submitted to the Government of India for sanction. 2. It is not necessary to make provision for Establishment Charges in this case, as the cost of the work is chargeable to Imperial funds and will be carried out by an Imperial Establishment, but as the Tools and Plant of the district is classified as Provincialal, a charge of 1| per cent for Tools and Plant should be provided for, as required by Public Works Department Code, Volume II, paragraph 1885, Rules IV and IX.w lent Ei.

All three of these points have, I submit, been settled in principle and agreed to by Government of India, but nothing has been done as regards the pier, which is urgently needed. 11 The power of the wireless telegraph station appears to have been brought under discussion again after being settled by my'concurrence with your telegram No. 35, of 8th February 1916. The building for the coal conductor and staff, which the Government of | India stated, in July 1912 (February 1913?) would be undertaken at the samel time as the wireless telegraph station, has not been commenced at all. Sub-Enclosure 2 of Enclosure to Serial No. 3. Henjam* Coaling Pier. No. 213 of 11th July 1912. —Commander-in-Chief to Government of India saying it is desirable to build a pier and that building of said pier should be deferred for the present and carried out as part of the wireless telegraph project. 2. 1201-9-M., of 5th February 1913. —Government of India stated that Public Works Department would build pier at same time as wireless telegraph station and asked for estimates. 3. Telegram No. 5 of 18th February 1913. —Commander-m-Chief to Govern ment of India concurring with (2) provided work was taken in hand as soon as possible. 4. No. C.-5a-13 of 16th March 1913. —Letter from Senior Naval Officer, Per sian Gulf, to Commander-in-Chief suggesting a pier on east side and a light pier on west side. No. 880 IV of 23rd March 1913. —From Commander-in-Chief to Director, Royal Indian Marine, calling for plans and estimates for permanent pier on east side. 6 to 11. Various letters from various Senior Naval Officers from 20th June 1913 to 29th December 1914 making various suggestions. Matters then appeared to hang fire except for various reports to Commander-in-Chief and to Director, Royal Indian Marine, to which there appear to have been no replies. 12. 1009 of 12th February 1916. —From Executive Engineer, Karachi, to Commodore, Persian Gulf, very urgent, forwarding proposed plan and requesting approval. This was approved by Commodore on 26th February 1916 by telegram and letter in accordance with (5) Commodore’s action being later approved by Commander-in-Chief’s minute No. 880 of 29th March 1916. Nothing more appears to have been done since and “ Britomart ” reported to Commodore on 9th March 1916 that the wireless telegraph buildings were well advanced but that no steps had been taken as regards the pier, vide (2). On the 18th March 1916 a telegram was sent by the Commodore to the Executive Engineer, Karachi, asking what steps had been taken to commence the pier On 23rd March 1916 a reply was received from the Executive Engineer saving that plans and estimates and a copy of the Commodore s approval had heen sent to the Government of India for disposal and saying that work could not be commenced until sanction had been received. This last is not understood as it would appear that the Government of India’s approval was given on 6th February 1913, vide paragraph 2.4 Sub-Enclosure 3 of Enclosure to Serial No. 3. Erection of Wireless Telegraph Station at Hen jam. Letter from “ MozafEer,” dated 1st April 1916, states that buildings will be completed 31st May 1916, that the proposed power of wireless^telegraph set is at resent unknown and that this question is still under discussion viz., whether to Jask a high power station and Henjam a low power station or vice versa, or to make do away with Jask altogther : that the wireless telegraph set is still at Karachi and that no news had been received at Henjam as to when it would arrive.” With reference to the above, telegram No. 35 of 8th February 1916 from Commander-in-Chief to Commodore, states that Government of India asks if he concurs in the following proposals “ whether a three kilowatt station at Henjam will meet all probable requirements. Also, that on the completion of Henjam wireless telegraph station, whether Jask wireless telegraph station should be dismantled as being obsolete.” Commodore replied by telegram No. 47 of 8th February 1916 and by letter No. 022-49 of 13th February 1916 ns follows : “ These arrangements, when complete should meet all requirements, but Jask Radio should not be dismantled until Henjam is completed.” It is understood that this concurrence settled the matter finally, but if “ Mozafier’s ” report is correct it would appear that the question has been re opened. Sub-Enclosure 4 of Enclosure to Serial No. 3. Buildings for Conductor in charge. No. 213 of 11th July 1912, paragraph 4 from Commander-in-Chief to the Gov ernment of India stated that suitable buildings would be provided and would be built at the same time as the quarters for the wireless telegraph staff. Commodore's letter No. 70 of 20th February 1916 to the Director, Royal Indian Marine, contained a letter from the coal conductor of 8th February 1916, in which he stated there were no quarters for the conductor and staff at the depot and that at present he and his staff had to live in a 160 lb. tent. Director, Royal Indian Marine, replied on 9th March 1916 that the matter had been referred to the Government of Bombay, Public Works Department. Letter from “ Mozaffer,” dated 1st April 1916 says the question of accommo dation for the coal conductor is still under discussion and that the coal conductor is at present living in the telegraph buildings. I understand that it is practi cally impossible to live in a tent during the hot season. (4) Telegram No. 175-E.A., dated the 18th July 1916.

Sir, The Director of the Royal Indian Marine brings to notice that the Military Guard of 7 men at Kenjam patrol at night only around the Telegraph Buildings and is said to be in charge of the Telegraph Department. The Military Guard was originally at Basidu and was transferred to Henjam primarily to look after the coal stacks which are lying open and which the Director Royal Indian Marine considers should be watched. 2. The Director, Persian Gulf Section of the Indo European Telegraph Department has no objection to the guard at Henjam keeping a watch around the coal stacks if the cable station at Henjam is sufficiently protected. 3. If the course suggested is not feasible I am to request that you will take the necessary action, in consultation with His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to increase the guard at Henjam in order to ensure a watch being kept on the coal stacks. I have, etc., Sd.

Sir, I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of letter No. 900-D., dated 2nd March 1916 from the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, on the subject of the Military Guard at Henjam. 2. In reply I beg to state that the Director, Royal Indian Marine, is right in saying that the Military Guard was originally appointed to look after the coal depot at Henjam on its transfer to that place from Basidu. 3. It will however be within the recollection of the Government of India that in April 191b the Director, Royal Indian Marine suggested that the coaling depot at Henjam should be virtually abolished and the coal (except 20 tons), the Conductor in charge and all the establishment except a watchman should oe sent to Basrah** (vide correspondence forwarded with Foreign and Political Dep- artment end or s ement No. 266-E. A., dat ed 9 th June 191b). 4. The coal depot thus requiring no guard, the ordinary course would have been to suggest its withdraw al, but in June a disturbance occurred in Qishm, and somesome armed strangers were reported to have been seen in Henjam. The position of the Telegraph clerks seemed to be insecure, and so with the knowledge of the Officer Commanding Jask from whose detachment the guard was i supplied, the Telegraph Buildings were placed in the charge of the guard. It was in this way that the giard was diverted from the charge of the Coal depot to that of the Telegraph Buildings. 0. I have made enquiry and find that the guard cannot efficiently look after both the Telegraph Buildings and the Coal depot which are some distance apart. I will therefore, take steps to got tne guaro. iiiCieaoed as suggested in paragraph 5 of the letter under reply.

Biscoe, Assistant Resident and His Majesty's Consul Bandar Abbas, J ’ To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. 1 have the honour to solicit a reference to your telegram No. 38 of the 10th January 1914 on the subject of the refusal of certain relatives of the Shaikh of Henjam to pay Customs duty for goods imported by them from Bombay by mail steamer. 2. As you are aware, the village of Henjam is situated on the south side of the island, while the Customs mudir lives on sufferance on the north side in the immediate vicinity of the Telegraph Office. The inhabitants of the village have consistently refused up to the present to pay Customs duty, and the Persian Government has never been able to compel them to do so. As the villagers usually import such few necessities of life as they require from Dibai, Lingah or elsewhere in sailing boats and land them at the village, no demand is made by the Customs department. On the present occasion, however, it appears that some relatives of the Shaikh imported some goods by mail steamer from Bombay, which goods were manifested in the ordinary way, and landed on the north side of the island in front of the Customs house. The mudir naturally demanded duty which the relatives of the Shaikh declined to pay, and in their refusal they were supported by the Shaikh, who addressed a letter to the Clerk in Charge, Henjam, informing him of the incident and his intentions with regard to it. &amp; 3. The Clerk in Charge telegraphed to me as follows Relatives of Shaikh of Henjam who freighted miscellaneous goods from Bombay positively refuse to pay Customs dues and the Shaikh has written telling me that he refuses to admit of dues and means to uphold his relations’ stubbornness. I have not replied to Shaikh but I think the men should pay Customs as the consignment has been lying at the Customs house a week ”. On receipt of this communication it appeared to me desirable that the Shaikh should e given a strong hint that it^would be advisable to yield in the present instance: the Customs department obviously had right on their side, and I was of opinion that it would be to the interests of all concerned that the question should not be raised in an acute form: hence I put forward a suggestion to this effect to from tb^ 0 ri eV ^ r,0n rvl^ ^ t ^ ie f°^ ow i n g telegram awaiting me from the Clerk in Charge Mudir of Customs has at last released the goods and promises not to tax the latter s importations in future and I am pleased to report that a cordial feeling now exists between them ”. tnrllv 4 * P resent appears therefore to have been settled satisfac- ^ , haV f e as , ked ^ he Clerk in Charge to submit a detailed report of the mnir T P^?^^ to endeavour to ascertain whether the Customs Randnr ^^ ° 13 accord or un der instructions from his superior at followino- week* ex P ec l ; ^e r eport by next mail, and will transmit it to you the 1 No. 47 , dated the 20 th January 1914 .

Lang, Clerk in Charge, Henjam, To— CAPTAIN H. V. BlSCOE, Assistant Resident and His Majesty’s Consul, Bandar Abbas. From my previous messages you will know how the estrangement arose between the mudir of Customs and the Shaikh of Henjam and I have nothing further to mention unless it be that a satisfactory arrangement was arrived at on the day Mr. Gunter, our Director, visited the station, and as this matter was mentioned to him, l was asked to make an effort to get the parties to come to some understanding, but at the same time Mr. Gunter mentioned that he had nothing to do with it. On my part I made both the Shaikh and mudir clearly understand that as far as 1 was concerned it would be agreeable to know that they have arrived at something definite, and that since neither party bore the other an ill-feeling, that there should be no difficulty in favouring the Shaikh, whose goods had been in the Customs since the 26th ultimo by releasing them. To my pleasant suprise I was informed that the mudir wished to release the goods and hand them over to the Shaikh and I know the latter, in consideration, gave the mudir 10 krans as a token of gratitude, and that they both parted the best of friends and on the understanding that the Shaikh's goods would not in future be taxed and in no way would the Shaikh be harassed. 1 hope you will be pleased to learn of the good feeling. No. 173 , dated 5 th March 1914 . From— Captain H. V. BlSCOE, His Majesty’s Consul, Bandar Abbas, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. 1 have the honour to solicit a reference to the correspondence ending with my letter No. 47 of the 20th January 1914, regarding the refusal of the Shaikh ol Henjam to pay Customs duties. I had hoped that this question had been finally settled to the satisfaction of all concerned for some time to come: I regret to report, however, that it has again been revived in an acute form. The Shaikh of Henjam, abandoning, it w r ould seem, the rice of his forefathers, which he used to obtain from Dibai and land at his village without any demands on the part of the Customs Department, has acquired a taste for the more varied comestibles obtainable in Bombay. These he imports by British India steamer, and they are landed in the ordinary course at the Customs house at Henjam. On the previous occasion reported to you the question of Customs duty was settled by the payment of a small sum to the Customs mudir and it was apparently understood that no further demands would be made by the latter for duty on goods imported by the Shaikh. Now however the Shaikh has imported a further consignment on which the mudir demands Customs duty amounting to Rs. 60 or Rs. 70. This the Shaikh refuses absolutely to pay, and he has addressed a letter to the Clerk in Charge, Henjam, to this effect. There are two possible explanations of the mudir’s attitude: firstly the Director of Customs recently paid a surprise visit to Henjam and, it is said, discovered a good many irregularities in the mudir’s accounts ; this may make him unwilling to make further concessions to the Shaikh. Or, secondly, it is possible that he may expect a “ commission ” on each consigrttnent of the Shaikh’s, whereas the latter is only willing to pay once and for all. However this may be, there is I think no occasion for us to give any reply to the Shaikh at present, and if allowed to drag on, the affair will probably settle itself. 1 have, however, thought it advisable to inform you of the facts of the matter, in case it should be necessary to ask for your orders by telegram. In the event of it becoming necessary for us to give a reply to the Shaikh, I would suggest that he should be told that as long as he lands goods in front of his own house the Customs do not interfere with him, but that it is asking too much of the Customs to expect them to waive duty in the case of goods landed in front of the Customs House, and that he cannot look for any support from us in the matter.- No. 15 -C., dated 5 th March 1914. From—CAPTAIN H. V. Biscoe, His Majesty’s Consul, Bandar Abbas, To—M ajor S. G. Knox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to inform you that Monsieur Fourman, Director of Customs here, recently visited Henjam, and 1 have received the following report re^ardinc his visit from the Clerk in Charge, Henjam. He writes, just a line to let you know the Director of Persian Customs at Bandar Abbas who &lt; recently visited Henjam mentioned to me that he proposed erecting a stone building here on the site now occupied by the Customs mudir and, when it was ready, to send a Belgian official here to relieve the present man who had apparently not come up to the standard required of him. The Director was however careful to avoid mentioning the Belgian’s name.” As the latter part of the report cannot be correct, t am not disposed to give much credence to the former either, but submit it to you for what it is worth. It is possible, that Monsieur Fourman might be contemplating the transfer of a Dutch Customs employe by name Pater from Chahbarto Henjam, but I do not consider this very probable. I have not seen Monsieur Fourman since his return from his tour but expect to do so shortly, and will then endeavour to obtain some further information regarding his intentions. No. 16 -C., dated 10 th March 1914 . From—C aptain H. V. Biscoe, His Majesty’s Consul, Bandar Abbas, To—M ajor S. G. Knox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. In continuation of my letter No. 15-C., dated 5th March 1914, regarding the visit of the Director of Customs to Henjam, I have the honour to state that I have since received a visit from Monsieur Fourman in the course of which he dis cussed the whole matter with me. He said that since the mail steamers had started calling at Henjam many merchants of Qishm who import goods from India had taken to having their merchandise consigned to Henjam instead of to Bandar Abbas, though the latter place is nearer to Qishm, “ because as they themselves remarked the Customs duty levied at Henjam was less than at Bandar Abbas. In other words they can bribe the Customs mudir more easily than they can the Customs officials at Bandar Abbas. Monsieur Fourman told me that he was there when a mail steamer arrived and w r as present at the verification of the goods landed from the steamer, and on that one shipment alone the Customs dues came to tumans 103, about £20. There was no reason to suppose that this shipment was abnormal, but the receipts were much above the average receipts shown in the mudir’s accounts, and it was evident therefore that a good deal of smuggling had been taking place. I may mention also that passengers for Qishm frequently disembark at Henjam in order to avoid quarantine; the ship is usually out of quarantine when it gets to Henjam, and in any case there is no means of enforcing quarantine there. The Director of Customs stated that the mudir inhabited a miserable one-roomed hut and that there were no arrange ments at all for storing merchandise etc. Up till recently there had of course been no need for any Customs buildings since no steamers called there, but now that the British India mail steamers had made it a regular port of call and comparatively large quantities of goods were being disembarked there, it was very desirable that there should be some sort of a structure there where goods could, be stored until cleared through the Customs. He was about to submit a report on the subject to Tehran, and was going to propose the construction of a small three-roomed mud-building. He emphasised that he had no desire to interfere in any way with our arrangements, either m connection with the coal dep6t or the telegraph, and as he understood that a portion of the island was a British concession the Central Customs Administra tion would of course have to obtain the consent of His Majesty’s Government -He further said that the present mudir would have to be transferred as a Pj* rt from the irregularities in his accounts, he could not read English and was unabe to translate manifests received from the ships ; he was anxious to send a man there who knew a little English, but had no one available at present. He adde DO! ere( onij nar tba jyir Fot5 that the clerk in charge of the telegraph station at Henjam seemed to be afraid that he intended building a large edifice in front of the telegraph office; he had no such intention as firstly, the Persian Government were not in the habit of erecting pretentious buildings, and secondly, there was no need for it; he was only going to piopose the construction of a building of the most modest dimensions. Finally Monsieur Fourman mentioned the question of the payment of Cus toms duty by the Shaikh of Henjam ; he said he had no wish to annoy the Shaikh over a comparatively trivial matter and as long as he was satisfied that the Shaikh was only importing goods for the use of himself and his own personal followers, he was quite willing to waive Customs duty. He had been led to believe, however, that other persons had been importing goods in the Shaikh’s name in order to evade duty, d he Clerk in Charge, Henjam, also seems to think that there is some ground for this suspicion. There is a consignment of goods lying at Henjam at the present moment regarding which a dispute is in progress between the Customs mudir and the Shaikh ; I am, however, going to see Monsieur Fourman tomorrow and will endeavour informally to effect a solution of the matter. His attitude in the matter is certainly a most Reasonable one. C176PD—44—2-4-I4—GCBP SinkPut away yrith ,2^11 I X- Minute Paper. Secret Department.

The Treasury, not unreasonably, agree that politically it is desirable to treat the construction of the coaling depot as part of the wireless scheme, but consider that the question of allocation of cost should be dealt with on its merits. To this view we cannot reasonably take exception. As regards the merits of the case my opinion is that we have no claim unless we can show that the r construction of the depot is an integral part of the Arms Traffic Operations and that the cost of these operationsoperations should he shared by the Imperial Government. My reasons for taking this view are as follows• • expenditure m the Persian Gulf (including the cost of coal, as Mr. Barker points out, and also that of the coaling depots), though chiefly required for political purposes, is entirely home by Indian revenues, as part of the naval expenditure in Indian Waters for which we pay the Admiralty an annual subsidy of &lt;£100,000 a year, ihe coaling depots must clearly be placed where they will best answer their purpose, and this must in turn depend very largely on political considerations. Accordingly the fac &lt; proposed depot is part of. the general policy of consolidating our position in the Gulf does not in itself, I think, affect the question of the incidence of cost of the new depot. (2) Any claim that the ordinary naval outlay in the Gulf should be shared between the two Governments, like other diplomatic expenditure in Persia, would (D Under present arrangements the ordinary naval v clearlyclearly be resisted, and with success, by the Admiralty, on the ground that they consider our present total payment to them of &lt;£100,000 wholly inadequate. As a matter of fact we are at present considering a claim by the Admiralty that it should be enormously increased. The Political Secretary is in a better position than I to say whether the construction of the coaling s' depot at Henjam can properly be regarded as an integral part of the Arms traffic Operations, but S' prima facie the contrary would appear to be the case. The Operations in. question have no doubt drawn, attention to the desirability of the measure, hut it seems clear from Admiral Slade's earlier letter of the 6th April 1911 (Pol .1184/11) that the transfer of the depot from Basidu to Henjam ought to beundertaken in the interests of the ordinary naval movements in the Gulf just as much as in those of the special ope rations now in progress. Indeed there is no suggestion in that letter of any connection between those operationstransfer in. quest ion*So far as I can see we have no case for pressing our suggestion that the Imperial Government should share the cost of the transfer. As regards the incidence of the cost of the Arms Traffic Operations themselves it would he well to ash the Government of India whether, hut for the Persian interests involved, they could now dispense with the whole or part of the additional naval force at present employed (see telegram to India of 30th May, 1912 and their reply of 5th July 1912).v-ri In any further communication on this subject, please quote N , 18079/15. and address— The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, London.

While My Lords agree that politically it is desirable to treat the construction of the coaling depSt as part of the general scheme for the establish ment of wireless telegraph stations in the Gulf, mey see no reason why the allocation of the expenditure on the work should he treated in the same way. me case appears to Their Lordships to he analogous to that The Secretary, Admiralty.tlM of the proposed extension of the naval blockade against the arms traffic the Gnlf, as to „hich They caused Their views tn 'ho -» -u ■ V±^\ k s to he laid before the Lords ^ ^ nmiBBiontoiao of uhe Admiralty by Treasury Letter of f ^/ !2 ) the6th April last (5493/12). p 0 r the reasons expressed in that letter My Lords consider it preferable that the whole cost of the proposed de P 8t should fall upon Indian revenues; but, should it be found necessary to accept a moiety of the cost as a charge upon Imperial Funds, They are of opinion that the liability should rest with Navy Votes, rather than with the Vote for Diplomatic and Consular Services. I am, &amp;c., (Signed) T. L. Heath ssM,hi - 12208 • Confidential. ADMIRALTY . 3rd April, 1913. Sir: - In reply to your letter of the Btli ultimo, No. 3302, relative to the expense of establishing a coaling depot at Henjarn, I am commanded by my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to state, for the information of the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty^ Treasury, that this proposal, which has been under consideration for more than 12 months, was originally made on the ground that Henjam would be the most suitable base from which His Majesty's Ships could effectively carry out operations in the Persian Gulf especially if a Wireless Station were establish ed there. It is therefore not correct to regard the connection between this depot and the Wireless Telegraphy scheme as purely fictitious. 2. At the same time My Lords are in some doubt whether there is in this case any sufficient reason for departing from the usual procedure by which ex penses of this sort incidental to the normal service The Secretary, His Majesty's Treasury. ofof tiie Navy in the Persian Gulf are paid hy the Government of India, and they would themselves have hesitated to recommend that a moiety of the cost should fall upon Imperial Funds. So long however as Navy Votes are not affected they do not feel called upon to urge that the whole cost should he home hy Indian revenues, if the Secretaries of State for Foreign Affairs and India (who have charge of the arrangements) concur in thinking otherwise. 3. But to the suggestion that Navy Votes, rather than the Diplomatic and Consular Vote, should hear any proportion of the cost allocated to Imperial Funds, My Lords regret that they are wholly unable to assent. The existing Indian subsidy is based on the assumption that naval services in the Persiai Gulf are an Indian obligation, and that while on the one hand the Admiralty maintains a minimum number of ships in those waters on the other haid the Govern ment of India undertakes the payment of expenses on shore incidental to their maintenance there. Extensive naval operations against Persia or Turkey in defence of British rather than Indian interests mightiniglit call for a reconsideration of this arrangement, i but in ivly Lords opinion no such wide question is raised by the project now under discussion. * ! , '(Copy) yi T i'^XV' Telegram -?• put away with / ^ From The Secretary to the GoverEment of India in the Foreign Department, Simla, To- The Secretary to the Government of Bombay, P-ahlic Works Department, Bombay, lo.

WITH reference to your letter of the 16 th January, 1912 , on the subject of the establishment of wireless telegraph stations in the Persian Gulf, I am directed by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to transmit herewith, to be laid before the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury, a copy of a letter from the India Office covering telegraphic correspondence with the Government of India respecting the desirability of treating the construction of a landing pier and quarters for the coaling staff in the island of Henjam as part of the general scheme in question.* The question arises out of the desire of the Government of India to store 5,000 to*hs of coal on that island as being the best basis for His Majesty’s ships in the Gulf when the wireless station is installed. It was thought possible that the Persian Government might raise difficulties, but after satisfying himself that there was material for resisting eventual objections Sir E. Grey gave his consent to the Government of India’s proposal. It is obviously desirable, from the political point of view, that the establishment of the coaling station should attract as little attention as possible, and Sir E. Grey accordingly hopes that the Lords Commissioners will agree to its being treated as part of the wireless telegraph scheme and will sanction the moiety of any expenditure involved being charged to the diplomatic and consular vote. Estimates of the cost of the proposed works will be forwarded to their Lordships as soon as they are received. I am, &amp;c. LOUIS MALLET. h India Office, January 29, 1913.

It is desirable that a pier should be built, extending far enough to allow a lighter to lie alongside on each side of it at all normal states of the tide. Ihis would add greatly to the facilities for coaling His Majesty’s Shix^s. to offer has been received by the Senior Eaval Officer from Gillidary of Bandar Abbas, who is reported to be an experienced builder, to complete this pier in two months from the date of commence ment, for the sum of Rs. 5,000/-. This offer is considered reasonable. 3. The placing of a coaling station at Han jam, as well as a wireless station, will necessitate an additional supply of water, and as a 26 fA)GV3U ! y it is suggested that two covered tanks,tanks, which are at present in a bad state, should be repair ed before the next rainy season. Gillidary offers to effect this for Rupees 400 for each tank. ~±* Arrangements have been made for the Conductor in Charge to be quartered in the telegraph building pending suitable quarters being provided, but this can only be a temporary measure* it is suggested that this be considered in conjunction with the provision of quarters for the wireless staff. 5. Up to the present four men from one of His Majesty's Ships have been landed and left in charge of the coal. It is desirable that these should be withdrawn as soon as possible, and it is proposed that the Clerk in charge of the telegraph station should take over the charge, and that he should be paid Rupees 50/- a month for doing so, until such time as the stock of coal at Basidu has been used up and the Conductor can remove from that place to H&amp;njam. 6. A copy of a telegram received from the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, is attached. I concur in the opinion he expresses therein that nothing should be done until the arrival of the further 1600 tons of coal expected this month. I suggest that when this coal has been landed the repairs to the water tanks might be taken in hand;&gt; tiie other items, viz: - building of pier end provision oz. quarters xor the Conductor in Charge, could be deferred for the present, and carried out as part of the wireless project, and at the same time as the wireless station is being built.* I t(COPY. ) j^rom- The holitioal Hesident, Persian Gulf.

(Addressed to the Naval Commander-in-Chief.) The Senior Naval Officer received a copy of my telegram No. M-lll, regarding the Tamb and Zora before noon of 29th instant. The orders referred to in your reply to my telegram dated May 30th presumably reached him last night or this morn ing. I have nevertheless received from him now the following telegram which shows the manner in which he has interpreted orders referred to and the instruc tions issued by him to the Commander of His Majesty’s Ship “Odin”. “ Odin is now at Tamb and her Commander has been ordered to report to me most suitable place for the construction of light-house. I am informing you accord ingly under directions from Admiral in case you wish to visit Tamb.” In view of remarks contained in my telegram No. 111,1 take strong exception to the pro cedure which has been adopted in the matter. Further I would bring to your notice that notwithstanding that it was particularly desired by Secretary of State for India that coal s hould be landed at Pleniam with as little ostentation as possible, I am told here that parties from M[s~Majesty 7 s Ships have been for some weeks past l at Henjam engaged in blasting rock and building a stone jetty for landing coal. I have not been consulted nor have I received the slightest warning either from Your Excellency or the Senior Naval Officer as regards either of above matters. We have to handle in co-operation several other delicate matters pending in the near future and it is my business and responsibility as I am here to know from what source to expect political trouble and to advise how best to obviate it ; and unless I am treated with confidence and consulted previously as regards contem plated action of His Majesty’s Ships on the shore, I am obviously not in a posi tion to do justice to that responsibility. Consequently interests of British Gov ernment suffer and projects then become more difficult. I venture to draw Your Excellency’s attention to the letter which I addressed to your predecessor. Last regarding the Zora incident and the general orders which he issued there on, I trust that you will see your way to republish them.No. 51, dated Diyatalawa, the 5th June 1912. From—His Excell3ncy the Naval Commander-in-Chief, To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Marine Department. I have sent the following telegram to the'Political Resident in the Persian Gulf:— “It is reported by the Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf that no mark or tide pole was erected, that no communication was held with the inhabitants of the country, and that H. M. S. “ Odin ” took no action ashore in Tamb Island. It appears that he acted on my telegram to him, dated 10 th May 1912 , in which it was ordered that a report on a place on Tamb Island which would be most suitable for the landing of materials for the construction of a light-house should be submitted by telegraph. Since blocking ships anchor frequently in Tamb Island for shelter from shamed, I did not, when telegraphing, consider it likely that the Senior Naval Officer would require to send a ship. Ships could in any case be required only to verify information on the charts and it would not be necessary to land. Consulta tion with you was not, therefore, considered necessary by me. Apparently your cablegram No. M-lll was received too late for the Senior Naval Officer to take any action on my telegram to your address, dated 30 th May 1912 . I would observe w^regaidilLHeJU^pi that the clearing of some ground was necessary for the storage of coal for the landing of which approval had, as you were aware, been given. It would be very difficult to land coal without a pier of some kind. I regret that this should have been done without conferring with you and that the Senior Naval Officer should have permitted any blasting which it is re ported was only of a small amount. The working parties have embarked, and the construction of the pier has been stopped, and the Senior Naval Officer is being in formed by me that before anything more is done he should consult you. On 9 th June collier is due to arrive at Henjam. The above is in reply to your telegram No. M- 117 , and in continuation of my telegram of the 1st instant. SMBauaMi [Demi-Official.] Dated 8 th (received 16 th) October ion. _ , r -&gt; From— ‘Lieutenant-Colonel P. Z. Cox, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident, Persian Gulf, Bushire, To—E. H.S. CLARKE, Esq., C.I.E., Deputy Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. y Please see your demi-official letter dated 12th August regarding the precise nature of our tenure at Henjam. You enquired, whether, having regard to the terms of certain documents of which you kindly enclosed copies, l still consider that the contention that, w e have absolute control over the land ) as at Bassidu ” can be maintained. I could not answer you without taking up all the threads of the record again and found it difficult to get an opportunity to do so until I went to sea a few days ago. 2. In paragraph 2 of my letter No. 339, dated 20th August 1905 to the Foreign Department, I wrote that I did not contend “ that our rights within our Telegraph Station itself were quite on a par with our rights at Bassidu'' so that perhaps my more recent observation above quoted appeared inconsistent. But I do not think this is the case in reality. I fully admit that there is a difference between the two, namely that while we claim Bassidu to be an enclave of British territory on a Persian Island, we are ready in the case of Heniam to concede Persian sovereignty, or preferably suzerainty ; but I submit that we should claim, that, subject to that admission, we are masters in our own concession. 3 My line of argument briefly is, I speak with all deference, that Sir Arthur Hardinge at a time and in the communications to which you refer, was prepared to concede more than was really necessary, and that had the Persian Govern ment accepted what he said and so settled the matter definitely then we must no doubt have been content with the position in which Sir Arthur Hardinge placed us ; but that as, on the contrary,_ the Persian Government did not accept our offer then, or settle the controversy in any way, we are m a position, it they attempt to join issue with us again, to regard those negociations as nul and void and are at liberty to reconsider our position. . At the risk of going over some old ground again, I beg to amplify the above somewhat and record such arguments as suggest themselves to mein support of such a line of action. If we had been in a stronger position at Tehran when the Telegraph Station ■ A wp micrht verv oossiblv have succeeded in making good our srrr.' t ss r.T’’ 2 .i, —pi...! »*• i ^«* r - vour to do so but His Majesty's Government were not prepared to go so far But even if’we do not intend to claim the Henjam concession as a British But eve ' reason w hatever why we should resign ourselves to a Tors'e p'oshmn within the station than we enjoy at ]ask. On the contrary there is much to be said for claiming a more favourable one. . A , Jnslr vou will recollect, under the agreement of 25th February 1887, S- that the Telegraph establishment should “ take possession ” of cerTiTgrott and that “ thl Government of Jask shall have„no right whatso- ever onany account to interfere in the interior of those limits. a. *. “ ** afcas&amp;sr stts*-« Curzon’s Persia, Volume 11, page 428. occupation remained unnoticed and un* SSung ' agent to ttaOLh a Customs House.” f, At Heniam we are, 1 submit, on stronger ground than we were at Jask ^ • *. ’ or thar Inland aonarentlv always was and still is claimed c'tr I,- k; ATrsfalk^LiThlfpLopTeTXhlve lived there undisturbed for generations2 have exercised such rights as those of jetsam and flotsam. Both they and the Sultan of Maskat have agreed to our occupation, while neither of them has ever recognised Persian authority. n Again it seems to me that, whereas we have discussed with the Persian j Government the limits of our concession at Henjam, and our title to place a Telegraph Station on Henjam at all, the question of the precise natme of our rights within the area occupied, has never been specifically in issue with them, and on these grounds I submit that, in any case, and notwithstanding the docum ents which you quote, the field of argument on this point is still open so that we can if we choose, claim that, subject to the reversionary suzerainty of the Persian Government over the Island as a whole, we have absolute right of control in the area occupied. 8. It is clear from the correspondence of 1866 (in_ the course of which unfortunately Colonel Felly’s views seemed to have been given little consideration by the Government of Bombay) what the ideas of the Gulf Residency then were both as to the purpose for which, and the conditions under which we should and could establish ourselves on the Island. Colonel Pelly considered that in view of past practice and of communications which had been exchanged with the Sultan of Maskat, we were undoubtedly justified in occupying the station . Since then the term ‘‘occupation ” has been frequently used - reference to our tenure, and as late as the 6th June 1906, in their telegram No. 2327-E. A. t e Government of India observed that the “ retention of absolute control over the land is important”, etc. o It will be remembered that in their despatch No. 16, dated the^ 21st lanuary 1904, addressed to the Secretary of State for India, after the visit of the Viceroy and Sir Arthur Hardinge to the Gulf, the Government of India advocated the adoption of a much bolder attitude in regard to Henjam than that which was ultimately assumed by His Majesty’s Minister; the fact being, believe that on his return to Tehran from the Gulf Sir Arthur Hardinge fo un d the Persian Government, on whom the Russian Legation and Monsieur Naus had, no doubt, been working in his absence, so assertive and difficult to deal with that he was unable to make good the line of action originally contemplated. But at that time there was no discussion, ad hoc, of the question of the nature of our tenure ; while in regard to the other issues raised, no definite adjustment was arrived at, and the Persian Government dropped the subject. Since then (1904) we have put 7 years more of occupation to our credit, and w T e seem free, as far as the hitherto undiscussed question of tenure is concerned, to adopt, when it is raised, any attitude which a consideration of the history of our connec tion with Henjam, ab initio, appears to us to make possible and expedient. 10. After all, the foundations of the Persian claim to sovereignty seem by no means unassailable. In this connection please see the Preambles and Articles 13 of the two leases given in Aitchison, Volume XII, as Appendix XLV. In these, reference is only made to “ the Islands of Kishm and Hormuz , and “ the above-mentioned tw r o Islands Not a w'ord about Henjam. See also page 138 of the same volume. I cannot trace precisely what w r as the documental authority and w T hat w’ere the facts, which prompted or obliged the Government of Bombay in their letter No. 283 of 31st December 1867 to the Foreign Department to read “ Henjam into the words “ the Islands of Kishm and Hormuz ”. So far as my record indicates we seem to have gratuitously treated Henjam as a dependency of Kishm, and I should very much doubt, if beyond our kind and unspecific re cognition the Persian Government have any authority to show- at all, for until the Island w-as occupied by the Arab colony from the Irucial Coast, with the Sultan’s permission, it w r as not inhabited, so that the Persian Government would have no Customs or Revenue records \vhich they could produce in support of their title. If the Sultan of Maskat actually ceded Henjam (apparently he does not admit it) why was the fact ignored in the Lease Agreement, and why was the Island not mentioned with Kishm and Hormuz ? Henjam is practically the same size as Hormuz ; it had been separately surveyed and charted by theVide paragraphs I and 2 of letter No. 115 , dated the 1 st December 1866 , from the Resident to the Government of Bombay. (Noth.—I cannot trace the previous correspon dence of 1863 or 1864 referred to in paragraph ,._P. Z.C.) * Cf. Curzon, Volume II, page 423 . f Vide paragraph 4 of Resident’s letter No. 10 , dated 16 th February | 866 , to the Government of Bombay. Indian Navy as early as 1821-29 and there is no doubt that it was recognised as a distinct entity at that time, just as much as Hormuz, and was inhabited then as now, by Oman Arabs hailing originally from Debai, but regarding themselves as Maskat subjects qua settlers on a Maskat Island, under the auspices of the Maskat Sultan. 11. I would not go so far as to suggest that we encourage the Sultan of Maskat again to press his claim to the Island, but I certainly think that if the Persian Government bother us, we should use the Maskat connection as a lever for bringing them to reason, on the lines suggested in paragraph 9 of my official letter of 28th June, reminding them also - - * that His Highness’s consent to the esta blishment of a Telegraph Station had been obtained long before, and that our original rights were derived from actual occupation with the consent of the reigning Sultan many years before that again, when Henjam was his hereditary s s possession, cf. also Aitchison XII* page 208, Article 7. For instance, we occupied it in connection with the Ras-el-Khaima ex pedition in iSao.t 12 I do not recapitulate all this ancient history with the idea that we should attempt spontaneously to argue Maskat sovereignty (although the Sultan and the inhabitants still claim it), but rather in order to demonstrate hat the foundation for the Persian claim is by no means so sure as to necessitate accepting any bounce from her in regard to the question of our tenure. It sne challenges our right to full control, I suggest that we should retort, after arguing as abovf suggested, that if she is obstructive we shall consider 0l ! rsel J es “ n h de ' obligation to continue to neglect the Arab claims to sovereignty both over Hemam and over Sirri, with which we are still periodically importuned, but to which! out of friendly regard for the Persian Government, we have hitherto made no response. So much for theory and argument. Turning to practical facts, I learn from your letter that the Government of India do not consider that the presen^ moment is a suitable one for making any steps in the direction of starting a store in any form. 1 thic mnnertion I am inclined to urge that fresh and cogent developments accentuate fhe advantage of put.t.g ace .&lt;»&gt; down and constitute natural grounds for doing so. ^ 1 1 Arms Traffic shifting its main activities out of the Gulf of Oman St into W t e he Gulf of Persia and conducted Batineh to the desert parts ol the October) A few years ago the life October, and my telegram No. IO, 4 been worth a day’s of a Shiah Persian attempting sue 1 , J t0 [ iave melted away in purchase ; now religious animosity and into erance seem the torrid atmosphere of the gun-running trade.

In any case I earnestly hope that in considering any proposal or question hinging on the nature of our position at Henjam the Government of India will not underrate the great strategical and political advantage which it would be to us now-a-days to achieve for ourselves a position on the Island, or part of it—either by making the most of our concession, or by lease, or other alternative—which would place us in a position to use it as we pleased. In addi tion to the consideration that the Henjam Strait forms the most central and protected coaling anchorage in these waters, many troublesome problems would by that means find direct or indirect solution. Take for example, the question of the oft proposed International Sanitary Station for the Gulf, a bogey which periodically reappears and which the recent epidemics of plague at Bahrain and Debai are likely to revive acutely at any moment. Foreign intrigues in the direction of the establishment of such a Station would be to a great extent silenced if we had a Sanitary Station of our own at Henjam at which British vessels entering with cargo and leaving with pilgrims could be dealt with. Again, many of our difficulties in dealing with the Trucial Coast would dis appear if we had a settlement at Henjam. It could be used as a distributing port for British trade as Colonel Peily, with his usual prescience, advocated nearly half a century ago; and an Assistant Resident located there, with cable connec tion to the Trucial Coast, would be most favourably placed for managing the Shaikhs without the somewhat penible necessity of living among them. I fear this letter has assumed great length, but the question of Henjam is possessed of so much importance and potentiality that I trust l shall be for given for spreading myself somewhat over it. .

In case the Persian Government complains, we could explain that we did it for the purposes of the blockade, and that we had not the intention of annexing the Island. 44 We might propose to pay a small rental for the right of storing coal, or to sur render Basidu in exchange, whilst retaining possession of the old cemetery (the sur render of Basidu is deprecated by the Government of India). Please let me have your view r s by wire as to the best way to proceed.” Ends. Have you any observations 1 Is there sufficient accommodation available at the telegraph station, and do you think a guard would be necessary ? In case the Persian Government protest, it would suffice, in my opinion, to ex plain that we need the coal and the annexation of the Island is not intended by us. Telegram P, No. 78-290, dated Bushire, the 21st March 1912. From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. There is ample room at the Telegraph Station for the coal, and no guard would be required. I would suggest, for Your Excellency’s consideration, the fol lowing procedure, in reference to your telegram 43. The coal should be deposited unostentatiously at the Telegraph Station: should the Governor of the Gulf Ports raise the question with me, I would inform him that the step had been taken in connection with Arms Traffic Blockade of the coast above Lingah, as a matter of emergency, for the reason that the larger of His Majesty’s ships, such as the “Fox,” are unable to coal at Basidu. In the meantime, in order to prepare the ground, remonstrances would be addressed by Your C2 FD 8T ''f~ T 9 2 • 0 Excellency to the Persian Government on the subject of the wholesale smuggling of arms now being carried on by the inhabitants of Shibkuh, Dashti andTangistan and the great expense and trouble which involved thereby to us. Should the Governor of the Gulf Ports not be silenced by my explanations and should the Persian Government move in the matter, Your Excellency will know nothing about it and refer to me for the facts. If, on having heard them, the Persian Government press their objections, the terms of a further communication can be considered .

After consultation with Cox, I see no objection to storing the coal at the telegraph station. Coal should be, of course, deposited as unostentatiously as possible. If the governor of the Gulf ports raises objections, Cox proposes, and I concur, to reply that the step was taken as a matter of emergency in connection with arms traffic blockade on the coast above Lingah, reason being that larger ships such as the “Hood” cannot coal at Basidu. We could consider question as to a rent or other compensation it the Persian Government raise objection. Meanwhile I shall say nothing about the step we are taking, but, at Cox’s suggestion, I propose to prepare the ground for the contingency of a complaint by remonstrating with the Persian Government regarding wholesale arms smuggling and the great trouble and expense it is causing us. 3QPV TO INDIA | 29 MAR 1912 I [SECRETARY’;.'

It is a cable station, and on the direct route of the British India Steam navigation Company's Steamers when passing up and down the Gulf, so that arrangements could probably be made also for a regular mail service to and from the Island. Strategical ly Hanjam is of great importance, as i&gt;. contiol~ the entrance to the Gulf, and if a Wireless Telegraph Station should eventually be installed there, as recommended in my letter Ho. 24/1470 of 4th February 1911 ,addressed to the Marine Department, Hanjam will then be the best case for H.M.Ships employed in the Persian ^ .....i -. 3, The question of the establishment o- a oqcl~ depo ^ ^ Hang am has now become more important than before, owing to the strength of the blockade having been shifted to the ShibkuhShiDkuli and Tangistan Coasts of Persia, and to the necessity for providing stowage for the large amount or coal which is being sent to the Persian Gulf in _p r^oqsib^lity ox a coal strike in Maxell consequence o^ the possxD-xxu^ next. 4.

Unless the de^ at Eanjam be establishes., - ships will have to obtain their coa .1 from Masqat. This will withdraw them from the -blockade for considerable of time and useless expenditure periods, and entail loss of coal in steaming 240 miles to and from Masqat, or nearly 500 miles on each occasion of coaling. 6. The establishment of the proposed deptft at Hanjam vnll obviate all these difficulties, as space is available for in a situation where it can 'be worked without lie within 100 yards of the shore, any quantity difficulty, and ships can f»mise 5000 tons of coal to be landed I therefore propose to cause -cuu vox o4- Unnlam unless the Govern— at the telegraph concession at Hanjam, ment of India should otherwise direct. 7 . it will be necessary for the Royal Indian Marine, as a temporary measure, to detail a Conductor to take °Harge offrig) the coal and to account for its receipt and issue* Ec will live in a tent for the present, hut arrangements can he made for the provision of suitable protection before the hot weather sets in* All other labour will oe arranged locally* 8.

Hen jam Island. establish It will be seen that the Government of India propose to deposit 5,000 tons of coal on the island—presumably within the limits of the British Concession—apparently without previous reference to the Persian Govern ment ; and they recommend that, if later on that Government raise the question of the nature and extent of British rights on the island, negotiations should be opened with them on the basis of our old rights, and that, in certain circumstances, it should be explained that the occupation is temporary. The riarhts to which the Government of India refer are those conferred by the late Shah on 29th March 1868 for the construction of a telegraph station; and it will be remembered that not only have the limits of the land then conveyed never been defined, but the Persian Government have maintained, as recently as 1906, that no land was conveyed at all. It is true that they were then informed that His Majesty’s Government considered that their acquiescence in the actual facts of the British occupation from 1868 to 1880 must be regarded as equivalent to a formal concession of the land occupied. But they have never accepted that view, and, from the previous history of the question, it appears very probable that the action proposed by the Government of India u r ill be followed by an immediate protest from the Persian Government. And even if the nature of the concession were undisputed, the Marquess of Crewe thinks it probable that they would protest against an interpretation of the Minute of 29th March 1868 which should involve the conversion of a telegraph station into a coaling station without previous reference to themselves. While therefore Lord Crewe agrees with the Government of India as to the desirability of securing a coaling station in that region, and as to the superiority of Henjam (which he believes to be undisputed) to Basidu for that purpose, he feels that the proposal must be considered in the light of our general relations with Persia at the present moment, and he would not be disposed to press it if Sir E. Grey thinks the moment unfavourable. And he would suggest, as an alternative to the course proposed by the Government of India, that the Persian Government should be informed that we intend, The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office. S. 142.&gt; as part of the blockade operations undertaken in their interest, to store coal temporarily in the precincts of the telegraph station on Hen jam ; and that when the store has been in existence for a few months, negotiations should be opened with them for its permanent retention, if necessary, in exchange for Basidu.

A dmiral strongly urges desirability of storing 5,00 &gt; tons of coal at Henjani which will become best base for His Majesty’s ships in the GuJf when wireless telegraph station is installed. Basidu is unsuitable, and Henjani, which has natural advantages, is more important than before owing blockade being shifted to the Shibkuh and Tangistan coasts. We do not consider it expedient to raise question of right with Persian Government and propose to authorise Admiral to act as he proposes and leave Persian Government to object if they see fit to do so. ^ i ii • We shall be glad of very early instructions. We can always call it a temporary measure due to the shifting of area of blockade that we are carrying out on behalf of Persian Government. -•4</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000419.0x00007b_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/10/230</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x00007b</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/10/230</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>File 759/1912 'Henjam Coal Depot: Persian Customs'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1912/1923</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-05-11T22:02:21</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 volume (215 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the volume.
