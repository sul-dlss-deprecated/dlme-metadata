Dear Sir, His Highness wishes a Customs and Police post to be set up at Sitra as soon as possible. His Highness is of the opinion that such a post will do much to reduce the smuggling which is still going on and it will also enable the authorities to check the movements of Arabs in that vicinity. His Highness has suggested that this post should be on the Sitra wharf or at the land end of the causeway. I should be obliged if you would let me have your views on the matter. Yours faithfully, Adviser to the Government. cc H.B.M*s Political Agent, Bahrain. Confident^'.Ifo. FA-153. I U 1 11th February, 194-8. The Adviser to the Bahrein Government, MANAMA, Bahrein Island. Dear Sir, &gt;, 663-3 ft Please refer to your letter No. 663-13/20 of January 27th, 194-8 reference the request of His Highness for a Customs and Police post In the Sltra area. The Company has carefully considered this matter and, assuming that His Highness Is Interested In checking the movements of local craft in the Sltra anchorage and the unauthorized landing of goods in this area, it suggests that the Company^ old Sitra Jetty should be quite satisfactory for the following reasons 1. There are good mooring facilities and an adequately marked channel to the deep water anchorage. 2. It lies on the normal route that local craft follow in traversing the island from north to south or vice versa. 3. 4. 5 . 6. 7 . Housing facilities on a rental basis could be made available for the policemen. Water and cooking facilities are also available. It is the headquarters for a goodly number of fishing and local craft. The Company's records indicate that it has been used in the past by some seamen for unauthorized landing of goods and immigrants as the Company's private police force have apprehended men in this area. The Company's new causeway and pier are kept free of local craft by the Company's own security section and therefore we believe very little, if any, smuggling takes place at that point. Confidential. Ht BAHRAIN RECEIPT. /&gt; % . • ae. lU.No. PA-153. 11th February, 1948 - 2 8. Old Sltra Jetty could be made available Immediately with small cost, whereas if His Highness required space on the new installation it would require a very expensive fill, a new launch dock and other facilities which would not only require considerable time but would require considerable outlay of monies to complete. The Company suggests that if a customs post is required that His Highness consider a location at Sitra bridge, which would permit examination of all road traffic between the main island and Sitra Island. The Company assumes that its own trucks and cars on legitimate business would not be subject to the delay that would be necessary for a strict customs search. The Company^ representative will be pleased to discuss this problem with the Adviser to the Government and go over the ground and facilities available with him at any time that may be convenient to the Adviser.
