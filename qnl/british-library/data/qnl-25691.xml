It must not be taken for granted that Germany will return to the League as a matter of course 0 her future relationship to the League cannot be discussed so long as her equ&amp;ity of rights is in any way disputed from other quarters a Memorandum sets out serious doubts felt by German Government wnether in the existing circumstances the proposed pact system can be considered as an affective instrument of oeace. International negotiations have shown the extraordinary difficulties m the way of any collective pact system containing the obligationobligation of automatic military assistance* How could Germany I in particular in her central situation in the midst of heavily armed States undertake obligation to intervene in conflicts of other States which cannot be foreseen and which do not concern her or in which she is not interested ? Further Germany can hardly expect any real advantages from the Pact which would balance its dangers* German Government are inclined to believe that in general best results will be achieved by bilateral agreements which can be adapted to .concrete circumstances. They do not wish to reject altogether idea of multilateral pacts but if it is ueeired to pursue this idea they earnestly suggest that stress should not be laid on agreement for immediate military assistance in case of war but rather on other methods of securing peace, eog* collective obligation of non-aggression, and consultation in a political crisis between Powers interested* Best guarantee of peace will always be found not in preparing for war against war but in extending and strengtheningD03 \ INDEXES Communications on this subject should be addressed to— The Under-Secretary of State, Dominions Office, Downing Street, London, S.W.l, and the following number quoted :— .

Part II !0o3J p e mo IDth «July,l934 Important. Secret., Circular telegram B 0 No 0 74o Reference my circular telegram of 28th June BoNOcCVo lo The principal object of MBarthou’e visit to London was to explain the proposals for Eastern Locarno Treaty v of which the text was communicated to us shortly by bftfore/the French Ambassador (see my texegram Circular' BoNo^YS of to-day's date for text of proposals as so communicated)„ 2o In the form first expounaed by M.Barthou the proposed Pact was open to the objection that it was associated with ana conditioned upon a Franco-Ruseian guarantee which in fact provided no corresponding assurances to Germany if the latter was attacked by France or Russia* H C M U Government in the United Kingdom took objection to the scheme in this form (an objection which we understand to have been shared by the German Government.) It woe pointed out that it could not be regarded as analogous to the Locarno Treaty under which guarantees were reciprocal and operated as much in favour of Germany as of France* whereas M Buthou^ scheme would naturally be regarded asea a Franco-Rueeian association fop the mutual protection of these two countries against (iermany without any reciprocal assurances to Germa-jy, H c Government in the United Kingdom therefore Indicated that If they were to show any interest in the proposal for an Western Locarno (and they have in principle already declared their willingness to see the creation of other regional security pacts on the Locerno model provided that it wae understood clearly that they did not themselves enter into any new commit ment or responsibility) it was essential that this feature snould be altered; On the one hand France should be prepared to give to Germany the some guarantee ae she gave to Russia; on the other hand Russia ought to offer to Germany the same assurances of help if Germany was attacked by France as she was prepared to offer to France if France was attacked by Germany,, In other words, if Russia was prepared to underwrite the Locarno Treaty^ the new assurances must apply to both sides, 4 Another important modification which we pressed upon M, Barthou was that Germany was unlikely to adopt the scheme of an Eastern Locarno unless it me associated with some new orospect of agreement about armaments so that the pursuit of equality of rights in armaments might accompany the new development of a regime of security,, 5 M Barthou agreed to give us satisfaction on both these matters* 6., 14*Barthou wae then informeu that H.XGovernment in the United Kingdom had already declared themselves ready to see Russia become a member of the League of Nations if she applied to ,1oin it; and that on the clear understanding that they do not intend as far as they are concerned to assume any new commitments in the matter of regional pacts, H»i4oGovernment in the United Kingdom would be prepared to recommend the scheme feran Eastern irfutuaX Guarantee Peat to the German and Polish Govdrnroenta proviaed that they were authorised to inform these Governments oe follows; (a) fiuseia,, in the view of the French Government, ought &gt; be prepared to give to Gemany as well as to France the same guarantees againct non-provoked aggression ae thosa which she would be bound to give if she were a signatory of the Treaty of Locarno, i (b) In regard to the proposed Kaetern Pact France would be prepared to give the same guaranteea to both Germany and Russia . (c) The French Government agree with fcLXGovernment in the United Kingdom in holding that the ccmclueion of such a pact and the participation of Germany in the system of reciprocal guarantees now contemplated would afford the best ground for the resumption of negotiations for the conclusion of a convention such as would provide for a reasonable application of the principle of German equality of rights in a regime of security for all nations, 7„ M Barthou agreed to these stipulations which in our view render the reciprocal character of the pact as now proposed unexceptionable. In these circumstances and having in mind our constant objective of promoting reciprocal good relatione and reconciliation between the French and German points of view we have decided to recommend the scheme in Berlin and jarsaw, 8 t&gt; It has been necessary to boar in mind in this connection that if a furthe*- regional security pact of this character is not successfully negotiated^ the alternative may easily come about of a Franco-Rueelan understanding or alliance on the pre-war model; indeed it seems that the first concrete proposals which came from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics were directed towards something of the latter nature* which I •' in our view would constitute an unfortunate return to thesystem of select alliances.* 9 Instructions have therefore been sent to HU a Ambassadors in Berlin and Warsaw to oxpreaa to the German and Polish Governments the earnest hope of H,M 0 Government in the United Kingdom that they will share our view of these proposals and that In that event they will dt&gt; their utmost to ensure the success of the negotiations and will partici pate in the pact* 10. Instructions have also been sent to H.M t .Ambassador in Rome to inform the Italian Government of the substance of the discussions with M Bartbou and the conclusions reached as indicated above, to express the hope that as co-guarantors of the Treaty of Locarno, they will share our view of the French proposals as now amplified and clarified* and that if so they will make known their view in the capitals directly concerned and particularly in Warsaw and Berlin; HoM*a Ambassador has boon as nod to add that we attach the greatest importance to the United Kingdom and Italian Governments adopting a corresponding attitude towards the new proposals,&gt; 11 0 On Priuay the 13th July a debate on foreign affairs is taking place in the Houes of Common* and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs propose* io reply to questions as to the conversations with M.Barthou which will certainly be asked, to describe in general term* H.Bartbou'* original proposal and to give seme account of the arrsngemen t-s mu do with M c Berthou and the action which 1* in consequence being taken*'EKUMmiM from the Seoretazj of State for Boalnlon Affaire to the of the CoMomrealtfe of Australia, the OoTernor Gemeral of Koa Zealand, the Minister of External Affaire Ifni on of Sooth Afrioa and the Minister for External Affairs Irish Free State (hy Inportant.
