The design of the back is simple with slightly unbalanced proportions. The workmanship of the piece is good and it is simply made. \r\n\r\nThis amulet has a recreative and /or good luck connotation; the duplication of the signs should strengthen the effect. The third sign is either a fill character, or refers to the all-inclusiveness of 'perfect existence.' The scarab originally would have been mounted or threaded. \r\n\r\nThe combination of signs on the bottom of this scarab is not common.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/36102", "Keywords": null, "Provenance": "Henry Walters, Baltimore [date and mode of acquisition unknown]; Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest.", "Dynasty": "15th Dynasty", "Reign": null, "OnView": 0, "PublicAccessDate": "2009-09-11T09:35:05.56", "Creator": "Egyptian (?)", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_42.37_Bot_DD_RS2009.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_42.37_Bot_DD_RS2009.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_42.37_Bot_DD_RS2009.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_42.37_Bot_DD_RS2009.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_42.37_Bot_DD_RS2009.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1522053, 1543485", "ExhibIDs": "", "Images": "CUR_42.37_Back_DD_RS2009.jpg, CUR_42.37_Bot_DD_design_RS2009.jpg, CUR_42.37_Bot_DD_RS2009.jpg, CUR_42.37_Rt_DD_RS2009.jpg, CUR_42.37_VwA_DD_hieroglyphictext_RS2009.jpg, CUR_42.37_VwA_DD_TranscriptionRS2009.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Not On View"}
