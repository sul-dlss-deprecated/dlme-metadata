Ae regards the point raised in the second paragraph of your letter, we are quite hanpy to fall in with your views as to what constitutes evacuation. As to the amount of money to he paid to any individual, our view is that generally speaking the measure Ox assistance afforded should he based broadly on the cost of transfer to the Arab coast. we are, however, quit© agreeable to the suggestion made at the end of paragraph 3 of your letter.

Subject to the Government of India being prepared to provide half this sum we are willing to sanction this proposal. I assume that no steps will be taken in this connexion until it is certain that the evacuation of Basidu is imminent. As regards the degree of assistance to be afforded in individual cases, we agree that the best plan is that the Political Resident should be given a free hand. We assume, however, that the amount given in individual cases would not normally exceed the sum actually necessary to transfer the individuals concerned from Basidu to the Arabian Coast.

J ily dear Laithwaite , You may remember that I recently discussed with you the question of obtaining authority from the treasury and the Government of India to place a sum of money at the disposal of the Political Resident for the assistance of those inhabitants of British Basidu who might wish to move elsewhere if they knew that we were going to evacuate it. 2. I now send, with many apologies for the delay, a copy of the letter from Hoare which gave rise to our discussion, as well as a copy of the draft of a private letter which I subsequently left with Bridges as an unofficial memorandum. 3. Bridges seemed quite hopeful about the prospects of the Treasury contributing towards the sum of/ J.G. laithwaite, Esq,, G.I.Eof £400, but he is going to look into the question further. 4* You will receive officially as soon as I can send it to you a copy of a despatch from Hugessen (E 300/300/34) on the subject of the use of the British area as a refuge for Persian subjects evading conscrip- tion, etc. 5. If these papers all reach you in time we might have a word about the subject to-morrowCopy* (E 7243/26/34) Ho. 374/0-51/1 . BRITISH LEGATION, TEHRAN. 15th November, 1934. My dear Rendel, You will no doubt by now have received from the India Office a copy of the Senior Naval Officer's report No. 44/423 of October 21st about conscription at Basidu. 2. The only ultimate solution of all these difficulties will be to assist those of the inhabitants who wish to leave. If, after having been warned, some of them elect to remain (as I imagine most would in fact do) our responsibility is at an end. 3. In this connection, have you yet succeeded in extracting the money from the Treasury? (see my letter No. 374/0-38/1 of June 16th). 4* The present situation is certainly rather awkward. We can't openly assist these people to leave as long as we intend to keep the British flag flying at Basidu. Anything like a mass exodus now would give the inhabitants and the neighbouring Persian authorities the definite impression that we had abandoned our 'rights** in Basidu and were at most clinging to a pied-a-terre of the Hen^am type. The result might quite possibly be another flag incident. 5 # Yet here we have the Persians forcing these folk to take out Persian papers and any day we may be faced G.W. Rendel, Esquire, O.M.G., The Foreign Office* withwith the invasion of British Basidti 'by the press gang and the removal of young men for conscription, Gan we allow thio to happen? It is true that the young men, having 1-ersian papers, will he liable to military service, hut even in the unlikely event of the Persians asking us to hand them over, can we in decency do so as long as we maintain the status quo as regards Basidu? I suppose we should have to appeal to the old H status quo ft argument, hut that in its turn will make the Persians start arguing again about Basidu# You may wish to turn over these matters in your mind, in case we are faced suddenly with the emergency foreseen above# 6# I am sending a copy of this to Bushire (No. 18?). Yours ever, (Signed) R.H# Hoare.Registry No. E 373/300/34, Draft. Mr, E,E. Bridges, M.C. , TREASURY. F. o.; January , 1935 . I have 'been asked to consult you privately about the possibility of providing some measure of financial assistance for such of the inhabitants of t, British ,, Basidu as may wish to settle elsewhere when they learn that the British area, from which Persian officials have hitherto been excluded, is sooner or later to be surrendered to Persia. 2. An article providing for the surrender of this area, or to be more accurate, of British H rights” at Basidu, has, as you know, formed part of the proposed general Treaty with Persia ever since that treaty first began to be negotiated in 1928. But the Persian Government have, concurrently with the negotiations, shown an increasing interest in the area and the manifestation of this interest...*V. ^ interest, in addition to provoking some regrettable incidents, has forced us to make a closer examination than before of the legal . ■ 'basis of our rights. This examination (I mean* of course, the law Officers^ opinion) * has shown these rights to he of very flimsy texture and we should probably find it ■ N difficult, if not impossible, to make any * effective resistance if the Persians, while admitting the existence of the n rights M (to, for instance, a coaling station), were to insist on entering and administering the area without waiting for the conclusion of the general treaty. At present, fortunately, the; seem to be doing little in this direction except make the inhabitants of the area take out Persian identity papers if they wish to cross into 'Persian' territnrv ^uniory - as most of them have to do in order to work or trade - but they may become active again at any time. T9 ^ • • • __ 3 • • •1 In any case the weakness of our position has led to the suggestion Peing made that the British area should he surrendered forthwith, before any further incidents can occur. This is a question of policy into which it is unnecessary to enter here, hut in ■ , ' 1 the course of the discussions which have raged around it hoth Hoare (until recently Minister at Tehran) and Fowle (the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf) have urged very strongly that some thought should he given while there is yet time to the position of the inhabitants of the British area. 4. These inhabitants have for over a century i been treated locally as if they were British . subjects, or at any rate British protected persons. Persian officials have been prevented from arresting them, taxing them, conscripting , fl them or molesting them in any way, and they and their goods and the vessels which carried the goods have been exempt from the authority of the Persian customs while lying off the British ...British area. Such administration as there has been since the depdt was removed fias 'been carried on by a headman or ''caretaker' appointed by the Political Resident, while the commanding officers of His Majesty's ships have kept a general eye on the area and occasionally composed small differences among the inhabitants. This is in the main, though increasingly precariously, the situation that obtains to-day, with the addition that in the face of the attempted Persian encroachment of the past few years the inhabitants *have been encouraged, and even instructed, to refuse compliance with Persian demands for taxes, military service, etc. 5. It is true that even in the past this situation was based on custom rather than law. As far back as 1868 the government of India decided that Basidu was not Britishadministration and I do not suppose that the inhabitants have ever been officially as British protected persons. On th&lt; On the basis recognised that Basidu is Persian territory it would have been largely immaterial if they had been, for although some of them may have arrived in their own persons, or those of their fathers or grand!athers, from Arab States under some degree of British protection (as a matter of fact many are ex-slaves or the descendants of ex-slaves) they would probably have acquired Persian nationality as well, by this time, and this would be their master nationality on Persian soil. But none of this alters -the fact that the absence of all traces of Persian administration from the British area has been a reality for over a century and that the result for the inhabitants has been just the same as if it had been full-fledged British territory. 6. There are about 140 persons in the British area, divided among 37 families. None of them are Indian British subjects, but fiveare ex-slaves from the Arab coast. It is quite possible, even likely perhaps, that most of them, who are generally speaking in very humble circumstances, would not suffer any more oppression as the result of he^ng handed over to Persia than the ordinary Persian subject already suffers almost as a matter of course. They would he liable to taxation, conscription, etc., which ^he^ have hitherto escaped, but these things,I 7* There is, I 'believe, a general repugnance on the part of successive governments in this country to transfer British subjects to foreign rule and the position seems to he that the inhabitants of Basidu are in s ome sense morally, though not legally, British subjects and liable in this case to be transferred to a power whose reputation for fair dealing does not rank very high. They have at any rate been dependent upon us for so long that it would hardly he fair to transfer them without any warning of what was coming and without some effort to safeguard their future. We cannot, however, hope to secure any guarantees as to their future treatment from the Persian Government or expect that these guarantees would be of any value once we had surrendered the British area. The only alternative seems to be to offer to assist those who wish to do so to settle outside Persian territory, and we feel strongly that as a general ... . tgeneral principle this assistance should he offered even though there are some grounds for thinking that most of those concerned would elect to remain if the prospect of moving were presented to them as a concrete issue (though, again, these same people would prohahly ieel aggrieved in after years if they had never had a chance of moving). 8. The matter can also of course be regarded from the point of view of prestige. If we mate no offer, we may be accused in the Gulf of deserting our protegds, mahy of whom are only there at all because they or their fathers fled to what was then regarded as British territory. Our prestige in the Gulf may suffer in consequence and this is a point of considerable importance. But to me personally it seems of less importance than the fact that the accusation will he true - we really shall have deserted our prot&lt;$g(5 s , even though the risk of anything very dreadful happening • • •happening to them may have heen small, if we can and do offer assistance and if some or all decline it, our responsibilities will he at an end and we can contemplate the surrender of Basidu without misgiving or regret If we make no offer, we may always have a feeling that our treatment of our erstwhile prot&lt;§g£s was not all it might have heen, if the debt, regarded as a debt of honour, can be met for a few hundred pounds it seems fairly cheap at the price, 9, As regards details, Powle has suggested that a lump sum of £400 should be placed at his disposal to help any of the inhabitants who wish to move in anticipation of the change of administration. He thinks that the number of those who have definitely, Anv who did so would prohatly to leave. Any wnu make for the Arab coast, where they could life afresh. It would he vezy difficult to lay down any hard and fast rules as to the degree of assistance to he afforded in individual cases and the best arrangement would, he thinks, he for him to he given a free hand to help those who required help up to a limit of £400, much of which might not, with luck, have to l&gt;e spent at all.our (the Foreign Office) point of view is to find out if the money can he made available at all. 11. A separate question is that of the Government of India sharing in the expenditure. 12.

B. You will remember that Fowle recommended (in agreement with Hoare) that he should be authorised to spend up to a naxlmuHi of say £400 In such manner as he thought best. In informal ' agreement with the F.o. we thought it I useless to pursue this question until H.M.G. had made up their minds as to their policy in regard to Basidu. Now, however, that a provisional I decision to evacuate, subject to alternative accommodation being provided, has been taken, we have thought it well to go more closely into tne question of compensation. Both we and the F.O. still think that in the light of the correspondence Fowle r s suggestion is the best. But the question arises of the extent to which India would be prepared to contribute to the expenditure and the/the object of «y present letter/to enquire whether, If the Government of India agree witii tiie Resident* oney would be prepared to bear a moiety on the understanding that the balance was borne by the Treasury. Vt'V' 3 . we/are, of course, as you nay imagine, anxious to avoid committing India to expenditure in connection with the reorganisation now contemplated in the Gulf. But there seems good reason to believe that we shall succeed in persuading the Admiralty not to raise any question of an Indian contribution for the development of the Bahrein naval base and to confine any Indian contribution to the development of Khor quwai to such charges (we are not, incidentally, very clear as to their nature or amount) as India at present meets in respect of the depot at Henjam. You will remember, too, that at an earlier stage, when there was some hope of our being aole to secure the \ retention of the Henjam depot in return for an annual rent, luaia was prepared! to Phy half of this. On the whole, as the amount now In question i s very small and India has always been very closely associated with Basidu, we do not trunk that a contribution would “ ^ Pre ^ lc e our general poslj and we trust that the G. 0 f X . wlu J tneir way to agreeing to it. (BcL) j. c. Walton ion94 You will remember tiiat at tne end of 1933 the question of the steps, if any, to he taken to safeguard the interests of the inhabitants of 'British'* Basidu in the event of our evacuating the station there came up for consideration and that sir R. Hoare supported a suggestion by the political Resident that Colonel Fowle should be authorised to spend a sum not exceeding £300 sterling in cash payments to enable any who feared retribution to settle elsewhere and to compensate any who were deprived of properties (P.Z.8H43/33). The Foreign Office supported the Minister and we called for a further repc._ papers submitted to the Under secretary of State on P.Z.8&amp;17/33. In an interim report of 23rd February 1934 (P.Z.1281/34) the Resident remarked that the population was actually rather larger than he had anticipated and suggested that a sum of £400 would be safer* In his letter of 20th torch (P. z.2140/34) he gave some supplementary information which seemed to suggest that the problem was possibly less acute than he had thought might be the case, but concluded rt It is, I think, impossible to cross the t's and dot the i*s in detail over this Basidu population business* The only thing to ao it seems to me is to extract the £400 from the Treasury, which I realise of course may not be particularly easy, and then let me have as free a hand as possible in itsj expenditure*. The papers were sent to the Foreign Office at the time, but it was informally agreed, as there was no immediate likelihood of our evacuating Basidu, that it would be better to postpone consideration until some decision hua been taken by H.M.G 3/Now that it has been decided in principle to evacuate Basidu and Henjam, subject to alternative acconsnodation being made available, and that we have made a distinct advance in the detailed examination of Khor f^uwai, the Foreign Office think that it would be well to clear the ground as regards compensation at Basidu, and hr* Baggallay, on instructions, has asked me whether India would be prepared to pay half of the sum of £400 if the Treasury were prepared to pay the other half* i said I would put this up for orders. 4. Biere is good reason to hope that we shall succeed in avoiding any Indian contribution to the development of the naval base at Bahrein (we have in fact so far avoided making any contribution to the purchase value of the land), and that it will be possible to confine any Indian contribution to the development of Khor Quwai to such charges (we are not very clear as to their nature or amount) as India at present meets in respect of the depot at Henjam. At an earlier stage, when there was some hope of our being able to secure the retention of the Henjam depot in return for an annual rent, India was prepared to pay half of this. A** /**-/'* On the whole, as the (amount is very small and India has always been very closely associated with Basidu, where there are, incidentally, Indian Navy graves the position of which we shall have to try to safeguard at trie time of any evacuation, I think, if you see no objection, that we might ask Mr* Metcalfe whether the Government of India would . be prepared to contribute.

He then asked the tax collector for Qism where the British territory ended and the tax collector informed him that the British say it ends at the white mound near the customs post.

Monsieur le Ministre, I learn that on February llth a Persian Customs official took a census of the inhabitants of British Basidu and issued Persian passports to them informing them that they should use them 'when visiting Persian places”; furthermore that on March 4th last (Esfand 13th) the tax collector of Kishu Island sent messages to the owners of date gardens situated within the British concession at Basidu demanding the payment of taxes and threatening to send police to enforce payment. 2. Such acts cannot be regarded as inconsistent ■ with the status quo agreement which formed the subject of Mr. Mallet’s conversation with Your Excellency on October 15th last and I feel confident that Your Excellency will ensure that suitable instructions are at once sent to the local authorities. 3. I had the honour to make a similar representation in my note No. 126 of March 17th 1933 (Esfand His Excellency Mirza Seyyid Bagher Khan Kazeni, Minister for Foreign Affairs.mmmm (Esfand 26th 1311).

Sir, lith reference to my despatch No. 130 of March 15th last, enclosing a copy of a note which I had addressed to the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs on the subjects of attempted Persian taxation at Basidu and the registration of the inhabitants of the British area as Persians, I have the honour to transmit to you the accompanying copy of a note in reply which I have just received from Mirza Seyyid Bagher Khan Kazemi. 2. This note is rather what I expected to receive and it is couched in language which seems to represent an effort on the Minister’s part not to be more than usually aggressive. At the same time his interpretation of the status quo , which must be read in connection with his note of January 2nd, a copy of which was enclosed in effect that ’’the Persian Government have never recognised, and never will recognise any kind of right belonging to the British Government at Basidu' - in other words, the st atus quo as the Persian Government understand it leaves Basidu to Persia. 3. This argument is obviously so extravagant that it may be necessary to controvert it, if we intend to cling to Basidu as a pawn in the treaty negotiations, if ever they mature. Before taking up the challenge, however, I prefer totwa.it the expression of your views on Rj^it Honourable Sir John Simon, G.C.S.I., etc., etc., uto., my despatch No. 12_of January 12th last, postulates in The Foreign Offiou.on the widen issues raised in my telegram Saving No. 5 Larch 12th. In the meanwhile my note of March 15th will have left Kazemi with no reason to complain that he has not been duly warned not to stir up fresh trouble at Basidu. It is just conceivable that my note may act as a deterrent, and in any case I think it unnecessary to j eply to Kazemi 1 s latest effusion until such time as the Persians proceed to the actual levying of the date tax or to the conscription of the inhabitants of the British area If I get word that either of these things has happened I shall find it necessary to ask you for instructions as to the course of action to be adopted. Meanwhile, if Kazemi refers to the question, I propose to say that my note was intended as a caveat, which His Excellency would be wise not to ignore. 4. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No. 62), and to the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (No. 56). I have, etc. (Signed) R.H.

Ho. 47869 dated 89th Esfand 1, (20th March 1934). Monsieur le Ministre, I have duly received Your Excellency’s note dated the 24th Ssfand (March 15th) No. 119 concerning the steps which the representatives of the Imperial Government, hy way of executing their duties, have taken at Basidu.

Personally, I do not think that it would be necessary ( as suggestee in your savIngram of 14th March, No. &amp; to Foreign Office ) to inform the Persian Government that **our abandonment of Basidu was result of careful study of our title and we ha&amp; reached conclusion that it might be successfully attacked .

I shall be glad if you will explain rather more fully and preferably by bag, your grounds for this opinion, and let me have at the same time information as to steps or soundings which you have taken with a view to resumption of negotiations. When my telegram No ,12 ( of January 29th) was sent, possibility was considered of meeting situation there envisaged by direct appeal to Shah. Has this situation now arisen, and if so do you recommend such an appeal or do you consider that unsatisfactory attitude of Persian Ministers is merely reflection of Shah’s own attitude? Judging from Persian Government's recent statements regarding status qu o in respect of Basidu, and their consistent attitude from the beginning as regards treatment of Bahreinis in Persia, it seems doubtful whether there is much chance of their furnishing assurance on lines you suggests You appreciate of course that alternative policy suggested m . n p- f vrvnr telegram would involve reversal of paragraphs 4 and 5 ol your reicgiam previous“T* « ft. 4 HQ DIST3IBUII Telegram (en clalr) from Sir R.

As two particular comments I will say that I do not think present moment suitable one for abandoning Basidu in view of recent attitude of Persian Government as shown by treatment of Mr. Sykes and Bahreinis, by accusation that we are stirring up trouble in Baluchistan, by highly disobliging replies to representations on one or two matters of less importance and above all by delay in resuming treaty negotiations which may now be regarded, as ostentatious I think in fact that abandonment would be regarded as evidence that pressure pays and we should be worse off whether or not negotiations are resumed than before. Secondly I do not entirely share views expressed in paragraph 2 as similar attempts to levy taxes have been made at intervals since 1928. What I should regard as ideal line would be to sexy to Persian Government 'If you wish to resume negotiations please furnish a formal assurance that you will act in the spirit of the status quo agreement until negotiations are either concluded or abandoned; this means that you will stop persecuting Bahreinis in Persia, molesting Arab dhows on high seas and taxing inhabitants of Basidu.

Tnis would of course mean withdrawal of ran- -&gt;ead of Baluchistan railway to Dalbandln\ If Persian replv were ups-atiuo , , * xs negative we should proceed to abandon Basidu and begin to Prepare naval station at Bahrein informing Persian Government that as soon as it waa ready we should evacuate Henjam. We should also imorm them that our abandonment of Basidu was result of Cai,eiUl GtU ° y 01 0Ur title am wc haa reached conclusion .hat it might be successfully attacked. We had simultaneousIv exailined ^nec+i-n ^ r , ‘ ‘ irjea question ox Bahrein, Iamb and Slrrl ; We had no doubt s whatsoever about two first and with regard to last we were content not to disturb status-quo though we regarded Persian title as doubtful. If the Persian Government showed signs of taking up this challenge whether directly by an appeal to the LeagUe 0r directly by molesting Arab dhows and persecuting Bahreinis we would take the initiative by forcing an issue on one or other of these disputes and take j.t to League if necessary. Whole of above represents I fear counsel of perfection but I put it fonward b^m^Qo t -u , ^ ... u .Lu.u.,axu. uecause i am becoming more and more convinced that until the ghost of Persian pretensions to Bahrein is laid our position with the increase of Persian activity in the Gulf and of growing belief here that the Persian army is a serious factor will become „„,$ 152 becouie increasingly difficult. Shah has all the proverbial characteristics of a bully. Most practical course with regard to immediate Basidu issue is to protest against taxation as we have done on previous occasions, to advise inhabitants net uo oiler actual resistance and refund the trifling sum which may be extracted from them. I -u11j realize - and it is a point on which Ivlr. Mallet who has just been to Basidu lays stress - that for officers commanding His Majesty’s sloops passive acquiescence in these Persian encroachments is moSu galling. But I can see no a.ltemative at present ii I am right in believing that simple abandonment of Basidu would now be bad tactics. Repeated to Government of India No. 1 Saving and Bushire No. 4 Saving.2* Previous views of His Majesty's Government as regards remaining at Henjam if possible, and as regards reference to League of Bahrein question and other questions involving position of His Majesty's Government vis-a-vis of Arab States of Persian Gulf. Further problems which this course would raise are that withdrawal from Henjam to Bahrein could not he carried out without appreciable time-lag, and that there might be danger of s erious repercussions on Anglo-Persian Oil Company and in general on British interests in Persiae If, however, it is clear to you that some drastic move on our part is required if any treaty settlement in reasonably near future is to be achieved, it will be necessary for His Majesty's Government to consider possible courses of action, including, no doubt, proposals in your telegram. In that case it would be useful if you would develop them more fully by despatch treating also the three points mentioned at the end of the preceding paragraph 0 As regards immediate question of taxation at Basidu* I auait result of representations referred to in your telegram NOo59 (of March 13th), Repeated to India No.11 and Bushire No.12.Prom Dated Received Political Resident In the Persian Gulf to Tehran, Eushire March 7th, 1934, March 26th, 1934 , xxxxxxxx Addressed to Tehran No,44, Copy by air mall to Secretary of State for India, ” 8 Government of India, Senior Naval Officer, My immediately preceding telegram repeat Nog Senior Naval Officer^ telegram No. 1611 of March 5th and H*M C So Fowey’s telegram No c 0940 of March 5th.

' 2. There are no British Indian subjects at Basidu. The local inhabitants, except a few Arabs from the other side of the Gulf presumably must be Persian subjects since it is agreed that the concession is Persian soil. 3. I concur with the Foreign Office that there would be no risk of the five ex-slaves reverting to slavery. 4. I think the number of the local inhabitants, who have so compromised themselves with the Persians on Pur behalf that it would be desirable to arrange for their expatriation, is small. In any case I do not think that it would be advisable for us to make arrangements for their expatriation. If there are any individuals who find themselves oppressed, they can easily make their own arrangements for getting away by dhow, and out of the fund which I have — at least I trust I will have it — I can assist them. ; The obvious area which they will make for is the 2 9lv?AK 'E -» Arab coast where with the assistance received from me h'd/t J; fi they can set up house afresh.2 As a matter of fact I feel that the only “oppression” that the Basiduvians (Isupnose that is the correct plural) will experience will he that of all other Persians under the Persian Government: Taxes and Conscription, and this they have escaped for many years owing to our “occupation'. So they are that much to the good. 6. It is, I think, impossible to cross the t's and dot the i's in detail over this Basidu popu lation business. The only thing to do, it seems to me, is to extract the four hundred pounds from the Treasury, which I realise of course may not be parti cularly easy, and then let me have as free a hand as possible in its expenditure.

The Law Officers' Opinion that the despatch was based on a fa: 'rights' at Basicm are, in fact, of has shewn, I think, that it would be impossible to contest the view that all the present inhabitants of Basidu who were born wer® feorn there are Persian sublets. it is possible that so*«e of them j^ay also Imre either British nationality or the status of British protected persons in spite of the fact that they were born on Persian soil, but wven so, that would only give the® dual nationality and they would have to be regardeu as eraian subjects wb‘le in Persia (including Basidu)• 4. In the course of the dispute arising out of the muair incident, the Persians, as you kno-&gt; have stated in writing their view that the whole of Basidu is Persian territory; they could not, therefore, logically deprive the present inhabitants of Basidu of their property on the basis of the Persian laws governing the ownership of property by foreign nationalEqually, we on our side could/130 coulo not show any logical grounds for intervening on the behalf once the Bo-oalled concession has been on tlieip The H renaition ft shoo* to these people, who no doubt believe that Basidu is and will always remain British territory. one cannot out sympathise with the®, but there is also a good deal to be said for the view that they are lucky, as Persian subjects, to have enjoyed imamitj from Persian iu&amp;laduiin 1 stration for so long, and we can see no practical way of lessening the shock or of helping them* 5. Perhaps you would consider the matter further in the light of this letter, and let us have your views? The India Offiee, as you will see from the enclosed copy of an express letter to Bush!re, are also asking Fowls for further information as to the population of 'British” Basidu and the nationality of its residents, and for his general comments on the question whether any steps could and should be taken to protect their interests In the event of our surrendering our 'rights” on the conclusion ) of a satisfactory treaty settlement* 6*/6.

We are very much in the dark as to the number of inhabitants of 'British* Basidu and their nationality/^ nor is it very clear from the reports which we have had from time to time that any of them have taken so prominent a part on our side that they would be likely to be penalised in the event of the Concession being handed over. We are therefore asking the Political Resident for a report on this point and are taking the opportunity to ask him at the same time for any comments on the general question. He has had toilet’s despatch of 12th August and your covering letter of 21st December, and we are sending him also a copy of the present letter. 3, Fowls's report, when received, may make some diff ore nee to the f = *v' ttv position. to-*ti however, v^-fecil toa-V -wsvirv i.o- in the-.stated in ynnr Ih- t£a^.. cip^WictoH-QQe we concur In the issue of the draXi^'itfhich leaves it open to ifewe to submit further recommendations once Fowle*s report has been received, subject to the addition in the penultimate paragraph* of the words 'The India Office, as you will see from the express letter of .which I enclose a copy, are also asking Fowle for further information as to the population of '’British* Basidu, the nationality of its residents, and for his general comments on the question of what, if any, steps can or should be taken to protect their interests in the event ol our surrendering our rights in the concession on a satisfactory general treaty settlement.'1925 5000 G.33 Ajj^~ y r Draft Paper. yz $ if] © 185 political Department.

I no?/ enclose a copy of Mallet’s despatch of the 12th August on this subject, together with the draft of a semi-official letter which I propose, unless you see serious objection, to send Hoare in reply. 2. I need not dwell on our reasons for holding up the circulation of this despatch: the various phases of the Basidu question rendered it impossible to deal v/ith this point at all satisfactorily until now, and as you ??ill see our vie?/, subject to any observations vhich you may have to make, is that the despatch was based on false premises and that the ^suggestions wnich it J.G.

You will have seen that in his most recent telegram advocating the immediate abandonment of the concession the Senior Naval Officer has proposed that we should evacuate 'ex-slaves* and those who would be penalised for helping us during our occupation. The point seems to us to be worth investigating, and you may perhaps think it well to refer it to ^owle for his observations. 4. Meanwhile may I ask you to let me know oy telepnone whether you have any comments to make on the drait letter to Hoar elr Britiah Legation, aewm. ugvtst 12th 1933, fy*l ^2?ju6j?8217 Sir, \933 1 MU &lt; ll1 * 11 flth reference to Buahire deep Etches Hoc. 28B of June 26th, Ji-73 iS of July 8th, to thle Legation, ceplea of ^ich have Been eent to the India Office, regarding the position at Basl&amp;u# I hare the honour to report that the use of the ter»» .Drltisli suujeet J and ‘’Persian subject 18 to describe residents in the British enclave at Basidu has suggested to mind the desir ability of inserting some provision in the draft general treaty to protect the interests of sueh of the resident® as are genuinely British subjects or British protected persons* 8* X have no information as to the present day population of the enclave, but X presume it is greater than the twenty souls mentioned in Volume IX of Uorimer 1 ® Gazetteer* In any case the population Is, X believe, largely composed of former slaves who have escaped from the Arab coast or of the descendants of such slaves. If these people, or their forbears, were ever British subjects or British protected persons, they presumably still enjoy British nationality or protection* Similarly those persons who originally moved into the enclave from Persian territory, or whose forbears did so, presumably continue to be Persian subjects. The position of the enclave is in fact too indeterminate internationally for birth therein to confer any nationality at all upon the child so born, with the result that the nationality of the father becomes the only guide. 3. Whether this theory is correct or not, it seems to me that in the negotiation® for the general treaty we should take the line. first The Right Honourable Sir John Simon 3*0*3* X*, etc*, ete., etc., FOREIGN OFFICE.first that all British sheets and protected persons resident in |i© enclave at the tine of its surrender must he recognised a® ioreign subjects by the Persian Government, Irrespective of the present or any future nationality law, and secondly that these persons must be left in possession of any property they may possess in the enclave, irrespective of the present or any future law restricting the ownership of property by foreigners. As for the children ol British subjects or protected persons born in the former enclave after its surrender, I do not see that it will be possible to avoid the application in their cases of Articles 1 ( 4 } or 1(B) of the law of 1929, by which they will be Persian subjects till they reach the age of eighteen. 4* It may be possible to secure the protection of the present inhabitants by the addition of a third paragraph to the Basidu article (Article V) in the general treaty# X enclose a rough draft of such a paragraph, as an illustration of what X have in mind, but X realise that any addition of the kind is likely to be most unpalat able to the Persian Government and that it may be necessary to attempt to secure our desiderata by some less formal arrangement# Moreover if the number of British subjects or protected persons, ©specially those owning agricultural property, is very small indeed it may not be worth while troubling about this question at all, but better to assist those who wish to do @0 to leave^Persia# 5. Xi will probably in any case be desirable for some British official to visit Basidu at the time of the surrender of the enclave in order to make lists of those residents who are British subjects or protected person® and of their property, to issue nationality document® and, if some arrangement has been made with the Persian Government, to secure the'recognition of these documents by the local Persian authorities# 6# X am sending copies of this despatch to the $ ©reign SecretarySecretary to the Oovermaent of India (Ho. 160), the Acting political ttealdejit in the Persian Gulf at Bushire (Ho.

Political Resident in the Persian Gulf recommends x (sic: ? recommended) solution is for sum of money to be placed at his disposal to assist hard cases. He thinks most of inhabitants will prefer to remain even if exposed to Persian taxation, conscription, etc. , and that as they are so poor and few in numbers they are unlikely to suffer from discrimination. It is possible however that some might be deprived on one excuse or other of their date gardens. In the circumstances x of proposed x immediate evacuation, guarantees on such points are clearly unobtainable. But even if evacuation took place by agreement and ,guarantees could be extracted they might prove useless once we were gone. I therefore urge that Political Resident in cne Persian Gulf be authorised to spend sum not exceeding £500 sterling in cash payments to enable any who fear retribution to settle elsewhere, and to compensate any who are deprived of properties. I submit that it is better to pay this relatively small sum than risk accusation now or later of deserting those who look to us for protection or hold up immediately evacuation if this is considered clearly desirable on political grounds.

There is one other point: the Legation have recently pat forward an entirely new proposal relating to the safeguarding of the interests of inhabitants of Basidu after the concession has been handed over. This is a tiresome and thorny question, and we have felt it better to ignore it when drafting the present instructions, and to deal with it separately at a later stage. We will, therefore, write to you about this separately later, unless the outcome of the present discussions regarding Basidu renders this unnecessary, but for the sake of completeness, and because this is the only point still outstanding, I have mentioned the matter here by way of warning.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000186_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/3822</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000186</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/3822</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 30/103 'Basidu: Position of the inhabitants of Basidu in the event of evacuation by His Majesty's Government.'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1933/1935</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-08-01T23:20:19</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">fre</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (202 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the main foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 204; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.

Basidu was a former naval depot that had been under British control since [circa] 1820. However, in the opinion of the Law Officers, Britain had only a 'shadowy' claim to Basidu; and when the Government of Persia decided to claim Basidu as Persian territory, Britain decided to arrange for the evacuation of those inhabitants who wished to leave. The evacuation, and the hauling down of the British flag, took place on 12 April 1935 (folio 10).The papers cover: discussion of British rights over Basidu; consideration of the effect of British withdrawal on the inhabitants; the visit of Persian officials and the taking by them of a census of the inhabitants; agreement with the proposal of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf that £400 should be made available for the costs of the evacuation (half to be paid by HM Treasury, half by the Government of India); the conscription of local persons by the Persian authorities; and arrangements for the final evacuation of Basidu by the Royal Navy.The file includes correspondence from HM Minister, Tehran; the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; the Foreign Office; and British naval officials.The French language content of the papers consists of a single folio (a suggested addition to article V of the General Treaty, on folio 193).The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Military service</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Basidu</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Evacuation</topic></subject><subject><topic>Sovereignty</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000186#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
