I mention thjs because if Sir Rupert or yourself meet the Shaikh of Sharjah, which it will be difficult for you not to de during your forthcoming visit, he will almost certainly raise the matter of the agreement or the firearms cr both. I 4e net think that the news of Shakhbut's having been allotted the Kalbs rifles has yet leaked out (he has not yet sent in for them) but when it does, you may expect the other Rulers to press forward vigorously in the M personal approach', if it is seen to 'pay off'.

I have had further discusslens with Shaikh Saqr en this peint, but all that he will say is that he '‘leaves it to me to be Judge”, and that he will “agree to this, cr more than this, if the Government considers it fair and just”. This is merely his way ©f saying that he considers it unfair and unjust and does net in fact agree at all, but that he will not break off negotiations on the point. If we insist, he will eventually sign, bux he will not “agree', - he will sign under protest and consider that he has been unfairly treated. I do not imagine that his sense of grievance would have any lasting or serious results, but the point would undoubtedly be raked up for the next fifty years whenever we wanted anything else from him, and used to bedevil negotiations then. 3. If payment were made retrospectively to April 1st 1950 the sum involved would only be £s.12,600 approximately (Rr.700 a month for 18 months) end even that would not be handed over, but set against the dect for the Fort Buildings.

We have no authority to offer retrospective payment of rent for the rest house and you should continue if you see no objection, to try to persuade the Ruler to accept the increase from the date of the completion of your negotiations. On the other hand there is some force in his argument and the case appears to he on all fours with the question of the payment of the Guards. We are therefore asking for discretion to offer payment retrospectively to April 1st, 1950 (c.f. your letter 0436/9/51 March 21st to Felly) if this proves to he the only point on which we cannot reach agreement.

Per the former he demanded Rs*1000/- at first, and slowly CAme down te his irreducible minimum of Rs*600/-, I having started from Rs.100/- as offered by Andrew* As he refused to come below Rf* 600/- I finally disclosed the figure of Bs.420/-, and said that if he did not accept it, there would merely be further delay while the matter was referred* He then offered the extension for nothing, but finally allowed himself t© be persuaded to take Es*420/-* Per the Rest House he claimed that the figure ef Ks.1000/- had been agreed te, and when I said that it was clear from the papers that it had been asked for but never agreed te, he said that that was net his understanding of what had passed between his father and Jackson, and the discussion continued. I tried to suggest that he would lose more by delay than by a prompt acceptance, but this merely led him te ask the date from which the increased rent would be payable. As there was no indication te any other effect, I said from the date of signature. This he entirely refused to accept claiming that it should run from the time negotiations for the renewal of the existing Agreement opened* I said that clearly It should run from the time agreement was reached, and that no agreement had yet been reached. He then claimed that agreement had been reached substantially in his father’s letter N©*187 ef 9th February 1949, in which he accepted all the terms ef the new agreement but held out for a rent of Bs.1000/- for the Rest House and the higher rate of pay for guards which we subsequently ceded (Stebart’s 119-0436 ef 28th January 1950 refers)* As Stobart pointed out in his letter 0436/2/26 ef 13th November, 1950, delay subsequent te the granting ef a power ef attorney to Shaikh Mohammed, notified te you in our letter -0436 ef 8th January 1950, can net fairly be held te be the Ruler's fault, and in this matter ©f the Rest House rent, (as was the case in the matter ef back pay for the guards) the delays in London ef the past 18 months are costing him a considerable amount of money te which he has a reasonably claim to consider himself entitled. I should be grateful te know what is the best offer which we can make to him for the date from which the increased Rest House rent can run« 3* In the matter ef the telegrams, Shaikh Saqr accepts the figure ef 2000 words, but had not understood that there was te be any restriction ef the destination to Bahrain, and I can find nothing te suggest that any such qualification was included in the original offer. 4. Can you say whether the map referred to in the exchange ef letters about the Reayl Air Force camp is in fact available for inclusion in the final version?.5, Should the final version be ty^ed in double columns, with Arabic text on the left?. If so, I should be grateful if tnis could possible done in Bahrain, as it appears from your letter C/TC 8 of 14th January 1950 that at least five and prcoably six or seven copies (if the Foreign Office require more than one, and spares are wanted) will be required.

The Commanding Officer of the Kury Royal Air Force here has not so far received any instructions about the ammunition to be handed over with the rifles. H.B.M's Political Agent, Bahrain. C.J. Polly Esquire., 0.5 «S. ,y BRITISFI RESIDENCY CONFIDENTIAL, BAflRATN, 1389/29 18th July, 1951. Under cover of his letter 49/12/48 of the 10th December 1948 Sir Rupert sent you the draft text of the revised civil air agreement, together with an exchange of letters concerning the use of the airfield by military aircraft, which it was desired to negotiate with the Shaikh of Sharjah. The late Shaikh’s provisional agreement to these drafts, as subsequently modified by us in certain respects and subject to our recon sideration of the payments to be made to him, was given in a letter which he addressed to the Political Officer, Trucial Coast on February 9th 1949 (your reference C/^-63 of February 12th 1949). Agreement has now been reached by the Departments concerned in London on the final text to which it is desired that the Shaikh’s agreement be obtained and I enclose here with four copies of (i) The Heads of Agreement. (ii) The exchange of letters about the use of the airfield by military aircraft. (iii) The Air Navigation Regulations and I am to request you to arran e for the Shaikh's agreement to these texts to be obtained. 2. Amendments to the Heads of Agreement have been reduced to the minimum and the following are the only ones of any substance :- Article 1 . The word 'operate' 1 has been substituted for 'use', since we are not claiming exclusive rights of usage and the second part of the article has been deleted in view of the possibility of our wishing to extend the existing airfield or to establish a new one at some time in the future. Article 3% which is based on the corresponding article in the recently concluded Kuwait Civil Air Agreement, is self-explanatory. Its inclusion is not absolutely necessary, but there does not appear to be any ground on which the Shaikh could object to it. Article ll(i) . The rates of pay for the guards, as also those presented in the exchange of letters, are those which Wilton recently offered to the Shaikh and to which the latter agreed. (Pinhey's letter C13/3/13/51 of I/.arch 2?th to me refers.) They are described in terms of basic pay and cost of living allowance as proposed in paragraph 3 of Sir Rupert's despatch No.14 of larch 1st 1949 (81/8/49). Article 11(ii) . The figure of Rs.1420/- per month comprises the ori- ginal rent of^ ?s. 1000/- plus an increase of Rs.420/- in respect of the recent extension. This figure has been arrived at by assessing the rent of the extension (37 acres) at the same rate as the original rent for the original airfield (Rs.1000/- for 88 acres). This increased sum may be offered to the Ruler retrospectively to July 22nd 1950, the date on which the land was handed over to the Royal Air Force {your Agency's letter 013/3/16/51 of April 16th). /Article 11(iii) C.J. Felly, Esq., O.B.E., Political Agent, Bahrain.Confidential Copy of despatch No. 63(&lt;V. 1394/15/802) of the 3rd August, 1949, from the Foreign Office, London to Lr. H.Cr. Jakins, acting Political Resident, Bahrain. I should he glad if you would refer to the Political Resident’s despatch No.14(81/8/49) of the 1st 1\ arch on the renewal of the Civil &gt;iir Agreement with the Shaikh of Sharjah. 2. In paragraph 5 of that despatch he suggested \ that if a satisfactory arrangement was reached on the other points, he should he authorised to inform the Shaikh that he would he permitted to send telegrams free of charge uu to a limit of 3,0C0 words annually irrespective of class and distinction. 3. The ! inistry of Civil Aviation have made the point that the value of the Sharjah agreement to them is considerably less than that of the Kuwait or Bahrain agreements, and they should on grounds of economy prefer the concession to be left as small as possitle. They suggest therefore, provided you see no objection, that you should ask first offer the Shaikh 2000 words a year between Sharjah and Bahrain free of charge. 4. If however, you cannot by offering this concession induce the Shaikh to sign the agreement, you may in the final instance increase the offer to 3000 words, and extend the concession to cover not merely messages between Sharjah and Bahrain, but all messages irres;ective of destination. 6, No other points, as far as we know, are now outstanding, and I hope that it may now he possible to bring negotiations to a successful conclusion.

Officer, Trucial Coast, Sharjah. With the compliments of H.B.M's Political ngcnt at Bahrain (P.Gulf) v DatedNo. 55 (G.A. 58/5) CONFIDENTIAL . FOREIGN OFFICE, S. W. 1. 6th April, 1951. Sir, I have to refer to Your Excellency’s letter 1389/4 of the 21st February regarding the airfield at Sharjah and to earlier correspondence on the subject of the Sharjah Air Agreement. 2. I now enclose three copies of redrafts of the Air Agreement and of the exchange of letters, which were origi nally sent to you under cover of despatch No.60 of the 19th November 1948, and which received the provisional approval of the late Shaikh in February, 1949 (see the enclosure to your despatch No. 14 of the 1st March, 1949)- Amendments to this Agreement have been kept to a minimum in order not to raise new difficulties in negotiations with the present Shaikh. Draft Air Navigation Regulations are also enclosed. They are based upon those of Kuwait, with certain modifica tions. The amendments to the Agreement and Regulations have not yet been finally agreed with the Ministry of Civil Aviation, and the draft texts are being sent to you for your preliminary comments and suggestions in order to save time. You should not, however, make any approach to the Shaikh until final clearance is given. 3. The following comments upon the new draft are explana tory of the changes that have been made in the old agree ment. The title has been replaced by the form used in the Kuwait Agreement. In Article 1 'operate' has been substitu ted for 'use', since we are not claiming exclusive rights of usage, and also 'aerodrome or aerodromes' for 'an air station and an aerodrome', since there seems to be no useful distinction to be made between them. In view of the /fact His Excellency Lieutenant Colonel Sir Rupert Hay, K. C. I. E. , C. S. I. Etc. , etc. , etc. , Bahrain. f / j &gt; 5fact that His Majesty's Government may wish to extend the existing aerodrome or to establish a new aerodrome in the future, it is thought advisable to delete the second part of the old Article 1. 4- Article 2 is the same as before. The insertion of the new Article 3 (which is on the same lines as the correspon ding article in the Kuwait Agreement) would enable His Majesty's Government to legislate for certain procedures and rules for the use of the aerodrome. This insertion is not absolutely essential and if you think it may raise, or con tribute to, difficulties, you may omit it. Article 3 is a slightly amended version of the old Article 4 and is on the lines of the similar provision in the Kuwait Agreement. Articles 6 to 9 are virtually unchanged. A slight drafting amendment has been made to the last sentence of Article 10. 5- Article II(i ) The figures for the pay of the guards have been brought up to date (as also in the draft exchange of letters on the Royal Air Force camp). The pay is des cribed in terms of basic pay and living allowance, as was suggested in paragraph 3 of your despatch Ho. 14 of March 1st, 1949. Article II(ii ). This figure takes account of the ex tension of the airfield last July (Mr. Sarell's letter GA 33/9 of 21st March). Article .Il(iii) . This figure is that which you were given discretion to offer in paragraph 2 of Foreign Office telegram Ko.240 of 6th May 1949. It is understood that at present payments at the old rate of Rs.300 per month are being paid into a suspense account against the money advanced by His Majesty's Government to the Shaikh for the building of the house. When this loan has been paid off the lent will be paid direct to the Ruler. 6. Article 12 has been amended as v/as suggested by you in your letter 1339/4 of the 21st February. The second sentence Ox the old article 12 (new Article 13) has been omitted. /This- 3 - This is in accordance v/ith the Kuwait Agreement and the sentence neither looks well nor is it really consistent with modern practice. Article 14 has “been inserted, and is required in order to provide for the Air navigation Regula tions. 7. The Exchange of Letters concerning the Royal Air Force camp are substantially the same as before. The Regulations themselves are on much the same lines as those annexed to the Kuwait Agreement, except for extensive redra fting of Articles 1,8, 10, 11, 14 and 15, and in particular the definition of '’authorised person' in Article 15(a). We should be grateful for your advice on the .vords in square brackets in Articles 4 and 7. 8. In the course of his recent call at the Foreign Office, Shaikh halid stated on behalf of his uncle that no payments &lt; ^ 1 landing fees had been made by the British Overseas Airways corporation, that the rent of the lest house was not being paid, and that nothing had been received in rent for the aerodrome. Ke was promised that these matters would be looked into. According to the Ministry of Civil Aviation, International Aeradio Limited should be collecting landing fees and passing on the payment direct to the Ruler, and I should be grateful if you could confirm that this is in fact being done. The explanation so far as the rest house is concerned is presumably that the payment is being made into the suspense account. If this is the case, you will no doubt explain the position to the Ruler. As to the ent for the airfield, it is presumed that payment has in fact been made. 9« Shaikh khalid also referred to the promise of rifles and free telegrams made by His Majesty’s Government to the late shaikh. As regards rifles, you suggested, in paragraph 6 of your despatch 14 of the 1st March, 1949 that the Shaikh should be given 74 rifles and 7,400 rounds of ammu nition to arm his guards and the Air Ministry’s approval of this proposal was obtained. In accordance v/ith your tele- /gramgram Ko. 274 of the 8th June, 1949, it is assumed that they have been consigned to the Officer Commanding, Royal Air Force, Sharjah. I should be grateful if you would confirm that they are available to be issued to the Shaikh. 10. In paragraph 4 of Hr. Rouse*s letter W1394/15/802 of the 3rd August 1949, you were given authority to offer the Shaikh the right to send 3,000 words by telegram free of charge. This privilege cannot be enjoyed, however, until the Agreement has been signed. 11. Every effort will be made to secure final interdepart mental agreement to the enclosed texts, and subject to any comments you may have to make, it is hoped that it will be possible to secure the Shaikh’s consent, and to arrange for the early signature of the Agreement. I am v/ith great truth and regard. Sir, Your Excellency’s obedient Servant, (For the Secretary of State) W.

(13^9/1/51 ) BAHRAIN 15th January, I9f&gt;1 • Owln^; to 8o:ne oversight we do not seem to have reported the fact that the airfield at Sharjah has been extended by U51 yards at the request of the Royal Air Force, As the mat ter was of great urgency, vide Air ttaff Liaison Ofiicer, Bahrain’s letter Ho. ASLO/107/7/Crg. of the 28th June, 1950, of which I enclose a copy, the work was taken in hand immedia tely with the a proval of the Shaikh and the airfield was extended to the required length in time to take the jet planes which were being flown at the time to India and Pakis tan. 2. At the time the extension was made, we did not realise that the Sharjah airfield was the property of the Ministry of Civil Aviation and not of the Air Ministry. The cost of the extension has presumably been borne by the latter. 3 . I enclose a copy of correspondence exchanged with the Ruler relating to the extension. It will be seen from this that the question of rent for it remains to be settled and that the acting filler in his letter has called attention to the delay in the execution of the new air agreement and in the payment of the increased salaries for the guards. Actually, an offer of rent for the extension of Rs.100 per month was made to the Ruler and he replied that this was negligible compared to the present day value of the land. I am strongly of opinion myself that the amount offered was inadequate. The original area rented from the Ruler under agreement with Imperial Airways is 88 acres and Rs.1000 per month is being paid for this as rent. The area of the extension is approxi mately 37 acres and the rent for this at the previous rate works out to Rs.420 per month. I do not tliinK we can rsasonaL&gt;i offer rent at a lower rate than that agreed in 1932 an&lt; it could well be argued that the Ruler would be justified in demanding a rate in excess of this in view of the general rise in prices which has occurred since then. I would request therefore that I may be authorised to offer up to Rs.420 per ionth if I find this necessary. 1 think the haikh will prbbatly be willing to accept this offer if the new air agreement is presented to him for signature at an early date. The increased payment should be made with effect from the date on which the additional land was actually taken over. I have nothing on record to show when this date was, and I am making enquiries, bat I believe it to be some time in July, 1950. 4. I am afraid this extension of the airfield and increase in the rent will necessitate some further amendments of the draft air agreement. I hope it will be possible to decide what form these should take at a very early date. The whole matter has now been pending for nearly three years and I was promised in oara 2 of Foreign Office telegram : o.433 of the 25th Octo ber, 1950 that the new copy of the draft air agreement and the draft air navigation regulations would be forwarded by bag as soon as possible. /V. .

It is understood that the matter is of considerable urgency, and as there is no time to approach Air Ministry to ascertain details of the airfield’s new lease before starting work, it is requested that the following information be supplied to the Officer Commanding, Royal Air Force Bahrain, at your earliest convenience. (a) Poes the new lease, now being negotiated by Air Minis try include the area required for extension of the runway as shown on the enclosed plan ? (b) May permission be granted for work to commence immediately ? (c) Can the Royal Air Force divert the existing track to Dubai to run around the end of the extended runway ? (d) May authority be granted to the Royal Air Force to halt traffic on the proposed new road when the runway is in use 7 (e) Can an undertaking be obtained from the dhaikh of Sharjah that no structuges forming flying obstructions will be built in the 15 approach funnel to the extension. Air Headquarters Iraq, have emphasised the urgency for work to comence at the earliest possible date and an early reply to the above queries would be greatly appreciated. ' I have the honour to be Sir, Your obedient Servant (G.S. Lewis) Squadron Leader, Air Staff Liaison OfficerBRITISH RESIDENCY, BAHRAIN. 21st February, 1951. Please refer to your letter GA 58/4 of the 1st February about the extension of the airfield at Sharjah. I agree that there was never any question of a map of the airfield being attached to the Agreement, but I think the amendment of Article 11 should be considered as well as that of Article 10. The draft of Article 11 now stands as amended in para 3 of Foreign Office des- patch No.o0( 5729/3/802) of the 19th November, 1948 . I would suggest that it should now read: ''In the present Agreement the expression 'the aerodrome' means the existing aerodrome at Sharjah and includes any extension which may be made to it and any other aerodrome which may be established hereafter in Sharjah terri tory by His Majesty*# Oovernmenu in agreement with the Shaikh.' Harpham, Esq., O.B.E., Foreign Office, London, S.W.l. (W.R. Hay)COPY y . 58/4) FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l. CONFIDENTIAL. 1st February, 1951 . Dear Sir Rupert, Please refer to your letter 1389/1/51 of the 15th January concerning the extension of the airfield at Sharjah. 2. The rent for the airfield falls upon the vote of the Ministry of Civil Aviation, and we are pressing them to agree to your proposal that an additional 420 rupees per month should be paid to the Shaikh retrospectively from July last year, or any date subsequently confirmed by 3. We very much regret the grievous delays in despatching the draft agreement and regulations for negotiation with the Shaikh. We are now awaiting legal advice on certain points of the regulations, and I hope that this time we shall be able to conclude the matter. In paragraph 4 of your letter you suggest that the airfield extension will involve amending the Agreement. Apart from the obvious alteration of Article 10(ii), I do not see that further changes are required. From our papers it does not appear that there was ever any question of a map of the airfield eing attached to the Agreement, although a map of the Royal Air Force Camp was attached to the exchange :of letters on facilities for military aircraft. Perhaps you could kindly confirm my understanding on this point. you. Yours sincerely W. Harpham. Lieutenant Colonel Sir Rupert Hay, K.C.I Bn it i sh Re s i de ncy, Bahrain. • i C.3.
